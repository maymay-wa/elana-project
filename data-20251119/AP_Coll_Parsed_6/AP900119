mayor marion barry turned over the duties 
and functions of his office to an aide friday after being 
formally charged with drug possession in an fbi sting that 
officials said included a videotape of barry smoking crack cocaine 
barry did not give up his office which he has held for 11 
years and retained authority to sign and veto legislation and 
approve contracts 
the drug charge added to the turbulence of the political 
situation in the nations capital where barry had already been 
under fire and the list of challengers for next novembers election 
had been growing jesse jackson the leader in early polls though 
he has said he would not run against barry said friday he felt 
only sorrow about the new development and would not talk politics 
federal prosecutors said barry tested positive for cocaine in 
blood and urine tests after he was taken into custody thursday 
night at a washington hotel his lawyer said friday he would plead 
innocent to the charge 
the fbi used a woman to get barry to the hotel room said a law 
enforcement source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the woman was identified by sources familiar with the case as 
rasheeda moore one source said ms moore agreed to cooperate with 
the fbis investigation of barry after she got into trouble with 
state authorities in california 
the washington times said in an extra edition friday afternoon 
that ms moore according to one law enforcement source agreed to 
cooperate with the fbi because she believed barry needed help 
because he had been addicted before and had been showing signs of 
being addicted again 
according to the newspapers account she invited barry to a 
party at the hotel but three of the partygoers were fbi agents 
barry the newspaper said was taking off his shirt when 
arrested but a narrative of the same events described by the 
washington post in saturday morning editions said barry had just 
started to put on his coat as if to leave when agents burst in to 
announce you are under arrest remain still sources for the 
two accounts were not named 
us attorney jay stephens denied that the mayor had been 
unlawfully entrapped by the operation saying prosecutors had found 
evidence of barrys predisposition to commit drugrelated crimes 
wherever there is predisposition there is not entrapment 
said stephens it was scrupulously fair to the subject of the 
investigation mr barry 
after fridays brief court hearing in even briefer remarks to 
reporters swarming around the federal courthouse barry said im 
going to leave here and go about the business of government 
but the mayors office issued a statement later which said he 
was temporarily giving up his daytoday mayors chores because of 
a need for time to handle his legal matters his concern for his 
family and because it is in the best interests of the citizens of 
washington dc 
he has been plagued in recent years by accusations of drug use 
as well as the corruption convictions of several top city 
officials he has repeatedly denied ever using or buying drugs 
barry had indicated he would seek a fourth term this november 
though opposing candidates have proliferated as his troubles have 
mounted a formal barry candidacy announcement scheduled for 
sunday was postponed indefinitely 
former democratic presidential candidate jackson who has 
campaigned against drugs across the country fueled speculation he 
would run for mayor when he moved to washington last year but 
jackson also has said he would not directly challenge barry a 
former civil rights colleague 
jackson said friday in chicago that the barry matter should be 
handled in a courtroom not a newsroom and that he was in no 
mood to deal with questions about politics 
in the statement released by his office barry said i want to 
assure my friends colleagues supporters fellow citizens the 
business community and the nation that this government will 
continue to operate at maximum performance i know i have a team of 
competent professionals who will continue to run the affairs of 
government while i devote some time to my legal case 
the statement which said he was turning over daytoday mayors 
duties to city administrator carol thompson was released after he 
huddled with cabinet members and political advisers 
sources commenting on condition they not be named said several 
cabinet members threatened to resign if barry did not step aside 
from most city affairs 
if convicted the mayor could face penalties of up to one year 
in jail and a 100000 fine said us attorney stephens 
barry was arrested at an fbirented hotel room that was being 
watched through a surveillance camera he gave a quantity of 
currency to a cooperating witness in return for the crack 
according to court papers filed by federal prosecutors 
mr barry put some of the crack cocaine in a smoking 
apparatus lit the crack cocaine and smoked it fbi agent ronald 
stern said in an affidavit i observed mr barry inhale on 
the lit smoking apparatus 
federal agents then entered the hotel room and arrested the 
mayor who officials said later tested positive for cocaine when 
blood and urine tests were given under a warrant he was taken to 
fbi headquarters and released on his own recognizance 
officers also took samples of the mayors hair which law 
enforcement authorities say can be used to determine drug use 
stephens said that barry went to the vista hotel in his 
limousine accompanied by security guards he entered on his own 
volition he went to the seventh floor on his own free will he put 
himself in that situation 
the prosecutor said the mayors arrest was part of a continuing 
investigation of a broad range of allegations against barry he 
later specified that the probe deals with fraud and city contracts 
as well as narcotics 
us magistrate deborah robinson allowed the mayor to remain 
free but ordered him to undergo drug tests every monday he also 
must make weekly phone calls to a pretrial services agency and will 
face another court appearance feb 5 
barrys court appearance came less than two hours before the 
sentencing of charles lewis a former friend of the mayor and now a 
cooperating government witness against barry for conspiracy to 
distribute cocaine when lewis pleaded guilty to the charge last 
year he told the judge he had given cocaine to the mayor 
lewis was sentenced to 15 months in prison but was given credit 
for time served and is to be released in may

indiana state health commissioner dr woodrow a 
myers jr was named new york citys top health official friday 
despite opposition to his aids policies by gay rights activists and 
a prominent aids researcher 
mayor david n dinkins announced the appointment of myers as 
city health commissioner just one day after several supporters on a 
search committee withdrew their backing among those who stopped 
supporting myers was dr mathilde krim cofounder of the american 
foundation on aids research 
myers supports indiana laws to keep government lists of those 
infected with the aids virus and to quarantine people who knowingly 
infect others 
the indiana official has said he wouldnt impose such policies 
in new york and would support the policies of dinkins who opposes 
quarantines and government lists 
despite the controversial aids policies in indiana myers has a 
national reputation as an aids expert he is credited with 
encouraging indiana doctors to treat aids patients and was 
instrumental in arranging schooling for ryan white a teenage 
aidsafflicted hemopheliac who received national attention when a 
local school board refused to enroll him 
myers also made headlines by resigning from his post as vice 
chairman of the presidents commission on hiv under ronald reagan 
to protest what he said were inadequacies with the group hiv or 
the human immunodeficiency virus causes aids 
on thursday krim and several other members of the search 
committee withdrew support from him krim cited profound 
differences between myers views and desirable public health 
policies 
im not the insensitive brutish fiend that some people have 
tried to make me out to be myers said this week 
myers on friday underscored that saying quarantine is not an 
effective health strategy 
myers 35 will earn 110000 a year as commissioner and also 
get an annual 22000 supplement as an assistant professor of 
medicine at the cornell university medical school 
in outlining the challenges facing the appointee dinkins 
referred to a recent study that found a man in bangladesh has a 
better chance of living past age 40 than a man in harlem

the new health commissioner drug and alcohol abuse cirrhosis 
violence and the spread of disease including the aids epidemic 
dinkins said 
there have been 23000 aids cases in new york and 12000 have 
died at least 200000 new yorkers and perhaps nearly twice that 
many have been infected with the virus 
protests continued friday afternoon with about 75 members of 
the aids coalition to unleash power picketing in front of city 
hall chanting no testing no quarantine no myers no way

sticky gobs of oil and grotesque 
portuguese menofwar blown ashore by an east wind have made the 
footing treacherous on some beaches in south florida 
the coast guard hadnt determined the source of the tarlike 
glop washed by strong winds and surf onto beaches around fort 
lauderdale 
its wet and clinging to everything thats floating said 
area resident pauline gerweck tourists are coming out covered 
head to toe this is scandalous 
the jellyfishlike menofwar whose sting can be dangerous to 
the allergic are flopping ashore from the keys to jupiter in palm 
beach county about a 200mile stretch but few stings have been 
reported because bathers are staying out of the water which has 
been stirred by rainshowers and rough seas 
i think with all the warnings people are staying out of the 
water bonnetta kaplan a lifeguard in pompano beach said 
wednesday when something like this happens we load the beach 
with signs 
two weeks ago hundreds of swimmers were stung in south florida 
when swarms of the jellyfish washed up on the beaches 
that coincided with some real nice sunny weather said capt 
bill pallowick of the fort lauderdale beach patrol there are 
probably 10 times more of them out there today but the weather is 
not good 
it was harder for beachgoing tourists to avoid the tar spots 
jim haskell a tourist from newburyport mass said the soles 
of his feet were black with oil after he strolled near anglins 
pier in lauderdalebythesea 
there were some little kids in the surf and they were just 
covered with it haskell said 
coast guard officer pete thiel in fort lauderdale said the 
coast guard twice inspected tankers anchored off the citys coast 
on wednesday but found no evidence of leaks 
huge oil tankers enter and leave port everglades daily and 
frequently anchor off fort lauderdale thiel said tankers sometimes 
pump oily bilge water into the ocean in violation of federal law

marion barry jr was a sharecroppers son who 
used the streetwise bravado he learned as a civil rights activist 
to become a savvy political insider who served more than a decade 
as mayor of the nations capital 
always claiming he could move as easily among royalty as among 
the citys poor barry shrugged off scandals involving top aides 
and allegations of drug abuse to win election three times to the 
citys top position 
during his tenure barry made the most of the limited power of 
the citys home rule charter to make himself the undisputed leader 
of the city government 
but barry was also under federal investigation during much of 
the period between 1984 and 1990 for his ties to drug suspects 
several of his friends have gone to jail and recent news reports 
suggested the wall of silence that prosecutors had tried to 
penetrate was crumbling as some former associates testified before 
a grand jury 
barry has always called himself a survivor pointing to the 
gunshot wound he suffered in the city hall building in 1977 as an 
example of how he could never be counted out 
he is not going to go out quietly said max berry a former 
key political adviser after the arrest 
berry who turned against barry after the mayors troubles last 
year added if he has not been telling the truth to the people 
hes going to face the possibility of resigning but he has always 
been a strong campaigner and a proud person what kind of effect 
this will have on his ego i dont know 
indeed barrys most recent boasts of political power were 
earlier this month 
a los angeles times profile got him into political hot water 
when he was quoted as boasting that he would cut his opponents 
off at the kneecaps and that jesse jackson whom barry had 
supported dont wanna run nothing but his mouth 
barry and his third wife effi have one son christopher who 
is 10 
barry was born on march 6 1936 to marion and mattie barry in 
the small mississippi delta town of itta bena and was raised in 
memphis after the death of his father a sharecropper 
my background is one of survival barry told the washington 
post a month before his first election as mayor in 1978 i mean i 
was lucky you know i used to run around with guys who went to 
prison or are dead i was lucky i was the one who didnt get 
caught by the police when we were out shooting dice or something 
barry did graduate work in chemistry at fisk university in 
nashville but was sidetracked on his way to a doctorate by the 
growing civil rights movement and left school with a masters 
degree he was the first national chairman of the student 
nonviolent coordinating committee which sent young people into 
the south to register black voters 
it was sncc that brought him to washington where he became 
immersed in local issues joining boycotts of the bus system 
with his second wife mary treadwell he helped found a black 
selfhelp group pride inc treadwell was convicted in 1983 of 
misusing funds in connection with a real estate spinoff of pride 
it was barrys high profile as an antiestablishment activist 
that propelled him into local politics first as a member of the 
board of education and then in 1974 as a member of the first 
elected city council organized under the home rule legislation 
he suffered his first personal crisis in 1977 when he was 
wounded by a shotgun blast in the hanafi muslim takeover of the 
district building the districts city hall a young reporter was 
killed 
in 1978 he defeated incumbent mayor walter washington in the 
citys democratic mayoral primary and went on to easily win the 
general election taking over a government he had railed against 
only a decade before 
i want to take the boards off of houses and put people in 
them i want to provide minimal care for all people regardless of 
their financial situation and i want to live out dr martin 
luther kings legacy of peace brotherhood and survival he said 
shortly after being sworn in 
his tenure has been noted for extensive downtown office and 
hotel development a soaring murder rate among young drug users 
and critics charge deterioration of services like housing despite 
the largest city bureaucracy in the country on a percapita basis 
his troubles began shortly after his first reelection in 1982 
with the first of federal investigations he termed attempts to 
lynch black people another way 
in 1984 karen johnson a convicted cocaine dealer with whom 
barry admitted having a personal relationship served 11 months 
in jail on contempt of court charges rather than tell investigators 
whether she used drugs with or sold them to the mayor 
the current round of investigation was touched off in december 
1988 when barry repeatedly visited the hotel room of a suspected 
drug dealer that man charles lewis was later convicted of 
cocaine charges in the virgin islands and has pleaded guilty to a 
drug conspiracy count in washington there have been recent news 
reports that lewis had told prosecutors he had provided drugs to 
the mayor

the government tried thursday to intimidate 
witnesses who testified for one of manuel noriegas codefendents 
by threatening them with immigration agents who questioned their 
legal status a defense attorney charged 
the agents demanded that three witnesses who testified for luis 
del cid on tuesday turn over all their immigration papers and give 
information about how they obtained passports into the united 
states said samuel burstyn del cids attorney 
burstyn filed a motion late thursday asking us district judge 
william hoeveler to order the government to refrain from contacting 
defense witnesses without their permission 
burstyn told the associated press that he hoped to hear friday 
morning when hoeveler would grant a hearing on his emergency 
motion the us attorneys office had no immediate comment 
earlier thursday defense attorneys accused the government of 
balking at court orders to turn over both secret and nonsecret 
documents to aid the defense in the case against noriega and his 
codefendants 
and a lawyer for convicted drug kingpin carlos lehder rivas 
strongly denied his client will cooperate with the government to 
convict the deposed panamanian leader despite a taped interview 
the imprisoned trafficker gave implicating noriega 
on wednesday hoeveler announced a march 5 trial date for 
noriega and the other defendants after burstyn demanded his 
clients right to a speedy trial 
burstyn said he hoped the date far earlier than the nine 
months to two years most attorneys had anticipated would force 
the government to cease dragging its feet on documents 
there is a desire to stonewall information burstyn said 
its an effort to hermetically seal off the guts and gore of the 
early investigation 
he emphasized he has not yet requested cia or other sensitive 
records only routine matters such as the prior criminal record of 
floyd carlton carceres the former noriega pilot whose testimony 
helped bring about the february 1988 drugtrafficking indictment 
us attorneys office spokeswoman diane cossin refused to 
comment beyond saying defense attorneys should do as instructed 
and not try this case in the media 
one attorney who has unsuccessfully sought secret material is 
michael okane lawyer for accused drug pilot daniel miranda when 
he requested information from a national security agency listening 
post in panama city prosecutors threatened to try him just for 
revealing its existence 
i tend to think that a lot of this case is going to go away 
because i dont think that a lot of the intelligence agencies want 
to reveal things okane said 
he said noriega was a cia asset since at least the 1960s and 
noted the case of cia agent joe fernandez whose indictment in the 
irancontra affair was eventually dropped because the government 
feared the trial would reveal too many secrets 
joe fernandezs case had to be dismissed and joe fernandez 
was a pipsqueak compared to noriega okane said 
the lawyer said that from the reaction of the us attorneys 
office to requests for information he suspected the prosecturs 
were not receiving cooperation from washington agencies 
i dont think anyone is telling them just what the situation 
is he said 
speculation that the government may have the help of testimony 
from convicted medellin cartel trafficker lehder was dismissed by 
lehders attorney jose quinon 
in a prison interview with the west german magazine stern 
recorded in november and broadcast wednesday on nbc news lehder 
said he had paid noriega several million dollars for protection 
lehder also said noriega confiscated drugs and processing 
equipment then sold it to drug dealers in colombia panama and the 
united states 
quinon said thursday that the interview was lehders idea and 
was no indication he planned to cooperate with prosecutors trying 
noriega 
he will be no witness against noriega there is no deal 
theres no cooperation with the government quinon said 
the us attorneys office spokeswoman ms cossin said she 
could not reveal the names of witnesses

it began as the nations largest child abuse case and ended as 
the nations longest trial in the six years between the mcmartin 
preschool case helped incite a revolution in the way society 
treats its youngest victims 
it was august 1983 when a woman named judy johnson called the 
police in manhattan beach calif to say that her son had a red 
bottom and was talking about a man named ray ray worked at the 
mcmartin preschool 
what followed was a nightmare a legal case that became too 
long too cumbersome too expensive and too traumatic it ended 
thursday with the jury acquitting the defendants of 52 charges and 
declaring themselves hopelessly deadlocked on the remaining 13 
regardless of the outcome experts say the case has led to 
fundamental changes in the way society looks at child abuse 
mcmartin made it evident to everyone working with kids and the 
legal system that there had to be some changes said nancy 
peterson a spokeswoman for the chicagobased national committee 
for prevention of child abuse 
i think that its safe to say that it has influenced a great 
deal of reform on behalf of kids 
some of those reforms have been in the regulation of child care 
many states now require background checks including fingerprints 
for all child care workers 
there also is a growing emphasis on training so that teachers 
and child care workers as well as parents and children know how 
to recognize the signs of sexual abuse 
the unfortunate legacy of mcmartin may be the suspicion it cast 
on an overwhelmingly innocent group of people the adults who care 
for children in daycare centers and nursery schools 
a study by the american association for protecting children 
showed that about 65 percent of child abuse cases involved an older 
relative of the child and only about 5 percent involved baby 
sitters or child care workers 
other studies have shown the percentage of sexual abuse cases 
involving child care workers to be as low as half of 1 percent 
its hard to say just how many of the changes in child care 
legislation can be traced to the mcmartin case 
interest in child care had been rising as more women entered the 
workplace and there have been other notorious child abuse cases 
in one of the most recent seven people in edenton nc were 
charged with sexually abusing at least 70 children at a daycare 
center 
so the argument can be made that mcmartin was only one of many 
influences and that change would have occurred anyway 
the mcmartin case was the first one to gain national 
notoriety im not sure still though that it had that much of an 
impact said katie bond of the denverbased american association 
for protecting children 
others say its influence has been profound 
first and foremost there has been an enormous increase in 
awareness of abuse of children under the age of 6 that is a 
whole domain that didnt exist prior to mcmartin really said 
david finklehor codirector of the family research laboratory at 
the university of new hampshire 
secondly theres been quite a revolution in the investigation 
and handling of sexual abuse cases in the criminal justice system 
and that can be traced to mcmartin 
for instance investigators prosecutors and judges are now 
frequently trained to deal with the victims of child abuse and 
some prosecutors employ counselors and other specialists to assist 
them 
in the mcmartin case hundreds of children initially told 
investigators that they had been sexually abused but many of their 
accounts were later disregarded as false responses to leading 
questions 
prosecutors were forced to whittle down their case from hundreds 
of charges against seven defendants to 65 charges against two 
defendants 
investigators since have been taught to be less leading more 
objective and to avoid even the appearance of rewarding the 
children for being forthcoming finklehor said 
courtroom procedures in some places have been tailored to the 
very young so they arent intimidated by formality or legalese in 
some cases children are allowed to sit on a parents lap while 
testifying 
some changes have been controversial the us supreme court 
ruled in 1988 that an iowa man was improperly convicted of sexual 
assault because he wasnt allowed to face his 13yearold accusers 
they testified with a screen blocking their view of the defendant 
this week the court agreed to review two more sexual abuse

life expectancies are improving for aids patients 
diagnosed with a certain type of pneumonia raising hope that the 
once uniformly fatal disease is becoming a chronic manageable 
one researchers say 
two studies published in todays journal of the american medical 
association indicate adults initially diagnosed with aids and with 
a pneumonia known as pcp are surviving significantly longer than 
they did in the early 1980s 
pcp or pneumocystis carinii pneumonia is the most common 
aidsrelated infection and has been considered one of the most 
quickly fatal diseases that can overwhelm the damaged immune 
systems of people with aids 
the data in these reports appear to confirm what clinicians 
investigators and patients have known for several years life 
after aids is improving and death is no longer as swift and as 
certain as in the early years of the epidemic said an editorial 
accompanying the studies 
but the dramatic improvement in twoyear aids survival hasnt 
been matched by a corresponding improvement in fiveyear survival 
which remains low said the editorial by dr richard e chaisson of 
the johns hopkins school of medicine in baltimore 
new antibiotics to prevent pcp in aids patients and the highly 
successful antiaids drug zidovudine formerly called azt have 
produced hope that aids has become a chronic manageable 
disease chaisson wrote 
his editorial accompanied a san francisco study of 4323 aids 
patients that found those who were diagnosed in 1982 and who 
initially had pcp survived a median of 103 months five years 
later that figure had risen to 179 months researchers said 
but survival worsened over the same period among aids patients 
initially diagnosed with a type of skin cancer called kaposis 
sarcoma a common sign of aids survival declined from a median of 
339 months to a median of 18 months the researchers said 
the finding may have resulted from a declining proportion of 
aids patients with ks patients who are relatively healthy 
compared with pneumonia patients reflecting a shift toward more 
aggressive forms of aids the researchers said 
among patients diagnosed with other opportunistic infections or 
malignancies survival remained the same the researchers said 
for 644 patients treated with zidovudine in the san francisco 
study the drug was a significant predictor of survival said 
the researchers led by george h lemp of the citys department of 
public health 
zidovudine was released for widespread use in 1986 
overall in the seven years of the san francisco study the 
median survival of aids patients was 125 months and fiveyear 
survival was 34 percent said the authors 
the other study published in todays journal looked at adults 
nationwide who were diagnosed with acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome in the years 1984 through 1987 and in whom pcp was an 
early sign of the disease 
in patients diagnosed in 1984 and 1985 just 427 percent 
survived a year the researchers said by 1986 and 1987 the 
oneyear survival rate had risen to 545 percent 
the gain in survival was observed in homosexual men and 
intravenous drug users of both sexes in all age and racial groups 
in all geographic regions and in patients with or without other 
diseases at the time said the studys author dr jeffrey e 
harris of massachusetts general hospital in boston 
better diagnosis and treatment particularly the introduction 
of zidovudine may have contributed to the decline in mortality

most of the 30 million americans who have genital 
herpes probably will never know they are infected researchers 
believe and a new study indicates that women without symptoms can 
easily spread the disease 
in the study 27 women with genital herpes simplex virus 
infections that produced recurrent sores underwent daily home tests 
to detect whether they were giving off the virus even when they 
didnt have sores 
though such viral shedding in the absence of symptoms has 
been detected in previous studies of women with genital herpes 
never before has a study tried to determine how often it occurs 
authors of the study said 
subjects selftested themselves at home at least three times a 
week for three weeks and the tests revealed that seven were giving 
off virus the researchers said the shedding occurred during 1 
percent of the total days on which home tests were performed the 
researchers reported 
these data suggest that all women with recurrent genital 
herpes simplex virus infection should be instructed about the 
possible risk albeit infrequent of asymptomatically shedding 
virus from the genital tract the authors said in todays journal 
of the american medical association 
men also can spread the virus in the absence of sores previous 
studies have shown 
all women who underwent the home test on more than 100 days were 
found to be shedding virus on at least one occasion and the same 
was true of 80 percent of women who underwent tests on more than 50 
days the researchers said 
the researchers said if tested frequently probably all 
women with recurrent genital hsv infection would shed the virus 
even if they didnt have sores 
shedding was not related to age contraceptive practices or 
frequency of recurrence of genital sores the researchers said 
nor did it occur more often in any one location on the genitals 
said the researchers led by brigit v brock and dr lawrence corey 
of the university of washington at seattle 
whats new is that they the researchers looked at the sites 
of shedding in women said dr stephen straus head of medical 
virology at the national institute of allergy and infectious 
diseases in bethesda md 
and they looked a little better than those who had done so 
previously in terms of how long you have to test a person before 
you find it he said in a telephone interview thursday 
genital herpes an incurable and lifelong infection that is 
spread through sexual contact lies dormant most of the time but 
can erupt in painful sores or blisters 
existing data suggest that about twothirds of people who have 
been infected never know it straus said when they transmit 
it that is of course asymptomatic 
genital herpes is usually mild in adults but each year 250 to 
500 us babies are born with severe herpes simplex 2 infections 
they inherit from a parent straus said some of the babies have 
severe developmental problems he said

mayor marion barry his last years in office 
tarnished by accusations of drug use was arrested on a narcotics 
charge thursday night in what federal authorities described as an 
ongoing public corruption probe 
a federal law enforcement source said authorities had a 
videotape of barry smoking cocaine 
barrys arrest at a downtown hotel came just three days before 
the mayor planned to formally announce that he would seek 
reelection to a fourth term and a day before longtime barry 
associate charles lewis was scheduled for sentencing on drug 
charges 
lewis testified in federal court that he provided cocaine for 
the mayor but it was not clear whether thursday nights arrest was 
connected to the lewis investigation 
barry has steadfastly denied that he used drugs 
the law enforcement source who spoke on condition he not be 
identified said the probe was designed to catch barry with an 
illegal drug and that authorities had barry on film 
the source said cocaine was seized from the hotel room but that 
specific charges would not be lodged until the substance could be 
analyzed he said enough cocaine was seized to charge the mayor 
with possession for personal use 
the us attorneys office said barry would appear before a 
federal magistrate for arraignment on drug charges friday 
a second federal law enforcement source said the arrest was the 
result of as sting operation in which fbi agents observed a 
prearranged meeting between the mayor and an unidentified friend in 
a downtown hotel the vista international about six blocks from 
the white house 
the undercover operation which had been in place for several 
weeks involved setting up film equipment to photograph and record 
the mayor in the hotel room sources said 
barry 53 was arrested at the hotel shortly after 8 pm as a 
result of an undercover operation conducted jointly by the city 
police departments internal affairs division and the fbi 
according to a statement by us attorney jay stephens and thomas 
duhadway special agent in charge of the fbis washington office 
there was no word of additional arrests 
city police officers barred access to upper floors of the hotel 
to all but guests a dozen or so teenagers mixed with reporters 
discussing the arrest outside 
a city official who asked not to be identified said barry had no 
events on his schedule at the hotel thursday night 
first word of the arrest was broadcast shortly after 10 pm by 
television station wrc which said the mayor attempted to buy 
cocaine on the seventh floor 
the mayor the citys second under home rule was led away by 
undercover police officers and fbi agents the station said and 
his driver and bodyguard were led away separately 
barry was taken to the fbis national headquarters said federal 
sources who asked not to be identified he returned to his home in 
the southeast section of the city after midnight accompanied by 
fbi agents and herbert o reid a longtime adviser and the citys 
attorney 
barry who has repeatedly won reelection with large majorities 
has lost support over the past four years because of allegations of 
drug use and corruption convictions against several members of his 
administration 
jesse jackson fueled speculation that he would challenge barry 
when he moved to washington last year however jackson has said 
repeatedly that he would not challenge barry jackson said through 
a spokesman he would have no comment on the arrest 
drug use among the citys young men is blamed for a sharply 
rising murder rate a record 438 homicides were committed last 
year against 369 the year before 
top city officials were meeting late thursday night to assess 
the arrest city council chairman david clarke who is running for 
mayor called the arrest a tragic moment in our citys history 
councilwoman charlene jarvis another mayoral candidate said the 
arrest changes the political landscape of the city 
although rumors about barry and drugs had surfaced throughout 
the last half of his tenure as mayor no charges had been brought 
before thursday 
the accusations became even more widespread after the arrest of 
lewis 
barry was visiting lewis hotel room in december 1988 when city 
police were sent to investigate a report that lewis was selling 
drugs when the officers found out barry was present they 
abandoned their mission in an episode not yet fully explained 
lewis pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute 
cocaine in washington and was scheduled to be sentenced on that 
charge friday lewis also has been convicted of selling drugs in 
the virgin islands 
in november wusatv said a local physician had reported to 
police that barry had been treated for a drug overdose in 1983 the 
thenpolice chief later reported that investigators were unable to 
confirm that report 
karen johnson a former city worker with whom barry eventually 
admitted a romance was convicted on various drug charges in 1984 
she served several months in prison for refusing to testify about 
barry

a japanese legislator who wrote a book sharply 
critical of american attitudes toward japan shrugs off the 
controversy it is stirring up in the united states 
americans may be unhappy shintaro ishihara says but the 
controversy has been great for sales in japan already 500000 
copies of a japan that can say no have been snatched up and 
he predicted sales will hit 1 million by spring 
in an interview thursday during a trip to washington to try to 
calm outraged us policymakers ishihara rejected a suggestion 
that his nationalistic views were out of the mainstream of japanese 
public opinion 
i have many letters from my readers he said many of them 
are saying how come americans get mad at those things that are so 
ordinary that i read in your book 
while no authorized version of ishiharas book exists in the 
united states copying machines on capitol hill have been working 
overtime to reproduce translations done by us intelligence and 
defense agencies 
portions of the book have even found their way into the 
congressional record as congressional critics of japans trade 
policies rushed to publicize what they say is a prime example of 
japans arrogance in economic matters 
in the book ishihara argues that japan needs to be more 
assertive in standing up to america he brags about japans 
technological superiority and calls americas military shield for 
japan an illusion he complains that americans behave more like 
mad dogs than watch dogs and he dismisses american criticism of 
japan as being racially motivated 
in the part of the book that attracted the pentagons attention 
he warns that unless america reforms its policies toward japan 
tokyo might stop supplying the microchips needed to accurately 
target us nuclear missiles 
ishihara writes that japan could sell the chips to the soviets 
instead in an action which would instantly change the balance of 
military power 
in an interview with the associated press ishihara did not 
recant any of his comments but he maintained that the pirated 
version now in circulation in washington leaves out certain 
clarifying comments 
he said he was working to bring out an authorized 
englishlanguage version of the book by april although it will 
lack the contributions of his japanese coauthor sony corp 
chairman akio morita 
morita who wrote several less inflammatory chapters of the 
japanese book now says he regrets his involvement with the project 
ishihara said he intended for the book to stimulate an honest 
dialogue between us and japanese policymakers at a time when 
relationships between the two countries are in transition 
we have come to a new era where a redefinition of the 
usjapan relationship is called for he said 
he said he hoped to arrange a series of debates between members 
of the japanese parliament and the us congress after the upcoming 
parliamentary elections in february 
with japan accounting for almost half of americas 111 billion 
annual trade deficit efforts to stem the flow of japanese imports 
and boost us export sales are a prime topic in congress with 
various lawmakers urging retaliation against japanese imports 
unless the country buys more american products 
ishihara a member of the conservative liberaldemocratic party 
was considered one of the frontrunners last year for the prime 
ministers job which eventually went to toshiki kaifu 
rep sander levin dmich met with ishihara and said afterward 
he was not optimistic there will be any quick resolution to the 
trade problems separating the two countries 
he called ishiharas views a minority point of view but one 
which american policymakers need to take seriously and respond to 
it

us warships off the coasts of colombia are 
unwanted and unneeded in the fight against drugs says the 
ambassador from that country 
i dont think that the sending of vessels or troops to our 
waters is necessary colombian ambassador victor mosquera chaux 
said thursday i think us naval forces could begin by trying to 
control the entry of narcotics within their own waters 
i dont understand why theres so much insistence on military 
operations when the colombian military and police forces have shown 
their capabilities he said at a press conference 
ambassador cesar atala nazal of peru also said his country would 
not accept us troops for drug fighting within the country or us 
vessels in waters offshore because they are not necessary at 
all 
but atala dd not rule out limited use of us ships and planes 
for radar surveillance and aerial tracking 
what we object to is unilateral decisions made by the united 
states affecting the internal affairs of our country he said 
we would like to see what the points are what the arguments 
are what the benefits would be and you can be sure that the 
peruvian government will be absolutely understanding of the 
arguments presented by the united states government and eventually 
reach an agreement he said 
defense department sources said last week that the aircraft 
carrier uss john f kennedy has been chosen to lead an interdiction 
effort off the caribbean coast of colombia but that no final 
decision had been made on deployment 
word of the proposed deployment touched off rumors that the 
united states might try to blockade colombia and there was outrage 
from latin american nations that were still angry over the us 
invasion of panama 
atala mosquera and bolivian ambassador jorge crespo velasco 
appeared at the news conference after testifying before a joint 
hearing of the senate judiciary committee and the senate caucus on 
international narcotics 
judiciary committee chairman joseph r biden jr ddel has 
proposed to offer south american countries debt relief in exchange 
for concrete activity against the drug trade 
biden said he hoped the idea would appear on the agenda when the 
leaders of the three countries and the united states hold their 
drug summit in colombia feb 15 
peruvian president alan garcia has said he will not attend the 
meeting unless all the us invasion forces are out of panama 
biden expressed interest in a proposal by perus atala and 
endorsed by bolivias crespo for the us to help purchase the coca 
leaf crop for a few years while farmers turn to other crops 
atala said peruvian farmers would dream to be on the side of 
the law even if it meant earning slightly less from other crops 
payments to the farmers about 234 million for one years worth 
of crops would find their way into the economy as well atala 
said at the hearing noting that last years drugfighting aid 
totaled 254 million 
i am absolutely convinced that the farmers themselves would 
profit by getting this money but working within the law rather than 
continue being the victims of traffickers the terrorists and the 
peruvian police he said

up to 400000 soviets may be asking to enter 
the united states as refugees in the coming years but at most only 
10000 will be allowed in this fiscal year an immigration official 
says 
the rest will have to wait despite some signs they may be in 
danger of intimidation by soviet authorities the nations top 
immigration official said thursday 
under an agreement between the administration and congress 
50000 soviet refugees will be allowed into the united states in 
the 1990 fiscal year that began oct 1 but 40000 to 45000 of 
those slots will be used up by a backlog of soviets waiting since 
last year in transit in italy said gene mcnary commissioner of 
the immigration and naturalization service 
the rome channel was shut off by the bush administration last 
oct 1 under a new system that only allows soviets to apply in 
moscow but attorney general dick thornburgh pledged to clear up 
the backlog in rome before closing down the transit facility 
as many as 100000 other applicants most of them jews are 
waiting in moscow mcnary told reporters the ins has provided 
300000 additional application forms 
based on talks and impressions from a trip to moscow last week 
mcnary said it was difficult to determine whether applicants were 
in danger of intimidation by soviet authorities 
by and large people are free to come to the us embassy and 
present their applications as evidenced by the long lines outside 
the building mcnary said but there are situations which would 
indicate a wellfounded fear of persecution 
the estimated 25 million jews in the soviet union were for many 
years subject to officially sanctioned antisemitism banned from 
practicing their religion and studying their language and history 
the liberalized soviet administration of president mikhail s 
gorbachev has banned antisemitism and lifted most restrictions on 
the emigration of jews and evangelical christians and armenians 
but a state department report several months ago found that 
antisemitism among newly emerging nationalist groups has risen 
after years of demanding that the kremlin allow more soviets to 
leave the united states now faces severe budget limits and more 
soviets seeking to enter the country than it can take in 
more than 71000 jews left the soviet union last year the 
highest annual rate ever and 36147 of them came to the united 
states as refugees refugee status means the federal government 
pays for their travel and resettlement here and recipients are 
eligible to become citizens 
mcnary said he expects a possible increase in the number of 
armenians seeking refugee or asylum status in the united states as 
a result of the violence against them in the soviet republic of 
azerbaijan dozens of armenians have been killed in the fighting 
which has escalated in recent days to civil war proportions 
as many as 2000 armenians could be allowed into the united 
states each month under a category known as humanitarian parole 
which entitles them to some federal assistance but not to automatic 
citizenship about 12000 armenians came here last year 
mcnary said the ins has increased its staff in moscow to 24 and 
has begun operating an office in suburban washington to help in 
processing the soviet applications 
mcnary also said the ins had received 3720 applications from 
chinese studying or working in the united states seeking permission 
to stay here in light of the repression against the prodemocracy 
movement in china most of the applications have been approved he 
said

concern about asbestos in schools and public 
buildings may be overstated suggests a group of researchers who 
say there is little data showing that asbestos levels in such 
buildings are a health hazard 
the report by a group of scientists as reported in science 
magazine said that although most of the health concerns from 
asbestos stem from studies involving occupational exposure there 
is no data to show similar risks to the general public exposed to 
airborne asbestos 
surveys of asbestos in schools and public buildings show that 
the mean airborne concentrations are several thousand times lower 
than in workplace environments that existed before asbestos was 
strictly regulated said the study 
asbestos once widely used for insulation and other purposes 
has been shown to cause lung cancer asbestosis a scarring of the 
lung and mesothelioma a cancer of the chest and abdomen the 
federal government has directed that schools inspect for asbestos 
and develop plans to have it removed or enclosed so occupants will 
not be exposed to airborne particles 
the researchers three from the united states one from 
scotland and one from france argue that most of the studies on 
asbestos have involved asbestos miners and other workers routinely 
exposed to the cancercausing materal in the workplace 
an important issue is whether these diseases are also hazards 
to the general population exposed to airborne levels of asbestos in 
schools and other buildings said the researchers 
the findings noted there are different forms of asbestos and 
that each poses different health risks 
the available data said the report do not indicate that 
asbestosassociated malignancies or functional impairment will 
occur as a result of exposure to most airborne concentrations of 
asbestos in buildings 
the scientists said that even when asbestoscontaining materials 
in buildings are damaged the levels of airborne asbestos normally 
found are magnitudes lower than concentrations in the unregulated 
workplace in the past 
airborne asbestos levels found in schools and buildings normally 
are no more than 1 percent of levels considered today to be 
permissible in the workplace by the occupational safety and health 
administration the scientists said 
furthermore said the scientists with few exceptions the type 
of asbestos fiber found predominantly in buildings is chrysotile 
accumulating evidence indicates that this asbestos type is probably 
not associated with the occurrence of mesotheliomas at low levels 
of exposure 
the scientists said the rate of deaths from mesothelioma over 
the past 10 to 20 years has been increasing among males over 65 
years of age that have a past occupational history of exposure to 
asbestos but similar rates among females of all ages have declined 
or remained constant 
these results support the concept that asbestos in buildings 
is not an important risk factor as one would expect increased 
mesotheliomas in both males and females said the study 
the findings were authored by bt mossman of the university of 
vermont college of medicine j bignon a leading french medical 
researcher m corn of johns hopkins university a seaton 
director of the institute of occupational medicine in edinburgh 
scotland and jbl gee of yale university school of medicine

us intelligence officials have long known 
manuel antonio noriega was once relieved of his duties for 
mistreating prisoners and was restricted to quarters as a junior 
officer for drunk and disorderly conduct documents show 
the documents released by the defense intelligence agency in 
response to a freedom of information act request provide details 
of noriegas rise through the panamanian military starting with 
his education in peru and venezuela before 1962 
but many details in the biographical reports were blacked out to 
prevent public scrutiny 
noriega who previously had helped us intelligence agencies 
was ousted as panamas dictator in the invasion by us troops last 
month he is jailed in miami on charges of drug trafficking 
the dia documents show noriega was in trouble with the 
panamanian national guard less than a year after he entered the 
service on may 26 1962 
thirty days restriction to quarters for drunk and disorderly 
conduct jan 1963 reads one item written when noriega was a 
second lieutenant assigned to colon 
after a stint in the traffic section in the town of david 
noriega was put in charge of a detachment in the bocas del toro 
province on march 11 1964 
less than a month later he encountered another problem 
temporarily relieved of duties for mistreatment of prisoners 
413 apr 1964 the documents say 
but noriega returned to david to head the traffic section in 
april 1964 and his association with the united states apparently 
started the next year 
in 1965 noriega was selected to attend the jungle operations 
course at the us army school of the americas at fort gulick in 
the canal zone 
the school now at fort benning ga is considered a 
prestigious assignment for upandcoming latin american military 
officers according to maj jack rail a spokesman foreign nations 
select the people they want to attend he said 
rail said the schools records also show noriega attending the 
school in 1967 
before he was promoted to major noriega worked briefly as a 
public relations officer 
he then moved into intelligence work serving as a member of the 
counterintelligence and counterespionage organization in 19691970 
he also served as a member of an arms purchasing commission that 
visited france israel and possibly england in july 1970 
from 1970 until 1981 noriega was the assistant chief of g2 
the intelligence unit he was made a brigadier general on aug 1 
1983 
other dia documents reveal that us officials kept superiors 
apprised of current information noriega 
quoting the weekly newspaper quiubo a dia report said noriega 
was said to have received death threats from colombian drug lords 
because he was cooperating with us drug enforcement agents 
noriega reportedly moved his headquarters to a super 
protected bunker with extremely limited access on the small 
island of naos alongside a causeway the dia report said in april 
1986 
the documents provide only a few personal details such as 
noriegas birthday on feb 11 1936 
the report notes noriega is a nonpracticing roman catholic 
and is possibly a follower of the rosicrucians and has studied 
buddhism 
rosicrucians are followers of a group of 18th century 
philosophers who claimed to have been deeply versed in the secrets 
of nature 
when noriegas quarters were raided by us troops in december 
american officials said they found items of voodoo apparatus

antiabortion members of congress can regain 
some of the favor theyve lost with prochoice voters by supporting 
a 175 billion child care package according to a child welfare 
group 
here is an opportunity for candidates including those 
moderate republicans who may be antichoice to be prowomen to be 
profamily marian wright edelman president of the childrens 
defense fund said thursday 
parents overwhelmingly say they need it in an election 
year its going to be hard for any candidate to vote against it 
said mrs edelman 
the senate approved child care legislation last year by a 6337 
margin despite fierce opposition from the bush administration and 
the senate gop leadership 
but the package was derailed in the house after democratic 
leaders failed to resolve a dispute among members of their own 
party over spending levels 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash has pledged to make the 
legislation a priority when congress returns next week public 
opinion polls indicate a large majority of americans favor federal 
aid for child care 
the childrens defense fund supports a compromise worked out 
last fall between sens christopher dodd dconn and orrin hatch 
rutah and rep augustus hawkins dcalif 
the compromise would authorize an increase of 11 billion to 
states for child care services much of it in reimbursements to 
low and moderateincome families 
it would also provide about 215 million for head start 
preschool programs and 435 million for public schools so halfday 
child care programs could be expanded into allday centers 
the measure would be funded through the annual appropriations 
process congress last year included 12 billion for the new 
program but it was stripped from the budget when lawmakers failed 
to complete action on the authorization bill 
a competing version by democratic reps tom downey of new york 
and george miller of california offers an initial 200 million 
through an expansion of block grant entitlements to states with 
the level increasing to 400 million in later years 
because those are entitlements congress would not have to 
approve the funds each year 
a key difference in the plans is an increase in tax credits for 
working families thats included in the downeymiller version 
though supporters of the other plan have indicated they are willing 
to include similar provisions 
the projected tax credit for 1991 adjusted for inflation is 
expected to be about 1000 the credit would be increased under 
the downeymiller plan to 1220 for families with one child 
1500 for families with two children and 1790 for three or more 
children 
it would also create a supplemental tax credit for families with 
children under age 6 that credit would be about 430 in 1991 
the tax credits would provide about 135 billion over five 
years according to the house ways and means staff

president bush wants to add 18 billion next 
year to the governments international affairs spending enough to 
retain current aid to israel and boost assistance for eastern 
europe congressional sources say 
bush will propose increasing this years 166 billion in 
outlays for foreign aid and other international operations to about 
184 billion for fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 the proposal 
will be included in the 1991 budget the president submits to 
congress on jan 29 the sources said 
spending on international affairs includes foreign aid the 
budgets of the state department and us information agency and 
participation in international organizations such as the united 
nations 
it is a part of the budget that was frequently cut during the 
reagan administration years it remains highly unpopular with many 
members of congress who prefer to spend federal money on domestic 
programs and the increase could be difficult to win from lawmakers 
it will be tough said john sewell president of the 
overseas development council a private think tank in washington 
but were reaching the point where there are two options start 
cutting those items that are already in there or start putting 
some new resources in 
according to the sources the increase would allow israel and 
egypt the two largest recipients of us foreign aid to avoid any 
cuts in their assistance israel gets 3 billion annually from the 
united states while egypt receives 21 billion 
on thursday israeli defense minister yitzhak rabin told 
reporters he has been assured that foreign aid to his country will 
not be cut next year 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan this week proposed 
cutting assistance to all countries including israel and egypt 
so it could be redistributed to countries in eastern europe and 
central america dole proposed a 5 percent cut in aid to each 
country which he said would free 400 million for emerging 
democracies 
when dole discussed his plan with reporters he said bush had 
been informed of his idea and that the president mustve agreed 
with it 
the boost would permit new assistance to eastern european and 
central american countries the sources said they said it also 
would allow the united states to pay the 700 million it owes the 
united nations for membership and peacekeeping expenses and to 
begin rebuilding a new embassy in moscow us officials believe 
the newly constructed embassy there is riddled with soviet 
listening devices 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said they were 
uncertain what assistance would be provided to the new 
usinstalled government of panama under the bush plan the 
administration is expected to seek aid for panama this fiscal year 
which runs through sept 30

a therapist defended her interviews of 
alleged victims in the mcmartin preschool molestation trial 
despite criticism by several jurors who said leading questions 
undermined the prosecutions case 
the jury on thursday acquitted raymond buckey and his mother 
peggy mcmartin buckey of 52 child molestation counts and 
deadlocked on 13 other counts 
therapist kee mcfarlane later defended her work with hundreds of 
mcmartin students and suggested that the goals of therapy are at 
odds with the legal standards required for a successful criminal 
prosecution 
what is in the interest of children is not always in the 
interest of the legal system she said 
evidence introduced by prosecutors in what became the longest 
and most expensive criminal trial in us history included 
videotaped interviews of the alleged victims 
many of the interviews were conducted at an early stage of the 
sexual abuse investigation by macfarlane a social worker and 
director of the child sexual abuse center at childrens institute 
international 
macfarlane said thursday she still believes children from the 
school had been molested and that they had not fabricated their 
accounts of abuse 
this agency would never have gone all the way through what we 
have if we did not believe these children she said 
at least seven jurors who attended a news conference agreed the 
evidence showed children had been molested but the jurors were 
sharply critical of the interviewers technique at the institute 
the children were never allowed to say in their own words what 
happened to them said juror john breese all the questions 
were leading 
if the cii tapes had not been entered into evidence and i had 
not seen them i could have believed the children a little more 
juror brenda williams said 
but macfarlane said that the interviewing techniques were sound 
noting that small children must be interviewed differently than 
adults 
i didnt put words into their mouths she said i tried to 
enable them to get over their fears 
macfarlane acknowledged that some procedures could have been 
done differently including conducting more interviews over a 
longer period of time she called the outcome of the case a 
tragic consequence of an attempt to prevent trauma to these 
children 
but the institutes executive director mary m emmons said 
some good may come out of the case 
it has greatly increased the awareness about the issue of 
child sexual abuse and about the problems of prosecuting these 
cases she said

first lady barbara bush is softening the 
qualified yes she gave when asked if military women should be 
allowed to serve in combat 
she said in a radio interview with mutual broadcasting on 
thursday that women are not physically strong enough to go into 
combat and their presence would cause morale and other problems 
that differed from what she told news agency reporters tuesday 
a qualified yes when she said 
if i thought a woman physically could pick up someone who was 
wounded and carry them to safety if i thought they could throw a 
hand grenade as far a man then i would say fine because i think 
certainly emotionally and mentally they are more than able to 
compete with a man 
im sure they can shoot as well they can fly as well she 
said in the earlier interview the only problem i would have 
would be if it risked somebody elses life because they couldnt 
throw a hand grenade as far or carry 
that answer put her at odds with pentagon policy which excludes 
women from combat roles however in the us invasion of panama 
some women unexpectedly found themselves getting shot at and 
shooting back 
mrs bush said thursday i wasnt clear in the earlier 
interview 
what i said was i dont think women are physically strong 
enough but its much more complicated than that theres a morale 
problem other problems 
i do not think a woman is as strong as a man if you endanger 
the lives of your buddies then that just automatically rules it 
out forgetting morale problems and other problems that are very 
important to the military

president bushs state of the union address 
will call for guaranteed preschool programs for disadvantaged 
children and requiring states to cut dropout rates in half by the 
end of the decade according to draft documents 
bush who has said he wants to be the education president 
and the nations governors agreed in september at an education 
summit to establish specific guidelines with timetables to 
improve learning in the nations schools 
they have been hurriedly working on a consensus in preparation 
for bushs state of the union on jan 31 and the national 
governors association meeting in february 
in a memo obtained thursday by the associated press bushs 
domestic policy adviser roger porter said specific objectives 
backing up the goals will be announced and approved during the feb 
2527 nga convention 
i believe that we have satisfied the criteria we set for 
ourselves of producing goals that are limited in number memorable 
measurable ambitious and yet realistic porter told govs bill 
clinton of arkansas and carroll campbell of south carolina in his 
memo 
these goals are ambitious yet they can and must be 
achieved said the draft memo however they cannot be achieved 
by our education system as presently constituted substantial even 
radical changes will have to be made 
according to the documents the national goals will focus on six 
key areas all targeting measurable progress to the year 2000 the 
areas are school readiness student achievement international 
performance high school completion adult literacy and lifelong 
learning and safe disciplined and drugfree schools 
specifics goals include 
making sure all disadvantaged 4yearolds have access to 
preschool programs that help prepare them for school and that they 
have the nutrition and health care needed to arrive at school 
healthy 
requiring each state to reduce its dropout rate by at least 
half on average and making sure that 75 percent of those students 
who drop out of school will successfully complete a high school 
degree or its equivalent 
cutting by at least half the gap in high school graduation 
rates between american students from minority backgrounds and their 
nonminority counterparts 
tripling the percentage of high school students who complete a 
rigorous curriculum including proficiency in english mathematics 
science history geography foreign languages and computer 
sciences 
increasing the number of qualified teachers in mathematics and 
science 
also to be recommended will be a national panel on education 
performance which will report annually on progress toward the 
goals overseeing development of new measures and revising goals 
and objectives if justified the document said 
the governors also are working with the administration and 
congress to develop more regulatory flexibility 
the final phase of the governments program accountability by 
the federal government the states and all in the education system 
will be developed over the next few months in time for the ngas 
annual meeting in july

a federal firearms official says the 
administration will consider whether to ban imports of 
semiautomatic assaultstyle pistols but says there arent that 
many coming into the country 
handgun control inc petitioned for a ban on pistol imports as 
semiautomatic assaultstyle rifle imports were barred last july 
contending the pistols are being imported in significant 
numbers 
the washington post also reported the treasury departments 
bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms approved a permit last fall 
for heckler amp koch of west germany to send 10000 of its sp89 
semiautomatic pistols into the united states 
i dont know where these numbers are coming from atf 
spokesman jack killorin said thursday the actual number of 
imports are not anywhere near the numbers being mentioned 
the atf cannot release specific import figures for the previous 
12 months because they are considered proprietary information said 
killorin but he provided general information on all the styles of 
semiautomatic assaultstyle pistols 
theres a total of several thousand that have been actually 
imported over a threeyear period he said without identifying 
it one of the firearms mentioned appears not to have been imported 
since 1987 the total quantity reported to have been imported into 
the united states is 50 
killorin said the atf studied the pistols last year when it 
reviewed imports of semiautomatic assaultstyle rifles including 
the popular ak47 model used by drifter patrick purdy to kill five 
children and wound 29 others and a teacher at a stockton calif 
elementary school jan 17 1989 
the atf in july banned imports of 43 types of semiautomatic 
assaultstyle rifles but decided to let the handgun imports 
continue he said 
we looked at them in line with the law and we approved the 
guns he said 
killorin said the agency would examine the issues raised by the 
handgun control petition filed wednesday he said he could not 
predict when the study would be completed 
the petition names five models the heckler amp koch and uzi 
pistols similar to rifles already banned the australian automatic 
arms sap pistol the fie spectre p pistol and the sterling mark 
7 pistol 
all of the factors which atf considered persuasive in banning 
the importation of semiautomatic assault rifles are present and 
applicable to semiautomatic assault pistols the petition said 
but killorin said banning the pistol imports would be much more 
difficult than banning the rifle imports although all firearms 
imports must meet the test that they be suitable for sporting 
purposes 
the handguns passed all the regulations in place since the gun 
control act of 1968 which focused on keeping out cheap saturday 
night specials he said the rifles represented a relatively new 
technology not covered by extensive legislative history that 
centered on handguns and therefore the atf had more leeway to ban 
them he said 
the object of what we do is to fairly and reasonably enforce 
the law and to reasonably interpret what the law means through 
regulation killorin said 
what we cannot do is we cannot through regulation rewrite 
the law he said the writing and passing of laws is the 
business of elected officials the president and congress

a new congressional study estimates less than 
10 percent of president bushs proposed capital gains tax cut would 
go to occasional investors including those who once in a lifetime 
sell a family farm or business 
more than 81 percent of the benefit would be reaped by those who 
are likely to report capital gains in three or more of every five 
years according to an analysis by the staff of the joint committee 
on taxation 
rep byron l dorgan dnd a house ways and means committee 
member who opposes a capital gains cut said the report explodes 
the myth perpetrated by president bush that his proposal is a tax 
cut for middleincome families and designed to help those who sell 
a farm or business theyve held for 20 years 
mark bloomfield executive director of the american council for 
capital formation a business group that supports a capital gains 
cut said the study does not refute arguments for a reduction 
our point is that there are middleclass people who 
periodically do realize capital gains and the tax system considers 
them rich every year by the way it taxes them bloomfield said 
that is not right 
the new analysis of internal revenue service data found 589 
percent of capital gains recorded in a fiveyear period were 
reported by people who had gains every year more than 81 percent 
of the profits were reported by taxpayers who had gains in at least 
three of the five years 
by contrast 98 percent of the gains were collected by those 
who reported gains in only one of the five years including those 
whose only capital gains were profits from the sale of a home farm 
or business 
among taxpayers who realized gains in the period 1979 through 
1983 a substantial number of taxpayers 437 percent realized 
onetime or nonrecurring gains the committee staff concluded 
however in dollar value the bulk of realizations were 
undertaken by taxpayers who were repeatedly in the market 
the analysis seeks to answer the question of who would actually 
benefit from cutting the tax on capital gains which are profits 
from the sale of stock and other investments 
democrats cite estimates that 80 percent of the benefit would go 
to those with total incomes more than 100000 a year republicans 
say it is misleading to list someone as having an over100000 
income when a person for instance earns 30000 a year but sells 
a family business for a 100000 profit 
bush who will renew his call for a capital gains reduction in 
the budget he sends to congress jan 29 criticized opponents of 
the cut in a speech earlier this month i am sick and tired of 
the demagogues who call this a tax cut for the rich it means jobs 
it means savings and it is good for all americans he said 
the congressional study found people with noncapital gains 
income under 20000 filed 28 percent of the returns on which gains 
were reported but had only 20 percent of the dollar value of the 
gains even the 20 percent figure was distorted the report stated 
because it included people whose taxable incomes were less than 
zero due to a business or farm loss or a tax shelter 
since enactment of the 1986 landmark tax overhaul capital gains 
have been fully taxed at the same rates that apply to other income 
bush wants to exclude as much as 30 percent of capital gains from 
taxation which would mean such profits would be taxed at lower 
rates than apply to wages 
the house over objections of democratic leaders approved a 
reduction last year in the capital gains tax democratic leaders 
blocked a cut in the senate although a majority of senators 
favored it

a democratic womens political organization 
says its survey shows 1990 should be a strong year for women who 
run for public office and take a liberal position on abortion 
the survey released thursday by emilys list shows prochoice 
candidates would be generally favored over antiabortion 
candidates if all other circumstances in the elections were equal 
the survey showed the biggest advantage for those favoring 
liberal stances on abortion would be in when a hypothetical 
prochoice democratic married woman is matched against a 
prolife republican married man the findings showed a 12point 
advantage for the woman in such a contest the widest spread of any 
of the combinations used in the poll 
emilys list president ellen malcolm called the results a key 
to electing more democratic women which is not an easy task 
the poll said that when marital status and sex were not 
specified prochoice democrats would have a 10point advantage 
over prolife republicans emilys list said it used the terms 
prochoice and prolife in the survey because of the strong 
images they present and because of the likelihood that candidates 
would use one of the terms to describe themselves 
the survey was designed to single out the impact of the abortion 
issue on elections and so the only information given to respondents 
about hypothetical candidates was their position on abortion party 
affiliation sex and marital status 
emilys list is a political network founded in 1985 that 
raises money and identifies political opportunities for democratic 
women its name is an acronym for early money is like yeast 
that is it makes the dough rise 
release of the groups survey coincided with a meeting of the 
national republican committee the gop debate over the abortion 
issue was highlighted thursday when a member who tried to introduce 
a resolution reaffirming the party stand against abortion was told 
he was out of order 
republican national chairman lee atwater was expected to 
dedicate a good portion of his speech at todays session to how 
candidates should handle the issue 
democratic candidates who took strong prochoice stands won 
statewide races in virginia and new jersey in 1989 and republican 
leaders said they would try to recapture disaffected voters by 
saying the gop was a big tent with room for both views 
but that stance has alienated some conservatives who applauded 
the partys strong platform position and president bushs vetoes 
last year of bills over abortion provisions 
the emilys list poll showed the gops division on the issue 
hurt prochoice republicans they fared less well overall than 
hypothetical prochoice democrats because they lost the republican 
conservative base 
but prochoice republicans did well when paired in the poll 
against antiabortion democrats 
republican candidates who are prochoice have a 5point 
advantage over democratic candidates who are prolife said 
celinda lake of greenberglake the analysis group inc which 
conducted the poll 
the telephone survey was conducted from dec 1216 1989 among 
810 randomly selected registered voters each state was represented 
in proportion to its share of the nations population 
the margin of error for the poll was plus or minus 35 
percentage points said lake 
a sample of 200 hispanic voters surveyed for emilys list found 
37 percent supported keeping abortion legal under all circumstances 
and 51 percent under certain circumstances twelve percent were 
against legalized abortion 
she said that 68 percent of those questioned in the overall 
survey believe parental consent should be given before minors can 
get an abortion and 27 percent oppose such a requirement

foreign aid keeps growing so do the 
complaints 
about 371 billion has been dispersed since the end of world war 
ii a lot of money by any yardstick so is the 146 billion in 
economic and military assistance uncle sam is delivering this year 
that amounts to about 60 per american 
compare foreign aid spending to the 300 billion the pentagon 
gets this year for its weapons programs and other operations its 
about 47 percent 
or compare foreign aid to the total us budget of more than 
12 trillion it amounts to 12 percent 
almost every year congress calls for cuts in foreign aid the 
twist this time is a proposal by senate republican leader robert 
dole of kansas to redirect 400 million to eastern europe and 
panama at the expense of some current recipients 
that has made israel very nervous as it tries to keep pace with 
arms shipments to arab enemies while settling an extraordinary 
influx of soviet jews that could total 500000 over the next three 
years 
israel is the largest recipient of us aid 18 billion in 
military help and 12 billion in economic assistance some of the 
other favored nations egypt turkey pakistan and the philippines 
are quieter about doles proposal but probably anxious as well 
dole appeared to have support from the bush administration the 
state department was quick to endorse the concept of 
flexibility in providing aid although officials stressed that 
israel and other favored nations were not being targeted 
but on thursday word spread on capitol hill that president bush 
actually would ask congress to boost spending on foreign aid and 
other international operations by about 18 billion next year 
and israeli defense minister yitzhak rabin left town after talks 
with bush administration officials saying he had reason to 
believe us assistance to his country would hold steady at 3 
billion through 1991 
it is not clear what the white house is up to by seeming to 
encourage dole while developing its own plan to increase foreign 
aid 
still the problems dole touched on budget strictures and a 
desire to help eastern europeans as they make a painful adjustment 
to capitalist economies are real 
prodded by congress the president last year agreed to allocate 
553 million in aid this year to poland and hungary the first 
breakaway countries czechoslovakia romania east germany and 
bulgaria are following in their footsteps 
to me dole said tuesday it boils down to this are big 
gains for freedom worth a small cut in a few huge aid programs i 
say yes 
but there is another view find the money someplace else such 
as at the pentagon where billions are spent on weapons that quickly 
become obsolete some are faulty from the start and soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachevs efforts to reduce tensions in 
europe may be making others wasteful 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio attacking doles plan said that 
rather than cutting funds to close allies lets find more money 
for democracy in costly unnecessary weapons programs like sdi the 
spacebased strategic defense initiative the b2 bomber and the 
mobile mx missile 
traditionally american presidents embrace foreign aid and 
dutifully take on congressional skeptics 
back in 1974 for instance richard m nixon said the 41 
billion he proposed to spend on economic aid would be useful 
building sound foundations for a durable peace 
three years later gerald r ford asked congress for 47 
billion in military and economic aid so the united states could 
take the lead in creating conditions which will insure justice 
international cooperation and enduring peace 
when congress comes back next week however some of the members 
are bound to express a contrary view and the battle over foreign 
aid will be on

president bush invoking memories of the 1988 
campaign has his biggest thanks for campaign loyalists for one 
thing you did not ask me to do 
you never asked me to make a video riding in a tank bush 
told a boisterous crowd of 2000 at a bushquayle campaign reunion 
thursday night 
the joke a reference to a much ridiculed michael dukakis pose 
in a tank set the tone for the gop partisans who cheered bush 
vice president dan quayle republican party chairman lee atwater 
and the brain trust of the 1988 bush victory drive 
im sorry if im late bush quipped the 18wheeler got a 
flat then i got tangled up in the flag and the metal detector got 
set off by a silver foot doesnt it all come back to you now 
bush took to driving a tractortrailer in new england to smite 
his patrician image after he got clobbered in the iowa caucuses he 
made the flag a theme of his campaign and texan ann richards poked 
fun at him at the democratic convention by saying he was born with 
a silver foot in his mouth 
the toughest part for me was the debates some time has passed 
so i want to recognize my opponent bush said he was strong 
tough tenacious and a real fighter and i gained a newfound 
respect for dan rather 
bush squared off with rather in a contentious interview early in 
the campaign when the cbs anchorman sought to pin the thenvice 
president down on his knowledge of the irancontra affair 
the reunion brought together the principals of the bush 
campaign with the exception of secretary of state james a baker

hundreds of soviet moslems crossed the 
border between iran and the troubled soviet republic of azerbaijan 
the largest number to cross in one day since protests and ethnic 
violence broke out along the frontier this month 
the official islamic republic news agency said 430 soviet 
azerbaijanis returned from visits to iran thursday after scores of 
their iranian relatives staged a fourhour farewell ceremony irna 
also said dozens of azerbaijanis crossed into iran 
the soviet union has dispatched thousands of troops to try to 
quell the fighting between the shiite moslem azerbaijanis and the 
christian armenian minority 
the soviets boarded two boats for the trip across the araks 
river that forms the border they spent two days in iran irna 
said returning with copies of the koran prayer books pictures of 
the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini and other souvenirs 
both hosts and guests vociferously cried allahu akbar 
god is great irna said 
tehran radio said dozens of arriving azerbaijanis chanted 
islamic slogans as they crossed into iran to visit their ethnic 
brethren they share a common language culture and religion 
the number arriving in iran thursday was not specified 
the report said soviet and iranian border guards who watched the 
crossing took no action to stop the azerbaijanis 
the radio did not specify how the azerbaijanis crossed into 
iran but it has reported daily on soviet moslems swimming across 
the araks river this month for short visits 
the ethnic clashes were preceded by the dec 31 demonstrations 
when hundreds of soviet moslems gathered on the bank of the araks 
demanding an open border and free trade with their iranian brethren 
there have been almost daily protests along the border but irna 
said the state of emergency apparently prevented the gathering 
thursday 
iran has said it welcomes any soviet moslems who wish to visit 
the violence in the caucasus is rooted in a historical animosity 
between the soviet azerbaijanis and armenians over who should 
control the mostly armenian enclave of nagornokarabakh the region 
has been part of the azerbaijani republic since 1923 
while many countries have backed moscows decision to send in 
troops to put down the violence an iranian newspaper deplored such 
action irna reported 
it quoted the farsilanguage daily abrar as saying that the 
deployment of soviet forces in azerbaijan is a development capable 
of gradually changing the situation there into a tinder box ready 
to explode in the future 
the daily warned that any indiscreet handling of the situation 
by the soviet government may very well rouse 1 billion sympathetic 
moslems throughout the world

of the united states to a japanese airline 
the tokyo district court later sentenced him to a 2year jail 
term hashimoto who denied the bribery charges took his case to 
the supreme court but the court has not yet issued a ruling 
the lockheed scandal erupted in 1976 when the us aircraft 
maker acknowledged it had bribed japanese officials to influence

that time in japans postwar history and caused a split in the 
liberal democrats that took several years to repair

according to the legends 
it was the riches produced by spanish miners or the war loot of an 
apache chief some say the government spirited it away before the 
area was cleared for bombing practice 
few have seen the gold cache said to be beneath victorio peak 
but one man has died over it 
the grandson of that man has marshaled a team of engineers and 
geologists and convinced a wealthy californian to invest 2 
million in a renewed search for an american el dorado said to 
be worth 3 billion 
terry delonas 41 is the grandson of milton e doc noss 
who claimed he found the gold stacked in an underground cavern in 
1937 while hunting with his wife ova noss said it was sealed in 
the cave when he tried to blast a wider entrance with dynamite 
three official searches since then have come up emptyhanded 
but delonas who took a group of journalists on a tour of the area 
thursday said he plans to begin searching again in april 
he is determined to save his dead grandfathers honor delonas 
said for there are those who say noss was a conman 
he died in 1949 shot to death by charlie ryan in an argument 
over money ryan had invested in the search for the cache ryan was 
acquitted on grounds of selfdefense 
aaron kin a 26yearold beverly hills calif real estate 
developer who is bankrolling the dig seems relaxed about the 
venture 
for one thing he believes he could recoup the investment 
without even finding the gold 
weve got other directions to go as far as a movie to the 
story theres other avenues besides the gold outlet he said 
besides kin said the amount of work that was put into this 
project tells me that these people wouldnt be doing this unless it 
was true 
letha guthrie the 74yearold daughter of ova noss claims to 
have handled several gold ingots and artifacts that noss brought 
from the cavern and hid in the desert 
the army has denied rumors that the federal government found and 
removed the gold years ago 
delonas said three previous excavations were not as well 
financed were too short and lacked cooperation from the army 
ground radar used in the latest 1977 search showed a large cavern 
under the peak he said 
delonas group has a 365day contract with the army to search in 
the southcentral new mexico preserve an amendment to the 1989 
defense authorization act allows the noss family heirs to dig for 
the treasure the area has been closed to the public since 1955 
the excavators must leave the peak during target practice and 
missile firings white sands spokesman jim eckels said any cost to 
the army such as military police escorts will have to be paid by 
the noss family 
delonas said he is conducting the treasure hunt in memory of his 
grandmother who died in 1979 telling her grandson to carry on 
but he admitted wanting a little more than family honor 
certainly with the money and effort weve put into it wed 
like to have some monetary reward he said

frustrated by ulysses s grants refusal to 
pose for a portrait a swiss artist commissioned to glorify the 
union triumph in the civil war decided instead to paint grants old 
nemesis robert e lee in a daring gesture of spite 
the longforgotten oil painting by flamboyant artist frank 
buchser spent the next 120 years gathering dust in a museum in his 
native switzerland until it was found by swiss ambassador edouard 
brunner and brought back to the united states last year 
tonight on the 184th anniversary of lees birth brunner will 
unveil the newly restored portrait of the confederate general at an 
embassy reception attended by alumni of washington and lee 
university in lexington va 
lee was president of washington college in lexington for five 
years after his april 9 1865 surrender to grant at appomattox 
ended the civil war the institution was renamed in lees honor 
after his death in 1870 
brunner obtained the portrait on permanent loan from the swiss 
national museum in bern to the embassy in washington it is the 
last portrait of lee to be painted from life and one of only three 
for which lee ever posed 
lee who rarely consented to pose even for photographers 
relented to the charming buchsers entreaties he sat for the 
painter for three weeks in the fall of 1869 about a year before he 
died 
lee refused to wear his old confederate commanderinchiefs 
uniform saying i am a soldier no longer and posed instead in 
the black broadcloth suit he had worn at his sons wedding 
buchser however persuaded lee to sit next to a table where the 
artist had arranged the former generals hat binoculars and the 
sword belt sash and uniform coat that lee had worn at appomattox 
buchser had been commissioned by a group of swiss liberals who 
admired the union cause in the civil war and wanted portraits of 
northern heroes including grant to hang in the swiss parliament 
in bern 
when grant repeatedly refused to pose buchser painted lees 
portrait in the hope he could persuade grant to change his mind 
grant never consented but the lee painting though unpopular with 
buchsers patrons who refused to pay for it came to be regarded 
as buchsers finest portrait and went on permanent display at the 
bern museum 
a known brawler and womanizer who sported a 12inch waxed 
mustache buchser arrived in lexington unannounced but quickly won 
lees confidence and captivated his wife and daughters with his 
handkissing european manners and his lively performances on the 
guitar and piano 
buchser soon embraced lee as a father figure what a gentle 
noble soul how kind and charming the old whitehaired warrior 
is the artist wrote in his diary 
when he returned to europe buchser declared that lee was the 
ideal of american democracy the artist even grew a beard and 
trimmed his mustache to look like lee 
during their hours together lee shared his private thoughts 
with buchser in a way he rarely did with others 
according to the artists diary lee praised former confederate 
president jefferson davis for his character but called him one of 
the extremest politicians lee also made unflattering comments 
about grants skills as a military tactician 
one of the two other life portraits of lee was painted by an 
obscure artist in 1833 when lee was a young muttonchopped 
lieutenant with the us army engineers it hangs in the crypt of 
lee chapel on the wampl campus where lee is buried 
the other portrait painted in 1853 by another littleknown 
artist shows lee as superintendent of the us military academy at 
west point ny that painting hangs in the home of lees 
granddaughter mrs william hunter de butts in upperville va 
brunner said he brought the lee portrait to washington to join 
another buchser portrait of union gen william tecumseh sherman at 
the ambassadors residence here both belong to the swiss 
government he said and will remain at the embassy

the dollar rose against the japanese yen today and 
share prices on the tokyo stock exchange rebounded moderately after 
three consecutive days of decline 
the dollar closed at 14633 yen up 067 yen from thursdays 
close of 14566 yen after opening at 14620 yen it ranged between 
14615 yen and 14670 yen 
a currency dealer with the bank of tokyo said market sentiment 
for the dollar remains bullish following its overnight rise on 
the new york market 
the dollars strength followed statements by two officials from 
the us federal reserve board that it would not cut interest rates 
any time soon 
manuel johnson a vice chairman of the us federal reserve 
board and wayne angell a governor of the board were quoted in 
thursdays wall street journal as saying they would not support 
easier shortterm us interest rates unless economic conditions 
changed 
higher interest rates tend to support a countrys currency 
traders said the bank of japan probably sold between 300 
million and 600 million during the tokyo trading day although few 
participants could verify the intervention 
the bank of japan sold a lot of dollars when it rose to 14660 
yen it was pretty effective because there was a lot of 
profittaking on longdollar positions at that level said robert 
mckeon a trader with manufacturers hanover in tokyo 
mckeon said that rumors in the market that the central bank 
could raise the official discount rate in the near future partly 
to counter the dollars strength and high money supply growth gave 
support to the yen against both the dollar and the mark 
on the stock market the nikkei stock average of 225 selected 
issues which slipped 9168 yen on thursday rebounded 10708 
points or 029 percent to close at 3683654 
the benchmark index fell in morning trading as investors were 
concerned about the yens decline against the dollar and falling 
interest rates on japanese bond futures 
but share prices rebounded in a lastminute round of 
futureslinked buying in afternoon trading 
securities dealers said the market seems to have hit bottom 
after falling more than 2000 points since the beginning of the 
year but there was not enough strength for a decisive rally 
the afternoon rebound of japanese government bond prices helped 
the stock prices to recover they said 
volume traded on the first section of the exchange where most 
major shares are listed was estimated at 500 million shares

there was plenty of blame to go around at the 
end of the lengthy and traumatic mcmartin preschool molestation 
trial but no one was willing to accept it 
in the nations longest and costliest trial raymond buckey and 
his mother peggy mcmartin buckey were acquitted thursday on 52 
child molestation charges the jury deadlocked on 13 other charges 
afterward the district attorney who filed the case criticized 
the current district attorney the current district attorney blamed 
his predecessor and defense attorneys and some of the parents of 
children who attended the school blamed everybody 
the system is not going to protect children said jackie 
mcgauley a parent who believes her child had been molested but 
didnt testify in the case life is not fair said robert 
curry whose son attended the mcmartin school i tell my children 
all the time there is no such thing as fair 
the district attorney who originally pursued the case said he 
would not have done anything differently 
robert philibosian now in private practice angrily dismissed 
accusations that he played up the mcmartin case in 1984 with the 
news media acting as eager accomplices to boost his public 
profile as he ran for district attorney 
i was a professional prosecutor for 16 years before this case 
was brought he said to have people who know very little about 
professional or prosecutorial ethics to criticize me personally 
that i have some political motive is totally unjustified 
philibosian instead pointed the finger at the man who defeated 
him current district attorney ira reiner philibosian said reiner 
hurt prosecutors chances by dismissing charges against five of the 
original seven defendants and criticizing the case in a 1986 60 
minutes interview 
but reiner calling his dismissal of charges for lack of 
evidence the decision were proud of said the trial took so 
long because of the states ponderous criminal justice system 
delay tactics by defense attorneys and a mess left behind by 
philibosian 
this is a case i inherited reiner said 
in interviews many jurors said they believed some of the 
children were molested but the prosecution never established that 
the defendants were responsible 
even if you accept that the children were molested it didnt 
necessarily mean they were molested at the mcmartin preschool 
said juror brenda williams

jerusalem police today arrested proplo 
palestinian activist faisal husseini who has been considered a 
potential negotiator in proposed israelipalestinian talks 
police spokesman uzi sandori said husseini was brought in for 
questioning and would be taken to court where police would request 
an extension of his detention 
on thursday husseini was named as an unindicted coconspirator 
in a military court trial of five jerusalem palestinians the five 
were accused of forming a plosupported popular army unit to 
carry out the orders of the underground leadership of the 
antiisraeli uprising 
according to court documents husseini allegedly gave the men 
money and agreed to consult with them about their activities 
husseini 49 denied those allegations before his arrest 
there is no truth to that story he said in a telephone 
interview thursday 
family members today confirmed that police took husseini from 
his home in arab east jerusalem at about 730 am they had no 
details of the charges 
however israel radio said husseini is expected to be held on 
incitement charges because of statements he made about the killing 
of palestinians suspected of collaborating with israel it said he 
also may be investigated in connection with the military court case 
against the five palestinians 
at a news conference in september sponsored by the foreign press 
association husseini accused israel of organizing groups of armed 
collaborators 
the reaction from the people palestinians was that they had 
to get rid of these collaborators husseini said the 
responsibility for the killings is with the occupiers 
he said attacks on collaborators occurred under any occupation 
we dont like to see any palestinian killed husseini said 
at the same time we dont like to see collaborators among us 
sari nusseibeh another leading palestinian activist who was 
named as an unindicted coconspirator in a similar case last year 
said husseinis arrest would have a negative impact on the peace 
process 
he added it confirms peoples growing belief that the israeli 
government is not at all serious about the peace process and tries 
everything it can to wriggle out of it 
the arrest came as defense minister yitzhak rabin was winding up 
talks with us leaders in washington rabin has been discussing 
ways to break the current stalemate in efforts to convene 
palestinianisraeli talks in cairo 
the efforts are deadlocked in part over the composition of a 
10member palestinian delegation husseinis name has been raised 
repeatedly as a possible negotiator but rightwing israeli 
politicians contend he has been a key figure in the 25month 
uprising and have called for his arrest 
husseini heads the nowclosed arab studies society in east 
jerusalem he spent 18 months in israeli prisons at the start of 
the uprising but was never charged or tried 
in recent weeks israel has issued two orders banning husseini 
from traveling to the occupied lands and from going abroad the 
order banning travel abroad also affected six other palestinians 
and drew a strong protest from the united states 
in another development thursday the army filed charges in a 
special military court against col yehuda meir the 
highestranking officer to face trial for brutality during the 
uprising 
meir who served as military commander of nablus in the west 
bank was charged with eight offenses for ordering soldiers to beat 
and break the limbs of 20 arabs from the beita and hawara villages 
in january 1988

their customers

nine chronic diseases responsible for more than 
half the deaths in the united states are getting only 2 percent of 
the states public health dollars according to new federal health 
research 
the national centers for disease control reported thursday that 
the chronic diseases diseases with long periods of onset or 
suffering accounted for 11 million deaths in 1986 52 percent of 
the deaths nationwide 
the diseases are stroke heart disease diabetes obstructive 
lung disease lung cancer breast cancer cervical cancer 
colorectal cancer and cirrhosis of the liver 
cigarette smoking overweight high blood pressure drinking and 
lack of exercise contribute to some or all of the diseases 
theyre all largely preventable or preventable to some 
extent said dr robert hahn a cdc epidemiologist 
we know what the risk factors are hahn said we know less 
about how you get people to act on them 
the survey of 45 states and the district of columbia found that 
less than 2 percent of state public health expenditures were 
allocated to prevent and control chronic disease the average state 
expenditure was just 66 cents per person per year hahn said 
comparable figures on federal public health spending for chronic 
disease were not available hahn said 
most of the health money from state governments in the united 
states is tied up in medicaid especially with the mounting 
federal deficit in the 1980s said dr robert blendon chairman of 
the department of health policy and management at the harvard 
school of public health 
most public health activities at the state level were paid for 
by federal grants but those grants are now fewer and states are 
left scrambling just to fund medicaid care for their sickest 
citizens blendon said 
prevention of chronic disease became the residual that 
disappeared he said 
its very frustrating we just dont have the early warning 
prevention systems the minimal stuff that anybody who looks 
sensibly at this would want to do blendon said 
the 1986 death toll from the cdcs list of nine chronic diseases 
included 593000 deaths from heart disease 149000 from stroke 
125000 from lung cancer 71000 from obstructive lung disease 
such as emphysema and 55000 from colorectal cancer there were 
40000 breast cancer deaths 37000 from diabetes 26000 from 
cirrhosis and 4500 cervical cancer deaths 
the cdc said death rates from the nine preventable chronic 
diseases were generally lower in the west the highest 1986 death 
rate was in michigan 518 such deaths per 100000 people lowest 
was in hawaii 327 per 100000

the seabrook nh nuclear power plant 
could be generating power for a million new england homes by may 
under a licensing schedule laid out by the nuclear regulatory 
commission 
the commission said thursday that it would make a decision 
within three weeks on whether to issue a fullpower license to the 
longembattled plant 
the announcement by nrc chairman kenneth carr came after the 
commission listened for three hours as plant operators and the nrc 
staff reported that seabrook is ready to begin producing 
electricity at full power 
in a victory for plant opponents the nrc agreed to rule on 
several contested issues including emergency evacuation plans 
before deciding on the license 
there is reasonable assurance that the plant can and will be 
operated without endangering the health and safety of the public 
the nrc staff concluded in its report to the commission the 
staff recommends commission approval to issue a fullpower 
license 
thomas murley the nrcs director of nuclear reactor regulation 
told the commission that emergency preparedness at seabrook is 
adequate to support fullpower operations 
seabrook conceived more than two decades ago and built near a 
salt marsh two miles north of the massachusetts border cost 64 
billion and the price tag is still rising it has generated mass 
protests by environmentalists lawsuits by massachusetts officials 
and bankruptcy protection for its beleaguered principal owner 
public service company of new hampshire 
only three of the fivemember nrc board will decide seabrooks 
fate two others said they would abstain from the deliberations 
because of past involvement at lower levels in the seabrook 
licensing process

a graduate student told a jury he became 
frightened when he realized the worm program he introduced into a 
federal computer network was replicating out of control 
robert t morris speaking publicly for the first time about the 
nov 2 1988 attack that disabled an estimated 6000 computers 
nationwide testified thursday that the worm was an experiment that 
turned into a dismal failure because of a programming error he 
made 
are you proud of yourself his attorney thomas guidoboni 
asked 
no im not said morris 25 who has been suspended by 
cornell university and faces up to five years in prison and a 
250000 fine if convicted of a felony computertampering charge 
i was scared it seemed like the worm was getting out of 
control morris said my purpose was to see if i could write a 
program that would spread as widely as possible my intention was 
that it should not grow the worm spread on the network far faster 
than i expected 
morris testimony was the last in the federal trial closing 
statements are scheduled for monday 
questioned by prosecutor mark rasch morris freely admitted 
designing the worm to break into the internet network which links 
computers at major universities nasa and several military 
facilities 
morris said he gathered passwords from various universities and 
without permission decoded them to make sure the worm would spread 
widely he said he also took steps to make it difficult to detect 
during questioning by guidoboni morris told the jury he 
included mechanisms to limit the worms growth and left out any 
commands that would have caused it to permanently damage existing 
files in the computers it attacked 
he said he wanted to avoid overloading the network so he 
decided on a method to let the worm reenter computers it already 
had infected just once in every seven tries 
morris thought the worm would duplicate a few times a day or 
every few hours but the programming error caused the worm to 
continually reenter each computer 
morris said he unleashed the worm into the internet network 
through computers at the massachusetts institute of technology in 
cambridge mass at about 8 pm on nov 2 1988 
he said he then went out for dinner and when he returned about 
three hours later he noticed cornells own computer was slow to 
respond to commands 
morris said that when he found copies of the worm in the cornell 
system he knew it was spreading and realized it wasnt working 
right 
initially morris said he considered sending out a second worm 
designed to track down and destroy the first worm but morris said 
he decided against that after seeing the unpredictable nature of 
the first worm 
instead he said he called andrew sudduth a friend at harvard 
university and asked him to send a message on an electronic 
bulletin board read mainly by internet users morris said he wanted 
to apologize for unleashing the worm and tell users how to 
eliminate it 
sudduth testified wednesday that it took two days for the 
message to reach the bulletin board because the route he picked was 
backed up

ray will die is scrawled in 
big black letters on the faded green paint of the mcmartin 
preschool testimony to the rage inflamed by the notorious 
childmolesting case 
former mcmartin teachers raymond buckey and his mother peggy 
mcmartin buckey were acquitted thursday of 52 charges of molesting 
students jurors were deadlocked on 13 other counts 
whatever happens on those charges few in this 
uppermiddleclass los angeles suburb would disagree with the judge 
in the trial william pounders who once said the case has 
poisoned everyone who had contact with it 
sue brown a receptionist at a medical office across the street 
from the school said she had two friends who were involved in the 
case and had been convinced of the buckeys guilt 
i think they got off scotfree brown said im really 
sick about it 
alan lagunoff whose son now 10 testified against the buckeys 
stood in front of the rundown longclosed nursery school and 
talked about his disappointment 
the defense did everything to prolong the case and the 
prosecution did not do enough research to prosecute the case 
properly he said 
a cold wind blasted leaves across the schoolyard as lagunoff 
leaned on the rusted chainlink fence surrounding the dilapidated 
lshaped building 
id like to see the school become a center for abused 
children he said it should be put to some good use rather 
than tear it down 
but another longtime manhattan beach resident disagreed 
id like to see it torn down said brenda platt id like 
to have no memories of this 
platt who has two children aged 1 and 3 said she has serious 
doubts about placing them in a daycare center because of the 
mcmartin trial 
i think the mcmartin case is a disgrace to manhattan beach 
and society its totally upsetting platt said 
linda geisert another resident of the beach city was also 
upset 
im greatly disappointed in the legal system and quite frankly 
in the jurors geisert said 
for all his disappointment lagunoff said he did not feel the 
prosecutors should retry the remaining 13 counts 
it would be just more of the same circus he said 
we put so much faith and hope in our courts said robert 
canter 74 and this is what we get frustration

gov rose mofford said she was lying in a 
hospital bed when she first started thinking about not seeking a 
full term in the office 
on thursday her first day back at work since undergoing surgery 
a month ago to remove her gallbladder she announced she would not 
seek election this fall and retire after nearly half a century in 
state government 
mofford became governor two years ago with the impeachment of 
thengov evan mecham she had been secretary of state 
there are so many things i want to do that i dont think there 
will be enough time left in my life to do them all the 
67yearold democrat said 
i feel this one i have to call for rosie 
she has been plagued by medical problems including a 
concussion cataracts and headaches 
but she denied she was bowing out of politics because of her 
health

returned to the capitol only to deliver an abbreviated state of the 
state address jan 8

particularly damaging was her commutation of the prison 
sentences of two convicted murderers last year which she later 
rescinded saying she didnt realize that families of the victims 
had not been notified 
mrs moffords decision not to run opens the door for other 
democrats who had stayed out of the contest mecham and several 
other republicans have already announced their intention to run for 
governor

treasurers office and never left state government she was

citizens of nagasaki protested what they 
called a threat to free speech today as police questioned a 
rightwing extremist accused of trying to kill mayor hitoshi 
motoshima 
the 67yearold mayor was reported in stable condition a day 
after he was shot in the back as he left city hall the mayor had 
received death threats for over a year after he said the late 
emperor hirohito bore some responsibility for world war ii 
about 300 city hall workers rallied today in a parking lot 
beside their building to denounce the attack and demand that police 
crack down on antiextremists 
the attack an unusual event in a country where handguns are 
outlawed was said to be the first shooting of an important 
politician in japan since world war ii 
police were questioning an avowed rightwing terrorist kazumi 
tajiri 40 of tokyo and searching offices of his group called 
the sane thinkers school a nagasaki state police spokesman said 
tajiri admitted to shooting motoshima and was being held on 
suspicion of attempted murder the spokesman said on condition of 
anonymity 
police said they found a 22caliber pistol in the hotel room 
where tajiri was arrested with one spent shell and four live 
bullets 
the national police agency urged local authorities to increase 
their vigilance over the nations 820 rightwing groups and 
recommended tighter security for public figures said an agency 
spokesman in tokyo 
at the nagasaki rally yukiyoshi sato secretarygeneral of the 
city hall workers union said the mayor risked his own life in 
fighting to protect freedom of speech and democracy 
we declare our resolve to resolutely uphold these principles 
in the wake of this attempt to suppress them with a pistol 
the nagasaki city council said in a declaration this incident 
is not only a challenge to freedom of speech but a threat to the 
very existence of a democratic society and is unpardonable 
its a real shock said city hall worker mikako umehara 
in japan its so rare for anyone to have a gun just police and 
gangsters for this to happen right in front of our eyes is i 
think a much bigger shock than for americans or europeans 
this act should never be condoned in light of democracy and 
freedom foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe said today 
the government he said must take all possible measures to 
prevent such incidents he did not elaborate 
tajiris group which has a record of violence was active in 
the rightist intimidation campaign against motoshima it began 
after the mayor said in december 1988 that the late emperor 
shares responsibility for the war as well as all of us who lived 
in that period 
motoshima said the emperor could have ended the war sooner and 
spared nagasaki from its atomicbomb attack nagasaki was struck on 
aug 9 1945 three days after hiroshima japan surrendered on aug 
15 
the mayors comments made as hirohito lay dying of cancer 
outraged the rightists who revere the imperial family hirohito 
died jan 7 1988 at the age of 87 
the mayors opinion is shared by many japanese as evidenced by 
the 286000 people who signed petitions backing his statement but 
rightist groups have circled nagasaki city hall many times with 
sound trucks blaring death to motoshima 
in 1987 tajiri appeared in an interview at tv asahi where he 
was asked if he was willing to kill somebody he hated 
yes because after all rightwingers are terrorists 
replied tajiri 
people who answered the phone or the door intercom at his 
groups offices refused to speak to reporters 
free speech is guaranteed in japans postwar constitution but 
in the past newspapers and others who exercise it have sometimes 
been the target of rightist violence 
an attack blamed on rightists at an office of asahi shimbun a 
leading newspaper killed one reporter and wounded another in 1987

former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone filed a 
libel suit against a leading national newspaper today claiming it 
had falsely accused him of involvement in a stock deal his aide 
said 
in the lawsuit filed with the tokyo district court nakasone 
demanded that the newspaper asahi shimbun publish an apology 
said yoshihiko kamiwada nakasones secretary 
the article was filled with malice and inaccuracies he 
said nakasone had no part in the stock deal 
asahi which has an estimated daily circulation of 8 million 
reported in a frontpage story jan 1 that nakasone was involved in 
a behindthescenes stock deal in 1987 while still in office 
it reported that one of his aides earned profits of 85700 from 
what it described as questionable share transactions in kokusai 
kogyo a tokyobased aerial surveying contractor 
kamiwada said the asahi article led readers to believe nakasone 
was personally involved in the deal though he said there was no 
evidence to support such allegations 
we have said repeatedly that the stock deal was done by his 
secretary independently he said it is clear that asahi was 
trying to hurt nakasones image and damage him in the coming 
election 
asahi spokesman takemi akiba said in a statement that the 
article was objectively reported 
we have conducted more than sufficient investigations and have 
gotten testimony of parties involved he said and we have full 
confidence 
nakasone has been shadowed for more than a year by allegations 
he was involved in the separate recruit influencepeddling scandal 
nakasone was never charged in that scandal but opposition 
parties forced him to testify at a parliamentary hearing in may he 
resigned on may 29 after the hearing to take responsibility for the 
recruit scandal 
since then nakasone has been fighting an uphill battle to 
maintain his influence analysts say he needs an overwhelming win 
in the upcoming election of parliaments lower house scheduled for 
feb 18 to return to the governing party

thousands of miners who struck for higher 
pay returned to work today at three southern mines and 
negotiations were under way to end two other walkouts the official 
news agency pap said 
the strikes which began tuesday were the first significant 
labor protest since the jan 1 start of radical reforms aimed at 
transforming polands economy to capitalism 
strikes ended this morning at the thorez walbrzych and victoria 
mines in walbrzych a city 12 miles from the czechoslovak border 
pap said 
the resolution followed negotiations between miners 
representatives and the industry ministry in warsaw but no details 
were reported 
negotiations also were reported under way to resolve strikes by 
about 6000 workers at the czerwone zaglebie mine and another 40 at 
the niwka modrzejow mine both in the city of sosnowiec just 
outside katowice an industrial center about 185 miles south of 
warsaw 
the miners at the czerwone zaglebie mine have been demanding a 
26 supplement to their wages for december the miners in walbrzych 
had similar demands pap said 
all the striking miners are calling for retention of special 
shopping privileges for miners a reduction in administrative 
workers in offices and no repercussions against strikers 
solidarity leader lech walesa said strikes were an inappropriate 
response at this point to the nations difficult economic 
situation if everybody strikes anarchy a lack of 
understanding will deepen he said during a news conference 
thursday in gdansk 
under the economic plan the government has sharply raised 
prices but halted wage increases while trying to create a 
marketoriented economy and curb inflation 
none of the mines involved in the current protests partcipated 
in the august 1988 strikes that pushed polands thencommunist 
government to begin political reform talks with the solidarityled 
opposition 
those talks led to parliamentary elections in june and the 
formation in august of the east blocs first noncommunist 
government

a threat of fog that proved real 
blocked columbias return to earth until saturday making for the 
longest space shuttle mission yet 
the shuttle had planned a predawn landing today at edwards air 
force base calif but mission control decided to keep columbia in 
orbit because conditions were favorable for a fog bank to move in 
suddenly 
the new landing time of 1201 am pst extends the flight to 
nearly 11 days surpassing the old record by 11 hours 38 minutes 
that was set by columbia in 1983 
capsule communicator mike baker early today initially directed 
the five astronauts to lengthen the flight by one orbit or 95 
minutes in case the fog forecast improved 
when it didnt he said weve decided not to come home today 
the weather looks a lot better saturday 
ok sounds like the best plan columbia commander dan 
brandenstein responded earlier he said this is not a good 
vehicle to fly into fog 
the forecasters proved right dense patches of fog formed and 
were in the area at the planned landing time flight rules dictate 
visibility of seven miles for landing 
our concerns were valid and we did the proper thing today 
said flight director lee briscoe 
the initial directive to hold off was relayed to the astronauts 
just three hours before they were to have fired their reentry 
engines wrapping up a flight that deployed one satellite and 
rescued another 
the shuttle will have four chances saturday to land at the 
mojave desert base 
columbia carries enough fuel and other supplies to stay in orbit 
until at least monday officials said 
other us landing sites at the kennedy space center in florida 
and at white sands missile base nm also had unacceptable 
weather conditions today 
the space travelers planned a day of exercising photography and 
other light activity 
their day began at 935 pm est thursday with mission control

a streetwise veteran of the civil rights 
movement marion barry has always prided himself on being a 
survivor 
my background is one of survival barry told the washington 
post a month before his first election as mayor in 1978 
i mean i was lucky you know he said i used to run 
around with guys who went to prison or are dead i was lucky i was 
the one who didnt get caught by the police when we were out 
shooting dice or something 
now after more than a decade as mayor of the nations capital 
barrys survival skills were facing their severest test after his 
arrest on a narcotics charge thursday night at a downtown hotel 
a federal law enforcement source said authorities had a 
videotape of barry smoking cocaine 
the son of mississippi sharecroppers barry claimed he could 
move as easily among royalty as among the citys poor boasting 
im the mayor of all the people even as he was found in 
compromising positions that put investigators on his path 
barry has been under federal investigation during much of the 
time since 1984 for his ties to drug suspects two deputy mayors 
went to jail for crimes in office and recent news reports suggested 
the wall of silence created by barrys friends was crumbling as 
some former associates testified before a grand jury 
barry has always liked to point to the gunshot wound he suffered 
in the city hall building in 1977 as an example of how he could 
never be counted out 
he is not going to go out quietly said max berry a former 
key political adviser after the mayors arrest 
berry who turned against barry after the mayors troubles grew 
last year added if he has not been telling the truth to the 
people hes going to face the possibility of resigning but he has 
always been a strong campaigner and a proud person what kind of 
effect this will have on his ego i dont know 
earlier this month a los angeles times profile got him into 
political hot water when he was quoted as boasting he would cut his 
opponents off at the kneecaps and that jesse jackson a 
potential mayoral opponent whom barry once supported dont wanna 
run nothing but his mouth 
barry scoffed at federal investigators always denying he ever 
used drugs 
barry and his third wife effi have one son christopher 10 
he was born on march 6 1936 to marion and mattie barry in the 
small mississippi delta town of itta bena and was raised in 
memphis after the death of his father a sharecropper 
barry did graduate work in chemistry at fisk university in 
nashville but was sidetracked on his way to a doctorate by the 
growing civil rights movement and left school with a masters 
degree he was the first national chairman of the student 
nonviolent coordinating committee which sent young people into 
the south to register black voters 
sncc brought him to washington where he became immersed in 
local issues joining boycotts of the bus system and leading 
protests clad in traditional african garb 
with his second wife mary treadwell he helped found a black 
selfhelp group pride inc treadwell was convicted in 1983 of 
misusing funds in connection with a real estate spinoff of pride 
barrys high profile as an antiestablishment activist propelled 
him into local politics first as a member of the board of 
education and then in 1974 as a member of the first elected city 
council organized under home rule law 
in 1977 he was wounded by a shotgun blast in the hanafi muslim 
takeover of the district building the districts city hall a 
reporter was killed 
in 1978 only a decade after marching against the city 
establishment he defeated incumbent mayor walter washington in the 
citys democratic mayoral primary and went on to easily win the 
general election 
his tenure has been noted for extensive downtown office and 
hotel development a soaring murder rate among young drug users 
and critics charge deterioration of services like housing despite 
the largest city bureaucracy in the country on a per capita basis 
just this week barry boasted that the city was winning its war 
against violent crime he made that claim the same day president 
bush called january the month of murder in washington 
his legal troubles began shortly after his first reelection in 
1982 with the first of federal investigations he termed attempts 
to lynch black people another way 
in 1984 karen johnson a convicted cocaine dealer with whom 
barry admitted having a personal relationship served 11 months 
in jail on contempt of court charges rather than tell investigators 
whether she used drugs with barry or sold them to him 
the current round of investigation was touched off in december 
1988 when barry repeatedly visited the hotel room of a suspected 
drug dealer charles lewis city police were sent there to 
investigate a report that lewis was selling drugs but the mission 
was called off when officers found out barry was present 
lewis later was convicted of cocaine charges in the virgin 
islands and has pleaded guilty to a drug conspiracy count in 
washington there have been recent news reports that lewis told 
prosecutors he provided drugs to the mayor

prime minister vp singhs government today 
brought jammukashmir state under tighter federal control in an 
effort to combat escalating violence by moslem separatists 
the new state governor jagmohan told reporters the state 
legislature has been suspended and the region would now be 
administered through his office 
my top priority will now be to solve the kashmir problem but 
my approach will be that of love for an ailing patient as shown 
by a nursing orderly said jagmohan who has a reputation as a 
tough nononsense administrator 
he said he would visit srinagar the states summer capital and 
the stronghold of kashmiri militants on saturday to assess the 
situation 
militants in the kashmir region of the state are fighting to set 
up an independent moslem state or join neighboring pakistan an 
islamic nation 
at least 26 people have been killed in jammukashmir since the 
beginning of the year and moslem agitators have repeatedly 
attacked government buildings and police patrols 
in islamabad pakistan the leader of a moslem militant group 
today promised to make india pay for the appointment it clearly 
means the government is going to have a go at crushing our freedom 
fighters said amanullah khan the leader of the jammukashmir 
liberation front but they are going to find it will cost them 
far far more than they can imagine 
in new delhi home ministry spokesman krishna rao said 
jammukashmir had been placed under governors rule which is akin 
to federal rule 
under the indian constitution a governor is appointed by the 
federal government and is subject to the decisions of the state 
government which is headed by a locally elected chief minister 
but chief minister farooq abdullah resigned thursday night in 
protest of jagmohans appointment as governor claiming he had not 
been consulted 
when a chief minister resigns the governor can assume wide 
executive and legislative powers 
singhs government named jagmohan who uses one name to the 
governors post thursday morning after procuring his predecessors 
resignation the new governor took his oath of office today 
jagmohan speaking at his official residence that was once a 
palace of the former king of jammukashmir state said he has 
accepted the resignation of abdullah and his cabinet 
jammukashmir is the only indian state with a moslem majority 
moslems form about 12 percent of predominantly hindu indias 880 
million people and about 64 percent of jammukashmirs 5 million 
people 
abdullahs national conference a predominantly moslem party is 
closely aligned with the congress party of exprime minister rajiv 
gandhi and has differed with singhs national front government 
the militants also have rejected the national conferences 
authority to govern the state claiming it came to power through 
rigged elections 
jagmohan a hindu who served as jammukashmirs governor from 
1982 to 1988 has been credited by newspapers with curbing the 
spread of moslem agitation during his previous tenure

the communist party advocates a 
multiparty system parliamentary democracy and religious freedom 
in draft documents to be adopted at a party congress this month 
the party statement outlined late thursday and due to be voted 
on when the congress convenes jan 30 also called for eliminating 
the communists marxistleninist label 
the changes are in line with the communists efforts to shed the 
stalinist image left over from the 34year rule of hardline leader 
todor zhivkov zhivkov who was forced to step down nov 10 is now 
under house arrest and charged with abuse of power and fomenting 
ethnic unrest while in office 
the bulgarian communist party must be destalinized and 
established as a new type of contemporary marxist party said a 
draft declaration reported by the official bta news agency 
the report did not say when the drafts were formulated or by 
whom usually such draft documents are done by senior party members 
the political system of democratic socialism implies a 
multiparty system parliamentary democracy separation of 
legislative executive and judiciary powers guaranteed 
freedoms and autonomy of science and education the document 
said 
according to the declaration the communist party is willing to 
recognize religious and some ethnic rights of the 15 million 
minority turks and other bulgarian moslems known as pomaks 
zhivkovs oftenviolent forced assimilation policy banned 
moslem religious practices and required ethnic turks and moslems to 
forsake their own names and take bulgarian ones 
bulgarias society of national unity and agreement should 
unite all citizens to provide freedom of rites and the use of 
the language preferred in the everyday life while guaranteeing 
bulgarias territorial entity and sovereignty and the bulgarian 
language as an official one the draft declaration said 
the statement promised to provide guarantees against a relapse 
to authoritarian methods and style of leadership but it did not 
say what these guarantees would involve 
parliament on jan 15 abolished the communists guaranteed 
monopoly on power but talks with the opposition on powersharing 
and democratization broke down thursday after the leadership 
refused to provide media access to the talks a key opposition 
demand 
the draft provides for all party offices to be elective and for 
ballots to be secret 
all party officeholders apparently also including the party 
chief should only serve for two terms bta quoted the draft 
statute as saying 
it provided for the congress the supreme body of the communist 
party to be convened every two years instead of at fiveyear 
intervals as is the case now 
the document also urged a radical restructuring of the party 
which would include a supreme party council to replace the existing 
policysetting central committee 
within the supreme party council committees and working groups 
would be established to work on major problems of party 
activity bta said 
the declaration proposed that the supreme party council should 
elect a chairman two deputy chairmen and a secretary of the party 
together with the chairmen of the standing committees they 
would form the chairmanship of the party the apparent successor 
to the ruling politburo

a mysterious man dressed in black left a half 
bottle of cognac and three roses on edgar allan poes grave early 
today in a ritual that for 41 years has marked the horror writers 
birthday 
tonight at 3 am six of us inside westminster hall spotted a 
man dressed in black with a white scarf walk into the grave yard 
and place the cognac and roses on the grave said jeff jerome 
curator of the edgar allan poe house some saw a man with white 
hair and others didnt 
the gifts first were left on poes grave at westminster hall in 
1949 the 100th anniversary of his death said jerome 40 
there is some argument as to whether the same man has been 
responsible for leaving the gift for the entire 41 years or 
whether there has been a succession of grave decorators stopping 
the man to find out would be out of the question jerome said 
first of all that would be an invasion of privacy he said 
its none of our business if we interfered it would ruin it 
the man in black leaves a rose for each grave the bodies of 
poes wife virginia who died at 25 of tuberculosis and his aunt 
maria poe clemm are buried beside the writer 
among poes most wellknown stories are the pit and the 
pendulum and the fall of the house of usher as well as the

president mikhail s gorbachev today blamed 
violence between azerbaijanis and armenians on extremists fanning 
ethnic hatred to hurt his reforms and the government warned the 
turmoil could escalate into a national catastrophe 
gorbachev told a conference in moscow that despite the kremlins 
efforts about 29000 troops and police cadets are trying to 
maintain order in the southern republics the situation is not 
improving 
he said the sixday spasm of fighting in which at least 72 
people have died and more than 220 have been wounded served the 
interests of a group of extremists irresponsible adventurists 
and representatives of the shadow economy 
the shadow economy refers to the billions of rubles in illegal 
trade conducted outside the staterun economy 
perestroika is a bone in their throat but they cant oppose 
it directly so they clutch at tension on an ethnic basis 
gorbachev told a conference convened to discuss perestroika or 
restructuring 
gorbachev also blamed some azerbaijani extremists who he said 
are calling for the republic to secede from the ussr for an 
islamic azerbaijan the tass news agency said but he said 
among the people they are not receiving support 
most azerbaijanis are moslems and most armenians are 
christians the two republics have been involved in a decadesold 
dispute over a region known as nagornokarabakh which is inside 
azerbaijan but populated mainly by armenians 
the current violence is the worst since the dispute erupted anew 
two years ago 
todays tragedy if it is not stopped tomorrow could turn 
into a national catastrophe said a statement carried by tass and 
broadcast on radio and television 
the statement signed by the communist party central committee 
the presidium of the supreme soviet and the council of ministers 
accused extremists of advocating blind hatred and craziness 
the fighting broke out saturday when azerbaijani mobs attacked 
armenians in the azerbaijan capital baku defense minister dmitri 
t yazov called up the reserves thursday to help cope with the 
fighting which he described as a great disaster 
at least 10500 armenians reportedly have been evacuated from 
baku 
world chess champion garri kasparov said he and his family fled 
the city wednesday by boarding a plane for moscow 
kasparov 26 whose mother is armenian told the spanish 
newspaper el pais in an interview published today that he was 
stunned by the atrocities he had seen 
the government appeal today appeared to conflict with statements 
earlier by premier nikolai i ryzhkov who said the violence was 
decreasing 
ryzhkov spoke on abctvs prime time live broadcast in the 
united states thursday night 
tass said today that the situation in azerbaijan and armenia 
has aggravated in the past 24 hours 
virtually all of baku an oil center of 18 million people was 
on strike to press demands that soviet troops be pulled out of the 
city and local authorities refrain from imposing martial law or a 
curfew said savili peretz deputy director of azerinform the 
azerbaijani news agency 
extremists blockaded the communist party leaderships 
headquarters refusing to allow its staff to enter peretz said in 
a telephone interview from baku he said extremists also blocked 
all the major roads in and around baku 
tass reported rioting on the azerbaijani border with iran and 
peretz said some 31 miles of the border fences had been torn down 
thursday by azerbaijanis who wanted to be united with relatives in 
iran today guards are in control he said 
a journalist with armenias official news agency armenpress 
said four people were killed and 10 wounded early today in an 
azerbaijani attack on the village of yeraskh in the armenian 
republic on the border with the azerbaijani enclave of nakhichevan 
the journalist who asked to remain anonymous said this was the 
first time azerbaijanis had attacked a village in armenia proper 
rather than around the disputed territory of nagornokarabakh 
it was not clear whether the yeraskh casualties were included in 
the latest official death and injury tolls 
in moscow thursday officials announced that reserve troops had 
been called up and that some military units had been put on a 
wartime footing in the embattled region 
gorbachev revealed today that the callup concerned mainly 
reservists in the northern caucasus region and admitted it had 
evoked complaints from the population there 
defense minister yazov said the reinforcements were needed in 
addition to the 29000 already there to maintain order and 
possibly enforce a curfew he did not say how many reserve soldiers 
were called up 
authorities in azerbaijan have refused up to now to impose a 
curfew despite reports of vicious attacks by azerbaijani 
extremists on armenian residents it was not clear whether the 
kremlin intended to impose the curfew in baku and other parts of 
azerbaijan or whether yazov expected the azerbaijani authorities 
to do it 
interior minister vadim bakatin said extremists had obtained 
groundtoground missiles tanks helicopters and other heavy 
weaponry 
foreign reporters have been barred from travel to the republics 
since the latest violence began making it impossible to verify the 
reports on the fighting 
troops already in azerbaijan and the republic of armenia were 
told wednesday they could shoot if necessary to stop the bitter 
fighting in the hills around nagornokarabakh 
tass said officials in nagornokarabakh expanded an existing 
curfew by two hours thursday and the military commandant there 
ordered unregistered organizations dissolved 
however the azerbaijani peoples front which is blamed for 
inciting demonstrations and ignoring calls for restoration of 
order is far more active in other areas of azerbaijan 
yerevan the armenian capital has been running out of fuel 
because of the azerbaijani blockade armenians have countered by 
blockading nakhichevan an azerbaijani enclave inside armenia 
reports said

two young vietnamese refugees facing forced 
repatriation entered the united nations office at their detention 
camp today and attempted suicide a un official said 
they entered the office carrying some kind of sharp objects 
apparently knives and stabbed themselves in the stomach the 
official said 
the two men aged 20 and 25 were rushed to a hospital with 
abdomen injuries a government spokeswoman said one man was 
discharged and the other was in satisfactory condition said the 
spokeswoman on condition of anonymity 
they just walked into the office said they were going to do 
it and did it said anne dawsonshepherd deputy chief of 
mission for the un agency in this british colony i think this 
all happened extremely quickly 
the two boat people had been classified by immigration officers 
as illegal immigrants seeking a better standard of living instead 
of political refugees and their appeal to remain in hong kong was 
denied ms dawsonshepherd said 
a un field assistant and an interpreter were in the office 
during todays incident it occurred at the whitehead detention 
center one of several camps housing a total of 44000 boat people 
who face repatriation against their will unless they can prove they 
fled persecution in their homeland 
also today 100 boat people at the sham shui po detention center 
in kowloon protested being moved to whitehead 
whitehead and the other cramped squalid detention centers have 
been particularly tense since dec 12 when 51 boat people were 
whisked onto an airplane by security forces and forcibly 
repatriated to vietnam 
thousands of vietnamese in hong kong detention centers have 
peacefully protested the forced repatriation policy although 
rioting broke out in one camp when security forces attempted a 
check for homemade weapons 
the governor sir david wilson today said hong kong cannot 
allow boat people to fashion lethal weapons that threaten those 
inside the camps 
we cannot allow violence to become a way of life in the 
camps he said

immigration officials say an increase of 
central americans crossing the border into south texas is straining 
detention centers and has forced the release of hundreds of 
detainees this month 
immigration attorneys and others had speculated that detainees 
were being released because the government expected an influx of 
refugees from wartorn el salvador and nicaragua 
but immigration and naturalization service commissioner gene 
mcnary said thursday in washington that there is no connection 
between anyone who is released and any anticipation of a need for 
space because of the possible influx of central americans 
however he added we would like to have the space to meet 
such an influx if it happens 
we are not going to go over capacity at the detention 
facilities he said during a news conference we are going to 
live within our budget 
illegal immigrants have been detained in south texas while the 
government processes their requests for political asylum 
ins spokesman verne jervis in washington said more than 500 
central americans were apprehended in south texas in the first two 
weeks of january compared to about 500 for all of december 
seasonal factors such as people returning from family visits over 
christmas may account for some of the increase jervis said 
hundreds of detainees were authorized to leave south texas over 
the past two weeks if they can provide a us address where they 
have family and agree to present themselves to the ins office 
nearest their destination 
allowing such travel is a departure from the policy instituted 
last feb 21 after thousands arrived in texas primarily from 
nicaragua and el salvador 
immigrants were prohibited from leaving the area because most 
never reported to immigration officials in other cities instead 
the immigrants were sent to detention camps while their 
applications for asylum were processed 
at one point more than 2400 people were in detention last 
year either awaiting an asylum ruling appealing a ruling or 
awaiting an appearance before an immigration judge 
the law says those without immigration documents may stay if 
they can prove they fled their homelands for political and not 
economic reasons 
there were 1046 detainees primarily central americans at the 
immigration detention center near bayview on thursday another 697 
people were detained thursday in five other facilities in the lower 
rio grande valley 
ins harlingen district director jerry sewell said he was unable 
to elaborate on whether the agency had changed the policy 
prohibiting asylumseekers from leaving south texas unless given

a teenager expelled from a roman catholic high 
school for getting married will be allowed to graduate but she 
will have to do it by mail 
elizabeth valeri will become an extension student of maria 
high school which provides credit for high school correspondence 
courses said a statement released thursday by the 17yearold 
and the school 
courses completed in this manner will enable elizabeth to 
satisfy all requirements for her catholic high school scholastic 
record the statement added 
elizabeth was kicked out of maria when she and her husband 
xavier 20 were pictured in a local newspaper as the first couple 
to marry in cook county in 1990 
the school said earlier that elizabeths marriage outside the 
church and before graduation while not illegal does not 
constitute an appropriate example for other students 
the schools principal sister grace ann said elizabeth knew 
when she wed that she defied a school policy barring married 
students from attending classes 
she would be living a different lifestyle from her classmates 
the principal said after elizabeth was ordered not to attend 
classes but to receive separate tutoring for midterm exams 
elizabeth contended her lifestyle had not changed she said she 
and her husband who were married in a civil ceremony would live 
with their respective parents until their vows were sanctified by 
the church 
the brides attorney robert shindler said earlier this month 
that the policy represented discrimination on the basis of 
marital status 
he threatened a lawsuit unless his client received a written 
apology was allowed to graduate and was readmitted to classes 
were glad we could reach this settlement and that its over 
and she can go on enjoying her family and her friends and her 
17yearolds life shindler said by telephone 
the statement said neither side would make any further public 
comments on the matter a spokesman for the school didnt return a

imprisoned soul singer james brown 
technically is eligible for a work release program today but he 
wont be released because south carolina authorities have questions 
about his georgia sentence 
back in january he was sentenced in georgia to a total of six 
years and three months which was to run concurrently with his 
south carolina sentence of six years and six months department 
of corrections spokesman francis x archibald said thursday 
when it comes to work release our laws are different and we 
have asked his attorney to get his georgia status clear we havent 
heard back he said 
brown 56 was jailed a year ago today for aggravated assault 
and failing to stop for police he already was on probation for a 
guilty plea involving carrying an unlawful pistol resisting arrest 
and pleading no contest for possession of the hallucinogenic drug 
phencyclidine or pcp 
at this point i really dont have enough information to 
discuss what will happen said browns lawyer buddy dallas of 
thomson ga its just bureaucracy the only way to complicate 
this any more is to get a third state involved in it 
mr brown is in the hands of south carolina officials his 
fate and his future is in the hands of the south carolina 
department of corrections whatever the appropriate officials there 
decide is appropriate will be appropriate and nothing has been 
decided yet not even whether he will get into a work release 
program 
unofficially prison officials say they understand that brown 
will not be eligible for parole in georgia until 1992 if that is 
the case he would not be eligible for work release in south 
carolina until march 
if brown does leave prison on work release it will be for 
daytime hours only for work in south carolina he has been offered 
numerous jobs including one with a columbia trolley company that 
wants to use brown to bring people to concerts at williamsbrice 
stadium

east german communist party factions today 
demanded the partys dissolution and the interim president said 
the prodemocracy opposition should help run the caretaker 
government until elections in may 
several thousand people demonstrated today in the cities of 
leipzig suhl and frankfurt an der oder to press for demands that 
included better education and higher wages the official news 
agency adn said 
the actions came as the bonn government increasingly disturbed 
by the flow of east germans resettling in the west blamed the 
communists for the countrys woes and insisted on eventual german 
unity as the solution 
the developments indicate how difficult east germanys road to 
reform has been since a prodemocracy revolution ousted hardline 
communist leader erich honecker on oct 18 opened the berlin wall 
and set up a coalition government that is trying to lead the 
country until democratic elections are held in may 
interim president manfred gerlach a noncommunist said the 
opposition could take over some of the 16 cabinet seats held by the 
communists or the three christian democratic seats the christian 
democrats have threatened to pull out of the shaky 27member 
coalition goverment of communists and parties that have 
traditionally allied with them 
in a statement released today in east berlin several communist 
party movements demanded the partys uncompromising dissolution 
under public control 
the party whose membership has plunged from 23 million to 14 
million in six months is wracked by internal squabbles 
the delegates to the extraordinary party congress held in 
december should again be summoned to agree to the dissolution 
said the statement carried by adn 
it did not say how many party members supported it but it 
listed seven communist factions 
more than 1800 east germans continue to resettle in west 
germany each day threatening the bonn governments ability to 
feed house and give jobs to the newcomers 
reflecting concern over the instability in east germany west 
german chancellor helmut kohls chief of staff on thursday demanded 
a clear commitment to german unity from the east berlin leadership 
the official rudolf seiters said the communists were 
guilty of a lack of willingness to introduce fundamental 
political and economic reforms 
with every day that passes the chances of a lasting recovery 
of the economy in the gdr east germany worsen seiters said 
this is due to the fact that the highly qualified manpower 
which has left is urgently needed within its own country the last 
thing which the gdr can now afford is further bloodletting 
the more than 340000 east germans who have resettled in west 
germany are mostly young skilled workers 
strikes and demonstrations have kept up the pressure on the 
communist premier hans modrows government while boosting the 
leverage of opposition forces 
in order to join a caretaker government the opposition has 
demanded participation in overseeing a dismantling of the dreaded 
secret police and a right to speak in parliament negotiators 
quickly approved resolutions backing both demands 
 
modrow appealed to his coalition partners to hold the government 
together until the nations first free elections set for may 
spokesman wolfgang meyer said 
in bonn seiters spelled out west germanys vision of the next 
steps toward a united germany 
he told lawmakers that shortly after the may elections bonn 
will seek a treaty arrangement with east berlin 
the treaty arrangement is the first step toward confederative 
structures which are to lead to a federal structure in germany 
seiters said emphasizing that kohl intends to keep pushing for 
german unity 
this view of unity must be made very clear in the treaty 
that is to be worked out seiters said we hope that a freely 
elected parliament in the german democratic republic will 
strengthen such a view for the solution of the german question and 
thus the goal of german national unity 
modrow himself first called for closer treaty ties although the 
communist premier said he was insisting on an independent east 
german state 
the east german social democrats considered the most likely to 
head the government after the may elections have said they favor 
german unity and want to start talks on the issue as soon as 
possible following the vote

the sister of one of the hostages being held 
in lebanon says government officials tell her americans dont care 
about the captives fate but she disagrees 
two words i have come to hate are political expediency 
peggy say the sister of hostage terry anderson told newspaper 
editors at a meeting of the north carolina associated press 
thursday 
i have been told numerous times that people just dont care 
but i am convinced that the only ones who dont care are the ones 
who dont know about them she said 
anderson the chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press was kidnapped on march 16 1985 he was last seen in a 
videotaped message to his family in october 1988 
i have no reason to believe since a year ago last october that 
terry anderson is alive but im counting on him to be she said 
you cant live without hope and a little bit of faith in my 
government that they are trying to bring these hostages out 
mrs say who has made several trips to the middle east seeking 
the release of her brother said families of the hostages want the 
government to use positive pressure to work for the release of 
the eight americans still held in lebanon 
although the government has a policy against negotiating with 
terrorists mrs say said that did not stop negotiations for the 
release of hijacked airline passengers and the achille lauro cruise 
ship 
the hostages location may be a secret she added but there is 
little mystery about who is holding them and that iran is behind 
those terrorists 
i know who terry andersons guards are what their names are 
and where they live she said 
she said released hostages have told her that guards hold guns 
to the heads of the captives every time there is a knock on the 
door a rescue attempt would lead to the hostages deaths she 
feels 
terry told one of the hostages later released that he hadnt 
gone through all this to die in a rescue attempt mrs say said 
what its going to take is governmenttogovernment discussions

president bush is trying to blunt the momentum 
of a politically appealing plan to cut social security taxes 
arguing it would force either an increase in other taxes or a 
reduction in retirement benefits 
bush called the proposal a charade thursday vice president 
dan quayle said it was a political trap and a subterfuge for 
a general tax increase 
the target of the white house attack was a proposal by sen 
daniel patrick moynihan dny to roll back the social security 
payroll tax increase that began jan 1 
moynihans plan has put bush on the spot because it has won 
support across the political spectrum even from traditional allies 
of the president such as the us chamber of commerce and 
conservative groups 
moreover it has exposed bush to criticism that he is espousing 
a tax cut for the rich with a proposed cut in capital gains taxes 
while spurning a break for middle and lowincome americans with a 
reduction in social security taxes 
senate majority leader george mitchell said today that he 
believes moynihans proposal dramatized inequities and 
regressiveness in the american tax system but he stopped short 
of endorsing it 
the maine democrat said he has asked staff aides to study the 
budgetary impact of rolling back the social security payroll tax 
and said he would not make a decision on whether to support the 
bill until he has seen the results of the studies and has discussed 
the issue with moynihan 
bush in his first comments on the proposal said this is an 
effort to get me to try to raise taxes on the american people by 
the charade of cutting them or cut benefits 
and i am not going to do it to the older people in this 
country bush pledged 
on the heels of moynihans measure sen ernest f hollings 
dsc proposed a 5 percent valueadded tax a national sales 
levy to replace revenues lost by the social security tax cut and 
bushs own proposal to lower the tax on capital gains 
hollings plan would raise 53 billion in 1991 
quayle said hollings proposal was proof that a tax increase 
would be the result of reducing social security taxes 
the cats a little bit out of the bag right now the vice 
president said in an interview with the associated press 
however moynihan was quoted in todays editions of the new york 
times as saying it is not fair to say i want to raise taxes to 
offset the social security tax cut 
he said the social security system edges on the sacred and to 
see its revenues debauched this way is an independent question that 
stands apart from the budget deficit a tax increase or any other 
question 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater lumping the 
moynihan and hollings proposals together said first we had the 
tax cut and now we have the tax increase can cuts in benefits be 
far behind 
moynihans proposal would save workers 7 billion in social 
security taxes this year and 55 billion in fiscal 1991 
the payroll tax paid by both employers and employees rose to 
765 percent jan 1 from 751 percent and it is levied on wages up 
to 51300 instead of 48000 that means a wageearner could pay 
as much as 3924 in social security taxes this year an increase 
of about 319 from 1989 
moynihan argues that the payroll tax should be reduced because 
mounting surpluses in the social security trust funds are being 
used to help offset large budget deficits instead of being put away 
for future retirement benefits 
the surpluses are the result of a 1983 agreement between the 
reagan administration and congress in which taxes were raised to 
build up a pool of hundreds of billions of dollars to pay for baby 
boomers retirement costs in the next century 
moynihans administrative assistant paul browne said bush was 
engaging in a scare tactic 
the notion that a payroll tax cut in any way hurts 
recipients is nonsense thats just flat wrong browne said 
quayle said moynihans proposal gives republicans their first 
opportunity to appear as the protector of social security 
let me tell you something cut these taxes the way that 
moynihan is talking about you have to cut benefits at some time 
and the president and the republican party now have an opportunity 
to show the american people once and for all that the republicans 
are as committed to the integrity of this social security trust 
fund as anybody quayle said

republican national chairman lee atwater 
advised gop candidates today to face the abortion issue squarely 
without vacillation waffling or doubletalk saying voters will 
accept differences but not ducking 
in 1990 no candidate can run for office without squarely 
facing the abortion issue atwater told the winter meeting of the 
republican national committee 
president bush the party platform and atwater all are firm 
opponents of abortion but the gop chairman said that doesnt mean 
all republican candidates have to agree 
there is no litmus test on any issue which would be grounds 
for repudiating a republican who believes in our overall philosophy 
atwater said 
the issue figured in republican defeats for two governorships in 
1989 and ever since atwater has been telling his party that its 
candidates must stake out their own positions clearly and early 
otherwise he said democrats will define the issue in their terms 
what no voter likes is vacillation waffling or doubletalk 
atwater said today and they dont like the appearance of 
vacillation waffling or doubletalk 
he said the republican party is big enough to accommodate 
different views saying that is one of the growing pains involved 
in becoming a majority 
atwater and other republican leaders have been recommending that 
handling of the abortion issue ever since the defeats of 1989 
vice president dan quayle said thursday that people on all sides 
of the abortion issue can be comfortable in the republican party 
but there was a distinct level of discomfort at the national 
committee meeting 
idaho republican chairman randy ayre was swiftly rebuffed 
thursday when he tried to get the party to adopt a resolution 
reaffirming the 1988 gop platform stance in opposition to abortion 
republicans are trying to cope with a turnaround in the impact 
of the issue after a decade in which the antiabortion stance was 
ascendant and candidates espousing prochoice views were on the 
defensive 
but prochoice activists were energized by a supreme court 
ruling last summer that opened the way for states to enact 
restrictions on access to abortions 
in an interview in his white house office quayle reaffirmed his 
support for the 1988 platform but then added that republicans are 
a party of inclusion the tent is big enough to include prolife 
as well as prochoice 
the president has already campaigned for a number of 
prochoice senate candidates he will continue to support the 
republican candidate no matter whether prolife or prochoice 
quayle said 
despite the 1989 election results president bush has maintained 
a strong antiabortion position vetoing two bills that would have 
allowed the use of federal funds for abortions in cases of rape and 
incest 
quayle said that on abortion the gop was becoming more like 
the traditional democratic party that is that we are inclusive 
rather than exclusive i have a hunch the democratic party really 
runs the risk of being more singleissue than the republican 
party 
the vice president added that prochoice republicans dont 
feel uncomfortable in our party if they do they shouldnt 
when ayre offered his resolution he was told that his request 
would not be considered because he had not submitted a formal 
resolution in advance of the gathering and that perhaps the issue 
would be discussed at the next rnc meeting in june 
but we have elections coming up he told the rncs 
resolutions committee 
after the session ayre said that while he personally opposes 
abortion and believes the party should too he did not believe the 
gop should not use a candidates position on abortion as a litmus 
test for party support 
i just feel that we should reaffirm the partys longstanding 
position on the issue he said 
but one rnc member speaking on condition of anonymity said 
party officials were reluctant to stir new interest in an issue 
that could hurt many gop candidates in the 1990 elections 
those who are prolife can point to the 1988 platform and 
those prochoice can point to the presidents remarks about 
inclusion he said it does us no good to stir this thing up

the navy says arson is suspected in a 
fire aboard the aircraft carrier uss forrestal that injured 11 
sailors and caused an estimated 25 million in damage a newspaper 
reported today 
most logically the fire was intentionally set said the 
report which was obtained by the florida timesunion in a freedom 
of information act request 
but navy investigators have not determined who set the fire 
which occurred oct 9 while the ship was docked at mayport naval 
station northeast of jacksonville they said they found no 
evidence that it started accidentally 
investigators also said materials used to clean up a fuel spill 
from the carrier four days earlier were improperly stored on the 
ship 
no arrests have been made and the navy investigation is 
continuing 
the fire broke out three days before the forrestal was to leave 
on a sixmonth deployment to the mediterranean repairs delayed the 
start of the deployment until nov 3 
a navy spokesman in washington lt frank thorp said he could 
not speculate on whether the fire could have been set in an attempt 
to delay the ships departure 
the fire started in an air intake in the ships no 1 main 
machinery room on the second deck fueled by the oilcleanup 
material the fire spread through electrical cable to an aircraft 
elevator machinery room then ignited a fire off one of the 
carriers hangar bays 
smoke spread through the carrier forcing the evacuation of 
1000 sailors 
the fire affected some navigation aircraft elevator control and 
weapons systems components and left some parts of the ship without

the government today dismissed as 
untruthful an amnesty international report that accused south 
korean authorities of torturing prisoners and committing other 
human rights violations 
in a statement the government said the londonbased human 
rights organization has naively taken at face value onesided and 
often malicious assertions 
amnesty internationals report on human rights violations last 
year in south korea contained serious factual errors unrealistic 
assertions and suggestions which disregard the nations legal 
system it said the statement called the allegations 
untruthful 
in its report amnesty international said torture and other 
violations under the government of president roh taewoo last year 
had reversed a twoyear trend of human rights improvements in south 
korea 
the human rights group also said 800 political and labor 
activists have been arrested in a crackdown on political opposition 
by rohs government and thousands more briefly detained for 
particiaption in demonstrations and industrial strikes 
hundreds of prisoners were believed being held for political 
reasons at the end of 1989 and another 200 political prisoners 
have been held for between one and 39 years amnesty said 
the government maintained south korea has no prisoners of 
conscience and only those who threatened the rule of law and 
national survival by willfully violating the established law have 
been imprisoned 
amnesty internationals arbitrary definition of them as 
prisoners of conscience who must be released can only be deemed to 
be based on an ignorance or misunderstanding of the facts it 
said 
roh has introduced broad reforms since he took office but last 
year his government began taking firm action against radical 
students and dissidents public support for the radicals has waned 
because of their ideological extremism and violent tactics

the main exit from panama is not the 
swiftest 
nearly a month after us troops invaded the country security 
at panamas airport befits more a prison than a way station for 
international flights 
the omar torrijos international airport is for all practical 
purposes closed to the public it belongs to us troops armored 
cars tanks german shepherds and other bombsniffing creatures 
the obstacle course includes more than the usual metal detectors 
and document checks for one passenger it included getting by an 
incontinent dog 
the planes do take off but passengers are advised to check in 
at least five hours before departure if not too bad you may miss 
your flight 
most top aides and officers to gen manuel antonio noriega 
toppled after the dec 20 invasion are believed to have 
surrendered or sought asylum in various foreign embassies in panama 
city 
but some noriega cronies are still on the loose and us forces 
arent taking any chances that theyll slip out of the country 
carrying a boarding pass 
weve gotten most of the defense forces but not all said 
army col james swank spokesman for the us southern command 
among the top members of noriegas defense forces still on the 
lam is lt col luis cordoba the former police intelligence head 
linked to the grisly 1985 murder of noriega opponent hugo 
spadafora whose headless body was found in costa rica 
the capital is rife with rumors that cordoba has taken to the 
mountains to wage a guerrilla war against us troops and the new 
government of president guillermo endara 
cordoba might also be in hiding but if hes waiting for an 
airplane hes out of luck 
an airline passenger cant just drive to the airport park the 
car and check in at the counter 
at least five hours before the plane takes off travelers are 
told to be at the huge pink atlapa convention center 15 miles from 
the airport where tickets passports and visas are checked 
if all the information fits with rosters and computer lists the 
travelers get a boarding card and a luggage ticket stub 
then theyre told to wait for a bus that will drive them to 
airport at a cost of 5 
the airports entrance is sealed off with sandbags barbed wire 
and tanks before the bus is allowed in a soldier hops on and 
inspects passports and tickets 
if there are no suspicious characters the bus can go in 
dont get off the bus yet stay inside until we tell you to 
a panamanian woman admonishes impatient travelers 
the luggage is taken off and lined up neatly next to a door 
then and only then passengers can step down one by one they pick 
out their suitcases not more than two are allowed per passenger 
and there are no porters 
step 1 passenger and suitcase go through metal detector and 
xray 
step 2 suitcases are lined in a row and opened passengers sit 
down and watch 
step 3 dog no 1 sniffs each suitcase and purse 
step 4 dog no 2 sniffs the same suitcases again 
step 5 panamanian security guard goes through each suitcase 
with hands 
step 6 passengers try to close suitcase back up 
the procedure is not always smooth one dog decides to do more 
than sniff and urinates on a suitcase full of photography 
chemicals the us k9 officer merely yanks the dogs chain and 
sets it to sniffing again 
amid raucous laughter the dog male starts paying more 
attention to a fellow security dog female 
im never coming back to panama as long as i live says a 
honduran woman looking on 
the luggage then goes on the plane but not the passenger 
first a 15 airport tax must be paid then exit visas are 
checked at another glass booth visas passports ticket and 
boarding pass are rechecked 
the worst is over one more xray one more metal detector 
soldiers with machine guns and dogs on leashes mingle with 
passengers until the plane can be boarded 
but even after everyone is on board the checks go on 
outside an officiallooking man talks with the crew and boards 
the plane 
a passenger is told come with me please 
before the plane can take off his luggage must be removed from 
the cargo bay that takes 45 minutes

two former cincinnati bell telephone co 
installers have failed to support their accusations that the 
company engaged in illegal wiretapping cincinnati bells attorney 
argued today 
lawyer arnold morelli said leonard gates and robert draise had 
changed their stories forgotten key dates and bumped into 
facts during their testimony alleging two company supervisors and 
police directed them to install wiretaps 
no corroboration nobody supports their stories morelli 
told the jury in closing arguments it is all a figment of their 
imaginations 
morelli also noted that the former employees declined to take 
lie detector tests while the company supervisors peter gabor 
and james west voluntarily submitted to the examinations 
gates and draise say the company is trying to cover up that they 
were ordered to perform 1200 wiretaps between 1972 and 1984 at 
first for cincinnati police and later by cincinnati bell 
supervisors 
the company denies any involvement with illegal wiretaps and 
filed a defamation lawsuit against gates and draise 
hamilton county common pleas judge fred j cartolano planned to 
instruct the jury on the law after gates and draise completed their 
closing arguments today closing arguments in the eightweek trial 
began thursday 
as he did throughout the trial morelli on thursday emphasized 
the employees inconsistencies and discrepancies morelli said 
gates has changed his story three times about which supervisor 
supposedly ordered him to tap the phone of president ford during a 
1975 visit to cincinnati 
a liar has to have a terrific memory morelli said to 
attempt to establish lies takes a lot of time and a lot of work 
they have been inconsistent and they have contradicted 
themselves 
gates and draise are defending themselves in the defamation 
trial draise told jurors in closing arguments thursday that they 
must find in the employees favor to prevent companies from 
retaliating against whistleblowers 
you have the ability to send bell and other companies a 
message were not going to stand for it draise said 
gates admitted thursday that his memory about the years of 
supposed wiretaps is hazy but he said anyone would have trouble 
remembering such details many years later he also said cincinnati 
bell had only complimentary things to say about him in his work 
appraisals before he went public with the wiretap allegations 
look through my appraisals gates told the jurors in 23 
years cincinnati bell has never called me a liar 
cincinnati bell contends that gates and draise lied to get 
revenge against the company because gates was fired in 1986 and 
draise in 1979 cincinnati bell its parent cincinnati bell inc 
and two of the phone companys managers james west and peter 
gabor sued to challenge the wiretapping claims gates and draise 
countersued saying they were injured because cincinnati bell 
officials called them liars 
cartolano on wednesday dismissed the defamation lawsuit that 
gates and draise filed against cincinnati bell the jury now must 
decide only the original lawsuit the company filed against the two 
former installers

the boeing co plans to reduce its seattlearea 
work force by 5000 people this year although the company has 
record orders for commercial jets with deliveries stretching into 
the next century 
better eastwest relations have cast doubt on the future of 
boeings defense business and fewer production workers are needed 
on the companys 747400 jumbo jets boeing officials said thursday 
boeing wants to build a new widebody jet the 777 but no orders 
have been announced and production startup is at least two years 
away 
the aerospace giant said it hopes to accomplish half the cuts 
through retirement and resignations 
the martin marietta astronautics group also announced plans 
thursday to cut about 200 jobs by the end of february but will 
transfer many workers to other posts within the aerospace giant a 
company spokeswoman said in denver 
positions that cannot be directly tied to a contract will be 
affected and will be eliminated possibly through a combination of 
fulltime and parttime jobs said spokeswoman judy stowell 
a review of business propects for 1990 showed the company needed 
to cut overhead labor costs stowell said the company employes 
about 11500 workers in colorado and other martin divisions employ 
3600 workers 
boeings announcement came about two months after the company 
and union workers settled a 48day strike which was mainly over 
wages and mandatory overtime about 43000 seattle area union 
workers were affected by the strike 
boeing said it will give layoff notices today to about 1900 
employees who might be among some 1700 workers who will lose jobs 
starting march 20 the balance of the workers are to be laid off 
later in the year 
boeing has a backlog of more than 1700 commercial jets worth 
about 85 billion last year it added 10000 employees in the 
puget sound area and was so strapped for production workers on its 
747400 that it borrowed 600 machinists from lockheed 
that startup and certification work has been completed and the 
extra workers are no longer needed boeing said delays and 
uncertainties on other projects especially defense work mean the 
lost jobs cannot be absorbed elsewhere in the company it said 
about 1400 of the 1700 hourly employees to be laid off are at 
the companys everett plant north of seattle where widebody 747s 
and 767s are built most of the others probably will be defense 
workers boeing spokesman paul binder said 
thursdays announcement didnt mention possible job losses at 
boeing plants outside the puget sound region 
the company has a large military and commercial plant at 
wichita kan a helicopter division at philadelphia a space 
center at huntsville ala and smaller operations scattered 
throughout the country 
at year end boeing had just under 106700 employees in 
washington state nationwide its employment had grown to 145200 
up 10800 from the beginning of the year

the bhagwan shree rajneesh the guru who 
drew thousands of followers to central oregon by preaching a blend 
of eastern religion pop psychology and free love died today of 
heart failure his spokesman said he was 58 
rajneesh known as osho rajneesh in recent years died at his 
commune in the southern city of poona where he settled after being 
deported from the united states in 1985 
osho left his body at 530 pm the doctors say its heart 
failure spokesman swami chaitanya kirti said in a telephone 
interview disciples carried rajneeshs body on their shoulders to 
a funeral pyre built on a nearby riverbank and it was cremated 
kirti said 
i dont think i ever wish anybody dead but i wished many 
times that he would go back where he belongs said jean opray 
former mayor of the town of antelope ore which was taken over 
for a time by rajneeshs followers 
kirti said the guru had greeted followers wednesday in the 
buddha hall his indian communes main prayer center but did not 
appear thursday because of pain on the left side of his chest 
about 10000 followers mostly westerners were at the poona 
commune when rajneesh died kirti said another of rajneeshs 
followers swami prabhod said the devotees burst into songs and 
chants to celebrate rajneeshs departure from his earthly body 
everybody is singing and celebrating prabhod said music 
could be heard in the background as he spoke over the telphone from 
poona 750 miles southwest of new delhi 
as the bhagwan a hindi word for god rajneesh presided 
over a 64000acre commune 120 miles east of portland ore from 
1981 until 1985 when he pled guilty to violating federal 
immigration laws 
in its heyday the commune known as rajneeshpuram was home to 
4000 redclad followers who toiled 12 hours a day and showered 
rajneesh with jewels and rollsroyces that he used for daily drives 
past lines of singing clapping fans 
in the orange book which contains the gurus teachings 
rajneesh advocated dynamic mediation 
explode go totally mad jump up and down shouting the 
mantra hoo hoo hoo each time you land on the flats of your 
feet let the sound hammer deep into the sex center he wrote 
the crowd at the commune swelled to 15000 during summer 
festivals and residents of nearby communities resented the 
intrusion rajneeshs top aide was eventually convicted in an 
elaborate scheme designed to gain political control of the county 
rajneesh pleaded guilty in november 1985 to two counts of 
violating immigration laws by arranging sham marriages to help his 
foreign disciples remain in the united states illegally 
under a plea agreement 33 other counts were dropped rajneesh 
received a suspended 10year sentence paid a 400000 fine and 
agreed not to return to the united states for five years without 
the written permission of the us attorney general 
he took his throne with him when he left 
rajneesh returned to india but left after a month when the 
government deported 10 of his aides 
for six months he roamed the world in search of a home but was 
turned away by 21 countries in july 1986 he returned to indian 
and set up a commune 
his headquarters in poona were far humbler than the sprawling 
ranch in the sagebrush dotted hills of central oregons high 
desert in poona rajneesh was reduced to a sixacre commune 
in december 1988 rajneesh traded the hindu honorific of bhagwan 
for osho a buddhist term that means on whom the heavens shower 
flowers 
rajneesh had reversed his free love preaching in recent years 
because of the danger of aids 
he had been in failing health since leaving the united states 
and often claimed that us officials poisoned him while he was in 
jail 
the lavish oregon commune which included orchards a vineyard 
a 65acre vegetable farm two lakes stocked with fish and an 
airport with a 4500foot paved runway is now deserted an 
insurance company foreclosed on the property but never found a 
buyer 
bernard smith district attorney of oregons wasco county said 
today that rajneeshs death marks the end of what was a pretty 
unpleasant experience for most of us here 
rajneeshpuram was incorporated as a city on part of the commune 
in 1982 disciples also moved into antelope a nearby town of 40 
people eventually holding all its elected offices and chaning its 
name to city of rajneesh 
the antelope name was restored in 1985 at rajneeshs suggestion 
in an effort to make peace with oregonians 
rajneeshs utopia began to unravel in september 1985 when the 
gurus personal secretary ma anand sheela abruptly left 
in october of that year rajneesh and sheela were arrested the 
guru was taken into custody when two jets taking him to bermuda 
were surrounded at the charlotte nc airport 
sheela fled to west germany and was brought back to the united 
states she pleaded guilty to a variety of charges including 
attempting to murder the gurus personal physician with a 
poisonfilled syringe 
she also admitted orchestrating a food poisoning outbreak at 
restaurants in the dalles the county seat as part of a plot aimed 
at gaining political control of the county 
sheela was sentenced to 4 years in prison and ordered to be 
deported when her sentence was served 
rajneeshs body attired in the gurus customary flowing robes 
and diamondstudded cap was taken to the buddha hall three hours 
after death and was heaped with roses rajneeshs favorite flowers 
kirti said 
there was no incense fixed because he hated its smell he 
added

the medellin cartel released a hostage 
with a message for president bush pledging to end the drug trade 
but the white house today said the message would not persuade it to 
deal with drug lords 
our position is still the same said white house secretary 
marlin fitzwater in washington we have traditionally been 
opposed to deals with the cartel essentially its a matter for 
colombia to deal with 
the cartel released the hostage thursday and two other hostages 
on wednesday and in a communique it acknowledged defeat to the 
government it offered to stop its activities in exchange for an 
amnesty 
the cocaine lords have made such promises before and major 
newspapers and the government called for the war against drugs to 
continue 
in their message to bush on thursday the extraditables a group 
representing the medellin cartel said we are going to release 
all of our hostages the groups name refers to drug suspects the 
united states wants extradited to face charges 
the extraditables have kidnapped 85 people in the last 45 days 
authorities estimate at least 18 remain in the hands of the cartel 
the message was repeated from memory by roberto toro gonzalez 
who was kidnapped on dec 14 toro gonzalez 23 son of a wealthy 
family that owns a chain of stores said in a radio interview his 
captors made him memorize the message before chaining him to the 
window grating of a house in medellin 
journalists from colombias two major radio networks caracol 
and rcn were tipped off by anonymous phone callers and arrived at 
the scene shortly after toro gonzalezs captors drove off 
in their message the extraditables asked bush to take them at 
their word 
if president bush and the men of the us drug 
enforcement administration do not believe the word of drug 
traffickers why do they negotiate with them and why do they let 
them testify against other suspects the message asked 
the cartel apparently was referring to pleabargaining 
agreements often made between drug suspects and us authorities 
on wednesday the cartel freed patricia echavarria the sister 
of president virgilio barcos soninlaw and her daughter the 
two kidnapped in medellin dec 16 carried the communique from the 
traffickers conceding defeat 
leading politicians said the struggle was almost over 
two liberal party presidential candidates ernesto samper and 
william jaramillo said in declarations published thursday in the 
daily el tiempo that the offensive had pushed traffickers into an 
unconditional surrender 
their optimism was shared by medellin mayor juan gomez who has 
repeatedly called for negotiations with the medellin cartel el 
tiempo quoted gomez as saying the traffickers concession of defeat 
was an important step toward peace 
but in its lead editorial el tiempo said the drug war had not 
ended although the government offensive was working 
since barco ordered his crackdown in midaugust authorities 
have extradited 13 drug suspects to the united states the 
traffickers responded with a terror campaign that killed 209 
people including 107 who died when a bombed jet crashed outside 
bogota in november 
authorities also killed a leader of the medellin cartel gonzalo 
rodriguez gacha in a gunfight 
after the traffickers conceded defeat wednesday interior 
minister carlos lemos simmonds said the government would not be 
tricked into ending its antidrug offensive he also said that 
under no circumstances would the government negotiate with 
traffickers or drop the policy of extraditing suspects to the 
united states

valentino king of italian couture has turned 
mentor and benefactor 
beginning this spring his accademia valentino a former school 
of theology off the spanish steps in downtown rome will have art 
exhibits concerts and other cultural activities 
all proceeds from these events which will also include private 
fashion shows will go to charity mainly aids research and care of 
aids victims 
to inaugurate this philanthropic phase valentino invited 
actress elizabeth taylor chairman of the american foundation for 
aids research to be guest of honor at a cocktail party for 1000 
of rome high society friends 
at the soiree he gave a preview of his springsummer 1990 high 
fashion collection that will be presented in paris later this month 
apparently tired from the days activities which included a 
visit to a home for aids victims ms taylor wearing an aubergine 
blue evening gown adorned with a diamond brooch stayed at the 
party just long enough thursday evening to be photographed with the 
designer and then disappeared 
the disappointed guests who were hoping for a closer look at the 
actress were left with a glimpse at the new collection as well as 
his first art exhibit 30 paintings and sculptures of the 20th 
century scuola romana that will travel to moscow later this 
year 
if valentinos debut in americanstyle fundraising is the good 
news the bad news is that the golden boy of italian couture is 
abandoning the roman runway and moving to paris 
already a year ago valentino rocked the couture crowd by 
showing his new collection not only in rome but also in paris he 
repeated this double feature fashion show in the summer 
citing dwindling international interest in the rome couture 
scene indifference of roman authorities to support the fashion 
world the french chambre syndicale supports parisian fashion both 
morally and financially and the general state of confusion of 
rome as it prepares to host the world cup soccer championships this 
summer valentino said it was not worth his while to show in rome 
he promises however to keep rome as his headquarters and does 
not rule out a return on the runway the future he has been showing 
his readytowear collection exclusively in paris for over a decade 
what little romans did see of the collection was beautiful 
harking back to his famous white collection in florence that 
marked the beginning of his success story almost 30 years ago 
valentino presented 19 white silk gowns and suits adorned with tiny 
pleats ruffles and a myriad of large mother of pearl and gold 
buttons 
the models stood in static positions as if at a party in one 
of the reception rooms of the palazzo as the crowd filed past 
valentino is not alone in questioning the validity of the rome 
fashion week that used to draw the international press and jet set 
twice a year when such names as biki sorelle fontana fabiani and 
capucci dictated italian fashion mores 
several years ago rome fashion got a boost when milanese 
designer gianfranco ferre chose the capital to present his couture 
collection but last summer ferre was lured to paris to become 
designer for the famed house of dior 
other top names such as balestra and barocco have also 
threatened to abandon ship if rome authorities do not give them a 
good reason to stay 
in general the new look for springsummer 1990 shown in rome 
this week is demure and romantic colors are springtime pastels 
and faded floral prints the favorite fabric is silk chiffon and 
ruffles and pleats abound models wear delicate makeup and long 
wavy hairstyles 
most successful at this new look and so far loyal to the roman 
runway was mila schoen with a series of garden party silk gowns in 
floral chiffon prints with broad brimmed straw hats adorned with 
matching silk flowers 
in response to the cries for help from the rome fashion crowd 
new mayor franco carraro has promised to meet with leaders of the 
italian chamber of fashion to see what can be done to boost italian 
couture and keep the madeinitaly label firmly rooted in the 
eternal city

premier li peng on friday signed new regulations 
governing foreign journalists in china the official xinhua news 
agency said but it did not disclose their contents 
foreign journalists were under tight restrictions in beijing 
during nearly eight months of martial law that ended jan 11 the 
new regulations are expected to reimpose at least some of those 
restrictions 
the state council chinas cabinet approved them on the same 
day that martial law ended xinhua said the regulations were 
necessary to supervise the activities of foreign journalists and 
resident foreign news organizations 
the foreign ministry has refused to divulge their contents and 
xinhua did not say if they take effect with lis signing 
under martial law foreign journalists were banned from 
conducting interviews without army approval all interview requests 
had to be submitted to the city government and weeks often passed 
before a response was made usually negative 
the government expelled two foreign reporters based in beijing 
following its june 34 army crackdown on prodemocracy protesters 
and half a dozen visiting journalists police surveillance of 
journalists including audible telephone bugs increased sharply 
during the summer but appears to have relaxed recently 
information continues to be hard to get however because many 
chinese officials consider it politically risky to grant interviews 
the beijing city government meanwhile approved a regulation 
forbidding books magazines and audio or videotapes that violate 
the fundamental principles of the constitution are pornographic 
superstititious or contain other evils 
it reiterated that all book magazine newspaper and tape 
sellers must be officially licensed a requirement that has been 
widely ignored in the past 
authorities nationwide have conducted an intensive campaign 
since june against pornographic and politically suspect materials 
they have raided book stalls burned tens of thousands of books and 
magazines and shut down many book distributors and several 
publishing companies

a landing eastern airlines jet tore the top off a 
twinengine plane that touched down just before it killing one 
person aboard the smaller aircraft officials said 
none of the 149 people on the jet was injured in the accident on 
a runway at hartsfield atlanta international airport at 715 pm 
thursday an eastern spokesman said the spokesman said a wing was 
damaged on the jet a boeing 727 
the collision involved eastern flight 111 which originated in 
montreal and stopped in new york and a twinengine beechcraft king 
air 100 flying from a suburban airport a second person aboard the 
beechcraft was injured 
both planes had been cleared to land federal aviation 
administration spokesman jack barker said 
asked if that indicated a problem in the control tower he 
replied thats under investigation 
obviously something went wrong for two airplanes to hit each 
other on the runway barker said everything involving the 
movement of those two aircraft will be considered by federal 
investigators 
national transportation safety board investigators from 
washington arrived today spokeswoman drucella andersen said they 
would question witnesses including the eastern crew and the 
smaller planes injured copilot and would examine air traffic 
control tapes and easterns operating procedures 
under aircraft approach rules the arriving aircraft cannot be 
cleared to land until the preceding aircraft has left the runway 
ms andersen said we wont speculate as to what this might mean 
i cant tell you what the cause is 
roger myers another faa spokesman said the eastern plane was 
completing its landing as the beechcraft still was taxiing on the 
runway 
the eastern airliner landed behind him and they collided on 
the runway myers said he the eastern pilot was on his 
landing roll meaning the jet was still rolling to a stop 
barker said officials did not know how much time lapsed between 
the two plane landings although it was very close between the 
two 
it isnt unusual for planes to land within two minutes of each 
other at hartsfield which was the worlds busiest airport in 1987 
and ranked third last year according to faa figures the airport 
averaged 75 landings an hour on two runways in 1987 an airport 
spokesman said then 
it was the first pilot death at hartsfield since three delta air 
lines crew members were killed in a 1958 accident said hartsfield 
spokeswoman rhonda copenny she said the huge airport has never had 
a passenger fatality 
gene griffin an eastern passenger from new york said the 
plane veered to the left and hit something i thought maybe it was 
a pothole no one was really sure what was going on but no one was 
really hurt or shaken up 
those who witnessed the collision described it much differently 
i seen this debris flying everywhere terrible just like it 
flipped over and it was way up in the air terrible said rodney 
johnson an airport ground worker 
airport spokesman john braden said the jet coasted 2000 feet 
before stopping 
the runway where the crash occurred was closed until national 
transportation safety board investigators would let airport workers 
move the wreckage probably sometime today braden said operations 
continued normally on the other runways 
there was a little rain and fog at the time of the collision 
but it was not bad weather braden said he said he had not 
talked to controllers in the tower about what might have happened 
the beechcraft was owned by epps air service and based at dekalb 
peachtree airport on the edge of atlanta the two men aboard the 
plane were epps employees braden said 
the top half of the plane was pretty well sheared off the 
engines are intact braden said the tail section also was 
missing 
killed was eric thomas 30 of acworth ga and injured was 
daniel olthoff 26 of norcross ga said officials at the 
hospital where both were taken olthoff was described as 
conscious alert and talking 
passengers on the eastern flight are ok no injuries said 
eastern spokesman robin matell in miami 
matell said the flight was carrying 141 passengers and a crew of 
eight atlanta was its final destination matell said the eastern 
planes captain whose name was not released had 23 years 
experience with the company

himself a new custombuilt yacht thats bigger than a football 
field and fitted with a roman bath and amphitheater 
billionaire donald trump plans to treat himself to just that

mayor marion barry arrested on a charge of 
possessing crack cocaine postponed indefinitely today announcement 
of his candidacy for a fourth term city hall sources said 
elected officials and politicians were describing the mayors 
arrest as a crippling blow to his reelection bid already facing 
several challengers and the formidable shadow of jesse jackson 
word of the postponement of barrys announcement which had been 
scheduled for sunday came from top city officials who spoke only 
on condition they not be identified 
jackson was in chicago his only comment on the arrest was to 
say he was stunned the twotime presidential candidate 
established residence in the nations capital last year and has 
held a wide lead in opinion polls over all other potential mayoral 
candidates 
but jackson had said he would not challenge barry an old friend 
from thir days in the civil rights movement in recent weeks 
sources close to jackson had described him as backing away from a 
mayoral bid 
barry 53 was arrested on a narcotics charge thursday night in 
what federal authorities described as an ongoing public 
corruption probe he was charged with one count of cocaine 
possession a misdemeanor 
a federal law enforcement source said authorities had a 
videotape of barry smoking crack cocaine at a downtown hotel barry 
has long denied rumors that he uses drugs 
politically i think he is finished said julius hobson 
formerly the citys chief lobbyist on capitol hill and now an aide 
to sen charles robb dva this charge apparently with audio 
and video evidence is political evidence that you cannot 
overcome 
hobson added this may well be the opening that many of us 
have speculated jesse was looking for he has said he would never 
run against marion and now that problem may have been solved for 
him 
walter fauntroy washingtons elected nonvoting member of 
congress said he was in shock the shock that comes to any 
family member who has been told repeatedly by somebody he cares 
about that he is not using drugs and finds out thats not the 
case 
rep stan parris rva ranking republican on the house 
committee on the district of columbia said barry should 
temporarily turn over his mayoral duties to another city official 
while the case is pending 
ron brown the national chairman of the democratic party called 
the arrest troubling news brown said in a statement issued by 
his office that barry is entitled to his day in court and i 
believe that a discussion of the political options for the district 
of columbia should not interfere with the legal process 
browns counterpart republican chairman lee atwater declined 
comment when asked about barrys arrest as did william bennett 
president bushs federal drug policy coordinator 
even before thursday nights arrest barrys chances of winning 
reelection appeared shaky as the drug use accusations mounted the 
citys homicide rate continued breaking records and barry battled 
claims of fiscal mismanagement in 1986 he faced only token 
democratic opposition in his reelection bid this time around 
four democrats so far said they would run against him 
barry elected in 1978 as the citys second mayor under home 
rule said as recently as friday that he has been the victim of 
character assassination 
the arrest certainly is going to put a damper on his campaign 
if indeed there is a campaign said attorney max berry who 
directed barrys 1986 reelection effort but has since soured on 
the mayor if there is any good to come from this maybe we will 
look inside ourselves find better candidates for office and demand 
more of them 
gregory e mize general counsel to the dc council said that 
by law the mayor can keep his office even though he has been 
arrested however mize said that if barry were convicted and 
incarcerated he probably would not still qualify as a voter and 
therefore could lose his office 
elected officials said they were stunned by the news of barrys 
arrest and many predicted he now will have a difficult time 
gaining support for a fourth term 
i just think this is going to be a terrible shock to the young 
people of our city said city councilman john ray one of those 
challenging barry for the democratic mayoral nomination 
others spoke of the irony of the citys top elected official 
facing drug charges as drugrelated murders continued to plague the 
city 
obviously anybody who has to depend on public support in a 
time where there is drug pushing and a lot of killing will be 
negatively affected politically said councilman frank smith 
this is a difficult thing to deal with 
but nearly all observers said the mayors arrest is the latest 
indignity for a city burdened over the past two years with an 
increasingly negative image around the country 
as a native washingtonian its embarrassing hobson said 
it is also a truly sad time for local washington

new yorks metropolitan museum of art 
will help one of europes leastknown art museums the romanian 
national restore a collection damaged by revolution and four 
decades of communist rule 
philippe de montebello director of the metropolitan museum of 
art met with senior cultural officials thursday to assess the 
damage and he said afterward he will try to raise corporate 
support to give the romanians basic materials and equipment 
one way to help may be to exhibit at the met six to eight of the 
best works from the romanian collection which features el grecos 
van eycks and french impressionists de montebello said 
the romanian collection and its museum were severely damaged in 
the revolution that toppled dictator nicolae ceausescu on dec 22 
it also had suffered for years beforehand from lack of funds and 
political manipulation the romanian and american museum officials 
say 
the problems are much greater than the damage caused by the 
revolution said everett fahy the mets chief curator who 
accompanied de montebello due to decades of neglect their 
heritage is disintegrating 
dorana cosoveanu an art critic who has spent 25 years at the 
romanian national gallery confirmed that as she guided a visitor 
around the burnedout bullet and mortarscarred galleries of what 
used to be an art museum 
in 1977 ceausescu appointed alexander cebuc a historian 
specializing in communist party lore to head the art gallery she 
said 
part of the ceausescu personality cult were the exhibits the 
dictator and his wife elena constantly imposed on the museum 
forcing it to turn over its ground floor galleries to giant 
paintings glorifying the ruling couple she said 
now as workers begin the enormous task of repairing the gallery 
and dozens of canvases ripped by bullets there is just one 
painting a torn portrait of the ceausescus left hanging 
part of a vast canvas showing the rulers surrounded by romanian 
children in folk costume it has been vandalized by the workers to 
depict ceausescu as a latterday adolf hitler complete with nazi 
swastika medal and ss on his lapels and shows his wife as a 
shedevil with giant red ears 
the gallerys real exhibits are in storage some of them 
bandaged as primitively as injured victims of the revolution in the 
museum workers attempts to carry out what cosoveanu termed first 
aid on the damaged paintings 
de montebello said the museum needs everything from rice paper 
and canvas to photocopying machines he also said its workers need 
to gain modern expertise by interning at the met 
what some of the museums employees lacked in that knowledge 
they made up in devotion as the gallery came under heavy fire in 
the battle against ceausescu 
the gallery was heavily attacked because it was housed in one 
wing of ceausescus official presidential palace the former palace 
of romanias kings in central bucharest 
an attic common to the presidential quarters and the gallery 
apparently enabled the terrorists as romanians call the 
ceausescu loyalists to sneak down a nowblackened staircase in 
the museum to battle the army outside 
not one museum window survived the onslaught of gunfire and 
mortars in the battle between soldiers loyal to the revolt and 
elite ceausescu guards opposing it 
cosoveanu first realized the museums collection could be in 
danger hours before the dictators overthrow when angry crowds 
swarmed into the palace square early on dec 22 
she feared they did not know that one wing of the palace was an 
art collection leaping from the ground floor window of a now 
burnedout office she ran to the crowds to urge them against 
attack assuring them this was a museum not a ceausescu haunt 
museum workers meanwhile scrambled to remove to storage the 
paintings and artifacts small enough for them to carry she said 
young people and even cebuc and other party officials helped 
as fierce fighting erupted toward evening trapping her and other 
loyal workers in the museum 
eventually soldiers arrived they were too late to save 16 
destroyed canvases or to prevent severe damage to at least 20 
others 
under the guidance of cosoveanu and other museum officials who 
braved heavy gunfire to return to the gallery however they moved 
a giant el greco adoration and several other valuable works to 
safety 
a tour of the museum made evident it will take years to repair 
the damage done to romanias finest art collection but the 
revolution has restored to the museum some hope it can once again 
become a national pride 
well have the whole building cosoveanu said when i was 
a student the museum was in all the palace so well go back to 
older times in this respect i hope

an army colonel three 
lieutenants and five enlisted men were charged with murder today in 
the november slayings of six jesuit priests their housekeeper and 
her teenage daughter 
judge ricardo zamora of the 4th penal court ordered the eight 
defendants in custody held for trial on charges of murder with 
premeditation and perfidy which carries a maximum sentence of 
30 years according to court secretary nicolas hernandez 
the ninth suspect deserted from the army in december and is a 
fugitive 
zamora issued his ruling at the end of a 72hour deadline that 
began tuesday when the prisoners who have been under arrest since 
early january were put at the disposition of the court 
the ruling means there is enough evidence to make a case against 
the defendants the ruling begins a 120day period during which the 
case is prepared for trial but this investigation phase can be 
delayed by motions 
col guillermo benavides director of the military college is 
the highest ranking armed forces officer to be accused of a crime 
involving a human rights abuse in the 10yearold civil war against 
leftist guerrillas 
the slain jesuits were educators at the jose simeon canas 
central american university one of the regions top colleges 
the killings shocked el salvador and the world and prompted 
calls in the congress for reappraisal of the 15 million daily 
that washington supplies in us economic and military aid to this 
small central american nation 
no military officer has been convicted before of a crime linked 
to human rights abuses even though rightist death squads sponsored 
or tolerated by the armed forces killed thousands of suspected 
leftists in the early 1980s 
the jesuits and the two women were slain in their campus home 
nov 16 five days after the farabundo marti national liberation 
front guerrillas launched their biggest offensive of the war 
the far right had long accused the jesuits of being subversive 
ideologues because of they publicly argued that the civil war was 
the result of gross social injustice rather than a communist

a federal appeals court conceded that 
the confederate battle flag that flies atop the alabama capitol is 
offensive to many people but declined to get involved in the 
dispute 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals in a ruling made public 
thursday said the flying of the rebel banner on public buildings 
does not violate the constitution as alleged by the naacp and 14 
black state lawmakers 
the atlantabased appeals court upheld a district court decision 
in favor of the state rejecting claims that the flag display 
violates the first 13th and 14th amendments 
the national association for the advancement of colored people 
along with the 14 legislators sued the state to remove the 
confederate flag which flies on top of the capitol dome with the 
american and state flags 
one of the legislators rep alvin holmes said no decision had 
been made on an appeal but he hopes the case is taken to the us 
supreme court 
the issue of the confederate flag is not going to go away we 
are going to continue our efforts to remove it because it 
represents slavery and oppression toward black people its hurting 
the image of the state and hurting industry coming into the 
state holmes said 
the appeals court suggested that those who oppose the display go 
through the legislature to get it taken down 
it is unfortunate that the state of alabama chooses to utilize 
its property in a manner that offends a large portion of its 
population but that is a political matter the court said 
the naacp said the flying of the flag amounted to use of state 
property for racially discriminatory purposes violatated the 13th 
amendment ban on slavery as it was viewed by many blacks as a 
symbol of slavery and violated free speech because salutation of 
the american flag was inhibited by those who oppose the confederate 
flag 
the 11th circuit rejected all three arguments 
the 30 decision came from a panel composed of us circuit 
judges frank johnson jr and larry edmondson and robert f 
peckham a senior us district judge from california johnson

emperor akihito will be formally enthroned in 
november in two ceremonies costing 556 million a government 
committee decided friday 
the decision was made official during a cabinet meeting after 
the committee chaired by prime minister toshiki kaifu discussed 
and approved the ceremony dates an official at the prime 
ministers office said 
the coronation will be held as a state affair at the imperial 
palace in tokyo on nov 12 while the daijosai or great food 
offering ritual will be conducted according to customs of the 
shinto religion on the evening of nov 22 and will last into the 
following day 
akihito 56 assumed the chrysanthemum throne when his father 
hirohito died of cancer at age 87 on jan 7 1989 but he and 
other imperial family members avoided holding important ceremonies 
and observed a yearlong mourning period thus delaying the 
coronation 
the government has earmarked 556 million as expenses for the 
two ceremonies in next fiscal years budget which starts april 1 
in the coronation akihito will announce his accession to about 
2500 invited dignitaries at the palace 
akihito and empress michiko will then lead a parade through 
tokyo to announce the coronation and receive blessings from the 
people four days of banquets are to be held from that evening 
with a total guest list of 3400 
in the controversial daijosai the new emperor offers freshly 
harvested rice to the gods of shinto then joins the gods in a 
communion and sleeps with the spirit of the sun goddess according 
to the shinto religion shinto is an indigenous faith based on 
nature worship shamanism and elaborate rites 
the cabinet has said the daijosai is a public ceremony in 
nature but that it will not conduct the rite as a state affair 
because that might violate the constitutional separation of state

the army ambulances screaming through london 
traffic look like a throwback to world war ii but they symbolize a 
modernday battle between prime minister margaret thatcher and the 
nations ambulance drivers 
army and police ambulances have been thrown into the fray while 
the government and the drivers vie for public opinion in a pay 
dispute that is nearly 5 months old and ranks among the classic 
confrontations with organized labor that have marked mrs 
thatchers decade in power 
routine services have ceased almost throughout the country 
forcing state health authorities to hire taxis and relatives to use 
their own cars to bring nonemergency cases to hospitals 
emergency calls are diverted to the police army or red cross 
meanwhile some crews suspended for joining the dispute are 
operating an unofficial service they accept emergency calls direct 
from hospitals or members of the public but not from the ambulance 
control rooms which are their management 
each side accuses the other of being callous and risking lives 
in the increasingly bizarre and acrimonious dispute there are no 
official figures on strikerelated deaths but doctors in 
birmingham central england say they know of three patients who 
died because help arrived too late 
the protests began sept 7 when britains 22500 ambulance 
drivers started refusing to work overtime 
in october emergency crews stopped using their radios or in 
many cases answering calls routed through control rooms 
their employer the statefunded national health service 
responded by suspending the drivers without pay 
with the crisis deepening the conservative party government 
ordered in police and army ambulances on nov 8 it was the first 
time they had been used for civilian ambulance work since 197879 
when public service strikes hit a labor party government 
as frustration mounts crews at half a dozen stations in london 
and south england recently defied union orders and voted to strike 
union leaders fear this will alienate the public 
the public which in the past has backed mrs thatcher against 
the oncepowerful unions has so far supported the ambulance crews 
they have become national heroes during an 18month string of 
national disasters including the bombing of pan am flight 103 
the latest gallup opinion poll says they are backed by 85 
percent of britons 
four million people signed a petition of support and 30000 
turned out to cheer the crews as they marched through central 
london 
health secretary kenneth clarke the governments frontline 
fighter in the dispute rejects the crews claim to be treated like 
police and firefighters arguing that only 10 percent of ambulance 
work involves real emergencies 
but he has blundered in his choice of words saying most 
ambulance crews run a taxi service for old ladies and that 
they are little more than professional drivers a worthwhile job 
but not an exceptional one 
such imagery goes down poorly with a public that is used to 
seeing ambulance crews cutting survivors out of train wrecks or 
wading into burning subway stations 
we are sick to death of this government attending every 
disaster that occurs saying how wonderful the emergency services 
are and then refusing to pay them a decent wage says labor 
lawmaker dawn primarolo 
ambulance crews who earn 16630 a year want 114 percent 
more plus the automatic inflationlinked raises given to 
firefighters and policemen 
the government has offered 65 percent and bonuses for staff 
who have paramedical skills the drivers reject that as elitist 
and divisive 
the confrontation encapsulates the problems mrs thatcher faces 
amid signs that britain is slipping back into old habits of pricing 
itself out of the market with inflationfueling wage hikes 
latest figures show production costs in britain rising three 
times faster than in the united states and more than six times 
faster than in japan 
the ambulance crews demands could be met for a paltry 16 
million but inflation is near 8 percent and the government fears 
a surrender would encourage demands for doubledigit raises by the 
rest of the one million staff in the health service europes 
biggest employer 
to the government it doesnt matter who dies they are just 
hellbent on defeating us said chris cosham a 28yearold 
suspended ambulanceman it looks very desperate for us now but 
well give them a bloody fight

a droughtrelief program for farmers in 
1988 and 1989 suffered from poor financial controls that resulted 
in large uncollectable debts and sometimes involved poorquality 
hay according to an audit 
because controls over the program were weak the minnesota 
agriculture department and the state have lost money on the 
program according to a legislative auditors report released 
thursday 
the haylifts were implemented in an effort to get lowcost hay 
to droughtstricken farmers the state bought the hay at 
belowmarket prices and sold it to farmers for the same price 
the state bought 258000 worth of droughtrelief hay in 1988 
and by late last year had collected only 129325 from farmers the 
audit says the agriculture department said the 1988 haylift 
delivered hay to 432 farmers 407 of whom paid for it in the 1989 
haylift the state bought 176000 worth of hay delivered to 114 
farmers and had collected 81600 from only 78 farmers by late 
last year 
the auditor reported that some of the hay was so waterlogged or 
spoiled that it had to be buried in addition the audit said the 
state hadnt tried to collect on about 30000 worth of spoiled hay 
from the 1988 haylift 
on one occasion the audit reported the state paid people who 
had volunteered to work on the haylift program for nothing

a state appellate court today overturned the 
murder convictions of three former executives in the workrelated 
death of an employee exposed to cyanide on the job 
the 1985 cook county circuit court verdict against executives of 
elk grove villagebased film recovery systems inc was believed to 
be the first in which corporate officials were convicted of murder 
charges in a jobrelated death 
the appellate court ruled the convictions on charges of murder 
and on charges of involuntary manslaughter and reckless conduct 
were irreconcileable because of the different mental states 
required for such findings said defense attorney elliot samuels 
the court has opened the door for a new prosecution samuels 
said 
stefan golab 61 a polish immigrant who worked at the plant 
where cyanide was used to recover silver from used xray film 
collapsed at work after complaining of dizziness and nausea in 
1983 his death was attributed to cyanide poisoning from inhaling 
fumes on the job 
the appellate court sent the case back to the lower court where 
cook county states attorney cecil partee may pursue it if he 
decides to said spokesman ed mcmanus partee was out of the office 
and not immediately available for comment mcmanus said 
the states attorneys office under the direction of richard m 
daley now mayor of chicago successfully prosecuted the case in 
1985 
the appeals court overturned convictions on charges of murder 
reckless conduct and involuntary manlaughter against the defunct 
companys former president steven j oneil plant manager charles 
kirschbaum and foreman daniel rodriquez 
the men were found guilty at a bench trial before circuit judge 
ronald jp banks 
elliot who represent kirschbaum and rodriquez in the appeal 
said that a murder conviction required a determination of a 
deliberate state of mind while a finding of reckless conduct 
required a finding somewhere between negligence and indifference 
conscious disregard of serious risk 
we argued that contradiction at the trial level and at the 
appeal he said 
five people originally were charged gerald pett a vice 
president and manager was acquitted 
a fifth defendant utah businessman and former film recovery 
vice president michael mckay has been the subject of three 
unsuccessful extradition requests by illinois gov james r 
thompson utah officials said they questioned whether he could

texas gubernatorial candidate clayton 
williams is defending two fist fights during his adult life 
asking do you want a patsy for governor or somebody wholl fight 
for the things texas needs 
some of his election opponents have criticized the fights but 
the oilman rancher and republican frontrunner says in each case 
it was the proper thing to do 
i have had two fights in 33 years williams 58 said 
thursday thats not too bad i will defend myself 
the fights occurred in williams hometown of midland texas 
about five years ago 
williams shown leading the sevencandidate republican primary 
field in recent opinion polls was criticized this week by 
opponents kent hance and tom luce 
this is not like the old days in texas where you take the law 
into your own hands said luces campaign manager jim oberwetter 
its going to be up to the voters to decide if clayton 
williams propensity for fighting is going to be an issue said 
hance press secretary mark sanders 
but williams and his staff defended both encounters 
bill kenyon the candidates press secretary said the fights 
involved people who once were friends of williams one who had 
severely betrayed his trust and the other who was just an outright 
bully a physical bully to claytons employees he said 
williams said he had no regrets 
the one fight in question a guy became an alcholic he was a 
close friend of mine and i was not dealing with him but with the 
disease of alcoholism williams said he said the man had 
harassed all my little people for several years after williams 
fired him in 1978 
he came in the building one day raising cain it was my idea 
that this was mantoman it wasnt time to call a policeman or a 
lawyer it was he and i and i decked him and id do it again 
williams also defended the outcome 
are we interested in results the man never ever bothered any 
of my people again 
as the issue has gained publicity around the state williams and 
his staff appear to be enjoying the attention 
i dont now how tom luce would handle a bully but i think 
most texans would appreciate a man who would stand up to a bully 
whats he going to do call a lawyer responded kenyon when 
told of luces criticism

roughly half of the 35 million lowincome 
older americans covered by medicaid needlessly spend hundreds of 
dollars for private medical insurance according to a private study 
released friday 
between 15 million and 2 million people 65 and older are 
projected to have private insurance such as medigap policies 
even though medicaid covers their medical expenses the report said 
the study was commissioned and released by the american 
association of retired persons and prepared by market facts inc 
based on interviews with a random sample of 1500 older people 
contacted by telephone in january and february 1989 
these findings clearly demonstrate that much more needs to be 
done to prevent the sale of medigap policies to the 
medicaideligible population said aar executive director horace 
deets 
medigap policies are designed to cover certain hospital and 
other medical costs not covered by medicare other health insurance 
policies bought by older americans include hospital indemnity plans 
and policies covering specific diseases 
the survey found more than 3 million older americans who do not 
qualify for medicaid say they cannot afford to supplement their 
medicare coverage by buying medigap or other private health 
policies 
that number is expected to grow as medigap premiums rise pushed 
up in part by the repeal of medicares coverage of catastrophic 
health care expenses aarp said 
the governments general accounting office surveyed 20 major 
medigap insurers late last year and found that 1990 premiums were 
expected to rise by an average of 195 percent over 1989 levels 
with increases ranging from 5 percent to 52 percent the companies 
attributed more than half of the price rise to increased benefits 
and administrative costs created by the repeal of the catastrophic 
package 
the aarp study found that people paid an average of 705 a year 
in premiums for their medigap policies 
now that many benefits provided under the catastrophic act 
have been removed medigap insurance is all the more necessary 
deets said the real tragedy is that due to its increasing costs 
this coverage may be out of reach for more older persons

japanese expressed outrage friday over 
the attempted assassination of nagasakis mayor by an 
ultranationalist who said he couldnt condone the mayors 
comments about the late emperor hirohito 
about 300 city employees rallied outside city hall one day 
after hitoshi motoshima was shot there by a rightwing extremist 
motoshima had received death threats since he said in december 
1988 that he felt hirohito at the time dying of cancer bore some 
responsibility for world war ii 
the mayor was shot but he was not the only target democracy 
is being threatened said yukiyoshi sato secretarygeneral of 
the nagasaki city hall workers union 
theyve caught the assailant but thats just the tip of the 
rightists theyll just keep coming back sato said as he sat at 
the wheel of a van carrying a large banner reading bullets 
cannot kill democracy 
police arrested kazumi tajiri an avoved rightwing terrorist 
from tokyo and searched offices of the sane thinkers school the 
rightist group to which he belonged a police official said on 
condition of anonymity 
tajiri 40 admitted shooting motoshima and said he couldnt 
condone motoshimas remarks police told reporters the 
67yearold mayor also said at the time that hirohito could have 
prevented the atomic bombing of nagasaki on aug 9 1945 and of 
hiroshima three days earlier the nuclear attack on nagasaki left 
at least 70000 people dead 
the comments infuriated japans small but radical rightwing 
fringe who revere the imperial family and descended on city hall 
in sound trucks demanding death to motoshima police protection 
was provided until motoshima asked that it be discontinued last 
month 
following the shooting the national police agency urged local 
authorities to increase their vigilance over the nations 820 
rightwing groups and recommended tighter security for public 
figures 
at the city hall rally sato said the mayor risked his own 
life in fighting to protect freedom of speech and democracy we 
declare our resolve to resolutely uphold these principles in the 
wake of this attempt to suppress them with a pistol 
motoshima was shot once in the back with the bullet slightly 
damaging his left lung doctors said he would recover and could 
leave the hospital in a month 
government officials were quick to condemn the attack 
it cannot be tolerated in the context of freedom and 
democracy said chief cabinet secretary mayumi moriyama the top 
government spokeswoman 
in an editorial the daily asahi shimbun said such violence 
will lead to fascism 
its a real shock in japan its so rare for anyone to have a 
gun just police and gangsters said mikako umehara a city hall 
employee for this to happen right in front of our eyes is i 
think a much bigger shock than for americans or europeans 
possession of handguns is illegal in japan and only police the 
military and strictly licensed hunters are allowed firearms 
the nagasaki city council on friday condemned the attack which 
it called not only a challenge to freedom of speech but a threat 
to the very existence of a democratic society 
hirohito died jan 7 1988 at the age of 87 and formal 
enthronement ceremonies will take place nov 12 for emperor 
akihito his son 
hirohito renounced his divinity after the war many historians 
agree he was a figurehead wartime leader but some critics say he 
played a more active role 
motoshima received several visitors friday said city spokesman 
masayuki chita several police guarded the hospital 
chita said getwell wishes came from more than 500 people 
including some in nagasakis sister cities st paul minn and 
fuzhou china

nearly all major figures in nicolae 
ceausescus government including all but one of the 19 surviving 
members of his politburo are in custody and will face trial the 
prosecutorgeneral said friday 
also on friday state media reported that the leader of the 
romanian orthodox church stepped down after criticism that he was 
an apologist for the ousted communist dictator 
about 200 students walked out of classes at bucharest 
universitys college of architecture demanding that 26 of the 
schools 82 professors be fired as incompetents who gained their 
positions though political connections during ceausescus brutal 
24year rule 
prosecuting ceausescu loyalists is a key test of the national 
salvation front the provisional government that is struggling to 
gain the support of the people and lead the country to free 
elections later this year 
prosecutorgeneral gheorghe robu said in an interview in the 
newspaper adevarul that 18 members of the former 21member 
politburo were in custody two others ceausescu and his wife 
elena were convicted of grave crimes and executed dec 25 
three days after they were ousted in a popular uprising 
the only politburo member not under arrest was paul niculescu a 
more liberal official who is said to have offered his services to 
the new government 
robu said that 31 former highranking officials have been 
arrested in all including one of ceausescus sons nicu the 
former party chief in the western city of sibiu robu said most of 
the jailed ceausescu figures were cooperating with investigators 
those expected to be tried first are former communist party 
secretary emil bobu no 3 in the government behind the ceausescus 
and former interior minister tudor postelnicu who headed the 
despised securitate secret police also among those to be tried are 
politburo members manea manescu and ion dinca 
their trials were expected to begin next week before a military 
tribunal 
robu said one of ceausescus daughters zoiaelena and another 
son valentin were in jail but were not leading figures in the 
ousted regime 
the prosecutor said zoiaelena had gone on a brief hunger strike 
in her first days in jail refusing anything but coffee and smoking 
her own supply of american cigarettes 
we told to her that shes living in exactly the same 
conditions that the romanian people were subjected to and shes 
adopted reasonable behavior the newspaper quoted robu as saying 
defense minister nicolae militaru wrote in the newspaper that 
the flow of electricity might be cut to some large industries 
saying the countrys energy supply was endangered by factories 
routinely using more than their allotted share 
enterprises that draw too much power and do not obey the 
regulations will have their electricity shut down he said 
on tuesday romanias generating plants had to produce 300 extra 
megawatts of power to meet demand he said 
under ceausescus rule heating and electricity were strictly 
limited in public buildings and hundreds of thousands of 
stateowned apartments to conserve energy so that romania could 
export oil 
one of the first steps taken by new government was to increase 
heating and release to the public food in state warehouses 
since then emergency supplies of both food and fuel have had to 
be imported 
romanian media said the patriarch of the orthodox church 
teoctist arapasu officially resigned thursday for reasons of age 
and health his age was not given 
there had been a clamor for his dismissal since the revolution 
under ceausescu the church advised its flock to be loyal to the 
regime despite repeated government interference in church matters 
such as the the jailing of priests that displeased the regime and 
banning of some services 
the denomination is the nations larges claiming a membership 
of 16 million out of romanias population of 23 million 
about 200 of the 500 students in bucharests architecture school 
went on strike friday many pinning small triangular signs on their 
shirts that said simply greva or strike 
student dumitru iulian 21 said he and his colleagues said 
students would refuse to attend classes until 26 incompetent 
professors were removed 
this is the way the regime worked these professors scaled the 
professional ladder through their politics iulian said

a young doctor suing the hospital where she says 
she contracted aids was dimissed from the witness stand today 
because she was still devastated by her physicians testimony that 
she might die within a year 
im having trouble talking i dont think i can go on today i 
apologize dr veronica prego told the trial judge justice 
aaron d bernstein after five minutes of testimony 
thats ok dont apologize said bernstein who postponed 
the proceedings until monday 
one of pregos lawyers susan m karten said her client had 
complained of a headache and did not sleep thursday night 
hearing that shes going to die within a year had caused 
pregos restlessness karten said she didnt know that shes 
just terribly devastated 
prego who was among the first health professionals to contract 
aids at the workplace through a needle stick cried thursday when 
she first heard her physician estimate how long she could live 
the blunt assessment came in response to a lawyers question 
before asking it stanley d friedman the lawyer for the city 
health and hospitals corp offered to allow prego 32 to leave 
the courtroom she declined 
its impossible to predict but its possible her life 
expectancy will be a year or perhaps shorter dr gerald h 
friedland said when friedman asked how long prego would live 
friedland pregos physican for more than three years said he 
had never specifically discussed with prego how long he believed 
she had to live 
friedman said the answer was something the jury had to know if 
it ruled for prego and awarded damages for future suffering and 
lost earnings 
pregos 67yearold mother who testified early in the trial and 
has sat in the front row of the spectators section daily looked 
on but did not understand the prognosis because she speaks only 
spanish 
prego moved to the united states in 1982 from argentina where 
her family still lives 
she maintains she contracted aids on jan 12 1983 while 
working at kings county hospital when she accidentally pricked her 
finger on a contaminated needle carelessly left amid a pile of 
soiled gauze and bed linen by another physician dr joyce fogel 
she is suing the hospital its parent agency the health and 
hospitals corp fogel and another physican sheldon landesman for 
175 million charging negligence 
the defendants say prego who was an unpaid medicalschool 
graduate in training at the time was injured through her own 
carelessness 
landesman a researcher with the state university of new york 
and a physician at kings county hospital conducted a 1984 study 
that revealed prego to be what is believed the first healthcare 
worker in the country to get aids through a needle stick 
prego charges landesman with breaching a pledge of 
confidentiality and revealing to other doctors that prego had been 
infected with the fatal diseaselandesman has denied the claim 
prego conceded under questioning thursday that the information 
she received from landesmans study may have helped save her life 
in november 1987 when she developed acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome and nearly died of pneumonia 
the centers for disease control has 19 confirmed cases of us 
health workers contracting aids in the workplace but officials say 
the real figure probably is much higher

mayor marion barry appeared before a federal 
magistrate today on a misdemeanor narcotics charge stemming from a 
federal sting operation that law enforcement officials said caught 
him on videotape buying and smoking crack cocaine 
a federal magistrate ordered barry to appear for a status 
hearing feb 5 and required him to submit to drug testing every 
monday 
court papers filed by federal prosecutors said tests conducted 
on blood and urine samples taken from the mayor following his 
arrest thursday night showed evidence of cocaine ingestion 
barry who has repeatedly denied drug use was in court for 10 
minutes and spoke only his name and swore to appear at the hearing 
he was not asked to enter a plea to the charge of possessing a 
controlled substance crack cocaine in this case the charge 
carries a maximum penalty of one year in jail and a fine of 5000 
his attorney r kenneth mundy told the magistrate that barry 
wanted a jury trial and waived his right to a preliminary hearing 
he said the mayor would plead innocent 
i am going to leave here and go about the business of 
government barry told reporters outside the courthouse after the 
hearing he declined to discuss his legal or political future 
top city officials said barrys plans to launch his campaign for 
a fourth term on sunday were being postponed indefinitely four 
current or former city officials already were lined up to run 
against the embattled mayor and jesse jackson also was understood 
to be considering entering the race 
magistrate deborah robinson said barry would remain free until 
the hearing but she ordered him to telephone court pretrial 
services once a week 
after the hearing barry was taken to a cellblock in the federal 
courthouse to be booked 
barry seemed at ease and smiled before and after the hearing and 
greeted wellwishers in the courtroom while he waited for the 
magistrate to appear he sat with his wife effie and talked with 
her and his press secretary 
the purpose of this hearing is to advise you of the charge 
the magistrate told barry she then read the charge and told barry 
you are not required to make any statement 
barry swore to tell the truth and stated his name 
judith retchin an assistant us attorney said the government 
did not oppose barrys release on a personal bond and asked only 
standard conditions for his release 
us attorney jay stephens said after the hearing that the 
undercover operation which focused on allegations involving barry 
was scrupulously fair and that the mayor was not entrapped 
where there is predisposition there is not entrapment he said 
according to court papers filed by federal prosecutors the 
mayor was observed by an fbi agent through a surveillance camera 
giving a quantity of currency to a cooperating witness in 
return for a quantity of the illegal drug 
mr barry put some of the crack cocaine in a smoking 
apparatus lit the crack cocaine and smoked it fbi agent ronald 
d stern said in an affidavit 
the hotel room where barry was arrested was rented for the 
occasion by the fbi according to the affidavit filed in us 
district court 
the affidavit filed in court said tests conducted on blood and 
urine samples taken from the mayor following his arrest showed 
evidence of cocaine ingestion 
the cocaine base was obtained from the drug enforcement 
administration in anticipation of an undercover operation the 
fbi affidavit stated 
after his arrest at the hotel barry was released on his own 
recognizance and spent the night at his home where he conferred 
with city officials and lawyers 
the fbi used a woman to get barry to the hotel room but would 
provide no further details said a law enforcment source who spoke 
on condition of anonymity the woman was described by another 
source familiar with the case as a lowlevel employee of the 
district of columbia government 
asked early today about the amount of drugs involved mundy 
pinched his forefinger and thumb closely together and grinned 
at the justice department chief spokesman david runkel said 
attorney general dick thornburgh had been told in advance of the 
undercover operation 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said justice department 
officials notified bush of barrys arrest bush said he had no 
comment about the incident 
barrys arrest resulted from a joint undercover public 
corruption probe by the fbi and the internal affairs division of 
the washington metropolitan police department us attorney jay 
stephens said in a statement 
the arrest occurred a day before todays scheduled sentencing of 
charles lewis a former friend of the mayor and now a government 
informant for conspiracy to distribute cocaine when lewis pleaded 
guilty to the charge last year he told the judge he had given 
cocaine to the mayor 
barrys troubles coupled with the citys soaring homicide rate 
that police attribute to drugtrafficking have attracted 
nationwide attention 
jackson a twotime presidential candidate who has campaigned 
against drugs across the country fueled speculation he would run 
for mayor when he moved to washington last year but jackson said 
he would not challenge barry he said today that he was stunned 
by the arrrest 
councilwoman charlene drew jarvis who has announced her 
candidacy for mayor said barrys arrest changes the political 
landscape of the city 
david clarke city council chairman and a mayoral candidate 
called the arrest a tragic moment in our citys history 
top city officials met into the early hours today to assess the 
impact of the mayors arrest on the operation of the district of 
columbias government 
wusatv reported that barry was lured to the hotel to visit a 
longtime woman friend from california 
the station said the fbi asked the woman to come to washington a 
week ago to set up a meeting with barry barry made several 
previous trips to see her during her stay the station said fbi 
agents babysat the womans children during her visit according to 
the report 
an earlier federal investigation into allegations of cocaine use 
by barry was thwarted by the refusal of a woman with whom the 
mayor admitted having a personal relationship to testify 
before a grand jury 
karen johnson a former city worker who was convicted of drug 
charges in 1984 was imprisoned for several months following her 
refusal to testify about selling cocaine to barry

an attorney for an imprisoned irish republican 
army member argued friday that the justice department overstepped 
the law in its efforts to deport the man to northern ireland 
the hearing before the 2nd us circuit court of appeals was the 
latest proceeding in joe dohertys highly publicized 6year legal 
battle to fight extradition and deportation 
if he loses doherty could be returned to face life in prison 
for the 1980 killing of a british army captain and a later prison 
escape doherty 34 has been imprisoned since his arrest at a 
manhattan bar in june 1983 
the british government maintains doherty is a common criminal 
who should be extradited to face trial he and his supporters 
maintain he committed a political act not subject to extradition 
and that he deserves political asylum the ira says it is fighting 
to oust the british from northern ireland 
doherty has won decisions before two federal judges a federal 
appeals court an immigration judge and three immigration appeals 
boards 
but in june 1988 attorney general edwin meese iii intervened 
and ordered his deportation later attorney general richard 
thornburgh overturned an immigration appeals board decision to 
reopen dohertys deportation case 
the hearing thursday stemmed from dohertys appeal of the 
rulings by meese and thornburgh if his appeal is successful 
doherty will be granted another round in immigration courts this 
time to apply for political asylum 
as throughout his legal battle emotions ran high at the 
hearing doherty was not present but the courtroom was filled with 
his supporters 
his attorney mary pike asserted that the attorneys general 
improperly intervened in dohertys case 
what we see in this case is the naked manipulation of an 
administrative proceeding pike told the three judges hearing the 
appeal 
she said the central issue was that the attorney general is 
not above the law and that no individual including my client is 
outside the law 
pike also noted that 46 members of congress had signed a brief 
supporting dohertys position 
special assistant us attorney noel anne ferris argued that the 
appeal should be denied because doherty had earlier conceded that 
he is deportable and had waived his right to apply for political 
asylum 
ferris also said meese was correct in ruling that it was in the 
interest of the us government to deport doherty it was in our 
interest as a country fighting terrorism to return doherty she 
said 
the three judges wilfred feinberg george pratt and edward 
lumbard reserved decision and will issue a written opinion at a 
later date

soviet miners visiting the united states 
said friday they didnt believe last years coal strikes in their 
homeland were very successful 
nine miners who belong to a new soviet coal miners union are 
touring appalachian coal fields this month comparing techniques 
and labor organizations and said their own battle had a long way 
to go 
it turns out were not fighting against an owner but a 
government system miner gennady sharov said during a stop in 
southern west virginia to win we have to change laws as it 
turns out it isnt just a strike for coal miners but for the 
nation 
the group of russian ukranian and kazakh miners all were 
prominent players in last summers coal strike which ended after 
soviet leaders agreed to recognize their union and negotiate better 
salaries and work and safety rules 
miner oleg kul said the coal strike was the first critical move 
by soviet workers in 70 years 
its an important step to solidify perestroika and 
democratization that has been going on for five years kul said 
perestroika is the soviet governments relaxation of hardline 
restrictions 
kul and sharov each believe miners have the backing of the 
soviet politburo but that they are fighting a middlelevel of 
soviet administration 
they worry about what will happen if our demands are met they 
dont want to make changes theyre passive about it kul said 
they say what can i do i have no rights just as you dont 
kul said soviet president mikhail gorbachev seems ready to 
declare war on the middle administration to ensure changes filter 
down to the working class as far as the strike and negotiations 
went the government supported the right of the miners to go on 
strike he said 
the group arrived in the united states two weeks ago and visited 
leaders of united mine workers of america and the aflcio in new 
york and washington dc before traveling to west virginia

violins and a sword reportedly used by civil war general william t 
sherman 
the merchandise which also included books coin collections 
toy cars and guns was found thursday in a storage locker 
were saying halfamillion dollars right now but thats 
probably a very conservative estimate said dennis palmentera an 
investigator with the ohio organized crime investigation commission 
police have arrested 29 people since a grand jury in columbus 
ohio returned secret indictments jan 2 in connection with an 
ohiobased burglary ring but no arrests have been made involving 
the savannah cache 
investigators say the ring has operated for 20 years and is 
blamed for more than 18 million in thefts over five years 
the ring had fingered out from ohio said harold crabtree 
also an investigator with the ohio task force it spread from 
ohio to florida and was in every state in between 
the shermanrelated items which included a portrait of the 
union general were stolen from shermans birthplace museum in 
lancaster ohio investigators said 
the violins were believed made by antonio stradivari the famous 
italian craftsman 
palmentera said investigators believe the antiques stashed in 
savannah were destined for a major antiques show in norcross 
they store it for six months or a year until it cools off 
then theyd sell it palmentera said they sell it in the major 
shows because this stuff is hard to track

peggy mcmartin buckey acquitted in the 
mcmartin preschool molestation case said today she would pursue a 
federal civil lawsuit alleging malicious prosecution despite death 
threats to her family 
mrs buckey addressing a packed news conference said she at 
first hesitated to become involved in further litigation 
i said to my lawyer is it worth going to court about im 
tired of going to court im tired of enduring what ive had to 
endure 
but she said she felt those responsible for ruining her life 
should have to account for it 
mrs buckey and her son raymond won acquittal of 52 felony child 
molestation charges jurors in the nations longest and costliest 
criminal trial thursday deadlocked on 12 other sex abuse counts 
against buckey and a single conspiracy count against him and his 
63yearold mother 
superior court judge william pounders declared a mistrial on the 
12 counts and dismissed the deadlocked conspiracy charge against 
mrs buckey he set a jan 31 hearing to determine whether the 13 
unresolved counts will be dismissed against buckey 
buckey 31 who spent nearly five years in jail before making 
bail and his mother who was jailed for almost two years cried as 
they heard the verdicts 
if it can happen to seven innocent people it can happen to 
you too if it had not been in my faith in god i wouldnt be here 
today mrs buckey said 
buckey avoided reporters after the verdict 
initially five other teachers including mrs buckeys mother 
and daughter were charged 
the trial cost about 15 million and lasted nearly three years 
the lawsuit filed today names as defendants los angeles county 
the city of manhattan beach former district attorney robert 
philibosian childrens institute international and therapist kee 
mcfarlane as well as capital citiesabc inc and its former 
reporter wayne satz 
it contended that all defendants joined in a conspiracy to have 
the mcmartin defendants indicted the lawsuit sought general 
damages of 1 million and unspecified special damages 
mrs buckey said that after verdicts were announced thursday a 
parent of a mcmartin school child approached mrs buckeys husband 
charles and threatened to kill him she did not elaborate 
she also said that children who attended the once prestigious 
but now defunct school trailed her to her car and screamed 
epithets at her 
some of the childrens parents gasped when the verdicts were 
announced 
the anger is beginning to rise said mary mae cioffi we 
have programs all over the country that tell children to run and 
tell when somebody hurts them and our children told some of them 
spent 35 days on the stand and they get a not guilty it shows 
that our justice system needs a revamp for kids 
although they did not testify she added i know my children 
were molested i had my daughter sleep between my husband and i for 
a whole year because she was so afraid somebody would come and get 
her that they would kill her because she told 
the investigation of alleged mass molestation at the familyrun 
school in suburban manhattan beach ignited a nationwide wave of 
worry about child abuse when it came to light in 1983 it produced 
widespread fear among working parents that their children might be 
at risk at school 
jurors who cleared the pair thursday said children may have been 
molested but they said prosecutors in the trial failed to link 
sexual abuse to the defendants 
i tried to believe the children said juror daryl hutchins 
but he said the youngsters had been so contaminated by 
parents suggestions and therapists who interviewed them that he 
could not accept their testimony 
the most important evidence jurors said were videotapes of 
interviews conducted with alleged victims at childrens institute 
international a private child abuse center the jurors said 
interviewers used leading questions and coached the children on how 
they should answer 
i believe that the children believed what they were saying was 
true in the courtroom said juror brenda williams i could not 
tell from watching the tape that the children were telling what 
actually happened to them or if they were repeating what their 
parents told them 
some parents said the judicial system failed 
i fear that because of this verdict no child will be seen as 
a credible witness from now on said alan lagunoff his son now 
10 attended the school for 1 years but wasnt a witness at the 
trial 
prosecutor lael rubin who devoted six years to the case said 
we ultimately must respect the jurys decision even though i 
personally disagree with it 
the case began in august 1983 with a complaint from judy 
johnson a mother who reported her 2yearold child had been 
molested at the suburban school by a man called ray 
police sent letters to mcmartin parents warning of possible 
molestation soon dozens of parents reported their children had 
been victimized 
mrs johnson suffering from alcohol and mental problems died 
at age 44 a few months before the trial began in april 1987 
defense attorneys contended the case was largely the result of her 
increasingly bizarre allegations 
children gave accounts of satanic rites and animals tortured to 
frighten youngsters into silence testimony at an 18month 
preliminary hearing featured tales of molestations at a church a 
car wash and a market as well as naked games at the school 
juror julie peters said she felt the case had destroyed many 
lives 
i think everybody was a victim she said i dont think 
anybody came out of this case a winner

a federal judge today refused to order government 
investigators to stay away from defense witnesses in the case of a 
codefendant of manuel noriega 
but us district judge william hoeveler urged both sides to 
avoid intimidation 
an attorney for luis del cid alleged to be a top aide to 
noriega complained to the court that investigators from the 
immigration and naturalization service visited the defendantss 
wife and two friends soon after the three testified at a bond 
hearing this week 
these witnesses declined to go back to court today they are 
terrified said attorney samuel burstyn 
they are worried about their immigration status 
del cids wife is panamanian and the other two women are 
nicaraguan refugees 
but hoeveler noted the women tilsa del cid and norma and 
eglantina alvarez had offered to take custody of del cid if he is 
freed on bond 
it is important for me to get the full picture of what their 
status is hoeveler said 
ins agents had demanded that three women who testified for del 
cid on tuesday turn over all their immigration papers and give 
information about how they gained entry into the united states 
burstyn wrote in a request for the emergency hearing 
the timing reflects vividly that this is a retaliatory measure 
aimed at intimidating these and other defense witnesses said 
burstyn 
on tuesday the alvarez sisters testified that del cid helped 
them flee into panama to avoid persecution by the sandinistas 
in his motion thursday burstyn said that immigration agents had 
asked the sisters whether they once worked for nicaraguas 
sandinista government and implied that there was something 
improper about their escape into panama 
earlier thursday burstyn and other defense attorneys accused 
the government of balking at court orders to turn over both secret 
and nonsecret documents to aid the defense 
there is a desire to stonewall information to hermetically 
seal off the guts and gore of the early investigation said 
burstyn adding that he hoped the tentative march 5 trial date for 
noriega would force the government to stop dragging his feet 
prosecutors last week threatened to try michael okane lawyer 
for the accused drug pilot daniel miranda for mentioning the 
existence of a national security agency listening post in panama 
city despite the fact the office is shown on a map in the panama 
city telephone book 
also a lawyer for convicted drug kingpin carlos lehder rivas 
strongly denied his client will cooperate with prosecutors to 
convict the deposed panamanian leader despite a taped interview 
the imprisoned trafficker gave implicating noriega 
he will be no witness against noriega there is no deal 
lehders attorney jose quinon said thursday

anglican envoy terry waite begins his 
fourth year as a hostage of proiranian shiite moslem militants on 
saturday with his fate and those of other captives apparently 
hinging on a power struggle in tehran 
a reliable shiite source who is familiar with the thinking of 
the hostageholding factions said the issue of the 18 westerners 
missing in lebanon is on the back burner until irans political 
infighting is settled 
any settlement to the hostage issue must await the outcome of 
the power struggle in iran the source said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
waite 50 disappeared in moslem west beirut jan 20 1987 he 
was last seen leaving his seaside hotel to keep a rendezvous with 
kidnappers holding two americans journalist terry anderson and 
scottishborn educator thomas sutherland to negotiate their 
release 
no group has claimed it holds waite and there has been no word 
on his fate but western and lebanese intelligence officials are 
convinced he is held by islamic jihad or islamic holy war the 
group holding anderson and sutherland british intelligence sources 
said they believe he is still alive 
archbishop of canterbury robert runcie said he is confident his 
envoy will be released 
there are others who have been unheard of for longer and i 
remain optimistic that terry is there and that one day he will 
return to us the anglican leader said in an interview televised 
friday in london 
david waite said on the program he believed his brother was 
alive 
although there seems to be nothing visible happening im just 
very hopeful that some time and please let it be soon we will see 
this situation start to turn around logically its got to come to 
an end some time he said 
waite is one of 18 westerners including eight americans 
missing in lebanon 
most are believed held by factions of the iranianbacked shiite 
fundamentalist hezbollah or party of god the longest held is 
anderson chief middle east correspondent of the associated press 
who was kidnapped in beirut on march 16 1985 
their ordeal has been complicated by a split in hezbollah 
between the political wing aligned with iranian president hashemi 
rafsanjani and radicals allied with former interior minister ali 
akbar mohtashemi 
rafsanjani who dumped mohtashemi from his cabinet in august 
has sought to rebuild ties with the west to attract foreign 
investment badly needed for economic reconstruction following the 
1988 ceasefire in the war with iraq 
this is anathema to the fundamentalist radicals who fear it 
will undermine revolutionary fervor and the hardline legacy of 
revolutionary leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini who died june 3 
rafsanjani appears to be willing to use tehrans influence to 
free the hostages and improve irans image provided the united 
states releases iranian assets worth billions of dollars frozen in 
1979 
the virulently antiwestern mohtashemi on the other hand has 
close links with hezbollah he was a key figure in forming the 
movement in the early 1980s and masterminding suicide bomber 
attacks on us french and israeli forces that killed hundreds of 
people 
the kidnappers are radicals who owe allegiance to 
mohtashemi the source said 
an anonymous telephone caller purporting to represent the 
proiranian organization of the oppressed on earth another shiite 
faction threatened to kill waite in august unless israel freed a 
kidnapped shiite leader sheik abdulkarim obeid 
the hezbollah cleric was seized by israeli commandoes in a 
predawn raid in july on his village in south lebanon obeid was 
not released but there was no further call claiming waite had been 
slain

deflected by scarlet heat balloons released by the pilots of the 
raiding jets 
the police spokesman said yasser arafats palestine liberation 
organization was readying the station to transmit programs to the 
uprising in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
the station had been in the process of test broadcasts and was 
to be inaugurated feb 1 said the spokesman who cannot be 
identified under standing rules 
guerrillas from arafats mainstream fatah faction ringed the 
vicinity of the stricken station and stopped reporters and 
photographers from approaching pending a security check of the 
area for possible time bombs 
in jerusalem the israeli military command confirmed the two 
raids adding that all the jets returned safely to base 
it said the radio station was intended to broadcast orders to 
guerrillas in lebanon and hostile groups in the west bank and 
gaza strip 
israeli jets last year also destroyed a fatah radio station in 
south lebanon israeli army officials said the station had been 
used to transmit orders to the uprising 
smoke billowed from several parts of the stricken shantytown on 
the southeastern fringe of sidon provincial capital of south 
lebanon 25 miles from beirut 
the spokesman said several delayedfuse rockets were fired in an 
attempt to blast the underground structure of the station but no 
word on the damage was immediately available 
a formation of four israeli jets earlier rocketed outposts of 
hezbollah irans main shiite moslem ally in lebanon in the 
embattled apple province six miles southeast of sidon 
police said at least two guerrillas were killed and four wounded 
in the two rocketing sorties of the overnight raid 
the targeted bases were in the villages of ein bouswar lwaize 
mlikh and jabal safi 
the israeli command said its warplanes raided hezbollah bases 
north of the market town of nabatiyeh that were used to mount 
guerrilla attacks against israels northern border 
the raid followed two katyusha rocket attacks on northern israel 
sunday and on the zone israel has controlled in south lebanon since 
1982 
the zone is patrolled by an estimated 1500 israeli troops and 
the 3000member south lebanon army a predominantly christian 
militia sponsored by israel 
hezbollah sources in beirut acknowledged the israeli raid on 
their bases in the apple province but refused to discuss damage or 
casualties 
they fired devastating rockets on our bases said one 
hezbollah source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the fundamentalist hezbollah and the secular syrianbacked amal 
militia have been engaged in a new round of fighting in the region 
since dec 23 at least 97 people have been killed and 277 wounded 
in that confrontation by police count 
the two factions have been vying for more than two years for 
mastery of the 12 million shiites who make up lebanons largest 
single sect 
the raids were israels first and second on lebanon this year 
at least 28 people were killed and 137 wounded in israels 18 air 
strikes against palestinian and lebanese guerrilla bases in 1989

the longawaited launch of the 
hubble space telescope will be delayed from march to april because 
of a problem with one of space shuttle discoverys solid fuel 
booster rockets nasa said today 
the 17 billion spacecraft is scheduled to become astronomys 
most significant tool in expanding knowledge of the universe into 
the 21st century 
the space agency said shuttle managers decided to exchange one 
of the motor segments on the right booster rocket because there was 
a question whether a check was done properly assembly operations 
have advanced to the point where the test cannot be repeated nasa 
said 
the launch was scheduled for march 26 estimates of the delay 
range from 10 days to two weeks 
the next shuttle mission that of atlantis on a military 
mission also faces a delay of a few days in its planned feb 16 
launch the move of the spaceship to an assembly building was held 
up two days by a problem with the left main landing gear 
there also reportedly were some minor problems with the pentagon 
payload 
scientists have eagerly awaited the hubble launch since well 
before its original liftoff date in 1985 early technical problems 
and the 1986 space shuttle challenger explosion resulted in the 
long delay 
orbiting 370 miles high the telescope will look seven times 
more deeply into space and detect objects 50 times fainter than the 
best groundbased observatory

mongolias communist party daily newspaper on 
friday warned a proreform group not to push too far in the first 
official criticism of the remote asian nations fledgling reform 
movement 
a foreign source in the capital of ulan bator said the comments 
in the daily unen came after a street rally jan 13 that attracted 
up to 5000 people and several incidents of vandalism this week 
including the theft of a small statue of stalin 
the source speaking on condition of anonymity said one article 
in the paper pinpointed several leaders of the newly formed 
mongolian democratic union and said they were going too far in 
pushing for democratic reform 
it also named several journalists and a teaching assistant at 
the state university as being leaders of the union and urged them 
to stop and think before proceeding with their campaign 
a milder article written by the head of the party ideology 
department called on reformists to work together with the party 
and said the party shared such objectives as speeding up the pace 
of perestroika and carrying out electoral reform 
the mdu thought to be comprised mainly of intellectuals and 
artists staged two rallies in december that drew crowds in the 
hundreds and then held the larger jan 13 demonstration 
during the latest demonstration speakers for the first time 
criticized government leaders by name and demanded that yumjaagiyn 
tsedenbal mongolias autocratic ruler for more than three decades 
before he was purged in 1984 be put on trial 
the demonstrators were given permission for all three rallies 
and police made no attempt to interfere 
the source said that in the past week a small statue of stalin 
in front of an officers club was stolen while paint was thrown on 
the pedestal of a larger stalin statue in front of the stalin 
museum 
a statue of horloogiyn choybalsan the stalinist leader who 
carried out bloody purges of opponents and mongolian buddhists 
during the 1930s was also smeared with paint it was not known who 
was responsible for the acts 
mongolia a nation of only 2 million people scattered across a 
nation nearly the size of west europe has been a client state of 
the soviet union since the communists took power in 1921 
it has cautiously taken up the economic and political reforms 
advanced by soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev although little 
progress has been made in introducing market principles and there 
has been no serious challenge like in east europe to communist 
party rule 
no one is looking for a great confrontation such as happened 
in east europe the source said its a very different cultural 
mileau here 
the source said the mdu plans to hold another rally this sunday 
he said it was difficult to predict whether the authorities now 
that they have criticized the movement will try to stop it all 
of this is so new he said

the brigadier general stood on a 
windswept observation post overlooking the demilitarized zone and 
challenged observers friday to find a barrier like the berlin wall 
on the bleak plain below 
kim il sung is a liar can you see any concrete wall as 
claimed by him asked brig gen kang jongpil 
kim north koreas communist leader had said south korea built 
such a wall on the 2milewide dmz to block free travel between 
the nations and he called on south korea to tear it down 
kang a deputy army division commander was briefing about 100 
foreign reporters allowed for the first time to visit two 
frontline units on the 155mile border as part of seouls effort 
to disprove the north korean claim 
the identity of kangs unit was withheld as a military secret 
the korean dmz is one of the most heavily fortified borders in 
the world and sealed off by more than 15 million troops on both 
sides the nations are still technically at war since no peace 
treaty was signed at the end of the korean war in 1953 
there were no concrete walls as claimed by kim in the two south 
korean units visited by foreign reporters on thursday at kangs 
unit a 16milelong antitank obstacle was shown to the press 
i am not sure but i think this is the very concrete wall that 
kim il sung mentioned in his new years address the general said 
through an interpreter 
if we remove these tank traps it is just like giving them 
guarantee for free passage of tanks he said 
the general said kim apparently embarrassed by sweeping changes 
in east europe is believed to have mentioned the nonexistent 
concrete wall 
its nothing but false propaganda aimed at shifing 
responsibility for national division to the south he said 
the general said antitank barriers are set up along only 12 
percent of the 12mile frontline in his units sector no tank 
traps were seen at the other adjacent unit visited by the reporters 
the antitank obstacle shown at kims unit 16 feet high and 21 
feet wide at its bottom is made of rocks cement and dirt it lies 
just outside the dmz across a vast open field that formed one of 
the bloodiest battlefields during the korean war 
about 19000 troops on both sides were killed or wounded in 
battles in the plain and a nearby ridge during the threeyear war 
kang said 
at the start of the korean war north korea threw in nearly a 
third of its 250 tanks to occupy the area and they rolled to seoul 
50 miles away in three days he said 
according to the general north korea has also fortified its 
own sector of the dmz with multiple electric fences and two lines 
of antitank barriers 
kang said all south korean barriers have been built outside the 
dmz but one of north koreas antitank obstacles is located inside 
the dmz a clear violation of the 1953 korean armistice agreement 
reporters could not verify kangs claim through binoculars 
because of hazy weather 
at a nearby unit 25 miles away reporters were takne to a guard 
post inside the southern sector of the dmz where they heared north 
koreas broadcasts blaring propaganda criticizing the united states 
as well as south korea 
if yankees go home the korean peninsula will become a 
paradise the barely audible broadcasts said

hungarys top military officer friday 
called for a remarkable reform of the warsaw pact but said the 
military alliance was needed to maintain stability in europe 
winding up the first week of unprecedented eastwest talks gen 
laszlo borsits said hungary would stay in the sovietled alliance 
for the time being 
his remarks generally reflected those of other east european 
officers who have stressed their national interests over those of 
the warsaw pact they have not however talked about leaving the 
alliance 
one of the lessons after this week is the warsaw pact is still 
there said john maresca who heads the us delegation to the 
talks 
gunter joetze west germanys ambassador to the meeting noted 
the tendency of the east european countries to discuss their 
national policies 
there is no more bloc discipline everybody talks about what 
he wants said joetze 
maresca described the initial days of the threeweek conference 
as a mixed experience 
the meeting opened tuesday with gen colin powell the chairman 
of the us joint chiefs of staff and his soviet counterpart gen 
mikhail moiseyev discussing the superpowers policies 
western analysts had been eager to hear the east bloc views 
following the tremendous political upheavals there 
maresca said the first week of the closeddoor discussions had 
been marked by formality with senior military officers not 
engaging in the hopedfor giveandtake 
that has been the disappointment of this week the discussion 
session he said there hasnt been a lot 
polands ambassador wlodzimierz konarski expressed relief the 
generals talks had been quiet and constructive without any 
tensions 
maresca said a key result of the gathering had been the informal 
contacts that set excellent groundwork for later discussions 
powell met privately with moiseyev and had lunch with chiefs of 
other warsaw pact nations 
joetze believed there was much more dialogue among the 
nations than he had expected 
we were afraid that the soviets would stonewall and would make 
only general political declarations he said but he said 
they did not they talked in military substance 
maresca contended though the soviets formal remarks were 
about what one would have expected at this time 
moiseyev offered a wide range of criticisms about us and nato 
policies and urged the west to follow moscows lead in cutting 
troops arms and spending 
the soviets allies appeared more open theres something of a 
contrast between the behavior of the eastern europeans and the 
behavior of the soviets maresca said 
poland released a detailed paper on its defense forces that gave 
not only budget and manpower figures but also naval insignia 
borsits reflecting the new eastern approach said in his speech 
that hungary no longer gives priority to military power 
the role of the military factor should be gradually but 
considerably reduced he said 
but he said the warsaw pact and the north atlantic treaty 
organization are nowadays a stabilizing factor 
their loosening would upset the balance and would lead to 
incalculable consequences he said 
but he said we consider necessary and urge a remarkable 
reform of the warsaw pact alliance above all the democratization 
and modernization of inner relationships and decisionmaking 
mechanisms 
hungary planned to cut its army by a third he said battle 
tanks field artillery and combat planes would be slashed even 
more defense spending also would come down he said 
the meeting was held under the auspices of the negotiations on 
confidence and securitybuilding measures bargaining among nato 
warsaw pact and neutral nations aimed at easing military tensions 
in europe 
the agenda for the next two weeks will include discussion of the 
structures of eastwest armed forces military training and budgets

citing declining tension in 
southern africa the government announced major defense cuts 
friday including the disbanding of air force and navy units and 
big cuts in weapons production 
the cuts mainly affect the navy and air force with naval 
personel being cut by almost 25 percent including disbanding the 
countrys marine corps the air force will lose six squadrons and 
retire five classes of aircraft 
president fw de klerk announced recently that south africa 
would reduce its defense forces because of declining tension in 
southern african and a need to redirect government spending to 
social welfare projects 
the defense budget is about 4 billion annually there were no 
figures on how much money would be saved by the cuts 
south africa last year ended its involvement in a 23year bush 
war against nationalist guerrillas in namibia by agreeing to end 
its rule of the territory namibia is scheduled to become 
indpendent soon probably in march 
south africa also withdrew its forces in 1988 from angola where 
it fought alongside rebels battling the marxist government 
lt gen kat liebenberg acting chief of the defense force said 
the cuts would make the military smaller and more economical but 
would not seriosuly reduce south africas ability to defend itself 
the defense forces will justifiably remain true to its 
reputation as a formidable fighting force that would compel any 
military force in southern africa to think twice before embarking 
on military adventures against our country liebenberg said 
the army the strongest arm of the defense forces with 75000 
troops is least affected by the cuts and will remain the strongest 
military force in africa neighboring black african states have 
much smaller weaker armies 
liebenberg said south africa still needed strong defense forces 
despite the reduction in tension in the region the threat to 
south africa has not totally disappeared he said 
the big cut involving the army was the cancellation of 11 major 
weapons systems under development the statement said another 49 
projects were reduced or delayed he said 
army operating costs will be drastically curtailed the 
statement said 
the navy the smallest arm of the military was hardest hit by 
the cuts with the closing of five naval bases disbanding of the 
900man marine corps and dismantling of the main regional naval 
commands 
liebenberg said 2000 naval personnel out of a force of about 
9000 would be dismissed or retired the south african navy is 
mainly a coastal defense force except for three submarines and two 
older frigates 
defense cuts will mean the elimination of six air force 
squadrons and the phasing out of five classes of aircraft 
including the relatively old canberra bomber and the westland wasp 
helicopter the air force has about 13000 troops and 366 combat 
aircraft

it is not necessary to define when human 
life begins to impose criminal penalties for killing a fetus the 
minnesota supreme court ruled friday 
the court in upholding minnesotas 1986 fetal homicide 
statutes said the laws do not raise the issue of when life as a 
human person begins or ends the state must prove only that the 
implanted embryo or the fetus in the mothers womb was living that 
it had life and that it has life no longer 
the justices in a 43 decision held that the fetal homicide 
statutes are constitutional even though they dont distinguish 
between viable and nonviable fetuses 
the defendant who assaults a pregnant woman causing the death 
of the fetus she is carrying destroys the fetus without the consent 
of the woman the court said this is not the same as the woman 
who elects to have her pregnancy terminated by one legally 
authorized to perform the act 
the us supreme courts landmark 1973 ruling that legalized 
abortion protects the womans right of choice it does not 
protect much less confer on an assailant a thirdparty unilateral 
right to destroy the fetus the minnesota justices said 
the opinion was issued in the case of sean patrick merrill of 
rochester who has been charged with two counts each of first and 
seconddegree murder in the november 1988 shooting deaths of 
22yearold gail anderson and her 4weekold embryo 
rochester attorney kevin lund merrills lawyer said a decision 
on whether to appeal further is expected within about a week 
olmsted county district judge o russell olson had denied 
merrills motion to dismiss the charges relating to the embryo but 
asked for a ruling on the constitutionality of the 1986 fetal 
homicide statutes 
olson said minnesotas statutes represent the most sweeping 
legislative attempt in the country to criminalize actions of third 
parties which harm fetuses and embryos 
in rejecting merrills claim that the statutes were fatally 
vague because they dont define the phrase causes the death of 
an unborn child the court split 43 with associate justice 
glenn kelley breaking from the majority justices rosalie wahl and 
am sandy keith dissented from the entire majority opinion 
writing for the dissent kelley said that without a statutory 
definition the phrase causes the death of an unborn child is 
burdened with ambiguity which invites arbitrary and 
discriminatory enforcement 
lund said he found it a a moral victory that three of the 
seven justices found the death of unborn child phrasing 
ambiguous unfortunately moral victories dont count in a 
court of law he said 
olmsted county attorney ray schmitz who defended the statutes 
before the supreme court said the justices were careful to 
separate the fetal homicide issue from abortion 
our argument was that the constitutionally protected 
relationship between mother and fetus is entirely different than 
actions of a third party and that is essentially what the court 
said he said 
the challenged statutes impose criminal penalties for murder 
of an unborn child in the first and second degrees the penalties 
of life imprisonment for conviction on a firstdegree charge and up 
to 40 years on a seconddegree charge are the same as for murder 
the statutes define unborn child as the offspring of a 
human being conceived but not yet born 
the court said it appeared merrill was claiming that because 
the statutes do not distinguish between viable and nonviable 
fetuses he was exposed to conviction as a murderer of an unborn 
child during the first trimester of pregnancy on the other hand a 
woman who obtains a legal abortion under roe vs wade and the 
doctor who performs it are not murderers 
the justices said however that the focus of the roe vs wade 
decision was on protecting a pregnant woman from governmental 
interference or compulsion

president mikhail s gorbachev friday called for 
an international program to save the environment 
speaking to the global forum on the environment and development 
for survival attended by more than 1000 political and religious 
leaders from around the world gorbachev also backed suggestions 
for the formation of an international relief agency to respond to 
ecological disasters 
he dubbed it the green cross in an obvious reference to the 
red cross 
noting that his own countrys environment has suffered greatly 
from thoughtless decisions gorbachev suggested international 
technical cooperation in preventing and repairing ecological 
damage he added that he is prepared to allow inspections on soviet 
territory to avoid any suspicion that high technology is being 
diverted to other uses 
the soviet union has only begun to recognize its own 
environmental problems in recent years since gorbachevs policy of 
glasnost or openness permitted public criticism of bureaucratic 
decisions 
the soviet environmental movement expanded dramatically after 
the chernobyl nuclear power plant explosion which devastated a 
large area of the ukraine and byelorussia 
gorbachev drew sustained applause from his audience in the grand 
kremlin palace when he repeated the soviet unions longstanding 
offer to end nuclear weapons testing if the united states agrees to 
follow suit 
he said the soviet union expects to sign an agreement soon 
providing for the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and he 
promised that soviet military maneuvers would be restructured to 
reduce environmental damage 
in the speech which ended the fiveday conference in moscow he 
called for international environmental monitoring and control that 
is another item of considerable use to the soviet union which has 
only recently begun to calculate its pollution levels the water in 
many cities is too fouled to drink and toxic waste dumps are often 
open pools of deadly chemicals 
gorbachev suggested the development of international standards 
to protect areas of particular concern for the entire world such 
as the antarctic he mentioned tropical forests coral reefs and 
lake baikal in the soviet union 
focusing on the soviet union he promised to triple the number 
of preserves of pristine wilderness in the next decade 
he also suggested that an environmental conference planned for 
brazil in 1992 be held at the highest level to approve a code 
of ecological ethics

ineke stinissen who was at the 
center of a debate on mercy killing in the netherlands died friday 
after more than 15 years in a coma she was 47 
the cause of death could not immediately be established dutch 
television reported but the nursing home in the eastern 
netherlands where she had been fed intravenously since a botched 
caesarean operation in march 1974 had stopped feeding her 11 days 
ago 
her death marked the end of a more than a decade of campaigning 
by her husband gerard for her life to be ended because her coma 
apparently was irreversible 
earlier this month the nursing home yielded to a court ruling 
allowing the medical staff to end ms stinissens life it 
previously had refused to do so on ethical grounds 
attempts by a fundamentalist dutch prolife group to obtain a 
court order to keep feeding her had failed earlier this week 
one of the key questions in the stinissen case was whether such 
a euthanasia decision can be made on behalf of a comatose patient 
since dutch euthanasia policy and practice is predicated on the 
patients request 
socalled active euthanasia has obtained quasilegal status 
in the netherlands after gradual acceptance of a set of ethical 
guidelines it is estimated that 5000 dutch patients die from 
mercy killing each year 
ms stinissens death came one day after the government 
appointed a committee of jurists to draw up recommendations for 
definitive legislation on the issue which has been debated for 
nearly a decade

bush administration spokesmen on friday 
applauded the withdrawal of some soviet warplanes from cam ranh bay 
in vietnam and said defense secretary dick cheney will discuss 
possible responses when he visits us allies in the far east next 
month 
cheney plans to travel feb 1023 to japan korea and the 
philippines three nations where the united states has major bases 
administration officials said 
the soviet announcement was not expected to lead to an immediate 
cut in us troops in the far east according to administration 
spokesmen and they said no decision was likely before april when 
the pentagon is to to complete a study on the issue for congress 
us force levels in the region are based on the longterm 
threat and our force levels are based on a rational analysis of 
that threat in the region said a pentagon spokesman lt cmdr 
edward lundquist 
we continually review our force posture and do so in full 
consultation with our allies so that we can determine the 
appropriate levels of deployment he said 
the cut in the number of soviet mig23 flogger fighters and 
tu16 badger bombers at cam ranh bay announced in moscow on 
thursday will enhance regional stability and was part of a 
reduction in soviet operations abroad over the past two years said 
lundquist 
we welcome that announcement said lundquist this is part 
of their overall reduction of overseas operations and had been 
spotted by the pentagon before the soviet statement he said 
at the state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said us 
officials anticipate that less soviet military involvement in 
southeast asia would contribute to regional stability and to 
efforts to achieve a comprehensive political settlement to the 
cambodian conflict 
last year the sovietbacked government of vietnam withdrew its 
occupation force from cambodia and an international conference met 
in paris last week seeking a political solution to the cambodian 
civil war 
the partial withdrawal from cam ranh bay was part of a general 
reduction in soviet forces in asia and around the globe announced 
at the united nations in december 1988 by soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev 
gorbachev said the soviet armed forces would be cut overall by 
10 percent pulling troops and tanks from eastern europe and 
withdrawing 50000 of its 60000 troops from neighboring mongolia 
along the chinese border beijing has demanded such a cut as a 
condition for improved ties with moscow 
neither the pentagon nor the soviet foreign ministry disclosed 
the number of aircraft withdrawn from cam ranh which was an 
american military base before the fall of the usbacked south 
vietnamese government in april 1975 
the number of aircraft they have deployed and the tempo of 
operations at cam ranh was less in 1989 than it was in 1988 and 
that was less than in 1987 said lundquist 
in moscow on thursday the foreign ministry deputy spokesman 
vadim perfiliyev said up to 10 aircraft remained at cam ranh bay 
acting within the framework of the earlier announced measures 
to reduce the numerical strength of the soviet armed forces in the 
countrys eastern section and convert them to a purely defensive 
structure in the asiapacific region the soviet union has started 
reducing its presence in cam ranh port by arrangement with the 
vietnamese side perfiliyev said 
mig23 and tu16 planes were withdrawn from there at the end

after rightists read in the newspaper that masaaki 
nakajima was active in a group working for the rights of 
foreigners they drove a militarystyle truck to his quiet 
neighborhood in suburban tokyo 
for two days nakajima says men in khaki uniforms harangued his 
family and neighbors with the trucks powerful publicaddress 
system bellowing get out of our motherland why dont you 
respect our country 
many of japans estimated 820 ultrarightist groups spend their 
time driving along city streets in darkpainted trucks blaring 
martial music or in harassing perceived opponents like nakajima 
who also heads the united church of christ japans largest 
protestant denomination 
but some rightist groups in their quest to protect their vision 
of japanese spiritual and political purity have been implicated in 
violent attacks such as the shooting thursday of nagasaki mayor 
hitoshi motoshima 
motoshima who was seriously wounded received death threats 
after saying that the late emperor hirohito shared responsibility 
for japans involvement in world war ii the leader of a rightist 
group kazumi tajiri has confessed to the shooting police said 
although the number of ultraright organizations has grown in 
recent years police estimate the membership to be about 120000 
the same as a decade ago their ideas are much the same too 
reverence for the emperor and a pure japan anticommunism 
opposition to leftist unions and liberal opinion and a willingness 
to use violence that recalls the early 20th century when 
assassination was a political tool in japan 
the groups have little public support and often instill more 
fear than respect but their highprofile activities have made 
their impact considerable 
fear of rightist reprisals along with respect for the imperial 
family has kept the question of hirohitos wartime responsibility 
a largely taboo subject attacks on newspaper offices attributed to 
rightists such as the murder of a reporter for the liberal asahi 
shimbun in 1987 have had a chilling psychological effect on news 
reporting 
there should be many opinions allowed about the emperors war 
responsibility said former nagasaki vice mayor soichi urabe 
although many people are criticizing the violence of the attack 
on mayor motoshima most people still arent considering the more 
basic issue 
police say they monitor the rightist groups but in most cases 
have no reason to take action because of the constitutional 
guarantee of freedom of expression 
however some rightists have been arrested for violating an 
antinoise law imposed in 1988 to protect parliament and foreign 
embassies 
the national police agency also has recommended tighter security 
for public figures following motoshimas shooting a police 
official said speaking on condition of anonymity 
a man who answered the telephone friday at the office of 
tajiris group seikijuku or the sane thinkers school asked that 
questions about the organization be referred to national police 
because they know all about us their information is generally 
correct 
a local police official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the group has about 30 members in nagasaki and a record of 
violence and arrests 
the group was active in the intimidation campaign against 
motoshima that began after the mayor said in december 1988 that 
hirohito then dying of cancer shares responsibility for the 
war as well as all of us who lived in that period 
a year earlier tajiri said in a tv interview that he was 
willing to kill for his beliefs because after all rightwingers 
are terrorists 
the rightists also have targeted conservative politicians and 
groups 
last year a rightist group reportedly sent a severed finger to 
prime minister toshiki kaifu to protest government debate over 
funding for imperial ascension ceremonies scheduled later this year 
in 1988 a rightist group claimed responsibility for a shotgun 
attack on the home of the founder of the recruit co a 
conglomerate at the center of a stocktrading scandal that rocked 
the governing liberal democratic party 
rightist groups around the country are thought to have links 
through which they coordinate policy and activities for example 
their decision to halt most public activities during hirohitos 
long illness as a sign of respect and the gathering of dozens of 
sound trucks from around the country in nagasaki to protest 
motoshimas remarks 
rightist groups also are generally thought to be funded by 
underworld yakuza gangs and to receive guns from them but the 
connections remain murky 
many rightists advocate a return to the prewar imperial system 
in which the emperor was considered the nations divine spiritual 
leader and power was highly centralized 
they also want to revise the postwar constitution especially 
article 9 which renounces war and the use of force to settle 
international disputes 
despite their use of the emperor as a symbol many rightist 
groups are not enthusiastic about current emperor akihito whom 
they see as too unimperial and a product of modern democratic 
society observers say in a shock for the rightists akihito also 
pledged when he became emperor to uphold the constitution 
in contrast the imperial system has been a focus of attacks by 
japans leftist extremists officials say they plan to mobilize 
about 32000 police to guard the imperial ascension ceremonies from 
possible leftist attack this fall

a revision of an agriculture department study 
unjustifiably played down the benefits of a popular 193 billion 
nutrition program designed to help poor women and children 
according to a report to congress released friday 
the general accounting office the investigating arm of 
congress said department reviewers who evaluated research on the 
socalled wic program deleted the original chapter and executive 
summaries because those reviewers believed the deleted material 
portrayed the program more favorably than justified by the data 
wic which stands for women infants and children provides food 
to pregnant women and new mothers a congressional committee plans 
to hold hearings on the gao report next week 
results of the sixyear 59 million analysis were released in 
1986 and almost immediately raised questions the gao report 
said 
according to the ga0 the departments compendium of results 
from the study substituted for the original summaries contains 
errors and misleading statements about some of the data and deletes 
the study teams overall conclusions regarding the wic programs 
impact on participants 
it added in contrast the original executive summary used 
appropriate methodology was accurately presented and reported the 
studys main conclusions that wic improves the diet of pregnant 
women and children adds to maternal weight gain increases the use 
of prenatal care and reduces preterm deliveries 
in comments included in the gao report the department said it 
agrees with gaos technical criticism of the compendium of 
results and agrees with criticisms of the delays in publishing the 
report 
however the intent of this document was not to understate the 
results nor to mislead the reader in any way said ann chadwick 
acting assistant secretary for food and consumer services it was 
written out of a genuine concern that the summary submitted by the 
contractor did not accurately characterize the results of the 
study 
the wic program began in 1972 and provides food supplements and 
nutrition education to lowincome pregnant and breastfeeding 
mothers and children up to five years old an average of about 34 
million people were enrolled in the program in the fiscal year that 
ended sept 30 
food packages contain such items as infant formula milk or milk 
products ironfortified cereal juice eggs and dried beans or 
peanut butter the packages are supposed to supplement other food 
sources like food stamps or welfare programs 
according to gao the objective of the evaluation that began in 
1979 was to provide a reliable estimate of the effects of 
participation in the wic program on nutrition and health during 
pregnancy and early childhood 
the report said that a 1987 agriculture department study showed 
about 10 million people could be eligible for wic benefits based 
on income and that study used 1984 data it said 
thus some members of congress including those who would like 
to see the wic program expanded were interested in the evaluation 
report to help make further decisions on the future of the program 
the gao report has top billing at a joint hearing on jan 24 of 
the house select committee on hunger headed by rep tony p hall 
dohio and the senate agriculture committee headed by sen 
patrick leahy dvt 
in a terse statement issued friday leahy said the 
allegations made in the gao report are very troubling i plan to 
get to the bottom of this at the hearing next week

a key to breaking racial barriers and envisioned a new south long 
before others thought it possible 
in 1932 horton helped found the highlander folk school near 
chattanooga often called the backbone of the civil rights 
movement the school educated impoverished southern workers labor 
union leaders and civil rights activists 
martin luther king jr ralph abernathy eleanor roosevelt rosa 
parks john l lewis and andrew young were influenced by horton and

president bush on friday issued an electionyear 
call for lower taxes and interest rates saying hes not satisfied 
with home mortgage rates hovering around 10 percent 
we cannot allow the high costs of housing to suffocate the 
financial life of americas young people and when it comes to 
housing this must not become a society of haves and have 
nots the president said on the eve of the first anniversary of 
his inauguration 
the 1990s must be another decade of lower taxes and lower 
interest rates 
bush spoke at the national association of home builders 
convention in atlanta before flying to miami to campaign for the 
reelection of republican gov bob martinez 
the homebuilders are experiencing hard times with housing 
construction slumping last year to its lowest level since the 1982 
recession 
bush said mortgage rates have fallen from 18 percent in the 
early 1980s to less than 10 percent 
i want to see them come down even more i am not satisfied 
at 10 percent bush said winning cheers from the audience of 
thousands of people in atlantas cavernous omni coliseum 
his remarks added direct pressure to a white house call a day 
earlier for the federal reserve to ease credit further 
bush also prodded congress to adopt fiscal policies as sound 
as those of the average american household he said any money 
saved from lower pentagon spending should be used to reduce the 
deficit instead of for new spending 
in washington senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
said friday that he hasnt decided whether to endorse sen daniel 
patrick moynihans proposal to roll back social security taxes but 
criticized bush for rejecting it out of hand 
mitchell credited moynihan a new york democrat with stating 
in very stark terms the administrations tax policy which is 
lets cut taxes for the wealthy but not the working people 
bush on thursday called the moynihan proposal a charade and 
vice president dan quayle said it was a political trap and a 
subterfuge for a general tax increase 
riding into atlanta from the airport bushs armored cadillac 
limousine billowed white smoke from under the hood because of an 
unexplained mechanical failure one aide said there had been a drop 
in oil pressure 
the motorcade stopped on interstate 75 for about two minutes 
while bush switched into a backup car

later in remarks prepared for a martinez fundraiser in miami 
bush noted changes around the world with democratic reforms in 
eastern europe and the removal of manuel antonio noriega from power 
in panama 
in fact bush said there are only two holdouts preventing 
a totally democratic hemisphere so let daniel ortega president of 
nicaragua and fidel castro president of cuba take note like the 
dinosaur the day of the dictator is over 
end embargoed material

bush toured a section of everglades national park not far from 
miami walking along wooden pathways and bridges watching 
alligators and discussing wildlife and the environment with 
youngsters from sunset elementary school who accompanied him 
as a crow cawed loudly the president sat on a stone wall 
alligators swimming in the swampy waters behind him and listened 
to a 20minute lecture on the fragile everglades ecosystem from a 
national park ranger 
as the world gets smaller we have to preserve our environment 
and protect it bush said but you cant stop everything from 
growing so you need sound management 
in atlanta bush spoke at the same coliseum where democrats held 
their 1988 convention and nominated michael dukakis to run against 
him 
bush told the homebuilders that low and stable interest rates 
are vital for homebuilders and homebuyers alike 
a 1 percent increase in the interest rate knocks millions of 
families out of the market he said adding that the best housing 
policy is a healthy growing economy with low longterm interest 
rates 
the bush white house has been reluctant to criticize the federal 
reserve but began expressing concern thursday amid signs the 
central bank would not support a further easing of credit 
after driving rates higher since early 1987 the fed reversed 
course in june since then the federal funds rate controlled 
directly by the fed has fallen about 15 percentage points to 
about 825 percent 
the federal funds rate is the rate banks charge one another for 
overnight loans 
bush used his appearances to make another pitch for 
congressional approval of a cut in capital gains taxes he said he 
wanted an upordown vote on the issue soon after the congress 
reconvenes jan 23 
the president also noted a planned march by white supremacist 
richard barrett on saturday near atlantas martin luther king 
center 
atlanta is a great and cheerful city it has proudly risen 
from the ashes of a distant past bush said and for those who 
plan to revel in a rally of hate here tomorrow let them know this 
atlantans like all americans turn their backs on bigots

the bhagwan shree rajneesh said his 
showcase of communal living in oregon would set an example for the 
world but at his death friday his commune was vacant and unwanted 
his followers scattered his memory reviled 
rajneesh came to oregon in 1981 by the time he was thrown out 
of the country in 1985 authorities were calling him the most 
notorious figure in oregon history 
he was both a charlatan and a very evil person said vic 
atiyeh the governor during the gurus years in oregon evil in 
the sense of the kind of people he gathered around him and what he 
allowed them to do and his own personal arrogance he was above 
everything 
us attorney charles turner who prosecuted the guru on 
immigration fraud charges said the 400 sham marriages among 
rajneeshs disciples that led to the immigration charges the 
poisoning of 750 people at restaurant salad bars and the communes 
vast electronic eavesdropping network were the largest cases of 
their kind in american history 
the legacy of crime that this man left here is unparalleled in 
american jurisprudence turner said 
the bejeweled guru brought his gospel of meditation and free 
love to the united states on the pretense of obtaining treatment 
for a bad back he never underwent that surgery but moved to a 
64000acre ranch his followers had purchased in the remote high 
desert of central oregon 
their stated intent was to farm the land on rancho rajneesh but 
they built homes a hotel restaurants shops an airport and a 
meditation hall and then incorporated as the town of rajneeshpuram 
after it all fell apart an insurance company foreclosed on 
rancho rajneesh but has been unable to find a buyer 
at its height some 4000 redclad disciples lived at the 
commune the gathering swelled to 15000 when followers from around 
the world came for summer festivals 
between morning and evening meditation sessions with rajneesh 
disciples toiled 12 hours a day in the early afternoon they would 
stop work and line the dusty roads for the gurus daily 
driveby in one of his more than 90 rollsroyces singing and 
swaying the disciples tossed roses onto the cars hood while armed 
guards hovered overhead in a helicopter 
sect members won political control of the nearby community of 
antelope renaming it city of rajneesh and attempted to control 
voting in wasco county by busing thousands of homeless people to 
the commune in 1984 after state officials ordered eligibility 
hearings for all new voter registration applicants in the county 
the rajneeshees and their transient guests boycotted the election 
at the time we were going through it we didnt realize how 
extraordinary it was said norma paulus who was secretary of 
state at the time i cant think of any comparable incidents in 
american history 
rajneeshs acidtongued secretary ma anand sheela was a 
fixture in the states media as she accused anyone who opposed the 
commune of bigotry 
lawsuits were filed by and against the rajneeshees on issues 
ranging from slander to the constitutionality of rajneeshpurams 
incorporation 
rajneesheeloathing spread throughout the state caps bearing 
the gurus likeness inside a rifle target were hot items 
in september 1985 sheela and about a dozen disciples left the 
commune abruptly rajneesh made accusations against her that 
triggered federal state and local criminal investigations 
rajneesh was arrested the next month during a stopover at 
charlotte nc on a flight to bermuda he pleaded guilty to two 
counts of immigration fraud and returned to india under an 
agreement with federal officials 
sheela now 39 was arrested in west germany and returned to 
oregon where she pleaded guilty to charges that included the 
attempted murder of the gurus physician with a poisonfilled 
syringe 
she also admitted poisoning several county officials and 
masterminding the salad poisonings at restaurants in the dalles 
the county seat 
she pleaded guilty to creating an electronic eavesdropping 
system at the commune and to setting fire to the county planning 
office a guilty plea to immigration fraud stemmed from charges

aid to panama is being delayed up to 45 days 
in some cases because of inappropriate intrusions by congress 
into administration affairs attorney general dick thornburgh said 
friday 
thornburgh addressing an annual meeting of the federalist 
society said the lawmakers are increasingly attempting to 
micromanage the executive branch on matters such as foreign 
affairs routine executive branch operations and even internal 
deliberations 
even today the presidents flexibility to act with dispatch 
to help our friends in panama is hampered and delayed by 
congressional caveats the attorney general said 
they were impetuously passed to stop any foreign aid or 
military support or tariff relief from ever going to general 
manuel noriega now noriega is in a miami jail because of prompt 
executive action but these regs are still on the books 
blocking help to panama in some cases for 45 days 
such provisions constitute clearly inappropriate intrusions by 
congress into executive branch management thornburgh said 
i have grave doubts that the power of the purse was ever 
intended to include the power to define our foreign relations 
and to require that congress be notified of all covert activities 
within 48 hours even if doing so could threaten american lives 
said the attorney general 
he also expressed concern about congress growing penchant for 
delegating executive power to persons not controlled by the 
president and cited the independent counsel act as an example 
i broach this subject briefly not to impugn any past or 
present independent counsel but to point out forthrightly 
present difficulties and potential dangers that arise even from 
the best of intentions when the separation of powers is ignored 
or as in this case is legislatively gotten round he said 
todays overstepping by the legislative branch does not yet 
threaten individual liberty thornburgh said but it does 
unnecessarily challenge this administrations commitment to a less 
adversarial relationship between the coequal branches of 
government 
the federalist society is named after the federalist papers in 
which alexander hamilton james madison and john jay urged adoption 
of the constitution it was founded in 1981 by three yale and 
university of chicago law students to counter what they saw as a 
liberal bias on law school campuses

sen alan cranston fighting low approval 
ratings because of his involvement with lincoln savings and loan 
said friday a former banking regulator was to blame for the sale of 
worthless bonds at the failed thrifts offices 
continuing an offensive he began early this week the senate 
majority whip renewed his attack on former chief sampl regulator 
edwin j gray as the main culprit in the failure of lincoln and 
the losses sustained by bondholders many of them elderly 
californians who lost their life savings 
cranston dcalif released documents in washington and held 
news conferences in california to paint what he called a picture 
of negligence by gray and his staff when gray headed the federal 
home loan bank board 
one of five senators under investigation by the senate ethics 
committee for intervening with regulators on lincolns behalf 
cranston has gone on the offensive this week with five news 
conferences in his home state 
three separate polls in recent weeks show his popularity with 
california voters has plunged to its lowest level ever since he 
came to the senate in 1969 
the chief document was a chronology by federal regulators it 
showed the bank board permitted lincolns parent company american 
continental corp to sell its junk bonds at the banks offices 
even though regulators questioned the firms ability to repay 
bondholders 
the bonds unlike bank accounts at lincoln were not insured and 
became worthless when american continental filed for bankruptcy 
it is unforgivable that gray was permitting the bond sales at 
a time when his regulators were raising questions about the 
financial state of lincoln and american continental cranston 
said in a statement 
gray president of chase federal bank in miami was on vacation 
and not available for comment his office said he headed the bank 
board the former name of the thrift regulation agency from 1983 
to june 1987 
state and federal officials have said previously that some 
22000 people mostly los angelesarea retirees were targeted by 
lincoln to switch nearly 200 million of federally insured deposits 
into the uninsured junk bonds after federal examiners first 
recommended closing the irvine calif thrift in may 1987 
cranston and four senate colleagues received a combined 13 
million for their campaigns and causes from charles h keating jr 
who was lincolns owner until the federal government seized the 
thrift last april 
the 2 billionplus cost for protecting depositors with insured 
accounts not the bondholders is likely to be the most expensive 
thrift takeover in history the other senators are dennis 
deconcini dariz john mccain rariz john glenn dohio and 
donald w riegle jr dmich 
by focusing on the bondholders cranston tried to disarm one of 
the most personally damaging allegations against him bondholders 
testimony that his intervention for keating made him partly 
responsible for their losses 
donations of 974000 went to cranstons campaign or to voter 
registration projects and other political causes headed by members 
of cranstons family 
speaking in california cranston said im taking this step by 
step saying that one way to help the bondholders is to enact 
legislation to waive immunity and allow them to sue the federal 
government as they can the state 
the key document released by cranston was a chronology by the 
office of thrift supervision of events surrounding the bond sales 
the document showed that early in 1987 grays regulators raised 
serious questions about american continentals financial condition 
and its ability to pay bondholders 
an internal bank board memo of feb 13 1987 for instance 
concludes that acc may not have the ability to service the debt 
in the long term the chronology said 
the regulators did not force the end of the bond sales until 
dec 30 1988 according to the chronology

498500 metric tons of us wheat at subsidized prices for delivery 
in march under a longterm grain supply agreement the agriculture 
department said friday 
f paul dickerson general sales manager for the departments 
foreign agricultural service said the wheat was sold by five 
companies which will receive subsidies under the departments 
export enhancement program or eep

unions current eep allocation of 2 million tons announced dec 19 
only wheat has been approved for sale to the soviets under the 
pricesubsidy program 
although no new allocation has been made the depletion of 
existing eep authority raises the possibility that a new one may be 
in the works depending on soviet needs 
the seventh year of the ussoviet grain agreement began oct 
1 with the latest sales the soviet union has bought more than 27 
million tons of wheat for 198990 delivery and more than 11 million 
tons of corn plus some soybeans and soybean meal all of the wheat 
was sold under eep arrangements 
in 198889 the sixth year of the agreement the soviet union 
bought about 54 million tons of wheat and more than 163 million 
tons of corn plus soybeans soybean meal and grain sorghums all 
but about 700000 tons of the wheat was bought under eep 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat the 498500 tons are equal to 183 million bushels worth 
around 69 million at recent us farm prices 
dickerson reported the subsidies at an average of 1758 per 
ton or about 48 cents per bushel 
the eep arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat and 
other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced 
prices to meet foreign competition

vice president dan quayle meeting resistance 
in his bid to visit some latin american countries will hold 
bilateral talks with six heads of state when he goes to honduras 
later this month for the inauguration of that countrys president 
his office said friday 
on a stop in panama the vice president quayle will discuss the 
possibility of us aid to repair the invasiontorn nation said 
quayle press secretary david beckwith 
in tegucigalpa quayle has scheduled meeting with the presidents 
of venezuela el salvador belize costa rica and guatemala as 
well as with the new president of honduras rafael callejas 
those discussions most likely will accomplish what president 
bush had in mind when he assigned quayle to visit the region to 
soothe latin objections to the us military invasion of panama 
beckwith said 
if the consultations are accomplished it reduces the 
urgency of visiting those countries personally beckwith said 
it will fulfill the mission 
the talks give the leaders of the latin nations an opportunity 
to meet with quayle without receiving him in their own countries 
many latin leaders have voiced objections to receiving quayle so 
soon after the dec 20 invasion of panama particularly with us 
invasion troops still in the country 
administration officials acknowledge that they were troubled by 
the reaction from the latin american nations officials said that 
while none of the leaders refused to speak to quayle they let it 
be known that this was not the best time for an american vice 
president to visit 
quayles trip to the jan 27 inauguration includes a subsequent 
stop in jamaica as well as panama 
no figures have been announced on how much money the united 
states can provide from its already strapped budget to help panama 
rebuild but quayle will be talking to them about whats 
needed beckwith said 
im sure hell be able to give them an indication of what 
might be feasible 
beckwith quoted quayle as saying that the topic of helping 
democracy take root and rebuilding panama is at the top of the 
immediate foreign policy agenda 
other administration officials have said an aid package might 
include assistance to businesses building or permanent housing for 
the displaced 
quayle also will lend moral support to the usinstalled 
government of guillermo endara one of the very points that rankles 
many latins 
endara should have to face elections or be appointed by the 
congress instead of holding power by installation of the us 
military they say endara by the account of independent observer 
groups won the may election that was invalidated by dictator gen 
manuel antonio noriega 
quayle says one objective of his trip will be to urge 
recognition of endara by the latin countries 
in jamaica he will consult with president michael manley 
although jamaica voted with the overwhelming majority in the 
organization of american states to deplore the invasion of panama 
the caribbean nation has other matters to discuss with quayle said 
one official 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity said jamaica 
bucked the regional trend and welcomed quayle because kingston 
feels the united states should not be held hostage to the action 
the united states took in panama 
bush announced jan 5 that he would send quayle to latin america 
to make explanations about the invasion which deeply offended even 
countries friendly to the united states they saw it as a 
heavyhanded invasion of panamanian sovereignty

lockheed officials said friday that three 
employees being detained in chad in a dispute over a company 
technical manual they destroyed are expected to leave sunday 
chad officials told the mariettabased aircraft company friday 
morning that it could make plans for the three technicians to 
return home said dick martin a spokesman at lockheeds marietta 
plant 
the company is confident the three employees and two wives 
will be on a commercial flight to paris sunday martin said 
the detention was due to a misunderstanding concerning a 
highly technical maintenance instruction manual that the men 
believed was not to be handed over to the chadians at the end of 
their oneyear maintenance contract said len r webb lockheeds 
director for the middle east and africa 
when the men destroyed the multivolume document they were taken 
into custody 
the technicians identified as marvin gambill ernest ruse and 
irving thrash were confined for 10 days in an ndjamena police 
barracks and since jan 15 have been kept inside the compound of 
the hotel tchadienne the african countrys top hotel 
i feel a little as though i were in a cage ruse said 
friday and the worst of it is that im afraid no one will ever 
trust us again 
webb said the three men had not been illtreated or harassed in 
any way 
the three were in chad because a purchase contract for two 
lockheed c130 military transport planes called for the threeman 
technical team from the lockheed aeronautical systemsgeorgia 
subsidiary to spend a year there teaching local technicians how to 
maintain the planes the contract ended in december 
the three men were pledged to silence about the affair by 
lockheed officials while they remained in chad and authorities 
continued to hold their passports 
webb said he believed he has resolved the problem by obtaining 
an export license for the manual from the us state department and 
getting a new copy of it into the hands of chadian officials 
webb said the three men two of them accompanied by their wives 
would fly from paris directly to atlanta

groups trying to make marijuana available for 
medical uses such as controlling nausea in cancer patients on 
friday appealed the drug enforcement administrations decision 
rejecting the move 
the dea acknowledges that marijuana has been used as a drug for 
centuries and its therapeutic potential has been noted by doctors 
for 150 years 
but the drug has been illegal in the united states since 1937 
with only a synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol thc the active 
ingredient in marijuana available for medical use dea 
administrators for 15 years have rejected bids to make marijuana 
itself available to patients most recently last month 
on friday the drug policy foundation acting as attorney for 
the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws and the 
alliance for cannabis therapeutics took the case again to the us 
court of appeals 
this will be the fifth time said kevin zeese counsel and 
cofounder of the drug policy foundation who was with norml from 
1980 to 1986 the drug policy foundation advocates treating drug 
abuse as a health problem not a criminal problem 
each time weve won zeese said but this is the first 
time the case is on the issue of whether marijuana has medical 
value 
advocates of allowing medical uses of marijuana want the dea to 
change marijuanas status as a schedule i drug which is available 
only for research to a schedule ii drug which would make it 
available for patient use 
previous court cases have been more on procedural matters such 
as whether the dea held appropriate hearings before rejecting 
applications 
on dec 29 dea administrator john c lawn rejected a 
longstanding petition to reclassify marijuana to schedule ii 
overturning a recommendation by deas chief administrative law 
judge francis l young 
young called marijuana one of the safest therapeutically 
active substances known to man and accepted as capable of 
relieving the distress of great numbers of very ill people 
young wrote that it would be unreasonable arbitrary and 
capricious for dea to maintain the old classification 
lawn wrote that young had failed to act as an impartial judge 
in this matter he appears to have ignored the scientific evidence 
ignored the testimony of highly credible and recognized medical 
experts and instead relied on the testimony of psychiatrists and 
individuals who used marijuana 
in addition lawn said young had ignored any evidence 
presented by the government 
synthetic thc is available on schedule ii for use as a cancer 
chemotherapy antinauseant marijuana also has been touted as useful 
in the treatment of glaucoma 
the government provides marijuana for free in some cases in 
which the food and drug administration has approved use of the drug 
for compassionate medical purposes however medical marijuana 
advocates say the process is timeconsuming and discourages 
physicians from applying for the right to prescribe the drug 
the fda said at least two dozen compassionate applications have 
been approved since the first in 1976 some covering more than one 
patient robert randall of the alliance for cannabis therapeutics 
who suffers from glaucoma and was the first to get the fdas nod 
said he and four others are the only patients who currently have 
government approval to use the drug 
dr c stratton hill of the university of texas md anderson 
cancer center in houston said the people i know who have used 
thc say its not better than other antiemetics or antinausea 
antivomiting drugs 
to be effective you usually have to give it in the dose that 
will cause the mind alterations hill said most patients who 
have cancer dont particularly like that because theyre older 
folks and thats disturbing to them 
hill said the use of marijuana is more an emotional issue than 
anything else its so tied up with the psychological makeup of 
the person who wants to use it that its difficult to ferret out 
what its use actually is 
but zeese said studies by a halfdozen states comparing 
marijuana and the synthetic thc for their antinausea properties 
have found marijuanas much more effective and much safer as 
well 
with thc youre taking the pure drug a much more 
mindaltering substance you see god on that stuff its like 
tripping zeese said marijuana is something the patient can 
control a cancer patient will take two smokes off a marijuana 
cigarette and thats all he needs 
zeese said the biggest problem medical marijuana advocates are 
likely to face is a general rule of law where the court of 
appeals will usually defer to the head of an agency considering 
the agency is an expert 
one thing were going to show is the agencys longterm 
bias zeese said were also going to have to demonstrate 
lawns bias as well his own all sorts of political pressures 
pressures from field efforts his law enforcement background 
dea spokesman cornelius dougherty said lawns personal 
background including promises to the wife of slain dea agent 
enrique camarena that camarenas efforts against mexican marijuana 
traffickers would mean something is not important 
the point here is that no one has proven that marijuana 
does have an accepted medical use unlike morphine and cocaine 
which are schedule ii drugs said dougherty said

the mayor of the district of columbia and a 
drug dealer who said he sold him cocaine both made appearances in 
the same federal courthouse friday for mayor marion barry the 
legal process was just beginning for charles lewis it was at an 
end 
the purpose of this hearing is to advise you of the charge 
magistrate deborah robinson told barry you are not required to 
make any statement 
the usually loquacious politician remained silent until his 
trial on a single misdemeanor count of possessing cocaine he must 
undergo drug testing once a week the mayor was seized in a hotel 
thursday night the authorities said they had pictures of him 
buying crack cocaine from a woman and smoking it 
two floors up lewis was urged by judge stanley sporkin to speak 
out 
it is often hard for others to understand how low one can 
sink said lewis how one can be bought by drugs is shown by my 
willingness to lie and not only to lie but to lie to protect the 
mayor 
lewis lied by his own admission when he denied selling drugs 
to barry in 1988 during at least six visits by the mayor to his 
hotel room barry said it wasnt so 
the government placed 16 perjury conspiracy and cocaine 
possession charges against lewis and he became cooperative in a 
plea bargaining appearance last november he told sporkin he bought 
crack for barry three times either on a street corner or at a 
friends house and said he then gave the crack to the mayor during 
the hotel visits 
im not worried at all about this barry said at the time 
he said a convicted felon like lewis will say anything in 
court trying to save his own hide 
if that was what lewis was trying to do he succeeded 
in court friday the government stood up for him 
he has shown himself to be extremely remorseful said 
assistant us attorney judith retchin 
she said the prosecution would not object if the judge sentenced 
lewis on the low end of the 15to21 month prison span available 
under federal guidelines 
lewis described the contempt i feel for my own actions and 
promised to rededicate his life to public service 
i will never again fool with the laws of society he said 
sporkin said young men with their whole lives ahead of them had 
stood before him where lewis stood and were given sentences of 10 
to 15 years 
he gave lewis the minimum 15 months subtracting time served 
he is to be released in may 
i was going to give you 18 months but the government has 
impressed me with the extent of your cooperation said the judge 
you are getting the best break i know 
i want the word to go out that cooperation is extremely 
important he said the only way we are really going to attack 
the drug problem is to have people like yourself come forward 
when he is released the judge told him i would like you to 
out and tell youngsters why they shouldnt do drugs 
that is the message that barry has been delivering when he 
speaks to young people

senate majority leader george mitchell said 
friday a proposal to roll back social security payroll taxes 
dramatizes the inequity and regressive nature of the tax 
system but he declined to endorse it 
mitchell said he was concerned about the impact that sen daniel 
p moynihans proposal would have on the federal budget deficit and 
said he would await two staff studies on this question before 
making up his mind 
but he criticized president bush for immediately resisting 
moynihans proposal saying i regret the manner in which the 
president and the white house has treated it 
bush on thursday called the proposal a charade and vice 
president dan quayle said it was a political trap and a 
subterfuge for a general tax increase 
i call on the democrat leaders of congress to give the 
american people a break and to let the house and senate work their 
will by having an upanddown vote on the capital gains tax cut 
bush said 
discussing issues facing lawmakers with the reconvening of the 
second session of the 101st congress next week mitchell used the 
social security payroll tax issue to attack bushs tax policies 
particularly the presidents quest for a cut in capital gains taxes 
the maine democrat credited moynihan a new york democrat with 
stating in very stark terms the administrations tax policy 
which is lets cut taxes for the wealthy but not the working 
people let the little people pay cut taxes for the very 
wealthy 
i think that is a tax policy that is unfair and wrong from a 
policy standpoint he said and senator moynihan has expressed 
it dramatically he said 
moynihan whom mitchell labeled as perhaps the leading expert 
in congress on social security wants to roll back the social 
security payroll tax increase that began jan 1 
moynihans proposal would save workers 7 billion in social 
security taxes this year and 55 billion in fiscal 1991 
the payroll tax paid by both employers and employees rose to 
765 percent jan 1 from 751 percent and it is levied on wages up 
to 51300 instead of 48000 that means a wageearner could pay 
as much as 3924 in social security taxes this year an increase 
of about 319 from 1989 
moynihan argues that the payroll tax should be reduced because 
mounting surpluses in the social security trust funds are being 
used to help offset large budget deficits instead of being put away 
for future retirement benefits 
in a separate session with reporters senate minority leader bob 
dole rkan predicted that moynihans plan would 
selfdestruct 
dole said the white house will soon offer a proposal of its own 
that would force the government to stop using the social security 
surpluses to reduce the budget deficit 
also friday a republican member of the house rep john porter 
of illinois introduced his own proposal for preventing use of 
surplus social security taxes to reduce the federal deficit he 
said that unlike moynihans proposal it would protect retirees 
without playing taxcut politics with the social security 
system 
porters plan which is being promoted by house republican whip 
newt gingrich of georgia would return the surplus proportionately 
to workers whose taxes created it they would not receive tax cuts 
or refunds however instead the money would go into a kind of 
individual retirement account and each workers claim on future 
social security benefits would drop as the individual account 
builds 
over a period of 50 years or so porter estimated social 
security gradually would become a private retirement system that 
would prevent congress from spending social security surpluses 
boost national savings and give workers the potential for higher 
retirement benefits than are available under the present system 
porter said 
the white house jumped on moynihans proposal and the 
reemergence of sen ernest f hollings longtime proposal for a 5 
percent valueadded tax a national sales levy as evidence that 
democrats plan to seek a tax increase 
hollings dsc aims to replace revenues lost by the social 
security tax cut and bushs own proposal to lower the tax on 
capital gains 
mitchell said friday hes against hollings tax proposal saying 
that would add to the regressivity of the tax system 
but at the same time he voiced qualms about the impact that 
moynihans proposal would have on the budget deficit 
the concern which has been expressed about it by responsible 
economists is a concern which i share he said i will 
await those studies and the opportunity to discuss the matter 
personally with senator moynihan 
i must say that his suggestion has dramatized and focused 
attention on the increasing inequity and regressive nature of the 
american tax system mitchell said 
he said it demostratees that taxes on the wealthiest people 
have been systematically and dramatically reduced in the past 
decade while taxes for the middleclass have actually risen in 
the aggregate

president bush will address a rally of 
abortion foes via telephone monday the 17th anniversary of the 
supreme court legalization of abortion his press secretary said 
friday 
bush will use the same method he did in addressing the 
washington rally last year speaking over a loudspeaker by 
telephone marlin fitzwater said before leaving with the president 
on a trip to atlanta 
on friday bush issued a proclamation designating sunday as 
national sanctity of human life day 
the prevalence of abortion in america today is a tragedy not 
only in terms of human lives lost but also in terms of the values 
we hold dear as a nation bush said 
we ask all levels of government and all sectors of society to 
promote policies to encourage alternatives such as adoption and to 
extend policies that make adopting easier for families who want 
children and can provide a loving supportive home for them 
particularly for children with special needs 
nationwide activism for abortion rights has escalated bush has 
said in recent remarks on the subject that there is room in the 
republican party for prochoice supporters as well as abortion 
foes even though he still opposes abortion except in the cases of 
rape incest or threat to the mothers life 
that posture has become the gop answer to growing sentiment 
even among its own ranks against further restrictions on abortion 
the supreme court last year gave states greater discretion in 
restricting abortion touching off a wave of activism by the 
prochoice supporters to protect abortion rights 
fitzwater said he didnt know whether bush would make a point of 
using the inclusion language when he addresses the annual march 
for life rally which will be held on the ellipse behind the 
white house 
leaders of the antiabortion movement will meet with bushs 
chief of staff john sununu and other administration officials 
but there are no plans for the president to see them fitzwater 
said 
bush told tens of thousands of demonstrators last year that 
abortion on demand is an american tragedy he said the landmark 
roe vs wade decision was wrong and should be overturned 
while abortion foes march down pennsylvania avenue and hold 
their rally prochoice groups also will hold activities 
commemorating the anniversary

a us magistrate ordered the government friday not 
to destroy any documents confiscated from manuel noriegas homes or 
offices during the panama invasion and told prosecutors to turn 
over an inventory of the evidence to the defense 
in an earlier hearing friday a federal judge refused to order 
government investigators away from defense witnesses in the case of 
a noriega codefendant but cautioned both sides to avoid 
intimidation 
the magistrates ruling came after an emergency motion by 
noriega defense attorney steven kollin who said assistant us 
attorney myles malman had traveled to panama city to inspect 
material seized by us troops 
the us attorneys office did not object to the order but 
warned it was uncertain how long a full inventory would take 
kollin told us magistrate william turnoff that noriegas case 
was peculiar in the annals of criminal justice 
this case is so different its utterly different 
kollin said when in the past has an invasion occurred and 
everything in the country was taken 
assistant us attorney michael sullivan called the defense 
request unrealistic saying it was almost impossible to determine 
which of the documents would affect noriegas case directly 
but kollin responded that the defense wanted everything 
when youre a general in an army everything is under your 
dominion and control he said 
the magistrate ordered the protection and inventory of the 
documents but cautioned that the defense must give more specific 
information on the addresses of noriegas home in panama city and 
rio hato and disclose which offices he occupied in the panama 
defense forces headquarters and fort amador 
at the request of the defense the magistrate excused noriega 
from attending the session 
after the hearing sullivan refused to comment on malmans 
reported visit to panama city 
the magistrate said the inventory of documents from the house 
must be available by thursday the day before noriegas bond 
hearing because the defense contended some evidence from the homes 
may bear on that hearing 
earlier in us district court judge william hoeveler refused 
to order government investigators away from defense witnesses in 
the case of noriega codefendant luis del cid alleged to be one of 
the former dictators righthand men 
an attorney for del cid complained to the court that 
investigators from the immigration and naturalization service 
visited the defendants wife and two friends soon after the three 
testified at a bond hearing tuesday 
these witnesses declined to go back to court today they are 
terrified said attorney samuel burstyn they are worried about 
their immigration status 
del cids wife is panamanian and the other two women are 
nicaraguan refugees 
according to burstyn the agents demanded that the women turn 
over all their immigration papers and give information about how 
they entered the united states 
hoeveler noted that the women tilsa del cid and norma and 
eglantina alvarez had offered to take custody of del cid if he is 
freed on bond 
it is important for me to get the full picture of what their 
status is hoeveler said but he added no investigator for 
either side can intimidate witnesses 
assistant us attorney michael sullivan was unapologetic about 
the visit to the three women saying it was part of a wider 
investigation but he denied an allegation by burstyn that the ins 
agents accused the women of involvement in moneylaundering to 
frighten them into silence 
the ins did have an ongoing investigation about alien 
smuggling which touched on del cid the prosecutor said we 
were seeking information about this family 
and even if no such investigation existed sullivan said the 
government has an absolute right to question witnesses 
the acting director of the local immigration and naturalization 
services richard smith said he could not comment on the case 
without authorization from washington 
after the hearing burstyn said he was satisfied with the 
judges action 
del cid a lieutenant colonel in the panamanian defense force at 
the time of his arrest just after the us invasion of panama 
faces a maximum 70 years imprisonment and 550000 in fines if 
convicted of being a liaison and courier between noriega and drug 
traffickers 
at the bond hearing burstyn read a statement from noriega 
denying del cid headed panamas intelligence agency or was a close 
aide as the government had charged 
prosecutors later acknowledged he did not head the g2 
intelligence division but they responded with a photo that showed 
noriega and del cid with cuban leader fidel castro at a 1984 
meeting the government said that meeting was to smooth out 
problems between noriega and the medellin drug cartel following a 
raid on facilities in panama they were paying noriega to protect

a convicted drug dealer who testified under 
oath that he supplied mayor marion barry with crack cocaine was 
sentenced to 15 months in prison friday after prosecutors praised 
his cooperation 
charles lewis 49 who barry has described as an old friend 
told us district judge stanley sporkin drugs have ruined my 
life and said he was the perfect example of how one can be 
bought by drugs 
the investigation of lewis who pleaded guilty to two cocaine 
conspiracy charges in november touched off a political firestorm 
for the mayor coincidentally barry appeared in the same 
courthouse an hour earlier to face a magistrate on a misdemeanor 
charge of possessing drugs 
barry was arrested thursday in a downtown hotel by the fbi 
which charged that he possessed an unspecified quantity of crack 
cocaine 
lewis has twice testified before the grand jury probing possible 
drug activities by the mayor 
during a plea bargain session in december lewis testified that 
he had supplied the mayor with crack cocaine and that an unnamed 
city official had given lewis money with which to buy drugs for the 
mayor 
sporkin said he had come to court prepared to sentence lewis to 
18 months in prison halfway in the 1521 month range of sentences 
in federal guidelines 
but the government has impressed me with the extent of your 
cooperation sporkin said you are getting the best break i 
know 
the judge also said the 15month sentence would include time 
already served meaning lewis would be released in may 
lewis had originally faced 16 perjury conspiracy and cocaine 
possession charges in exchange for prosecutors dropping all but 
two of those counts lewis agreed to cooperate fully with the 
governments continuing investigation of his ties to barry

president bush called on congress to approve 
clean air legislation friday but cautioned he will veto any bill 
that is substantially more expensive than the proposal he sent to 
capitol hill last summer 
i will only sign legislation that balances environmental and 
economic progress said the president in a letter to sen bob 
dole rkan the senate minority leader 
bush noting that the senate is planning next week to begin 
floor action on a tough air pollution control bill said the 
proposal is twice as costly as the administration proposal and the 
one under consideration in the house 
the cost to industry of toughening the nations air pollution 
controls is expected to be a major subject of debate as the 
legislation moves forward in congress in the coming months 
senate democrats have said in recent days that their bill is not 
substantially higher in cost from the bush proposal but the 
president in his letter to dole said administration estimates put 
its price tag at more than 40 billion a year compared to 19 
billion for the administration proposal 
at the same time maintained the president the senate bill 
provides little incremental environmental benefit over house 
and administration versions 
environmentalists have maintained the senate bill is much 
stronger and should be enacted 
the presidents letter was made public by dole several hours 
after senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine called for 
quick senate action on clean air legislation calling it a high 
priority for me and for the president 
mitchell made no reference to bushs letter 
he said he anticipated a vigorous floor debate on the 
legislation over the next few weeks mitchell said that if clean 
air legislation is not enacted this year the countrys leadership 
in environmental issues will be called into question worldwide 
clean air bills in both the senate and house call for a 10 
million ton reduction in acid rain pollutants tighter auto 
emission standards and a requirement that a broad range of 
industrial plants and businesses install best available 
technology to capture toxic chemical releases 
the senate bill passed by the environment and public works 
committee last november however includes several second stage 
provisions that the administration and most of industry oppose as 
being too costly 
one provision would require automakers to meet a second round of 
emission curbs beginning in the year 2003 while another would 
require industry to comply with a healthbased standard on toxic 
chemical releases not related to what emission control equipment 
might be available 
supporters of the legislation have argued that the tougher bill 
would not be sustantially more expensive and that industry and 
administration cost estimates are exaggerated 
in his letter to dole the president outlined some provisions a 
bill must have for him to sign it into law these include that it 
contain no national electricity tax to help pay for acid rain curbs 
at the dirtiest electric utilities that a bill achieve overall 
pollution reduction levels he outlined in his proposal and that 
the controls not exceed his administration bill cost estimates by 
more than 10 percent 
in a related development the american lung association said 
friday that the tougher senate clean air bill with its stronger 
auto emissions curbs are needed to reduce air pollution to healthy 
levels 
the group releasing two studies on the effects of dirty air on 
health costs said current health costs stemming from air pollution 
is estimated to be 40 billion to 50 billion a year with about 
half of that coming from auto emissions 
five years ago the highrange estimate was 40 billion a 
year today 40 billion has become the best estimate for midrange 
of the health costs said fran dumelle director of government 
relations for the association

environmental advocates asked the 
environmental protection agency to turn love canal into a research 
center rather than permit new york state officials to permit 
resettlement of the old neighborhood whose name symbolized toxic 
chemical waste 
a meeting with epa administrator william reilly and other agency 
officials took place at the request of lois marie gibbs head of 
the love canal neighborhood association and executive director of 
the citizens clearinghouse for hazardous wastes in arlington va 
the agency and the bush administration would look really 
terrible if they agreed to resettle love canal gibbs said after 
the meeting 
gibbs and the other environmentalists object to a 1988 
habitability study which some officials are using to justify plans 
to move people back into the neighborhood in niagara falls ny 
the concern that we have is that the people are going to come 
back they are going to be told its habitable with a careful point 
being made not to say that its safe which is sort of playing 
with words said jacqueline warren an attorney with the natural 
resources defense council who also attended fridays meeting 
love canals not cleaned up at all gibbs said its 
contained and even thats in question 
but peter slocum a spokesman for the new york state health 
department said the state believes the about twothirds of the 
area is no more contaminated than nearby residential neighborhoods 
he said the environmentalists object to resettling love canal 
because they dont want to lose the symbol of love canal and feel 
that somehow if people are allowed to live there again the 
symbolic value of that tragic mistake will be lost 
the canal was used by the hooker chemical co to dump tons of 
chemical wastes in the 1940s in the 1950s the canal was covered 
and homes and an elementary school were built on top in the 1970s 
that residents began to notice foul smells in their basements and 
oily puddles in their yards eventually the federal government 
declared the neighborhood a disaster area and evacuated the 
residents of 728 houses in a 50block area 
lew crampton associate epa administrator said the agency would 
take the next three weeks to study gibbs proposal to establish a 
research and development center in the neighborhood

an italian senator who was in albania for three days 
this week said friday he saw no sign of a security crackdown in 
that hardline communist country 
sen giulio orlandos comments contradict reports from the media 
in yugoslavia which shares a border with the closed country that 
there has been widespread unrest this month in several albanian 
cities 
orlando said he spent a day in the capital tirana a day in 
shkodra a city near yugoslavias border that according to a 
yugoslav newspaper report on jan 11 was wracked with protests and 
a halfday in berati 
albania keeps its borders sealed to most foreign travelers so 
assessments by the few who do get in helps evaluate the internal 
situation in one of the last countries to follow strict 
staliniststyle communism 
there was no sign of barricades no heavy presence of 
soldiers no tanks the senator told the associated press in a 
telephone interview there was the normal presence of soldiers 
nothing to astonish me no sign of a state of emergency he said 
albania has denounced the reports of unrest and security 
crackdowns as slanders that it blamed on serbian nationalists 
in yugoslavia 
orlando a christian democrat who specializes in foreign 
affairs said the visit was his third to albania since 1988 
in the southern part the greek part there have been some it 
seems i wont say revolt but requests on the part of greek 
orthodox officials for religious liberty orlando said 
in an interview that appeared friday in romes la repubblica 
newspaper orlando said the albanians in berati were restoring 
three beautiful orthodox churches everything was calm there 
in the telephone interview the senator said it was his 
impression in talks with foreign ministry and other officials that 
the present leadership is continuing albanias policy of 
political isolation 
however he said theres a strong push to modernize the 
country technologically in a direction that requires a certain 
openness 
orlando said he urged albanian authorities to sign the helsinki 
accords on human rights and told them a meeting of balkan nation 
foreign ministers set for october in tirana would be an opportunity 
to discuss increasing freedom 
for the moment their answer was negative to a certain 
point i had the impression that becoming a signatory to 
helsinki was under consideration that the matter was under 
reflection 
orlando said he thought the albanian authorities were open to 
the idea of establishing some kind of institution among balkan 
nations to monitor rights of minorities 
the senator said it appeared that albanian authorities seemed to 
be realizing that the national policy of isolation didnt pay 
albanian authorities he said expressed resolve to work with 
italy greece and yugoslavia in tackling pollution problems in the 
adriatic sea

secretary of state james a baker iii faced 
with eliminating foreign aid this year to more than a dozen 
friendly nations sought congressional support friday to disregard 
some legal restrictions on how aid money is distributed 
baker met with senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
and minority leader bob dole rkan to see whether lawmakers 
might permit some flexibility in the socalled earmarks 
congress imposed on fiscal 1990 foreign aid money 
dole said baker complained that the administration has a list of 
some 30 countries to which it wants to give a total of 16 
billion but has only 950 million in unearmarked money to hand 
out leaving a 650 million shortfall 
state department officials have come up with a series of 
scenarios under which some of the earmarked money roughly from 
150 million to 250 million could be pared from its mandated 
recipients and given instead to havenots such as bolivia jamaica 
argentina peru and countries in the eastern caribbean 
some of these countries small countries important countries 
are going to be zeroed out dole told reporters he asked us if 
theres any chance leaders in the house and senate might go along 
with it 
state department officials have been agonizing over the 
allocations for this years foreign aid for weeks the allocations 
were suppose to have been decided last month but remain up in the 
air because of the shortfall 
dole said baker did not want to leave out countries that have 
been cooperating with the united states in various foreign policy 
areas they feel its going to send a very bad signal to a lot of 
countries if we cant scrape up some dough he said 
president bush has the authority under the foreign assistance 
act of 1961 to rechannel up to 250 million without regard to 
congressional instructions to meet us security interests but 
the authority is seldom used other than to meet small emergencies 
it has never been used to broadly rewrite the foreign aid bills 
priorities 
an aide to mitchell said he had taken the matter under 
advisement and planned to consult with democratic lawmakers who 
deal with foreign affairs issues 
baker indicated that easing the earmarks would not only soften 
this years money crunch but also set the tone for consideration of 
the fiscal 1991 foreign aid budget when the administration hopes 
to further its perennial goal of minimizing congressional 
directives in the bill said a senate source familiar with the 
presentation 
the idea is similar to a proposal dole advanced earlier this 
week for the 1991 budget to cut foreign aid 5 percent across the 
board to the largest recipients to provide enough money to aid 
emerging democracies in eastern europe and panama

bhagwan shree rajneesh the rollsroyce 
guru who turned a central oregon town into a tumultuous commune of 
free love hedonism and murder plots before being deported died 
friday at age 58 
rajneesh who claimed 500000 followers worldwide suffered 
heart failure according to a spokesman at rajneeshs commune in 
poona 
disciples celebrated his spirits release with songs and dance 
then carted the body to a riverside funeral pyre where it was 
cremated in the traditional hindu manner 
since december 1988 rajneesh had used the name osho rajneesh 
but in the united states he was known as bhagwan shree rajneesh he 
used the hindu honorific of bhagwan meaning god that 
rajneesh adopted after he began lecturing on meditation in india in 
the 1960s osho is a buddhist term that means on whom the 
heavens shower flowers 
in 1981 rajneesh brought his teachings of free sex and 
materialism to the scrubby hills near antelope ore drawing 
thousands of slavish disciples whose reward was the gurus daily 
driveby in one of his 93 rollsroyces many painted 
psychedelic colors and some decorated with peacocks and lacy 
curtains 
to nearby residents the commune known as rajneeshpuram was a 
monstrous intrusion 
i dont think i ever wish anybody dead but i wished many 
times that he would go back where he belongs said jean opray 
the former mayor of antelope 
rajneesh also enraged people in poona where he settled after 
being expelled from the united states in 1985 as part of a plea 
bargain agreement on immigration fraud charges 
a militant young hindu tried to stab rajneesh with a long knife 
in poona in 1980 but the case was dropped when rajneesh refused to 
testify in court 
thank god he is dead he was a living nuisance said 
hrushikesh mulganokar a retired air force chief who lives near 
rajneeshs commune in koregaon park a fashionable residential 
district of the city 
we are extremely relieved that our problems have passed 
away said buchan das a secretary of the koregaon park 
residents association 
we had no personal antipathy towards rajneesh we hated what 
his presence did to us she said referring to the open shows of 
public affection by commune couples 
with his long gray beard and hypnotic brown eyes rajneesh 
peddled enlightenment and preached that sex is fun materialism is 
good and jesus was a madman he claimed to be the worlds greatest 
lover 
rajneeshs mission was to create a new man zorba the 
buddha who would be a synthesis of eastern mysticism and western 
pop culture 
explode go totally mad jump up and down shouting the 
mantra hoo hoo hoo each time you land on the flats of your 
feet let the sound hammer deep into the sex center rajneesh 
said in the orange book his cults bible 
in 1984 he changed his views on free sex and told his disciples 
to become celebate or stay with one sexual partner he proclaimed 
that aids would kill twothirds of the worlds population 
he was both a charlatan and a very evil person said vic 
atiyeh who was oregons governor during the years the guru was 
there evil in the sense of the kind of people he gathered around 
him and what he allowed them to do and his own personal arrogance 
he was above everything 
us attorney charles turner who prosecuted rajneesh on 
immigration fraud charges said the legacy of crime that this 
man left here is unparalleled in american jurisprudence 
rajneesh the eldest of a cloth merchants 13 children 
established his first commune in poona in 1974 in 1981 he flew to 
the united states where he was to undergo back surgery the 
operation was never performed and later that year rajneesh bought 
the big muddy ranch about 120 miles east of portland 
the commune covered 64000 acres and was home to 4000 redclad 
followers who toiled 12hour days to feed rajneeshs dream of a 
model community and his penchant for expensive cars and jewels the 
crowd swelled to 15000 during summer festivals 
rajneeshpuram was incorporated as a city on part of the commune 
in 1982 disciples also moved into antelope a town of 40 people 
eventually holding all its elected offices and changing its name to 
city of rajneesh the name was changed back to antelope in 1985 at 
rajneeshs suggestion as a way to make peace with the angry 
oregonians 
rajneesh allowed his gunwielding personal secretary ma anand 
sheela to wield dictatorial control over the commune but sheela 
and several of her top aides fled rajneeshpuram suddenly in 1985 
accusing rajneesh of caring more about his wealth than his 
disciples 
rajneesh responded with allegations that led to a federal 
investigation and charges the commune had planned to take over the 
county 
he and sheela were arrested in 1985 rajneesh as he allegedly 
tried to flee to bermuda 
he pleaded guilty to two counts of immigration fraud stemming 
from charges he arranged sham marriages to keep his foreign 
disciples in the united states illegally as part of a plea 
bargain rajneesh was deported from the united states 
several countries refused to let him enter and he eventually 
returned to india in november 1985 denouncing the united states as 
a monster that should be hushed up forever 
the oregon commune which included orchards a vineyard a 
65acre vegetable farm two lakes stocked with fish and an airport 
with a 4500foot paved runway is now deserted an insurance 
company foreclosed on the property but never found a buyer 
nearly all the rollsroyces were sold many to a car dealer in 
texas most were repainted 
sheela pleaded guilty to a variety of charges including 
plotting to kill rajneeshs physician with a poisonfilled syringe 
and orchestrating a foodpoisoning outbreak that sickened more than 
750 people in the dalles the county seat as part of a plot to 
take control of the county 
several other of the gurus followers were found guilty of 
various crimes including the man who served as rajneeshpurams 
mayor david berry knapp known as swami krishna deva 
a spokesman swami chaitanya kirti said rajneesh had greeted 
followers at his commune wednesday but did not appear thursday 
because of pain on the left side of his chest 
followers greeted his demise friday as a liberation of the soul 
and celebrations began as soon as the news of his death was 
conveyed another spokesman swami prabhod said there were about 
10000 followers mostly western at the commune when rajneesh died 
music could be heard in the background as he spoke over the 
telephone from poona about 750 miles southwest of new delhi 
his body was kept in the buddha hall covered by roses for 
about one hour before disciples carried it to the banks of the 
river mulamuthu a halfmile away for cremation

a federal appeals court friday rejected a 
lawsuit contending the governments fuel economy standards for new 
cars endanger motorists by encouraging automakers to build less 
crashworthy vehicles 
a threejudge panel of the us circuit court of appeals for the 
district of columbia ruled that the national highway traffic safety 
administration regulations were reasonable 
the standards were challenged by the competitive enterprise 
institute an organization supported by foundations and industries 
that favor a nongovernment approach to regulatory issues said 
sam kazman the groups general counsel 
also supporting the suit was consumer alert a 6000member 
group that wants expanded consumer choice in the marketplace 
kazman said 
the suit charged that the governments corporate average fuel 
economy standards for the 1987 through 1989 model years increased 
the number of highway deaths as manufacturers downsized cars to 
reduce their weight and boost gasoline mileage 
the standards required that each automakers fleet of cars 
average 26 miles per gallon for vehicles sold in the 1987 and 1988 
model years and 265 mpg for 1989 if some models fall short of the 
standard others must exceed it so the overall fleet average meets 
the standard 
transportation secretary samuel skinner boosted the 1990 
standard to 275 mpg prompting a separate competitive enterprise 
institute suit that is still pending kazman said 
even tougher standards would be required under bills before 
congress to renew the clean air act a senate environmental panel 
last fall voted to require an average fuel economy standard of 33 
mpg by 1996 and 40 mpg by 2000 
automakers are fighting the proposal which they say would force 
them to discontinue all but their smallest models while consumers 
are demanding bigger more powerful cars 
at least six other bills to boost the fuel economy standards are 
pending 
the suit accused the government of ignoring the threat to safety 
posed by fuel economy standards but the court ruled that the 
agency met its legal obligation to consider the issue kazman said 
he voiced disappointment with the ruling but said it cleared the 
way for action on the second suit 
here we have a safety agency refusing to admit that one of its 
major programs kills people he said in our view the evidence 
is pretty clear that nhtsa not only ignored the safety issue but 
in fact lied about it given the even more disastrous effects 
of the 1990 standard on auto safety were hopeful of a more 
favorable outcome in that litigation 
tim hurd spokesman for the agency said were pleased that 
the court found in our favor were waiting for their judgment on 
the other half of the suit he said he was referring to another 
challenge of the fuel economy standards on environmental grounds

federal prosecutors dismissed suggestions 
friday that mayor marion barry was the victim of entrapment when he 
was videotaped by fbi agents buying and smoking crack cocaine 
but legal experts and federal law enforcement officials say 
barry may have no choice in the face of overwhelming evidence he 
used drugs to claim the government improperly lured him to a hotel 
room where bought and smoked crack 
us attorney jay b stephens said that the carefully planned 
carefully reviewed and carefully executed undercover operation 
was scrupulously fair to the defendant mr barry 
there was no entrapment there stephens told reporters on 
the steps of the us courthouse after barry appeared before a 
federal magistrate on a misdemeanor charge of possessing crack 
cocaine 
prosecutors examined evidence gathered in the yearlong 
investigation of allegations that barry used drugs and decided an 
undercover operation would comply with the law stephens said 
while not commenting specifically on the evidence against barry 
stephens indicated that his office had gathered evidence that the 
mayor was predisposed toward drug use 
where there is predisposition there is no entrapment the 
citys chief prosecutor said citing the supreme courts test on 
the issue 
the entrapment defense that law enforcement authorities led a 
defendant to commit a crime he otherwise wouldnt have committed 
must be raised by the accused at trial the high court has ruled 
that a defendant is the victim of entrapment if not predisposed to 
commit the crime that undercover police induced him to commit 
stephens cited evidence that barry went to the vista hotel on 
his own volition 
he went to the seventh floor on his own free will he put 
himself in that situation the prosecutor said 
as further indication of the governments confidence in the 
case justice department spokesman david runkel said attorney 
general dick thornburgh followed the progress of the undercover 
investigation up through barrys arrest thursday evening at a 
downtown hotel 
as a defense entrapment is difficult to raise but it has been 
successful notably in automaker john z deloreans 1984 acquittal 
of federal drug conspiracy charges 
de loreans lawyers were able to persuade jurors the automaker 
was entrapped by federal agents despite videotapes showing the 
defendant standing next to open suitcase filled with cocaine and 
saying its good as gold 
but given the strength of the governments evidence barrys 
defense would have to be entrapment even though it will be 
impossible to sell to a jury said peter tague a law professor 
at georgetown university 
an entrapment defense would open the door for government 
prosecutors to present evidence of his predisposition to use 
illegal drugs tague said 
tague said prosecutors would be free to present testimony by 
convicted drug dealer charles lewis that he sold cocaine to the 
mayor and used it with him at a downtown hotel in 1988 
even though barry was never charged as a result of that 
incident prosecutors could use lewis statements as evidence the 
mayor was predisposed to using illegal drugs tague said 
stephens statements indicated that prosecutors were ready for 
such a defense with evidence aplenty of the mayors 
predisposition toward illegal drug use 
before launching the undercover sting we reviewed all the 
evidence we developed to date stephens said 
but if barry can evoke enough sympathy among jurors he could 
persuade them he was the victim of government zeal to catch him 
experts said 
the jury can always say this guy was not willing to commit a 
crime and the government went way too far in importuning him 
tague said 
unlike de lorean barry would be accountable to more than just 
12 jurors he must answer to voters of the nations capital where 
he had been expected to announce plans to run for a fourth term

an intelligence major in the state 
security service said friday he let the political opposition know 
the sss was spying on it in the campaigning leading to hungarys 
first free elections 
maj jozsef vegvari told a news conference he was making his 
revelations in hungarys danubegate scandal because of a heavy 
conscience 
he said that besides feeding information to the opposition he 
arranged it so a video crew could film intelligence documents that 
were headed for the shredder despite a ban on their disposal from 
the chief prosecutors office 
the office has ordered an investigation into political espionage 
vegvari said the sss was acting on instructions of the ruling 
socialist party the party last year changed its name from the 
hungarian socialists workers party in an attempt by the former 
communists to maintain their grip on power in the face of the 
reformist tide sweeping the east bloc 
the newly emerging opposition groups still weak and divided 
contend that the information obtained by the governments sss on 
their tactics and candidates could give the socialists a decisive 
advantage in the march 25 elections 
draft legislation is expected next month in parliament to 
curtail security service operations 
the latest allegations drew the response old habits die 
hard from premier miklos nemeth in an interview to be published 
in saturdays edition of the daily magyar hirlap nemeth said he 
regretted not ordering a total overhaul of the interior ministry 
which oversees the sss last year 
brig gen jozsef horvath head of the ssss internal security 
service resigned on wednesday 
nemeth said the remnants of the partystate need to be swept 
away urgently and promised that the internal security 
department will be liquidated 
the interior ministry issued a statement confirming vegvaris 
status and said it initiated criminal proceedings against him for 
revealing state secrets 
the ministry rejected all charges of wrongdoing and said vegvari 
was part of an opposition political campaign aimed at undermining 
the state apparatus 
vegvari told reporters he had a crisis of conscience during 
funeral services in june 1989 for a rehabilitated imre nagy the 
reformist premier who was executed in 1958 following the 1956 
hungarian uprising against the nations stalinist regime soviet 
troops and tanks crushed that revolution 
he said events in romania were the last straw referring to 
the shooting of demonstrators by romanias secret police during the 
december revolution 
black boxan independent video newsreel group filmed 
vegvaris account of the surveillance on opposition groups as well 
as dozens of burnbags in the halls of an interior ministry 
building which allegedly contained compromising documents 
the materials included reports on surveillance of opposition 
political organizations personalities religious groups youth 
organizations writers artists and irredentists vegvari 
said referring to activists involved with hungarian minorities in 
romania czechoslovakia and the soviet union 
i am not a traitor to my country but i do wish to expose the 
illegal activities of this organization vegvari said adding

mayor marion barry preparing to fight a drug 
charge broke down in tears as he turned over some of his powers to 
an aide after stormy meetings in city hall on friday 
as the mayor was making up his mind on what to do about his job 
other officials were trying to calm nerves of agitated city 
employees 
three members of the mayors cabinet who sought to minimize the 
mayors problems were shouted down by others in a cabinet 
meeting who said they too long had been part of a conspiracy of 
silence said one cabinet member who spoke on condition that he 
not be identified 
other officials said some members threatened to resign if barry 
tried to carry on as usual the cabinet has about 50 members and 
nearly all were present 
after first saying he would go about the business of 
government despite the cocainepossession charge barry turned 
the daily routine of the dc government over to the city 
administrator carol thompson announcing his action in a tearful 
fiveminute speech said a cabinet member speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
barry retains power to veto legislation and sign contracts 
which he cannot delegate 
a statement from the mayors office said he based his decision 
to step aside for thompson on the need for time to handle his 
legal affairs his concern for his family and because it is in the 
best interests of the citizens of washington dc 
earlier in a meeting of political advisers longtime barry 
aide herbert o reid sr now the citys chief attorney argued 
vehemently against barrys yielding of any power and also against 
entering a drug treatment program while others urged the mayor to 
seek treatment 
a source familiar with decisions taken at the advisers meeting 
said a decision on entering a drug treatment program was held in 
abeyance pending further discussions over the weekend 
campaign finance cochairman jeffrey gildenhorn likened the 
situation to the richard nixon white house during the depths of 
watergate and officials said they were scrambling to calm a lot 
of nerves 
it is very important that we retain some sense of normalcy 
said city council member betty ann kane after a closed meeting to 
discuss the crisis it was very somber in there with people 
still in a state of shock everyone is concerned about being able 
to reassure people that the city is not going to fall apart 
top political supporters of the mayor who postponed plans to 
declare his candidacy sunday for a fourth term were clearly 
stunned by his arrest thursday night 
us magistrate deborah robinson allowed barry to remain free 
but ordered him to submit to weekly drug tests and set another 
hearing for feb 5 
barrys attorney r kenneth mundy said the mayor would plead 
innocent to the charge of possession of cocaine and would demand a 
jury trial 
while the council members were meeting members of barrys staff 
held a series of small meetings which one aide said were really 
to calm a lot of nerves 
there was no undercurrent of something about the mayor being 
maligned or run down said the staff member who spoke on the 
condition that his name not be used we were told to relax go 
about our work and keep a stiff upper lip 
council member john ray said city employees he had seen had 
expressions of concern shock and dismay on their faces 
i think thats only natural said ray who is one of four 
candidates competing against barry for the democratic mayoral 
nomination 
former police chief maurice turner an unofficial candidate for 
the republican mayoral nomination said the eyes of the nation 
and the world were focused on the district 
our city will overcome this incident and my prayers are that 
the mayor and his family will overcome this incident he said 
even some of the mayors biggest supporters were taking a 
waitandsee approach to his latest woes 
whatever he does i think should be governed by his desire to 
help the city said council member wilhelmina rolark a longtime 
barry backer 
when asked whether she thought the mayor should resign rolark 
paused for a moment and said his compassion for the city 
should govern his actions we dont know what the circumstances are 
yet but if the charges are true well her voice trailing 
off 
at barrys reelection headquarters gildenhorn said the arrest 
reminded him of the watergate situation i feel at this point a 
similar despair 
gildenhorns cochairman stuart long said the mayor had not 
decided whether he would run for reelection 
however reid discounted the possiblity that the mayor would 
step down 
hell be able to run the city alright reid said

bulgarias leaders on friday faced a wave 
of labor unrest as the ruling communists headed toward an 
extraordinary party congress likely to approve introduction of 
multiparty democracy and other major reforms 
the state news agency bta said friday more than 100 labor 
conflicts were registered by newly formed independent trade unions 
from dec 25 to jan 10 
the labor unrest surged into the open after bulgarias 
ironfisted communist leader todor zhivkov was deposed on nov 10 
in the reforms that swept eastern europe 
the jan 30 party congress will be the first since his ouster 
zhivkov who has aready been charged with malfeasance in office 
abuse of power and other crimes was accused in a newspaper article 
friday of having been a nazi intelligence agent in wartime bulgaria 
the allegations came in an article in the newspaper otechestven 
front which said zhivov worked out of a sofia villa in 1941 
no further details were available on zhivkovs purported 
intelligence role 
bulgarian king boris iii sided with adolf hitlers nazi germany 
in 1941 and bulgarian troops occupied parts of yugoslavia and 
greece 
zhivkov himself had leveled charges of nazi collaboration 
against the family of his chief critic reformist chudomir 
alexandrov when he kicked alexandrov off the politburo in 1988 
bta reported friday that the main strike demands included 
disclosure of company financial and technical status a cutback in 
bureaucracy dismissal of discredited managers better supply of 
raw materials and equipment and improved working conditions and 
safety 
the communists have conceded it will take years to overcome the 
nations deep economic crisis 
in a separate draft declaration to be presented at the party 
congress this month the party calls for a marketoriented economy 
it says the party favors development of a whole variety of forms 
of social ownership but does not spell out private enterprise 
documents asserting party willingness to adopt farreaching 
reforms were seen as an attempt by the communists now under 
pressure from opposition groups and radical changes elsewhere in 
the bloc to cling to power 
the party congress is set to adopt a statute that drops the 
marxistleninist label and the principle of democratic 
centralism in favor of political pluralism 
this week the communistdominated parliament abolished the 
partys guaranteed monopoly on political power thus officially 
ending more than four decades of authoritarian oneparty rule 
talks with the opposition on powersharing and democratization 
were suspended thursday because of the communist leaderships 
apparent unwillingness to provide the opposition with a voice in 
the nations radio and television 
the union of democratic forces the umbrella organization of all 
major opposition groups reaffirmed its right to criticize the 
communists in a statement read by spokesman ruben vodenicharov on 
state tv friday night 
the exercise of power by a single party means that this one 
party must be taken to account vodenicharov said 
a draft declaration to be advanced at the party congress 
carried by bta said the bulgarian communist party must be 
destalinized and established as a new type of contemporary marxist 
party it stresses the need for a radical restructuring of party 
governing bodies the ruling politburo and the policysetting 
central committee 
the political system of democratic socialism implies a 
multiparty system parliamentary democracy separation of 
legislative executive and judiciary powers guaranteed 
freedoms and autonomy of science and education it said 
the draft proposes that all party officers be elected by secret 
ballot and serve only two terms but did not specify their duration 
it calls for a supreme party council to replace the central 
committee a central control and auditing commission and a central 
commission on party ethics 
it also sets out a format for a chairmanship that would be the 
apparent successor to the politburo 
according to the declaration text quoted by bta the communist 
party is willing to recognize religious and some ethnic rights of 
the minority turks and other bulgarian moslems

un and albanian officials are working on 
arrangements for secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar to visit 
the isolated east european country a spokeswoman for the un 
chief said friday 
it would be the first visit by a un secretarygeneral to 
albania the last bastion of stalinism in eastern europe 
albanian foreign minister reis malile invited perez de cuellar 
to travel to his country when he visited the un general assembly 
last october 
nadia younes spokeswoman for perez de cuellar said no date has 
been set for the secretarygeneral to visit albania but she added 
it is only a matter of scheduling 
albanias invitation to the secretarygeneral stems from a 
higher estimation of the world bodys activities and the more 
influential role the united nations is assuming in the world 
community said sazan bejo press secretary at the albanian 
mission to the united nations 
bejo said he had no information on dates being discussed for a 
visit but un officials say the un chief is expected to be in 
eastern europe in may for visits to czechoslovakia and hungary 
a visit to albania a nation accused of serious human rights 
abuses would make perez de cuellar one of the most senior 
international officials to visit the hardline communist state in 
recent years 
albania lying between greece and yugoslavia on the adriatic 
sea is one of the most isolated countries in the world albanian 
authorities strictly limit foreign visitors and tightly control 
access to foreign broadcasts and books 
despite the restrictions there have been indications of moves 
toward opening to the outside world since the death in 1985 of 
albanian hardline leader enver hoxha hoxha broke relations with 
the soviet union in 1961 because of nikita krushchevs dismantling 
of stalinism

president bush on a twostate trip in the south 
was forced to switch limousines because of mechanical problems 
friday and then switched planes for convenience 
bush was riding into downtown atlanta to deliver a speech when 
smoke began pouring from the hood of his armored cadillac limousine 
as a result of an oil pressure problem 
his motorcade pulled off to the side of interstate 75 while bush 
transferred to a backup car that always is part of his entourage 
within minutes he was on his way again 
the disabled limousine was left at the side of the road with a 
police guard police spokesman michael powell said 
later bush flew to miami for another speechmaking appearance 
on the flight from washington to atlanta and miami bush rode on 
the large boeing 707 that traditionally is regarded as air force 
one 
however for the flight back bush chose a 12seat air force 
c20 the military equivalent of a gulfstream jet 
white house officials said bush chose the smaller plane to shave 
about 25 minutes in the flight time to camp david the presidential 
retreat in marylands catoctin mountains 
by using the smaller plane bush was able to land at the 
washington county regional airport at hagerstown md and then 
catch a helicopter for a 10minute hop to camp david 
if he had flown the larger 707 bush would have had to land at 
andrews air force base outside of washington and then take a 30to 
35minute helicopter flight to camp david officials said 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the use of two 
planes would not increase the cost of bushs travel since the 
smaller plane always accompanies him as a backup aircraft 
however bushs plane switch drew protests from the white house 
press corps because he excluded reporters on the return flight 
traditionally a press pool of at least 11 people accompanies 
the president on all travels 
in this instance however the white house refused to let any 
reporters accompany the president on the grounds there was not 
enough space

winstonsalem nc ap rj reynolds tobacco co announced 
friday it will cancel its philadelphia test marketing of a 
cigarette aimed at blacks saying the companys efforts have been 
misrepresented by smoking opponents 
the move came a day after the countrys top health official 
blasted reynolds slick and sinister cigarette ad campaign and 
said tobacco companies were putting profits above the health of the 
poor and minorities 
peter hoult rjr executive vice president of marketing said 
we regret that a small coalition of antismoking zealots 
apparently believes that black smokers are somehow different from 
others who choose to smoke and must not be allowed to exercise the 
same freedom of choice available to all other smokers 
this represents a loss of choice for black smokers and a 
further erosion of the freeenterprise system he said our 
sole purpose plainly and simply was to test market a cigarette 
among smokers who currently buy competitive products 
uptown a new menthol brand of cigarette had been scheduled for 
test marketing beginning feb 5 in philadelphia 
the company had said the ads would target blacks who as a 
group prefer menthol cigarettes rj reynolds also said 
philadelphia was chosen because its population is 40 percent black 
in a speech in philadelphia on thursday health and human 
services secretary louis sullivan accused rj reynolds of trying 
to create a culture of cancer with uptown 
we must resist the unworthy efforts of the tobacco merchants 
to earn profits at the expense of the health and wellbeing of our 
poor and minority citizens he said this tradeoff between 
profits and good health must stop 
sullivan said friday he was elated by rj reynolds 
decision 
this is a victory for the citizens of philadelphia for 
miniority citizens and indeed for all americans a victory for 
health he said 
in philadelphia leaders of about 30 organizations that had 
banded together to fight uptown expressed joy that the company 
decided to heed their opposition 
fantastic super wow responded dr carl mansfield 
president of the philadelphia division of the american cancer 
society 
thats a really responsible act by rj reynolds and i 
commend them on it mansfield said we didnt know if it the 
opposition would work but we thought we should try to get them to 
look at the social and ethical consequences of their marketing 
plan 
the rev jesse brown president of the committee to prevent 
cancer among blacks called the decision magnificent 
we are glad that rj reynolds decided to hear us he said 
we dont want this cigarette to be marketed in any city this 
sends a signal to rj reynolds that community groups can rise up 
and deal with them 
he said that sullivans public condemnation of the marketing 
plan was the icing on the cake to the local opposition 
but i think it was really the grassroots coalition coming 
together and taking the initiative that caused rj reynolds to 
shelve its marketing plan 
black men have a 58 percent higher incidence of lung cancer than 
white men and blacks lose twice as many years of life as do whites 
because of smokingrelated diseases according to the us public 
health service 
the companys promotional blitz included attempts to associate 
use of uptown with glamour and high fashion one ad featured people 
enjoying urban night life underlined with the slogan uptown the 
place the taste 
we have made no plans for the product at this point in time 
said company spokesman david fishel well just have to evaluate 
the situation

mayor marion barrys arrest on a cocaine 
charge threw the capital citys political scene into turmoil friday 
and raised new speculation concerning jesse jackson 
jackson in chicago said he was stunned by barrys arrest 
thursday night but brushed aside as inappropriate at this time 
questions about whether he would enter the washington mayoral race 
the twotime presidential candidate established residence in the 
nations capital last year amid wide speculation he would enter the 
1990 mayoral race though he said he would not be a candidate if 
barry a friend from the civil rights movement decided to seek 
an unprecedented fourth term 
barrys arrest which followed years of rumor and investigations 
of his activities drew reactions ranging from sadness to joking 
from political figures 
it raises the gary hart question how can one person be so 
stupid said democratic pollster mark mellman referring to the 
former presidential candidate whose hopes died when his secret 
relationship with a woman other than his wife was revealed 
jackson said he had spoken by phone with barrys wife effi i 
am concerned with her capacity to maintain her strength through 
that crisis he said 
later jackson was asked in an interview from ann arbor mich 
with detroit television station wdiv what the arrest of barry said 
to young black men in the city 
crisis is any public officials life sends shock waves to all 
children i dont think you should just reduce it to a blackwhite 
situation jackson replied 
somehow people who care must reach out with some sense of 
mercy and some plan for helping the mayor while at the same time 
providing adequate and fast services for all the people of the 
city he said 
jackson has held a wide lead in opinion polls over all other 
potential and announced mayoral candidates but in recent weeks 
friends have said he was moving away from a potential mayoral bid 
four other democrats have entered the race and barry had 
scheduled an announcement of his reelection campaign for sunday 
he postponed that reelection announcement following his arrest 
barry 53 was arraigned in federal court friday on a 
misdemeanor charge of possession of crack cocaine he was released 
on his own recognizance 
im going to leave here and go about the business of 
government he said leaving the courtroom but later he turned 
over daytoday charge of the city government to city administrator 
carol thompson retaining only the powers of signing contracts and 
signing or vetoing legislation that he cannot delegate 
us attorney jay stephens said barrys arrest at a downtown 
hotel was part of the ongoing investigation of a broad range of 
allegations against barry federal authorities said they had a 
videotape of barry smoking crack cocaine at a downtown hotel 
barry has repeatedly denied allegations he has used drugs 
including the allegations by a former friend who has been convicted 
on drug charges and was cooperating with authorities 
those denials were cited by members of both parties after 
barrys arrest 
he has been representing to the young people of the district 
that drugs are bad dont use them and now apparently all of 
that has been hypocrisy said rep stan parris rva a frequent 
barry critic and who is the ranking republican on the house 
committee on the district of columbia 
del walter fauntroy washingtons elected nonvoting member of 
congress said he was in shock 
ive asked the mayor what you have all asked him fauntroy 
told reporters referring to past allegations of drug use the 
man has been consistent hes said no 
rep lawrence coughlin rpa ranking republican on the house 
select committee on narcotics said with almost an incredible 
arrogance mayor barry has looked the public in the eye and denied 
ever having had drug usage and said he was telling the truth the 
example he has set is a horrendous one 
democratic national chairman ron brown said i am saddened by 
this troubling news mayor barry is entitled to his day in court 
and i believe that a discussion of the political options for the 
district of columbia should not interfere with the legal process 
which must go forward 
sen brock adams rwash chairman of the senate appropriations 
committees panel on the district of columbia said he had been 
assured by deputy mayor carol thompson that there would be no 
interruption in the processes of government 
barrys arrest came after his comments in a los angeles times 
interview had created a new round of controversy in a lengthy 
story published jan 7 barry was quoted as telling a reporter 
isnt anybody in this town can beat me im invincible he also 
was quoted as saying hah jesse dont wanna be no mayor jesse 
dont wanna run nothing but his mouth 
in that story the writer described a scene with barry in a 
latenight bar in which the mayor was quoted as saying 
cocaaaane how folks use that stuff anyhow you put it up your 
nooose no oooooooeeeeeee

a jury began deliberating friday on whether 
two former cincinnati bell telephone co installers defamed the 
company and two of its managers by accusing them of engaging in 
illegal telephone wiretapping 
the hamilton county common pleas court jury deliberated less 
than three hours before judge fred j cartolano sent them home for 
the weekend with instructions not to discuss the case with anyone 
cartolano earlier had directed the eight jurors in the civil 
trial to focus on whether statements by former employees leonard 
gates and robert draise harmed the company its parent cincinnati 
bell inc and phone company managers peter gabor and james west 
the jury must also decide whether gates and draise were 
negligent or demonstrated malice in making the statements as 
cincinnati bell gabor and west allege 
we want your common sense cartolano told the jurors 
the jury which has been hearing the case since nov 20 began 
deliberating friday afternoon since it is a civil case only six 
of the eight jurors need agree on any issue for a ruling 
cartolano on wednesday dismissed the defamation lawsuit that 
gates and draise filed against cincinnati bell leaving the jury to 
decide only the original lawsuit the company filed against the two 
former installers 
the plaintiffs sued demanding 2 million each from gates and 
draise but cartolano instructed the jurors that they must 
determine amounts to be awarded the exception is punitive damages 
which cartolano said he would determine if the jury decided to 
award them 
gates and draise accused their former employer of illegal 
wiretapping of customers including business leaders and federal 
judges cincinnati bell and its managers say the accusations are 
lies and that the company never knew of or authorized illegal 
wiretaps only federal judges may authorize installation of 
electronic listening devices 
cincinnati bell says gates and draise were out to get the 
company because it fired draise in 1979 and gates in 1986 but 
gates and draise say the company is trying to cover up its alleged 
involvement 
you have the ability to send bell and other companies a 
message were not going to stand for it draise told the jury 
he and gates are serving as their own lawyers 
cincinnati bell attorney arnold morelli told the jury that gates 
and draise should not be believed because they changed their 
stories contended they could not remember dates and other details 
of wiretaps and would not take polygraph tests morelli noted that 
gabor and west voluntarily submitted to polygraph tests 
gates and draise say they installed at least 1200 illegal phone 
wiretaps from 1972 to 1984 at the direction of gabor and west or 
cincinnati police intelligence squad members 
morelli said gates changed his story about whether gabor or west 
ordered gates to install a wiretap on thenpresident fords phone 
during fords 1975 visit to cincinnati 
draise contended that gabor ordered him to tap the phone of 
thencincinnati financier charles keating in 1974 or 1975 but he 
backed off that story when cincinnati bell lawyers showed that 
gabor was working in new york for american telephone amp telegraph 
co at that time 
wild rumors changed stories bumping into facts and refusal 
to take polygraph tests what does that say about their case 
morelli said

rollinson and wrote a letter back to him according to thurmond 
aide bill outlaw but thurmond did not forward the request to bush 
outlaw told the associated press in washington friday 
the aid to rollinson 69 of mexico beach was disclosed in 
fridays editions of the florida freedom newspapers in fort pierce 
panama city and fort walton beach 
rollinson is a selfpublished poet who says he also is running 
for the democratic presidential nomination to help counter the 
racist movement of jesse jackson democratic national chairman 
ron brown and the rest of the whiteisugly racists of the naacp 
the post of poet laureate which is appointed by the librarian 
of congress was last held by the late robert penn warren 
we handled it like any other constituency service said mark 
berry macks press secretary there was nothing in what he sent 
us that could be construed as being racist had we known about his 
campaign i think that would have made a difference 
rollinson denies he is racist and says he did not purposely hide 
his political philosophies 
i am a major candidate so i dont see how i can hide 
anything rollinson said my campaign is anything but racist 
there isnt a racist drop of blood in my body 
rollinson was in the public eye last year when vice president 
dan quayle invited him to a barbecue in washington dc as a 
member of the republican senatorial inner circle after news 
reports about the invitation the gop canceled it and beefed up 
security at the vice presidential mansion in case rollinson showed 
up 
in a press release for his 1992 presidential campaign rollinson 
wrote that mack and hutto had nominated him for the poet laureate 
position 
nomination is not the word i would use berry said 
he said macks office sent rollinsons request to be nominated 
and samples of his poetry to bushs office which forwarded the 
material to the librarian of congress thurmond and hutto took 
similar action 
the stuff we got was pretty harmless talking about walking on 
the beach and stuff like that said brian keeter huttos press 
secretary certainly the congressman does not condone racial 
overtones but mr rollinson is a resident of the congressmans 
district and we always respond to letters from our constituents

central players 
i dont think that anybody flagrantly did anything other than 
defend themselves or react to a situation a visibly upset 
corbett said 
whatever ive done in 12 years ive been here all went down 
the drain with 45 seconds of tv work last night corbett said 
it went all over the universe all over the world weve had 
calls from everywhere 
the freeforall was triggered when nc central forward derrick 
leak was fouled by nc aampt center jimmy humphries 
even people from the aampt pep band were fighting dooley 
said they were hitting people with their instruments 
the 15minute brawl put an end to the game with nc aampt leading 
3938 
two city police officers one campus security officer and four 
students were treated for cuts and bruises and released said candy

arrested in the melee with a sheiffs official reporting three and 
city and campus police reporting no arrests

school officials here are under fire from 
black leaders for giving students confederate heroes day off while 
not making martin luther king jr day a holiday 
why austin refuses and whether wittingly or unwittingly 
encourages the celebration of confederate heroes day is 
insulting said victor goode a member of the naacp 
houston dallas san antonio and fort worth schools closed to 
recognize martin luther king jr day goode said thursday during 
a news conference in front of the capitol grounds statue honoring 
texans who fought for the confederacy during the civil war 
the holiday honoring the slain civil rights leader and the one 
honoring confederate leaders robert e lee and jefferson davis are 
optional state holidays 
but there is a difference workers taking off the king holiday 
must make up that time by working one of several state holidays 
state employees taking off confederate heroes day do not have to 
make up the time and those that do work get extra compensation 
a handful of bills last year in the legislature would have 
combined the two holidays but the proposals died in various 
committees 
austin school officials responded to the criticism by saying 
that students were given thursday and friday confederate heroes 
day off because it is the end of the semester teachers use the 
time to compile grades and prepare for the spring semester 
school trustee bernice hart the only black on the sevenmember 
board said the two days off at the end of the semester are given 
to students each year one of the days just happened to fall on 
confederate heroes day this year she said 
i had no idea it was confederate heroes day ms hart said 
its simply on the calendar as the end of the semester

a civil trial involving an elderly man 
with cancer cant be indefinitely delayed as a costsaving move 
the north dakota supreme court ruled thursday 
the court declared unconstitutional a budgetinspired moratorium 
on civil jury trials in one of the states court districts 
the ruling came on a request by attorneys for bernhard odden 
80 who has prostate cancer odden of rural berwick is suing a 
motorist and the motorists employer for 650000 in connection 
with a november 1986 car accident that injured odden and killed his 
wife 
the case was scheduled for trial jan 29 but was put on hold 
along with all other civil jury trials in the district by a 
district court judge responding to a statewide effort to cut court 
spending 
well have to live with it judge james okeefe who issued 
the order said of the state supreme court ruling 
we may have to lay off somebody because of it okeefe said 
in a telephone interview from his chambers in grafton well have 
to make cuts someplace else 
okeefes order was part of a statewide effort by north dakotas 
district court system to cut 155 million from its budget okeefe 
is presiding judge in the northeast district which includes 11 
counties in the states northeastern and northcentral section 
the order didnt apply to criminal trials 
okeefes order putting trials on hold drew protests from 
oddens attorneys who argued that a lengthy delay could mean odden 
would never get his day in court 
attorneys michael geiermann and casey chapman had maintained the 
judges order could have delayed their clients trial until after 
july 1 1991 when the state begins a new twoyear budget period 
the north dakota trial lawyers association weighed in on the 
attorneys side 
the supreme courts five justices said thursday it was 
unnecessary for them to order a trial in oddens case but they 
said an 18month delay in bringing the case to trial would be 
unconstitutional 
chapman said he is satisfied with the ruling 
i think well get our result which is to get a trial in the 
case sooner than we otherwise would have he said 
district judge william neumann who is to preside over the odden 
case said it would be scheduled for trial soon 
neumann said he okeefe and the districts other judge would 
confer soon to decide new ways to cut the districts budget 
im afraid the supreme court has asked us to pull a rabbit out 
of the hat he said

greenville near the states eastern edge about 515 am 
scattering debris over a wide area and killing both men aboard

injured when a singleengine plane carrying a group on a ski trip 
in massachusetts berkshire hills crashed in the front yard of a 
home in great barrington officials said one of the injured was in 
critical condition 
the plane a piper lance was taking off from the great

by a bomb boldt said the only evidence suggesting a bomb is the 
scattering of debris he said 
the victims were identified by the darke county sheriffs 
department as richard d hovarter 53 of mt clemens mich and 
octavio julio mendez jr 42 of ypsilanti mich hovarter was

soviet moslems by the thousands converged 
on the iranian border friday in defiance of martial law imposed in 
many parts of the caucasus republics to control ethnic violence 
tehran radio reported 
a report by irans official islamic republic news agency 
appeared to indicate the soviets many of them women children and 
elderly were refugees fleeing the violence which has killed more 
than 70 people 
both irna and the radio were monitored in nicosia 
the broadcast said soviet moslems from the border town of 
dzhulfa gathered on the bank of the aras river that forms a natural 
boundary with iran chanted islamic slogans and threw messages in 
bottles to their kin gathered on the other side 
many parts of the border with iran and turkey have reportedly 
been sealed off following the outbreak of violence saturday between 
the predominantly shiite moslem azerbaijanis and christian 
armenians 
irna said thousands of soviet azerbaijanis have crossed the 
border into iran since thursday indicating parts of the border 
were still open 
it said officials in irans east azarbaijan province were making 
arrangements for tempory housing for the soviets some were staying 
with relatives while others were being put up in mosques the 
agency reported 
in an editorial irna accused the soviet government and the 
western press of trying to suppress the rights of soviet moslems by 
depicting the clashes as ethnic rather than political 
it seems that ways to suppress moslems are being paved in the 
soviet union also irna said 
the news came as moscow appealed for an end to clashes in 
azerbaijan and armenia where red army units and kgb troops were 
deployed monday to control the ethnic violence soviet soldiers and 
ethnic extremists were reported to be fighting in the streets early 
saturday in baku capital of soviet azerbaijan 
irna said the soviet shiites crossed by land into bilehsavar 
iran 125 miles southwest of baku 
iranian news media have previously reported that dozens of 
soviet azerbaijanis swam the aras to visit iran those reports 
indicated the soviets later returned 
irna did not specify how many soviet moslems crossed the border 
into iran on friday but said 5000 soviet azerbaijanis arrived in 
bilehsavar on thursday 
the soviet azerbaijanis share a common language culture and 
religion with iranian azerbaijanis who make up about a third of 
irans 55 million people there are about 6 million soviet 
azerbaijanis 
soviet azerbaijani protesters have been demanding an open border 
between the countries and tighter links with their iranian brethren 
nationalists in soviet azerbaijan are agitating for the 
establishment of a greater azerbaijan an independent oilrich 
homeland for some 20 million azerbaijanis on both sides of the 
border 
azerbaijan once wholly under iranian rule was ceded to czarist 
russia following a war in 1828 soviet dictator josef stalin sealed 
the border in 1921 separating families and the ethnically 
homogeneous peoples

of the crash 
craig martin a witness said first i heard like a rumbling 
of thunder and as i looked out i saw streaking fire going across 
the runway it didnt look like there was anything left of the 
plane 
airport officials hadnt considered closing the runways because 
of the weather and decisions on landing in bad weather are up to 
the pilot said airport manager james rodgers 
the plane left longview texas earlier friday and was headed to 
batesville ark said bill edwards a spokesman for eastman kodak

an eastern airlines jet landing here sheared off 
the top of a twinengine aircraft that touched down just before it 
thursday evening killing one person and injuring another aboard 
the smaller plane officials said 
the 710 pm collision between the eastern boeing 727 and a 
beechcraft king air 100 occurred on a runway at hartsfield atlanta 
international airport officials said no one was injured aboard 
the jetliner said airport spokesman john braden 
the two male victims were taken to south fulton medical center 
one was dead on arrival and the other was listed in stable 
condition hospital officials said there were no reports of other 
injuries 
the collision involved eastern flight 111 which originated in 
montreal and a twinpropeller plane flying from dekalb peachtree 
airport on the edge of atlanta to hartsfield about 15 miles south 
said officials with the federal aviation administration 
passengers on the eastern flight are ok no injuries said 
eastern spokesman robin matell in miami the extent of damage on 
our plane is wing damage how extensive i dont know the jet 
carried 141 passengers and a crew of eight he said 
roger myers an faa spokesman in atlanta said the eastern plane 
was completing its landing as the beechcraft was still taxiing on 
the runway 
the eastern airliner landed behind him and they collided on 
the runway he the eastern pilot was on his landing roll 
meaning the jet was still rolling to a stop myers said 
jack barker another faa spokesman said both planes had been 
given permission to land when asked if that indicated a problem in 
the control tower he replied thats under investigation 
airport spokesman braden asked to comment said i dont 
know i havent talked to them the control tower 
officials did not know yet how much time had lapsed between the 
two landings barker said although it was very close between the 
two 
myers said no fire was reported and he did not know whether 
either plane might have landed improperly causing the collision 
matell said an earlier report that the smaller plane had crossed 
the 727s path was incorrect both planes were cleared to land 
matell said 
it happened so fast it was like the plane hit something and 
sort of scooted to the side said eastern passenger mike 
whittaker we thought at first either he hit something or he blew 
a tire a friend of mine was looking out and he said i believe we 
hit something it looked like a little airplane 
i seen this debris flying everywhere terrible just like it 
flipped over and it was way up in the air terrible said rodney 
johnson an airport ground worker who witnessed the collision 
braden said the twinengine aircraft which carried no other 
passengers belonged to epps air service and was based at 
dekalbpeachtree airport he said both men aboard the plane were 
epps employees 
the top half of the twinengine plane was pretty well 
sheared off the engines are intact braden said the tail 
section also was missing 
the dead man was identified as eric thomas 30 of ackworth 
hospital officials said injured was daniel olthoff 26 of 
norcross who was described as conscious alert and talking 
but doctors were still examining the extent of his injuries 
faa officials were on the scene 
matell said the eastern flight originated in montreal stopped 
in la guardia and atlanta was its final destination 
the captain is a 23year eastern veteran said matell who would 
not release his name 
there was initial confusion about reports of a hydraulic problem 
aboard the smaller aircraft matell however said a pilot flying 
another eastern plane landing about the same time as flight 111 
declared an emergency while the pilot was lowering the planes 
landing gear because he thought its hydraulic system had failed 
he said the problem on eastern flight 56 a boeing 727 flying 
from miami to orlando to atlanta turned out to be a faulty 
indicator gauge that mistakenly signaled hydraulic failure

the sleek horse gallops around the circus ring 
with a dashing acrobat and juggler standing solidly on its back 
suddenly the rider unfurls a colorful banner of soviet and us 
flags and the audience wildly cheers 
americansoviet friendship steals the show at the moscow circus 
now on its second north american tour since ending a 10year hiatus 
in 1989 bomb threats and rallies had greeted the circus in the 
late 1970s in anger over moscows human rights policies today the 
return of american and soviet coringmasters is the big news 
also costarring this year is capitalism part of the touring 
circus is operating as an independent cooperative for the first 
time in 70 years 
its been a sensational success financially socially 
economically politically says us producer steven leber im 
not just saying this because its my show theres a love affair 
going on between these countries they dont relate like that to 
the japanese or germans 
performers in the circus actually a compilation of topquality 
acts from scores of soviet circuses say glasnost also has 
unleashed creativity and brought innovations to one of the most 
popular art forms in the soviet union 
this is a new generation of circus says svetlana nugrazov 
a star of the circus the government says it wants avantgarde 
there are no barriers now 
one such enterprising act is the 10minute finale called the 
legend in which tamerlan nugrazovs daring horsemen fling 
themselves and their horses around a darkened stage in a mock 
battle scene crashing swords and shields that flash sparks in the 
end a beautiful woman intervenes by dropping a white handkerchief 
the fighters drop their swords delivering yet another message of 
friendship and peace 
art plays a very important role said mrs nugrazov the 
peacemaking woman in her husbands act when people come to the 
circus they see that were just normal people we dont carry 
guns 
circus glasnost even extends to the clowns who once had to 
submit their scripts to censors watching for uncomplimentary jokes 
mrs nugrazov said before a recent new york opening at radio city 
music hall 
but now theyre saying things that were all so happy to 
hear things they wouldve been shot for by stalin 
the gibaduliin jugglers dazzle the audience in pitch black by 
juggling 16 flourescent juggling pins ruslan and zina gugkaev 
husband and wife perform acrobatics while balanced on either end 
of a plank some 30 feet in the air sarwat begbudi spins glasses of 
water in the air while standing on the back of a horse galloping 
around the circus single center ring 
the single ring is a major difference from us circuses which 
often have three going simultaneously american circuses more 
then 70 are active today tend to feature more color and 
pageantry while soviet circuses are more intimate with the 
audience sitting right at the edge of the circus ring soviet 
clowns also act more as ringmasters by helping to introduce acts 
as well as entertaining between them 
ironically most circus performers in the united states are 
natives of europe asia and south america where circus traditions 
are older and generally more popular more than half of us circus 
performers are imported 
some people believe its a matter of the willingness of the 
average american to subject himself to the rigors of training 
without income said robert parkinson a circus historian at the 
circus world museum in baraboo wis the thinking is that people 
who would have gone into acrobatics years ago are now going into 
athletics 
most major soviet cities have a permanent circus facility 
either for a local troupe or for traveling companies an entire 
government department soyuzgoscirk oversees hundreds of circus 
units circus colleges and performances across the soviet union 
the circus will tour the united states and canada for six 
months another circus called the crane unit because of its 
feature act with the exotic birds is also crisscrossing the 
country 
most acts in both units are new this year meaning most 
performers are seeing the united states and american audiences 
for the first time 
people not only like the circus as an art form but they like 
the soviet performers mrs nugrazov one of a few return 
performers said in her dressing room while sewing more sequins to 
her already bespeckled dress 
what can we think of the american public when they have given 
such a warm reception to us she said noting the demonstrations 
during the circus detenteera tours in 1978 and 1979 
with economic and political uncertainty at home most soviet 
performers also can bank on financial and professional success from 
the us tour the prestige pay and personal experience from a 
us tour will sustain most performers for the rest of their lives 
said coringmaster alexander makhtiser an actor who emigrated from 
moscow to new york about 12 years ago 
and performers in the socalled crane unit will make even 
more than those in the main circus unit thanks to perestroika 
leber said 
the main unit of the moscow circus once again is produced 
jointly by the official circus agency soyuzgoscirk and by leber a 
longtime producer with such credits as the jesus christ 
superstar tour and beatlemania 
but during negotiations for this years tour the soviet 
ministry of culture which oversees soyuzgoscirk objected to 
lebers contract he said that led a group from last years moscow 
circus to form a circus cooperative under a different government 
department allowing them relative freedom to sign their own 
contract with leber 
that cooperative unit is this years crane unit which leber 
hopes to take on a worldwide tour in coming years his contract 
with soyuzgoscirk for the main unit finally signed after he agreed 
to cut the optional length of his contract gives him rights only 
to us tours he said 
the problems havent affected this years success he said 
while declining to give figures he said this years twounit tour 
has done quadruple the business of last year and planning already 
has begun for next year 
but for soviet performers who must audition again for next year

general motors corp the worlds largest 
automaker may suffer from a developmental warp a systemic 
imbalance between hightech manufacturing processes and human 
capacity to use them well 
the problem is correctable says a professor who had spent three 
decades analyzing corporate structures but it will require a 
specialist a fiveyear projecttype ceo with years of 
experience to replace roger smith 
smith who will retire this year as chief executive officer 
initiated a 40 billionprogram to modernize production facilities 
in an effort to bring down costs and raise efficiency but gm 
efficiency remains low 
the reason says eugene jennings professor emeritus at michigan 
state university and a confidential adviser to corporate chairmen 
is that gm failed to develop the human organization to work with 
the technology 
specifically the new manufacturing processes were ahead of 
the available experience and knowledge of how to achieve optimal 
efficiency with compatible synchronized human organizations 
in short technology was developed beyond immediate human 
usefulness a familiar problem to anyone who owns a telephone that 
can do a dozen tricks if only they were needed or a personal 
computer that defies understanding 
says jennings gm has too many staff personnel compared to 
line too many overseeing plant people compared to handson types 
at least three too many reporting levels too many committees too 
many parts divisions with uncompetitive costs 
gm fixed costs are too high relative to variable costs and 
its general and administrative costs average several times higher 
per revenue dollar than the leanest competitition 
the statistical evidence is devastatingly clear he says 
observing that gms market share has dropped from 48 percent in 
1980 to 35 percent in 1989 and seems to be headed lower 
harbour amp associates of ann arbor mich estimates that 15 of 
the 16 least efficient plants in north america are gm and among 
the companys least efficient plants are several of their newest 
although estimates vary average profit per vehicle assembled in 
north america recently has been about 50 for gm more than 600 
for ford motor co and more than 1000 for some of the 
transplants or foreign factories on us soil 
in jennings view roger smith deserves credit for having 
tremendous vision in devising his plan to push technology far 
beyond its thenexisting level early in the 1980s 
it was a dream elegant in its conceptualization he says 
but it went so far so fast it surpassed the human capability to 
implement it quality improved but costs didnt fall the 
human aspect was a failure 
in retrospect he believes smith carried the program as far as 
any one person could and he states that no person is sufficiently 
skilled to take on such a 10year stint jennings says a 
secondstage leader should have been named 
what is needed now says jennings is a chairman with a clear 
assignement to develop the human organization that will bring down 
costs 
in his view the gm costreduction program now under way is a 
good start but it must be combined with a resizing of the 
entire company resizing is a euphemism for shrinking the company 
to an efficient level 
how much shrinkage jennings declines to estimate but john 
hammond of jd power and associates an automotive industry 
analyst has mentioned a decline to 29 percent of market share 
before stability and full efficiency are achieved 
jennings believes gm which always has promoted from within 
might have to go outside the company to find the individual suited 
for the challenge 
this idea may have had merit in an oligopolistic market where 
gm could dictate its terms says jennings good ideas are too 
rare to be the exclusive province of insiders 
whoever is chosen says jennings has an opportunity to make gm 
the best managed and lowest cost producer assuming he can mesh 
human and technological elements 
many things are in place for gm to take off he said it 
has tremendous opportunities

while making her first feature film 
sweetie jane campion was too busy to critique the story any 
message this dark comedy might carry was left to the medium itself 
the new zealandborn director saw herself as a pragmatist a 
problemsolver who used intuition rather than ideals to make 
creative decisions only upon viewing the film did she permit 
herself the luxury of a little instant analysis 
it was a surprise to me the 34yearold director said in an 
interview for me it was a personal experience when i saw it i 
thought there are things i wasnt expecting 
i was really rewarded by the effort i felt really high on 
occasion when some notes hit that were really special i always 
want the possibility that there is some surprise for you that 
something unique will happen 
with most of the cast and crew working on its first feature film 
as well sweetie does seem to unfold at its own unaffected 
pace as gentle as the trees that provided meaning for the films 
tortured australian family as dark as the lipstick worn by the 
title character 
based on an original story by campion and australian author 
gerard lee sweetie is minimalism from down under days of rage 
and days of detachment brought to theaters for a mere 13 million 
the screen for this small intimate film is filled literally 
by sweetie played by firsttime actress genevieve lemon paranoid 
and desparately insecure she receives tragically little support 
from her moody sister kay karen colston and reserved parents 
john darling and dorothy barry 
audiences are allowed to steal a glance at a family that would 
rather be left alone shes not evil she just frightened the 
mother observes but such insights are expressed only when sweetie 
is safely out of earshot once around shes at best ignored and 
at worst treated like a dog still in need of a slap behind the 
ears 
the main and most difficult dynamic was between the father and 
the daughter campion said it was obviously a history of a 
great deal of love and encouragement between them which never 
matured 
he couldnt accept her as the big fat adult self he could 
never accept that the childhood potential that she showed wasnt 
there now he never helped her to accept reality she was so 
addicted to the love that he once gave her she would seek it from 
anyone she could get it from 
campion grew up in wellington and originally preferred painting 
and plays to film but she learned quickly how to think visually 
admiring women in love performance and other films 
i was aware at an early age how much i loved daydreaming and 
storymaking how potent that was for me i think of filmmaking as 
play its work but i think its play too 
i had a fairly gentle but fairly fast introduction to 
filmmaking but i didnt want to make a feature i wasnt ambitious 
in that way 
she obtained a diploma in anthropology before attending the 
australian film and television school where she directed three 
short films peel passionless moments and a girls own 
story 
her breakthrough came in 1986 at the cannes film festival when 
peel won the palme dor for best short film that same year 
campion developed the storyline for sweetie 
i approached gerry lee and said lets do it together i 
was very worried who was going to be sweetie i felt that 
sweetie needed to be childlike believeable she had to make 
almost anything sound real 
on film the humor is dry ironic matching campions own tight 
smile and clipped accent on the set the laughter was loud and 
jolly reflected by the directors amused mischievous eyes 
we needed an atmosphere that was going to support her lemon 
being such a big character the filmmaker said we had a very 
jolly wild atmosphere she would sing songs at the top of her 
voice and all of us would just carry on we all got a bit nutty at 
times 
the film isnt about sweetie to me its about love and 
delusion and reality she seemed to be the catalyst for a lot of 
these frustrations im not interested in nutty fat girls per se 
im interested in extremes in love and friendship

the violence of colombias cocaine trade 
has reached into its prisons seriously disrupting the intended 
last stop in the nations war on the cartels the penal system 
wealth generated by the trade has dramatically increased the 
level of prison violence as inmates their pockets full of money 
bribe guards to get weapons and fight among themselves for control 
of contraband according to the systems director jaime camacho 
as drug trafficking grows so does the violence in the 
jails he said in an interview 
a private study by a criminal defense lawyer pedro elias 
rondon concluded that at la modelo a bogota jail housing up to 
3000 prisoners violence claimed the life of one inmate every day 
the bloodshed is startling rondon said 
camacho said rondons finding was exaggerated but acknowledged 
that prisoners frequently killed each other he said that many of 
the killings were committed by people settling scores carried 
over from previous illegal dealings with one another dealings 
fueled by drug money 
they kill you in here if you dont pay your debts said 
timothy crawford a us citizen held in la picota which holds the 
countrys most most hardened criminals and is considered its most 
dangerous 
crawford who has been a prisoner in la picota since his 
conviction in 1985 of drug trafficking spoke briefly to a reporter 
given a tour of the prison in the company of a guard 
during the tour one of the prisons cold bare hallways echoed 
with shouts from inmates as the reporter was led by asking 
questions when he could 
at one point the prisoners were asked how weapons made their 
way into the prison 
we pay off the guards one prisoner shouted back and the 
guard beckoned the visitor on 
prison director camacho said later he was convinced that some 
guards whose average monthly salary is 156 are easily bribed 
the prisons are not closed off from the outside world he 
explained there is a constant flow of money drugs and weapons 
across the gates 
until recently prison officials had only to contend with 
prisoners knives razors and clubs lately they began finding guns 
some of the prisoners shouting through the bars at la picota 
said that they could buy a pistol from guards for a million pesos 
the equivalent of 2300 which is affordable for a prisoner 
dealing in contraband 
on christmas day inmates of cell block one using at least one 
pistol took 18 hostages 11 guards two police officers and five 
visitors 
warden sandra urazan perez called it the worst uprising in the 
prisons history the inmates killed a guard and held the other 
hostages for two days before police freed them in an operation that 
left six prisoners dead 
camacho said he was certain the convicts got the pistol with 
the complicity of certain guards but he added that authorities 
had still not officially determined this 
the prisoners plan to flee in the guards uniforms was spoiled 
by a special police force that sealed off the cell block shortly 
after the hostages were taken warden urazan perez said 
the convicts connections to drug trafficking became apparent 
during the uprising when they issued a communique protesting 
colombias extradition policy and the slaying by police of a 
medellin cartel leader 
police shot and killed the drug trafficker gonzalo rodriguez 
gacha in a shootout dec 15 on colombias northern coast 
his followers killed rivals four days later at la modelo prison 
im convinced that the prisons will always reflect the world 
outside camacho said drug violence will continue to touch 
prisoners inside 
guards at la picota have been victims of the prisons violence 
this a tough lowpaying job that can cause psychological 
problems said one guard who refused to give his name things 
have been much worse since the uprising were all more afraid

eddie murphy may be funny but when it comes to 
language hes a linguistic laughingstock 
forget the fourletter words examine instead murphys harlem 
nights set in 1918 and 1938 and the movies inaccurate use of 
very hip phrases such as gimme five ill let you have your 
space take it easy yo and i just need a couple of 
seconds to get my head together 
or put fat man and little boy under the semantic 
stethoscope the paul newman film set during 1942s manhattan 
project bombards atomicage dialogue with the contemporary phrase 
dead meat the hip verb obsessing and the 1980s greeting 
its good to see you bro 
robert l chapman author of the new dictionary of american 
slang said of all the expressions mentioned above onlygimme 
five and bro were on the fringes of acceptable usage during 
the years in which their films were set 
everything else he said is out like way out 
while most production designers set decorators costumers 
property masters and choreographers seem to have mastered period 
authenticity a few scriptwriters are excelling as idiom idiots 
littering movies with linguistic anachronisms 
even the most conscientious writers laboring for accuracy 
occasionally stumble into embarrassing verbal time warps 
phil alden robinson the authordirector of field of dreams 
and the mid1940s period comedy in the mood plowed through 
newspapers magazines and court transcripts to collect realistic 
dialogue for the latter film 
and then i have the father say to his son in the movie 
lifes a bitch and then you die robinson said 
a few critics referred to it saying it was a mistake to use 
an 80s phrase in a 40s film they may well be right it just 
never occurred to me that the phrase wasnt something ive always 
heard 
william safire who writes the language column for the new york 
times magazine noted that robinson murphy and roland joffe 
director and cowriter of fat man and little boy stand in good 
company 
whatever they did it wasnt nearly as horrendous as what 
shakespeare did by having a clock in julius caesar because back 
in the days of julius caesar 10044 bc there were no clocks 
safire said 
syndicated language columnist jeffrey mcquain said the musical 
phantom of the opera ostensibly set in 1911 features the 
world war ii aviators expression point of no return 30 years 
prematurely 
odds for such historical gaffes increase as young writers and 
directors raised not on literature but on television and movies 
work more steadily in the industry 
lacking the proper dictionaries or professional interest the 
greenhorn circa 1785 may assume aok is ages old but its 
from the eisenhower years has hoosegow been slang for jail 
since the time of lewis and clark nope try 1860 
when budgets and time permit some scripts are submitted to 
factchecking firms such as de forest research in los angeles 
which charges 3500 and up to review a period feature for legal 
and historical problems 
a fair number of writers dont know much about inaccurate 
language said peter sloman a senior researcher at de forest 
but for those who do know it can be like listening to an 
operatic aria where all of a sudden a note comes in a third below 
where its supposed to be he said it can be that jarring 
as annoying as the big vaccination scars on indians in movies set 
in 1865 
yet research firms only serve as advisers on language and cant 
really order changes furthermore improvisational performers such 
as murphy robin williams and dustin hoffman are bound to say 
whatever comes to mind whether its in the script or not 
and sometimes too much attention to historical accuracy can 
backfire 
when paramount pictures released black rain an action movie 
largely set in japan the studios press materials and 
advertisements featured the movies title printed in japanese 
characters too bad they translated as black nane

victims of human rights abuse are 
planning a giant wave of criminal complaints after the military 
steps aside in march posing a potentially risky problem for the 
new civilian government 
the military which has ruled for the last 16 years has made it 
clear it will not tolerate prosecutions of its members even though 
it will be out of office but the victims and their relatives 
insist they will not give up their demands for justice 
the independent chilean human rights commission says it has 
124000 cases of human rigts violations duly documented ready to 
be brought before the courts immediately after the inauguration 
of the new government most of them involve military officials 
it will be a giant wave of trials said gonzalo taborga the 
commission official in charge of international affairs 
we will encourage people to bring their cases to the courts 
because justice is essential for the stability of our future 
democracy taborga said in an interview 
many chileans fear that pushing the human rights issue too hard 
could trigger a violent reaction by the military and put the new 
civilian government in danger presidentelect patricio aylwin 
takes office march 11 replacing the longtime rightwing military 
ruler gen augusto pinochet 
pinochet recently warned if one of my men is touched the 
rule of law will be broken 
pinochet who seized power in a bloody 1973 coup plans to stay 
on as commander of the powerful 60000men army he is sheltered by 
a clause in the 1980 constitucion drawn up by his regime which 
prevents aylwin from naming a new commander 
taborga dismissed the danger of a new coup as a result of the 
trials 
it will be the other way around he said the trials will 
strengthen democracy and the sense of justice 
aylwin has vowed to find the truth and do justice in the 
human rights violations but he has also stressed the need for 
extreme prudence 
he also has promised to seek compensation for many of the 
victims 
after the 1973 coup thousands of supporters of the toppled 
leftist government were detained many were killed tortured or 
confined to secret prisons or detention camps tens of thousands 
were forced into exile abroad 
francisco cumplido aylwins appointed minister of justice said 
the future government will fulfill its promise of finding the 
truth and doing justice in the human rights abuses 
we will of course act with the political caution required in 
such a complex problem combining the interests of the victims with 
the stability of the government cumplido said 
but he added we are not saying that a reason of state may 
prevent seeking the truth doing justice and compensating the 
victims 
in an interview earlier with the santiago daily las ultimas 
noticias cumplido was quoted as saying the armed forces can be 
assured that the new government is not planning a witch hunt on 
the human rights issue 
aylwin and his top aides have said any problems in the human 
rights area will be dealt with through the regular courts and not 
as some have suggested through special tribunals or commissions 
but still it will be a complicated situation for the aylwin 
government caught between the warnings from the military and the 
often impassionate pressures for justice from the victims and their 
relatives and from political groups many of them his allies 
the military government issued an amnesty law in 1978 covering 
all the abuses occurred since the 1973 coup 
aylwins platform calls for repealing or anulling that law 
but recently his aides have suggested such an action fiercely 
opposed by the military may be dropped 
cumplido told las ultimas noticias that there is an 
alternative strategy for achieving justice in pre1978 cases 
without necessarily repealing the amnesty 
he did not elaborate but the comment supported by other aylwin 
aides seemed aimed at appeasing the military on an issue that is 
widely expected to be the most sensitive in the relations between 
the armed forces and the new civilian government

in septmber 1986 bill moyers publicly worrying 
that cbs news was yielding to the encroachment of entertainment 
values left cbs and returned to public tv he has been very 
very busy there ever since 
this year will be no different on sunday jan 28 pbs 
resident philosopher and essayist launches the second season of his 
world of ideas series this one a onceaweek 52week series 
of halfhour interviews 
in march hell have a 90minute special from dday to the 
rhine his trip to europe last summer with a group of world war 
ii infantrymen who fought from the invasion of normandy in 1944 to 
germany and the wars end in 1945 
next fall hell have amazing grace a 90minute special 
about john newtons classic hymn as told by those whove sung it 
among them operas jessye norman pop singer judy collins and folk 
singer jean ritchie 
also afoot kids at risk a study of high school graduates 
who cant function in society and a 1991 special that as he puts 
it examines why college athletes can be stars on saturday and 
failures in life 
moyers first world of ideas which led off with filmmaker 
david puttnam had five interviews a week for 10 weeks with a 
varied mix of subjects 
the more leisurely second round for which moyers says he has a 
threeyear 25 millionayear funding commitment from general 
moters and the macarthur foundation is equally eclectic it starts 
with robert lucky chief of communications research at bell 
laboratories 
others on the roster include filmmaker steven spielberg 
neurophilosopher patricia churchland and playwrightdirector peter 
sellars 
as in his first batch of ideas moyers doesnt fear the term 
talking heads shots of interviewer and subject talking for 
some tv executives of the keepitmoving mtv generation talking 
heads mean many turnoffs 
sometimes they are turnoffs he concedes in his soft texas 
accent the question is are the talking heads thinking minds and 
thinking people are they interesting to watch i think the most 
fascinating production value is the human face 
moyers press secretary to president lyndon b johnson then 
publisher of newsday newspaper before finding tv a bully pulpit for 
ideas and essays is less critical of network tv news now than 
when dismayed he left that arena 
however like former cbs correspondent ike pappas he does worry 
that some of network news is dominated now by producers which 
is not itself a bad thing if they started out as reporters and 
journalists 
but if all they know is pictures and editing then the success 
of the piece is at the expense of the journalist 
still he says some network newscasts he has seen mostly on 
weekends are very good he singles out cbs saturday and 
sunday night newscast and the cbs news sunday morning that 
charles kuralt anchors 
im a big fan of kuralts show he says its the most 
visually interesting and literate broadcast on the air 
on most weeknights he says he watches cable news network 
likening its newscasts to the straightahead cbs evening news 
when walter cronkite anchored it 
cnn is doing the basic nuts and bolts of news the way cronkite 
used to do it moyers says venturing that in time ted turners 
24hour cnn will be the staple of most people 
the primary reason he says is that our work habits travel 
schedules and living habits are such now that its very hard to 
create a critical mass of audience at a given time so you have to 
be there when people want you 
will network evening newscasts eventually go the way of the 
pterodactyl moyers the former commentator on those of cbs 
doesnt know 
its hard to fathom the thinking of the people who are in 
charge of the networks now he says as long as they are making 
money out of it i think they will continue what theyre doing 
but i find it hard to believe that all three of them can be 
making money out of newscasts that are essentially alike

the agriculture department is rechecking some 
payments made under the 1988 drought relief program and 
congressional leaders are urging policy reviews after the 
associated press found widespread misapplication of funds in the 
39 billion emergency effort 
one new jersey farmer has been asked to repay 100000 after a 
federal agent read ap reports that checks went to corporations and 
farmers ineligible for disaster aid entire counties in california 
and new mexico are being investigated as well according to the 
agriculture department 
the ap found that the program became a onetime windfall for 
thousands of farmers outside drought areas whose losses were due to 
normal quirks of nature claims were approved for such common 
perils as insects sand wind cold and fungus even ineffective 
herbicide all of which were outside the bounds of the drought 
effort 
rep pat roberts rkan a member of the house agriculture 
committee called the ap series a needed story and said 
congress must try to establish safeguards to prevent problems in 
future agriculture disaster programs 
we have to set up some structures roberts said thats 
why i think the ap series and other examples have been very 
beneficial they point up the road we should not take 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said his departments 
office of inspector general probably will investigate the 1988 
relief program and likely will study the ap series which appeared 
in december 
the fact is these kinds of programs are exceedingly difficult 
to administer and they have inherent shortcomings said yeutter 
who was interviewed recently at a wheat growers convention in 
texas its not that people avoided their responsibilities or 
were cavalier in the implementation its simply that its just not 
an ideal way to deal with this problem 
the agricultural stabilization and conservation service the arm 
of the agriculture department that administered the program is 
already checking specific misdeeds spotted by the ap deputy 
administrator dan shaw said in washington dc 
the ascs says however that it wont check beyond the 22 
counties in eight states the ap examined in its investigation 
those few that i was concerned with we are checking to make 
sure corrections will be made shaw said 
shaw said other counties wont be studied because ascs officials 
dont believe serious problems exist nationwide i think the ap 
did a pretty good job he said i think you came up with the 
same problems we were having administering the program 
but dennis pryslak the new jersey lettuce grower who was 
ordered to repay the aid he received said its unfair to single 
him out just because he was mentioned in an ap story 
theres 50000 other guys out there in the same situation and 
we got caught said pryslak 
yeutter said he hoped to avoid future bigbuck bailouts either 
by improving the federally subsidized crop insurance system or 
creating a permanent efficient disaster program 
we simply cannot afford a combination of the two yeutter 
said the combination of mousetraps that were using to deal with 
natural disasters in this country is not a very desirable 
combination 
if congress chooses to finance disaster programs rather than 
subsidize crop insurance the agriculture department will go back 
and examine the problems the ap found he said 
one could put in place permanent disaster legislation that 
would be a potential substitute to crop insurance yeutter said 
once the administrative system was put in place we wouldnt have 
the kinds of problems that were cited in your articles or at least 
theyd be dramatically minimized 
the ap stories appeared amid an intensifying debate in 
washington over the value of crop insurance vs yeartoyear 
disaster relief earlier this month sen bob dole rkansas 
senior member of the senate agriculture committee renewed his call 
to strengthen crop insurance and clean up excess in farm disaster 
programs 
we were begging for disaster help for kansas wheat farmers 
last year and there were other senators fighting for the 
watermelon and pickle growers said dole spokesman walt riker 
what hes saying is lets clean up crop insurance and make it 
attractive for farmers to participate in lets not have these 
whole programs where the country is paying for ginseng root 
relief riker said 
ginseng root was among the many crops eligible for disaster 
assistance in 1988 
indeed the ap study conducted over seven months found that 
payments went far beyond the initial intent supported by almost 
everyone to save midwestern grain growers from bankruptcy growers 
collected on everything from kiwi fruit in california to christmas 
trees in connecticut checks were written for rainbloated tomatoes 
in new jersey and washedout bird seed in colorado 
rep kika de la garza chairman of the house agriculture 
committee defended the disaster relief program and contended the 
benefits to truly droughtstricken areas were camouflaged by 
abuses found by the ap 
legislation at best is an imperfect endeavor de la garza 
said therefore there are those mistakes that for one reason or 
another fall through the cracks that always happens when we do 
legislation in an emergency situation 
i would have liked to have taken more time i would have liked 
to have done more study but there was no time something needed to 
be done 
some problems the ap found such as farmers triple dipping 
by collecting disaster aid crop insurance and growing a 
replacement crop all on the same acreage were corrected in the 
1989 relief program de la garza said 
the house committee de la garza said will look into the 
reported abuses and ask the agriculture and justice departments to 
see if fraud or other illegal acts were committed 
already from word of mouth weve been looking de la garza 
said 
two weeks ago the ascs asked pryslak to return his 100000 in 
assistance within 30 days the ap had reported that his business 
exceeded the 2 million revenue limit disqualifying it from the 
federal program 
pryslak who has appealed the decision said he gave the local 
ascs office correct information and asserted he was paid through 
the agencys misinterpretation of the rules 
if i knew about the 2 million ceiling i wouldnt have taken 
the money he said 
peter dewilde the ascs director for new jersey said errors 
were made on both sides 
he didnt give us some information and some information we 
didnt ask for he said a determination of pryslaks appeal is 
expected by the end of february 
sometimes the rules are hard to interpret and then sometimes 
the rules are changed on us dewilde said we welcome any 
chance to make sure these people deserved to be paid

an iron curtain has descended across the 
continent winston churchill proclaimed in 1946 popularizing an 
image for the chain of barbed wire watchtowers walls and armed 
guards that would divide europe for 43 years as revolution swept 
eastern europe associated press correspondent marcus eliason and 
photographer diether endlicher went on a journey that took them 
from the northern end to the southern end of the continents 
ideological faultline

one crisp evening as eastern 
europe was becoming free an old man named johan pavtits sat near 
the hungarian border fence and remembered a december day in 1948 
that was when the barbed wire went up between lutzmannsburg in 
austria and zsira in hungary and soldiers came from the hungarian 
hinterland they knew little of the bonds that had tied the two 
villages for generations innocently they asked a farmer for the 
loan of his pliers so they could tighten the wires in what would 
come to be known as the iron curtain 
the world ended here but it was only half a world the other 
half was over there said pavtits gesturing with his callused 
laborers hand at the lights coming on in zsira 300 yards east 
and now the barbed wire is being taken away and the world is 
whole again 
the world is whole again it was a refrain heard constantly by 
an associated press reporter and photographer on a journey from 
travemuende the west german port where the iron curtain begins 
with watchtowers and high fences to trieste the italian port 
where it ends in a rusty shinhigh rail 
the most vivid image of the cold war was in collapse border 
walls piled in useless slabs the barbed wire from uprooted 
czechoslovak fences coiled by the roadside deserted padlocked 
watchtowers 
countryside once quiet divided and remote now was alive with 
traffic jams of east german daytrippers coming west with tearful 
villagers surging through fences to meet neighbors for the first 
time with a ferry boat making its first crossing of the elbe river 
in 44 years and with east and west german border guards who once 
glared at each other now chatting as though they always had been 
friends 
it was a time of pure euphoria when people everywhere welcomed 
each other with open arms and the politicians and armies along the 
iron curtain suddenly became mere onlookers 
the iron curtain the image popularized by sir winston churchill 
in a speech march 5 1946 at westminster college in fulton mo

on the baltic the iron curtain begins without preamble a 
string of buoys in the baltic sea and then a row of border posts 
marching ashore at the priwall peninsula at the west german port 
of travemuende 
here just weeks after east germany opened its borders is a 
sense of what the iron curtain was freedom up to the border 
markers with strollers braving the icy december wind then barbed 
wire and watchtowers looming forbiddingly out of the fog 
then six miles south comes the first sign of change the quiet 
checkpoint of schlutup buzzing with trabants the smoky little east 
german cars that have become the most immediate symbol of the new 
freedoms 
new holes were constantly opening in the 871mile chain of 
walls fence and watchtowers of the germangerman border

at hitzacker 50 miles south of luebeck a ferry toots its horn 
the last passengers scramble aboard and it chugs off on a 
sixminute voyage to the east german bank of the elbe river 
michael brese 31 is skippering the first service across the elbe 
since april 1945 when his grandfathers ferry was sunk by american 
artillery 
as soon as he had heard the border was opening he says he sent 
leaflets to the east german village across the river be at the 
fence on nov 18 were coming to fetch you 
in the past such audacity would certainly have gotten him 
arrested 
now he finds hundreds of east germans waiting for him pressing 
against the fence shouting open the gate the east german 
guards refuse but they soon cave in so many cheering weeping 
people clamber aboard that the ferry is briefly grounded 
when we were children we used to fish in the river and we 
would gaze across hoping to see maybe a face in a window or 
someone walking he says 
we had a saying the elbe has only one bank well now it 
has two banks again 
brese has punched his own personal hole in the iron curtain

zicherie and boeckwitz before the iron curtain descended 
between them the 700 villagers shared a school dairy and fire 
brigade but then zicherie became a tourist attraction where 
westerners could stand and stare at the lost eastern portion of the 
fatherland 
now the wall is open a man from zicherie walks through 
presents a glossy calendar to the east german guards in boeckwitz 
and returns beaming with pride at his contribution to german 
brotherhood 
everything we teach here has suddenly become history says 
birgit neyhaus who works at zicheries political education center 
where west germans can learn about east germany one recent day 
she says the unthinkable happened an east german teacher showed 
up to ask her whether he could bring in his class to learn about 
west germany

from stettin in the baltic to trieste in the adriatic an iron 
curtain has descended across the continent 
so declared winston churchill on march 5 1946 in a speech to 
westminster college in fulton mo 
behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of 
central and eastern europe he said 
the wartime british prime minister had it almost right as 
things later turned out the iron curtain started at the west 
german port of travemuende on the baltic sea about 150 miles west 
of the polish port of stettin in 1946 the division of germany 
into separate states was not yet envisaged stettin now szczecin 
lies near what is today the eastern border of east germany 
churchill did not coin the term iron curtain a british 
newspaper had used it the year before to define europes postworld 
war ii ideological divide but it was churchills speech that 
popularized it as an image of the cold war

mk pete peterson trusted his stockbroker 
he says that was his mistake 
the 70yearold retired corporate executive claims that in april 
1987 on his brokers advice he entered into a series of 
complicated transactions that depended on a stock price rising it 
didnt 
the october 87 market crash left peterson with 800000 in 
losses from speculative trades in sophisticated securities with 
fancy names like naked puts and margin calls now the 
dallas millionaire wants his money back 
peterson has taken his case to arbitration the outofcourt 
forum where wall street firms require customers to resolve disputes 
with brokers 
but like many disgruntled investors whose savings are squandered 
through naivete bad judgment or broker incompetence peterson 
contends he cannot get a fair hearing because the arbitration 
system favors the industry 
my lifes about over but ive got one more battle to fight and 
im going to win it said peterson who claims the case has cost 
him about 2 million in trading losses taxes legal fees and other 
expenses about half his net worth 
arbitration has come under increased scrutiny since the supreme 
court last may upheld the constitutionality of contracts that 
require brokerage customers to settle grievances before a hearing 
panel rather than in court 
opponents claim arbitration is biased because it is run by the 
nations stock exchanges and other selfregulatory bodies and 
because panels contain an industry representative proponents say 
it is quicker and faster than litigation and investors do just as 
well in recovering losses 
the securities and exchange commission last year approved 
reforms designed to remove secrecy surrounding the process and ease 
what advocates of arbitration say is an unfounded image of 
anticustomer bias 
arbitrators are deciding the case not some board of directors 
of a stock exchange said theodore a krebsbach director of 
litigation for the wall street firm shearson lehman hutton inc 
its a perception thing not a reality 
unlike litigation arbitration panels make decisions based on 
information presented without complex rules of evidence 
arbitrators do not have to explain decisions and appeals are 
limited panels usually consist of one securities industry 
representative and two arbitrators representing the public 
the worst thing is having a cadre of retired brokers and 
managers people who depended on the industry for ideas and money 
for years sitting in judgment on people who have been ripped off 
by brokers said robert dyer an orlando fla lawyer who 
handles securities arbitration cases 
because of the key supreme court ruling and the bull market 
followed by huge investor losses in the crash arbitration claims 
have surged a total of 6101 cases was filed in 1988 vs 830 in 
1980 
industry figures show investors won 51 percent of the 3731 
cases decided in 198688 of 102 rulings in a threemonth period 
last year victorious plaintiffs recovered about half of the losses 
they claimed according to a study by securities arbitration 
commentator a maplewood nj newsletter 
but if prearbitration settlements are included industry 
officials estimate about 75 percent of grievances result in some 
monetary award high by legal standards 
while customers such as peterson have resources to fight others 
are not as fortunate a divorced new jersey teacher who lost 
100000 in the crash claimed that trading by her shearson broker 
was irresponsible and unsuitable she sought 35744184 in losses 
and damages she got nothing 
others do well by the process a divorced los angeles mother 
recently won 403000 in a case alleging inappropriate investments 
by her painewebber inc broker in a rare punitive damage award 
arbitrators also ordered the firm to pay her 100000 and the 
broker to pay 50000 
but because arbitration panels do not have to issue written 
opinions it is difficult to determine the basis for decisions 
prior to last may the selfregulatory groups were not even 
required to disclose arbitration awards 
the new york stock exchange and national association of 
securities dealers handle about 90 percent of the nations 
arbitrations with the rest occurring at smaller exchanges 
brokerages own and control the selfregulatory groups 
partly because of the bias perception the securities industry 
conference on arbitration last year required that customer 
contracts highlight arbitration clauses formerly buried in fine 
print exchanges also limited independent arbitrators ties to wall 
street 
but lawyers want more choice in deciding who sits on arbitration 
panels a larger pool of arbitrators to choose from mandatory 
written opinions and the right to substitute an independent 
arbitrator for the industry panelist 
i want someone who is more representative of my client than 
someone who is more representative of the types of people were 
suing said new york lawyer theodore eppenstein who 
unsuccessfully argued the supreme court case involving arbitration 
contracts 
last week the selfregulatory bodies agreed to study a proposal 
by the securities industry association wall streets main trade 
group to remove arbitration from industry auspices to an 
independent forum such as the american arbitration association 
stock exchange officials defend the current system and see no 
need to replace it even though arbitration programs are costly 
for example the nasd said it spent 709 million on arbitration in 
198788 recovering just 134 million in fees 
arbitrations backers say that adding written opinions and 
appeals will make arbitration resemble litigation more expensive 
and drawnout for everyone defeating the purpose lawyers they 
say prefer court because they can make more money 
it probably gets down to economics said edward w morris 
jr the nyses arbitration director legal fees are less in 
arbitration 
exchange officials maintain that industry panelists are tougher 
on their counterparts because they are concerned about preserving 
ethical standards having an expert also helps decipher complex 
cases they say 
the people who serve on these panels do so because they 
feel very strongly about the integrity of the industry said 
scott noah assistant general counsel for the american stock 
exchange 
pete peterson would disagree the investor claims the 
arbitrators hearing his case laughed and talked during testimony by 
one witness hearing transcripts show one panel member told 
peterson he did not like his personality and another asked why he 
was so foolish to trust his broker 
peterson claims the broker embarked on a toorisky strategy and 
ignored repeated instructions to bail out and cut his losses 
bruce collins an attorney for the brokerage rauscher pierce 
refsnes inc said peterson was a savvy investor who agreed to the 
transactions and simply took a beating the firm denies wrongdoing 
collins claimed peterson who has hired a public relations 
firm written protests to the nyse congress and the sec and paid 
for an outside study of his case is challenging the arbitration 
panel because he fears he will lose 
merits aside the peterson case shows that investors unhappy 
with arbitration do not have alternatives some lawyers say the 
lack of choice and flaws in the process subvert investor protection 
intended by depressionera securities laws 
stockbrokers say trust us with your money youre in good 
hands with us said william f davis a los angeles lawyer 
then when you lose it they say thats the breaks

not far from the site where david 
fought goliath archaeologists are peeling the mystery away from a 
vast industrial complex in a network of artificial caves dating 
back at least 2700 years 
maresha the likely birthplace of king herod flourished as a 
commercial center of about 5000 people said archaeologist amos 
kloner unique among the ancient cities mareshites established 
their industry underground they raised pigeons manufactured olive 
oil stabled horses collected rainwater and buried their dead in 
underground chambers chiseled from soft chalk limestone 
kloner who has spent 15 years excavating and mapping the 
network of more than 1000 interlocking chambers said the caves 
were in continuous use from at least the 8th century bc until 40 
bc when maresha was overrun by parthians from ancient armenia 
why they invested so heavily in underground development is still a 
puzzle especially since there are no natural caves in the region 
kloner of the state antiquities authority suggests the reason 
may have been simple practicality 
the caves were apparently created when the ancients quarried 
stones to build a hilltop fortress and surrounding houses he said 
maybe it was easier to use such chambers since the walls and roof 
were already in place 
the lifestyle especially during the pagan hellenistic period 
when maresha reached its peak a few centuries bc is becoming 
clearer 
teams have unearthed a fortress tower ordinary houses 
thousands of pottery vessels figurines a horde of silver coins 
and an almost perfectly preserved olive oil factory as far as 
the hellenistic period is concerned there is no site more 
important kloner said 
particularly important are silver coins the newest of which 
were dated 112 bc and found in a house above one of the cave 
systems kloner said the date confirmed jewish sources about the 
conquest of the city by john hyrcanus i who forced the edomites to 
convert to judaism 
pointing to an inscription found in a series of gabled burial 
chambers kloner translated the greek the bones of beretanu and 
appolonius the sons of antipater a later antipater was the 
father of herod the great and the name in maresha may be further 
proof of herods origins here he said 
most figurines and other remains in the burial chamber were 
looted during the 1970s in addition to the theft problem the 
caves are dangerous and are officially closed to the public the 
hilly terrain is punctured with open pits from collapsed chambers 
some concealed by overgrowth the caves have no lights and in 
recent years three spelunkers have been killed and a dozen injured 
the jewish national fund plans to open the site to the public by 
next year after the government spends about 1 million to make the 
site safe 
the caves in the judean foothills 30 miles southwest of

researchers are jumpy about the practice of 
dissecting frogs in biology class and would like the practice 
excised from curriculums 
out of 365 letters to research and development magazine in 
response to an october editorial 55 percent supported a statement 
that dissection should not be required in high school biology 40 
percent said it should be required and 5 percent were undecided 
said robert cassidy editorinchief 
the results are surprising in that we expected more scientists 
and researchers to favor dissection of frogs in biology classes 
cassidy said the poll wasnt scientific because the comments were 
voluntary he said 
the issue of frog dissection gained national attention in 1987 
after a los angelesarea girl refused to participate citing moral 
beliefs the case led to a 1989 california law allowing students to 
refuse to dissect animals a case also cropped up last year in new 
jersey where a girl cited religious beliefs 
the animal legal defense fund which estimates that 57 million 
animals are killed each year for dissection in colleges and high 
schools also has begun a campaign to inform students about their 
right to refuse to dissect animals 
in the survey scientists who were against dissection wrote that 
students dont really learn anything from the practice that its 
inhumane and that it does not foster a good education cassidy said 
the fact that these people took the time to write is telling 
i mean they took office polls and everything some told of their 
own personal experiences how humiliating it was 
one high school graduate who survived worm grasshopper and frog 
dissections said she doesnt understand what all the fuss is about 
when i did it in high school it wasnt this huge issue like it 
is now said cynthia lu a student at john marshall law school in 
chicago you did it and didnt question it 
i didnt have too many problems with it the frog was already 
dead

its study of information technology in the securities markets the 
panel is slated to meet monday to review a draft report 
published reports in the wall street journal and usa today this 
week have indicated the study in the works for the last 18 months 
is critical of the nyses specialist system of trading in which 
stock can only be traded through certain designated exchange 
members who are charged with maintaining an orderly market in that 
security even if it means buying or selling the stock because no 
other takers can be found 
spokesmen for various organizations in new york and washington

study 
a spokeswoman for the nyse sharon gamsin said the study is not 
complete yet we will comment on the final study study when their

jean mcdonald a spokeswoman for ota an arm of congress that 
analyzes science and technology and its potential impact said the 
study was requested in june 1988 by the house energy and commerce 
committee headed by rep john d dingell dmich 
a spokesman for the committee said he hadnt seen a final copy 
of the draft and couldnt comment on what action if any congress 
might take 
the study was an outgrowth of the 1987 stock market crash

trading 
a draft of the ota study is to be reviewed monday in washington 
by a panel that includes market professionals regulators 
academics bankers and others

board equally divided between democrats and republicans house

as campeau corp gradually lost its footing last 
year a unique group of financial middlemen that helps keep 
department store shelves stocked demonstrated the powerful role it 
plays in retailing 
these middlemen known as factors told several apparel 
manufacturers they wouldnt step in to accept the credit risk of 
allied stores corp and federated department stores inc campeaus 
american retailing arms 
the snub didnt push allied and federated over the brink and 
into bankruptcy court but by raising the prospect of bare shelves 
the move by factors may have nudged the campeau divisions in that 
direction 
without the faith of the factoring and credit community the 
nine allied and federated chains from new yorkbased bloomingdales 
to the bon marche in seattle were in danger of losing face in the 
industry 
factoring companies have significant power in the apparel 
industry which supplies merchandise that accounts for the bulk of 
sales at many department stores their relationship with 
manufacturers is closer than that between traditional credit rating 
agencies or bill collectors and clients 
like credit agencies factors advise clothing makers whether 
its wise to deal with a particular retailer but in addition 
factors assume the credit risk of retailers for manufacturers and 
advance loans to apparel makers as well as performing much of 
their bookkeepping work 
to a certain extent were a special breed said francis x 
basile chairman and chief executive officer of the countrys 
largest factoring company cit groupfactoring inc a subsidiary 
of manufacturers hanover corp and japans daiichi kangyo bank ltd 
factoring is a long established but little understood 
occupation the practice probably goes back to antiquity but its 
modern evolution in this country began in colonial times when 
agents known as factors were hired to service mills in england 
and europe 
it started as a service at the wholesale end of the distribution 
chain involving fabrics sold by textile mills to manufacturers 
and evolved to include goods sold by manufacturers to retailers 
a factor buys a manufacturers accounts receivables and assumes 
the risks that those bills will be paid if a retailer doesnt come 
through with the money for an order of womens dresses for 
instance a factor still has to pay its client the dress maker 
the factoring fee averages about 1 percent of the volume of the 
receivables 
factors play a key role in the garment trade because the 
industry is dominated by small to mediumsized companies that cant 
afford to assume credit risks themselves 
because theyre putting their money on the line factors dont 
want their clients to accept orders from shaky retailers but 
factors cant be too conservative their clients need to sell and 
could find others more eager for their business 
basile said he tells his staff be liberal but dont get 
stuck 
factors also will allow clients to draw advances against the 
receivables giving them cash to manufacture pending orders 
factors charge interest on advances outstanding 
the wellrun the intelligent factor is going to tailormake 
an arrangement for its clients or potential clients basile said 
the uniqueness of what we do allows us some latitude in 
structuring deals and helping clients 
factoring companies also perform all the bookkeeping tasks for 
some of their clients essentially becoming a clients credit 
department 
factoring has had an image problem and some outsiders confuse 
them with lenders who charge excessive interest 
basile who has been in factoring and commercial finance for 
more than 30 years said when he was new to the business he was 
told that companies that used factors were a step away from 
bankruptcy a notion he rejects 
the fact of the matter is we have among our clients 
companies that are the rock of gibralter financially he said 
still some companies prefer not to disclose that they use 
factors making it impossible to gauge how much merchandise in 
stores is factored industry estimates range as high as 70 percent 
the volume of receivables factored in the apparel industry was 
nearly 45 billion in 1988 according to figures compiled by the 
textile and apparel trade publication daily news record 
although largely confined to the textile and apparel trades 
factors are active in footwear and home furnishings the trust 
company bank in atlanta also handles factoring in seafood and 
trucking 
we have tried to spread our tentacles theres no reason why 
many businesses cant be factored basile said i think that we 
have trouble getting into certain businesses because we have an 
undeserved reputation 
factors once were small independent outfits until banks started 
acquiring them basile said a factor doing 25 billion in annual 
volume was a giant in 1980 cits volume last year was about 75 
billion 
some banks in recent years have withdrawn from factoring and 
sold out to others in the past 10 years the number of factors has 
been halved with about 15 to 18 left

some suppliers for campeau corps us 
department stores say theyve resumed shipping merchandise despite 
being unable to cash checks the retailers issued shortly before 
seeking bankruptcy court protection 
analysts had called the resumption of normal shipments the most 
pressing issue for the stores under chapter 11 protection 
especially for stores in the south where the spring selling season 
opens soon 
right now were not asking anything from them except to honor 
the normal conditions of business said david pergola senior 
vice president for sales at the greif cos which began shipping 
clothing thursday to campeaus stores 
we are confident that by the weekend fresh spring merchandise 
will be going out to all of campeaus stores said bernard chaus 
whose bernard chaus inc sold the stores 40 million in clothing 
last year 
chaus said his company hadnt been able to cash some checks 
federated issued before monday because the bankruptcy court had 
frozen the retailers bank account 
many suppliers however said they want to see a courtapproved 
financial plan expected this week from federated department stores 
inc and allied stores corp before shipping goods 
i am planning and hoping to ship to them im waiting to hear 
some more news said howard bloom president of chetta b a new 
york clothing maker id hate to ship now and not get paid id 
look like a fool 
meanwhile thursday campeau spokeswoman carol sanger said the 
company doesnt plan to sell assets to satisfy the debts of 
federated or allied 
the company has no intent to conduct a fire sale she said 
we are not talking about a liquidation we are talking about 
restructuring a corporation 
federated and allied which own such department store chains as 
bloomingdales lazarus and richs filed for protection from their 
creditors monday under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy act 
the chains with 258 stores and 100000 employees in 43 states 
listed debts of 77 billion and assets of 91 billion 
department stores risk losing customers if they cant offer 
fresh merchandise or if their shelves begin to show gaps from lack 
of inventory 
the question is are all vendors going to go along with that 
be comfortable doing that and that is a hard call jack seibald 
a retail analyst for salomon bros in new york said of the 
prospect for renewed shipments my guess is the bigger ones will 
go ahead 
parfums stern inc a cosmetics maker movado watch corp and 
lenox china said they havent decided when to resume shipments 
fred kalmar vice president for finance at bugle boy industries 
said the clothing company has been promised a report on campeaus 
financing this week 
we do plan to support the campeau stores kalmar said 
liz claiborne spokeswoman sarah patterson said the company has 
clothing shipments prepared but is waiting for a financial plan 
campeau promised to provide by friday 
liz claiborne tops the lists of unsecured creditors for many of 
the federated and allied stores with the bankruptcy filing listing 
millions of dollars in debts ms patterson said the company didnt 
know how much the stores owe 
leslie fay a sportswear maker began shipping orders to 
campeaus stores thursday said senior vice president herman 
gordon he estimated the stores outstanding account with leslie 
fay at a couple of million dollars but said he was confident 
of repayment 
we are going to be shipping to them on the regular terms we 
have always dealt with gordon said

the chapter 11 filing by campeau corps 
retailing divisions could cost some former top executives 
retirement benefits totaling as much as 10 million 
about 525 former executives of federated department stores inc 
and allied stores corp are in that group they account for less 
than 2 percent of federateds 25000 retirees nationwide but their 
claims are the largest and the least likely to be fully paid 
were talking about executives with six or sevenfigure 
incomes not widows and orphans campeau spokeswoman carol sanger 
said 
campeau the real estate company owned by canadian robert 
campeau that acquired allied in 1986 and federated in 1988 put its 
us retail operations under bankruptcy protection monday as a way 
to keep the 258 affected department stores operating 
the stores are profitable but campeau owes about 77 billion 
largely because of the high cost of financing the acquisitions 
it seems somehow wrong that people who worked hard for many 
years are now victims of mr campeaus takeover said james 
selonick a former federated vice president our money which is 
a good many million dollars is being used to bail out federated 
and i think thats unreasonable 
selonick and other former executives are listed among 
federateds creditors in 6000 pages of bankruptcy documents the 
company filed 
most of those losing their pensions will be senior executives 
who took part in senior employee retirement plans and deferred 
compensation plans or who had signed individual employment 
agreements 
others are executives who worked for federated before 1953 when 
its current pension plans were established the former employees 
pre1953 benefits are not protected from the bankruptcy 
all other pensions life insurance and medical benefits paid by 
federated are protected under bankruptcy proceedings ms sanger 
said 
the bankruptcy filings listed 25 federated executives who will 
lose an undetermined amount of benefits from individual employment 
agreements they had signed retirees who signed such agreements 
typically earned 100000 to 1 million a year 
those things are not protected in a trust because they were 
individually negotiated and the payments stop in a chapter 11

the nations former top thrift regulator joined 
with his subordinates in a vendetta against lincoln savings and 
loan association the former holding company for the thrift alleges 
in a us district court filing 
attorneys for phoenixbased american continental corp on 
thursday asked judge richard m bilby to add edwin gray former 
chairman of the federal home loan bank board as a defendant in the 
holding companys suit against current and former sampl regulators 
the case is scheduled to go to trial march 27 in tucson 
gray currently an officer of chase federal savings bank in 
miami could not be reached for comment telephones went unanswered 
at the bank and his home 
american continental sued last spring claiming that regulators 
had undercut its efforts to save lincoln a 6 billion thrift 
headquartered in irvine calif 
the filing came after american continental filed for 
reorganization under federal bankruptcy laws on april 13 and the 
government seized lincoln the holding companys chief asset on 
april 14 the government bailout is expected to cost at least 2 
billion in taxpayer money 
american continental also is suing in a federal court in 
washington to overturn the governments seizure of lincoln 
investors meanwhile are suing lincoln in us bankruptcy court 
in phoenix alleging the loss of 250 million on junk bonds 
purchased through the thrift 
american continental spokesman bradley boland said the companys 
motion to include gray as a defendant alleges that gray and others 
engaged in a pattern of leaking confidential inaccurate and 
misleading information to the press 
the pattern was systematic and done in retaliation for american 
continentals criticism of reregulation of the sampl industry which 
gray was promoting boland said in a news release 
the release of information sullied the reputations of lincoln 
and american continental and damaged their business relationships 
he said 
michael gallagher an attorney for american continental said 
the decision to include gray as a defendant was based partially on 
testimony by rosemary stewart a regulator for the treasury 
departments office of thrift supervision before the house banking 
committee last year 
ms stewart who worked for the nowdefunct fhlbb under gray 
said she sensed a hidden agenda on the part of certain agency 
officials with regard to lincoln

anything about petroleum

french chemical giant rhonepoulenc sa has 
agreed to merge its pharmaceutical business with rorer group inc 
in the latest drug industry deal that seeks to lower research costs 
and gain global market reach 
the two companies announced thursday that rhonepoulenc would 
contribute nearly all of its worldwide pharmaceutical operations to 
rorer in exchange for 68 percent of the new companys stock the 
remaining stock would be offered to shareholders in rorer which is 
best known for its maalox antacid 
analysts estimated the deal would be worth about 3 billion 
the new company would be one of the worlds 10 biggest 
pharmaceutical companies in terms of sales and rank no 2 in 
europe the companies said 
rorer will promote our aggressive entry into the two top world 
markets the us and japan said jeanrene fourtou 
rhonepoulencs chairman and chief executive second it moves us 
into the top 10 pharmaceutical companies and offers us the 
crtitical mass to achieve our longterm expansion plans 
rorer emphasized the companies still need to arrange financing 
and the proposed merger needs to win approval from their directors 
and stockholders 
about 75 percent of rhonepoulenc is owned by the french 
government according to rorer spokesman jeff richardson 
samuel isaly a partner in mehta and isaly a stock market 
research firm described the proposed deal as an excellent 
strategic combination 
rhonepoulenc is in the top 10 in the european pharmaceutical 
market but has no direct marketing in the united states or japan 
where rorer has a modest network established 
so in a single stroke a new pharmaceutical specialty firm is 
created with reasonably strong positions in the us europe and 
japan isaly said 
the analyst said however that the firms products are not as 
complementary as their geographic markets 
rorers major drugs are cardiovascular gastroenterology 
hypersensitivity bone metabolism and plasma products 
rhonepoulenc concentrates on cardiovascular antibiotic 
antiinflammatory central nervous system and oncology drugs 
rhonepoulenc would have a majority of the seats on the new 
companys board of directors but robert e cawthorn rorers 
chairman and chief executuve would head the new company 
rorer stockholders would get a mix of cash and securities worth 
about 73 a share according to a statement from rorer 
rorer stock closed down 75 cents a share thursday at 6287 in 
new york stock exchange trading the deal was announced after the 
market closed thursday 
the announcement was expected on monday rorer said it was 
negotiating with an unidentifed firm that would acquire 68 percent 
of its stock 
the securities and exchange commission on wednesday filed suit 
in us district court in new york charging three unidentified 
foreign firms and a swiss investor with trading on rorer stock 
based on inside information about the negotiations 
rhonepoulenc based in paris had an estimated 11 billion in 
1989 sales while rorer based in the philadelphia suburb of fort 
washington had sales of more than 11 billion 
as the cost of developing new drugs climbs the pharmaceutical 
industry has been undergoing a rash of mergers with companies 
seeking to gain higher revenues from worldwide markets while 
cutting research and development costs through consolidation 
last year philadelphiabased smithkline beckman corp merged 
with britains beecham group plc to form smithkline beecham and 
new yorkbased brisol myers co acquired squibb corp of 
princeton nj to form bristolmyers squibb co 
rorer officials compared the proposed deal with the merger that 
created marion merrell dow last year dow chemical co bought a 
controlling interest in marion labs inc a kansas city mo 
pharmaceutical company and combined the company with its 
pharmaceutical subsidiary merrell dow a minority interest remains 
in public hands keeping a stock exchange quote for marion merrell 
dow

the cost of sales incentives and temporary plant 
closings will cut into automakers profits for the fourth quarter 
of 1989 and into this year analysts predict 
seven automotive analysts checked by the associated press 
forecast dramatic profit drops among the nations big three 
automakers in the fourth quarter 
chrysler corp will earn little or nothing they said thursday 
fourthquarter and yearend 1989 earnings statements for general 
motors corp ford motor co and chrysler are due within the next 
four weeks and will show a significant drop from the record 1121 
billion in earnings the companies reported for 1988 
gms fourthquarter 1989 earnings should be between 48 percent 
and 58 percent lower than the year before the analysts said 
fords are forecast to be between 40 percent and 44 percent lower 
and chryslers profits are predicted to be nearly nonexistent 
chrysler could be marginally profitable in the regular 
automotive earnings said independent analyst david healy of new 
york but they have a bunch of writeoffs possible which 
could leave the fourthquarter in the red 
healy and other analysts said the no 3 automakers early 
retirement and salaried employee severance plans hooked to its 15 
billion costreduction program will cut into earnings 
gm is likely to report a onetime gain on the sale of some of 
its stock in isuzu motors ltd of japan boosting its nonoperating 
income the analysts said 
overall production cuts and the cost of buyer incentives to 
sell cars and trucks will depress earnings in the quarter they 
said 
i think that the combination of higher incentives and lower 
production has basically reduced the industry to the breakeven 
level healy said 
in past quarters gm and ford have reported profits buoyed by 
earnings overseas especially in europe chrysler has little 
presence outside north america 
the trend of overseas profits outpacing north american earnings 
is likely to continue the analysts said 
i dont think anybody is going to make money in north 
america said kathleen heaney of nikko securities co 
international inc of new york 
in addition to incentive and lostproduction costs big three 
earnings have been dented by increasing popularity of cars made by 
japanese companies in the united states and overseas 
last year for example the honda accord was the bestselling 
car in the united states nearly 60 percent of those cars were made 
at hondas plant in marysville ohio and the rest were imported 
the automotive recession in north america is much deeper than 
it looks said scott merlis of morgan stanley amp co in new york 
it has been artificially levitated by rebates 
automakers are reluctant to talk about the cost of rebates but 
acknowledge that it can average in the hundreds of dollars for 
every vehicle sold some dealers have complained that new cars are 
priced artificially high to make up for the incentives 
the companies sometimes charge incentive costs to the quarter in 
which the vehicle was built and sometimes to the quarter in which 
it was sold that makes it tough to tell just how much a company is 
spending on the consumer lures 
but no matter when automakers account for the incentives they 
come straight from profits

while many fellow economists are contemplating a 
soft landing if not a recession for the economy in 1990 russell 
redenbaugh an experienced forecaster is preparing for a soft 
takeoff 
a soft takeoff is a safe one although perhaps undramatic it is 
not a sudden ascent its characteristics are moderation 
sustainability steadiness it is a positive reassuring economy 
in more specific economic terms it means growth of between 2 
percent and 3 percent accompanied by moderation of the extremes 
and negatives that marred the 1980s 
it means lower inflation lower interest rates a lower federal 
budget deficit it means more exports and a reduction in the trade 
imbalance it is one accompanied by lower capital gains taxes and 
rising returns on capital 
it is an economic situation that redenbaugh says professional 
economists with a negative outlook have grossly misread 
because they have misread events he says they have come to 
patently wrong conclusions 
that is they are talking about economic deterioration obsessed 
with a handful of gloomy statistics for specific sectors of the 
us economy unable to measure an historic event that he calls 
the key indicator 
to him the key to the immediate economic future is the freeing 
of the eastern european economies from 40 years of 
deindustrialization a discontinuity that the economics 
profession cannot comprehend 
redenbaugh knows that his forecast puts him way out on a limb 
especially in the conservative business in which he operates but 
he claims to like it there saying i feel comfortable its never 
crowded 
most economists and investment advisers run in a herd he says 
adding in this business you must have an aversion to crowds 
crowds are comfortable but they never produce good results 
redenbaugh needs results is measured by them and expects to 
get them as chief strategist for cooke amp bieler inc a 
philadelphiabased asset management firm for fortune 500 pension 
funds and profitsharing accounts 
he believes that recent economic events will produce a real 
peace dividend an immediate expansion of commerce and a 
lengthening investment horizon that as a consequence will means 
higher priceearnings ratios for stocks 
he isnt entirely alone in his optimism edward yardeni of 
prudentialbache is probably as far out on a limb and the 
conference board said today that the us economy is rebounding 
rather than eroding with exports leading the way 
but if you attended a convention of economists almost anywhere 
this month you might not be pleased with what you heard based on 
their published reports almost any uplifting news would be 
balanced off with depressing reminders 
redenbaugh believes many professional economists are unable to 
deal with changes in europe because it doesnt fit their 
orthodoxy of using statistical models to explain everything 
he contends they want to say something to the effect that 
three out of the last four times when the iron curtain collapsed 
the following happened which is of course absurd 
while the suddenness of the collapse of managed economies in 
europe amazed redenbaugh he had suggested it might happen 
although more slowly in a paper one year ago 
at that time he said economic considerations were dismantling 
the iron curtain and undermining communist ideology and that if 
the soviet union was to survive it would have to abandon marxist 
economic systems 
what has since occurred he says is now the key factor in 
economic forecasting whether or not it fits the conventional 
forecasting models 
as the 1990s begin he states it is not the health of the 
economy that is questionable for it is healthy it is the health 
of the economics profession that is questionable

a consumer group is asking federal regulators 
to make sure this weeks major outage in atampt long distance service 
wasnt the result of profit motives getting in the way of quality 
the consumer federation of america said thursday it would ask 
the federal communications commission today to investigate what 
happened on monday why the outage lasted for nine hours and why 
atampt wasnt better prepared to handle it 
gene kimmelman the federations legislative director said he 
was concerned that atampt may be cutting corners under new fcc 
regulations that let the company earn whatever profits it can 
within a price cap formula that limits yearly price increases 
in moving to this new form of relaxed regulation with no limit 
on profits atampt may have reconfigured its network cutting corners 
on quality to try to boost its profits kimmelman said 
an american telephone and telegraph co spokesman labeled 
kimmelmans allegations utterly ridiculous 
the federations announcement came shortly after atampt said it 
will give its customers nine hours of discount calling on feb 14 
valentines day if the fcc approves 
atampt said it was trying to make amends for mondays ninehour 
outage in which millions of customers got busy signals and failed 
connections when they tried to use atampt long distance service the 
company blamed a computer software problem that spread from new 
york to more than 100 switching centers nationwide 
atampt which has about 80 million customers also said it would 
compensate its 800 service businesses and negotiate oneonone 
with all its business customers for possible additional concessions 
but the consumer group complained that atampt was offering its 
discounts averaging 33 percent on valentines day between 8 
am and 5 pm that mainly would benefit business the federation 
said claiming that most residential customers do their long 
distance calling during evening and nighttime hours 
in a letter being delivered today kimmelman asked the fcc to 
investigate the outage or review the monitoring standards that were 
adopted when price caps went into effect in july 
we find it difficult to understand how the network breakdown 
whatever its initial cause could have spread so far and resulted 
in so much of atampts service being disrupted for so long 
kimmelman wrote 
atampt spokesman herb linnen said the consumer groups claims were 
ridiculous and noted his companys longstanding commitment to 
quality service over more than a century 
he disputed kimmelmans statement that residential customers 
make most long distance calls in the evenings and at night 
the bulk of all long distance calls are made by residential 
customers regardless of time of day and therefore lower 
daytime prices benefit both residential and business customers 
linnen said 
atampt chairman robert e allen said his company was offering the 
valentines day discounts as a gesture to underscore how much we 
value our relationship with our customers knowing there is no way 
to make up for the inconvenience they may have experienced 
if the fcc approves atampts request the companys residential 
business and international customers would be charged an average 33 
percent less than regular weekday charges on outofstate 
directdialed calls placed during the day 
atampt which carries 70 percent of the nations longdistance 
calls said a 10minute directdialed coasttocoast call between 
8 am and 5 pm on valentines day would cost 158 compared 
with 250 on a normal weekday 
the discounts also will apply to credit card calls and 800 
service calls but not to operatorassisted calls or to calls 
placed before 8 am or after 5 pm which already are discounted 
linnen said 
the company said 800 service customers will be eligible to 
receive a credit on their bills up to the monthly service charge

the no 1 export growth market for american 
farmers over the next few years wont be the soviet union china or 
even japan says the agriculture department it will be taiwan 
a new study by the departments foreign agricultural service 
puts taiwan at top of a 10nation listing of prime opportunities 
for us agricultural exports 
the others in order are south korea japan hong kong egypt 
pakistan iraq singapore the soviet union and turkey china was a 
nearmiss coming in 11th 
mike dwyer of the departments foreign agricultural service said 
a number of variable factors were considered in a computer model 
used to analyze 80 countries as us agricultural customers and 
project growths over the next three to five years 
some of the factors were related to trade performance including 
growth in imports from the united states going back to 1980 other 
macroeconomic variables such as debtandservice ratios 
population trends and per capita incomes were considered 
dwyer reporting in a forthcoming issue of agexporter magazine 
noted of the 10 top potential markets nine are developing 
countries with japan the exception 
also he said most of the others are in the middle east and the 
far east with an emphasis on newly industrialized countries of 
asia taiwan south korea and hong kong 
looking at us agricultural exports in the 198688 period 
dwyer said taiwan was the sixth largest market importing an 
average of 136 billion worth of products annually south korea 
was third at 18 billion while japan was the biggest at 61 
billion 
while these are all quite large our study suggests there is a 
lot of room for further growth he said 
the 12nation european economic community as a bloc is one of 
the biggest markets for american farmers for example in the 1989 
fiscal year that ended last sept 30 when us farm exports 
totaled 397 billion the eec accounted for 65 billion topped 
only by japan at 82 billion 
but dwyer said the eec didnt show great growth potential in the 
study 
despite the weaker dollar eec nations have been declining 
markets for the united states in recent years he said it will 
probably become more difficult to export bulk commodities there 
because the region already has become or is becoming 
selfsufficient in many of these products 
some of the bestgrowth markets including iraq egypt and 
pakistan show up well because of projected population growth us 
food aid credit and subsidized prices dwyer said 
in the ninthranked soviet union growth potential based purely 
on numbers is very good over the next few years he said 
add to that the changes taking place in the political 
environment there and that market could really expand for the 
united states dwyer said the agricultural sector is unable to 
keep pace with demand and consumers are dissatisfied with the lack 
of food on grocery shelves 
dwyer added the kremlin is aware of the problems and is 
interested in restructuring the soviet food system the move toward 
freemarket practices could create opportunities for diversities 
in soviet imports 
china with more than one billion people and its political 
turmoil is difficult to gauge but stacks up as a favorable growth 
market for the united states he said 
prior to 1981 china was a hot import market dwyer said 
then the realization hit that it couldnt continue to import at 
the rate it was without incurring massive foreign debt so china 
pulled back and imports fell 13 percent a year during 198187 
as a result chinas imports of us products dropped an average 
of 28 percent a year during the 198088 period he said 
there has a been a comeback in us exports to china this 
past year but the market is considered volatile dwyer said

cigna corp has signed a definitive 
agreement to acquire equicorequitable hca corp in a 777 million 
deal that would make cigna the nations largest health insurer for 
employers 
cigna on thursday said it would purchase the nashvillebased 
company which sells health insurance in a cash transaction 
once the deal is completed cigna would serve more than 12 
million people with traditional health insurance operations and 
nearly 2 million more through health maintenance organizations 
equicor is a joint venture owned by the equitable life assurance 
society of the united states and hospital corporation of america 
it is the sixthlargest group health insurer based on 55 billion 
in premiums and fees for administering employers own health 
insurance plans in 1988 
wilson h taylor cigna chairman and chief executive officer 
said the aquisition would result in the elimination of some jobs 
because of duplication of effort but the company hasnt determined 
yet how many or which jobs would be lost 
taylor said cigna is buying equicor because cigna is committed 
to establishing a leading position in the managed health care 
business 
managed care refers to health maintenance organizations and 
other networks of health care providers aimed at restraining the 
soaring costs of care 
the timing for growth couldnt be any better because of 
employers increasing desire to limit rising costs of employee 
health care he said 
analysts said the plan was a good one for cigna 
i think it is a brilliant strategic move because size and 
critical mass have become the key strategic variable in the group 
health business said g alan zimmerman a vice president at 
smith barney harris upham amp co you have to get bigger in order 
to negotiate effectively with employers 
cigna already has the largest forprofit chain of hmos in the 
nation bringing in 15 billion of revenues in 1988 compared with 
equicors 300 million in revenue 
the acquisition will increase cignas hmo membership by about 30 
percent cigna has 15 million hmo members in 31 sites across the 
nation and equicor has 450000 in 19 sites 
cigna has yet to report financial results for 1989 but taylor 
said its hmo operations lost money they are expected to post a 
profit this year he said 
equicors hmo operaton with some hmos relatively new are 
incurring modest losses overall taylor said 
equicor has 7300 employees in about 80 offices nationwide 
the acquisition which is subject to regulatory approval should 
be completed in six months officials said

britains inflation rate rose 03 percent in 
december and was up 77 percent for the year the government said 
friday 
the central statistical office attributed the december rise in 
the retail price index to sharp increases in food prices 
particularly for fresh fruit and vegetables the index also 
reflected higher housing costs the government said 
the rate was better than the 78 percent increase the financial 
markets had been expecting and was good news for the government 
which has been fighting resurgent inflation with 15 percent 
interest rates 
the index which uses a january 1987 base of 100 stood at 1188 
in december compared with 1185 in november and 1103 in december 
1988 
excluding mortgage interest payments retail prices rose 61 
percent in december from the previous year this is the same rate 
of increase as novembers and octobers yearoveryear rises

on karsten mahlmanns calendar the new year 
began jan 1 but it took a little longer for the chicago board of 
trade chairman to put 1989 behind him 
not until this past wednesday when he won a close election to a 
fourth consecutive oneyear term was mahlmann certain of majority 
support among the 3500 members of the worlds oldest and largest 
commodity futures exchange 
it was a vote of confidence after a year of scandal that began 
jan 19 1989 when federal authorities revealed a sweeping 
investigation of trading fraud at the board of the trade and the 
smaller chicago mercantile exchange which together account for 
about 75 percent of us futures trading volume 
i cant remember a tougher year in the seven years ive served 
on the board mahlmann said in an interview 
the probe has resulted in criminal charges against 48 people 
fourteen have pleaded guilty to swindling customers 
a parallel investigation at new yorks four major futures 
exchanges was revealed in may but has yielded no indictments yet 
the board of trades troubles multiplied in july when exchange 
directors exercised their seldomused authority to order traders to 
sell soybean futures forcing prices lower the board claimed it 
was necessary to prevent one grain company from cornering the 
market 
the tradingfraud scandal brought cries for reform of the 
rapidly growing futures industry and has delayed congressional 
reauthorization of the commodity futures trading commission the 
federal agency that regulates the futures pits futures contracts 
are agreements to buy or sell commodities ranging from agricultural 
products to financial instruments on some future date at a price 
agreed upon in advance people trade futures to hedge losses or 
speculate on future prices 
amid the intense public scrutiny of the futures markets and 
their trading practices in the past year the chicago exchanges 
have strengthened policing efforts stiffened penalties for 
cheating and proposed reforms that address some concerns raised by 
the fbi investigation 
but the toughest measures such as restrictions on dual trading 
and stricter regulation of broker associations are yet to come 
dual trading is the practice among floor brokers of trading for 
their own accounts as well as customer accounts broker 
associations are groups of independent futures traders who share 
revenues and pool expenses 
critics say both practices provide opportunities for traders to 
defraud customers 
a lot needs to be done said rep glenn english dokla 
if you review whats actually been done weve had a good deal 
more in terms of intentions expressed rather than real action 
english sponsored a cftc reauthorization bill passed last year 
by the house the measure would sharply curtail dual trading until 
an exchange demonstrates an ability to better detect wrongdoing 
senate action on a similar bill is pending 
the cftc meanwhile is seeking public comment on a proposed 
rule that would limit dual trading but its not as tough as the 
bills in congress 
the chicago exchanges defend dual trading as a means of keeping 
markets liquid when the customer order flow is light thus reducing 
price volatility they bristled when curbs on dual trading were 
first suggested but have since indicated acceptance of 
restrictions that would be lifted when highly accurate 
tradeauditing systems are in place 
the board of trade and merc are involved in a rare joint effort 
to develop a handheld electronic traderecording device the 
machine would replace the traditional paper cards on which 
commodity traders pencil in their trades 
the electronic trading cards and would zap the information to 
exchange computers theoretically creating a complete 
instantaneous record of all trades 
the exchanges have invited proposals for companies to design an 
electronic trading card and hope to begin testing prototypes on 
their trading floors this fall 
it will make detection of abuses a certainty said merc 
spokesman andrew yemma 
but some critics contend commodities fraud will remain difficult 
to detect until the exchanges do away with openoutcry trading a 
140yearold tradition in which traders crowd pits and strike deals 
through a seemingly chaotic combination of hand signals and shouted 
bids and offers 
verbal orders executed by shakes winks hand gestures spit 
and godknows what thats the window of opportunity for fraud 
said former sen thomas eagleton who quit the chicago mercs board 
of governors in november he accused the exchange of trying to 
protect a former chairman accused of failing to stop two of his 
employees from defrauding investors 
the board of trade and the merc are working on electronic 
trading systems to supplement openoutcry trading but neither 
exchange plans to phase out the practice saying it creates the 
worlds most efficient markets 
the futures industry has enjoyed remarkable growth since the 
early 1970s when financial futures were introduced volume has 
soared from 138 million contracts traded in 1970 to 2674 million 
last year 
last years industrywide volume increase of 88 percent marked 
the 21st consecutive annual rise 
the board of trades trading volume fell 33 percent last year 
though exchange officials blamed it on quieter agricultural 
markets than in 1988 a drought year 
but john damgard president of the futures industry association 
trade group said industrywide volume probably would have been 
higher if it werent for the fraud scandal 
theres clearly been a price to pay for this he said and 
the chicago exchanges are right at the focal point

the bankruptcy filing of campeau corps us 
department store divisions last week came as no surprise to the 
bond market and few small investors should be hurt by the damage 
done to the campeau divisions bonds 
not many individual investors are believed to own bonds issued 
by federated department stores inc and allied stores corp except 
indirectly through mutual funds 
most of it was sophisticated investors big investors said 
pam stubing an analyst for moodys investors service inc 
even investors in junkbond mutual funds that hold allied and 
federated bonds should not see the value of these funds hurt by the 
chapter 11 filing of the department stores thats because the 
funds typically have less than 1 percent of their assets in any 
single bond issue 
for example far less than 1 percent of t rowe prices 
highincome or junkbond fund consists of bonds from allied and 
federated said jane nelson a spokeswoman for the big 
baltimorebased mutual fund operator 
neither price nor fidelity investments another major mutual 
fund sponsor reported much concern from investors in their 
junkbond funds over the bankruptcy filing 
people sort of knew what was going to happen its not as 
though it was a surprise out of the blue said tracy gordon a 
spokeswoman for bostonbased fidelity 
the impact of the filing was muted further by the fact that 
these bonds have been trading far below their issue price for 
months due to concern over campeaus troubled finances 
in fact many of the bonds have been trading at onetenth of the 
price they sold for originally because of that and the assumption 
by many that a bankruptcy reorganization was a foregone conclusion 
the price of the bonds was little affected by the actual filing 
however the bonds began trading on a flat basis after the 
filing when bonds trade flat a seller does not receive any of the 
accumulated interest from the buyer 
bonds typically pay interest only twice a year because of this 
if a bond is purchased for example three months after its last 
interest payment the purchaser would have to pay the seller 
prorated interest 
when a bond trades flat it indicates investors dont expect to 
see any interest payments 
it appears the biggest losers from the allied and federated 
filings could be the institutional investors and investment houses 
that bought large blocks of the bonds 
among the major creditors listed in the bankruptcy papers were 
first boston corp state street bank manufacturers hanover bank 
and painewebber inc 
the par or face value of allieds publicly traded debt 
securities totals about 12 billion while the figure for 
federated is about 2 billion said ms stubing the moodys 
analyst however the actual worth of these issues is far less 
because they are trading below their issue price 
ms stubing said she believes the allied and federated 
bondholders will see some return for their investment despite the 
fact the divisions are nearly 8 billion in debt 
im reasonably optimistic that they will get something for 
their pain and effort she said after all the stores are not 
to blame in this thing the debt is to blame 
but things wont be smooth during the reorganization which 
could take more than a year she said 
its going to be a very complex thing therere a lot of 
entities involved and a lot of crossownership between allied and 
federated

three men have been accused of breaking 
into a government computer and obtaining a classified military 
secret an act a federal prosecutor says shows the nations defense 
computers are vulnerable 
the three silicon valley computer workers kevin l poulsen 24 
mark k lottor 25 and robert e gilligan 31 are accused of 
using personal computers stolen pacific bell telephone co 
equipment and stolen access codes to tap into government and 
telephone computer computers and obtain classified military 
documents and fbi information on associates of the late philippine 
president ferdinand marcos 
peter g neumann a computer security expert at sri 
international a computer consulting company said this was the 
first case he knew of in which classified information was allegedly 
obtained by computer breakins 
the federal indictment unsealed wednesday in us district 
court in san jose is one of the first in the nation to use federal 
criminal statutes directed at computer crime assistant us 
attorney robert k crowe said on thursday 
us attorney joseph russoniello said at a news conference in 
san francisco thursday that the military secret which concerned a 
military exercise at fort bragg nc was classified at the time 
it was stolen in 1987 or 1988 but has since been declassified 
the act does signal a vulnerability in the defense system 
computers he said 
all three men are current or former employees of sun 
microsystems in mountain view or of sri international in menlo park 
according to the indictment poulsen used common burglary tools 
including surgical gloves powdered graphite and lock picks and 
forged a pacific bell employee card to steal the telecommunications 
equipment and access codes from offices in san francisco and san 
ramon in contra costa county 
poulsen and lottor ran part of the alleged conspiracy from the 
menlo park apartment they once shared crowe said 
gilligan and poulsen are accused of trafficking in codes that 
allow access to us government computers through electronic mail 
the 15page indictment said 
the charges said the computer entered by two of the men was the 
army masnet computer network used exclusively by the government 
the charges do not indicate the uses of the computer 
poulsen also is charged with burglarizing pacific bell sites to 
steal the access codes and with manufacturing fake identification 
badges to gain private computer information 
the indictment also accuses poulsen of using his computer 
knowledge to obstruct the investigation into his alleged activities 
gilligan who reportedly still works for sun and lottor who 
works for sri are expected to surrender voluntarily poulsen a 
former employee of both companies remained at large 
if convicted lottor and gilligan face up to 20 years in prison 
and fines of 30000 poulsen could be sentenced to 37 years in 
prison and a 50000 fine 
the indictment does not indicate when authorities began 
investigating the three or what the men intended to do with the 
military secrets

wheat futures prices fell moderately in early

winter storm dumped snow and rain across a large portion of the 
southern plains where moisture was badly needed for the winter 
wheat crop 
the storm system responsible for the moisture was moving from 
the southwest into the central united states today and should help 
replenish soil moisture in corn and soybean areas analysts said 
in early trading wheat futures were 1 cent to 2 cents lower 
with the contract for delivery in march at 395 a bushel corn 
was cent to 1 cent lower with march at 241 a bushel oats were

less than two months after settling a strike 
triggered in part by mandatory overtime for production workers 
boeing co said it expects to cut its seattlearea work force by as 
many as 5000 people 
the aerospace giant said it needed to shed workers because it 
had completed startup work on its newest generation jumbo jet and 
because warmer eastwest ties had cast doubt on the outlook for its 
defense business 
boeing said it hoped to achieve half the cuts through 
retirements and resignations but company officials hinted that 
further layoffs could be possible 
about 1700 hourly workers are to be laid off through april with 
another 800 later in the year the company said thursday 
the martin marietta astronautics group also announced plans 
thursday to cut about 200 jobs by the end of february but will 
transfer many workers to other posts within the aerospace giant a 
company spokeswoman said in denver 
the job losses come as boeing enjoys a record backlog of more 
than 1700 commercial jets worth about 85 billion with deliveries 
scheduled beyond the turn of the century 
last year the company added 10000 employees in the puget sound 
area and was so strapped for production workers it borrowed 600 
machinists from lockheed the company also required workers to put 
in heavy overtime schedules which became a major factor in the 
48day strike by machinists that ended in november 
the lockheed workers were needed on the new 747400 jumbo jet 
which fell behind schedule as the company introduced four different 
versions of the longrange jetliner in 1989 
the extra workers are no longer needed because startup and 
certification work on the new jumbo has been completed boeing said 
about 1400 hourly employees are expected to be laid off at the 
companys everett plant north of seattle where widebody 747s and 
767s are built most of the other layoffs are expected to be at 
defense plants boeing spokesman paul binder said 
in interviews last month boeing chairman frank shrontz said the 
company anticipated some layoffs 
boeing recently announced it wants to build a new widebody jet 
the 777 but no orders have been announced and production startup 
is at least two years away 
because the new 777 airplane program is still not formally 
approved and with uncertainties in the defense budget boeing will 
continue to review and revise its work force requirements 
throughout the year the company said 
binder said boeing thought last fall it could absorb most of the 
commercial airplane job reductions by transferring people into 
defense programs 
but with the opening of the berlin wall and the fall of 
communist regimes in eastern europe late in the year many us 
defense programs have come under question 
some are going to be stretched some cut some shortened 
binder said the requirements of the defense sector just went 
away 
boeing is a major subcontractor to northrop on the b2 stealth 
bomber a program already slowed by defense cutbacks it also holds 
contracts for the small icbm mobile launcher the v22 
helicopterplane and the space station and is competing for the air 
forces multibillion dollar advanced tactical fighter contract 
all programs under close congressional scrutiny 
overall boeings defense segments have been losing money and 
were consolidated at the first of the year into boeing defense amp 
aerospace group the company trimmed 800 jobs as part of the 
consolidation but most of those people found jobs elsewhere in the 
company 
the divisions president b dan pinick has said he wants to 
cut overhead by 100 million which could entail the loss of some 
jobs 
thursdays announcement made no mention of any job losses at 
boeing plants outside the puget sound region binder said he did 
not have employment projections for company divisions elsewhere in 
the country 
layoff notices will be issued friday to about 1900 employees 
who might be among the 1700 workers laid off starting march 20 
the company said it said it will provide counseling and help 
laidoff workers find new jobs 
at the end of 1989 boeing had just under 106700 employees in 
washington state an increase of almost 10000 from the beginning 
of the year 
nationwide boeing employment grew by 10800 last year to 
145200

as congress moves toward enacting tougher air 
pollution controls one of the biggest mysteries is how much it 
will cost figures range from 14 billion a year to more than 100 
billion and some argue that doing nothing may be most expensive of 
all 
the nations largest corporations unveiled a study thursday 
suggesting that if some of the most stringent proposals for 
cleaning up the air are enacted the cost of compliance could soar 
as high as 104 billion a year 
the actual costs likely will be less conceded philip 
masciantonio a vice president at us steel a subsidiary of usx 
corp but he added even the studys 54 billion best estimate 
could be devastating to some industries 
the steel industrys coke ovens could be shut down by toxic 
chemical emission controls envisioned by a senate clean air bill 
he argued 
the study by the business roundtable an association of the 
heads of the 200 largest corporations was the latest estimate of 
how much the tighter air pollution controls now before congress 
will cost business and their customers and how they might 
affect the economy 
but supporters of the tough pollution controls argue inaction 
has a price tag of its own 
a study released today by the american lung association 
maintained that current air pollution from automobiles may be 
costing americans up to 93 billion a year in added health care 
expenses many of these costs would be eliminated under the 
pollution curbs being considered in congress the report said 
at a news conference the authors of the study said that while 
the 93 billion represents a high range they are confident from 
available data that health costs from breathing todays dirty air 
is costing society at least 40 billion to 50 billion about half 
of that from automobile pollution 
five years ago the highrange estimate was 40 billion a 
year today 40 billion has become the best estimate for midrange 
of the health costs associated to air pollution said fran 
dumelle director of government relations for the american lung 
association 
president bush has estimated that his proposal similar to 
legislation advancing in the house would cost from 14 billion to 
19 billion a year he urged congress on thursday to preserve the 
careful balance between cleaning up the air and preserving jobs 
democratic sponsors of a senate clean air bill expected to be 
brought to the floor next week say it is not much more expensive 
than the presidents version but the bush administration disagrees 
and opposes key provisions of it as being too costly 
the tougher air pollution controls before congress would require 
cuts in acid rain emissions from electric power plants automobile 
exhausts and toxic chemical releases from industrial plants 
annually the nation spends tens of billions of dollars trying 
to alleviate the very real human cost of dirty air and the costs of 
lung disease cancer and public health dangers associated with air 
pollution continue to rise says sen max baucus dmont chief 
sponsor of the senate bill 
the cost of cleaning up the nations air is high but the cost 
of not cleaning the air is even higher he continued 
environmentalists responding to the business roundtable cost 
estimates contended that industry exaggerated the expected impact 
of the 1970 clean air act when it was debated 20 years ago 
this is part of an industry ritual on the eve of any pollution 
control debate in congress they release inflated figures said 
richard ayres of the natural resources defense council also 
chairman of the clean air coalition 
likewise business interests and the bush administration dispute 
the senate democrats contention that their bill will be no more 
expensive than the presidents version 
a review of the senate bill by the environmental protection 
agency not yet released will show substantially higher cost 
figures said one administration official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
provisions in the senate bill calling for healthbased standards 
on toxic chemical releases from industrial plants and tighter auto 
emission controls both will be costly argues william fay 
executive of the clean air working group which speaks for industry 
his group has said the senate bill will at least double the 32 
billion that industry pays each year to meet current air pollution

president bush told the slumping homebuilding 
industry today that he wants interest rates to drop further and 
said a federal commission will study ways to make home ownership 
more affordable 
bush on the eve of the first anniversary of his inaugurastion 
declared the 1990s must be another decade of lower taxes and 
lower interest rates 
the president told several thousand members of the national 
association of homebuilders that congress must adopt fiscal 
policies as sound as those of the average american household 
bushs comments added impetus to administration efforts to 
pressure the federal reserve board into an easier credit policy 
we cannot allow the high costs of housing to suffocate the 
financial life of americas young people the president said 
when it comes to housing this must not become a society of haves 
and havenots 
observing that the cost of new homes has been steadily 
increasing for the past decade and a half bush said more and 
more young americans are finding themselves priced out of the home 
market 
he vowed to work with housing secretary jack kemp to cut federal 
red tape to create decent housing that people can afford 
he noted that he had asked kemp to convene a commission that 
would study burdensome bureaucratic barriers to affordable housing 
construction and make recommendations on how to eliminate them 
he offered no details 
but the truth is theres one housing policy and one sales 
strategy thats better than all others combined a healthy growing 
economy with low longterm interest rates bush declared 
vital to homebuyer and homebuilder alike are low and stable 
rates of interest the president added claiming that each 
increase of one percentage point in the interest rate knocks 
millions of families out of the market 
bushs comments and those by other administration officials come 
amid speculation that momentum at the fed for easing credit policy 
had ended 
as he has done in nearly all of his speeches this year bush 
also called on congress to act on items that he proposed last year 
especially his proposal for a cut in the tax rate on capital gains 
the profit from sales of investments 
i call on the democrat leaders of congress to give the 
american people a break and to let the house and senate work their 
will by having an upanddown vote on the capital gains tax cut 
bush said 
he also the homebuilders organization that he stands firm in his 
opposition to massive new government public housing projects and 
will press again in the upcoming session of congress for a plan to 
give public housing tenants vouchers to make it easier for them to 
buy their own units 
bush made a special point of praising former president carter 
and his wife rosalynn as a point of light for working with an 
organization that helps provide lowcost shelter 
the president also departed from his prepared text to tell the 
homeowners that he was annoyed to see so many suburbs denuded of 
trees when builders clear new tracts and subdivisions and asked 
them to save some both for the sake of business and for the 
environment 
several hecklers holding a sign protesting us aid to the 
government of el salvador jeered bush briefly from the back of the 
hall before being led away by security officers 
bush took note of a planned white supremacist march saturday 
near the martin luther king center in atlanta 
atlanta is a great cheerful city that has proudly risen from 
the ashes of a distant past he said and for those who plan to 
revel in a rally of hate here tomorrow let them know this 
atlantans like all americans turn their backs on bigots 
following his speech in atlantas omni coliseum the president 
was flying to florida for a lateafternoon tour and briefing at 
everglades national park and to speak at a fundraising dinner in 
miami for republican gov bob martinezs reelection campaign 
on thursday white house press secretary marlin fitzwater urged 
lower interest rates breaking the administrations general policy 
of not commenting on fed policy 
this is not a new message but its important occasionally to 
point out that lower interest rates are normally good for the 
economy he said 
furthermore he said fed members should take a close look at 
recent economic indicators which show moderate inflation and 
sluggishness in retail sales and housing and understand these 
numbers are low and indicate inflation has remained very steady 
over the last seven or eight years and that lower interest rates 
are justified 
the administrations statement on interest rate policy comes 
amid speculation that momentum for lower rates at the fed had ended 
no one would welcome lower rates more than the homebuilders who 
have just finished their worst year since the recession of 1982 
the housing industry was sluggish through most of 1989 as the 
fed pushed up interest rates as it sought to slow the economy and 
curtail inflation 
as concerns grew that the economy might be slowing too much the 
fed allowed interest rates to gradually fall in recent months but 
not by enough to help the homebuilding industry 
david seiders chief economist for the organization bush was 
addressing said he is counting on a moderate decline in interest 
rates in the first half of the year to sustain his organizations 
forecast for a better year this year 
the commerce department on thursday reported that housing starts 
construction begun on new homes and apartments tumbled by 8 
percent in december the worst performance since october 1982 
fitzwater said the plunge was not good news although 
analysts blamed much of the drop on unseasonably cold weather in 
much of the nation

the pillsbury dough boy has undergone a 
dizzying year of change under new owner grand metropolitan plc as 
the british conglomerate made painful cuts that many inside the 
food company say were overdue 
there had been a strangulation of the organization too many 
layers said former pillsbury executive david webber it wasnt 
like a smoothrunning machine that all of a sudden toppled 
the transformation began jan 4 1989 when londonbased grand 
met acquired pillsbury for 58 billion ending a hostile takeover 
bid that included expensive court battles in minnesota and delaware 
the changes have ranged from a revamping of pillsburys burger 
king fastfood subsidiary to the sale of seafood and restaurant 
businesses and the closure of unproductive facilities 
another major restructuring was announced thursday a 140 
million investment to modernize food plants and lay off 1300 
workers over the next 18 months the job losses could be offset by 
at least 800 new jobs the company said 
the restructuring will reduce to about 57000 the number of 
employees at pillsbury and at burger king headquarters and 
companyowned stores pillsbury and burger king operate separately 
my favorite analogy is burning our boats in the bay said 
ian martin pillsburys new chief executive officer and a grand met 
veteran i like to stand with my troops on the hillside and say 
there stand the boats theyre burning were not going back out 
by sea the only way we win is by going over the hill 
webber said martin wasted no time demonstrating the gungho 
approach the 11year pillsbury executive was fired in july and 
received a generous severance package after presenting a flat 
sales projection for the beleaguered frozen pizza division 
in my terms martin said thats planning for failure 
the changes have coincided with a 30 percent increase in 
operating income at pillsbury over the first nine months of 1989 
compared with the same period a year earlier grand met says the 
company does not disclose net profit for pillsbury 
grand met with 1989 sales of 95 billion is staking 
pillsburys future largely on its green giant vegetables the line 
of baking products represented by the dough boy haagendazs ice 
cream frozen pizza and burger king the fastfood unit reported 
sales of 54 billion last year and added 119 million to grand 
mets operating profit for the year ended sept 30 
besides beefing up burger kings advertising campaign grand met 
has appointed haagendazs quality control executive sam yong to 
improve quality at the chain an area considered one of its faults 
they are more decisive they dont hesitate said william 
pothitos a burger king franchisee in montreal the last regime 
used to manage by committee 
said webber of the man who fired him i do think ian martin 
was a very welcome addition there had been a strangulation of the 
organization too many layers 
under former chairman william spoor pillsbury routinely 
underwent doubledigit growth but the company grew awkward and 
after john stafford took control in 1985 it sputtered profits 
which hit 2081 million in fiscal 1986 were headed for a dismal 
693 million in fiscal 1988 when spoor returned from retirement to 
replace stafford 
by then the company was ripe for a takeover and philip l smith 
hired from the former general foods corp had been chairman less 
than a month when grand met made its unsolicited tender offer of 
60 a share on oct 4 smith ultimately left with a golden 
parachute severance payment worth more than 8 million 
martin said pillsbury had been suffering from inertia 
most of the plans carried out by grand met were somewhere in 
the bowels of the organization he said we just went ahead and 
did it i dont know somehow they seemed to have bruised feet in 
the starting blocks 
when i move i move quickly he said 
b sham moteelall 39 the former transportation manager for the 
industrial foods division and one of the victims of grand mets 
drastic restructuring thinks martin moved too quickly 
i figured i was the guy who was going to survive said 
moteelall who was fired during an office champagne party in april 
when they start herding people out the doors how do they know 
theyre herding the right ones how do they know theyre not 
cutting into the bone

an organization that represents 
airline passengers on friday called for a 1 levy on all air 
tickets to finance a 1 billion program to improve airline security 
and fight terrorism 
geoffrey lipman secretarygeneral of the international 
foundation for airline passengers said such a fund would 
contribute towards research into more sophisticated security 
technology and improved training of airline staff particularly in 
third world countries 
he cited a survey by the foundation that showed 80 percent of 
travelers questioned would support such a charge on tickets the 
proposed fund would supplement existing security expenditures by 
governments and airlines lipman added 
some us airlines such as pan am and trans world airlines add 
5 to the cost of a transatlantic ticket to cover security 
screening for international flights 
it is not a question of the money its the organization and 
the motivation he told an american international club audience 
in geneva 
its the need to battle against the kind of inertia that sets 
in 12 months after lockerbie he said referring to the bomb that 
downed pan am flight 103 over scotland on dec 21 1988 killing 
all 259 people on board and 11 people on the ground 
lipman called for tougher international action including 
severing aviation links with countries known to support or protect 
air terrorists 
he said that although many airports had tightened safety 
procedures much more needed to be done to implement existing 
security conventions on issues such as baggage checks 
in washington the federal aviation administration met friday 
with us airline industry representatives on security issues the 
agency was expected to appeal to the airlines not to go public when 
they receive terrorist threats against passenger flights

unsuspecting widows who say they lost it all 
because of irresponsible brokers entrusted with the nest egg they 
dont make this stuff up 
elfy willdorff 65 of new york claims she lost more than 1 
million in the october 1987 stock market crash because of risky 
trading by shearson lehman hutton inc 
legal papers filed in her arbitration case show mrs willdorff 
opened a retail account at shearson in 1983 with her life savings 
including money left by her husband who ran a small dental supply 
business 
the claim accuses broker walter kovler himself around 80 years 
old with unsuitable and unsupervised trading in speculative stock 
options using the conservative stockandbond portfolio she brought 
to the wall street firm 
mrs willdorffs case typifies disputes resolved out of court in 
arbitration before a panel usually consisting of two independent 
arbitrators and one from the securities industry 
this is the horror that occurred to thousands of unwitting 
small investors who will never be able to recover from what 
happened in 1987 said attorney theodore eppenstein mrs 
willdorff went from a millionaire to insolvency in a few weeks 
when mrs willdorff opened her account she signed a contract 
requiring her to submit any grievance to arbitration forfeiting 
the right to sue the supreme court last year upheld such contracts 
mrs willdorff will be bound by the decision of the arbitration 
panel with limited rights of appeal studies show investors win 
about half their cases and victorious plaintiffs recover about half 
their losses 
eppenstein who unsuccessfully argued the supreme court case on 
arbitrations contracts said that given the size of the claim he 
would have sued shearson rather than arbitrate 
theodore a krebsbach shearsons litigation director declined 
to comment because arbitration proceedings are supposed to be 
private i think any claimant would be upset with us if we went 
public with the facts of a case that was pending he said 
germanborn mrs willdorff separated from her parents in 1939 
and taken to england as part of a wartime child rescue mission had 
invested in bluechip securities until she took her account to 
shearson the legal papers state 
her account statements show total equity of 938164 on sept 
27 1987 which turned into a deficit of 400145 on oct 31 12 
days after the crash 
the complaint says shearson engaged in risky options trading 
that was unsuitable given mrs willdorffs age financial needs and 
investing history a common claim in customerbroker disputes 
options trading is highly speculative but generates higher broker 
commissions than routine stock transactions 
the complaint states mrs willdorffs income is about 10000 a 
year from the dental supply business social security and west 
german wartime reparations payments the papers say shearson knew 
she relied on her account for living expenses including a 
rentstabilized onebedroom apartment in manhattan 
the papers also claim shearson failed to supervise the broker 
breached a duty to act in the customers best interest reassured 
mrs willdorff that her investments were safe and failed to tell 
her when her money evaporated

the st lawrence seaway handled a record 15 
million metric tons of export steel in 1989 but total cargo tonnage 
declined 34 million metric tons due largely to a drop in canadian 
grain shipments according to preliminary yearend statistics 
the seaway handled 422 percent more export steel this year 
than it did last year said james l emery administrator of the 
saint lawrence seaway development corp which operates the us 
portion of the inland waterway 
in 1988 287000 metric tons of export steel traversed the 
waterway which runs from the atlantic ocean through the great 
lakes to duluth minn the previous record year for export steel 
through the seaway was 1982 when 125 million metric tons were 
moved 
seventy percent of us steel production is in the great lakes 
region and obviously the seaway has been increasing its share of 
that steel emery said in a statement thursday 
nationally us steel exports are estimated to have reached 36 
million metric tons in 1989 double 1988s total according to the 
american iron and steel institute 
the institute attributed the jump in us steel exports to the 
low value of the dollar an improvement in steel quality intense 
marketing of us steel in europe and the far east and improved 
productivity 
stone and salt were also shipped through the seaway in record 
amounts stone was up 4 percent from 432000 metric tons in 1988 
to 448000 metric tons salt increased 34 percent from one million 
metric tons in 1988 to 13 million metric tons 
on the downside canadian grain shipments through the seaway 
dropped 42 million metric tons last year according to the seaway 
corporation 
other declines were seen in fuel oil which dropped 35 percent 
chemicals down 22 percent coke down 13 percent and scrap iron 
and steel 14 percent 
as a result total seaway tonnage dropped to 371 million metric 
tons a 9 percent decline from 1988s total of 405 million metric 
tons 
while all these figures were preliminary emery said the final 
tonnages would vary by a few metric tons if at all when they are 
released next month 
almost 2800 commercial vessels traveled through us seaway 
locks in 1989 on average they carried cargo weighing 17292 tons 
about 2 percent more than in 1988 the corporation said 
the last vessel cleared the seaway on dec 23 and the waterway 
was closed for the winter locks are now undergoing improvements 
and winter maintenance

federal regulators are putting off a decision 
on whether to act against neil bush the presidents son after 
reviewing information from an investigation of bushs role in the 
failure of a colorado thrift association 
an internal committee of the office of thrift supervision met 
into the evening thursday and said friday that it would reconvene 
tuesday on the matter 
meanwhile the thrift office a bureau of the treasury 
department said in a statement that w james metz majority 
stockholder of silverado became the fourth officer of the thrift 
to accept a lifetime ban from working for a federally insured 
financial institution 
bush 34 was a director of silverado banking savings and loan 
association denver from 1985 until august 1988 when his father 
accepted the republican presidential nonimation 
regulators shut down the thrift in december 1988 blaming the 
institutions management for heavily investing in colorados ailing 
commercial real estate market 
the collapse of silverado now operating as part of columbia 
savings the largest thrift in colorado is expected to cost 
taxpayers up to 1 billion 
regulators are focusing their investigation on what they said 
was an exceptionally large number of problem transactions 
between silverado insiders and borrowers

exploration had business deals with two of silverados major 
borrowers developers bill l walters and ken good 
bush has said in interviews that he has nothing to hide and is 
cooperating fully with investigators he met several times last 
week with thrift office enforcement officials 
possible civil penalties bush could receive range from banning 
him from the industry to ordering him to refrain from violating 
banking regulations in the future such civil penalties would not 
interfere with any later criminal prosecution if one was indicated 
separately the federal deposit insurance corp is considering 
whether to file a civil suit against the sampls officers and 
director seeking recovery of silverados losses 
a former federal sampl examiner james moroney has alleged that

connections 
regulators in washington have said they investigated moroneys 
allegations and found them invalid bush has said he never sought 
to use his political connections and would not have if asked 
metz agreed to the industry ban without admitting or denying 
wrongdoing he will be prohibited from working for an sampl bank or 
credit union without prior approval from regulators 
previously former silverado chairman michael r wise and former

western european foreign ministers will gather 
saturday amid mounting calls to deepen their political union and 
come up with more money for eastern europe 
the special session of the 12nation european community in 
dublin castle ireland follows a bold call this week from the 
communitys executive body the european commission for 
accelerated political and economic unity 
european commission president jacques delors suggested the 
community increase its budget by 165 billion to aid eastern 
europe and indicated that east germany could soon join the european 
community 
france and west germany pressing the pace for closer union 
backed the suggestion but britain immediately signaled caution and 
opposed new loans to eastern europes six emerging democracies 
hungary poland czechoslovakia east germany bulgaria and romania 
britain contends the east bloc nations are already deep in debt 
and says the emphasis should be on training in the running of a 
free enterprise economy 
ireland which on jan 1 took over the sixmonth rotating 
presidency of the european community was anxious to avoid an open 
dispute but the irish foreign ministry acknowledged friday there 
were differences of emphasis between the community countries 
irish foreign minister gerry collins summoned the saturday night 
meeting to review the fastchanging situation in eastern europe 
but the meeting also is likely to rekindle differences over 
political and monetary integration 
delors a french socialist called for a new institutional 
structure for the community implying wideranging new powers for 
the brusselsbased commission over national governments in london 
british prime minister margaret thatcher described his remarks as a 
great pity 
delors also envisaged special links between the community and 
the six eastern european countries adding east germany was a 
special case 
there is a place for east germany in the community should it 
so wish he said 
the european community is coordinating aid to the emerging 
democracies of eastern europe at the request of last julys summit 
in paris of the worlds seven most industrialized cuntries the 
united states japan canada france west germany britain and 
italy 
at that time only poland and hungary had moved away from 
communist rule aid totalling some 6 billion has been pledged by 
24 western countries to poland and hungary since then western 
nations have offered similar help to the four other countries 
proposed aid includes a development bank called the european 
bank for reconstruction and development in eastern europe

wheat and soybean futures prices fell friday on 
the chicago board of trade dropping sharply near the close on 
selling linked to slack export demand and improved growing 
conditions for winter wheat and south american soybeans 
corn futures finished narrowly mixed 
wheat futures sank to their lowest levels in almost four months 
extending a decline that began thursday when large amounts of snow 
and rain began falling on wheat fields from the texas panhandle to 
western kansas 
but fridays pattern of steep losses only in the march and may 
wheat contracts indicated the selling was inspired more by slack 
export demand than the beneficial weather said jerry zusel 
manager of exchange floor operations for balfour maclaine corp 
in the wheat market the march and may contracts represent 
stockpiled grain while contracts for later delivery represent the 
new crop 
i think todays action at least for soft red winter wheat 
signals that oldcrop wheat is very expensive and prospects for any 
new business is not very great in the near term zusel said 
the soybean market has been trending lower all week on reports 
of rain in southern brazil an important soybeangrowing region 
at the close wheat futures were cent to 5 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in march at 392 a bushel corn was 
cent lower to cent higher with march at 241 a bushel oats 
were unchanged to cent higher with march at 138 a bushel 
soybeans were 1 cent to 5 cents lower with january at 557 a

china harvested a record 4079 million tons of 
grain last year the official china daily reported friday 
agriculture minister he kang speaking at an agricultural 
conference thursday also said 1 million scientists and teachers 
will be sent to the countryside this year as part of a drive to 
further increase grain output 
china reached its previous high of 4073 million tons in 1984 
but output fell to 379 million tons in 1985 the first of four 
straight disappointing harvests 
in 1989 grain production was 394 million tons 
the poor crops resulted from bad weather and a decrease in land 
devoted to grain crops farmers recently have built houses or small 
factories on farmland or switching to vegetables and other crops 
that pay better than grain 
the government concerned the nation was losing its ability to 
feed itself has tightened restrictions on the conversion of 
farmland and urged farmers to meet their quotas for grain last 
year it also increased subsidies to rural areas after 1988 when 
local banks ran out of money to pay farmers and were forced to 
issue ious 
he said fields planted with grain increased by 49 million acres 
last year to about 272 million acres 
he said the central budget had budgeted 39 billion for 
agricultural production in 1990 an increase of about 425 million 
agriculture experts have said china must produce 500 million 
tons of grain annually by 2000 just to keep up with population 
growth

the first kentucky fried chicken restaurant 
is being restored as a working museum in this southeastern kentucky 
town which hatched a business that now has 5 billion in sales in 
58 countries 
officials working on the restoration hope to finish the project 
in time for the 100th birthday of the restaurants founder col 
harland sanders the unveiling of the new museum will coincide with 
laurel countys 1990 world chicken festival 
the restaurant and motel originally were called sanders court 
and cafe thats where the colonel developed and perfected his 
famous recipe and the technique of pressure frying said wallace 
hebert marketing director for jrn inc owner of the franchise 
there are now 7900 kentucky fried chicken restaurants in the 
united states and 57 foreign countries including one in tiananmen 
square in beijing china said richard detwiler a spokesman for 
kentucky fried chicken corp retail sales were 5 billion in 1988 
he said 
franchise owner john r neal has wanted to restore the original 
restaurant for many years said hebert it was closed in september 
1988 and moved to a temporary location next door 
a restoration team is advertising to purchase any artifacts from 
the original restaurant which opened in 1940 including furniture 
menus and kitchen utensils he said members of the community have 
donated silverware old uniforms tables chairs and other items 
from the old restaurant 
one of the more unusual features of the old sanders court and 
cafe was a model motel room that guests had to pass through in 
order to use the bathroom or the pay telephone said hebert this 
was sanders marketing strategy to show people the quality of the 
motel rooms and boost his motel business said hebert 
he was a shrewd marketer he really was he said 
an official with the laurel county tourism commission said he 
hopes the museum and the chicken festival which will feature 
cooking contests two parades and a col sanders lookalike 
contest will boost the regions tourist economy 
we hope to make this an annual event said ken harvey of the

federal regulators on friday denied 
californias home savings of america the largest and one of the 
healthiest thrift institutions in the nation permission to switch 
to the insurance fund backing commercial bank deposits 
home savings whose deposits are insured by the savings 
association insurance fund had applied to merge with its 
whollyowned subsidiary bowery savings bank of new york which is 
already insured by the bank insurance fund members of the savings 
fund pay higher deposit insurance premiums than members of the bank 
fund 
the office of thrift supervision said it denied the switch 
because sampl bailout legislation passed last august bars thrifts 
from pulling out of the savings association insurance fund for five 
years 
home savings had applied for the switch to the thrift offices 
predecessor the federal home loan bank board before the law was 
enacted 
the thrift already has filed a federal lawsuit trying to 
complete the bowery merger and spokeswoman mary triggs said home 
would continue to fight that case in the courts 
the irwindale calif thrift had assets of 44 billion on dec 
31 its withdrawal from the savings insurance fund would be a major 
blow to the fund which is intended to pay for sampl failures after 
the money from the bailout bill runs out

656 for every 1000 in face value its yield which falls when 
prices advance slipped to 826 percent from 833 percent late 
thursday

support our market as well 
it does look like weve reached bond price levels where 
were attracting some foreign demand said william v sullivan 
director of money market research at dean witter reynolds inc 
bond prices tumbled 2932 point or about 9 per 1000 face 
amount on thursday in reaction to increased fears of inflation and 
comments by two federal reserve board governors that they did had 
no plans to ease monetary policy 
the government reported the highest yearend inflation rate in 
eight years and economists forecast a sharp rise in consumer prices 
in january which depressed the bond market 
the market had little reaction to a survey released friday by 
the feds philadelphia bureau that the economy was increasing 
slightly in january in the region 
it also did not react strongly to president bush calling for

directly said the fed should lower interest rates 
lower interest rates which encourage businesses and banks to 
borrow money increasing demand for bonds send prices of 
government securities higher

state regulators are considering whether 
longdistance phone companies should be required to provide 
information about competing services when they suffer outages like 
the one that crippled atampts network on monday 
we want to make sure that a customer who wants to make a phone 
call can get the information to get a carrier to complete the 
call said george dawson a spokesman for the state board of 
public utilities 
atampts longdistance service nationwide was out for nine hours 
on monday company officials traced the problem to a bug in a new 
software program 
dawson said bpu officals had read news accounts of people who 
complained that during the outage atampt operators refused to give 
out the access codes of the nations two other major longdistance 
carriers mci and us sprint 
dawson said the board itself had received no complaints 
i dont think anybody is thinking that atampt has the 
responsibility to pick another carrier for the caller dawson 
said but he said longdistance companies and the states two local 
telephone companies new jersey bell and united telephone are 
required as public utilities to provide any telephone numbers 
requested including those of competinglongdistance companies 
new jersey has six longdistance carriers and a seventh company 
that transmits data long distance dawson said twenty companies 
package longdistance service for resale 
atampt spokesman harry baumgartner said the company was concerned 
that whatever rule the bpu proposed would equitably apply to all 
longdistance companies 
baumgartner said that more than 400 longdistance companies 
operated nationally plus another 300 alternative operator 
services its extremely difficult if not impossible to track 
all of their access codes he said 
moreover he said atampt does not want to be in the position of 
making preferential decisions in telling callers which competitor 
to call 
mondays outage struck quickly and unexpectedly and atampt did 
not have working procedures in place for its operators baumgartner 
said atampt changed procedures to allow operators to provide the 
access codes at about 6 pm 
new jersey bell operators do not give access codes but will 
provide telephone numbers for people to call to obtain the codes 
said new jersey bell spokeswoman karen johnson 
we are really prohibited from giving out carrierspecific 
information and we feel the access codes fall into that 
category ms johnson said she said many long distance companies 
did not want other companies giving out their access codes 
united telephone operators may not recommend long distance 
carriers said glenn lewis a united spokesman he said the company 
did check with its lawyers during the outage to see what 
information operators could give out

copper futures prices fell sharply friday on new yorks 
commodity exchange reflecting fears of an economic slowdown which 
would reduce demand for the metal 
on other commodity markets precious metals were mixed oil 
futures rose grains and soybeans were mostly lower and livestock 
and meat futures were mixed 
copper futures finished 17 cents to 305 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in january at 101 a pound the more heavily 
traded march contract settled at 9930 cents a pound 
the selloff extended thursdays more moderate decline and 
resulted from growing perceptions that copper demand is slackening 
after more than two years of strong consumption analysts said 
what really highlighted the fact that demand is likely to 
weaken is the recent stock market weakness said james steel a 
metals analyst with the futures brokerage refco inc 
with the us stock market going down and the london and 
japanese markets going down also thats a clear indication that as 
we go into 1990 demand will be soft he said 
thursdays commerce department report of an 8 percent drop in 
housing starts to the lowest level in seven years supported 
perceptions of an economic slowdown as did announcements of worker 
layoffs by several large manufacturers 
copper demand is closely tied to the nations economic health 
especially to the construction industry which accounts for more 
than 40 percent of copper usage 
analyst bette raptopoulos of prudentialbache securities inc 
noted a lack of buying recently on the physical copper market at a 
time when copper consumption is normally on the rise 
in preciousmetals trading on the comex gold futures settled 
unchanged to 30 cents lower with february at 41090 a troy ounce 
silver was 1 cent to 12 cents higher with march at 525 a troy 
ounce 
petroleum futures climbed sharply on the new york mercantile 
exchange led by the februry crude oil contract which expires on 
monday 
the buying of crude was mainly due to concerns about a possible 
squeeze in supplies of crude for delivery against the february 
contract analysts said 
heating oil rallied and gasoline followed as temperatures fell 
in the northeast after several days of springlike conditions

fell 35 percent in the octoberdecember quarter largely because

gain 
profits in the companys fiscal first quarter totalled 130 
million or 203 a share down from 202 million or 299 a share a 
year earlier 
the yearearlier profit figure was boosted by a 70 million gain 
on the sale of van camp seafood co the maker of chicken of the 
sea tuna fish 
if that onetime gain were not included ralstons earnings per 
share would have increased to 203 from 194 
sales rose 11 percent to 188 billion from 168 billion 
when you read everthing in i think its a very positive 
quarter said roger spencer an analyst at painewebber in chicago 
ralston spokesman pat farrell said higher advertising and 
promotion costs for the introduction of several kinds of dog snacks 
trimmed profits in the quarter

335 million to finance shipments of new merchandise for their 
stores 
figures released by the companies show federated department 
stores inc has a current cash balance of 220 million and allied 
stores corp has 117 million in cash 
federated and allied which filed monday for us bankruptcy 
court protection from their creditors also have arranged credit 
lines totalling 700 million to finance their reorganizations 
the company said we had sufficient cash to maintain operations 
without the reorganization financing spokeswoman carol sanger 
said allied said it wouldnt need to draw on the reorganization 
financing until march and federated said it wouldnt need to use 
the new financing until the fall season 
some suppliers including liz claiborne and leslie fay began 
new shipments to campeaus stores thursday while many others said 
they were withholding merchandise until they see the retailers 
financing 
retail industry analysts had identified renewed merchandise 
shipments as the most pressing need for the chains stores 
especially those in the south where the spring selling season 
begins soon 
meanwhile federated and allied were preparing teams of 
executives to visit stores to explain operations under bankruptcy 
court protection ms sanger said 
the operation of the stores will continue unchanged this is 
just to assure them that they are having all their questions 
answered she said 
top executives of chains belonging to federated and allied 
visited the cincinnati headquarters for briefings wednesday 
in their bankruptcy court filing federated and allied listed 
total assets of 91 billion and debts of 77 billion the

reorganization from a group of banks led by citibank of new york 
allied says it has a similar agreement for 300 million from 
chemical bank both agreements still need bankruptcy court approval 
court approval for the retailers reorganization credit lines 
should take four to six weeks ms sanger said 
its not finalized yet but then we have no need of it yet and 
we dont anticipate needing it for quite some time she said 
the first hearing in the case is scheduled for next thursday 
when us bankruptcy judge j vincent aug will consider a request

telecommunications incs plan to spin off a new 
company to handle its programming interests will help it deal with 
possible regulatory constraints and to continue to grow industry 
analysts said friday 
tci is the nations largest cable system operator and also has 
extensive interests in cable programming including a 22 percent 
stake in turner broadcasting system inc 
on thursday john malone tcis chief executive officer said 
the tci board authorized management to develop a plan to form and 
distribute to shareholders a new company that would contain its 
programming interests its minority interest in some cable systems 
and other cable service businesses 
the spinoff would create a new growth vehicle for tci 
shareholders unencumbered of potential regulatory constraints or 
conflicting objectives he said 
the announcement came after the close of trading on thursday in 
national overthecounter trading tci rose 237 a share to 
1737 on friday 
the cable industry has come under increasing criticism in recent 
months in congress because of rate increases over the past three 
years and because of the perceived influence some major operators 
have for determining whether new cable programs can be included 
among serviuces available on certain cable systems 
legislation has been proposed to regulate rates again for the 
first time since 1986 and to prohibit cable systems from owning 
interests in the programs they carry 
john reidy an analyst with drexel burnham lambert in new york 
said the move would take the steam out of these legislative 
initiatives 
the segregation of programming interests into a new company 
will really blunt the regulatory thrust he said 
the proposed spinoff would also help stockholders and investors 
focus on tcis values and create a growth vehicle for the giant 
cable company said michael kupinski a cable analyst for ag 
edwards amp sons of st louis 
tci which has about 11 million subscribers had 1988 sales of 
22 billion 
malone said the planned spinoff would be similar to earlier 
spinoffs of westmarc communications in 1984 and republic pictures 
in 1985 
the company said the tci that will remain after the divestiture 
will be devoted to managing the bulk of its present cable systems 
which includes about 18 percent of the nations cable subscribers 
tci said the decision to spin off assets came at a routine board 
of directors meeting during which tci executives reportedly 
expressed dismay at how the companys stock has been faring in wall 
street the stock with other cable issues has been depressed for 
several months due to regulatory fears 
besides turner broadcasting tci owns a 50 percent stake in the 
american movie classics cable channel a 49 percent interest in the 
discovery channel and a 14 percent stake in black entertainment 
television tci also has an interest in prime network a regional 
sports programming partnership that includes denvers prime sports 
network and recently agreed to acquire a 50 percent interest in 
the showtime pay cable service 
tci executives said that in addition to the programming 
properties tci could transfer cable systems with 1 million to 25 
million subscribers into the new corporation other properties 
reportedly being considered include the netlink satellite service 
business which packages cable programming for homedish owners

a federal appeals court friday threw out a bid 
by the urban mass transportation administration to test local 
transit system employees for drug use including random testing 
the us district court of appeals for the district of columbia 
said the agency had exceeded its congressionally mandated authority 
in trying to impose uniform nationwide rules on local transit 
authorities 
we believe that congress intended for such matters to be 
handled locally with umtas guiding hand not with an iron fist 
the court said in an opinion filed by chief judge patricia m wald 
the decison upheld an appeal by transport unions and reversed an 
earlier decision by the us district court 
the court battle began shortly after the authority issued 
regulations in december 1988 requiring all local transit systems 
receiving federal funds to assure a drugfree workforce 
the regulations similar to rules established for transport 
workers under the jurisdiction of the department of transportation 
called for urinalysis testing of employees before employment after 
an accident when reasonable suspicion of drug use existed 
randomly and before an employee suspended for drug use was allowed 
to return to work 
the amalgamated transit union and the transport workers union of 
america contended the transport agency had no authority to impose a 
federal drugtesting program on all recipients of federal mass 
transit money 
jim la sala president of the amalgamated transit union said 
friday that the umtas attempt to impose national standards was 
overkill and not sensitive to local concerns or issues 
local unions and mass transit employers are wellsuited to 
themselves reach decisions on drug testing and employee assistance 
programs that reflect each local situation la sala said there 
is no evidence of widespread drug use nationally in the mass 
transit industry and the umta knows it 
the opinion said congress had given local transit authorities 
not the federal agency the power to submit locally designed plans 
to deal with safety hazards including drug abuse 
a bid by the federal government to mandate a uniform national 
plan that is not in any respect tailored to local needs and 
circumstances cannot be squared with the language or intent of 
the legislation enacted by congress the court said 
unless and until congress chooses to confer such authority to 
umta over safety matters umtas uniform national antidrug 
program regulations do not represent a valid exercise of its 
statutory authority the court said

after some mixed signals from federal 
regulators earlier this month the nations five options exchanges 
are set to begin trading on new listings monday 
but most exchanges will be offering new options on far fewer 
stocks than originally planned because the securities and exchange 
commission which regulates options hasnt changed its rules yet 
options are financial instruments that give holders that right 
to buy or sell 100 shares of a stock at a designated price for a 
certain amount of time 
options are traded on stocks listed on exchanges or traded over 
the counter 
currently most options on the stocks listed on an exchange can 
only be traded in one marketplace at a time the privilege of 
trading a specific option assigned by lottery is not permitted on 
any other exchange 
but thanks to a rule passed by the sec last may that 
exclusivity will end on jan 22 
the new sec rule will allow for the multiple listing of all 
options 
but earlier this month sec chairman richard c breeden asked 
the exchanges to voluntarily limit their multiple listings to new 
options while maintaining the exclusivity of listings for existing 
options 
breeden asked the exchanges to delay phasing in the existing 
options until june to allow development of some way to link all the 
markets so investors can have access to the best deal 
the allocation plan or lottery is abolished as of monday for 
new options said bonnie greenberg of the chicago board options 
exchange the worlds biggest options exchange 
on monday the american stock exchange in new york will list 
options in the stock of fleetnorstar financial group inc racal 
telecom plc and sothebys holdings plc 
options on sothebys also will be offered on the cboe and the 
pacific stock exchange 
but all of those exchanges had planned to list many more 
options expecting new rules that would lower the eligibility 
requirements for stocks to have options listed the sec however 
informed the exchanges earlier this month that the lower 
requirements hadnt been approved yet and the old standards were 
still in effect 
we intended to trade 31 options if certain requirements were 
met said roy berces a spokesman for the pacific stock exchange 
instead he said the pacific exchange will be listing just three 
options norwest corp sundstrand corp and sothebys

united technologies corp on friday 
announced that the company is adopting a new ethics code governing 
the professional conduct of the company and its 185000 employees 
the announcement came a little more than a year after the 
defense giant came under scrutiny during a pentagon investigation 
into military procurement practices but a company spokesman said 
the probe had nothing to do with the new ethics policy 
in outlining the plan during a meeting friday with top 
executives that was telecast to 13 utc offices around the country 
robert f daniell utc chairman and chief executive officer said 
the code was drafted in response to increased public attention on 
corporate ethics in recent years 
utc top management and its board of directors decided that 
public expectations should be addressed by issuing a code of ethics 
which clearly states the corporations principles and established 
standards of conduct daniell said in a statement 
the pentagons procurement investigation began in the fall of 
1988 and focused on allegations that us defense officials were 
bribed for confidential contract information 
utc spokeswoman peg hashem said daniell was asked by an employee 
on friday about whether the new policy was a response to the 
investigation hashem quoting daniell as responding absolutely 
not 
he said that over the past several years we have placed a lot 
of emphasis on defenserelated issues in the ethics area and about 
midyear of 1989 top management began discussions about whether we 
shouldnt broaden our focus and come up with a comprehensive ethics 
code that we would apply across utc both for our commercial and 
aerospace side said ms hashem 
its not that we didnt have an ethics code before we did 
she said we had lots of policies addressing ethics but this was 
an effort to pull it together in a comprehensive way and well be 
applying it consistently across utc 
pratt amp whitney the jet engine division of utc became a focus 
of the probe amid allegations that a company official had obtained 
confidential contract information from general electric co a 
chief competitor for military jet engine contracts the probe 
dubbed ill wind by federal officials is ongoing a 
congressional source who insisted on anonymity said friday 
in his remarks to employees daniell said the new code spells 
out what the company can and cannot do in its worldwide 
operations 
we can and should take great pride in our reputation and we 
must commit ourselves to its continuation as the basis for our 
future success he said 
daniell also announced the formation of a new business practices 
unit to oversee the new ethics code 
the office will be made up of a network of business practices 
officers at each of the companys operating units the officers 
will be available for employees to obtain information guidance and 
interpretation relating to the ethics code 
frank w mcabee former vice presidentgovernment contracts and 
compliance has been named vice president of business practices 
and will oversee the new unit and be in charge of enforcing the new 
code

a business newsletter ordered last week to halt 
publication of an article containing confidential information about 
a major accounting firm sent out a special edition friday with the 
story 
the move came one day after a new york state appellate judge 
ruled that the information already published by the new york 
times could not be kept sealed by a lower court and ordered the 
documents released to the news media 
arthur bowman editor of bowmans accounting report said the 
fourpage special edition contained the article about ernst amp young 
he was forced to kill earlier this month between the time of the 
restraining order jan 8 and the appeals court action on thursday 
the times also obtained the information and published a story 
we have already published bowman said friday its in the 
mail 
the special edition of bowmans also contains an editors note 
about the legal battle 
we deeply regret finding ourselves embroiled in a legal 
dispute with a respected member of the accounting profession 
the message said however we also feel strongly that protection 
of the first amendment overrides other considerations 
we are pleased to put this episode behind us 
the atlanta newsletters fight with ernst amp young drew the 
interest of many large news organizations several of whom joined 
in support of bowmans ernst amp young contended that the 
information in the articles was proprietary and the firms lawyers 
compared it with cocacolas secret formula 
the news organizations who joined bowmans in charging that new 
york supreme court judge beatrice shainswits original order was an 
unconstitutional abridgement of press freedom include the 
associated press the society of professsional journalists the new 
york times the atlanta journalconstitution the wall street 
journal the newsletter association the new york daily news 
newsday and american lawyer 
also submitting a friend of the court brief on behalf of 
bowmans was the new york civil liberties union 
the bowmans article contained information similar to that which 
was in the newspaper story about the firm that resulted from the 
merger of ernst amp whinney and arthur young 
among other things the articles said ernst amp whinney partners 
take home roughly 65 percent of profits earned jointly with arthur 
young for the next three years while arthur youngs partners share 
the rest 
bowman said the current newsletter was his second special 
edition the first one coming last may when he broke the story of 
the ernst amp whinneyarthur young merger 
the regular january edition of bowmans had a black space with 
the word censored in the area where the ernst amp young story was

bank of new england corp said friday it expects 
to report a 105 billion loss for 1989 and said it was actively 
pursuing the sale of more than 6 billion in assets 
the company new englands secondlargest bank holding company 
after bank of boston corp issued a statement that also said it 
expected to enter a consent order with federal regulators to 
reshape the companys operations 
analysts said a mounting pile of bad real estate loans a 
reflection of the slump throughout the region made bank of new 
england a growing target for a federal takeover 
its like do they survive time said virginia adair a 
banking analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc in new york the 
odds are increasingly slim 
bank of new englands stock tumbled after the companys 
announcement falling 137 to 287 a share in new york stock 
trading it was the days most active stock with 676 million 
shares changing hands 
the company said it expected to report a loss of approximately 
12 billion for the fourth quarter making its annual loss about 
105 billion after boosting its reserves against possible credit 
losses to 165 billion 
the company which has seen its assets shrink in the last 
quarter from around 32 billion to 29 billion said it expected to 
have 225 billion in nonperforming assets mostly troubled real 
estate loans 
standard amp poors said friday it was slightly lowering its 
credit rating for bank of new englands senior and subordinated 
debt certificates of deposit and debt issues supported by letters 
of credit 
the wall street credit rating agency said its action reflected 
the continuing deterioration of bank of new englands loan 
portfolio sampp said the companys reserves appeared adequate to 
cover currently identified problem assets 
earnings prospects however are poor given the high level of 
nonperforming assets and pricing pressure upon the companys 
financing sampp said in a news release with reduced capital 
levels the company has little financial flexibility to address any 
further deterioration in loan quality or any other problems that 
may develop 
the recent real estate slump has hurt many banks but analysts 
said bank of new england was one of the biggest victims because its 
growth was based largely on an aggressive lending strategy during a 
construction boom earlier in the 1980s 
analysts say the bank financed some loans that in retrospect 
look questionable now with the real estate market declining 
developers are having trouble making loan payments 
the bank has come under increased scrutiny by federal 
regulators last month chairman walter connolly said he was 
relinquishing his role as chief executive officer 
bank of new england said friday it expects to enter consent 
orders with the federal reserve board and the federal comptroller 
of the currency dean debuck a spokesman for the comptrollers 
office in washington dc said the order would be issued soon 
although he declined to be specific and said it would outline 
steps the bank has to take to restore its weakened condition 
the order should contain directives to raise more capital and
