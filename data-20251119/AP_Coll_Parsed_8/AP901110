about 100000 nurses have staged a day of strikes 
and protests nationwide demanding an end to low pay long hours 
and overwork that they say causes many to quit after a few years 
the strikes friday were the first in 21 years by the 
170000member japan federation of medical workers unions the 
federation wants more nurses hired at more than 1000 medical 
institutions said spokeswoman seishi katsuragi 
daylong strikes were held friday at 522 private hospitals ms 
katsuragi said 
because strikes are illegal for workers at national 
institutions nurses at the national cancer center research 
institute handed out leaflets and gathered for a rally before work 
hours 
ms katsuragi said the number of nurses employed needs to double 
to about 15 million about the number of registered nurses in the 
country however many prospective nurses refuse to work for the 
low pay 
their starting salary is about 1160 a month they want 1230 
nurses also get bonuses totaling about 4 months pay in two 
installments each year 
now the union federation says most nurses must work late into 
their pregnancies and nearly 70 percent have problematic 
pregnancies as a result 
often two nurses must take care of 50 patients at night 
according to the groups study 
toshihiro kitagawa secretarygeneral of the national medical 
labor union which staged the protest at the national cancer center 
research institute in tokyo said many of the nurses are working 
three hours of overtime daily 
many nurses quit after about three years because they cannot 
take the low pay long hours and hard work said masahiko kodama 
another union leader at the hospital 
hospital management has not made any counteroffers and the 
federation says its members will strike again nov 27 if there is 
no progress in negotiations

shabby writing spurred a judge to order the 
dismissal of more than half the securities fraud charges against 
lincoln savings and loan tycoon charles h keating jr unless 
prosecutors can whip them into shape 
twentytwo of the 42 counts keating faces were flawed superior 
court judge lance ito ruled friday saying 20 of the poorly written 
charges do not mention a crime 
ito gave federal prosecutors until nov 19 to submit a revised 
indictment the next hearing was set for dec 3 
those 20 counts allege defendants keating former lincoln 
presidents ray c fidel and robin s symes and american 
continental president judy j wischer sold junk bonds in ways that 
exceeded authority given them by the state department of 
corporations the department also approved the bond sales 
the law under which the four are charged states only that it is 
against the law to sell bonds without getting department of 
corporations authority since they had it the judge reasoned that 
law could not apply 
another count that ito jeopardized alleges the defendants 
published advertising for a bond sale without properly filing a 
copy of the ad with the state department of corporations the final 
count ito questioned as flawed alleges they lied to the department 
the junk bond sales occurred at branches of lincoln the 
irvinebased thrift whose 2 billion failure may become the 
costliest ever to taxpayers 
the bonds became worthless in spring 1989 when phoenixbased 
american continental filed for bankruptcy protection and regulators 
seized lincoln 
keating spent 33 days in jail until he was allowed to post a 
reduced bond of 300000 last month 
the defendants are accused of deceiving investors about the 
safety of 250 million in the nowworthless bonds many elderly 
buyers lost their life savings 
if convicted the four each could receive maximum 10year prison 
terms 
keating in a phone call from phoenix said he was elated 
friday 
weve said all along that we didnt do anything illegal he 
said 
prosecutors and defense attorneys disagreed over how severe a 
blow the government suffered in its case it is the first criminal 
prosecution stemming from the collapse of lincoln and its parent 
american continental 
i think in this case unfortunately the district attorney cut 
too many corners said abbe lowell who represents wischer if 
they think they can now cut and paste and succeed in doing what 
they did before let them try 
but prosecutors characterized the problems as technical and said 
they believed revised charges would stand deputy district attorney 
william hodgman said he would address some of the judges concerns 
by being more specific about charges probably by adding additional 
counts 
stephen c neal keatings attorney said the defense would 
challenge whatever charges survive on grounds of insufficient 
evidence 
prosecutors must prove that the four defendants are guilty even 
though they did not personally sell any bonds they are being held 
liable for their employees actions 
in a related matter arizona republican john mccain will be the 
first of the keating five senators to state his case when the 
senate ethics committee begins public hearings next week officials 
said 
until now the panel has heard testimony and deliberated in 
secret but beginning thursday it will publicly listen to facts 
and explanations from the five senators who went to bat for 
keatings savings and loan 
mccain will be followed by four democrats sens john glenn of 
ohio donald riegle of michigan dennis deconcini of arizona and 
alan cranston of california

the 74 eddy nadreau took to the homeless 
shelter where he is staying was more than enough motivation to sell 
the daily news despite the pickets who occasionally tried to shout 
him down 
i need food on my table nadreau said estimating more than 
50 men from the atlantic mens shelter in brooklyn had begun 
selling the strikeplagued new york tabloid 
the poor and the homeless became sales people friday as the 
daily news tried to overcome circulation problems caused by the 
2weekold strike 
it was unclear what effect the new work force was having on 
distribution but it was clearly a big boost to the wallets of men 
such as nadreau 
he stood in front of grand central terminal and sold about 150 
newspapers in four hours enough to bring about 74 he said the 
daily news had called the shelter offering 6 an hour and a 
percentage of sales and the word spread 
harassment from union members didnt have much impact when 
compared with an empty stomach he said 
selling papers nearby was 30yearold wayne malone of englewood 
nj wearing a cap that read dont worry be happy 
i dont even know what the strike is about to be honest 
the previously unemployed man said 
three men were trying to sell the daily news across the street 
from radio city music hall in midtown manhattan 
they said on friday morning one of them was attacked by a group 
of about 15 people including five women who scattered about 50 
newspapers 
they grabbed me said clive vernon 23 one guy tried to 
swing at me and missed they wont be back they know were 
swinging back now 
jonathan frazier 26 and greg hamonds 35 who were selling 
papers across the street ran to help and they were also 
confronted 
we told them if they got a beef take it up to the daily 
news frazier said theyve got a right to strike and weve got 
a right to make a living 
mary brosnahan a representative of the coalition for the 
homeless said it is unconscionable to be using the poorest of 
the poor as strikebreakers 
the state assemblys labor committee plans to hold hearings into 
allegations of violence by both sides in the strike committee 
chairman frank barbaro said friday 
those allegations include acts of violence against strikers 
several striking news workers and a new york times driver speaking 
at a news conference held by barbaro said they had been assaulted 
or intimidated by goons and thugs hired by the newspaper 
the news using management employees replacement workers and 
union members willing to cross picket lines has published each day 
of the strike but circulation has been a major problem 
daily news publisher james hoge said this week that 600000 
papers were being printed daily with twothirds finding their way 
to buyers union officials and competitors disputed those figures 
prestrike circulation was about 109 million copies daily 
making the news the nations thirdlargest metropolitan daily 
newspaper

a tv movie that shows an earthquake leveling 
los angeles will make people aware of the potential for disaster 
without dashing hopes for survival the films producer says 
criticism that the big one the great los angeles earthquake 
will unnecessarily frighten people is hogwash said robert m 
sertner coexecutive producer of the miniseries slated for 
broadcast sunday and monday nights on nbc 
our goal is to wake people up especially in other regions 
of the nation that could be hit by strong quakes sertner said 
friday 
scientists and emergency officials have said the film 
exaggerates the death and devastation a big quake would cause in 
los angeles they fear that it may discourage viewers from 
adequately preparing for seismic disaster 
it makes me crazy sertner said of such criticism im not 
pretending this is a documentary but its raising peoples 
consciousness and thats what we wanted to do so its hogwash 
to contend the miniseries will discourage emergency preparations 
i wanted to let people know preparedness makes a difference 
he said noting that the film shows the importance of learning how 
to shut off gas lines and stockpile emergency supplies 
station knbctv in los angeles arranged for local red cross 
chapters to operate earthquake preparedness hotlines 
its possible some people may have a very emotional reaction 
to the miniseries said sylvia stewart spokeswoman for the red 
cross orange county chapter small children may be frightened 
to provide earthquake preparedness brochures to movie viewers 
the american red cross already is operating a 24hour nationwide 
tollfree hotline the number is 800 8422200 
california office of emergency services officials were upset to 
learn the movie depicts the agency trying to stifle an earthquake 
prediction to protect a wealthy developer 
i absolutely feel bad about that but it was done to 
dramatize the dilemma facing officials who must decide whether to 
warn the public based on uncertain earthquake forecasts sertner 
said

veterinarians often are silent on animalrights 
issues but should speak out if they oppose such controversial 
practices as largescale vermin trapping and laboratory 
experiments an animalwelfare official says 
veterinarians have a scientific background so they understand 
the importance of experiments using animals said gus w 
thornton president of the bostonbased massachusetts society for 
the prevention of cruelty to animals 
they also sympathize with some of the groups concerns about 
animals welfare but theyve been hammered so much from both sides 
that theyve learned to keep their opinions to themselves 
thornton said 
thornton spoke at a forum sponsored by the american veterinary 
medical association about 125 veterinarians and animalethics 
experts from the united states england and canada attended 
thornton said if veterinarians consider animal traps or 
experimental conditions to be cruel they should suggest 
alternative humane ways to control pet populations and to 
slaughter animals for food 
but you cant ignore the fact that people are going to eat 
meat and that some rats have to be trapped and killed to prevent 
disease he said some extremist groups will never accept that 
we will not and should not agree with everyone thornton 
added but we must take a stand and provide our expertise 
katherine a houpt a professor at new york state college of 
veterinary medicine said veterinarians should push for more 
funding of behavioral and psychological studies to determine the 
most humane conditions for housing animals 
for example she outlined a study she conducted to test whether 
horses prefer to lie on concrete wood chips or straw 
researchers found that horses opt for wood chips and that the 
animals also like welllighted stalls where they face an aisle 
rather than a wall such stalls allow the horses to see other 
horses better 
that can be kept in mind when designing stalls she said 
it wont make them the easiest to clean but itll certainly be 
more humane 
studies like houpts can pinpoint an animals preferences but 
veterinarians also should remember that people have different 
perceptions of what constitutes animal cruelty another speaker 
said 
you cant measure cruelty like you measure an animals weight 
and size its an ethical judgment said jerrold tannenbaum a 
clinical assistant professor at tufts universitys school of 
veterinary medicine in grafton mass 
one investigator might think that what we owe animals is an 
absence of suffering while another thinks that what we owe animals 
is a state of complete mental and physical health said 
tannenbaum those arent the same things

while some american gis still 
dont have tents to sleep in they back president bushs decision 
to give operation desert shield enough muscle to attack the iraqis 
but some troops have reservations about war 
militarily speaking hes absolutely right air force capt 
patrick ryan 28 of new orleans said friday as he waited for a 
flight at an air base in eastern saudi arabia 
i dont think we have to worry much about the iraqis launching 
an offensive any more the big thing right now is how to get those 
guys out of kuwait and to launch an offensive its going to take 
quite a lot of firepower said the panamabased fighter pilot 
like many servicemen here ryan said he hoped iraqi president 
saddam hussein would pull his troops out of kuwait but he said the 
usled forces must be prepared if he refuses 
many of the untested young soldiers are looking for a fight 
we just want to go in and clean house and go home said 
airman mike beam 22 of houston with the 401st supply squadron 
all of us dont want this to be another vietnam war do it once 
take them out and just make iraq a big parking lot 
combat veterans say they hope for peace 
after 30 years in the marines and two tours in vietnam brig 
gen mike myatt commander of the 30000member marine ground force 
in northeastern saudi arabia said he hopes his men will leave the 
desert without firing a shot 
nobody whos been in combat ever wants to go back into combat 
but they know that if we have to we have to be ready said 
myatt 49 
marine staff sgt arthur allen spoke for other soldiers who 
wont state their views publicly when he said i didnt think 
there ever was a significant threat to saudi arabia or the oil 
supply to the west 
we should never have been sent allen said friday at 
torrejon air force base in spain en route back to the united 
states 
however he said the united states cannot leave now until saddam 
is diposed of otherwise if we leave hell run back in his cave 
and come out 10 times stronger 
bush on thursday ordered about 200000 additional troops to the 
persian gulf to join the 230000 us military personnel who have 
been defending saudi arabia against an iraqi attack allies from 26 
countries have sent 100000 soldiers to the multinational force 
assembled in the area 
the president said he wanted the the allied forces to have an 
adequate offensive military option should global sanctions fail 
to convince iraqi president saddam hussein to withdraw from kuwait 
iraq has deployed an estimated 430000 troops in kuwait and 
southern iraq since it invaded the oilrich emirate aug 2 
a ranking us military official in saudi arabia speaking on 
condition he not be identified said if there was a doubt in 
saddam husseins mind about us resolve to use any option 
required if it comes to that this should pretty well clear it 
up 
army maj frank irons a logistics expert on the staff of desert 
shield commander gen norman schwarzkopf said he thought more 
troops would limit casualties in the event of war 
i would think the more people the more firepower we get in 
here would enhance our chances if we were to go on the offensive 
to do a quicker job therefore saving a lot of people and limiting 
the casualties that we would probably have said irons 40 of 
knoxville tenn 
army medical supply officer tony turner 39 of fayetteville 
nc who was heading home to retire backed bush for preparing for 
war which he said is the only option 
i think that should have been done all along its just 
they keep bringing more and more people over with no room to put 
them and they have to wind up sleeping out in the open but i 
guess its something that they have to do he said 
news of the new mobilization was just filtering out to the 
troops in the field on friday the main airbase was operating 
normally with no new arrivals among the supply flights on the 
runway 
at the armys 530th supply and services battalion headquarters 
which provides logistics support for thousands of soldiers there 
was some concern in the laundry and bakery about the mobilization 
the only thing im worried about is having to make more 
bread said spec norman wiemken 22 of polo ill who was 
baking some of the 3000 loaves of bread produced there daily 
just more laundry laughed pvt 1 lawandra hinton 20 of 
newport news va who was sorting through some of the 12000 
pieces of clothing washed there every day

fallen junk bond king michael milken received 
millions more than disclosed from private partnerships set up by 
the nowbankrupt securities firm drexel burnham lambert inc a 
newspaper reported today 
the partnerships benefited from investment opportunities made 
available to no one else and were not disclosed publicly the los 
angeles times reported 
a source with access to partnership information was quoted in 
the times as saying a 1 billion estimate of milkens gross 
receipts from the investments is a conservative figure 
i think youre extremely safe if you estimate a billion 
dollars as weird as that number sounds the unidentified 
source told the times 
another unnamed source estimates the value of assets remaining 
in the partnerships is between 500 million and 600 million 
reflecting the sharp drop in junk bond worth 
milken spokesman ken lerer said friday the figures were 
incorrect 
the information you gave me is patently false and riddled with 
misinformation designed to hurt michael milken and his family on 
the eve of his sentencing lerer said its irresponsible of 
the los angeles times to allow itself to be used in this fashion 
records obtained by the times for 12 of the nearly 200 
partnerships in which milken and family members are known to have 
held an interest show milken received at least 470 million from 
1981 to 1988 
milken who headed drexels beverly hillsbased junk bond 
department resigned in june 1989 drexel went into bankruptcy 
proceedings in february 1990 
milken pleaded guilty in april to six felony counts of 
conspiracy aiding and abetting the filing of a false statement 
with the securities and exchange commission securities fraud 
aiding and abetting net capital violations mail fraud and 
assisting the filing of a false tax return 
milken agreed to pay 600 million in penalties and faces up to 
28 years in prison sentencing is scheduled for next week 
federal prosecutors revealed that milken received direct 
compensation from drexel of 11 billion in 198487 including 550 
million in one year 
documents obtained by the times include a study done by the 
general accounting office at the behest of a house subcommittee it 
lists 30 partnerships with total estimated payouts of 204 billion 
to all partners from 198189

shiite moslem militias began pulling out 
of the city this morning in line with a 10day deadline set by the 
government for creation of a militiafree capital 
the government of president elias hrawi is trying to take 
control of the entire capital as part of a plan to end 15 years of 
civil war that has killed more than 150000 christians and moslems 
the syrians the main powerbrokers in lebanon have 40000 
troops in the country and have pledged hrawi all the backing he 
needs to implement the peace plan 
this morning the syrianbacked mainstream amal militia withdrew 
about 200 fighters from its stronghold in the south beirut slum of 
chiyah 
amal fighters in 16 trucks and jeeps armed with twinbarreled 
antiaircraft guns recoilless cannons and machine guns gathered 
near the militias headquarters on the beirut airport highway 
the mostly bearded amal fighters armed with sovietdesigned 
ak47 assault rifles and rocketpropelled grenade launchers smiled 
and made vforvictory signs with their fingers as the convoy drove 
to the militias canton in south lebanon 
these are our regular fulltime fighters most of them come 
from villages outside beirut said an amal commander who 
identified himself only by the code name of abu aly 
abu aly dressed in camouflagedesigned fatigues and armed with 
a 38caliber revolver said the militia pulled out overnight our 
heavy medium and light weapons 
parttime fighters who have homes in beirut would remain as 
unarmed civilians he said 
he said the militia leader nabih berri had ordered all our 
forces in beirut to withdraw in line with the government plans to 
create the greater beirut 
a police spokesman said the other shiite militia the 
iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god pulled out overnight 
several militiamen from its south beirut strongholds of hay 
mady bir abed and mouawad where most of the 13 westerners missing 
in lebanon were believed held 
the spokesman who cannot be named in line with regulations 
said the hezbollah militiamen left in vans that drove before 
daybreak to the eastern bekaa valley where the proiranian militia 
maintains bases 
we have no estimate of the hezbollah militiamen who have 
already pulled out of south beirut the spokesman said 
the conservative newspaper addiyar in an unattributed report 
said kidnappers of western hostages moved the captives out of 
south beirut to unknown hideouts two weeks ago 
the move by the kidnappers was prompted by the governments 
determination to create a militiafree capital covering beirut and 
its environs the paper said without further elaboration on the 
remark 
earlier reports said the hostages were moved prior to the oct 
13 crushing of rebel gen michel aoun by syrian and lebanese army 
forces 
the 13 westerners missing in lebanon are six americans four 
britons two germans and an italian most of them are believed held 
by proiranian fundamentalists shiite factions affiliated with 
hezbollah 
the longestheld is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press who was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
the police spokesman said the rightistchristian lebanese forces 
militia of samir geagea also was gathering its fighters in east 
beiruts districts of ashrafiyeh nabaa and karantina for the 
pullout from the greater beirut 
the lebanese forces militiamen would go to the christian 
hinterland of kesrouan province north of the capital the spokesman 
said 
hrawi is trying to rebuild the lebanese army for years 
fractured along sectarian lines at present military sources said 
he has an effective combat force of only about 9000 moslem troops 
under his army commander gen emile lahoud 
 
until he can reunify the army which had a nominal overall 
strength of about 42000 hrawi will be dependent on the syrians 
for his military muscle 
a peace plan approved by lebanons parliament in october last 
year aims to give equal political power to christians and moslems 
that would effectively shift power to the moslem majority

martin luther king jr plagiarized 
frequently in a college dissertation but his standing as a giant 
in the civil rights movement will not be diminished a history 
professor and other supporters say 
stanford university professor clayborne carson said friday the 
apparent 1950s graduate school plagiarism was a small blot on the 
record of a great man 
kings historical importance was based not on his work as a 
student but on his achievements as a leader of a social movement 
that changed the course of american history said carson whose 
king familysupported project revealed the copied work that 
cant be taken away 
boston university where king went to graduate school set up a 
committee of four scholars to review kings 343page dissertation 
a comparison of the conceptions of god in the thinking of paul 
tillich and henry nelson weiman which he wrote in 1955 
school officials made it clear that even if evidence shows king 
liberally borrowed from another students papers without adequate 
citations as claimed the civil rights leaders legacy wont be 
destroyed 
the stature of martin luther king jr as the preeminent 
leader of americas civil rights movement does not depend upon the 
truth or falsity of the charges now being raised the university 
said in a prepared statement 
his great and lasting contributions to american society and 
to humanity rest upon the life he made after he left the 
university 
coretta scott king didnt immediately comment but carson said 
kings widow was comfortable with the idea that his research 
revealed the borrowed ideas and passages 
she founded the martin luther king jr papers project in 1984 to 
gather his papers from locations around the country and produce a 
multivolume collection carson was picked to direct the project 
which he said is now 16 months behind schedule because the past 
three years have been devoted to substantiating the plagiarism 
ralph luker associate editor of the project said the group 
will insert all footnotes in kings works where they quote others 
material and write a separate paper explaining the original 
omissions a plan approved by coretta scott king 
the questions about kings academic work surfaced in late 1987 
when evidence was discovered by a stanford graduate student working 
for the king papers project 
in some parts of the dissertation king lifted passages nearly 
verbatim from other texts without using any quotation marks or 
footnotes 
the wall street journal reported friday the discovery was kept 
secret for three years as it stirred much debate and anguish 
several students working on the project wondered why the finding 
should be investigated some resigned and at least one broke down 
in tears when she found out 
king who won the nobel peace prize in 1964 was assassinated at 
age 39 on april 4 1968 in memphis tenn

in one of the mostviolent 
antigovernment clashes in months former contra rebels attacked a 
police station leaving three guerrillas dead and 35 people 
wounded a cabinet official said 
the attack on the police station followed a week of protests in 
eastern nicaragua over the economic policies of president violeta 
chamorro and the continued highprofile role of leftist sandinistas 
in her government 
the former rebels are also demanding that mrs chamorro deliver 
the resettlement aid she promised to demobilized contras who waged 
a nearly 10year guerrilla war with us backing against the 
sandinistas 
the contras were officially disarmed over the summer after the 
sandinistas handed the government to mrs chamorros coalition on 
april 25 there had been few reports since of gunplay by the former 
rebels 
interior minister carlos hurtado said nine of the wounded in 
fridays attack were police officers in nueva guinea a small town 
about 190 miles southeast of managua identities of the other 
wounded were not immediately known 
in the predawn attack the attackers fired ak47 assault rifles 
at the station then fled to a nearby church where they 
surrendered hurtado said he said a commission made up of roman 
catholic and protestant church representatives and officials of the 
organization of american states mediated the surrender twentyone 
people were arrested 
hurtado said the attack was not linked with the movement of 
town mayors 
more than a dozen mayors in eastern towns have formed a civic 
committee for the defense of democracy they support the protests 
of the former contras and are demanding the sandinistas be stripped 
of their control of security forces 
last week excotras began erecting blockades on the only road 
connecting the southeast with other parts of the country causing 
losses for many farmers 
armed forces chief gen humberto ortega has threatened to use 
the army to clear the rama road but so far the military has taken 
no action 
dissident leaders including more than a dozen town mayors in 
chontales and zelaya provinces are demanding the removal of gen 
ortega a holdover from the sandinista administration and brother

prime minister nawaz sharifs new 
cabinet brings back nearly a dozen veteran politicians with links 
to the late military dictator gen mohammad zia ulhaq 
the 18member cabinet was sworn in friday night by president 
ghulam ishaq khan the ministry portfolios were announced today 
defense was the only portfolio that was not assigned but 
analysts say sharif probably will keep it following the tradition 
of his predecessors 
the new cabinet is dominated by veterans of the muslim league 
the largest of 18 parties in the rightwing islamic democratic 
alliance that swept into power in the oct 24 parliamentary 
elections 
sharif a 41yearold industrialist who launched his political 
career during zias rule was sworn in as prime minister wednesday 
to head the countrys fifth civilian government in 43 years 
sharifs cabinet is one of the smallest especially compared to 
the record 58member cabinet of his predecessor ousted prime 
minister benazir bhutto 
two of the most important portfolios will remain with veteran 
politicians who have links to the zia era they were also members 
of the caretaker government handpicked by the president after he 
dismissed ms bhuttos 20monthold government aug 6 on charges of 
corruption and mismanagement 
sahabzada yaqub khan will remain foreign minister and sartaj 
aziz will stay as finance minister 
political analysts said there was only one surprise in the 
lineup the establishment of a narcotics control ministry rana 
chandar singh a hindu minority member of parliament was appointed 
by sharif to head the ministry 
pakistan is one of the worlds largest heroinproducing 
countries the united states heavily finances its antidrug 
program which several western diplomats have criticized as 
sluggish 
pakistans poppy crops are concentrated in a lawless tribal belt 
in the northwest frontier province bordering afghanistan it is a 
stronghold of traditional orthodox moslems and several pakistani 
observers questioned singhs ability to penetrate the area 
since its creation in the 1947 partition of the indian 
subcontinent pakistan has been ruled by the military for more than 
a quarter century 
zia many of his top generals and us ambassador arnold l 
raphel died in a mysterious plane crash in august 1988 clearing 
the way for pakistans first free elections in more than a decade 
and resulting in ms bhuttos election nov 16 of that year

the government today rejected an iraqi offer to 
trade a captured british airways jumbo jet for engines and spare 
parts 
there is a whole raft of sanctions in place so any trade with 
iraq is out of the question and that includes this suggested 
exchange a british foreign office spokesman said on condition of 
anonymity 
iraqi airways chief nouredine safi was quoted in todays iraqi 
defense ministry newspaper alqadisiya as saying the plane cannot 
leave before engines for iraqi airways planes and other technical 
equipment in britain are returned to us 
the boeing 747 being held was the last plane to land at kuwait 
airport before the iraqi invasion of the emirate on aug 2 
many of the estimated 350 passengers found themselves caught up 
in the crisis and held captive as human shields to deter an 
attack by usled forces british airways says 162 passengers and 
crew members who landed in kuwait are still being held in iraq and 
kuwait 
british airways described the offer by the iraqi airways chief 
as bizarre 
obviously there can be no negotiations as long as sanctions 
are in place an airline spokesman said in our view there 
could be no deal that did not include the release of our 
passengers crew and staff 
britain observes the united nations trade embargo against iraq 
that was imposed after the invasion

babe when it came to pictures of sonny bono so palm springs and 
its mayor decided to accommodate them 
to satisfy the cravings of tourists who want to have their photo 
taken with bono the council voted this week to spend 1550 to 
create four lifesize standup photos of the mayor 
bono 55 who rose to fame with his thenwife cher in the 
1960s as half of the pop singing duo sonny and cher agreed as long

you can eat for free at the happy house of 
pizza but first you have to understand that some pies are round 
and some pis r squared 
back to school with a free large cheese pizza for the correct 
answer reads the flier happy house of pizza began mailing to 
annapolisarea households in september if a 15inch pizza costs 
875 how much should a 16inch happy house pizza pie cost 
owner ryan belen said he came up with the promotion to prove how 
much bigger his pizzas are than those of a nearby dominos outlet 
both restaurants sell a large cheese pizza for 875 
most happy house customers come up with the halfbaked answer of 
933 by incorrectly applying the ratio 15to16 to the price he 
said 
the actual solution lies in finding the area of each pie using 
the formula for deriving the area of a circle pi times the radius 
squared the ratio of the two areas is then used to find what the 
price would be if happy house charged accordingly 
the larger pie gives roughly 25 square inches more pizza and 
would cost 996 if happy house charged the same amount per square 
inch as dominos 
pi the 16th letter of the greek alphabet is the mathematical 
term for the ratio between the circumference of a circle and its 
diameter which is always approximately 314159265 the letter 
r is the math symbol for radius 
nine out of 10 customers come up with the wrong answer but 
happy house has given away 86 pizzas belen said 
many students and even some teachers have come up with the wrong 
answer but all love the promotion he said 
one teacher called long distance from the eastern shore to say 
she heard about it he said she said she was going to put the 
problem on the blackboard and buy her students pizza if they got it 
right

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
wrapped up a twoday visit to germany today after discussing the 
persian gulf crisis with german leaders and appealing for financial 
aid for his countrys crippled economy 
the kremlin leader held separate talks today with foreign 
minister hansdietrich genscher and with social democratic party 
chief hansjochen vogel 
vogel said later gorbachev insisted that all means must be 
exhausted to reach a peaceful solution to the gulf crisis 
sparked by iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
asked what gorbachev said about military intervention vogel 
told reporters he did not rule that out 
genscher meanwhile urged all western nations to be ready to 
aid the soviet union financially and preserve its stability 
stability in the soviet union is important for stability in 
all of europe and therefore deserves our support he told 
deutsche welle radio after meeting with the soviet leader 
gorbachev had been scheduled to meet today with former west 
german chancellor willy brandt who returned friday night after a 
hostagerelease mission to iraq but brandt cancelled the meeting 
saying he was too tired 
the soviet president ended his stay with a trip to speyer 
famous for its majestic 11thcentury cathedral a stop at a 
winemaking village and a private visit to the home of chancellor 
helmut kohl 
in speyer more than 5000 germans welcomed gorbachev hailing 
him for helping reunite germany several people held up signs 
lettered in russian saying thank you gorby and we wish you 
happiness mikhail 
on friday kohl and gorbachev signed a nonaggression treaty 
that lays the foundations for expanded economic cultural 
technological and political relations between the two nations 
speaking at a state dinner in his honor friday night gorbachev 
made a strong appeal that the germans be generous with financial 
aid badly needed to rescue his nation from economic collapse 
from you we would like courage generosity and a healthy 
readiness for risk he said 
kohl responded positively but without being specific 
in view of the painful but unavoidable transition we are 
prepared with words and deed to help further said kohl 
under gorbachev the soviet union is moving toward a market 
economy following decades of communist central planning the 
economy is plagued by shortages and low production 
after the state dinner the head of daimlerbenz germanys 
largest company said emergency deliveries of food and clothing to 
the soviet union might be needed this winter 
everyone is awaiting a very difficult terrible and hard 
winter daimlerbenz chief edzard reuter said of the situation in 
the soviet union there must be immediate help 
such aid would likely include necessary items such as 
clothing food we all must jointly organize that said the 
head of the auto and electronics giant 
earlier in the evening german economics minister helmut 
haussmann told his soviet counterpart stepan sitarjan that bonn 
is willing to help the soviet union increase its natural gas 
exports through improved technology germany is a major customer of 
soviet natural gas 
haussmann also said german banks are interested in helping 
soviet foreign trade organizations that are behind on their 
payments to german firms 
kohl has said repeatedly he wants to help gorbachev overcome the 
soviet unions enormous problems partly in gratitude to gorbachev 
for letting the berlin wall fall and partly out of worry about 
soviet stability 
gorbachevs visit came exactly one year after east german 
officials opened up the wall spurring the revolution that ended 
communist rule and led to reunification on oct 3 
in the treaty initialed in moscow on sept 13 both nations 
pledged not to attack the other and to honor the borders of all 
european nations 
after a shortlived alliance nazi germany attacked the soviet 
union at the start of world war ii about 26 million soviets were 
killed

opponents of mayorelect vincent a 
buddy cianci jr say his political comeback shouldnt count 
because of his conviction six years ago for attacking a man he 
thought was involved with his wife 
on friday the state board of elections said a recount 
determined cianci a republican defeted independent candidate 
frederick lippitt by 248 votes in tuesdays mayoral election 
three providence voters who say they arent connected to lippitt 
filed a challenge stating that a 1986 amendment to the state 
constitution bars cianci from taking office the law states that a 
convicted felon is not eligible to hold political office until 
three years after his sentence and probation have been served 
cianci pleaded no contest on april 24 1984 to assaulting a man 
he thought was having an affair with his estranged wife his wife 
testified that cianci went after the man with a fireplace log a 
lit cigarette and an ashtray in rhode island a nocontest plea is 
recorded as a conviction 
cianci 49 received a fiveyear suspended sentence but the 
felony forced him from office he went on to become a popular radio 
talk show host 
cianci said his campaign researched the constitutional amendment 
and concluded that it couldnt be applied to him because his 
conviction came before the amendment was adopted 
the people have spoken he said i think the people would 
rise up if anyone tried to steal the election 
the city board of canvassers said it would certify ciancis 
victory on tuesday and take up the voters challenge after that 
ciancis previous 10 years in office were tainted by scandal 
although cianci himself was never accused of any crimes 22 people 
connected to his administration were convicted of various charges 
lippitt 73 declined to congratulate cianci when he conceded 
defeat friday 
not everyone is given a second chance and this time i hope he 
really will be different he said i said during the campaign i 
didnt see this change i didnt say that falsely i meant it

us military spokesman said today 
us air force spokesman capt tom gilroy said americans miles 
hoffman and don and brenda swanke had undergone checkups at the 
us air force regional hospital in wiesbaden shortly after 
arriving in frankfurt late friday 
they are all in good condition gilroy said he declined to 
provide any further details or to speculate on hen the three might 
be released from the hospital 
the three arrived along with more than 170 other former 
hostages most of them germans after former chancellor willy 
brandt traveled to baghdad to intercede with iraqi president saddam 
hussein 
hoffman of columbus ga was working in kuwait with a private 
company when iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 he was shot in the arm

his captivity 
mrs swanke appeared in good health and commented on their 
captivity upon arriving at frankfurt i was worried but i was not

treat or check the conditions of americans held hostage in the 
middle east before they are returned to the united states

released by iraq were greeted today by friends and family the four 
were among those whose freedom was won by brandt and they flew to

secretary of state james a baker iii wound up a 
long diplomatic journey today saying the united states and its 
allies were making preparations to go to war with iraq if its 
forces were not withdrawn from kuwait 
i dont see how the message can be any clearer baker said 
after holding what he described as a very positive and successful 
meeting with president francois mitterrand of france 
we have built a consensus we have increased the pressure on 
saddam hussein baker said in a review of his sevencountry trip 
we have isolated him but we havent yet succeeded in reversing 
his aggression 
as a result baker saidwe must heighten the pressure further 
indeed we have to lay the foundation for the use of force should 
that become necessary clearly one way to do that is to get ready 
militarily 
earlier a senior us official said baker would fly home 
without having run into any opposition to a un resolution to 
authorize force to liberate kuwait from iraqi invaders 
baker at a news conference cited president bushs announcement 
of another buildup of us troops in the persian gulf as evidence 
the united states was getting ready to use force against iraq 
baker said he had taken steps during his trip to sort out 
questions of troop command and how the troops would be supplied 
the stop here was critical us officials had said it was not 
clear whether french troops would go into combat 
baker declined to say directly whether mitterrand and foreign 
minister roland dumas had told him they would fight but he hinted 
as much he said the meetings here were very productive 
we believe we are totally united he said 
as for saddam hussein baker said the intention of the 
antiiraqi coalition was to send a clear and unmistakable signal 
to baghdad that we are serious 
baker said after an 80minute meeting saturday with mitterrand 
at elysee palace that the international consensus against saddam 
hussein is solid and unified and will remain so 
a senior american official a day earlier had expressed doubts 
over frances commitment to the western alliance against iraq 
it is clear that the unprecedented international coalition 
brought together to counter the iraqi invasion of kuwait is solid 
and unified and will remain solid and unified baker said after 
meeting with mitterrand 
the french leader told baker that frances position consists 
of the strict application of the resolutions of the united nations 
security council voted since the beginning of august 
presidential spokesman hubert vedrine said 
baker also met with french foreign minister roland dumas who 
had said friday that the effort of france is real and 
secondlargest after the usa this is very clear between the 
americans and us 
a senior us official had said earlier today that baker was 
winding up his sevennation trip without encountering opposition to 
a united nations resolution to authorize force to liberate kuwait 
none of the leaders with whom baker dealt in the eightday trip 
opposed a resolution backing offensive military action against 
iraq said the official who insisted on anonymity 
a few particularly british prime minister margaret thatcher 
took the position that a new resolution was unnecessary while other 
views ranged from seeking security council action now to letting 
additional time pass to keep pressing for a political solution the 
official said 
baker said friday the administration had not authorized the 
drafting of a resolution but sources at the united nations said 
discussions about a text were under way 
the official said baker had not sought a decision from the 
leaders with whom he met during the trip 
the governments he consulted were britain france the soviet 
union china saudi arabia egypt turkey bahrain and the 
overthrown kuwaiti regime 
bakers meeting with french president francois mitterrand could 
be critical to the bush administrations campaign to prepare the 
american public and the world for war over iraqs occupation of 
kuwait 
mitterrand has tried to convince iraqi president saddam hussein 
to withdraw his forces with the expectation that a reversal of the 
aug 2 invasion could produce negotiations over iraqs territorial 
claims against kuwait and dividends for the palestinians in their 
struggle with israel 
a senior us official told reporters with baker on friday in 
moscow that it was not clear where the french would be if us 
troops in the persian gulf attacked 
meanwhile on friday iraqs governmentrun newspaper said iraq 
and france had conducted secret talks that led to the release of 
more than 300 french hostages from iraq 
the paper aljuminhouriya said the talks between iraqi foreign 
minister tariq aziz and former french foreign minister claude 
cheysson were endorsed by the french government france has denied 
any deals were struck for the hostages 
this is bakers last stop on his journey before his arrival 
french foreign minister roland dumas said the effort by his 
government to reverse iraqs aug 2 invasion was second only to the 
united states 
this is very clear between the americans and us 
baker meets with manfred woerner the secretarygeneral of the 
north atlantic treaty organization before flying home to 
washington to report to president bush

the nations poorest republic of 
macedonia holds its first free elections in four decades on sunday 
the polling is a key test for yugoslavias reformist premier 
ante markovic whose alliance of reformist forces is contesting 
elections for the first time 
opinion polls in macedonia indicate the alliance is in close 
competition with the reformed macedonian communist party together 
they are expected to win an outright majority in the new 
parliament 
a successful showing in the macedonian ballot would 
significantly boost the alliances electoral chances in the 
republics of bosniahercegovina montenegro and serbia which hold 
votes in the coming weeks 
markovics reforms and have been undermined by political 
squabbling and rising ethnic tensions in the six constituent 
republics 
the reforms including sweeping privatization lifting of import 
and foreign investment restrictions and the promotion of free 
enterprise have set him at odds with the hardline communist 
leaders of the largest republic serbia 
the alliance was not formed in time for yugoslavias first 
multiparty elections in 45 years last spring in croatia and 
slovenia in that polling centerright parties ousted the ruling 
communists 
macedonia is a poor mountainous region that borders albania 
greece and bulgaria as well as serbia to the north

of hatteras island early today ripping roofs off homes and downing 
power lines and trees there were no reports of serious injuries 
two people required stitches from cuts suffered in the storm 
said a dare county sheriffs dispatcher who declined to give her 
name 
we definitely found tornado damage in the area of the spencers 
woods community of frisco said wally demaurice of the national 
weather services office in buxton 
the tornado was part of a thunderstorm packing up to 78 mph 
winds and heavy rain when it tore through the approximately 10mile 
stretch from avon south to frisco about 6 am he said 
it would appear that a single thunderstorm formed up and 
spawned a tornado that touched down several times from the frisco 
area south of buxton to avon demaurice said there are 
hundreds of trees down and several automobiles damaged 
including my own 
he said he also saw overturned mobile homes and damaged beach 
homes 
chris schauer of bubbas barbque in avon said the twister took 
off part of his restaurants roof blew out windows and tossed 
cinderblocks and bricks onto a nearby car crushing it 
its a mess schauer said 
betty barnett of the frisco woods campground said camper 
trailers there were blown off their blocks 
authorities were advising travelers to steer clear of the area 
ferry service to the island the only way of reaching the outer 
banks has been temporarily suspended because of the storm said 
tabitha hooper at the hatteras ferry office 
the only road linking hatteras to the mainland via bogue island 
was ripped apart two weeks ago when a dredge broke loose from its 
moorings in a gale and smashed into the bonner bridge severing the 
2mile span 
todays storm system knocked out power to an unknown number of 
residents who got their electricity back only last week officials 
said power outages in the frisco and avon areas are temporary 
the storm has moved about 30 miles out to sea within the hour 
and winds had died down to about 25 mph the weather service said

criticism of mikhail s gorbachev from both 
conservatives and liberals as well as a man shooting off a gun 
gave last weeks revolution day marches in red square the 
appearance of funeral march for perestroika 
the population is losing faith in the reforms and in the 
powers that be two of gorbachevs two senior economic advisers 
wrote in a blockbusting open letter published last week 
despite winning the nobel peace prize last month gorbachev 
appears increasingly isolated in the soviet political middle 
ground since september he has wavered in implementing radical 
economic reform that two months ago he said was urgent 
little work has been done to prepare some of the key reform 
measures wrote economists nikolai petrakov and stanislav shatalin 
they previously had refrained from criticizing their boss 
gorbachevs onagain offagain approach to perestroika as the 
reform is called in russian 
conservatives within the huge communist party and government 
apparatus wary of losing their jobs have closed ranks against 
gorbachevs reform radical historian yuri afanasyev wrote 
wednesday in the moscow weekly currents 
gorbachevs political problems go deeper 
political violence economic crime and the threat of a cold 
hungry winter have driven gorbachevs popularity ratings to an 
alltime low of 21 percent down from 52 percent last december 
thats according to an opinion poll to be released sunday by the 
reformist weekly moscow news 
if there were democratic presidential elections today mikhail 
gorbachev would not win the right to lead the country the 
paper reported quoting a poll by the allunion institute for 
public opinion research 
the paper did not disclose the number of people polled or the 
margin of error but the institute is considered among the most 
reliable in the stilldeveloping field of soviet opinion surveys 
despite his steady slide in the polls gorbachev has managed to 
tighten his hold on power over the past year he has won a new 
fiveyear term as president and changed communist party rules to 
require a full congress rather than a central committee meeting 
to unseat him as party general secretary 
the central committee meets several times a year but the party 
holds a congress about every five years 
the angst of the soviet right and left dimly perceived in the 
west welled to the surface during wednesdays revolution day 
celebrations 
for most of the 73 years of soviet rule the observances had been 
marked by respectful bows to the national leadership 
this year the reverie was broken in part by two shots fired on 
red square plainclothes security men dragged away a man the kgb 
identified as alexander a shmonov 38 from the northern russian 
city of leningrad he was charged with attempting terrorism 
equally ominous was the red square parade organized by the 
moscow communist party organization few of the estimated the 
100000 marchers carried avowedly progorbachev banners and some 
were insulting to the president 
several carried portraits of josef v stalin probably the first 
time the dictators image has been born aloft in red square since 
shortly after his death in 1953 
gorbachev endured the conservative march but he left before a 
considerably smaller demonstration of about 5000 radical reformers 
threaded into red square between rows of police and demanded his 
resignation 
the hardliners and the radicals appeared to have little in 
common other than discontent with the present and the president 
someone is blamed for every defeat we have gorbachev 
scholar nikolai amosov wrote in a widely read article in the 
current literary gazette he gave us freedom but the stores are 
empty 
what is the most important aspect of perestroika for the 
people democracy no a boost in the economy amosov wrote 
the shooting and the hatred exposed in the demonstrations were 
omens the political violence that has erupted around the edges of 
the soviet union could reach the center 
nearly 500 people have died in fighting between the two soviet 
republics of armenia and azerbaijan where rocketpropelled 
grenades and automatic rifles are not uncommon 
equally deadly weapons are beginning to appear on the moscow 
black market the newspaper komsomolskaya pravda reported tuesday 
a situation is quite possible in which people in our endless 
lines start shooting at each other the paper said 
its reporters were able to find a large variety of imported and 
soviet automatic weapons for sale in moscows shadier corners 
 
editors note bryan brumley moscow bureau chief of the 
associated press has covered soviet affairs since 1981

secretary of state james a baker iii seeking backing for 
possible military action against iraq met today with frances 
president and said later the two countries have no serious 
differences on persian gulf policy 
i dont see how the message can be any clearer baker said 
after holding what he described as a very positive and successful 
meeting with french president francois mitterrand 
baker declined to say directly whether mitterrand and foreign 
minister roland dumas had told him the french would join in any 
military action against iraq but he said we believe we are 
totally united on gulf matters 
we must heighten the pressure further he said indeed we 
have to lay the foundation for the use of force should that become 
necessary clearly one way to do that is to get ready 
militarily 
key allies in the antiiraq coalition however talk in 
reluctant terms about using military force 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev in germany met today 
with social democratic party chief hansjochen vogel later vogel 
said gorbachev indicated use of force could not be ruled out but 
that all peaceful means must first be exhausted 
and chinese foreign minister qian qichen today stressed the 
importance of continuing efforts to find a peaceful solution 
i think an issue such as the use of force requires detailed 
consultations qian told reporters in amman jordan where he was 
holding talks 
baker met with both qian and gorbachev in the course of his 
trip 
the bakermitterrand meeting came a day after a senior us 
official said it was unclear whether france would support military 
action against iraq if it refuses to withdraw from kuwait which it 
invaded aug 2 
it also came a day after an iraqi state newspaper reported that 
paris had backed secret talks between iraq and a former french 
official talks that led to the release of french hostages 
three american hostages reached freedom friday flying to 
germany along with 171 other westerners whose release was 
negotiated by willy brandt the former west german chancellor 
good riddance said one of the americans miles hoffman 
checking in at the boarding counter in baghdad 
a us military spokesman in germany said the three are in good 
physical condition but declined to provide details or say when 
they might be released from a military hospital in wiesbaden 
there had been doubt about where france would stand if it came 
to war the us official said friday that although troops from 
saudi arabia egypt and arab gulf states would fight alongside us 
forces frances participation as well as that of syria was 
uncertain 
but after talks today with both mitterrand and foreign minister 
roland dumas baker said there were no serious differences 
between washington and paris 
i have no doubt about the unity of the coalition facing 
iraq he said adding that those governments feel the option of 
force can simply not be ruled out 
the coalition against saddam is solid and unified and will 
remain solid and unified he said 
iraqs aljumhouriya newspaper reported friday that iraqi 
foreign minister tariq aziz and former french foreign minister 
claude cheysson met for secret talks endorsed by france 
the dailydid not say when or where the meeting between aziz and 
cheysson took place arab sources said the talks set up by the 
palestine liberation organization took place in tunis late last 
month one week before saddam said french nationals were free to 
go 
more than 300 french citizens later left iraq france has 
repeatedly said it made no deal 
the government did not however deny that the talks took place 
the release of the french nationals was interpreted by many 
western officials as an effort by iraq to divide opposition to its 
occupation of kuwait 
in frankfurt the airport rang out with cheers as the german 
jetliner with 174 freed captives touched down friday 
no reason was given for the release of the three americans among 
the other captives about 1000 americans are still held 
hoffman 33 of columbus ga was shot in the arm on sept 5 by 
iraqi forces in kuwait upon arrival in frankfurt he was 
immediately taken to the us air force regional hospital in 
wiesbaden for a checkup 
also freed were don swanke 66 of westlake village calif and 
his wife brenda swanke lost 33 pounds in captivity 
the three had been held along with hundreds of others as human 
shields at strategic iraqi sites to deter attack 
in another development the british foreign office rejected an 
iraqi offer to trade a captured british airways jumbo jet for 
engines and spare parts saying trade with iraq was out of the 
question

a soviet newspaper on saturday questioned the 
value of continued military and economic aid to cuba the latest 
open criticism of ties fidel castros communist state 
how many more years is the soviet government going to take 
away the rations of povertystricken peasants in order to 
underwrite and maintain the inefficient militarized economy of 
this faroff overseas state asked the commentator alexander 
oskin in the labor newspaper rabochaya tribuna 
citing the cuban debt to the soviet union from 267 billion to 
30 billion the commentator demanded to know how much 30 years of 
support for cuba has cost the average soviet worker and exactly how 
much the kremlin gives in military aid 
oskin suggested that sovietcuban economic relations be 
deideologized and that negotiations be started between the 
united states cuba and the soviet union to destroy another 
bulwark of the cold war 
the commentary taking two fulllength columns inside the paper 
was the latest in a series of attacks on cubansoviet ties that 
some experts believe may be intended to set the stage for a shift 
in soviet policy 
the liberal newspaper komsomolskaya pravda last month published 
reports castro the cuban president lives a lavish personal life 
while employing thousands of body guards to protect him 
in reaction the communist party newspaper pravda quoted 
officials defending sovietcuban ties and published a letter by the 
cuban ambassador to the kremlin criticizing the expose on castro 
cuba under castro has remained committed to hardline communism 
despite the fiveyear soviet reform campaign and toppling of 
hardline governments in most east european countries

bernie sanders socialist is coming to 
congress so is paul wellstone a jesse jacksonstyle democrat who 
demonstrates on behalf of striking meatpackers and farmers facing 
foreclosure 
theyre among the new faces in the capitol corridors likely to 
give the 102nd congress a more liberal tilt than those of recent 
years 
even some of the newly elected republicans appear more moderate 
than some of the people theyre replacing 
we probably have the most liberal congress theres been in 20 
years says allan lichtman a professor of history at american 
university he predicted the new house and senate will be more 
hostile toward president bushs policies 
its not a brand new mandate to recreate the great society 
but i think we have a clearly liberal congress that in particular 
will make it impossible for any conservative initiatives to get 
through lichtman said 
its more and more liberal and the agenda is going to get 
more polarized said ed rollins the chief house gop political 
operative 
house speaker thomas foley dwash already has vowed to renew 
the debate over the civil rights bill bush vetoed this year and to 
pursue new initiatives in health care he also has hinted at a 
democratic attempt to pass a surtax on millionaires 
last weeks elections will give democrats a 268167 edge in the 
house a nineseat increase and a 5644 majority in the senate a 
oneseat gain 
but the numbers dont tell the full story several of the 
newcomers are unabashed liberals of a stripe not seen lately on 
capitol hill 
sanders who uses populist rhetoric to push for taxes on the 
rich and corporations and for national health care is the leader 
of a band of vermont independents known locally as 
sandernistas 
in his campaign against gop rep peter smith sanders ran hard 
against the congress he will join calling it hopelessly and 
pathetically out of touch with the needs of ordinary americans 
after gaining election he said he was proud that vermonters had 
the courage to stand up to the multinational corporations 
near sanders on the ideological spectrum is the only outsider to 
win a senate seat paul wellstone the carleton college professor 
whose firebrand rhetoric and vigorous campaign ambushed gop sen 
rudy boschwitz in minnesota 
wellstone 46 was state cochairman of jesse jacksons 1988 
presidential campaign and has been a grassroots organizer for 
liberal causes 
among other certifiable liberals elected tuesday are maxine 
waters an activist for black and womens causes who will succeed 
retiring california democrat gus hawkins rosa delauro whose 
credentials include a crusade against us support for nicaraguas 
contra rebels in connecticut and neil abercrombie who reclaimed 
a hawaii house seat for the democrats 
abercrombie with his long hair and beard looks like a holdover 
from the 1960s when he was a radical activist he has worked as a 
preschool custodian a probation officer and a college teaching 
assistant and was briefly a member of the house in 1986 after 
winning a special election to fill a vacancy 
once he recalled he was presiding over the house and called 
upon conservative rep newt gingrich of georgia to speak with the 
words ah here comes mr gingrich once again to take up where he 
left off yesterday in flailing the liberal democratic conspiracy 
gingrich will be back after a close brush with defeat but one 
of his colleagues in the conservative opportunity society chuck 
douglas of new hampshire lost in his bid for a new term 
in at least one district where the republicans captured a 
previously democratic seat the change also is toward the left the 
maryland eastern shore slot wrested by schoolteacher wayne 
gilchrest from incumbent roy dyson 
gilchrest is more liberal than dyson on issues like gun control 
the environment abortion and campaign finance reform a shy 
reflective man who speaks of the countrys need for moral 
commitment by its leaders he seems unlike most other politicians 
four years ago he abruptly quit his job took his three 
children out of school and went to spend six months in a cabin in 
wyomings tetons and after losing to dyson in 1988 he spent a 
year painting houses and doing odd jobs before resuming his 
teaching position 
while most of the movement in the new class of 1990 is toward 
the left at least one of capitol hills most liberal groups the 
congressional black caucus will welcome a new member with 
staunchly conservative views 
gary franks a black alderman from waterbury conn won 
election as a fiscal conservative and an opponent of the 1990 civil 
rights bill a 37yearold real estate developer franks is a yale 
graduate who worked for two fortune 500 companies before starting 
his own business he is the first black republican elected to the 
house since 1932 
and a veteran liberal wisconsin democrat robert kastenmeier 
was ousted by a political novice who ran a populist 
antiwashington campaign the victor was scott klug a 37yearold 
former television anchorman who last ventured into politics to run 
for student council in high school

this disillusioned young democracy lurches 
into a benchmark national election sunday after a bloodstained 
campaign waged in a crisis atmosphere 
emotions ran the gamut from weary cynicism to quiet despair as 
guatemalans prepared to elect a new president a vice president 
116 congressmen 300 mayors and 20 delegates to a new central 
american parliament 
street crime and human rights abuses are rampant the economy is 
in shambles the immense power of the army and a wealthy elite is 
uncurbed the government is broke and corrupt 
after only five years of democracy guatemalans are so fed up 
that some polls show a majority want to return to military rule 
while coup rumors flourish democracy remains an alien weed 
without firm roots 
whoever wins will have to prove democracy is really better 
than what we had before said edmund mulet an opposition 
congressman its going to be the last chance we have 
a dozen candidates most conservatives and many with ties to 
past military dictatorships are vying for president none is 
expected to get the 50percentplusone needed to win outright 
electioneve polls taking into account voters options of 
spoiling their ballots or casting blank ones as a sign of 
nonconformity showed null and nobody had as much support 
as anyone 
the polls said newspaper publisher jorge carpio nicolle 58 
would probably garner enough votes to go to a jan 6 runoff with 
former guatemala city mayor alvaro arzu irigoyen 44 or engineer 
jorge serrano elias 45 
both carpio and serrano were candidates in 1985 serrano came in 
third and carpio lost the runoff to president vinicio cerezo 
whoever wins will make guatemalan history jan 14 the first 
time an elected civilian will get a chance to pass the presidential 
sash to another elected civilian 
but some see that scenario as a hollow victory for democracy 
guatemala is still a nomans land a land of impunity death 
and desolation journalist byron barrera said in an open letter 
to the army after he was shot and his wife was killed in a daylight 
ambush last month 
at the end of october the governments human rights ombudsman 
had logged 264 extrajudicial executions and 176 
disappearances the dead include a congressman mayoral candidates 
and party officials 
as guatemala prepares for presidential elections the 
nation is in the grip of the worst human rights crisis since the 
military turned the government over to civilians in 1986 the 
us monitoring group americas watch said in a report released this 
week 
even more pressing for most people are pocketbook issues and 
common crime the candidates are full of vague promises to slash 
inflation and bring law and order 
most espouse some sort of trickledown economics they do not 
speak of the roots of the poverty and violence that bedevil 
guatemala 
none of them are attacking the real issues what to do about 
the army what to do about the private sector said richard 
millet a us expert on latin american military institutions in 
guatemala 
guatemala is a sharply divided nation half its people are 
indians many do not speak spanish more than 70 percent of the 
population lives in extreme poverty more than half cannot read or 
write 
a small elite controls most of the wealth it enjoys one of the 
lowest tax burdens in the hemisphere and one of the biggest slices 
90 percent of the gross national product 
if you want to win an election you cant confront the army or 
the business community said rep mulet chairman of the defense 
committee 
the campaign has done little to enhance democracys image 
its a superficial campaign a campaign of slogans the 
candidates are afraid to touch on the real issues said another 
prominent opposition congressman jorge skinner klee 
trustworthy estimates on voter turout are not available but 
many observers expect it to be relatively low 
one of the early signs of the crisis atmosphere was the 
candidacy of a former dictator retired gen efrain rios montt now 
an evangelical lay preacher was leading in the polls when he was 
ruled ineligible to run 
rios montt who presided over some of the worst human rights 
violations of the armys scorchedearth campaign in the early 
1980s told voters to deface their ballots to signal contempt for 
an electoral process that excluded him 
at the other end of the political spectrum a small stubborn 
band of leftist rebels at war since a ussponsored coup deposed a 
liberal president in 1954 urged people not to vote at all 
the united states which has poured nearly 1 billion into 
guatemala since 1985 in hopes of creating a central american 
showcase for democracy is bitterly disappointed 
we expected a lot more for our money said one us official 
here 
much of the blame is put on guatemalas playboy president a 
christian democrat who weathered several coup attempts 
his administrations record of corruption economic 
mismanagement and failure to act on human rights put his party the 
biggest and best organized in guatemala far down in the polls 
its presidential candidate alfonso cabrera one of cerezos 
closest friends spent the final days of the campaign being treated 
for pancreatic disease at a houston hospital

moslem guerrillas fighting to topple 
the leadership of afghanistan slaughtered more than 200 government 
soldiers who had agreed to surrender diplomatic and guerrilla 
sources said saturday 
the killings occurred last month during battles for two 
provincial capitals in southern afghanistan the sources said on 
condition of anonymity 
moderate guerrillas blamed moslem fundamentalists for the 
massacres moderate groups have pulled out of the fighting aimed 
at pressuring the kabul government to negotiate an end to the 
12yearold war the sources said 
everyone is denying responsibility one diplomatic source 
said 
guerrillas gunned down at least 95 afghan soldiers who had 
surrendered and paved the way for the oct 4 fall of tarin kot the 
capital of uruzgan province sources said 
about two weeks later they said about 125 soldiers were slain 
by guerrillas negotiating the surrender of qalat capital of 
neighboring zabul province the guerrillas had promised the 
soldiers safe passage if they defected they said 
another 100 soldiers were holed up in a heavily armed fort 
overlooking the deserted city until 400 troops were flown in by the 
sovietbacked kabul government along with food and other supplies 
they said 
the reinforcements allowed the government to hold qalat which 
sources said was on the verge of falling to the usfinanced 
guerrillas 
qalat is strategically important to the kabul government because 
of a highway that links eight provincial capitals it is the major 
route for resupply convoys 
shortly before the soviet union ended nine years of direct 
involvement in afghanistan and withdrew its soldiers in february 
1989 many expected that huge defections among government troops 
would bring down the kabul government within months but their 
predictions proved wrong largely because of highly publicized 
massacres of soldiers who surrendered to the mujahedeen 
in november 1988 about 70 government soldiers were killed 
their bodies cut into pieces and put on display by fundamentalist 
guerrillas near the town of torkham on the border with pakistan 
the guerrillas claimed the soldiers were agents of khad the feared 
afghan secret police 
there have been periodic reports since then of afghan soldiers 
being killed after they agreed to surrender 
the killings in tarin kot and qalat occurred as guerrillas 
launched new attacks to break the 2yearold military stalemate 
while government troops have held kabul and the major cities they 
have yet to recapture much of the countryside controlled by the 
mujahedeen 
both the united states and the soviet union want out of 
afghanistan and are reportedly close to an agreement that would end 
the bloodiest and costliest regional conflict of the 1980s 
but they still differ over what role afghanistans president 
najibullah would play in an interim government 
initially the united states had high hopes for the 
governmentinexile set up in pakistan in 1989 to oversee military 
operations against kabul and to prepare for a transition to 
democratic rule 
but washington was forced to reevaluate its position because of 
infighting among the sevenfaction resistance disagreements with 
pakistan and growing pressure from congress to cut an estimated 
300 million in us aid to the guerrillas 
although at first demanding that najibullah step down the 
united states reportedly has agreed that he can remain as president 
through elections if he surrenders control over the military and 
secret police 
both moscow and najibullah reject the demand and most guerrilla 
groups still insist he must step down beforehand

republican john mckernan pledged four years 
ago not to raise the state income or sales tax if he was elected 
maines governor but he knew better than to renew that promise 
when he ran for reelection this year 
mckernan eked out a victory last week over a tough opponent and 
despite a devastating regional economic decline analysts said it 
was because he made three smart decisions he was specific in his 
first tax pledge he didnt waver from it and he realized voters 
wouldnt believe him if he made it again 
president bush who rejoined the nonewtaxes camp last week 
with the pronouncement that any further tax increases would come 
over my dead veto is taking a different path but some 
political experts in both parties believe hes headed in the wrong 
direction 
voters have seen too many governors and the president himself 
break their promises said democratic pollster mark mellman 
no new taxes is not going to be a line were going to hear 
very much in the future mellman said its basically not 
credible to the public 
flip flop flip said a republican operative who insisted 
on anonymity 
tax hikes played a role last week in the ousting of several 
governors some of them had gone back on antitax pledges others 
were associated with parties or administrations that had raised 
taxes the message seemed clear enough 
yet there also were victorious candidates in each party who had 
avoided blanket notax pledges or even advocated certain tax 
increases 
strategists said these candidates won because they were true to 
themselves and honest with the voters stressing the services the 
taxes would support and touting their own efforts to fight waste 
and abuse 
heres a sampling of the tactics that paid off 
illinois republican jim edgar edged democrat neil hartigan for 
governor in a reversal of the usual party lines edgar said a 
temporary income tax surtax earmarked for education should be 
retained because there was no state money available to offset a 
repeal 
he was deadset to level with people said edgars media 
consultant don sipple sipple said public opinion polls showed 80 
percent of the public didnt believe hartigan would keep his 
promise to end the surcharge 
we turned the tax issue into an education issue and a 
credibility issue both served us well sipple said 
california gop sen pete wilson the victorious gubernatorial 
candidate was another sipple client he did not take any pledge 
on taxes he comes from the school that says never say never 
sipple said being honest worked for both of them he added 
referring to wilson and edgar 
oregon democrat barbara roberts won the governors race even 
though she opposed a successful tax limitation initiative and said 
some taxes had to be raised as secretary of state she had 
developed a performance audit program that helped convince voters 
she would spend their money wisely 
theres a way to inoculate against being called a taxer 
said mellman her pollster if youre out there being a watchdog 
over taxpayer money and people believe that they are going to be a 
whole lot less concerned about your tax votes 
florida many analysts said gop gov bob martinez never 
recovered from his promotion of a controversial services tax after 
saying he wouldnt raise taxes former sen lawton chiles refused 
to rule out new taxes but his longtime reputation as a straight 
shooter apparently meant more to voters 
people are much more interested in the content of a 
candidates character than in their positions on the issues said 
mellman if youre in favor of raising taxes its going to cost 
you with a certain segment of the electorate if you flipflop its 
going to cost you across the board because people will question 
your fundamental values your fundamental character 
many republicans still believe opposition to new taxes remains 
one of their best issues but they say there are ways to make that 
point without a 100percent readmylips nonewtaxes pledge that 
can come flying back as ammunition from an opponent 
gop pollster bill mcinturff said mckernan in maine and fife 
symington in arizona are two examples he said symington made up 10 
points at the end of the race by stressing his opposition to a 6 
billion education initiative that was enough to put him in a 
runoff with democratic gubernatorial candidate terry goddard

it isnt the heavy breathing over salomes 
dance of the seven veils that bothers opera singer michael devlin 
its being upstaged night after night by his ow disembodied head 
its very strange its very strange indeed says devlin 
who plays john the baptist in the washington opera production of 
richard strauss salome and loses his head over a pretty 
woman 
the head of course is fake but a strikingly realistic fake 
it lolls on salomes silver platter eyes rolled back blood oozing 
from beneath its long matted hair with a latex face that looks 
exactly like devlins 
to judge by the gasps from kennedy center audiences the head 
almost steals the show its a big enough star to command a 
personal makeup artist and stagehand 
the head was made from a life mask of devlin a baritone from 
seattle for the original peter hall production of salome at 
the los angeles music center in 1986 
the head was bald when it arrived in washington so wigmaker 
dennis bergevin spent 40 hours handstitching and stapling a 
threefoot mane of human hair and cotton dreadlocks to the skull 
the wig cost about 1000 
before each performance a plastic bladder inside the skull is 
filled with a 37 quart of nextel brand simulated blood a 
urethanebased suspension of red microbeads it is unplugged 
shortly before the head is presented to salome 
as soon as the curtain falls makeup specialist cynthia ludwig 
and the stagehand rush the bloody head to a janitors sink and wash 
it clean with cold water then it is carried downstairs in an 
elevator and put under a hair dryer for two or three hours 
shortly before its next stage appearance the face gets a fresh 
layer of greenish white pancake makeup with dark shadows here and 
there bright red lipstick on the mouth and a coating of glycerine 
to make it look sweaty 
for much of the 90minute opera john the baptist or jokanaan 
the prophets hebrew name sits in a dark cistern where herod has 
imprisoned him he shouts dire warnings to the sinners above and 
emerges briefly to scorn seductive salomes advances 
im sitting down there on a chair singing into a microphone 
and watching conductor gerry schwarz on a little television 
set says devlin and two feet to the right is my head lying 
in a bucket of blood its quite disconcerting 
jokanaan doesnt get the girl and who can blame her after all 
he denounces her as a daughter of sodom and refuses even to 
look at her so she strikes her bargain with herod she dances her 
veils away to total nudity before the leering king and she wins 
jokanaans head on a platter 
after the executioners ax falls in the dungeon devlin sneaks 
to the wings to watch soprano maria ewing who plays salome make 
steamy love to his head she cuddles it nibbles it showers it 
with kisses i will bite it with my teeth as one bites a ripe 
fruit she sings 
jokanaan might be forgiven for asking himself did i say 
something wrong 
devlin has appeared a dozen times or more in this production of 
salome in the past four years but says hes still fascinated 
by his severed head 
after the ax falls he said i always stand offstage and watch 
the rest of the show its never lost its power seeing the 
executioner lift my head out of the cistern its my face its a 
chilling sight

long before president bush 
increased gulf troop strength in the persian gulf and raised 
speculation of war us officers on the front lines were prepared 
to take the offensive 
they say they were thinking about combat before secretary of 
state james a baker iii spoke of a new phase of operations and 
before the chain of command was set if fighting spreads outside of 
saudi arabia 
were ready to fight now were just waiting for somebody to 
tell us which way to go said lt col bill chamberlain 39 
commander of the 218th infantry battalion of the 197th infantry 
brigade which is attached to the 24th mechanized division 
our mission was to defend saudi arabia that hasnt changed 
said chamberlain a fourth generation army career officer but 
weve got to have offensive and defensive capabilities 
but these days with about 230000 us troops and a 
140000member multinational force in saudi arabia political 
leaders are talking more emphatically about going in to drive the 
iraqis out of kuwait 
that could entail hitting strategic targets and supply lines in 
iraq 
bush announced thursday that hes beefing up the us force 
originally deployed to protect saudi arabia and its oil fields 
after iraqi president saddam hussein invaded kuwait aug 2 
the addition of four more armored divisions plus more aircraft 
carrier battle groups and possibly more combat jets could push the 
us force to 430000 troops within weeks american military 
officials said 
bush has insisted on dislodging iraq from the conquered emirate 
by force if necessary to demonstrate that aggression cannot pay 
if the un trade embargo and 10 un security council 
resolutions dont force saddam out bush can play a military card 
that gets stronger by the day 
for the troops hunkered down for the past three months in the 
saudi sands at least half of their training and war games are 
geared for attack 
they practice assaulting bunkers built the way the iraqis build 
them they practice housetohouse fighting the kind of combat 
they would presumably encounter in an assault to liberate kuwait 
city 
they charge their tanks in oldstyle cavalry formations against 
trenches and the type of obstacles they think the iraqis would 
throw in their way 
marines rehearse amphibious assaults in the northern arabian sea 
and maneuver their assault vehicles on a sea of sand once ashore 
supply depots have built up a 45day stockpile of ammunition 
weve always had a combat focus were a fastreaction 
force said col glynn hale 46 commander of the 505th paratroop 
regiment of the armys 82nd airborne division these guys know 
any day we can get thrown into combat 
elements of the 82nd were the first american ground troops to 
feel the deserts blastfurnace heat when they arrived aug 7 
the 30000 marines deployed in the desert and the 10000 more 
primed on assault ships off the arabian peninsula say theyve got 
enough firepower to take on iraqi strongpoints even without 
reinforcements 
offensive operations thats our bread and butter said maj 
john bates 44 executive officer of the 1st battalion 3rd marine 
regiment of the 1st marine expeditionary force 
we defend for only one reason so we can regroup and 
counterattack bates said 
the americans know the iraqis have been girding for war as well 
in kuwait and southern iraq an estimated 430000 soldiers are 
dug in behind layered minefields 15foothigh earthen barricades 
and antitank ditches 
us official have said the iraqis have also filled trenches 
along the kuwaiti coast with oil and flammable liquids that would 
be turned into a wall of fire to block an assault from the sea 
its going to be tough any war is said brig gen tom 
draude 50 assistant division commander of the 1st marines 
expeditionary force it aint all going to be perfect you have 
to be prepared for that 
the air force took an aggressive posture from the start the 
us and multinational forces have a clear advantage in 
topoftheline combat aircraft of about 25to1 over the iraqis 
the respected janes defense weekly has reported 
the us force includes about 20 f117 stealth fighters those 
radarevading warplanes would play a key role in a us offensive 
attacking command and communications centers in addition to key 
military targets in baghdad 
the us navy also has more than 50 warships to control the red 
sea arabian sea and the persian gulf the waters on three sides of 
the arabian peninsula 
theyre ready to attack if the confrontation turns to war said

the cabinet on saturday recommended new measures to 
combat organized crime including stiffer prison terms a witness 
protection program and increased controls over the awarding of 
public contracts 
the reforms were made following a report by premier giulio 
andreotti that indicated a sharp rise in criminal activity by the 
sicilian mafia and crime syndicates in naples and calabria 
the government is also drafting new legislation aimed at making 
it more difficult for crime gangs to export money 
under the proposed measures judges can lengthen prison terms 
for conspiracy drug trafficking and kidnapping if the defendant is 
a member of an organized crime gang penalties for inducing 
children under 14 to commit crimes can also be increased 
also companies bidding for public contracts would have to 
submit to tests to determine whether they have criminal 
connections 
the cabinet presented legislation for a witness protection 
program aimed at convincing more criminals to turn states 
evidence 
crime experts have criticized italy for failing to provide 
adequate guarantees to witnesses and their families 
the measures must be approved by parliament 
the report last month said the number of crimes attributed to 
organized crime rose from 740000 in 1980 to more than 2 million 
last year

a nuclear submarine near the end of a 190 million 
reburbishing will be scrapped because of a tiny crack in its 
reactor system the royal navy announced saturday 
nevertheless the decision to decommission the hms warspite is 
regarded as a costsaving move a naval spokesman said 
there was no point in spending time and effort finishing the 
refit only to scrap her in a few years time said the spokesman 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the spokesman also said the valiant class submarine was being 
decommissioned as part of government defense cuts but he did not 
elaborate 
the crack was found february in the 23yearold vessels reactor 
primary cooling system during the refit at devonport dockyard in 
plymouth about 180 miles southwest of london 
the vessels nuclear fuel will now likely be removed and the 
warspite could remain at devonport for years to allow the 
radioactivity to decay said the spokesman 
warspite becomes the second nuclear submarine to be mothballed 
in plymouth 
in september the churchill class submarine hms conqueror which 
sank the argentine cruiser general belgrano during the falklands 
war was towed into the shipyard

after months of struggling with 
dangerous fuel leaks on two of its three spaceships nasa will try 
to launch the space shuttle atlantis this week with a spy 
satellite 
it will be atlantis first flight since march when it placed 
another spy satellite in orbit it will also be the 37th flight of 
a shuttle and the fifth flight this year 
weve been through a lot of interesting times over the past 
few months to say the least said conrad nagel a nasa official 
in charge of atlantis prelaunch operations now that its here 
its real exciting 
atlantis is scheduled to blast off thursday evening sometime 
between 630 pm and 1030 pm est the exact time will be kept 
secret until nine minutes before liftoff because the pentagon 
mission is classified 
the flight is expected to last about four days during which 
atlantis five astronauts will release a satellite that reportedly 
will spy on iraq experts believe it is either a photographic 
imaging or an eavesdropping spacecraft 
information about the mission will be kept secret as with the 
six previous defense department shuttle flights 
pentagon officials say this should be the last classified 
shuttle flight because of the expense of maintaining secure 
operations two military missions planned for next year have 
unclassified cargoes 
atlantis upcoming mission is four months late 
in june a month after columbia sprang hydrogen leaks nasa 
discovered atlantis also had holes and its july mission was put on 
hold 
atlantis military cargo reportedly was modified for gathering 
information in the persian gulf while the ship was repaired 
atlantis external tank fuel lines and valve seals were 
replaced by late september 
nasa had scheduled the mission for nov 9 after atlantis fuel 
tanks were tested but the air force delayed the flight because of 
satellite problems that were corrected last week 
columbias leaks also have been sealed and it is scheduled to 
make a flight in early december 
the successful mission of space shuttle discovery last month 
with a sun probe was nasas first shuttle trip in nearly six 
months that success lifted spirits throughout the space agency 
nagel said adding that successful flights for atlantis and 
columbia will move everybody up one notch on the morale ladder 
once we seem them flying and have this behind us were going 
to look back and mark this year as one of our tough years for 
the space program nagel said well also say the last part of 
the year we were able to get three flights in three months 
john pike director of the federation of american scientists 
space policy project said launching atlantis and columbia by the 
end of the year will help boost nasas sagging image 
but he said the agency had a long way to go in terms of 
getting back in the saddle 
in addition to tracking hydrogen leaks nasa has spent much of 
the past few months investigating the hubble space telescopes 
flawed mirror which went unnoticed until it was in orbit 
there also have been a series of accidents involving shuttle 
equipment 
the latest mishap occurred wednesday when a technician knocked a 
metal pan from a work platform into the astronomical observatory 
aboard columbia a protective blanket over a star tracker was torn 
but officials said the instrument was not damaged 
even if these two guys lift off by the end of the year all 
theyve demonstrated after a sustained period of grounding is that 
they were able to fly all three in a sudden little spurt

jackson zoo workers are keeping their 
fingers crossed for their precious baby a newborn cheetah 
cub 
the cub little more than a pound of hungry dappled baby fur 
has been in an incubator at the jackson zoo since it was born last 
week after his mother rejected him 
hes called ty the initials for 10 years because thats how 
long weve been exhibiting cheetahs and trying to breed them 
said curator jim schnormeier 
hes a precious baby said zoo director barbara barrett 
two cubs were born to jimba 2 early thursday but tys 
sibling was dead when zoo workers arrived schnormeier said 
the mother rejected ty by putting him outside her box so zoo 
workers took the cub to the zoos animal hospital for 
bottlefeeding and a warm incubator 
thirtysix us zoos have 237 cheetahs and have reported at 
least four births this year cheetah births are rare because the 
wild population is declining which fosters inbreeding and can 
result in genetic defects 
tys father mwemdo was acquired in late 1989 from the 
cincinnati zoo

emperor akihito has long lived in the shadow of his 
father the late emperor hirohito and the memories of japans 
headlong march into the pacific war that hirohitos name evoked 
but as akihito on monday officially inherits the throne left by 
his fathers death many japanese are looking to him as the symbol 
of a new age that of the generation who experienced war as 
children and rebuilt the nation in peace 
akihito was 11 years old at the end of world war ii during 
which japanese militarists urged the nation to battle in the name 
of his father the impact of surrender and reform under the 
guidance of usled occupation forces deeply affected his youth 
before akihito turned 13 hirohito made his historic 
renunciation of imperial divinity 
the occupation troops left japan after seven years in 1952 and 
left behind them a democratic constitution that renounced war and 
defined japans monarchs as symbols not the priestkings of 
bygone days 
that imperial role seems to fit akihito who in one of his first 
duties after assuming the throne upon the death of hirohito in 
january 1989 promised to uphold the constitution along with the 
people 
most grieved by his late majestys passing i have succeeded 
to the imperial throne in accordance with the constitution of 
japan he said shrouded in sorrow and overwhelmed by the 
responsibilities i undertake i stand humble before you 
akihito born on dec 23 1933 bears a strong physical 
resemblance to hirohito and has inherited his fathers short 
almost frail build he also has his fathers passion for science 
and is a respected scholar in the study of gobies a type of 
mudsucking fish 
akihito speaks fluent english and is japans most widely 
traveled emperor he hasa made official visits to 37 countries his 
first to england for the coronation of queen elizabeth ii in 1953 
reflecting the circumstances of his upbringing akihito is often 
described by former schoolmates and palace officials as a more 
democratic warmer person than the quiet reclusive hirohito 
he has also been far more prone to set his own precedents 
just three years after completing his education akihito was 
the first emperor schooled alongside commoners the royal heir 
chose a commoner for his bride making another break from the past 
the woman michiko shoda was the daughter of one of the 
nations wealthiest businessmen but their marriage in 1959 sent 
shock waves through japans former nobility 
to the rest of the nation however the wedding was welcomed as 
none before about 500000 people lined the streets for a chance to 
see akihito and michiko in their horsedrawn carriage during a 
parade after the ceremony 
the royal couple again broke with tradition by raising their own 
children a decision prompted in part by akihitos desire to have 
the family life he was denied as a child according to minoru 
hamao a former imperial chamberlain 
taken away from his parents at an early age to be raised by 
strangers akihito at times complained of the loneliness he felt 
when his classmates would talk to him about their homes said 
hamao who served akihito for two decades 
akihitos first child and heir crown prince naruhito was born 
feb 23 1960 they have another son prince akishino and 
daughter princess nori 
though the crown prince remains single prince akishino earlier 
this year wed kiko kawashima who like the empress had no royal 
lineage

give diplomacy more time they said 
at the same time they acknowledged that a military 
confrontation may be unavoidable 
baker has rallied the leaders of eight governments to demand the 
liberation of kuwait strengthening the alliance in some ways 
with virtual unanimity baker found the leaders of the soviet 
union china britain france turkey egypt saudi arabia bahrain 
and the exiled kuwaiti regime in unanimous agreement that saddam 
husseins invaders must depart 
on top of that they endorsed the bush administrations judgment 
that partial solutions anything short of the unconditional and 
total withdrawal from the oilrich emirate was unacceptable 
but the alliance was far less cohesive when baker brought up the 
use of force even as a last resort to evict iraqi forces 
the soviet union probably the most vital member of the 
coalition apart from the united states clearly prefers to give 
political diplomacy at least two more months before pulling the 
trigger 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze gave force a very 
reluctant endorsement thursday in moscow saying probably this 
could not be ruled out under certain circumstances 
similarly chinese foreign minister qian qichen who huddled 
with baker for two hours tuesday at cairo airport gave assurances 
beijing would not veto a un resolution authorizing force 
but like soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and shevardnadze 
the chinese official urged the pursuit of a diplomatic settlement 
the same message was delivered by egyptian president hosni 
mubarak whose troops us officials said would fight alongside 
american forces in the event of war mubarak also would like at 
least two more months of diplomacy before considering a war against 
saddam hussein 
the trouble is the bush administration detects no sign that the 
iraqi leader is in a mood to yield to united nations demands that 
he release kuwait from his grip 
weve seen no evidence in all of the diplomatic activity 
thats taken place on the part of saddam hussein to even begin to 
comply with the united nations resolutions a senior official 
said friday in moscow 
besides baker said the soviets agreed with that appraisal 
despite hopeful statements gorbachev and his emissary to baghdad 
yevgeny primakov have made on occasion 
i dont think the soviets are any more optimistic than we are 
about the willingness of saddam hussein to leave kuwait baker 
told reporters who traveled with him to seven countries in eight 
days 
in fact a senior us official said primakov was basically 
stiffed during trips to iraq in september and october 
even so the bush administration is holding off on a resolution 
in the un security council baker said none was being prepared 
despite reports from new york that the united states was ready to 
call for force against iraq if peaceful political measures fail 
by contrast however president bush on thursday ordered another 
200000 american troops to the persian gulf to provide enough 
military muscle for a war against iraq 
bush said the buildup potentially to about 430000 was 
intended to ensure that the coalition has an adequate offensive 
military option should that be necessary to achieve our common 
goals 
unquestionably baker found common goals on his trip the 
primary one being that iraq should quit kuwait 
but when a senior us official was asked friday in moscow who 
would fight alongside the united states he could only guarantee 
saudi arabia egypt the ousted kuwaiti monarchy and the small 
persian gulf states 
britain probably can be counted on as well 
obviously we stand absolutely together in supporting the 
great international coalition that has been built up to see that 
aggression does not cannot and will not pay absolutely 
together prime minister margaret thatcher said after talking to 
baker on friday at 10 downing street 
the peaceful solution would be for iraq to get out of 
kuwait she said we hope they will do it if not we shall 
have to take the military option and see that iraq does leave 
kuwait 
on the other hand syria and france were listed as question 
marks in the session with reporters under rules that barred 
identifying the official 
after meeting with french president francois mitterrand and 
foreign minister roland dumas baker on saturday declined to say 
directly whether they had told him they would fight but he hinted 
as much saying we believe we are totally united 
it remains to be seen what impact the mixed message will have on 
bush when baker returned with it to washington on saturday night 
it could give the president reason to bide his time a bit at least 
to hold off until he makes his own thanksgiving holiday visit to 
the gulf

britains prince charles and delegations from more 
than 50 other nations arrived saturday for emperor akihitos 
coronation police began blocking tokyo streets to try to prevent 
terrorist attacks 
scores of foreign vips including vice president dan quayle 
will attend the ceremony which begins monday 
the coronation is the first japan has feted since akihitos 
father the late emperor hirohito was enthroned in 1928 
representatives from 28 countries most of them ambassadors to 
japan attended that ceremony 
akihitos coronation also will be the largest international 
gathering here since hirohitos funeral in february 1989 which 
drew toplevel dignitaries from 163 nations 
police have been particularly tense over the past few weeks 
because of increased violence linked to leftist radical groups 
which have threatened to annihilate the coronation and kill the 
emperor 
radicals who claimed responsibility for a blast that killed a 
police officer and injured six other people in tokyo on nov 1 are 
suspected of involvement in more than 60 incidents this year 
in the past week alone three shinto shrines and one buddhist 
temple associated with the imperial family were razed by fires 
believed set by radicals 
police on saturday reported the latest fire had destroyed a 
shrine in shiogama northeast of tokyo no injuries were reported 
charles and his wife princess diana disappointed a throng of 
photographers by being quickly whisked away from the airport for 
some rest before beginning a full schedule sunday 
to assure the foreign dignitaries a smooth ride to their hotels 
from tokyos two main airports strict controls on city freeways 
and major thoroughfares were put into effect 
the precautions are part of japans largest security 
mobilization ever involving nearly 37000 police in tokyo alone 
railway employees shut down 5000 rental lockers and began 
removing trash cans and large ashtrays from dozens of train and 
subway stations to make it harder for terrorists to hide bombs 
since commuters no longer have anywhere to throw away their 
empty soda cans station workers also taped up the coin slots of 
vending machines which have been temporarily turned off 
hundreds of thousands of wellwishers are expected to brave the 
restrictions monday and line the streets for a parade to take place 
soon after the 30minute coronation ends 
among the foreign dignitaries arriving saturday were king 
baudouin and queen fabiola of belgium german president richard von 
weizsaecker prince willemalexander of the netherlands spains 
prince don felipe and kuwaits foreign minister shaikh nassar 
muhammad alahmad alsabah 
quayle un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar and 
austrian president kurt waldheim are among those scheduled to fly 
in sunday

jawad george was excited about his engagement 
party but the family affair turned into a family feud over of 
all things iraqs invasion of kuwait jawad a secondgeneration 
arab american opposed the invasion his father and uncle didnt 
the invasion has been a wrenching experience for americans of 
arab origin torn between reluctant pride at president saddam 
hussein for standing up to the west and feelings of loyalty for 
their adopted homeland america 
a new survey one of the very few conducted among the estimated 
25 million arab americans found a community split between 
supporters and opponents of the aug 2 invasion 
of the 692 respondents surveyed by the arab american news 41 
percent said they supported saddams move 47 percent said they 
didnt and 12 percent were undecided 
the poll conducted in detroit which has a large concentration 
of arab americans also found 86 percent didnt like the deployment 
of us troops in saudi arabia at all 
some arab american leaders dispute the findings a survey 
conducted by the arab american institute for example found only 
60 percent opposed the deployment and 70 percent opposed the 
invasion 
but all agree the crisis has presented members of the community 
with a painful conflict 
when your government could be involved in war with arabs it 
causes great consternation said george executive director of 
the national association of arab americans a lobbying organization 
which counted john sununu who is of lebanese descent as one of 
its most active members until he became president bushs chief of 
staff 
george like a majority of arab americans was born here so 
were his parents their parents came here from palestine early this 
century 
his father fred a retired carpet store owner from new jersey 
is rooting for saddam when george went home to his parents for his 
engagement party a vehement argument broke out between the younger 
and older generations 
my father feels pride he thinks saddam is standing up to the 
united states he feels that very strongly said george 
many arab americans share that niggling pride in saddam for in 
their view paying back the western powers which humiliated the 
arabs for decades 
like many arab americans fred george also believes saddam is 
championing the cause of palestinians under israeli occupation his 
son said 
but george and many of his contemporaries while sympathetic to 
such views also feel iraqi atrocities in kuwait must be stopped 
the largest group of arab americans are descendants of 
immigrants from lebanon palestine and syria arabs from iraq 
kuwait or other persian gulf countries account for a small 
minority the largest group among more recent immigrants are 
palestinians many of whom fled israeli occupation 
the newer arrivals distrust us policy as blindly siding with 
israel said tony mansour chairman of the american arab heritage 
council an antidiscrimination group in detroit indeed 57 
percent of those polled in the newspaper survey said the decision 
to send american troops to the persian gulf would ultimately 
benefit israel 
and 90 percent of those asked by the aai a lobbying group which 
encourages arab americans to run for political office accused the 
administration of a double standard one toward its ally israel 
and another toward iraq 
there has to be a recognition that theres no difference in 
iraq occupying kuwait and in israel occupying the west bank gaza 
and other lands it captured in its wars with the arabs said 
mansour many feel its hypocritical to get riled up about one 
and not the other 
the administration rejects such parallels arguing that while 
israel must eventually give up occupied territory in return for 
peace the lands were captured in wars of selfdefense 
community leaders have encouraged debate about the gulf crisis 
and about worry that a war with iraq will result in a backlash 
against arab americans many arab americans feel the discrimination 
they encountered in the past has been intensified by the conflict 
with iraq 
the issue is to feel comfortable with america said james 
zogby executive director of the arab american institute i keep 
telling people this is your country even if you disagree with 
what the administration is doing 
mohamed hallaj editor of the quarterly palestine perspectives 
thinks most arab americans oppose the deployment of us troops 
because they cant understand what american interest justifies a 
possible catastrophic war 
but that doesnt call their loyalty into question he says just 
like opposing the decision to send us troops to vietnam in the 
1960s he says didnt make those people any less american

portauprince haiti ap keeping holdovers from the duvalier 
regime out of the presidential race has kindled hopes of fair 
elections but many haitians fear the candidacy of a leftist priest 
will provoke violence 
the electoral council disqualified 12 of 26 candidates from 
running in the dec 16 election many were officials of the brutal 
duvalier family dictatorsip that ruled this caribbean nation for 29 
years 
some of those rejected said they would challenge the councils 
decision in court but there was no immediate violence a similar 
prohibition in 1987 led to an armysupported rampage that forced 
the election to be canceled 
this time the army appears to be doing its job perhaps 
encouraged by the presence of about 300 election observers from 30 
countries the observers are part of a team from the united nations 
and organization of american states that will monitor the vote 
soldiers guard the electoral council headquarters city 
intersections banks and supermarkets 
the army has decided it does not want to sit down and eat at 
the table of the hardline duvalierists said louis roy 
president of the council of state a quasilegislative body that 
shares power with interim president ertha pascaltrouillot 
theirs is the fifth government since president jeanclaude 
duvalier fled to exile in france in february 1986 ending the 
dynasty begun by his father francois papa doc duvalier 
in less than five years there have been three military coups 
and a canceled election in 1987 the last election in 1988 is 
widely believed to have been rigged by the army 
this time a central question is whether the army and 
duvalierists will tolerate the candidacy of the rev jeanbertrand 
aristide a populist priest who became presidential candidate at 
the last minute 
he upset everyones calculations roy said the army must 
now decide whether or not it can swallow the morsel on the table 
set by aristide 
two candidates rejected by the electoral commission were among 
the dictatorships most notorious officials 
roger lafontant head of the private duvalier militia the 
tonton macoutes and claude raymond who was believed to be 
involved in the 1987 election massacre were disqualified for 
technical reasons 
roy said aristide may lose votes with the drop in social 
tension but he remains the leading contender because he enjoys the 
backing of the impoverished masses 
the 37yearold roman catholic priest was dismissed from the 
conservative salesian order in 1988 for being a protagonist of 
destabilization 
his outspoken pulpit oratory made him a favorite of the masses 
but an enemy of the establishment 
aristide often is accused of being a communist and has survived 
at least three assassination attempts most recently in september 
1988 
thugs supported by the army invaded his church during mass 
killed 12 parishioners and wounded dozens more followers shielded 
aristide and he escaped unharmed 
what is essential to me is not being a priest but being a 
christian he said in a recent interview when asked whether 
politics and the priesthood conflicted 
he believes in liberation theology a grassroots movement that 
has taken hold in latin america among priests and lay workers who 
advocate church involvement in the causes of the poor aristide 
describes his calls for protest as active nonviolence 
the priests candidacy may have contributed to the high number 
of registered voters about 3 million people have registered at 
least 85 percent of those eligible in this nation of 6 million 
compared with 75 percent for the aborted 1987 election 
when election officials disqualified duvalierists in 1987 a 
plague of violence began that took hundreds of lives in nightly 
shootings on election day gangs of thugs shot and hacked 34 
voters to death 
we do not provoke violence we suffer from it said 
aristide who remains a priest but cannot officiate at mass 
many middleclass haitians are skeptical of his administrative 
abilities and wary of his populist politics aristide also has 
detractors in the influential catholic hierarchy which has 
condemned his church of the poor 
the church may go so far as to unfrock aristide lest people 
think it endorses his demand for urgent social transformation 
said jeanclaude bajeux a human rights activist 
some supporters of aristide think the united states also would 
block him from the presidency because of his radicalism but the 
us embassy denied it 
we have lived with worse a highranking embassy official 
said on condition of anonymity we can learn to live with 
aristide provided he is the choice of the haitian people we only 
insist on the honesty of the electoral process

mikhail s gorbachev is deeply worried 
about red army troops in former east germany and a magazine said 
extortion terror and mysterious deaths are rampant among soviet 
forces on german turf 
speaking at a dinner late friday night the soviet president 
appealed for germans to be patient with the huge soviet army that 
is to be pulled out of former east germany over the next four 
years 
gorbachev spoke of painful tones even an antisoviet flavor 
among people in former east germany 
he said this remains a sensitive side of germansoviet 
relations 
people in eastern germany have been showing growing intolerance 
with the continued if temporary presence of the red army 
troops 
thats not the only problem confronting red army troops on 
german soil 
hundreds of red army troops are believed to have fled into the 
german woods in recent months escaping bleak garrison lives 
soviet troops desperate for german marks have reportedly been 
raiding their units weapons depots and base exchanges selling 
everything from missiles to pornographic videos 
in its most recent editions the german magazine stern painted a 
baleful picture of desperation suicides mysterious deaths and 
extortion among soviet troops in germany 
terror murder and corruption reign among the troops stern 
reported a hated occupier the 380000strong red army has 
become an army of bandits 
stern said its information came from soviet soldiers it has 
interviewed 
it quoted one former soviet officer identified as eduard 
melnikov as saying that at pay time every month older soldiers 
force younger ones to hand over protection money 
if you refuse to pay youll be thrashed nightly stern 
quoted him as saying 
extortion has spiraled in recent months because of soviet 
soldiers access to german marks since july 1 the magazine 
reported 
stern said there are growing numbers of cases where soldiers 
land in red army hospitals with broken bones and other injuries 
caused by beatings 
stanislav kaminski another soviet soldier who fled his unit 
was quoted as saying officially its called service accidents 
but everyone knows that they were beaten up by their superiors 
suicides among theps have risen dramatically because of 
such treatment it quoted one former soldier as saying 
soldiers have hanged themselves cut their wrists or poisoned 
themselves to end the misery they experience in garrison life said 
stern 
the magazine reported one case in which a 19yearold recruit 
identified as valery grischin refused to pay extortion money and 
was found dead a month after reporting for duty at a barracks near 
potsdam 
the official cause of death was suicide 
but when the soldiers parents opened his coffin in the soviet 
union they found his throat had been cut and the wound sewn back 
together said stern in addition his skull had a deep gash and 
his left arm was broken said the magazine

the main party a band from the 1st marines expeditionary force 
slung rifles and gas masks with their trumpets and tubas escorts 
carried a birthday cake on a stretcher and a color guard adorned in 
desert camouflage instead of dress blues paraded with the us and 
marine corps flags 
wed have to be up to our ears in firefights to keep us from 
celebrating said 1st sgt george spear 40 of coleman ala

no 41 near da nang in the vietnam war and put on duty in the rear 
as a cake carrier

celebrate who we are and what we are said spear 
according to one unconfirmed report a marine had called to make 
dinner reservations for 30000 at a hotel in kuwait city thats 
how many marines are on the ground in operation desert shield 
marines in the remotest desert foxholes took time from their 
duties to mark the day in 1775 when the continental congress

three burmese students who saturday 
hijacked a thai airways jetliner with 221 people aboard demanding 
the release of dissidents imprisoned in burma later surrendered to 
indian officials police said 
the last of the passengers and crew were released unharmed eight 
hours after the thai airways plane landed a senior police officer 
said on condition of anonymity the hijackers had already released 
about half the passengers 
press trust of india also quoted government officials in new 
delhi as saying the hijackers had surrendered after freeing all 
their hostages 
no details of the surrender were available immediately 
the bangkoktorangoon flight was commandeered shortly after 
takeoff by three young men armed with hand grenades and guns 
according to manish gupta home secretary of west bengal state 
indian police had surrounded the plane but stayed 200 yards away 
after the hijackers warned them not to approach the plane most of 
the police carried no visible firearms 
once on the ground the hijackers gave freed passengers a 
twopage letter outlining their demands an airport control tower 
source said on condition of anonymity 
he said the letter handwritten in english demanded the release 
of a halfdozen members of the burmese liberation front who have 
been imprisoned by burmas military government 
the hijackers also demanded a meeting with representatives of 
the governments of burma thailand and india the control tower 
source said thailands consul general in calcutta came to the 
airport but there was no sign of burmese officials 
the burmese government crushed a prodemocracy movement two 
years ago and continues to detain large numbers of people for 
political reasons 
shortly before news of the hijacking emerged reports circulated 
in bangkok that students opposed to the burmese government planned 
to hijack a plane today swedish journalist bertil lintner who has 
written books on burma received a statement from a group calling 
itself the warrior operation outlining the hijackers plans and 
demands 
do not worry for the hostages it said we have no desire 
to harm the passengers and crew we just want the world to hear 
our pleas for justice and human rights 
the groups demands included the release of prodemocracy leader 
aung san suu kyi who is under house arrest in rangoon an end to 
martial law and cancellation of all sentences passed by military 
tribunals 
prodemocracy forces in burma overwhelmingly won elections in 
may but the military government has refused to turn over power 
the airbus 320 landed in calcutta 650 miles northwest of 
rangoon before sundown the air conditioning on the plane was 
either cut off or broke down after the plane landed and some 
passengers became ill in the stuffy cabin another state official 
said on condition of anonymity 
a senior police official said the passengers were freed in a 
steady stream throughout the night some because they became ill 
a thai airways international traffic officer in bangkok 
speaking on condition of anonymity said 205 passengers and 16 crew 
members were aboard 
the pilot had radioed calcutta that he needed to make an 
unscheduled landing because of a technical malfunction the control 
tower source said upon landing the pilot manipulated the 
airplanes flaps in a way that tipped off the ground crew to a 
hijack the source said 
as the pilot taxied close to the international terminal he made 
a hand gesture that confirmed a hijacking was under way the 
control tower source said 
on oct 6 1989 two burmese students hijacked a burmese f28 
airliner with 83 people on board they surrendered peacefully to 
thai police after a 12hour siege

a conservative newspaper said saturday a gunman 
who fired shots in red square during this weeks revolution day 
parade was an activist for a leading liberal political group in 
leningrad 
alexander a shmonov was seized by plainclothes agents wednesday 
on the square after he allegedly fired two shots from a sawedoff 
hunting gun 80 yards from the reviewing stand where president 
mikhail s gorbachev and other leaders were standing 
shmonov 38 an unemployed worker from leningrad has been 
charged with attempted terrorism 
sovietskaya rossiya in a short article on its back page said 
shmonov had worked for a voters association in 1989 that was 
linked to the nationalist leningrad peoples front 
it reported he later was seen selling newspapers of the 
democratic union one of the countrys largest and most active 
leftleaning organizations in front of factories and department 
stores in the northwestern russian city 
participation in this democratic propagandizing had 
prepared him for committing this terrorist act the newspaper 
paraphrased a former coworker as saying shmonov had labored at 
the izhorsky metal working plant 
olga lipovskaya who was a leader of the democratic union group 
in leningrad until august said saturday that shmonov did not 
belong to the group while she was involved 
current leaders of the leningrad group could not immediately be 
reached for comment 
there also was no answer at the kgb public relations center 
saturday which has offered information on the man in recent days 
kgb officials have said they believe the gunman was insane and 
did not suggest a political motive for the shooting 
the daily komsomolskaya pravda newspaper reported saturday that 
psychiatric tests on the suspect have not been completed and 
officials still were unsure whether he had been trying assassinate 
anybody 
it made no mention of alleged past activism by shmonov

the 11month federal investigation of the mail 
bomb killings of a federal judge and a savannah alderman appeared 
to start slowly and bog down in a junk store in a little alabama 
town 
but out of the public eye agents had zeroed in on their prime 
suspect less than a month after the bombings 
documents in the case of accused mail bomber walter leroy moody 
show federal agents began staking out the rex ga man jan 11 
almost two weeks before highly publicized searches of the home of 
another man a junk dealer in enterprise ala 
on dec 16 11th us circuit court of appeals judge robert 
vance was killed by a mail bomb in suburban birmingham ala two 
days later savannah alderman robert robinson was killed agents 
safely intercepted two other bombs and began investigating 
threatening letters connected with the killings 
moody a selfemployed editor convicted in 1972 of possessing a 
pipe bomb was charged with the bombings wednesday 
but the first public development in the case came in alabama 
when fbi agents descended upon enterprise on jan 22 searching the 
home and even the septic tank of junk dealer robert wayne 
oferrell 
camera crews followed the agents searches and oferrell became 
something of a minor celebrity in the southeast alabama town 
selling souvenirs as he preached his innocence 
publicly the fbi was searching for typewriters it was widely 
reported that there were similarities in the typeface of critical 
letters oferrell had written the 11th circuit in atlanta and the 
bombrelated letters 
privately agents with the bureau of alcohol tobacco and 
firearms were already monitoring moodys movements and obtaining 
his telephone records 
although it would be feb 8 when atf first searched moodys 
home before the media discovered moody he knew he was being 
watched on jan 22 the day the public was riveted to enterprise 
atf agents staked out at moodys home saw the suspect and his 
wife susan drive home in a car with the license plate bugged 
the federal agents were not being particularly 
surreptitious said moodys attorney michael hauptman adding 
that moody was under constant surveillance from early january until 
his arrest in july on unrelated charges 
agents did make their presence known in the atlanta suburb 
they made their headquarters a convenience store down the street 
from moodys home and followed moody while wearing jackets with fbi 
printed on the back 
at the time fbi spokesman charles steinmetz played down the 
search saying agents had finished with moody and were headed out 
of town 
as for the apparent emphasis on the effort then under way more 
than 200 miles away in enterprise hauptman said if it had been 
primarily subterfuge they probably could have found a more 
enjoyable way of doing it than putting on rubber suits and crawling 
around in septic tanks 
but oferrells attorney anthony bishop said agents in alabama 
indicated oferrell was their only suspect 
the interest in moody way back in january is news to us 
bishop said he added that although agents could have used 
oferrell to keep media attention away from moody i would hope 
that was not their motive 
meanwhile the case against moody was being built 
court records showed vance twice had heard moodys appeals to 
the 11th circuit in a 1983 civil lawsuit claiming false arrest 
vance and other 11th circuit judges refused to reinstate the suit 
there also was an apparent link to robinson the savannah 
alderman was a former law partner of michael ford who once 
represented moody 
among the cases other elements acccording to an affidavit 
filed in federal court to obtain the feb 8 search warrant a pipe 
bomb that moody was convicted of possessing in 1972 very much 
resembled the mail bombs unlike any of 10000 other bombs agents 
have seen 
in the 1972 case moody was convicted of possessing a pipe bomb 
that exploded injuring his thenwife hazel he continued to 
appeal the conviction through 1989 vowing that new evidence proved 
he was innocent 
but a threejudge panel of the 11th circuit rejected his appeal 
and in july he and his wife susan were arrested for witness 
tampering and obstruction of justice in the case 
still moody was not yet charged with the mail bombs but

cannon fire crashed and echoed across a 
hillside cemetery saturday as prayers were said for henry wirz 125 
years after he was hanged as commander of the civil wars notorious 
andersonville prison camp 
grant that our brother may sleep in peace until you awaken him 
to glory prayed the rev ed raffetto while twodozen onlookers 
stood under a canopy in a steady downpour to honor a man they claim 
was gravely wronged 
by all accounts andersonville in south georgia was a 
nightmare ridden with disease and starvation and bulging with 
three times as many union prisoners of war as it was meant to hold 
suffering and death were everywhere 
as camp commander the 41yearold maj henry wirz a physician 
and swiss immigrant was arrested and brought to washington he was 
condemned to die for murdering prisoners hanged and buried without 
ceremony in the old capitol prison on the site now occupied by the 
supreme court 
his remains were reburied in 1869 in mount olivet cemetery two 
miles from capitol hill in northeast washington confederate 
remembrance groups call him a scapegoat who was railroaded to the 
gallows as hysteria swept washington following the murder of 
abraham lincoln they say he was a martyr who died for god and 
dixie 
wisps of incense twisted over the grave and the stars and bars 
stood beside the stars and stripes at saturdays ceremony fifty 
yards away grayclad figures with water dripping from their caps 
packed powder into a 3inch mountain howitzer and fired a 
21gun salute 
the first earthjarring roar echoed off buildings 200 yards away 
and sent acrid smoke billowing down the hillside and rising off the 
headstones 
get used to it there are going to be a lot of those said 
charles goolsby commander of jefferson davis camp no 305 sons of 
confederate veterans which sponsored the ceremony he didnt get 
any ceremony when he was buried here and this time were going to 
see that he does get one 
wreaths of red and white carnations and a wreath of tobacco 
leaves were laid at the grave raffetto an episcopal priest and 
chaplain of the sons of confederate veterans said the tobacco was 
a western maryland tradition 
swiss army col heinrich wirz laid a wreath with the colors of 
switzerland the city of zurich and the wirz family crest at the 
grave of my unfortunate great granduncle 
since boyhood my father confronted me with the destiny of 
henry wirz he said he shook hands vigorously with tommy bowers 
commander of chews battery stouts horse artillery who are 
professional reenacters who don gray and fire the cannons at 
numerous civil war ceremonies 
according to a biography supplied by the sons of confederate 
veterans heinrick hartmann wirz was born nov 25 1823 
he was educated in zurich as well as turin and paris and 
immigrated to the united states in 1849 settling in cadiz ky he

placed in command of andersonville 
at his trial he was accused of murdering eight prisoners of 
war he also was charged with conspiring with highlevel 
confederate officials to kill prisoners his partisans say the 
charges remain unproven that potential defense witnesses were 
barred and perjured testimony was presented 
all the same wirz was convicted and condemned to die by a 
commission that goolsby described at the ceremony as much like 
tribunals familiar to communist police states 
before he went to his death on nov 10 1865 goolsby said 
wirz wrote that his life is demanded as an atonement i will give 
it and i hope that after a while i will be judged differently from 
what i am today

president bushs close political adviser lee 
atwater plans to seek reelection as chairman of the republican 
national committee but likely will modify his role as he continues 
to battle an inoperable brain tumor officials said saturday 
it is his intention to seek reelection when the rnc 
members meet in january said his spokeswoman leslie goodman i 
had always expected that he would run for a second term 
she said atwater has discussed those plans only privately with 
his chief of staff mary matalin and with charles black who was 
brought in as rnc spokesman when atwater became debilitated 
he has not announced his intention to the national rnc members 
she said 
atwater now wheelchairbound continues to receive treatment 
after a pair of brain tumors weakened him and cost him the use of 
his left side 
with the 1990 elections now past the rnc is turning its 
attention to the 1992 presidential election and who will guide the 
party as it works for bushs presumed reelection bid atwater was 
bushs 1988 campaign chairman and the president named him rnc 
chairman after the election 
some republicans have said atwaters political acumen is sorely 
missed in the white house as bush was beset by economic and budget 
problems including his decision to abandon his pledge against 
raising taxes 
black a political consultant and former partner of atwaters 
does not want to remain with the committee full time said one 
source 
goodman said she did not know if atwater discussed his plans 
with bush although atwater did go to the white house a few weeks 
ago to have breakfast with the president and talk about politics 
as word of atwaters intentions circulated however prospects 
were raised that he could only take the job in a modified capacity 
one source close to the rnc said it was likely that atwater 
would assume the nowdormant post of general chairman taking 
charge of political strategy but would not carry out the 
chairmans travel and speechmaking duties 
he is improving but not to the point where he can do a full 
time job said the source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
he could not perform as he did before he could be active in 
terms of strategy but hes not going to be able to take up a full 
travel schedule 
goodman said there had been no specific discussions along those 
lines but stated there are certain elements of the job that are 
certainly more difficult to the extent that lee feels he can 
manage the job he would give consideration to whatever parts he 
felt he couldnt do 
the spokeswoman said gop committee members with whom she had 
spoken have been very supportive of a possible second atwater 
term despite his health problems 
goodman said atwaters doctors have been encouraged by his 
recovery and response to treatment for the tumor that was 
diagnosed in march 
intensive radiation treatments shrunk a second tumor that 
cropped up several weeks later atwater 39 has shown remarkable 
progress friends say after he was considered near death at some 
points during the illness 
he has been dictating a book about his life and politics and 
has made a few appearances at the rnc offices 
he seems to be gaining his strength seeing more people going 
out goodman said 
he is still very focused on recovering he has by no means 
been conducting a full work schedule he gave no indication of when 
he wants to start coming into the office on a full time basis 
she said

when andy cox retired from the us 
army in 1977 after 22 years in the military he took for granted 
the promise of lifelong health care 
that was until he fell off a ladder in 1987 suffering a 
traumatic head injury which left him a quadriplegic unable to 
speak even swallow 
costs for his aroundtheclock treatment were high but his 
militarysponsored health insurance was good while it lasted but 
provision in the law stripped him of that coverage and put him 
under the medicare program with fewer benefits 
theres was one thing they forgot to tell him when he was 
fighting for his country for 22 years said coxs wife terry 
you only get to keep your health insurance if you stay healthy 
cox isnt alone many military retirees dont find out until 
its too late about provisions that end coverage under the civilian 
health and medical program of the uniformed services champus if 
they are disabled and require continuous medical care for longer 
than two years or when they reach the age of 65 
under the 1972 law when champus ends the governmentsubsidized 
health care plan medicare takes over but veterans say the swap 
cheats them of benefits they earned leaving them with coverage 
that is not nearly so extensive in severe cases like coxs 
for cox 53 who has remained almost motionless in bed since his 
injury medicare has been of little help it offers limited 
provisions for home health care and none for him since his case 
was classified as maintenance 
the couple has been left financially devastated 
theres a lot of people out there who dont have the coverage 
they think they have said patrick deleon administrative 
assistant to sen daniel inouye dhawaii trouble is you dont 
hear about them until theyre hit with a situation like this 
mrs cox also has fired off letters to president bush 
congressmen senators and military officials asking that the law be 
changed to allow her husband back in the champus program which 
covers people in the military military retirees and dependents 
when they seek care in civilian hospitals because of lack of space 
in or distance from a military facility 
shes gotten back a stack of letters but no action 
i truly sympathize with your situation and concerns 
responded capt paul t mcdavid director of the department of 
defenses champus office in aurora colo however i am limited 
in authority to effect a change 
inouye introduced a bill last year that would have changed the 
law to extend champus coverage to people like cox and to retired 
military personnel under medicare who become ill while out of the 
country medicare does not carry coverage overseas champus does 
the bill died without a vote largely because the department of 
defense had not yet provided figures on exactly how many veterans 
are affected and the possible cost deleon said 
were going to wait on those figures before we introduce the 
bill again in the next session deleon said senators cant 
decide on anything until they know how much it might cost 
but mrs cox knows ll too well about costs emotional as well 
as financial 
when cox was diagnosed after his fall with a subdural hematoma 
bleeding within the skull around the brain some doctors said he 
would be a vegetable for the rest of his life 
after a year in hospitals and rehabilitation centers he was 
sent home still semicomatose breathing with the aid of oxygen 
and taking his food through feeding tubes hooked into his stomach 
with his champus coverage cox received 24hour skilled nursing 
care physical and speech therapy and prescription drugs mrs cox 
estimates champus was providing 17000 in home health care every 
month 
at his st petersburg home he slowly began to improve no longer 
was he considered semicomatose he was weaned from oxygen and his 
darting eyes and guttural sounds hinted that he was responding to 
those around him 
but last april 1 coxs eligibility for champus ended word came 
in a department of defense letter asking the veteran who retired in 
1977 after serving in korea and germany to return his eligibility 
card listing coverage as indefinite 
i couldnt believe it i thought it had to be some kind of 
mistake said mrs cox part of the reason he decided to make a 
career out of the military was the benefits knowing hed always be 
taken care of 
he has a sergeants pension at about 700 monthly for service in 
the army navy and the reserves which makes him ineligible for 
health programs for the needy 
mrs cox has been forced to sell their home and furniture move 
in with her mother and scrape together 5500 to 6000 every month 
to provide what care she can but she said her savings cant hold 
out forever 
despite it all she remains resolute 
they did it to the wrong family this time she said 
defiantly my husband spent his life serving his country now 
its time for his country to start serving him

a new international treaty takes effect 
sunday to eliminate safe havens for drug lords by letting 
governments extradite them seize their bank accounts and property 
and open their financial records 
the un convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs 
and psychotropic substances binds the united states mexico canada 
and 24 other nations that have adopted it to cooperate in battling 
drug traffickers 
sixtytwo more nations and the european economic community have 
signed the convention indicating they will adopt it 
attorney general dick thornburgh lauded its adoption saying 
that under this treaty signatory nations are obligated to 
criminalize each link in the chain of illicit drugrelated 
activities from the initial production of drugs to the final 
laundering of profits 
and while respecting the sovereignty of each nation this 
agreement mandates unprecedented cooperation in investigations 
prosecutions and where appropriate extraditions in drugrelated 
cases thornburgh said 
chinas minister of public security wang fang said it is a 
powerful weapons for national drug law enforcement agencies 
throughout the world and has major significance in combating the 
increasingly rampant activities of international drug 
trafficking 
the convention criminalizes each step of the drug trafficking 
process from cultivation or production of precursor chemicals to 
laundering of profits 
among its major provisions 
all signatory nations agree to share evidence of criminal 
conduct and to extradite accused traffickers eliminating safe 
havens 
nations agree to adopt banking laws that allow them to seize 
drug profits and banking records 
the manufacture and sale of chemicals needed to make drugs is 
to be monitored and controlled in each nation 
shipments of illegal drugs are to be allowed to pass through 
countries so law enforcement agencies can trace them to their 
recipients a technique common in the united states but new in 
international law 
signatory nations will require commercial shipping airline 
and other transport companies to take steps to make sure their 
carriers are not used to carry drugs 
it aims to hit the drug traffickers where it hurts the most 
that is to say in their freedom of movement and their liberty 
said margaret j anstee coordinator of un drug controlrelated 
activities 
the convention is a determined statement by the international 
community that it will not tolerate the misery degradation and 
death being perpetrated by drug traffickers on a massive scale 
said anstee

international conference in vienna in december 1988

ratified or acceded to by 20 nations

a world war ii historian says the marine 
corps treated a veterans family unfairly when it decided the 
former marine wasnt in a famous world war ii photograph of marines 
raising the us flag on iwo jima 
the marines initially identified sgt henry hansen of 
somerville mass as one of six men in the pulitzer prizewinning 
photograph but the corps changed its position two years later 
after another soldiers family complained both of the soldiers had 
died in the war 
professor parker b albee a professor at the university of 
southern maine says his two years of independent research 
indicates the marines investigation was not thorough enough 
i think the marine corps should pursue the investigation and 
reopen the case albee said its been gnawing at the family 
for three generations 
but the marine corps said friday that it doesnt see a need for 
another investigation 
the photograph was taken by associated press photographer joe 
rosenthal on feb 23 1945 as the marines raised the flag atop 
mount suribachi during one of the bloodiest battles in the pacific 
hansen was initially identified by one of the pictured survivors 
as the man standing at the far right in the photo 
three of the six marines including hansen were later killed in 
combat as japanese troops fought to maintain a hold on the 
strategic island 
hansens mother madeline evelley joined the three survivors 
later that year at a war bond rally where she was honored and 
given a copy of the photo 
two years later the marine corps said the man first thought to 
be hansen was actually cpl harlon h block of weslaco texas a 
marine also killed in action 
stunned by the change hansens mother wrote to the marine corps 
commandant and to members of the massachusetts congressional 
delegation seeking an explanation 
the marine corp told her it had conducted a throrough 
investigation but it never presented any evidence to back up its 
finding albee said 
evelley died convinced that her son was among the six in the 
picture her four surviving children also thought the marines 
investigation was unfair and passed their doubts to a third 
generation 
evelleys granddaughter judy galgay of naples asked the 
professor to investigate 
this was always told to us as children growing up that the man 
at the base of the flag was our uncle henry she said friday 
albee said he combed through papers of the hansen and evelley 
families and other manuscripts and concluded the marine corps 
investigation was neither fair nor thorough 
one survivor rene gagnon of manchester nh identified the 
other five marines in the picture when he was ordered back to the 
united states in 1945 he said hansen was among the five 
but a year later blocks parents wrote to another survivor ira 
hayes of sacaton ariz saying they had heard the marine 
identified as hansen was actually their son 
hayes agreed triggering a second examination of the photograph 
after reading an affidavit from hayes gagnon and the third 
survivor john bradley of antigo wis changed their stories and 
told a threemember board of officers that the man may have been 
block 
albee says bradley and gagnon may have been pressured into 
agreeing with hayes gagnon has since died and bradley doesnt talk 
to reporters 
rosenthal who lives in san francisco said the marines who 
raised the flag dispersed after he shot the picture and he was not 
able to get their names 
albee said he is not sure whether the man whose identity is in 
dispute was hansen block or someone else 
it could be one of them or it could be neither of them 
albee said 
he suggested that the matter be reopened and that investigators 
study other photographs taken about the same time by two still 
photographers and one with a movie camera 
the one way to resolve it at this point in time is through a 
careful study of the pictures which i am surprised they didnt do 
at the time he said 
robert aquilina assistant head of the reference section at the 
marine corps historical center in washington dc said the 
marines made a mistake when it first said hansen was in the 
photograph 
i think they made a quick judgment that it was hansen who was 
in the photo then they found out later that it was block my 
understanding is that block was identified by the survivors 
aquilina said 
but albee says the marines evidence wasnt convincing 
i have a feeling that they wanted a conclusion and felt under 
pressure to know who it was he said i wish they said it was 
unknown or had conducted the investigation thoroughly and fairly 
to a logical end

reinforcements the rebels finally retreated with soldiers in 
pursuit the army said

to enter negotiations with the government of president cesar 
gaviria

secretary of state james a baker iii on saturday claimed 
success in his mission to shore up the antiiraq coalition but the 
baghdad government accused the united states of dragging its alies 
toward a war they did not want 
baker flew back to washington after a weeklong round of 
diplomacy that ended with talks in paris after meeting with french 
president francois mitterrand he expressed satisfaction with the 
state of the alliance that came together after iraqi president 
saddam husseins troops seized kuwait on aug 2 
we believe we are totally united the secretary of state 
told reporters we have built a consensus we have increased the 
pressure on saddam hussein 
but he added we must heighten the pressure further indeed 
we have to lay the foundation for the use of force should that 
become necessary clearly one way to do that is to get ready 
militarily 
after the paris meeting it was still unclear whether the french 
would be willing to fight iraq france has sent 13000 troops to 
the persian gulf region 
before bakers talks with mitterrand a senior american official 
had expressed doubts over frances commitment to the alliance 
baker declined to say directly whether mitterrand and foreign 
minister roland dumas had pledged french participation in any 
military action against saddam however he called their talks 
very positive and successful 
mitterrands spokesman hubert vedrine said the french 
president told baker that frances position consists of the 
strict application of un security council resolutions 
those resolutions have included the economic sanctions against 
iraq a call for the unconditional withdrawal of iraqi troops from 
kuwait and the demand that all foreign hostages be freed 
during bakers trip us officials said the american contingent 
in the gulf would be increased by up to 200000 troops already 
about 230000 us forces are deployed in the region facing 
430000 iraqi troops in southern iraq and kuwait 
iraqs foreign minister said the plans to dramatically 
strengthen the us deployment proved that washington had planned 
an offensive from the beginning the iraqi official tariq aziz 
said president bush had misled the governments of saudi arabia and 
egypt and other nations about the true mission of the multinational 
force 
the increased deployment makes those who sent troops to the 
region partners in the american designs for aggression against 
iraq aziz said in a statement carried by the official iraqi news 
agency 
a senior us official said baker had not encountered opposition 
to a un resolution to authorize force to liberate kuwait during 
the trip he consulted with the governments of the soviet union 
china britain france saudi arabia egypt turkey and bahrain 
plus the kuwaiti governmentinexile

deborah holmes grew up on the steamy streets 
of a housing project where children spend their days dodging 
bullets and drug dealers 
she was determined her son would not spend his childhood in the 
crime ridden project she wanted a home of her own and the 
neighborhood development foundation helped her realize that goal 
i thought about it all the time even before i heard about 
the program she said once i got into that just knowing it 
could happen that i could own a home kept me going 
now holmes and her mother own a twofamily house they are 
among 343 working poor people who have bought homes through the 
foundation 
ndf was founded in 1986 by john and holly pavy deblois a 
wealthy couple who believed one of new orleans main problems was 
the lack of homeowners in the city said norma l freiberg 
executive director 
in most cities roughtly 40 percent of households are renters 
but in new orleans 70 percent of the residents rent 
what you see in new orleans more than in most cities are 
absentee landlords rental properties that are allowed to 
deteriorate freiberg said 
the more people who own homes the better off we all are she 
said putting just one homeowner on a block can stabilize the 
entire block once someone owns a house they start thinking in 
terms of property values 
the ndf program includes a 12hour course in budget management 
home selection financing and maintenance ndf also acts as an 
advocate and adviser to clients while they select and purchase 
houses and helps clients find mortgages with reduced rates 
the foundation believed to be the only program of its kind in 
the nation has generated more than 13 million in real estate 
sales freiberg said 
we dont give people houses said fred johnson ndfs 
outreach specialist we teach people to save and we teach them 
how to buy a house we teach them how to take care of that house 
once they buy it 
there is no free ride and our buyers know it he said 
its ludicrous to think you can buy property without money 
to be eligible clients must have incomes between the federal 
housing and urban development agencys low and very low ranges 
they must also demostrate stable employment and an established 
credit history and be able to make a minimum 1500 down payment 
i had to put up 2000 said huet toney 48 it wasnt 
easy i saved for years but i did it 
toney who makes less than 20000 a year as a custodian for the 
university of new orleans moved his wife and 15yearold son into 
their house in june 1989 
the foundation helped me understand how buying a house works 
and what i had to do he said 
we try to demystify the process for people freiberg said 
its not just exposure to buying a house its exposure to 
reallife processes like using a lawyer or reading contracts many 
of our clients have never done these things before and have no one 
to show them the steps it takes 
the average income of the ndf homeowners is 16725 the average 
price of their houses is 45600 freiberg said 
many of our people work two jobs to get the money they need to 
buy she said it requires a real commitment 
once clients make the commitment ndf helps them find creative 
ways to buy houses in holmes case she and her mother used their 
combined incomes to qualify for their house 
the twofamily house gives each woman a threebedroom residence 
and their montly payment is less than than the rent they paid for 
two apartments in the housing project 
toney said ndf helped him buy a home sooner than he could have 
bought one on his own 
i always believed anything is possible if you put your mind to 
it toney said this program just made it possible faster

an estimated 30000 people gathered 
saturday to mark the anniversary of the downfall of communist 
dictator todor zhivkov who broke a years public silence to mock 
efforts to convict him for abuses in office 
the rally was staged by the governing socialist party which is 
struggling with serious economic problems and battling opposition 
parties over the nations leadership 
speakers for the socialists formerly the communist party told 
they crowd they took a major step toward democracy by ousting 
zhivkov who is jailed as prosecutors work on the case against him 
we are a 100yearold party and we will be around for another 
100 years deputy party chairman alexander tomov told the crowd 
we must move into the offensive not against democracy and the 
rule of law but an offensive in the name of truth 
party leaders did not indicate whether they were nearer to 
resolving a dispute with the opposition union of democratic forces 
which is refusing to back premier andrei lukanov in parliament 
president zhelyu zhelev failed late friday to mediate between 
the parties 
in june the socialists defeated the udf in bulgarias first 
free elections in 58 years but the governments popularity has 
waned as the economic crisis deepens opposition leaders now claim 
they would win if new elections were held 
at the rally speakers were heckled by opposition activists who 
led several hundred people in a counterdemonstration 
several people were taken to hospital with slight injuries after 
police broke up scuffles between the socialist and demonstrators 
the state news agency bta reported 
zhivkov in his first public comments since his ouster claimed 
the charges against him have no legal basis and prosecutors are 
resigning one after the other in frustration at not being able 
to substantiate the allegations 
he also suggested that someone else was in control of the 
country after 1984 but refused to elaborate it was not the 
right time for this question he said in an interview with the 
trud weekly newspaper 
zhivkov 79 was deposed nov 10 1989 after 35 years of 
autocratic rule he has been charged with misappropriation of state 
property inciting hostility against ethnic turks and grave abuses 
of power no trial date has been set 
misuse of state property among the most serious charges 
carries a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison but the deposed 
leader claimed in the newspaper interview there is no law under 
which he can be convicted 
i made two important mistakes in my life bta quoted 
zhivkov a widower since 1971 one was that i didnt marry when i 
was alone and still could do it my other mistake is that i 
didnt retire on pension 10 years ago thats all i havent made 
any other mistakes 
bulgaria is suffering through its worst economic crisis with 
key foodstuffs rationed or unavailable and inflation and 
unemployment rising rapidly the nations foreign debt is estimated 
at 11 billion 
no resolution of the government deadlock was expected before 
wednesday when parliament meets for its next session

ancient precious gold coins stolen by 
workmen from their hiding place behind a wall in a medieval house 
have been recovered by police and turned over to a cairo museum 
threequarters of the 3611 medieval coins in the priceless 
collection were minted in europe mainly in italian citystates 
that produced the money of international commerce in the middle 
ages such coins never had been found in egypt 
stashed for centuries the cache contained nearly 28 pounds of 
gold it comprised european egyptian and tunisian coins all 
minted between the 12th and 16th centuries 
according to police reports the saga of the coins began last 
spring in a house named for a 19thcentury slave of turkish origin 
zainab khatoun the house is registered as a historic monument and 
was being rehabilitated by workers contracted by the egyptian 
antiquities organization 
in may workmen dismantling a sagging wall found two jars 
containing gold coins and secretly took the booty seven suspects 
were arrested and the coins returned after a police tipster alerted 
authorities to the recent appearance on the illegal antiquities 
market of large numbers of gold coins 
when the report hit the newspapers a granddaughter of the 
turkish slave sued the government asserting ownership 
but antiquities officials claimed possession under an egyptian 
law giving the government ownership of objects older than 100 
years last month police signed over the coins to cairos islamic 
museum 
this is the first time weve found most of these coins in 
egypt but we know from records they were widely used in the 
bazaars of the time we even have their exchange rates said 
siham elmahdy curato of the 10000coin collection at the 
museum 
cairo newspapers have had fun figuring out the collections 
worth estimates have reached 300 million based on the weight 
alone the gold is valued at 170000 
were not going to melt the coins down for their gold were 
going to study them said elmahdy whose doctorate was in coins 
of the middle ages the cache is priceless 
the coins will help paint a picture of what went on in the great 
bazaars of medieval cairo she said the city was a warren of 
markets selling silks and spices from the east exotica from africa 
and damask satin and brocades from the textile centers of the 
world 
arab rulers who had a long tradition of minting gold coins at 
first tried to imitate the quality of european coins eventually 
they gave up but islamic currency still was legal tender in cairo 
marketplaces alongside the more valuable european money 
elmahdy said the european coins in the cache include 1890 
venetian ducats and 121 gold florins from florenc a rival trading 
city 
they are the real treasure she said beautifully made of 
topquality gold the italian coins depict christian figures 
including jesus and john the baptist rulers of venice and the 
lilies of florence 
the islamic coins dated to 1517 when politics were so volatile 
that rulers sometimes lasted only a few days the new collection 
contains rare pieces from the period because some rulers were 
killed before more than a few coins could be minted in their honor 
elmahdy said

to prepare for an earthquake a scientist 
has predicted could strike the new madrid fault zone on dec 3 
some residents are stockpiling bottled water but others are 
stockpiling beer 
some people are taking new mexico climatologist iben brownings 
prediction seriously 
browning says theres a 5050 chance for an earthquake measuring 
7 or greater on the richter scale along the new madrid fault on or 
about dec 3 the fault runs from cairo ill to marked tree 
ark and was the source of a series of severe quakes in the early 
19th century 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs a 7 reading is a major earthquake capable of 
widespread damage in a populated region 
most scientists believe that the region could be hit by a strong 
quake the coming years but put little stock in brownings theory 
which is based on the timing of strong tidal forces in early 
december 
nevertheless schools in southeast missouris bootheel region 
the faults center and in parts of illinois kentucky arkansas 
and tennesee already have canceled classes for dec 3 and 4 
shoppers have been cleaning out stores supplies of items like 
bottled water and can openers and travel agents have been busy 
helping people make plans to get away for the week 
but others are choosing to believe the scientists who criticize 
brownings projection 
at haps bar and grill in new madrid owner jack hailey is 
taking advantage of anxiety that has taken hold of the zone 
haileys planning an allday shake rattle and roll party 
featuring a bottomless pot of gumbo a st louis radio station 
plans to broadcast live from the tavern 
the new madrid historical museum has been selling tshirts that 
say visit new madrid while its still here and its our 
fault 
and although the museums 1886 building probably wont be safe 
in a major quake cnn and another st louis radio station plan to 
broadcast from there on dec 3 
but while members of the media flock into the area some 
residents plan to get their whole families out 
at travel with flair in sikeston about 20 miles north of here 
the sign outside advertises a get out of town quake sale 
the hysteria down here is unbelievable said manager joe 
miller one guy today bought a oneway ticket to phoenix he said 
hed buy the other one when the earthquakes over 
one popular destination is springfield on the western side of 
missouri 
that citys convention and tourists bureau ran a oneday 
advertisement in bootheel newspapers urging residents to take a 
break from the quake 
the ad generated more than 400 responses said tracy kimberlin 
the bureaus executive director 
springfield sits on a great deal of bedrock kimberlin said 
all the information we have read says that springfield would feel 
it but would have little if any damage 
experts say the new madrid fault produces about 200 quakes a 
year most hardly felt a moderate quake shook the area on sept 26 
and another one struck thursday 
neither quake caused any damage but both rattled residents 
already frazzled nerves 
in cape girardeau even students at southeast missouri state are 
reacting to earthquake hype said kim reeves editor of the student 
paper the capaha arrow 
dec 3 begins the last week of classes before final exams but 
reeves said she thinks most students wont be studying on campus 
ive got a feeling half of the students will fly the coop 
reeves said 
missouri gov john ashcroft hoped to ease fears in the southeast 
part of the state by planning a trip to the bootheel region on dec 
3 to visit some agricultural enterprises 
hes going to southeast missouri because dec 3 and dec 4 are 
like any other days said bob ferguson the governors spokesman 
ashcrofts office rejected a request from bootheel county clerks 
to reschedule a special senate election set for dec 4 the clerks 
expressed concern that voter turnout would be low because of people 
leaving the area 
the governor agrees with the leading scientists who say you 
cant forecast these things down to a day ferguson said and 
you really do a disservice to the public when you unnecessarily 
frighten them by trying to target some narrow period as the time 
for an earthquake 
but people are frightened said arnold bell school 
superintendent in caruthersville missouri education officials say 
as many as 40000 missouri students will be out of school dec 3 
and 4 
its easy i guess to say if you dont live here that its 
silly to worry about quakes and all bell said but we live 
with it and its hard not to get caught up in the spirit of the 
concern

an official committee has 
rejected claims by two former police officers that they took part 
in death squads that targeted antiapartheid figures the 
government announced saturday 
the report by tim mcnally attorney general for the orange free 
state province and police lt gen alwyn conradie was completed in 
november 1989 but not released until saturday 
a similiar inquiry into the unsolved killings of more than 60 
opposition activists has also been conducted that report is 
expected to be released shortly but there has been no indication 
of its findings 
antiapartheid groups have long accused security forces of 
killing opposition figures and are expected to protest the 
committees findings 
there was no immediate comment from police who have previously 
denied the existence of death squads they have claimed any 
campaign against antiapartheid figures was carried out by 
individuals acting on their own 
saturdays report involved charges by a former policeman on 
death row and his former superior they claimed they killed more 
than 10 people during the 1980s including durban antiapartheid 
lawyer griffiths mxenge in 1981 
the report said the allegations by almond nofomela and former 
police capt dirk coetzee were untrue and information from both men 
was unreliable 
a departmental inquiry into alleged misconduct by coetzee had 
recommended his dismissal from the force because he was a risk to 
its security the report said but because he was a diabetic 
coetzee was permitted to retire at a reduced salary on medical 
grounds 
coetzee who is white fled the country last year and claimed to 
have joined the african national congress the largest black 
opposition group 
nofomela first made the accusations oct 19 1989 the day 
before he was scheduled to be executed for a killing with no 
apparent political overtones 
he named coetzee and another former policeman as having carried 
out killings with him 
nofomela later pleaded guilty to the stabbing death of mxenge 
he remains in jail the other man david tshikalanga has fled the 
country and also claimed to have taken part in killings authorized 
by superiors 
the report said nofomelas account of mxenges killing was 
inconsistent with other testimony in the case making his 
statements unreliable 
but there was no explanation for why the government charged 
nofomela with mxenges killing and accepted his guilty plea 
earlier saturday two youths were killed and 18 people injured 
in a black township where residents protesting an electricity 
cutoff clashed with police 
in the atteridgeville township outside pretoria violence broke 
out as residents tried to restore electrical power to their homes 
authorities cut the power last week because residents have 
stopped paying bills to protest living conditions and local 
officials who township residents consider collaborators with the 
whiteled government 
two youths ages 11 and 18 died of shotgun wounds and 17 
protesters were treated for birdshot wounds maj ray harrald said 
he said it was unclear if the deaths and injuries were because of 
the police action 
one policeman was hit by a rock and received stitches harrald 
said

the internal revenue service has seized 
countywestern singer willie nelsons property in six states to 
satisfy 65 million in claims an irs spokeswoman said 
the fashionable pedernales country club and recording studio 
which nelson calls home was closed at least temporarily in the 
friday seizures said irs spokeswoman sally sassen 
today in a coordinated effort internal revenue service 
employees went out to seize property that was owned by willie 
nelson so that we could satisfy the money that is owed to the 
government to protect the governments interests sassen said 
the seizures came less than two months after the agency slapped 
tax liens of 167 million against nelsons private property 
nelsons manager and his attorneys did not immediately return phone 
calls saturday seeking comment 
we have seized everything there and the country club and 
recording studio will not be in operation sassen said 
besides the austinarea properties some of nelsons holdings in 
hawaii california washington colorado and alabama also were 
seized ms sassen said 
liens were filed on taxes that the irs alleged nelson and his 
estranged wife connie owed from 1975 through 1982 except for the 
1979 tax year she said 
also seized in the austin area were a house ranch more than 
100 lots and several condominiums she said the property would be 
released to the singer if he pays off the back taxes 
nelson says his tax troubles began in 1986 when a former 
business manager was careless with his finances and irs filings 
court documents show that nelson later hired an accounting firm to 
correct some discrepancies

israel has been offered a formula that could 
break an impasse over its refusal to accept a un investigation 
into the killing of 20 palestinians during a jerusalem riot 
diplomatic sources said saturday 
the language worked out with us officials under the guidance 
of israeli ambassador zalman shoval calls for united nations 
secretary general javier perez de cuellar to send an envoy to 
israel to discuss various arabisraeli issues the sources said 
but the emissarys role would be described only in general 
terms steering away from any mention of the oct 8 riot which 
began when palestinians threw stones at jewish worshipers and ended 
with israeli police killing 20 palestinians the sources said 
israel so far has rejected any un investigation of the 
killings 
the formula has been forwarded to israel and it likely will be 
debated sunday by the israeli cabinet said the sources who spoke 
only on condition of anonymity but hardline members of the 
government are expected to oppose it they added 
the formula also could run into opposition at the un security 
council which has adopted two resolutions calling for an 
investigation of the violence at a jerusalem site revered by both 
moslems and jews 
in refusing an investigation the israeli government has cited 
years of un hostility and concerns that such a probe would call 
into question israeli sovereignty over jerusalem 
israel annexed the eastern part of jerusalem where the riot 
occurred after capturing it from jordan in a 1967 war most 
countries refuse to recognize the annexation 
the united states which traditionally vetoes antiisrael 
resolutions at the united nations voted twice in favor of an 
investigation 
critics accused the administration of sacrificing its friendship 
with israel to ensure the cohesion of the international coalition 
against iraq which includes many arab and third world countries 
who oppose the strong usisraeli alliance 
a third resolution under consideration would call for a un 
force to protect the lives of the estimated 17 million 
palestinians under israeli occupation in the west bank and gaza 
strip 
president bush on thursday refused urgings from jewish leaders 
that the united states veto a third resolution if it comes up 
other sources said bush the sources said instead urged israel 
again to accept a un emissary he made a similar appeal to prime 
minister yitzhak shamir in two letters in recent weeks but was 
rebuffed 
when told by the jewish group that his refusal to veto a third 
resolution could be construed to mean the united states only cares 
about the antiiraq coalition bush reportedly raised his voice 
he said my prime concern is the safety of the 250000 troops 
in the persian gulf region said one source 
a white house spokesman sean walsh declined to comment 
saturday 
when they emerged from the meeting the jewish leaders told 
reporters they had received a commitment that the united states 
retains its strong support for israel 
bush told reporters the same thing when he met with them about 
an hour later at a white house news conference

cogan 46 a lawyer from houston the hijackers moved women and 
children to the front and the men to the back of the plane when 
people moved the hijacker would threaten to push the button on 
the fake bomb but he repeated several times that he meant no 
harm 
indian officials initially said there were three hijackers 
because a communique from the hijackers had three signatures and 
was stamped in blood with three thumprints the communique was 
released with some of the first passengers to be freed who said 
the hijackers had hand grenades and guns 
ye marn told the news conference we wanted to draw

aung san suu kyi who is under house arrest in rangoon and two 
burmese students jailed in thailand for hijacking a burmese plane 
last year to dramatize demands for freedom from military rule 
other demands included an end to martial law the release of 
all political prisoners and cancellation of all military tribunals 
and the sentences imposed by them 
we want to establish democratic rights in burma the 
hijackers letter said for the past 25 years the people cried 
for liberty but the answer was bullets 
burmas military government crushed a prodemocracy movement two 
years ago and continues to detain large numbers of people for

the government said a mercenary army 
supported by neighboring libya and sudan mounted a major assault on 
its forces in eastern chad on saturday 
the cabinet held an emergency meeting and issued a communique 
that said the attack was launched at daybreak along the chadsudan 
border by the islamic legion the government says the group is a 
mercenary army supported by sudan and libya 
sudan and libya have denied sponsoring any armed opposition to 
the chad government they say fighting on the border region over 
the past year is a conflict solely between chads government and 
dissidents 
the chadian communique said there was intense combat in the tine 
region involving attackers heavily and massively equipped by the 
enemies of chad it made no mention of casualties 
it said the attack was launched from the darfour region of 
western sudan and that libya and sudan were totally and entirely 
responsible 
libya and chad fought a war in the early 1980s and have since 
engaged in sporadic negotiations over their disputed border the 
most recent round of talks were held last month 
in these conditions this new armed aggression is nothing but 
a flagrant manifestation of the duplicity by chads enemies and 
their desire to destabilize and totally destroy chad the 
communique said

the ruling revolutionary institutional 
party of president carlos salinas de gortari has proclaimed a new 
image for elections sunday in one state 
the party which for 61 years has controlled nearly all aspects 
of mexican politics is seeking to convince an indifferent 
electorate that it has cast off old practices and launched reforms 
but the party faces growing opposition in conservative regions 
of mexico state which borders mexico city 
opposition leaders claim the party will resort to fraud in the 
voting for 121 mayors and the 34member state legislature 
with its 10 million residents the state of mexico is the 
biggest of the countrys 31 states only the separate federal 
district which includes mexico city has more people 
about 80 percent of the states population lives in urban areas 
around the national capital those areas as well as mexico city 
voted against salinas in the presidential election two years ago 
mexico state includes everything from wealthy and middleclass 
suburbs to shantytowns where thousands of rural newcomers live in 
squalor 
the governing party hopes to benefit from recent construction of 
roads water systems and other services in some impoverished areas 
while it maintains control of nearly all politics in the 
country its strength has been eroding in some areas 
democracy must win twice gov ignacio pichardo said 
thursday it must win at the polls with a free election and its 
must win in the minds of the public with credible results 
eight political parties are running but only the governing 
party the conservative national action party and the leftist party 
of the democratic revolution are expected to win any offices 
electoral officials estimate only 40 percent of the 45 million 
registered voters will turn out 
cuauhtemoc cardenas leader of the leftist opposition party 
called this week for a postponement of the elections saying the 
voter rolls were rigged and the governing party was poised to 
commit computer fraud 
electoral officials dismissed the accusation 
luis h alvarez leader of the rightist opposition party urged 
a large turnout of voters to reduce the possibility of ballot

attorneys in a classaction discrimination 
lawsuit against holiday spas said saturday they will run ads this 
week in 16 east coast newspapers seeking blacks who believe they 
were the victims of bias at the health clubs 
on orders from us district judge joseph c howard in 
baltimore the plaintiffs in the suit against the spas owners 
us health inc and its subsidiary holiday universal inc of 
towson md will begin the advertisements sunday said mark 
leimkuhler an attorney for the plaintiffs 
the notice headline will read if you are black and have 
sought to become or became a member of a holiday spa read this 
notice carefully 
the ads describe the federal lawsuit and what people who believe 
they were discriminated against should do if they wish to alert the 
court to their identities now or if they want to be excluded from 
the class action leimkuhler said 
the court he said wants to know how many people may be in the 
class 
we believe based on the records that we have which are 
incomplete as well as the testimony of employees and former 
employees that the class size could easily range into the 
thousands leimkuhler said how many thousands im not sure 
leimkuhler of the law firm of wilmer cutler amp pickering said 
his office already has mailed notices to more than 2000 people 
from boston to atlanta who may be members of the class 
the lawsuit alleges that the clubs discouraged blacks from 
joining certain spas by giving them only brief tours telling them 
only of the most expensive memberships or directing them to apply 
to predominantly black clubs 
in addition the lawsuit contends sales people wrote dnwam 
meaning do not want as members in their sales books as a code 
referring to potential black customers 
the companies which run the clubs known as holiday spas 
holiday espre centers holiday health and racket centers and 
holiday supreme spas have denied the allegations there was no 
answer saturday at a phone number listed for the health clubs 
attorney or at the companys main number in towson 
the justice department accused holiday spas of discriminating 
against blacks in 1989 but settled the case that year when the club 
owners accepted a consent order 
the spas agreed to show blacks in advertising to include a 
statement that they do not discriminate against minorities and to 
give blacks who may have been turned away another chance to join 
the consent order said it was not to be considered in any way 
an admission or finding of any discrimination 
leimkuhler said the ads will inform potential plaintiffs that 
they must make themselves known at some point but not necessarily 
immediately in order to share in any recovery that may result from 
a trial scheduled to begin next february or from any settlement 
the ads will run in general circulation newspapers the 
washington post the sun of baltimore the atlanta 
journalconstitution the boston globe and the philadelphia 
inquirer as well as 11 newspapers that cater primarily to black 
readership 
those newspapers are the greater news in boston the 
philadelphia tribune and philadelphia metro the baltimore times 
and baltimore afroamerican the washington informer washington 
news observer and the washington afroamerican and the atlanta 
inquirer atlanta voice and atlanta daily world 
leimkuhler said the ads will cost at least 40000 and are being 
paid for mainly by the law firm which is providing free legal 
help 
were hoping eventually the court will order the defendants to 
repay us for the cost of the ads he said

rival shiite moslem militias began 
pulling their fighters out of beirut on saturday as the 
syrianbacked government took its first step toward consolidating 
control over lebanons capital 
militiamen of the prosyrian amal or hope and the 
iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god were each pulling forces 
from the beirut area across the city in christian east beirut 
militia of the lebanese forces under samir geagea were gathering 
to prepare for departure before the governments nov 19 deadline 
a government source said a force of 9000 soldiers under gen 
emile lahoud the governments commander would begin taking over 
greater beirut on friday the source spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the unification of beirut divided into moslem and christian 
sectors since the outbreak of the civil war in 1975 is a key 
element in a peace plan sponsored by the arab league the war has 
left at least 150000 people dead and shattered a once booming 
economy 
syrian officers and irans ambassador to damascus hassan 
akhtari were in west beirut on saturday to supervise the 
implementation of a peace accord between amal and hezbollah a 
threeyear power struggle between them has left more than 1100 
people dead 
syria with 40000 troops deployed in lebanon is the most 
powerful enforcer of the arab peace plan 
the amalhezbollah accord was reached last week in syrias 
capital damascus amal and hezbollah sources said the militias 
would exchange prisoners monday in south lebanons iqlim altuffah 
or apple province 
the government source said the army has a 500member battalion 
ready in south lebanon to move into the province after the 
withdrawal of amal and hezbollah fighters but he said the 
deployment there was not expected immediately 
the army wants first to consolidate its control over beirut 
he said 
greater beirut stretches along a 15mile coastal strip from the 
dog river in the north to the damour river in the south 
amal withdrew about 200 fighters from its south beirut 
stronghold of chiyah early saturday the bearded militiamen 
gathered near their headquarters on the beirut airport highway at 7 
am and drove out of town in 16 trucks and jeeps armed with 
twinbarrelled antiaircraft guns and recoilless cannons 
amal commander abu aly dressed in camouflage fatigues and armed 
with a 38caliber revolver said the parttime fighters who have 
their homes in beirut would remain behind but unarmed 
a police spokesman said hezbollah overnight pulled several 
militiamen from its south beirut strongholds of hay mady bir 
abed and mouawad where most of the 13 westerners missing in 
lebanon were believed held 
the conservative newspaper addiyar in an unattributed report 
said kidnappers of western hostages moved the captives out of 
south beirut to unknown hideouts two weeks ago 
earlier reports said the hostages were moved prior to the oct 
13 crackdown on rebel christian gen michel aoun by syrian and 
lebanese troops 
the 13 westerners missing in lebanon include six americans four 
britons two germans and an italian most are believed held by 
proiranian fundamentalist shiite factions affiliated with 
hezbollah 
the police spokesman who cannot be named in line with 
regulations said the hezbollah militiamen left in vans before 
daybreak for the eastern bekaa valley site of their main bases 
the christian lebanese forces militia are expected to withdraw 
from beirut to the christian hinterland of kesrouan province north 
of the capital he said 
most of druse warlord walid jumblatts progressive socialist 
party fighters have already pulled out from hills and suburbs they 
controlled on beiruts southeastern and southern edges he said

the softening of a philippine demand 
for operational control over us military bases has improved 
prospects for an agreement to keep them open diplomatic observers 
say 
us and philippine officials are optimistic that an agreement 
can be reached by january nine months before the current bases 
lease expires 
negotiators for both sides ended two days of talks on a new 
agreement friday and agreed to meet again next month 
at issue is the future of clark air base the subic bay naval 
base and four smaller installations there are 40000 troops 
defense department employees and dependents at the us facilities 
during a first round of talks in september foreign secretary 
raul manglapus chief filipino negotiator insisted on full 
sovereignty and operational control of the bases by next year 
but on friday philippine spokesman rafael alunan indicated that 
the filipinos may allow the united states to continue operating the 
bases after the current pact expires 
after 1991 we have the sovereign right to let the americans 
operate the facilities alunan said we can all presume that 
the philippine side will probably request the american side to 
continue operating those technical facilities while at the same 
time phasing in filipino and civilian personnel during the 
interim 
diplomatic sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
softening of the operational control demand significantly improved 
chances for a new agreement 
the sources said it was unclear what the philippines means by 
full sovereignty technically the philippines has maintained 
sovereignty over the bases since 1979 
although the installations are technically under philippine 
command the americans effectively run the bases 
diplomatic sources said it appeared the philippines softened the 
operational control demand because the countrys armed forces were 
not ready to run the bases 
in addition recent public opinion surveys show growing 
probases sentiment within the philippine public which apparently 
believes the country cannot afford to give up the money the 
facilities generate 
us troops from the bases were among the first rescuers during 
julys earthquake which killed more than 1600 people 
philippine authorities often turn to the us navy for help in 
rescuing victims of maritime accidents because their own navy and 
coast guard lack equipment 
sources also said several unidentified officials had told 
president corazon aquino that the governments hardline stand was 
tarnishing her administrations reputation in washington the 
philippines needs washingtons support for economic and political 
support 
any new agreement however would face an uncertain future in 
the 23member senate twothirds of the senate must ratify the 
pact and more than half the members say they want the bases closed 
next year 
bases supporters are cautiously optimistic however that some 
senators may ultimately support an agreement if the government can 
convince them that a sovereign philippines is simply hiring the 
americans to run the bases 
also all senators must face reelection in 1992 and some of 
them may be reluctant to face a generally probases electorate on a 
platform of sending the americans home

magellan ended a twoweek hiatus 
saturday and resumed its radar mapping of the surface of venus 
the lull in the spacecrafts 744 million mission was necessary 
because earth the sun and venus were lined up in a way that 
hindered communication between magellan and controllers at national 
aeronautics and space administrations jet propulsion laboratory 
magellan engineer cynthia haynie said the orbiter began bouncing 
radar waves off the cloudy planet at 411 am pst 
the radar echoes are collected by magellan for transmission to 
earth where they are assembled into maps and pictures 
everything went great haynie said 
the mapping had been suspended since oct 26 
engineers used the time to work on figuring out how to fix a 
computer programming glitch that caused magellans twin solar 
panels to wobble 
a new program to stop the wobbling will be radioed to magellan 
and activated next week said ed sherry technical assistant to 
magellans project manager 
the panels are essential for charging magellans batteries but 
the vibration hasnt prevented them from gathering solar energy 
magellan uses radar because the thick venusian clouds prevent 
optical cameras from photographing the planets surface 
the spacecraft was launched from space shuttle atlantis in may 
1989 and went into orbit around venus on aug 10 mapping began in 
september 
magellan has made pictures of volcanoes huge solidified lava 
flows extensive quake faults citysized meteorite craters and 
600milewide milehigh bulges created as molten rock pushes 
upward from inside the planet 
it also found evidence that oceansized floods of molten rock 
once inundated more than half the surface

drought has laid waste to the oncelush 
tokar delta on sudans red sea coast for the first time this 
century and the government has reportedly declared a faminestruck 
western region a disaster area 
both developments are signs the country faces a famine that 
western relief agencies say could affect millions 
the tokar deltas 400000 acres once expected to be east 
africas breadbasket have turned from rich farmland into a gray 
expanse of baked clay 
this is the first year since 1899 where there is absolutely 
nothing said the deltas chief administrative officer alfadil 
abdalla almahdi 
the delta normally irrigated by floods from the ethiopian 
plateau was chosen by british colonial rulers in 1899 for one of 
three major sudanese agriculture projects it has long been a 
showpiece spared the drought conditions that have ravaged much of 
africas largest nation 
in recent weeks the 16monthold military government has said 
the nation of more than 25 million is experiencing only a food 
gap and predicts the coming harvest will be sufficient to prevent 
widespread hardships 
it blamed the 1 million ton grain shortage largely on relief 
agencies panic buying officials have seized stocks from merchants 
and agencies to sell at subsidized prices 
but the us agency for international development and most other 
major relief organizations fear a famine beginning early 1991 
comparable to the mid1980s when hundreds of thousands of sudanese 
and ethiopians perished another 250000 to 500000 sudanese died 
in later years as southern rebels blocked food shipments and 
clashed with government troops 
last month us relief officials said as many as 8 million to 
11 million sudanese are threatened by starvation but sudans 
government is blocking international food deliveries 
if the actual level of need is as high as some people fear 
and the donor community is not allowed to respond we are looking 
at an apocalyptic situation worse than in ethiopia in 1984 said 
andrew natsios director of the office of foreign disaster 
assistance said at the time 
unless the government changes its policies there is little 
chance of anything happening in the near future to avert a 
famine richard graham wrote for the britainbased charity oxfam 
there were signs of concern even in government circles saturday 
col faisal medani mukhtar member of the nations ruling 
military junta and governor of the region was quoted saturday as 
saying that news of an imminent famine in the western region of 
kordufan was true he said the situation could be even worse next 
year 
he said there is an 80 percent crop failure in the region this 
year due to lack of rains the governor was quoted as saying 
kordufan has been declared a disaster area 
earlier last month mukhtar said his region need 300000 more 
tons of food 
people there have started to leave their homes in the area 
heading for omdurman and some other major towns in the region he 
was quoted as saying in the weekly newspaper new horizon on 
saturday 
the governor was quoted as saying his government had 
approached international agencies to provide relief aid for the 
affected people he did not say whether he received any response 
unofficial reports from the region say acute malnutrition has 
begun to spread some reports speak of deaths in the towns of 
sodary and umbader 
in places such as tokar 400 miles northeast of khartoum signs 
of a famine are unmistakeable 
herdsman hussein mohamed gassim has taken a job drawing water 
from a well to sell at up to 125 a barrel he said hes sent some 
of his goats to relatives inland in hopes they survive 
this is not a desert its the drought said gassim who 
looks much older than his 45 years this place was once as green 
as paradise itself 
sorghum the staple grain for sudanese and their animals has 
become so scarce in tokar that feeding a sheep for three days costs 
more than the animal will bring at market these days 
the selloff of livestock has lowered the price of a sheep to 
below 350 at that price a sheepherder would have to sell 50 to 
buy a 198pound sack of openmarket sorghum even a 
governmentsubsidized bag if it can be found costs 6 times the 
selling price of a sheep 
a trickle of families mainly members of the deltas beja and 
beni amir nomadic tribes who live off raising sheep goats and 
camels have begun arriving at tokar a town of 32000 
correspondents brought by the un world food program visited 
about 30 families living in a cluster of hovels made of sticks and 
sacks 
sheik adam safafay a whitebearded beja chieftain said another 
7000 of his people are living with relatives in or around tokar 
fatima nabulsa world food program field coordinator said 80 
percent of the areas livestock has been lost since 1985 
thousands of other refugees from vast western sudan have 
congregated in camps on the outskirts of khartoum 
the central governments policy however has been to play down 
threats of a possible disaster 
agriculture minister ahmed ali genaif said in early october the 
harvest would be satisfactory and promising 
the military ruler lt gen omar hassan elbashir has said 
recently he believes foreigners have exaggerated the problems in 
sudan to undermine his government

americas efforts to make aging airliners 
safer could go into a stall for lack of repair capacity the 
general accounting office says in a report 
the congressional investigative agency says federal regulations 
requiring stepped up maintenance over the next four years may 
strain the industrys limited capacity the report which became 
available saturday is to be formally presented to congress in a 
few days 
according to the airlines and repair stations we contacted 
this increased demand for repair services may not be matched by 
corresponding increases in capacity in the immediate future said 
the report 
the study was requested by the house public works and 
transportation committees aviation panel headed by rep jim 
oberstar dminn 
recent safety regulations are likely to sharply increase demand 
for shortterm repair services over the next four years the study 
said it said the changes could affect 1400 of the 4100 planes in 
the us fleet 
increased costs are expected to total 2 billion over the next 
four years the amount is equal to all of 1988 expenses to repair 
airframes it would raise by about 9 percent the current 57 
billion cost of repair and maintenance for americas airliners 
the report said the stepup is all but guaranteed to put a 
squeeze on repair capacity it said some airlines then would have 
to ground airliners ask for permission to delay repairs or fly 
them abroad for servicing 
the gao surveyed five airlines alaskan american continental 
trans world and united they account for about 39 percent of the 
us fleet it also studied four independent repair stations in 
everett wash santa barbara calif san antonio texas and 
mojave calif 
according to the report four of the five airlines expect to be 
operating near 100 percent of their hangar capacity this year it 
did say that three of the four independents expect to have excess 
capacity totaling 5 percent to 19 percent this year 
but independents represent only about 20 percent of the industry 
and that could mean excess repair capacity around 2 percent 
overall the gao said and it said even that slim margin could be 
squeezed one repair station serviced 139 large transport craft in 
1989 while turning away 153 others

in another step away from moscow latvia says it 
will punish people who did not go to work on revolution day a 
major holiday throughout the soviet union a newspaper reported on 
saturday 
another baltic republic lithuania plans to issue its own 
passports according to reports 
according to soviet interior minister vadim bakatin more than 9 
million people took part in parades in various cities on wednesday 
in observance of revolution day the anniversary of the 1917 
bolshevik revolution 
however in the baltics and some other republics pushing for 
independence from the soviet union local authorities tried to 
squelch celebrations of the holiday which they see as a symbol of 
soviet power 
latvias justice minister announced friday that workers who 
stayed home on wednesday will be subject to disciplinary measures 
and some industrial bosses may be prosecuted the soviet government 
newspaper izvestia said 
regardless of the burden on prosecutors the republic will find 
a way to handle the cases izvestia quoted justice minister viktor 
skudra as saying on latvian television the newspaper said it was 
not clear how many cases there were 
izvestia also reported that lithuania which in march became the 
first republic to declare independence has designed a new passport 
that meets international standards for size and shape 
by decision of the republics parliament soviet passports 
gradually will be replaced by the lithuanian ones the newspaper 
said 
izvestia did not say when the passports would be issued or 
whether lithuanians would be required to carry them 
it did say that morally a lithuanian should give up his soviet 
passport before accepting a lithuanian one which would mean he 
could not travel abroad unless the lithuanian document is accepted 
by other countries 
nearly all 15 soviet republics have launched some kind of 
movement for autonomy or independence from central authorities in 
moscow

the state board of education on saturday 
approved science textbooks that teach the theory of evolution 
despite objections from those who say alternative views get short 
shrift 
textbooks for texas schools have long been a point of contention 
between supporters of evolution theory and creationists who 
ascribe the origin of species to acts of god as described in the 
bible 
texas as one of the nations largest purchasers of textbooks 
influences what publishers put in the books 
these are the best biology textbooks that have ever been 
presented to the public schools of this state said board member 
will davis after the books were approved 114 
but board member jane nelson said most of the books offer 
insufficient evidence rebutting evolution theory or suggesting 
flaws in the theory the board had asked publishers to include such 
evidence she said 
i feel that this boards integrity is at stake ms nelson 
said 
the theory of evolution holds that existing species of plants 
and animals developed from earlier forms through hereditary 
transmission of slight variations in successive generations 
i dont think the issue is that we want to put religion in the 
biology textbooks ms nelson said i just want to give enough 
information for the teachers to use to show that we havent proven 
the theory of evolution 
i think when we have a 1000page textbook it doesnt hurt 
to have a page in there presenting alternative theories said 
chairman monte hasie who also opposed the books 
the science books approved by the state board are for first 
through 12th grades they will be used for six years 
the state previously has limited coverage of evolution in 
biology textbooks said michael hudson general counsel of people 
for the american way the civil rights group has lobbied for 
expanded coverage of evolution in science textbooks 
students in every state will benefit from the texas 
decision hudson said adopting science books that adequately 
present evolution will help reverse the recent trend toward 
scientific illiteracy among american students 
elizabeth judge executive director of a houstonbased textbook 
review group said the decision marks the end of the dark ages 
and the beginning of an enlightenment for science in texas

a kuwaiti doctor said saturday he 
helped bury more than 50 kuwaiti babies who died after the iraqis 
halted their hospital care and in some cases pulled the plugs on 
their incubators 
dr ali alhuwail 36 a neurologist and chief of the 
outpatient department at the kuwaiti armed forces hospital said 
he fled his homeland last week 
iraq has organized two trips to occupied kuwait for western 
media in an attempt to rebut charges that iraqis have looted the 
country and abused the kuwaiti population since the aug 2 
invasion 
alhuwail said the trips were a sham at a news conference 
organized by the kuwaiti ministry of information in exile 
alhuwail and three egyptian doctors who had lived in kuwait said 
the iraqis have destroyed health care robbed homes and hospitals 
and beaten and tortured innocent civilians 
alhuwail said 60 to 70 children died at the gynecology and 
obstetrics hospital in kuwait city after the iraqis dismantled the 
premature infant unit in some cases the iraqis pulled the plugs 
on their incubators he said 
with a colleague who has also left kuwait he said he buried 
more than 50 of the children in the middle of the night at a 
cemetery he said this took place about aug 20 less than three 
weeks after iraqi troops invaded 
during one trip organized by iraq western reporters were 
allowed to walk into the supposedly sterile premature baby unit 
where three babies were in one room and two in another the doctor 
claimed 
the rest of the incubators were just jammed on one side 
thrown in one corner in a storeroom he said it doesnt 
take much to realize why these are not connected 
alhuwail said the iraqis forced him to speak with the 
reporters telling him it was not in his best interests to 
remain silent he said he spoke in vague terms 
one of the egyptian doctors at the news conference samir 
motawy chairman of medical oncology at the kuwait cancer center 
said chemotherapy drugs blood components and whole blood were 
almost nonexistent in midoctober as a result he said leukemia 
and other cancer patients were dying

an illinois army reservist was discharged 
saturday and excused from duty in the persian gulf after saying she 
was a conscientious objector officials said 
spc stephanie atkinson is the first reservist thats been 
placed on active duty who has refused to report said her 
attorney tod ensign director of new yorkbased citizen soldier 
atkinson who had been interned since nov 2 was released from 
house arrest at fort knox on saturday said master sgt ken 
distler a base spokesman atkinsons mother picked up her daughter 
and they left he said 
military authorities on friday approved atkinsons discharge 
under other than honorable conditions the most adverse of the 
three possible discharges in such circumstances said fort knox 
spokeswoman laurie viggiano 
the army however does not recognize atkinson as a conscientous 
objector instead they allowed her to be discharged in order to 
avoid a lengthy and costly court martial the spokeswoman said 
the 23yearold murphysboro ill resident was a postal clerk 
with the 300th adjutant general postal company the unit got notice 
oct 15 that it was to go on active duty but atkinson was not with 
the group when it left for the persian gulf on oct 30 
she said she thought the us military was in the persian gulf 
solely for economic reasons 
the army formally charged atkinson earlier friday with desertion 
and missing movement to an overseas assignment viggiano said in 
order to avoid a lengthy proceeding atkinson requested a 
discharge for the good of the service 
if she had been convicted at a court martial atkinson could 
have faced a dishonorable discharge a fiveyear prison sentence or 
demotion to the armys lowest rank 
other groups are rallying behind the resistance last week the 
national conference of vietnam veterans ministers met in 
washington dc to denounce the military buildup in the gulf 
the rev r michael stuart with the presbyterian church usa 
global mission unit was in louisville to support atkinson he 
handed out a statement from the ministers group that read war 
does cruel violence to humanity war dehumanizes both ourselves and 
our enemies war thrusts upon us the low morality of mere 
survival 
atkinsons case is similar to one in hawaii in which a marine is 
awaiting courtmartial for refusing to go to saudi arabia 
cpl jeffery paterson is seeking conscientious objector status 
and has been charged with unauthorized absence and disobeying 
orders he has been restricted to the kaneohe marine corps air 
station since a federal judge ordered him released from the brig on 
sept 21

the pineapple express swelled rivers in northwest washington 
state to near record floods levels saturday causing hundreds of 
evacuations and a tornado skipped across hatteras island off north 
carolina knocking out power 
the gulf coast also got walloped as windwhipped seas caused 
offshore accidents from texas to alabama 
despite the pounding from disparate weather systems across the 
nation just one death was reported an unidentified crewman on 
friday died after he fell off a ship in the gulf 
near biloxi miss winddriven seas threw a double barge into 
the walter l nixon bridge knocking a few pilings loose officials 
said the bridge which connects a coastal highway with interstate 
10 will be closed indefinitely 
wind kicked up friday morning across the louisiana coast 
offshore winds ran up to 40 mph and gusted higher by saturday 
the winds had slowed and seas were subsiding 
a 98foot shrimper lost power about 10 miles south of gulfport 
miss and was wedged underneath an oil platform in 10foot seas 
four crewmen were rescued friday and the ship was anchored in a 
nearby gas field 
at the mouth of the mississippi river a 75foot trawler was 
pounded to splinters as its crew watched from a passing pleasure 
craft that picked them up 
in washington the downpour began to subside but hundreds of 
people were evacuated unable to reach their homes or isolated by 
floodwaters in rural areas from the snoqualmie valley east of 
seattle to southwestern british columbia more than 100 miles to 
the north 
a helicopter was called in to pluck one elderly woman from her 
trailer home said mike razey an emergency services spokesman 
national guard amphibious vehicles were being used to get people 
out of sumas on the canadian border said bill quehrn a spokesman 
for the whatcom county department of emergency services 
theres about 200 people in sumas who feel theyre not safe 
there and who want to get out he said 
numerous highways were closed by high water slides and 
washouts 
county officials estimated the number of people evacuated 
unable to reach their homes or isolated by flooding at 300 to 500 
in whatcom county 150 in skagit county 50 to 70 in snohomish 
county and 10 in king county 
no injuries or major damage was reported but officials were 
keeping a wary eye on dikes levees and a few key bridges 
it looks like we could get through with minimal damage 
depending on the next weather system we get said dave brookings 
assistant flood control engineer in skagit county 
if dikes along the skagit river become soggy and unstable the 
whole lower basin is going to be vulnerable brookings said if 
we have a dike failure that could be a disaster 
the national weather service reported seven rivers cresting 
within a foot of flood levels the cedar at renton the skykomish 
at gold bar the snoqualmie at carnation the snohomish at 
snohomish the stillaguamish at arlington the skagit at concrete 
and the nooksack at deming 
the deluge resulted from what forecasters call the pineapple 
express a fall storm track that carries warm moist weather 
systems from hawaii to the pacific northwest 
the north carolina twister ripped roofs off homes and downed 
power lines and trees but no serious injuries were reported said 
graham wilson spokesman for the state division of crime control 
and public safety 
ferry service to the island the only way of reaching the outer 
banks had been suspended because of winds gusting up to 78 mph 
said tabitha hooper at the hatteras ferry office service was 
restored about noon 
the only road linking hatteras to the mainland via bogue 
island was ripped apart two weeks ago when a dredge broke loose 
from its moorings in a gale and smashed into the herbert c bonner 
bridge severing the 2mile span 
its something every week if its not tornadoes its 
hurricane warnings ms hooper said 
about half the islands 5000 residents lost electricity after 
saturdays storm just about a week after getting power restored 
following the bridge collapse officials said power should be back 
on by sunday afternoon 
wilson said the bridge accident could have helped emergency 
management authorities cope with this weatherrelated accident 
we already had those generators over on hatteras so that 
could at least be one positive thing he said

the government announced saturday it 
will cut off energy to some inefficient state industries and reduce 
power supplies to others as romania braces for a harsh winter on 
low oil reserves 
the government also reassured the public deprived of winter 
heating for years under the dictatorship of the late nicolae 
ceausescu that homes would not be cold this season 
all these measures will be carried out without affecting the 
supply of electricity and heating and other fuel to the population 
over the winter it said in a statement broadcast on state 
television 
the statement said the government had to cut off other supplies 
however because the countrys hard currency resources can no 
longer support the current levels of energy consumption 
it said construction sites and some mines and other moneylosing 
enterprises would not receive any winter energy supplies 
effectively closing them down 
the government did not say whether the industries would have to 
continue to pay their workers unemployment is currently estimated 
at 10 percent 
other industries such as transportation services would receive 
10 percent less energy than planned the government statement said 
saturdays announcement came after premier petre roman called an 
emergency meeting of ministers and state bank officials to discuss 
the worsening energy situation 
officials blamed the situation on a 20 percent drop in 
electricity production and depleted oil supplies due to the persian 
gulf crisis the statement also cited widespread fuel pilfering 
from industrial sites

public by the cambodia news agency spk said the un force in 
cambodia should not be a fighting unit armed with heavy weapons 
and it should not have the character of a peacekeeping force 
a us diplomat has said the un force could involve as many as 
10000 peacekeeping troops and 10000 administrators but the 
memorandum said the un role should be defined by cambodias 
supreme national council 
the council consists of six members of the phnom penh government 
and six of the threefaction guerrilla coalition opposing it it 
has not met since september because of a dispute over who will 
chair the council

authority to organize elections in a neutral political 
atmosphere but the newly elected government alone should resolve 
any remaining military problems it said 
neither the cambodian government nor its three guerrilla enemies 
were present at the jakarta meeting 
indonesian foreign minister ali alatas said the cambodians were 
absent because we in the preliminary stages need more input 
suggestions and recommendations from those who have been actively 
engaged in the preparation of the un plan

renew their talks to make sure the paris meeting is fruitful and 
leads to the signing of a final peace plan

transients to cover up a cattletheft scheme with her husband 
a livingston county jury deliberated 2 hours before convicting 
faye copeland 
the nineday trials penalty phase is scheduled for monday when 
the jury will decide whether she should be executed or sentenced to 
life in prison

hands and sobbed saying i never done nothing 
the families of the victims and the citizens of our state have 
received partial vindication said assistant attorney general 
kenny hulshof 
defense attorneys had no comment after the verdict 
mrs copelands lawyers attempted to paint her as a dominated 
woman who did not actively participate in the killings but 
prosecutors said she was a willing participant 
faye copeland is a victim of the truth hulshof said 
during closing arguments 
hulshof told the jury that a letter mrs copeland wrote to her 
jailed husband shortly after their arrests in october 1989 pointed 
to her guilt 
referring to police using bulldozers in a search for bodies on 
their 40acre farm near chillicothe in rural northwest missouri

in a well all had been shot in the head

copelands as 20th century cattle rustlers he said the 
copelands made a 32000 profit from cattle purchased by the men 
most of whom were hired by ray copeland at missions 
many of the victims clothes and other personal items were 
seized from the farm couples home authorities said mrs copeland 
made rags and quilts from the clothing 
mrs copeland looking thin and frail frequently dabbed at 
tears with a tissue and seldom looked up during the trial she took 
the stand friday but said she did not wish to testify

ease the discomfort from the hard wooden benches

a protest movement demanding the 
removal of leftist military commanders spread saturday with 
protesters occupying public buildings and holding hostage a former 
sandinista official and four other people 
former contra rebels attacked a police station friday with ak47 
assault rifles in nueva guinea 190 miles southeast of managua 
four people were reported dead and 34 wounded 
members of president violeta chamorros united national 
opposition coalition seized the government telecommunications 
office and staged sitins friday night and saturday at several 
police stations in la concepcion 20 miles southeast of managua 
it became the 17th town to join the civic movement to save 
democracy which remains largely confined to the eastern and 
southeastern parts of the country with the outbreak of protest in 
la conception the movement came the closest yet to managua the 
capital 
the protesters in took hostage socorro galan who headed the 
committee of friendship with socialist countries under the 
sandinista government along with galans brother and three 
policemen 
they blocked the entrances to the town with huge felled trees 
and were demanding to speak with chamorro vice president virgilio 
godoy or archbiship miguel obando y bravo said oscar melendez a 
spokesman for the demonstrators 
we have no weapons only rocks and machetes and the power of 
god said felix pedro calero a young man manning a barricade 
the protesters were demanding a local military base be closed 
here and that guns be taken away from about 150 sandinista 
cooperative farmers who have provoked the people in the area 
melendez said 
like demonstrators around the country the protesters in la 
concepcion want mrs chamorros conservative usbacked 
government to take control of the military away from the 
sandinistas mrs chamorro defeated former sandinista president 
daniel ortega in february elections 
but ortegas brother gen humberto ortega also a sandinista 
is still commander of the military and the demonstrators want him 
fired 
fridays firefight in nueva guinea left three former rebels dead 
and 35 people wounded including nine policemen authorities later 
said one of the wounded died friday night but the victim was not 
immediately identified 
five of 21 people arrested in nueva guinea were held on weapons 
charges the rest were released for lack of evidence 
interior minister carlos hurtado said the shooting incident was 
not related to the civic movement to save democracy but members of 
the group began acting 10 days ago to back demands by the former 
contras for land and economic aid the chamorro administration 
promised them when they demobilized earlier this year 
the usbacked rebels fought for a decade to overthrow the 
sandinistas contra leaders had demanded that the sandinistas be 
removed from command of the armed forces police and other security 
agencies but mrs chamorro refused after she took office 
some observers said she allowed the sandinistas to maintain some 
authority to mollify them as the new opposition and keep them from 
trying to take power again by force 
mrs chamorro pressured the contras into disarming and 
demobilizing promising them land and other economic aid but this 
has been slow in coming 
the former rebels last week set up barricades on the rama road 
the main highway linking eastern and western nicaragua to demand 
promised assistance the roadblock remained in place saturday 
mrs chamorro has been trying to get the 17 town mayors to come 
to managua to talk matters over so far without success 
the protest movement also continued saturday in bluefields 
nicaraguas main port on the caribbean where demonstrators 
controlled the regional government building the local television 
and a radio station 
in boaco 60 miles east of the capital protesters were also 
holding the telecommunications office and the agency that regulates 
aqueducts running water and sewage services 
the demonstrators this week also demanded the removal of antonio 
lacayo minister of the presidency whom they accuse of cozying up 
to the sandinistas 
lacayo is mrs chamorros soninlaw and her private secretary 
and is considered the man who wields most power in the government 
nicaraguas 11 roman catholic bishops issued a statement friday 
supporting the protest movement the countrys largest association 
of business leaders is also backing it

mikhail s gorbachev transformed 
from eastern europes liberator to a leader in desperate search of 
rich benefactors wrapped up his visit to germany on saturday with 
no clear reply to his pleas 
thousands of germans cheered the kremlin chief as he toured 
german wine country with chancellor helmut kohl they gave him 
lavish thanks for letting the berlin wall fall and germany unite 
at one point on the tour kohl pledged that germany would help 
gorbachevs troubled nation as it tries to avoid economic collapse 
but kohl gave no specifics and there did not appear to be a 
change in german caution about increasing the financial assistance 
already promised 
we wish you success in your reform policies kohl said in 
remarks outside his home in the town of oggersheim near the end of 
gorbachevs visit we will help within the framework of our 
abilities 
gorbachev in turn thanked kohl and mentioned the long and 
difficult road both countries had traveled to reach their current 
state of increasingly warm relations 
earlier hansdietrich genscher the german foreign minister 
said germany must help the soviet union but that aiding moscow is 
not solely a german responsibility 
gorbachev returned to moscow late saturday at home he faces 
ominous problems including huge losses in popularity but 
thousands of germans gave him a heros welcome as he wrapped up a 
twoday visit 
thank you gorby read one placard in the cathedral town of 
speyer which gorbachev and kohl visited 
another man held up a sign written in russian saying we wish 
you happiness mikhail still another read good luck gorby 
gorbachev his wife raisa kohl and kohls wife hannelore 
toured speyers 11th century imperial cathedral where eight german 
emperors are buried 
gorbachev plunged into the crowd several times accepting 
flowers and shaking hands with the crowd which chanted gorby 
gorby and helmut helmut 
he did a lot for us and we are grateful to the germans 
too said adolf fries a sovietgerman who was allowed to 
emigrate from kazakhstan two years ago and now works as a driver in 
speyer 
earlier in the day in bonn gorbachev met separately with 
genscher and with hansjochen vogel head of the opposition social 
democrats 
former west german chancellor willy brandt like gorbachev a 
nobel peace prize laureate canceled a meeting with the soviet 
leader saying he was too tired after a hostagefreeing trip to 
baghdad 
vogel said he talked with gorbachev about the persian gulf 
crisis which began with iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait he said 
gorbachev insisted all means must be exhausted to reach a 
peaceful solution to the crisis 
vogel was asked whether gorbachev said he thought military 
action might be needed 
he did not rule that out vogel told reporters 
so far there has been no indication from moscow that soviet 
troops would definitely take part in such an action although 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze said last week that 
force was acceptable as a last resort 
during the tour through rhinelandpalatinate kohl renewed his 
pledge that germany would help the soviet union with badly needed 
financial assistance but kohl named no sums and gave no timeframe 
we know that on this difficult path to german unity you were 
with us you helped us and we are grateful kohl said in a brief 
speech in the village of deidesheim where the two leaders ate 
lunch 
within the scope of our possibilities we will help you kohl 
told gorbachev as the deidesheim townspeople dressed in folk 
costumes cheered 
gorbachev drew strong applause when he kissed the local wine 
queen

the 1991 budget to make overdue payments to international lenders 
prime minister juan hurtado miller says

foreign lenders since he took power on july 28 relations were 
suspended in 1988 when former president alan garcia cut off 
payments on perus 20 billion foreign debt 
hurtado also said on friday that the government plans to 
introduce a new tax system on jan 1 that will expand the tax base 
and simplify rates 
the overdue debt payments will go to the international monetary 
fund the world bank and the interamerican development bank said 
hurtado who also is economy minister 
peru hopes the payments will allow it to obtain about 750 
million in new loans from the institutions he said 
the 1991 budget is expected to be approved by congress this 
week about 30 percent of the budget will go to service domestic 
and foreign debt 
as part of the tax reform perus 68 tax brackets will be 
reduced to no more than seven and millions of peruvians who now 
pay no taxes will be included in the system hurtado said only

libyan strongman moammar gadhafi says 
his country has a right to produce poison gas a german magazine 
reported saturday 
the weekly der spiegel also said gadhafi is asking for 
restitution for mines planted by the german army on libyan 
territory during world war ii 
gadhafi wants to soon demand restitution for the countless 
mines that gen erwin rommels afrikakorps planted in the desert 
which still today kill and injure libyan people spiegel said 
we need you german experts to finally free us of this 
plague spiegel quoted gadhafi as saying in an interview that 
will appear in its monday editions 
excerpts of the interview which were provided early to other 
news media did not say how many libyans had been reputedly killed 
or injured by the mines 
gadhafi in the past has also demanded restitution from italy for 
mines planted along the mediterranean coast of libya during the 
war italy has refused to pay 
spiegel asked gadhafi about allegations his country has produced 
poison gas 
why are americans and israelis allowed to produce chemical 
weapons and nuclear bombs but not libya doesnt libya have the 
right to defend itself spiegel quoted gadhafi as saying 
the united states in late 1988 accused german companies of 
helping gadhafi build a poison gas plant in rabta 60 miles south 
of tripoli 
germany at first denied the charges but in may 1989 juergen 
hippenstielimhausen head of the imhausenchemie company was 
arrested for his links to the rabta plant 
hippenstielimhausen was tried and found guilty of violating 
german export laws for helping libya build the plant he was 
sentenced to five years in prison in june 
gadhafis government has repeatedly denied the plant was for 
production of poison gas it said the facility was for 
pharmaceuticals 
despite the denials us officials said in march that libya is 
producing limited amounts of mustard and nerve gases apparently 
intended for use as chemical weapons 
spiegel also said gadhafi predicted catastrophic results if 
war breaks out in the middle east 
it quoted gadhafi as saying that to prevent such a conflict 
iraq should withdraw from kuwait and the united states should pull 
out of saudi arabia 
a un force made up of arabic military units should be used to 
secure the area the magazine quoted gadhafi as saying

a federal appeals court on saturday upheld an 
injunction barring cable news network from broadcasting tapes of 
manuel noriegas telephone conversations with his lawyers 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals also called on the 
atlantabased network to produce the seven tapes in us district 
court in miami so the court could decide whether the broadcasts 
would endanger noriegas right to a fair trial on drugtrafficking 
charges 
the ruling came after cnn on friday defied judge william 
hoeveler in miami broadcasting excerpts from the tapes minutes 
after the judge issued an order instructing the network not to do 
so 
cnn said it would appeal saturdays ruling to the us supreme 
court 
we will be pursuing an immediate appeal cnn spokesman steve 
haworth said in a telephone interview haworth said he didnt know 
yet if cnn would continue televising excerpts of the tapes 
the appeals panel denied cnns appeal of hoevelers 10day 
injunction against broadcasting excerpts of noreigas phone calls 
from federal jail 
it called on the network to produce the tapes in hoevelers 
courtroom so that the trial judge can determine if noriegas sixth 
amendment rights to a fair trial have been violated by the us 
government and cnn 
the first amendment interests of the press and public will 
best be served by immediate production of the tapes held by cnn so 
that the district court can conduct the difficult balancing of 
constititional rights the appeals court said 
cnn has shackled the district court by refusing that courts 
reasonable request to review the audiotapes it has in its 
possession the court said 
the justice department on saturday morning filed a brief with 
the appeals court claiming the tapes could make it difficult to 
select an unbiased jury for noriegas trial 
noriegas right to a fair trial and effective counsel also could 
be compromised if details of the defense strategy are revealed to 
prosecutors the brief said 
the government cannot at this point be more specific with 
respect to the possible harm that could flow from publication of 
the tapes because the government like the district court does not 
know the contents of the materials cnn has in its possession the 
brief states 
on friday hoeveler said he would hold cnn in contempt of court 
if it disregarded his order but in an unusual interview with cnn 
outside the courtroom friday night the judge said he could not 
rule on contempt without a prosecutors motion 
on saturday afternoon noriega attorney frank rubino asked 
hoeveler to find cnn in direct civil contempt and fine the network 
300000 for each time it had televised the tapes and each time it 
shows them in future 
before hoeveler could respond cnn attorney terry beinstock 
asked the judge to disqualify himself accusing the judge of 
revealing a personal bias against the network in the cnn interview 
on friday night 
in the interview a cnn reporter asked hoeveler if he planned to 
find cnn in contempt 
that remains to be seen the judge said asked why the 
judge replied well somebodys going to have to move for that 
and they cnn obviously are in contempt at the moment the legal 
proceedings will take place when somebody moves for sanctions 
in miami federal district chief judge james lawrence king said 
saturday the motion seeking to disqualify hoeveler from 
consideration of the contempt issue will be handled in the 
orderly manner prescribed for such situations he would not 
comment further 
a tape cnn played friday contained a brief conversation in 
spanish between noriega and rubinos secretary said to be acting 
as a translator for the englishspeaking defense team 
cnn provided an onscreen english translation and narration in 
english that made it impossible to hear the actual exchange 
cnn said the secretary told noriega two people have been 
arrested in panama and says he should determine whatever they can 
know about you 
noriega says he knows only one of the people 
it is very interesting because it shows their strategy cnn 
translated noriega as saying it says they are trying to induce 
any of the two of them to testify before the court against me 
the men apparently referred to in the tape were felipe camargo 
a noriega loyalist now imprisoned in panama who had been the 
generals top liaison with the cubans and alfredo sanchez whom 
the miami herald identified saturday as a convicted drug smuggler 
once employed by the us defense intelligence agency 
other tapes played friday included conversations between noriega 
and his supporters including a discussion with his mistress 
mother about the transfer of 4 million cnn said 
noriega is accused of accepting 46 million in bribes from 
colombias medellin cocaine cartel in exchange for letting drugs 
move safely through panama to the united states 
he has been held at the metropolitan correctional center outside 
miami since shortly after surrendering to us soldiers who invaded 
his country in december

a us district court jury has awarded 27 
million to three sheriffs deputies who claimed a male officer 
demanded sex in exchange for favorable work reviews 
in making the award friday the court also ruled that the santa 
clara county sheriffs department and several officials did not do 
enough to discourage the ongoing harassment 
the deputies zana murphy cynthia bates and toni daugherty 
filed the lawsuit in 1985 charging sheriffs officials with 
failure to investigate their complaints against deputy craig 
nelson 
the three said nelson made lewd comments and sexual advances 
while he was their training officer at the county jail 
the department suspended nelson for 14 days but the harassment 
continued in the form of anonymous obscene phone calls and rumors 
about the womens sexual habits said byron wells a lawyer for the 
women 
nelson who works for the county department of corrections was 
dropped as a defendant this year after his insurance company agreed 
to pay 150000 
the county is considering whether to appeal said susan 
levenberg chief deputy county counsel 
county lawyers had argued that the sheriffs department was not 
responsible for nelsons action and that officials took quick and 
immediate response

the san francisco board of supervisors protested to the us 
automaker last month after learning that the video made to be 
shown only to gm personnel referred to a japanesemade vehicle as 
a little faggot truck 
the use of the term violated a city human rights ordinance 
because it is a slur against homosexuals the supervisors said 
they threatened to cancel a 500000 city contract with gm 
gm chairman robert stempel wrote back assuring the supervisors 
that this singular unfortunate incident does not reflect general 
motors policy toward lesbian and gay people 
the excerpt is offensive and therefore had no place in

chandra shekhar a socialist was sworn 
in as indias eighth prime minister saturday he will lead a 
country wracked by religious and caste violence with its weakest 
government ever 
president ramaswamy venkataraman administered the oath in a 
10minute midday ceremony on the redgravel courtyard of the 
presidential palace 
chandra shekhar 63 replaces vp singh who lost the prime 
ministers job after a hindu rightwing party defected from his 
coalition government because of singhs opposition to a project to 
tear down a moslem mosque 
chandra shekhars government controls about 60 seats in the 
522member lower house of parliament 
he will rely on the support of the congress party the largest 
in the house with 195 seats congress leader and former prime 
minister rajiv gandhi refused to form a government or join chandra 
shekar in a formal coalition 
this government will last only as long as congress wants it 
to united news of india quoted singh as saying as he left the 
ceremony 
gandhi whose fiveyear tenure as prime minister was brought to 
an end by singh almost a year ago watched with a smile from the 
crowd of vips during the nationally televised ceremony 
hindumoslem violence has wracked the country which already was 
reeling under a succession of riots and selfimmolation suicides by 
uppercaste hindu students angered by singhs attempts to reserve 
more jobs for lower castes 
chandra shekhar and devi lal led a breakaway faction of singhs 
own janata dal party in joining the swelling chorus of opposition 
devi lal 76 was sworn in as deputy prime minister immediately 
after chandra shekhar took his oath 
no other ministers were appointed chandra shekhar is expected 
to present his full cabinet to parliament for endorsement by nov 
20 
by backing chandra shekhar at least for the moment gandhi can 
wait for less turbulent times before making a fresh election bid to 
reclaim the prime ministers job his family held for most of the 
past 43 years 
gandhis grandfather was indias first prime minister when 
britain relinquished colonial rule in 1947 and gandhi succeeded 
his slain mother indira gandhi as prime minister in 1984 
venkataraman whose job is mostly ceremonial asked three other 
parties to try to form a government before turning to chandra 
shekhar 
the new prime minister who dropped his family surname of singh 
decades ago because it identified him as uppercaste is a veteran 
politician but has never held a top government post he has been 
elected to parliament four times from three different parties in 
the last 28 years 
more than 370 people have died in riots and police shootings in 
the past three weeks because of the hindu fundamentalist campaign 
to replace a moslem mosque with a temple in the hindu holy town of 
ayodhya 
in karachi pakistan on saturday hundreds of moslem 
fundamentalists demonstrated near the indian consulate to protest 
the indian governments decision to reopen ayodhya to hindu 
pilgrims last week police fired tear gas and charged the crowd 
with steeltipped batons injuring at least one person authorities 
said 
in another crisis 150 uppercaste hindus have committed suicide 
or died in clashes with police in protests of singhs decision to 
reserve nearly half of government jobs for lowercaste hindus 
so far this year sikh extremists in punjab have killed nearly 
2700 people higher than the annual death toll in any of gandhis 
five years in office 
another 1500 people have died in jammukashmir where moslem 
militants was to secede from india 
while 82 percent of indias 880 million people are hindu sikhs 
hold a slight majority over hindus in punjab and moslems make up 
nearly twothirds of the population of jammukashmir

albanian premier adil carcani has called 
on the people of his hardline communist nation to work harder to 
pull the country out of economic crisis the state news agency 
reported saturday 
according to a dispatch monitored in vienna carcani 
acknowledged in a natioally televised address that the economy was 
facing numerous difficulties he said the problems were mainly 
caused by drought and a shortage of energy supplies that will force 
the government to continue to increase imports 
carcanis admission of problems in the centrally planned economy 
was another sign of greater openness in the balkan nation 
according to a report by the albanian news agency ata he said 
albanians should with a high spirit of responsibility and sharp 
discipline intensify their efforts for the strengthening of the 
economy 
carcani acknowledged there have also been interruptions of 
work and a considerable number of workers are paid with only 80 
percent of their wages 
grain and potato production targets had not been reached he 
said but the government will make up the difference by increasing 
imports 
albania has resisted most of the social and democratic reforms 
that have swept other eastern european countries 
it has embraced some changes however 
president ramiz alia last week told the partys central 
committee that albania should rethink enshrining in the 
constitution the communists guaranteed leading role and 
official atheism but he demanded order in the country and rejected 
foreign prescriptions for reform 
the government said four months ago it would grant passports to 
albanians after thousands stormed western embassies in tirana the 
capital and were allowed to leave the country alia said recently 
however that rules for passports had not been finalized

for alleged safety and health violations at its chemical plant 
where an explosion in july killed two workers and injured 17 
investigators from the occupational safety and health 
administration have recommended a fine of 1061100 for 133 
citations they issued against the company because of the july 19 
accident which closed the plant 
among the alleged safety infractions were explosive elements 
stored sidebyside unmarked exits and a failure to tell workers 
about potential hazards 
the explosion did an estimated 50 million damage to the plant 
which handled resins used in paints and coatings for aluminum food 
cans 
the investigation blamed the blast on excessive pressure in a 
reactor vessel in a resin plant part of the vessel fractured 
spewing flammable liquid and vapors into the air said osha area

fine is due 30 days after that

while pablo picasso never visited the united 
states the us government kept an extensive secret dossier on him 
for 27 years because it considered him a possible subversive the 
new york times reported in its sunday editions 
both the fbi and the state department kept track of the 
spanishborn artist monitoring what he wrote said and signed his 
whereabouts and his affiliations the times reported 
the newspaper said the fbi still maintains a picasso file 
although the artist died 17 years ago at the age of 91 picasso 
spent most of his life in france 
the documents show that us officials worried about the effect 
picasso who joined the french communist party in 1944 might have 
on public opinion in the united states the newspaper said 
the article was written by author herbert mitgang whose 1989 
book dangerous dossiers examined the fbis practice of 
maintaining files on leading writers residing in the united states 
including nobel laureates sinclair lewis ernest hemingway william 
faulkner and john steinbeck 
mitgang said he obtained the picasso files 2 years after 
requesting them under the freedom of information act he said some 
pages in the files were withheld and others had paragraphs blacked 
out 
the fbi labeled picasso as a security matter c for 
communist and as a possible subversive the newspaper said 
it said fbi director j edgar hoover initially took notice of 
picasso when the artist wrote a statement in 1944 titled why i 
became a communist in which he wrote my joining the communist 
party is a logical step in my life my work and gives them 
meaning 
additions to the picasso file grew smaller in the 1960s but his 
name appeared in fbi references up to 1971 the newspaper said 
mitgang said that to find out more about picassos politics he 
spoke to a friend of the artist dominique desanti who was active 
in the french resistance 
mrs desanti who teaches at new york university told mitgang 
that picasso was a communist but not a partyline communist he 
never attended his cell meetings in vallauris the little town in 
france where he lived if there was a meeting they came to 
him 
had he known the fbi was watching him he would have laughed 
his head off mrs desanti said he might have put on a mask 
makers red nose and made jokes about it no doubt he would think 
such an absurd thing was surrealistic

vitevitch debris from the cessna 421 aircraft was spotted in a 
mangrove swamp in southwestern florida on saturday 
the victims names were being withheld until search crews could 
reach the wreckage probably on sunday officials said 
the private aircraft took off friday from key west headed for 
naples in southwest florida vitevitch said friends waiting for 
its arrival in naples called authorities when it failed to arrive 
the crew of a commercial airliner reported seeing a fireball in 
the sky at 247 pm friday and radar tapes show the cessnas 
transponder quit sending signals at that time vitevitch said a 
transponder sends radio signals automatically 
the cause of the explosion was unknown and there were no 
immediate clues lt robin kane said 
no one talked to them before the crash he said they had 
no communication with anyone so we really dont know what 
happened 
officials said a coast guard helicopter had spotted a wing and 
smaller debris in a mangrove swamp about 5 miles north of cape 
sable which is situated 75 miles southeast of naples

daddy killed the twin peaks homecoming queen 
at least thats how it seemed 
abc had promised to solve laura palmers murder in saturday 
nights episode which comes during television sweeps of its weird 
and wild series set in a logging town in the pacific northwest 
of course creators david lynch and mark frost didnt make it 
neat leland palmer was not arrested for his daughters murder and 
he seems about to kill again in fact somebody else was hauled off 
to jail 
in fact fbi agent dale cooper and sheriff harry s truman 
havent solved the murder though theres a chance cooper will 
properly interpret a vision he has seen and save lauras cousin 
from death at the hands of leland who apparently is also the 
bob that fans have known is the killer or a spirit who moves 
the killer or something 
earlier in the episode benjamin horn just minutes after 
telling his own daughter he was in love with laura was dragged off 
to the sherrifs station for questioning in lauras murder 
benjamin the debonaire but dastardly dad was always a good 
candidate for killer what with his ownership of a brothel his 
sexual wanderings and dealings with drug dealers 
twin peaks could use a boost in the ratings the solution 
could generate according to the latest ac nielsen co numbers 
the series was third in its time period last week with a 79 
rating and a 16 share 
a rating point equals 931000 television households a share is 
the percentage of television sets in use in the time period that 
are turned to the show

children born to diabetic mothers run a 
significant chance of being severely overweight at age 8 even 
though they tend to be of normal size at age 1 a new study says 
the reason for the childhood obesity is a mystery dr bernard 
silverman says 
but the the risk may be reduced if the mother keeps tight rein 
on her blood sugar levels during pregnancy he said 
about half the 8yearolds from diabetic pregnancies in the 
study weighed more than 90 percent of typical american children at 
that age 
theyre enormously obese said silverman a pediatrician at 
childrens memorial hospital in chicago 
we assume they are at risk for developing the problems that 
other obese populations are at risk for such as high blood 
pressure and heart disease he said but it will be years and 
years before we can tell that 
most mothers of children in the study had developed diabetes 
during pregnancy which is called gestational diabetes the other 
mothers were diabetic beforehand 
diabetes is a disorder of high blood sugar almost all the 
mothers who had it before pregnancy had type 1 diabetes which 
means their bodies were not producing enough insulin to control 
blood sugar levels the women who developed diabetes during 
pregnancy generally had the type 2 variety in which the body fails 
to use insulin properly 
silverman spoke in a telephone interview before reporting 
results friday at a chicago meeting sponsored by the american 
diabetes association 
the study done with northwestern university in chicago focused 
on 124 children who were born of a diabetic pregnancy the racial 
mix was similar to the general population in chicago silverman 
said 
they were heavy at birth as previous studies would predict but 
normal size at age 1 the marked obesity appeared between ages 6 
and 8 
at age 8 54 percent of the boys and 44 percent of the girls 
weighed more than 90 percent of typical 8yearolds the 90percent 
mark for typical children is 689 pounds for boys and 697 pounds 
for girls 
another analysis focused on median weight the point where half 
the population weighs more and half weighs less the median for 
boys in the study was 713 pounds in comparison to 557 pounds for 
typical 8yearold boys half the girls in the study weighed more 
than 682 pounds while the typical mark is 546 pounds 
one clue to a possible explanation was that children who were 
heavier at ages 6 to 8 tended to have had more insulin in the 
amniotic fluid that surrounded them between the 32nd and 38th weeks 
of gestation 
silverman said the insulin was created by the fetus in response 
to blood sugar from the mother 
because of that process fetuses in diabetic mothers would pump 
out more insulin than those in nondiabetic mothers and longterm 
exposure to these higher levels might set them up for later 
obesity silverman suggested 
insulin may make fat cells larger or more numerous or affect 
areas of the developing brain that control appetite or have some 
longlasting affect on a childs metabolic rate he said 
the possible link to the mothers blood sugar suggests an 
additional reason for pregnant women with diabetes to control their 
blood sugar levels as tightly as possible silverman said 
no child in the study has yet developed diabetes nor do the 
children show unusual rates of medical problems he said 
dr david pettitt of the national institutes of health called 
the study important similar results had previously been found in 
the pima indians of arizona who are unusually susceptible to type 
2 diabetes but the new study shows this is not just a phenomenon 
of pima indians he said

evilseeming grayhaired man named bob whom viewers have seen 
only through the characters visions and dreams was placed at the 
scene of the crime 
bob was seen to strike vicious hammerlike blows on what 
presumably was laura palmer that prompted one tv writer to suggest 
that bobs bludgeoning was an attempt to administer cpr

gretchen was highborn beautiful and intelligent 
but the 7yearold german shepherd just couldnt stand noise any 
noise 
at night especially the slightest sound would send gretchen 
running barking growling it got so bad that gretchens owner 
started sleeping on an upstairs couch as far as possible from the 
skittish dog 
the dog always had a phobia of serious thunderstorms but 
somehow over the years it ballooned when she came to us she was a 
panting nervous wreck said dr nicholas dodman a tufts 
university veterinarian 
dodman an animal behaviorist and associate professor of 
surgery is among those who believe animals can be treated like 
humans for many of the same anxieties aggression compulsive 
behavior and depression 
gretchen for example was treated with mild tranquilizers a 
new diet and exercise her owner was counseled on a happy 
routine that would allay some of the dogs anxieties 
people ask are you a dog psychologist but really you cant 
be because you cant communicate with animals verbally you cant 
ask them about their problems and expect immediate feedback 
veterinarians have to be everything to animals doctors and 
psychologists dodman said 
pets most frequently suffer from types of aggression phobias 
and improper elimination due to stress dodman said the first step 
to treat those problems which also can be manifest in biting and 
barking is to look for medical disorders 
one of dodmans patients a cat named pepper overate but his 
binges werent limited to cat food pepper would eat anything 
parts of sofas blankets shoes he wasnt picky 
dodman ran tests on the cat and found that pepper suffered from 
pica an eating disorder that causes sufferers to crave roughage 
dodman prescribed a highfiber diet and pepper was cured 
dodman said treating emotional disorders in animals can save 
millions of pets that are put to sleep every year in the united 
states because owners and neighbors cannot tolerate their poor 
behavior about 10 million to 15 million dogs and cats are put to 
sleep in the united states each year 
penny cistaro the director of shelter operations at the 
massachusetts society for the prevention of cruelty to animals 
says many people are illprepared to handle their pets emotional 
problems her group offers training and counseling for pet owners 
and has a fulltime animal behaviorist on staff 
people dont bring their dog in and say i cant deal with 
him put him to sleep they say i cant deal with him find him 
a new home cistaro said 
euthanasia isnt a guaranteed ending for an animal brought 
into a shelter but it is something pet owners must be aware of 
sometimes it makes them realize that they really dont want to give 
their pet up she said 
dodman said he became interested in animal behavior when he 
studied horses and a habit called cribbing horses with this 
condition chew at their stalls and swallow air giving them a kind 
of high 
the high is caused by a chemical in the animals brain that is 
released when air is swallowed dodman discovered that drugs could 
block the release of the chemical essentially curing the horse 
since then dodman has become intrigued with the use of drug 
treatment for animals he said the pharmacological control of 
behavior is well developed in human research but for animals the 
idea is still in its infancy dodman is trying to change that by 
treating animals with traditionally forhumansonly drugs like 
valium and tranquilizers 
dr katherine a houpt professor of physiology at the new york 
state college of veterinary medicine at cornell university said 
its accepted practice for veterinarians to prescribe psychoactive 
drugs to animals its not usually for treatment of behavioral 
problems though 
after all you must remember that these drugs were tested on 
animals before we ever used them on humans 
dodman however said it was important to look for the cause of 
the problem first rather than the solution 
ive always believed that the root of the problem should be 
addressed first drugs should not necessarily be used to treat 
everything he said prevention is better than a cure thats 
step number one

saudi arabia expects to be producing 
85 million barrels of oil a day soon and is considering expanding 
its oil industry to put out 10 million barrels a day despite the 
threat of war with iraq 
saddam hussein has threatened to devastate the kingdoms main 
oilfields in the northeastern desert if the usdominated 
multinational force in saudi arabia launches an offensive to 
liberate occupied kuwait 
saudi officials speaking on condition of anonymity said it was 
only the fear of war not any actual shortage in the market that 
drove the price of a barrel of oil up from 16 before the crisis to 
its current 34 
but former saudi oil minister ahmed zaki yamani and other saudi 
sources said the fundamentals of the market do not justify an oil 
price much above 20 a barrel let alone the 40 a barrel touched 
recently 
yamani said that if iraq pulls out of kuwait peacefully and 
iraqi and kuwaiti production is rapidly restored the price is 
likely to drop even more steeply perhaps to well below 15 a 
barrel because of doubts about opecs ability to cut production 
promptly 
saudi officials are confident that if saddam attacked he would 
only be able to inflict minimal damage with his missiles and attack 
jets 
our defenses at the oilfields are good and the industry by its 
very structure is very widely dispersed said one saudi source 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
he noted that throughout the eightyear iraniraq war the 
iranians never stopped using their kharg island offshore oil 
terminal despite its proximity to iraq and almost daily air raids 
the saudis have already raised their oil output to 82 million 
barrels a day a 10year high and a 57 percent increase since iraq 
invaded kuwait aug 2 
this along with increases by other producers in the 13member 
organization of petroleum exporting countries has made up for the 
shortfall of 4 million barrels a day caused by the unimposed 
embargo on iraqi and kuwaiti oil 
the saudis are not even able to sell all of the oil they are 
producing now because customers are not buying up all of the 
inferior grades petroleum experts say 
but a new york analyst said friday it makes sense for them to 
have the capacity to pump 10 million barrels a day so they could 
try to control future price spikes or supply problems with quick 
jumps in production 
they dont want to see a situation where the supply would be 
disrupted said philip dodge of nomura securities international 
inc theyd like to be able to drive the price back to 20 today 
but they dont have the capacity to do it and they dont want to 
find themselves in that situation again 
the saudis who fear high oil prices will cut back demand are 
trying to calm world oil markets by telling reporters about the 
possibility that they could speed up the expansion another analyst 
said 
what they say and what they achieve could be two different 
things said annlouise hittle a senior oil analyst with 
shearson lehman brothers inc 
saudi arabia has about 255 billion barrels of proven reserves 
the largest in the world equal to the combined reserves of the 
united states soviet union china mexico and venezuela 
oil minister hisham nazer said last week that output could reach 
85 million barrels a day by the end of the year an expansion plan 
drawn up before the crisis aimed for 10 million barrels a day by 
1995 
although officials stress that no decision has been taken yet to 
implement the plan the saudis are considering accelerating it with 
1992 as a possible target date 
saudi authorities have announced at least six oil and gas 
discoveries over the past year in a previously unexploited desert 
region between 45 miles and 125 miles south of riyadh the capital 
the fields are wellplaced strategically with the nearest more 
than 310 miles from the kuwaiti border unlike the existing 
facilities in the eastern province 
nazer has refused to cite specific figures for the extent of the 
new reserves he says the area is still under exploration 
but a western oil analyst said informed speculation was that 
the area could contain up to 30 billion barrels of oil 
sydney bowers a geological consultant for saudi aramco said it 
was too early to provide figures and analysts stressed it would 
take years and major investments on infrastructure to bring the 
fields on stream 
saudi officials express confidence that any war in the region 
would lead to only a brief surge in oil prices followed by a sharp 
drop within a matter of days

when emperor hirohito ascended japans 
chrysanthemum throne 62 years ago the mystical coronation rite had 
the magnificence of a dream enveloped in eerie silence 
so wrote fanny davenport rogers macveagh wife of then us 
ambassador charles macveagh and one of the few foreigners invited 
to hirohitos enthronement 
hirohito died last year at age 87 his eldest son emperor 
akihito will be crowned monday 
in a 29page letter to her five sons written one month after the 
ceremony mrs macveagh gave a richly detailed account of the 1928 
enthronement that is the model for the rites planned for akihito 
count makino in the most archaic costume slowly mounted the 
steps on the side of the throne away from us and handed the emperor 
a tightly rolled scroll the emperor took it unrolled it and 
read it in a firm but rather low voice she wrote 
prime minister giichi tanaka then clambered down to a level 
below the octagonal purplecurtained throne to lead japanese 
guests and foreign dignitaries inside the ancient imperial palace 
of kyoto in three cheers of banzai a wish for long life 
then to my barbaric western mind then was the moment for the 
bells she continued but there were no bells if the slow 
mysterious sound of the temple gongs did float overfrom the city 
or from the monasteries on the surrounding mountains i at least 
never heard it the chief impression was that of the magnificence 
of a dream 
the enthronement monday will include representatives flown in 
from more than 150 countries a far cry from hirohitos coronation 
when 100 foreign guests from 28 countries took a 10hour ride by 
private train from tokyo to kyoto 
the foreigners all drawn from the diplomatic corps in tokyo 
arrived in marblewalled kyoto station nov 2 and were led to a 
procession of bright red limousines for mrs macveagh the arrival 
was marred only by photographers flash bulbs exploding 
continually about us 
the procession moved silently through crowdlined streets past 
gateways covered with green cypress twigs and torii the 
traditional gates to shinto shrines 
the few tramcars that were permitted to run were entirely 
covered with chrysanthemums and other flowers like floats in a 
flower festival she wrote lanterns lined the streets each 
topped with a parasol to keep out the rain 
the city was spotlessly clean and because the enthronement is 
even more a religious than a political festival and because the 
japanese are a distinctly silent people it was very quiet she 
wrote 
there was no one in kyoto during all that enthronement time 
who was not known to the police she wrote of the tight security 
which also will be in place for akihitos enthronement at least 
32000 police are to be deployed monday 
the night before hirohitos enthronement was spent resting and 
partying then on a sunny morning with a little wind of icy 
quality the foreign delegations rose early to attend the 
religious portion of the enthronement ceremony in which the emperor 
offers prayers to the sun goddess 
this year that segment will be strictly private to conform with 
the separation of religion and state mandated by japans postwar 
constitution the formal declaration of ascension to the throne 
however will be broadcast on national television the first time 
common japanese will be able to view the solemn rite 
ambassador macveagh a lawyer from new york and new hampshire 
was in the third of four years as head of the us mission to japan 
at the time of the coronation 
after the coronation the delegation returned to tokyo in a 
steady rain the emperor asked for protocol to be broken so people 
lining the streets could carry umbrellas 
the umbrellas said mrs macveagh added a note of comfort and 
wellbeing to what had otherwise been a most dreary spectacle 
while to these humble japanese people it was an unforgettable 
proof of the symapthy and love of their divine emperor

once excited by the prospect of huge 
investments in the soviet union the germans have grown 
increasingly cautious in the face of the growing unrest and 
economic woes plaguing the communist nation 
during a visit to germany on friday mikhail s gorbachev signed 
a historic nonaggression pact and made his nowfamiliar appeal for 
western cash to make his countrys reforms work 
chancellor helmut kohl promised to help the soviet union in 
word and deed and thanked the soviet president for clearing the 
way for german unification 
however no further financial aid is expected this year beyond 
the 195 billion already promised by the government and german 
banks financing german unification has strapped the national 
budget leaving little room for other major projects bankers also 
noted soviet political and economic strife 
before there was a lot of euphoria said peter pietsch 
spokesman for commerzbank one of germanys leading banks now 
the economic situation has worsened and german businessmen are 
much more wary 
on the economic side gorbachevs visit has so far produced only 
a german promise to look into increasing its imports of soviet oil 
and natural gas these already account for the largest chunk of 
germanys purchases from the soviets 
by contrast during a visit just 17 months ago gorbachev was 
wooed by enthusiastic german businessmen hungry for new markets 
since then german news reports have emphasized the ethnic and 
political strife and moribund economy that threaten the soviet 
union with collapse there have even been predictions that famine 
could strike parts of the country this winter 
as a result even the mighty deutsche bank which once took the 
lead in arranging credits for the soviet union has begun sounding 
the alarm 
the economic and financial situation especially the foreign 
economic situation is alarming and possibly even critical says 
hilmar kopper head of the bank germanys largest 
the soviet unions internal development is so unclear that it 
does not create a good climate for investments said karlhermann 
fink managing director of the german eastwest trade committee 
he said the soviets problems in developing an economic reform 
plan has even caused soviet officials to cancel appointments with 
willing german investors 
one stumbling block to greater investment has been soviet delays 
in ratifying a treaty that would protect german investments 
the treaty was signed by kohl and gorbachev during the kremlin 
chiefs visit to then west germany in june 1989 but has yet to be 
ratified 
they apparently havent been able to get it on their schedule 
because of uncertainty about the economic changes said economics 
ministry spokesman joachim romars 
german businessmen cite other difficulties in dealing with the 
soviet union including excessive bureaucracy and insufficient 
legal guidelines for doing business 
former west germany imported 39 billion worth of soviet goods 
in the first eight months of this year up only slightly from the 
same period last year 
by comparison west german exports to the soviets were 52 
billion in the first eight months of the year to put the figures 
in perspective exports to the soviets accounted for only 2 percent 
of former west germanys total trade for the period 
heavy machinery and equipment were the main import choices of 
the soviets eager to revamp their industry that was followed by 
hightech electronics products 
the 195 billion promised by the germans to the soviets this 
year comes in various forms of assistance it includes nearly 95 
billion in aid to help move 370000 soviet troops out of former 
east germany by 1994

relatives of americans trapped by saddam husseins desert stand 
have reluctantly come to consider the final and most frightening 
option war with iraq 
hes over there in the middle of it and im afraid said 
tamara rinehart of stover mo whose husband is holed up at the 
us embassy in kuwait still this seems to be what he wants 
jack rinehart is among a number of hostages who in letters 
smuggled out of iraq and kuwait in recent weeks have urged their 
families to make a case for quick decisive military action 
still it was with mixed emotions that the hostages relatives 
received word that 150000 more us troops were being sent to the 
persian gulf and that moscow had consented to the possible use of 
force there 
its terrifying but my father is already at risk and the 
longer he stays the more at risk he is said theresa murphy 
whose father is also among the holdouts at the us embassy in 
kuwait 
im relieved that it appears were finally going to do 
something instead of letting those people rot over there ms 
murphy of fremont calif said friday 
the prospect of war is horrifying to relatives of the estimated 
1000 americans who could be caught in the crossfire but 
increasingly they said military action seems the only way to free 
their loved ones and the tiny country of kuwait 
when you read his letters what becomes clear is that the 
hostages dont have a lot of time said attorney david mcdonald 
jr whose friend and client has been hiding in a safe house in 
kuwait 
i dont think military action would be anybodys first 
choice said mcdonald who asked that his friends identity be 
withheld but things are very tight food supplies are low 
the iraqis are everywhere the hostages dont have time to wait for 
protracted negotiations 
the situation is trickier still for those americans and other 
foreigners positioned by iraqi forces as socalled human 
shields hostages held at military installations and industrial 
plants could be closer to death 
if the shooting starts theyre in a very scary position 
said betty seago whose husband guy has been allowed to call home 
several times recently from unspecified strategic locations in 
iraq she has heard the quiet panic in his voice and felt utter 
frustration at her inability to help 
hes in a different position than those in hiding because 
the iraqis are right there with him said mrs seago of johnson 
city tenn the idea of war looks very different through his 
eyes 
but mrs seago and others said their hopes for a negotiated 
resolution have dwindled over the weeks as the political rhetoric 
and troop numbers have mounted the hostages families reluctantly 
have begun preparing for the worst 
when i first left kuwait i thought saddam might take his toys 
and go home but now i dont see him leaving kuwait 
peacefully said debbie willis who with her husband jerry was 
taken captive by iraqi troops during an escape attempt she was 
among the women and children saddam later agreed to release 
i think we have to be prepared for war for something long 
bloody and ugly said mrs willis who served four years in the 
army before becoming an attorney and moving to kuwait with her 
husband a native of johnson city tenn 
i think an allout military exercise is whats going to 
happen she said but my god i hope not

officials in the danish capital 
believe theyve found a way to stop bicycle thefts let people use 
them for free 
starting in may 5000 bicycles carrying advertising from 
sponsors will be placed in 900 bike racks throughout copenhagen 
theyll be available for use by anyone who needs them tourists 
shoppers businessmen late for an appointment or commuters who have 
missed the bus 
you take a bike drive around as long as you want it and put 
it back in a specialbuilt rack no charge explained ole 
wessung a 30yearold chiropractor and an originator of the 
bycykel city bike project 
i had enough of getting my bicycles stolen five of them have 
disappeared within three months he said 
according to police 101288 bicycles were reported stolen in 
1989 in denmark a loss of 174 million 
wessung and publisher morten sadolin 30 spent two years 
developing the project and hope to make money by selling the 
advertising space on the bicycles 
the copenhagen city council interested in reducing air 
pollution traffic congestion and bike thefts has given 
permission for placement of the bicycle racks on almost every other 
street corner 
a similar plan was proposed for amsterdam in the 1970s but never 
caught on the dutch city however a similar freebike plan is 
operating successfully at the hoge veluwe national park in the 
netherlands in the closedoff area visitors can pick up a bike 
for free and drop it off anywhere else on the grounds 
eight companies have put up the first 17 million to get the 
copenhagen project going 
they sign a threeyear contract and during that period 
bicycles with their brands and colors will be seen in the 
streets said wessung 
the clumsylooking bicycles have big flat central tubes where 
sponsors advertisements will be placed but the ungraceful 
appearance also has another purpose 
they are easily recognizable and were designed so no one would 
steal them says wessung everyone can see its a bycycle if 
you are spotted 200 kilometers 125 miles away from copenhagen 
youre either a good rider or a thief 
wouldbe thieves are discouraged from stealing the bike for 
refitting because standard saddles wheels and other parts do not 
fit the bycycle which means city bike in danish 
wessung says the bikes are easily maneuverable but have no 
speeds 
they can be obtained in the way travelers get luggage carts at 
international airports 
users insert a coin worth 350 in a slot on the bike and are 
then able tounlock it from the stand a coin of the same value is 
returned when the bike is relocked into another rack 
wessung and sadolin plan to test their bycycle next year in 
paris and rome where authorities are trying to discourage use of 
cars in the city centers 
we hope businessmen tourists and everyone will borrow our 
bicycles to get around in copenhagen people are screaming about 
pollution and the copenhagen municipality wants a carfree city 
wessung said 
so heres the alternative

the masthead on a newsletter that follows 
economic indicators is red for the first time in eight years 
flashing a warning that the nations economy may be headed for a 
recession 
eighty percent of the 55 prominent economists the blue chip 
economic indicators newsletter surveys each month now say a 
recession will begin before yers end another five percent say 
the contraction will begin in 1991 
but a big majority say that the downturn wont last long and 
that it will be mild 
it now seems very likely that americas longest peacetime 
expansion is about to come to an end editor robert j eggert of 
eggert economic enterprises inc in sedona ariz wrote in 
fridays edition 
a recession generally is defined as two consecutive quarterly 
declines in the gross national product the nations total output 
of goods and services and its broadest measure of economic 
activity 
throughout the eightyear expansion the newsletter masthead has 
been printed in either green or yellow green meant the economy was 
expanding above its longrange growth potential of 3 percent while 
yellow warned that growth was lagging between zero and 29 percent 
the survey found that threefourths of the respondents expect 
any downturn to last no more than two or three quarters 
an even larger majority 82 percent anticipate that the 
recession will be relatively mild the newsletter said 
the surveys consensus forecast anticipated a 08 percent annual 
rate of decline during the current quarter followed by a 06 
percent drop from january through march 1991 it projected growth 
picking up 08 percent 21 percent and 25 percent in the 
following quarters 
the outlook for inflation also continued on the gloomy side 
with the consensus estimate for the annualized rate of increase in 
the consumer price index for the current quarter jumping to 71 
percent the newsletter reported 
this would push the inflation rate for the year to 55 percent 
however the inflation rate would slow to a 52 percent increase 
during 1991 
the blue chip consensus projects overall gnp growth of 10 
percent this year the economy grew 17 percent at an annual rate 
in the first quarter followed by 04 percent and 18 percent rates 
in the next two 
but expectations for growth in 1991 continued to slide 
dropping threetenths of a percentage point to a paltry 05 
percent 
since the last recession the economy is believed to have grown 
for 95 months through september surpassing the previous peacetime 
growth record of 58 months between 1975 and 1980 the current 
overall record was 106 months from 1961 to 1969 which included the 
vietnam war 
the survey participants represent many of the nations top 
banks brokerage firms corporations economic forecasting 
organizations and universities 
other economists however still believe the economy can skirt a 
recession 
for instance economist stephen s roach of morgan stanley amp co 
told a reporter that while the economy could fall during the 
current quarter we are not projecting two consecutive quarters 
of declining gnp 
lawrence kudlow a top reagan administration economist now with 
bear stearns amp co told the us chamber of commerce on thursday 
he foresees no offthecliff recession although he would not 
be surprised to see a negative fourth quarter 
even president bush acknowledged at his thursday news conference 
that were in for some tough times right now but avoided using 
the word recession 
and michael boskin bushs chief economic adviser said thursday 
the economy could slip into negative territory this year 
the economy at best is in a lull but we do expect that lull to 
be relatively brief and relatively minor boskin told the 
american council for capital formation here

a veterans panel says it is hoping for a 
november 1991 ground breaking for a korean war veterans memorial 
whose design has raised objections from its original architects 
but first an additional 6 million must be raised through the 
sale of commemorative silver dollars said the korean war veterans 
memorial advisory board created by congress to oversee the 
project the final memorial cost is estimated at 149 million 
board spokesman bill russell said friday that organizers hoped 
construction could begin in a year despite complaints by the 
original architects that their design has been altered 
the national capital memorial commission approved the design 
including the revisions during a hearing thursday russell said 
the commission is part of the interior department 
four pennsylvania state university architects beat out 1018 
competitors last year in a 20000 contest to design the memorial 
across the reflecting pool from the vietnam veterans memorial the 
entry was declared the winner by a jury of korean war veterans 
the design called for a dreamlike collection of 38 soldiers 
moving some unevenly across a remote landscape toward an american 
flag the architects said the soldiers were to show the 
experience of moving into and through war 
but last month they went public with complaints that the design 
had been turned into a gi joe battle scene by placing soldiers 
in battleready positions 
the design in its current status is not the design that won 
the national competition said a statement the architects 
delivered to the white house on sept 25 
the changes were executed by cooperlecky architects of 
washington based on suggestions from the national capital planning 
commission and the us fine arts commission the advisory board 
said those two commissions must still approve the final design 
the advisory board says the original architects relinquished 
all rights to their submission in consideration of substantial 
prize money the board chairman retired army gen richard 
stilwell said in a recent statement 
stilwell said the architects were retained as consultants to the 
final design he denied that the new design called for a battle 
scene but said the statutes would indeed appear combatready 
historically memorial design development is an evolutionary 
process the direction of which the pennsylvania consultants have 
been opposing said a statement released by the board after 
thursdays hearing 
but robert sokolove the architects attorney said his clients 
were shut out of the process after they won the money you cant 
change the rules in the middle he said

parliament has approved a new law that 
seeks to end inconclusive elections and makes it harder for very 
small parties and independents to win 
the conservative new democracy party which holds 151 seats in 
the 300member parliament proposed the law after winning elections 
in april 
inconclusive polls in june and november led to shortlived 
coalition governments 
the new system adopted friday allows a single party to win a 
majority in parliament with about 43 percent of the vote down from 
47 percent while making it harder for a coalition of parties to 
win elections 
the new law also stipulates that small parties secure at least 3 
percent of the vote to be represented in parliament this change 
will effectively bar several small parties and independents who 
were elected in the past 
the socialist and communist opposition voted against the new 
law

arizona republican john mccain will be the 
first of the keating five senators to state his case when the 
senate ethics committee begins public hearings next week according 
to the committee staff 
until now the panel has heard testimony and deliberated in 
secret but beginning thursday it will publicly listen to facts 
and explanations from the five senators who went to bat for charles 
keating jrs savings and loan 
on friday the committee held a private drawing to determine the 
order in which the five senators would appear said staff director 
wilson abney 
mccain drew the leadoff spot he said 
he will be followed by four democrats sens john glenn of ohio 
donald riegle of michigan dennis deconcini of arizona and alan 
cranston of california 
abney said the committee abandoned its earlier plan to consider 
the cases in alphabetical order because there was some concern 
that doing it alphabetically was too arbitrary 
he wouldnt describe the drawing and said only that the order of 
appearance was determined by lot drawn by counsel to the 
senators 
mccains office said he was in arizona and not immediately 
available for comment 
the factfinding hearings were ordered after the panel met 
privately with each senator and then considered a report in which 
its special counsel robert s bennett outlined the evidence and 
recommended that the committee drop its investigation of mccain and 
glenn 
the committee is considering whether the five senators violated 
the senate ethics code by taking large contributions from keating 
and later assisting his collapsing thrift 
keatings thrift the californiabased lincoln savings and loan 
was seized by the government last year at a potential cost to 
taxpayers of more than 2 billion 
before the government acted the five senators met with federal 
regulators who were examining lincoln all five have said there was 
no connection between the meetings with regulators and the 
donations from keating and his associates 
keating has been charged in california with criminal fraud 
the charges relate to the sale of 250 million in highrisk 
bonds to lincoln depositors the bonds became worthless when

president bush is under intense pressure to 
reduce the 32 billion polish debt to the united states as a 
result of a bill he signed into law this week 
the law tells him to delay making the us contribution to the 
european bank for reconstruction and development until polands 
debt and the payments the financially strapped country is expected 
to make are cut 
the united states and 41 other members will own the bank which 
is being organized in london to help the soviet union and eastern 
european countries move to a market economy 
the us share of the banks 12 billion capital will be 12 
billion the largest investment of any single country it will 
require five annual payments into the bank of 70 million with an 
additional 850 million available to the bank if needed 
congress insists in the new law on foreign aid that bush must 
first make an arrangement with poland and its other debtors to 
reduce the countrys debt to something that reflects its actual 
value 
polands debt to commercial banks was selling on the market nov 
1 at about 13 cents on the dollar at that rate the 32 billion 
debt to the united states would be worth only 415 million 
poland owes its biggest creditor germany 48 billion germany 
has already cancelled 513 million of the money poland owes and has 
said poland can pay another 370 million in its own currency 
we didnt want this country paying into the bank so that the 
poles could borrow money to pay germany said rep david r obey 
who has major responsibility in congress for international finance 
everybody knows the poles are bankrupt and cant pay if you 
look at the administrations budget documents youll see they 
arent expecting anything from poland for five years the question 
is whether theyll admit that or keep on playing this phony game 
of rescheduling delaying payments 
obey dwis chairs the foreign operations subcommittee of the 
house appropriations committee 
polands debt to western countries was 408 billion at the end 
of last year 28 billion of it to individual governments 
according to krzysztof krowacki financial counselor of the polish 
embassy 
poland owes france 39 billion and brazil 32 billion 
krowacki said 
most of polands debt to the united states came from loans to 
help the country buy surplus us farm products a smaller part was 
lent by the us governments exportimport bank so that poland 
could buy industrial products 
debts owed by governments to other governments are regularly 
considered at closeddoor meetings of creditors known as the paris 
club a polish newspaper report on a meeting last month said that 
us representatives let it be known that they would favor debt 
reductions for poland and that british and italian representatives 
had responded favorably 
richard boucher state department spokesman told a news 
briefing earlier this week that the united states is not standing 
in the way of an agreement on polish debt 
we have long supported and do still support multilateral 
efforts such as those in the paris club to deal with the problems 
that poland faces as a result of its debt he said

a minister pushing for a state holiday honoring 
the rev martin luther king jr isnt bothered by the episcopalian 
churchs decision to hold a convention in arizona despite voters 
rejection of a king day 
with the seriousness of our efforts to still obtain the 
holiday im sure the group will address the issue and encourage 
the principles that martin luther king stood for henry barnwell 
said friday 
we know we have their support we had it prior to the 
election there will probably be enough conventions canceling as 
it is barnwell said adding that his group has put on hold its 
boycott strategy until they have exhausted all other means of 
getting the holiday adopted 
barnwell pastor of the first new life missionary baptist 
church is chairman of a group called arizonans for a martin luther 
king holiday that he said led the movement for the holiday in 1987 
when impeached gov evan mecham rescinded former gov bruce 
babbitts executive order creating a holiday 
the episcopal church announced this week that it would go ahead 
with its plans to hold its triennial general convention in phoenix 
even though arizona voters on tuesday rejected two ballot measures 
that would have established a king holiday 
also after the election national football league commissioner 
paul tagliabue said he will recommend that the 1993 super bowl be 
moved in protest from phoenix but episcopal presiding bishop 
edmond browning said more good can be done by staying 
the episcopal church will go to phoenix while we cannot 
ignore or condone the results of the referendum i believe that by 
working with people of good faith who are in arizona we can come 
and together make a vigorous witness for the dignity of all gods 
people and against the evils of racism browning said 
in his statement browning said he was terribly disappointed 
by the decision to reject the king holiday 
browning spiritual leader of the nearly 25 millionmember 
denomination noted that he had lobbied the arizona legislature for 
a king holiday but had said at the time i was not issuing 
threats about not coming to arizona 
i came to say that i believed that they were confronting a 
moral issue of deep significance and that is racism browning 
said dr king brought to us a message of what this country could 
be if we were able to find racial equality observing a holiday in 
his name goes deeper than honoring him it reminds us of who we 
must be as a nonracist society 
arizona episcopal bishop joseph t heistand said he will 
continue to struggle for the passage of a martin luther king civil 
rights day 
i dont believe the majority of citizens of arizona are 
racist i believe they stand for justice and civil rights for all 
people he said 
the head of a lobbying group for south african sanctions that 
received its start with a grant from a black episcopal church 
leader said the churchs decision was unfortunate 
the episcopal church should be in the front lines here and it 
is terribly regrettable to find the church lagging behind the 
nfl said randall robinson head of transafrica in washington 
dc 
his organization received its first grant in 1977 from the rev 
canon robert cs powell a black episcopalian who directed the 
national mission in church and society 
norman braman owner of the philadelphia eagles and chairman of 
the super bowl site selection committee said he expected that the 
nfl commissioners recommendation to move the game would be 
approved 
i think it would be an affront to our public and our players 
if the game is played in phoenix braman said 
up to 9000 people are expected to attend the episcopalian 
convention july 1120 in phoenix church news director james 
solheim said 
earlier this week david radcliffe president of phoenix amp 
valley of the sun convention and visitors bureau said he knew of 
at least four groups that have canceled reservations for 
conventions or stays at hotels since the propositions failed

a congressman who sponsored a bill aimed at 
lowering the cost of some drugs says he was shocked at president 
bushs pocket veto of the measure without any previous warnings 
that he opposed it 
the bill supported by aids activists and other advocacy groups 
was aimed at lowering prices of orphan drugs that have limited 
sales potential when they are first developed 
some drug companies have gotten to the ear of the white 
house said rep henry waxman dcalif 
waxman said companies dont want to lose the millions of dollars 
they earn by being the monopoly supplier of drugs used to treat 
diseases that once were limited to a small population but have 
spread to thousands of people 
he said drugs to treat aids for example should no longer be 
considered orphan drugs 
waxman said he was really shocked that bush did not sign the 
bill because the white house had never made a fuss previously 
about the legislation 
the pharmaceutical manufacturing association opposed the 
legislation but said it was not recommending that bush veto it 
the bill applies to drugs used against diseases that affect 
fewer than 200000 people it was designed to foster more 
competition by eliminating the sevenyear exclusive marketing 
rights granted under current law to companies that develop such 
drugs 
bush withheld his signature from the bill killing it through 
what is known as a pocket veto 
i have serious concerns about the effect that the bill would 
have upon the incentive of drug companies to develop orphan 
drugs bush said in a statement 
the white house contends that taking away the exclusivity 
benefit actually would decrease the willingness of firms to come up 
with orphan drugs because of the expense involved in the research 
and development 
the new legislation would have cut off a drugs orphan drug 
status as soon as the number of people who need the drug exceeded 
200000 
the food and drug administration has granted socalled orphan 
status to more than 375 drugs more than 40 of which have reached 
the market 
some of the diseases that orphan drugs have been developed to 
treat include huntingtons disease tourettes syndrome narcolepsy 
and muscular dystrophy 
on a separate matter bush on friday signed a bill requiring 
food manufacturers to put more nutrition information on the labels 
of food packaging 
the legislation mandates that most bulk food in bins raw fish 
and fruits and vegetables be displayed with a sign or brochure 
providing nutritional information

czechoslovakia may soon overtake hungary as 
the country of choice for us investments in the former 
communist bloc says a us trade official 
the pace of czechoslovakias transition from government to 
market control of the economy is now quickening said franklin j 
vargo deputy assistant commerce secretary for europe 
the central european country provides a 4 billion annual market 
for western goods and this should double triple or quadruple in 
the next 1015 years vargo said friday for investment 
czechoslovakia in the near future could become the country of 
choice he said 
vargo was the main speaker at the 10th session of the 
czechoslovakus economic council attended by more than 200 
business people and government officials from the two countries 
the meeting at us chamber of commerce headquarters was the 
councils first since the collapse of communist rule in last years 
peaceful revolution 
it followed by one day an announcement by general motors corp 
of an agreement for the bratislava automobile works in slovakia to 
build 250000 automobile transmissions and to assemble gms opel 
cars for local distribution 
czechoslovakia took only 70 million or less than 2 percent of 
its western imports from the united states last year compared to 40 
percent from germany vargo said 
but he urged us businessmen to regard the country not as a 
70 million market but as a future billiondollar market 
us businesses tend to pass up all but the biggest markets 
vargo said in contrast to the germans british and japanese 
vargo said he hopes final approval of longawaited most favored 
nation treatment between the united states and czechoslovakia 
providing reciprocal tariff concessions comes during president 
bushs planned nov 17 visit to prague the concessions are in the 
new usczechoslovak trade treaty whose ratification was delayed 
in congress until last month and still awaits czechoslovak 
ratification 
czechoslovak economic reform has lagged in such matters as 
lifting price control he said with 90 percent of prices still 
fixed by government compared to 30 percent in hungary and 10 
percent in poland 
czechoslovakia has set jan 1 for launching major economic 
reforms including internal convertibility of its currency and 
steppedup privatization of industry

the new troop buildup ordered by president 
bush will push americas fighting force in the persian gulf to 
430000 and stop planned troop rotations that could have brought 
some soldiers home officials say 
pentagon officials speaking privately said the troop buildup 
would likely not be completed until early next year 
the additional 200000 men and women that bush ordered to the 
gulf thursday will give the united states a clear offensive 
potential against iraq which now holds an advantage in numbers of 
troops in the gulf area 
the move also will mean a huge drain on us military manpower 
elsewhere and thus will kill plans for relieving some weary 
soldiers in the gulf with fresh troops 
asked by a reporter whether the us forces now in the gulf and 
those soon to be en route will be there for the duration of the 
crisis defense secretary dick cheney said thats correct 
pentagon officials had been preparing a rotation plan that they 
said would improve troop morale which has suffered in some cases 
from troops uncertainty about how long they will be required to 
endure the gulfs harsh living conditions 
by adding about 200000 forces to the 230000 already in and 
around saudi arabia bush is roughly matching the size of the iraqi 
force in kuwait and southern iraq 
the united states will have fewer tanks in the area than iraq 
but more of the most modern models 
bush was out of the public eye friday at camp david md but 
his defense secretary underscored the presidents comments of a day 
earlier by emphasizing the us forces ability to attack and by 
making clear their deployment could be long term 
like bush cheney stressed that the new buildup was meant as a 
signal to saddam hussein that the united states was preparing the 
forces necessary to undertake offensive operations should that 
become necessary to get iraq out of kuwait 
cheneys remarks highlighted a fundamental shift in stated us 
military goals in the gulf from defending saudi oil fields to in 
effect giving saddam an ultimatum either withdraw from kuwait 
within weeks or face a massive us attack 
also friday the navy said it was sending the aircraft carriers 
uss theodore roosevelt uss america and uss ranger plus their 
battle group components to the gulf area that would increase to 
six the number of us carriers there the united states has 14 
carriers of which 12 are capable of deploying 
naval authorities in san diego announced that a southern 
california amphibious group would join the extended deployment to 
operation desert shield 
the 13ship amphibious group three based in san diego and long 
beach consists of the uss tarawa uss tripoli uss new orleans 
uss mobile uss vancouver uss denver uss juneau uss anchorage 
uss mt vernon uss germantown uss barbour county uss peoria and 
uss frederick 
the 5th marine expeditionary brigade from camp pendleton will 
leave along with the navy task force officials said without 
disclosing when the task force would depart

david paul the former centrust bank chairman 
accused of using thrift money to bankroll an extravagant lifestyle 
is one of 16 former sampl officials facing a federal complaint that 
seeks 250 million 
the complaint filed friday by attorneys for the resolution trust 
corp stems from the 18 billion collapse of centrust once the 
largest thrift in the southeast the rtc is a government agency 
that oversees failed thrifts 
paul who has not been criminally charged also faces an 
administrative order by the federal office of thrift supervision 
seeking 308 million for what they say was his insatiable greed 
and vanity 
fridays complaint charges the defendants with breaches of 
fiduciary duty waste and mismanagement 
if we were to recover 250 million that is a small portion of 
what the taxpayers are due steve katsanos an rtc spokesman 
said late friday 
paul has been held up as a symbol of the excesses in the 
nations savings amp loan crisis he ranks second only to former 
lincoln savings and loan owner charles h keating jr in terms of 
the money sought by the ots for lavish expenditures made by sampl 
executives at the expense of customers 
in fridays court action katsanos cited such centrust expenses 
as the acquisition of a corporate jet and sailboat 30 million in 
artwork and opulent headquarters outfitted with goldplated 
bathroom plumbing and a marble staircase 
the centrust tower a familiar part of the miami skyline is now 
on the auction block federal regulators seized control of

john sununu president bushs top adviser 
is gone but not forgotten in his home state where bitterness over 
his lingering political influence is building after this weeks 
election 
gov judd gregg blamed sununu this week for the stunning upset 
of a fellow republican seeking reelection to congress while other 
gop leaders said it is time for the former governor to butt out of 
new hampshire politics 
the white house said sununu bushs chief of staff would have 
no comment on the controversy 
the feud went public when gregg said sununu and his wife nancy 
were at least partly to blame for democrat dick swetts 
congressional victory over freshman rep chuck douglas in tuesdays 
election 
earlier this year mrs sununu criticized douglas lifestyle 
including three divorces and threatened to run against him in the 
republican primary 
swett quoted her in campaign literature and the sununus said 
nothing to counter the remarks douglas defeat cost the republican 
party a seat it had held in congress for 75 years 
greggs spokesman brian grip said the governors criticism of 
his predecessor only was related to the douglasswett election but 
other republicans said it was symptom of a larger rift between the 
two 
for a long time everybody kept looking to sununu said 
former state republican chairman john stabile but greggs 
overwhelming reelection shows he is a formidable force and i 
think he wants people to fully recognize that now stabile said 
state sen charles bass also said a potential showdown is 
brewing between gregg and sununu over who the next chairman of the 
new hampshire republican party will be he said gregg is backing 
state sen rhona charbonneau while sununus choice is gop activist 
max hugel 
im fighting the white house for this position charbonneau 
said friday 
she added she has been at odds with sununu since she told him 
earlier this year that it was time he quit meddling in new 
hampshire politics 
when i told them to stay out of our politics i dont think 
they liked it charbonneau said i think that gov sununu has 
got to let go of the state 
she said she was punished by being kept off the stage during a 
campaign visit by bush last month 
hugel who led a national republican voter drive in 1980 and was 
a reagan administration cia official said he is surprised at being 
linked to sununu 
i am an ally and friend and backer of judd gregg too and 
judd gregg knows that he said i have supported republicans up 
and down the line 
greggs father hugh a former governor played down the idea of 
a turf battle between his son and sununu but acknowledged that 
there is a history of political bad blood 
the elder gregg said sununu wrongly claimed credit for bushs 
key victory in the 1988 new hampshire primary 
for 10 years we the greggs had been working for george bush 
and set up an organization and campaign and everything else he 
said sununu never gave any credit to anyone but himself but it 
wasnt a singlehanded effort by any means

the countrys new prime minister facing what he called a grim 
and challenging task to quell widespread unrest that helped 
topple his predecessor 
the 63yearold socialist leader took the oath from president 
ramaswamy venkataraman outside the presidential palace 
chandra shekhar who led efforts to unseat vp singh as prime 
minister pledged friday that his government will seek to create 
a society of equals in a nation where thousands have died this 
year in battles over religious ethnic and class differences 
the clashes were used to rally opposition against singh the 
first indian prime minister to be ousted by parliament he lost a 
confidence vote wednesday in all humility i would like to say 
that the task before us is arduous chandra shekhar said friday 
it is so grim and challenging but one has to make every endeavor 
to retrieve the situation 
at least 370 people have died in the last three weeks in 
hindumoslem riots over a 460yearold mosque that some hindus 
claim was build on the site of the warrior god rama hindus seeks 
to raze the mosque in ayodhya in northeast india and build a 
temple 
meanwhile at least 150 uppercaste students have committed 
suicide or died in clashes with police to protest singhs attempt 
to reserve more government jobs for lowcaste hindus 
violent separatist campaigns in kashmir and punjab in the north 
and assam in the east have cost thousands of lives with 1990 
emerging as the bloodiest year 
chandra shekhar said he will seek parliaments endorsement of 
his government by nov 20 so far he has not disclosed his cabinet 
plans 
devi lal a bitter rival of singh was sworn in saturday as 
deputy prime minister a post he held until singh fired him over 
the summer 
chandra shekhar walked away with 56 dissident members from 
singhs janata dal party and voted against him devi lal sided with 
chandra shekhar and his breakaway janata dal socialist party 
chandra shekhar has never held a cabinet job in his more than 
three decades in politics he has served in senior posts in a 
series of parties and was elected to parliament four times

parties on thursday declined venkataramans invitation to form a 
government

decisionmaking lower house of parliament 
chandra shekhar claims the support of 280 members including 195 
votes from former prime minister rajiv gandhis congress party 
gandhi has said his party the largest in parliament will not 
participate in chandra shekhars government but will back it in 
parliamentary procedures about 15 other smallparty allies of the 
congress party also have pledged to back chandra shekhar who does 
not use a surname 
singhs 11monthold coalition government lost its majority in 
parliament last month after the withdrawal of the hindu 
fundamentalist bharatiya janata party over the mosque dispute 
the party was angered by singhs opposition to plans to build 
the temple on the mosque site 
chandra shekhar said his first step would be to apply the 
healing touch and cool down tempers 
we have to eliminate mutual discord and hatred with the firm 
faith that problems can be solved by cooperation he said 
he declined to spell out details of his economic policy saying 
our priority would be to meet the basic needs of our people 
on foreign policy he said india will not create a sense of 
doubt among smaller nations and will not bow to bigger powers

threatening to jail parents of chronic truants is 
one way to ensure students get a better education some officials 
say 
but anetha and willie dorsey the first parents convicted under 
a city pilot program insist theyre being punished for a 
situation beyond their control 
i dont think its fair said mrs dorsey 44 a homemaker 
and mother of 12 were doing the best we can we buy him 
clothes give him lunch money and we get him up he just didnt 
go 
on wednesday the dorseys parents of a 15yearold amundsen 
high school student were hauled into court and charged with 
letting the boy miss too much school a misdemeanor 
cook county circuit judge thaddeus kowalski scolded the boy and 
sentenced the couple to a year of court supervision 
the judge also ordered the couple to go to school to pick up 
their sons report cards and to attend three meetings of the local 
school council that panel was instrumental in forming the schools 
new truancy program 
if the boy who missed 80 days last year and has already missed 
17 days this year is absent again without an excuse state law 
would allow for his parents to be jailed for up to 30 days and 
fined up to 500 
theres a direct correlation between how well students do 
and attendance said pauline tarvardian who oversees attendance 
matters at amundsen 
if they are doing well and we expect our students to do well 
we expect them to be here every day she said friday 
the couples conviction followed repeated warnings it was the 
first since a joint program between the school and the cook county 
states attorneys office to end truancy was announced in may 
truancy was becoming a growing problem in cook county said 
dan mccullough a state attorneys spokesman 
educators and prosecutors first try numerous ways to persuade 
parents to get their children to school he said court action 
against the parents is a last resort 
our intent was never to put parents in jail said harriet 
odonnell a school council member at amundsen who was instrumental 
in developing the program our intent was to get kids back in 
school where they belong 
in illinois 180 days of school are required and under the pilot 
program a student must miss 18 days to be declared a chronic 
truant the action was taken as a result of last years attendance 
records odonnell said 
absentees at amundsen are down significantly from a year ago 
when an average of 76 percent of students attended school on any 
given day tarvardian said yesterday we had 90 percent 
attendance she said 
amundsens program is one of a series of moves taken by 
authorities nationwide to cut absenteeism 
in milwaukee this week a judge reinstated an experimental 
program docking the welfare benefits of families whose teenagers 
skip school last year a baltimore woman was sentenced to 10 days 
in jail for letting her daughter miss 101 days of school

the justice department is abandoning a plan to 
stop homeless people from sleeping on a steam grate just yards from 
the street entrance to attorney general dick thornburghs office 
workers recently dismantled a partially constructed fence around 
the steam grate the fence drew protests in september from homeless 
people and their advocates the day of the protest someone drove 
off with the iron gate which had not been installed by workmen 
until this week the fence had stood without the gate allowing 
homeless people to continue to sleep atop the grate which covers a 
vent to a steam tunnel that runs between the justice department and 
several adjacent government buildings 
workmen planted holly bushes around the grate before removing 
the uncompleted fence 
justice department spokesman dan eramian said the fence was to 
be installed as a security measure 
the attorney general never thought it was a good idea 
eramian said adding that thornburgh didnt know about plans to 
build it until the day of the protest 
a department source speaking on condition of anonymity said an 
alternative measure had been taken to prevent anyone from entering 
the steam tunnel

two women say they were cured of lyme 
disease by deliberately contracting malaria 
cyndi monahan 29 and sallie timpone 30 both of new jersey 
said they were infected with blood tainted by a nonrecurring 
strain of malaria at a mexican medical college in late september 
in interviews friday from the midwest lyme disease symposium in 
lincoln neb the two women said they were weak but free of pain 
for the first time in years just weeks after malarial fevers 
wracked their bodies 
proponents of the treatment believe the malaria triggers an 
immune reaction that kills the bacteria causing lyme disease 
monahan a former body builder and aerobics instructor had 
spent 2 years curled up in a fetal position because the lyme 
disease had damaged her joints she said she developed three 
cancerous lesions as a result of the illness and that her 
oncologist has declared her free of all signs of malignancy since 
her trip to mexico 
i was scared out of my pants she said im going to some 
third world country getting injected with malaria but i just knew 
this was going to work i feel like the poltergeist shes back 
 
timpone said her nineyear battle with the disease transmitted 
by ticks left her with symptoms of meningitis encephalitis and 
other neurological disorders 
though she is confident the disease will not recur she warns 
other sufferers not to rush to mexico in a panic without 24hour 
treatment at home for the month while the fevers rage the therapy 
should not be risked she said 
both women two of 13 people who have tried the therapy said 
they risked the treatment out of desperation years of antibiotic 
treatments did not clear up the symptoms and both were nearly 
incapacitated while a stream of doctors pronounced them cured 
malaria therapy which has not been approved for practice in the 
united states was proposed as treatment for lyme disease by dr 
henry heimlich best known for the maneuver named for him used to 
save choking victims 
in a telephone interview from nebraska he said he borrowed the 
idea from an old treatment for syphilis malaria therapy had been 
used for nearly 60 years until 1975 to treat syphilis by setting 
off an immune reaction and high fevers he said 
heimlich said he thought the therapy would be effective with 
lyme disease because the two illnesses are similar both are caused 
by corkscrewshaped bacteria called spirochetes he said 
from all appearances from these patients we can say that 
people who were severely crippled and bound to their home and could 
barely walk are well at this moment and are not in pain he said 
we cannot answer what percentage will have these results i cant 
answer if they can be reinfected again or what will happen the rest 
of their lives 
willy burdorfer the research scientist credited with 
discovering the bacteria that causes lyme disease described 
himself as cautiously excited about the treatment 
dr david dennis the physician in charge of the lyme disease 
program at the federal centers for disease control said the 
treatment is too preliminary for him to comment on its merit

the new troop buildup ordered by president 
bush will push americas fighting force in the persian gulf to 
430000 and stop planned troop rotations that could have brought 
some soldiers home officials say 
pentagon officials speaking privately said the troop buildup 
would likely not be completed until early next year 
the additional 200000 men and women that bush ordered to the 
gulf thursday will give the united states a clear offensive 
potential against iraq which now holds an advantage in numbers of 
troops in the gulf area 
the move also will mean a huge drain on us military manpower 
elsewhere and thus will kill plans for relieving some weary 
soldiers in the gulf with fresh troops
