sen claiborne pell chairman of the 
senate foreign relations committee returned monday from a fiveday 
visit to cuba that he said may have provided a tiny nudge toward 
improved relations 
pells trip included a threehour meeting with cuban president 
fidel castro who he said is eager to resume normal diplomatic 
relations with the united states 
pell a democrat said he probably would report on the trip to 
secretary of statedesignate james baker when the two meet wednesday 
i think we may have given it a tiny nudge pell said in a 
telephone interview after his arrival at andrews air force base 
outside washington i think some little improvements could be 
made and out of those little improvements big improvements could 
follow 
he refused to cite specifics but when pressed said the united 
states and cuba both need to pull in our horns a little bit and 
the united states should tone down radio marti and not start tv 
marti 
radio marti aims american governmentgenerated programming into 
cuba a pell aide said that during the senators discussion with 
castro the cuban leader was very angry about plans to expand radio 
marti to a television service and claimed that was one of the major 
stumbling blocks to diplomatic relations 
pell said he doubted much could be done to stop the reagan 
administrations plans to launch the tv service 
the senator said he suggested to castro that releasing four 
political prisoners remaining from the revolution in which castro 
came to power would be a good first step to improve relations with 
the united states 
i dont want to be too optimistic about that i certainly didnt 
come back with any firm agreements pell said 
it was pells third trip to the island and his first since 1974 
he said the change in presidents in this country and cubas recent 
agreement to pull its troops out of the african nation of angola 
provide a window to improve relations 
peace seems to be breaking out in all parts of the world there 
is no reason it cannot break out in that little corner of the 
caribbean he said

an ancient bronze vessel that was to be auctioned 
in new york had been stolen in june from a chinese museum an 
official report said monday 
chinas interpol office notified its us counterpart saturday of 
the theft and chinese police met monday with a us embassy 
official to ask the us governments help in recovering it 
the ritual vessel called a dui was to be auctioned at sothebys 
in new york on tuesday the xinhua news agency said 
a sothebys spokesman in new york matthew weigman said the 
auction house withdrew the vessel from its tuesday sale of fine 
chinese ceramics and works of art at least two weeks ago he said 
sothebys was holding it pending a resolution of the dispute between 
the owner and the chinese government 
weigman said the owner had requested anonymity and that sothebys 
withdrew the artifact after receiving a description of the missing 
museum piece from a representative of the chinese government 
the vessel was made during chinas warring states period from 
475 bc to 221 bc a period of conflict among rival princes 
before what is now northern china was unified under the first 
emperor 
xinhua said the vessel and 226 other chinese antiques have been 
on display at sothebys in new york since thursday but weigman said 
the vessel was not publicly displayed 
the xinhua report said chinese police identified the dui from a 
color photograph in a sothebys catalog which did not identify the 
owner and said it was expected to sell for 60000 to 80000 
chinese police say the dui in the catalog is identical in shape 
decoration and patina spots to one that was stolen june 4 from the 
qu yuan museum in zigui county in central chinas hubei province 
the thieves were never caught 
the dui was excavated in the county in 1983 
an expert at beijings palace museum said craftsmen at the time 
the piece was made were unable to cast identical bronze pieces 
millions of dollars worth of artifacts are smuggled out of china 
each year mostly through hong kong some are stolen from museums 
but most are discovered by peasants in their fields or by tomb 
robbers and the sites are wrecked before archaeologists can study 
them 
weigman said an auction would actually be the worst possible 
place to dispose of a stolen object because the process which 
includes the publication of photographs and detailed descriptions of 
every item is so public

witness in the joel steinberg murder trial to claim to have 
witnessed steinberg hit his illegally adopted 6yearold girl 
charles scannapieco said steinberg whacked the girl for no 
apparent reason while she was asleep in scannapiecos arms on oct 
23 1987 while they were driving in a car 
demonstrating the blow scannapieco slammed the back of his hand 
against the bench of the trial judge state supreme court justice 
harold rothwax the judge steinberg and the jurors seemed startled 
steinberg a 47yearold disbarred lawyer is on trial for murder 
in the beating of lisa steinberg whom he illegally obtained from a 
long island teenager he smiled and shook his head as if in 
disbelief at scannapiecos dramatic gesture 
steinberg denies that he hit the child he says she fell 
unconscious after choking on food she had thrown up the night of 
nov 1 1987 and that he caused bruises on her chest and back while 
trying to revive her 
his former livein lover hedda nussbaum who was dropped as a 
defendant and is scheduled to testify against steinberg also filed 
a 3 million civil lawsuit that was served monday on steinberg 
the lawsuit alleges that steinberg used humiliation 
brainwashing drugs and the withholding of food to teach nussbaum 
that she was a worthless person who could only be saved through 
his wisdom and special powers 
scannapieco indicted on federal narcotics charges said he and 
steinberg were driving together because he had hired steinberg to 
represent him at his arraignment in albany the following morning 
oct 24 1987 
the witness said the child was cold in the car and he allowed her 
to snuggle against his chest for warmth after 10 to 15 minutes she 
fell asleep 
right after she fell asleep scannapieco said right out of 
the clear blue sky mr steinberg took his hand and went 
demonstrating the blow smash 
scannapieco said the slap was enough to bring tears to your 
eyes but she didnt show any reaction whatsoever except to 
open her eyes and look at steinberg 
scannapieco said steinberg told him he hit the child because she 
sometimes slowed her heart and her breathing putting herself into a 
near coma

the state department after a decade of 
accepting foreign service job applications from blind people has 
ruled that diplomacy is not a suitable profession for them 
the decision was a disappointment to avraham rabby who has 
passed five state department entrance examinations since 1985 and 
has other credentials that normally would make him an ideal 
candidate for a diplomatic career 
i am absolutely outraged rabby said in a telephone interview 
after the state department informed him that blind people no longer 
will be permitted to take entrance examinations in braille or to use 
outside help 
it is absolutely unconscionable that the rest of the government 
has shown itself to be able to employ blind people constructively 
rabby said the state department is still in the 19th century 
rabby who lives in new york city is a graduate of oxford 
university in england with degrees in spanish and french and has a 
masters degree in business administration from the university of 
chicago 
born in what is now israel 46 years ago he has been blind since 
age 8 he lived for 15 years in england and six months each in 
france and spain and he speaks with the elegantly phrased 
formulations of a man accustomed to intellectual pursuits he has 
his own consulting business helping disabled people find employment 
state department officials agree that they had been following a 
contradictory policy toward the blind allowing them to take the 
written and oral examinations but never accepting them as foreign 
service officers 
the officials insisting on anonymity said a department task 
force ruled recently that blind candidates must demonstrate an 
ability to work with original documents effectively and 
independently 
that meant rabby would not be provided with any materials in 
braille for an admissions test that a reader would not be provided 
for him and he could not bring his own reader with him 
rabby had been taking and passing state department written 
and oral examinations since december 1985 he said his score on his 
written tests had improved each time he was informed of the rule 
change earlier this month shortly before he was to take another 
oral assessment test 
the officials said the policy of rejecting blind applicants after 
allowing them to take admission tests was not as cynical as it might 
seem 
they said blind applicants were routinely advised that permission 
for them to take admission tests did not mean that medical standards 
requiring visual acuity for all diplomats would be relaxed 
the state department view is that all foreign service officers 
must be worldwide available and that a blind person cannot be 
expected to deal with the myriad demands diplomats face 
one official said the united states has facilities for helping 
the blind overcome their handicap but that most foreign countries 
lack such accommodations 
another said that much of diplomacy involves reading the body 
language of foreign envoys during diplomatic discussions such 
gestures as winks and nods form part of the overall message a 
diplomat must assimilate the official said 
rabby said the blind are no less able than sighted people to read 
other peoples language be it silent or verbal 
accepting a blind person for diplomatic service would be a 
terribly unfair thing to do to that individual said another 
official who cited high risk posts such as lebanon as 
particularly inappropriate for a sightless person 
the state department officials commented only on condition their 
names not be used 
kenneth jernigan executive director of the national federation 
of the blind has little patience with such arguments 
everybody says its wonderful what blind people can do so long 
as they work somewhere else jernigan said from his office in 
baltimore 
he said dealing with reading material is the principal activity 
of diplomats and blind people are capable of handling mountains of 
paperwork beyond that he said the blind require no more 
secretarial help than sighted persons 
jernigan added that the federation is prepared to take the state 
department to court but he hopes that course can be avoided 
james gashel director of government affairs for the federation 
said federal law requires that all government and 
governmentassisted programs conduct their employment practices 
without discrimination on the basis of handicap the blind and other 
disabled persons he said must be provided with reasonable 
accommodation to help them overcome their handicap 
but he said the state department wants a general exemption from 
this law because of the unique circumstances under which diplomats 
must work 
he said the last time a blind person threatened court action 
against the state department on the basis of discrimination the 
agency decided on an out of court settlement worth 165000 to the 
complainant 
his account could not be confirmed by state department officials

the pentagon struggling to keep military 
doctors from quitting for better money elsewhere soon will 
establish a hefty bonus system under which some surgeons could earn 
112250 a year while in uniform 
under the program which takes effect jan 1 physicians with 
critical skills now in short supply such as surgeons can boost 
their salaries by up to 20000 a year if they agree to reenlist 
for four years 
smaller retention bonuses will be paid to physicians who 
reenlist for two or three years 
a surgeon who signs up for another fouryear hitch under the 
program would see his total monetary compensation rise from roughly 
92250 a year to 112250 a year 
the department of defense and the congress believe we have 
spotted a problem here in time to do something about it says 
david newhall the no 2 executive in the pentagons health affairs 
office there are other severe nonsalary problems that contribute 
to the loss of military physicians but this is a key start 
congress authorized the new bonus program in the pentagons 
fiscal 1989 budget authorization and earmarked 30 million for the 
effort as long as the defense department meets certain requirements 
the most important was a report to congress by nov 15 comparing 
military and civilian salaries along with a plan for divvying up the 
money among different types of physicians 
another report focusing on military health professionals other 
than doctors is due by dec 1 
newhall said the pentagon met the nov 15 deadline for the first 
report and will meet the deadline for the second the pentagon 
official declined to release the first report but a copy of the 
25page document was obtained by the associated press from other 
sources 
the report concluded that the new bonus program authorized by 
congress is desperately needed because the last major overhaul of 
military physician salaries occurred in 1980 
during the intervening years it said inflation has totaled 35 
percent and the net income of civilian doctors has climbed 47 
percent in some specialties such as heart surgery the difference 
between military and civilian pay now exceeds 100 percent 
the result is a general loss of buying power for all military 
physicians and a significant loss of competitive compensation for 
certain highly paid specialists the report states 
the report said that while losses of experienced physicians were 
widespread the most critical shortages were among doctors with 
specialty skills 
the lure of readily attainable significantly higher pay is an 
attractive incentive for military physicians to leave the service at 
the completion of their obligated service the report said in a 
12month period commencing in 1987 the navy lost 76 percent of its 
trained specialists completing their initial training obligation 
the pentagon said it would use the money authorized by congress 
to pay annual bonuses ranging from 20000 down to 1500 in 
exchange for reenlistment contracts 
the various medical specialties have been divided into seven 
groups for calculating the bonuses based on where the defense 
department is suffering the worst shortages the report said 
the top group includes only two specialties surgery and 
orthopedics the second tier will include anesthesiology 
ophthalmology otolaryngology and urology the third group covers 
radiology and obstetricsgynecology

the nearcollapse of israels largest industrial 
conglomerate owned by the histadrut labor federation has forced a 
rethinking of the pioneering socialism on which the nations economy 
was built 
koor industries with annual sales of more than 2 billion 
controls 150 firms and employs 27000 people making products ranging 
from hightechnology electronics to tires fruit juice and 
refrigerators 
koor lost 250 million last year in october it defaulted on a 
20 million loan from new york bankers trust co and the bank 
demanded its liquidation 
like the successful plan by chrysler corp in the united states 
koor is trying to stave off bankruptcy with a government bailout and 
a courtbacked reorganization plan 
but koors problems are symptomatic of the growing financial ills 
that have afflicted israels economy 
even the kibbutzim the communal farms that were the backbone of 
israels pioneering ideal of sharing work and profits are in 
serious financial trouble the kibbutz industries association 
announced last week that its members were struggling to pay off 4 
billion in debt 
the economic shakes have prompted increasing calls for a more 
capitalistic free enterprise system 
the economy has suffocated stef wertheimer a wealthy 
businessman wrote in the jerusalem post 
israels tradition of work as a source of employment rather 
than a source of profits has failed wertheimer wrote the only 
way to save koor is to turn it into a private enterprise 
even shimon peres leader of the leftleaning labor party which 
controls the histadrut and founded the socialized economy says he 
favors selling off some stateowned companies 
the histadrut and stateowned companies account for up to 40 
percent of israels 35 billion gross domestic product economic 
analysts say 
reducing such concentration could take years said zeev refua 
director of the israel government companies authority which 
oversees the stateowned firms the authority has launched a program 
to privatize many state enterprises within five years 
israels socialized economy began even before the state was 
formed in 1948 
jewish immigrants most from eastern europe where marxist 
philosophy was taking hold arrived early this century with the idea 
that collectively they could build enterprises and recycle profits 
to create more jobs 
they started in construction and their early cooperatives grew 
into solel boneh now the nations largest contracting firm 
histadrut did start as a trade union but with no state it soon 
became apparent that it had to create employers to create jobs 
said efran kleiman an economics professor at hebrew university 
the histadrut which has 25 million members in the nation of 42 
million represents 80 percent of the labor force it employs 
160000 people in its companies 
when the state was founded extensive government involvement was 
needed to build roads water systems and other infrastructure 
it was necessary to build a country kleiman said 
the first steps toward more free enterprise came in 1977 when 
the rightwing likud party came to power and passed reforms that 
dismantled exchange rate controls and removed some trade barriers 
but high inflation in the mid1980s forced likud with labors 
backing to reimpose financial restraints 
economists argue that some of the crisis today is a result of a 
program that began in 1985 to stabilize the economy 
the program has squeezed profits by raising interest rates and 
other production costs while freezing the exchange rate at 16 new 
shekels to the dollar 
most however acknowledge inefficiency and mismanagement 
we feel that if there is no reason the government needs to own 
something it should go said refua 
the government reduced its corporate holdings this year with the 
sale of its paz oil co for 97 million stock has been sold in 
three other companies and a study sets out a fiveyear plan to sell 
or reduce ownership in 24 other firms 
if carried through the government will control enterprises 
responsible for just 15 percent of current production by state 
companies refua said 
according to the koor court reorganization plan the conglomerate 
can become profitable again only with extensive pruning it has 
proposed selling 130 million in assets and dismissing 6000 
employees through 1990 
such moves are unprecedented in a country where workers believe 
they have a right to a job and unemployment has been held to about 6 
percent despite recent economic austerity 
but histadrut economist roby nathanson said it must be done 
even if these difficult steps are not in accordance with the 
historical and philosophical ideas of histadrut we have to try and 
save the healthy parts nathanson said if we dont do it we 
take the risk of losing everything

when the 55 democratic senators meet tuesday to 
select a new leader one of the things theyll be looking to improve 
is the supposedly poor quality of life in the us senate 
dont count on it says the outgoing majority leader robert c 
byrd of west virginia 
addressing complaints from some senators that under his 
leadership the senate met too often and too long into the night 
byrd responded 
i believe first in the quality of work we cant operate on a 
punchtheclock basis i did that once when i was a welder in a 
shipyard 
at age 71 byrd is winding up 12 years as a leader of senate 
democrats including six years as majority leader his replacement 
will be elected in a secret vote by the 55 democratic senators who 
will take their place in the 101st congress next january 
senators being courted for their votes often tell the three 
candidates they want a leader who will improve the quality of life 
in the senate by that they mean fewer long evening sessions and 
erratic schedules that often keep younger men away from their 
families and western state senators away from their home bases 
a majority leader doesnt have many options byrd said in a 
recent interview he has the responsibility to get a legislative 
program in action and to meet the needs of the nation one cant 
adjust the needs of the nation to ones comfort 
byrd displaying a 1988 senate calendar said the senate met for 
137 days this year thats a quality of life thats not too bad i 
dont know how much one can improve on that he said 
the three who would try are daniel inouye of hawaii bennett 
johnston of louisiana and george mitchell of maine 
theres no predicting how the voting will go in the secret 
balloting 
i think no one candidates included has the faintest idea 
whos winning said sen alan dixon dill who has previously 
spoken of the need to improve the quality of life 
inouye is the oldest and most experienced senate candidate at 
age 64 he has served in the senate since 1962 on the watergate 
committee during the collapse of the nixon administration and most 
recently as cochairman of the irancontra investigating committee 
johnston 56 and a threeterm senator has been pushing hard for 
the job for years and tried briefly to unseat byrd in 1986 since 
election day hes achieved near frequentflyer status making the 
rounds of television news shows to demonstrate his ability to speak 
for the party 
mitchell 55 a former federal judge with eight years in the 
senate also is regarded as a strong candidate among those senators 
looking for a new spokesman for the democratic party which now has 
house speaker jim wright at the top despite ongoing ethics 
investigations into his financial dealings 
the balloting tuesday will be held in a locked room in the 
capitol a simple majority is needed to win and if no one can claim 
that after the first ballot the one with the least votes drops out 
and the voting begins anew 
republicans also will be electing their leader tuesday but bob 
dole of kansas has no opposition and is almost certain to return for 
his third twoyear term as gop leader

presidentelect george bush should reduce the 
federal role in public education and let states take the lead 
because states can best respond to the unique needs of their 
citizens a conservative group says 
the heritage foundation in a book to be released next month 
said bush could increase state responsibility for education by 
removing federal oversight authority from federal money for 
specific programs and instead giving solid amounts of money to 
states to distribute as they see fit 
the conservative think tank said federal strings need to be 
detached to restore parental authority and involvement to the 
nations public schools it recommended that parents be given a 
choice as to where their students go to school 
by stimulating competition schools will be immediately forced 
to improve or suffer the consequences the report said vouchers 
and tuition tax credits empower the parent as do state and 
communitysponsored open enrollment plans for public schools of 
choice 
the recommendations written by c ronald kimberling a former 
assistant secretary of education are contained in a chapter of the 
book mandate for leadership iii policy strategies for the 1980s 
the book copies of which have been distributed to the bush 
transition team is the third in a series of policy guides published 
by the heritage foundation the first published after president 
reagan was elected in 1980 was considered a blueprint for the 
reagan administration 
in the chapter on education in the latest book kimberling said 
bush should urge congress to create taxfree savings accounts to 
help lowand middleincome families meet future college costs and 
allow tax deductions for businesses that pay their employees 
college tuition to improve us competitiveness 
ultimately the new savings accounts might reduce demand for 
direct federal student aid and significantly increase the pool of 
private savings he said 
kimberling also urged the bush administration to consolidate all 
federal education programs currently spread throughout several 
agencies within the education department and to give the education 
secretary more authority for planning and coordinating education 
programs throughout government 
the secretary should use his position as the top education 
policymaker to bring to light problems and solutions for education 
reform and use its resources to help states and communities 
improve education programs he said 
the book says the biggest education policy disappointment of the 
reagan administration was its failure to keep or even seriously 
pursue its election campaign vow to abolish the education 
department

the institutional revolutionary party which 
has ruled mexico for almost 60 years is fighting to retain its grip 
even as its presidential candidate carlos salinas de gortari 
prepares to be sworn in 
to overcome public discontent internal party divisions and newly 
aggressive opposition salinas will have to strike quickly on both 
the economic and political fronts after he takes office thursday 
the pri is in a battle to modernize the country and 
itself said juan enriquez the partys international 
communications director 
the pri as it is known for its spanish initials has ruled with 
few challenges since its founding in 1929 interlocked with the 
government in a system that allowed its tentacles to reach every 
nook and cranny of society it turned out the vote and channeled 
favors including highlevel jobs and in many places succumbed to 
corruption 
it also brought decades of stability and expansion to mexico but 
its power has been shaken by a continuing economic crisis that has 
cut the average mexicans earning power by 50 percent since 1980 
salinas scraped by in the july 6 presidential election with just 
over 50 percent of the vote 
in the past 48 years there has not been a transfer of the 
federal executive power in a political crisis like this wrote 
rodolfo gonzalez guevara leader of a reform movement within the 
party in a recent frontpage column in the newspaper excelsior 
still the party remains powerful taking sweeping victories in 
municipal elections in several provinces since october despite 
accusations of fraud most of the wins are recognized as genuine 
for almost 60 years the pris pillars labor peasants and a 
catchall of bureaucrats teachers and others have wheeled and 
dealed sharing leadership power and the rewards of power 
the pri was a type of cushion between the political power and 
the citizens said raul trejo a professor at the national 
universitys social research institute and a labor specialist 
election victories were taken for granted and ensured if an 
opposition candidate or apathy stood in the way by fraud and 
campaigns that could depend on access to state funds vehicles and 
employees 
with transition from a largely illiterate rural population to an 
urban society came a political awakening a desire for more 
competitive elections and an end to corruption in response pri 
governments gave more opportunities including congressional seats 
to the small opposition parties 
adding to the discontent was the jolt of an economic crisis 
brought on by the oil boom and bust outgoing president miguel de la 
madrids sixyear term has been a period of austerity for most 
mexicans 
on july 6 the pri was stung with its narrowest federal election 
win ever setting three firsts 
salinas won with a scant 5036 percent of the vote the first 
time the party got less than 70 percent of the vote it gave up 
senate seats four of the 64 for the first time and it had to 
settle for 260 of the 500 seats in the lower house the first time 
it failed to gain a twothirds majority needed for constitutional 
reforms 
the opposition both the conservatives and the left charged 
electoral fraud and that salinas victory wasnt legitimate 
society changed its not the apolitical society of 20 years 
ago said luis javier garrido who has written one history of the 
party and is working on another 
many opponents were former pri members such as leftist 
presidential candidate cuauhtemoc cardenas who felt theyd been 
dealt out of the circle of power during de la madrids conservative 
administration which introduced free market economic policies and 
attempted to reduce government subsidies 
salinas who will be the 13th consecutive pri president has 
pledged greater democracy and changes to make the party more 
responsive to the needs of the people 
our purpose is to modernize so as to retain our majority 
position and so as not to be weakened and exhausted by 
parliamentary coalitions which always end up by succumbing to the 
rule of the minorities he said in a campaign speech 
even the attempt to open up the party meets tough opposition from 
what are known as the partys dinosaurs the stillpowerful old 
guard 
labor traditionally the sector that could be relied upon to get 
out the vote and maintain stability in part in exchange for public 
offices is a foundation of that old guard 
before the economic crisis unions could negotiate more or less 
satisfactory salaries because they were part of the system trejo 
said but now he said there isnt enough for more salaries or to 
maintain employment levels it means there are more protests 
more than 20 labor candidates lost in the july 6 election recent 
violent incidents including a shootout between rival unions in the 
lobby of one of the citys most luxurious hotels showed either 
defiance of de la madrid and salinas or loss of control by top labor 
bosses analysts said

in the past decade seven south american 
nations pried themselves loose from the dictatorial grip of military 
men 
the march of freedom seemed inexorable 
for the 210 million people in the seven nations ecuador peru 
bolivia argentina uruguay brazil and suriname the return of 
elected civilian government brought substantial personal freedom and 
the restoration of human rights 
now the bright shining shield of democracy is becoming tarnished 
growing disenchantment is evident in several countries mostly 
because of dashed expectations that an end to political repression 
would bring economic improvement it hasnt proved that simple 
nonetheless democracy continues to enjoy substantial allure 
spreading into the few remaining enclaves of authoritarian rule 
chiles citizenry rallying behind the slogan the joy is 
coming voted to end gen augusto pinochets 15year tenure as 
president and hold elections in december 1989 
only tiny paraguay run by aging authoritarian alfredo 
stroessner since 1954 remains totally outside the democratic fold 
and despite the occasional rattling of sabers and a few dramatic 
but isolated and abortive barracks revolts in some countries few 
observers feel a military coup is likely anywhere on the continent 
when you have inflation of 1000 percent a year you obviously 
get unhappy people but that doesnt mean theyre inviting a return 
to military rule said paul sigmund a politics professor at 
princton university and an expert on the latin american armed forces 
the military doesnt have a solution to these problems he

disproved by their own experience 
in most south american countries economic mismanagement or 
corruption by the politically inexperienced armed forces contributed 
to the return of civilian rule but some of the new civilian 
governments have not proven much more adept at handling the 
continents most urgent and persistent problem grinding poverty 
peru is considered the most volatile example the inflation rate 
is expected to surpass 1000 percent the economy is stagnant and 
little if any headway has been made in improving the plight of a 
hungry peasantry that feeds the ranks of a maoist guerrilla 
organization the shining path 
president alan garcia was considered one of perus new generation 
of charismatic leaders when he took power in 1985 but his 
popularity has plummeted because of what critics see as a 
vacillating economic policy especially since he alienated 
conservative parties and businessman with a plan to nationalize 
foreign banks in 1987 
a recent survey by a limabased polling firm datum found that 
60 percent of peruvians dont believe a military coup is likely 
before garicas term ends in 1990 but 28 percent do a sign that 
democracys foundations are less than rocksolid 
if our problems continue to degenerate and if our institutions 
continue demonstrating ineffectiveness the totalitarian temptation 
will visit us sooner or later said a peruvian political analyst 
luis pasara 
brazil and argentina also are plagued by economic and social 
instability with skyhigh inflation rates and tens of thousands of 
workers striking daily for better pay paralyzing many basic 
services such as transportation and the mail 
brazilian newspapers publish regular reports of government 
corruption nepotism and waste retired gen joao figueiredo the 
last in a series of military presidents who ruled from 1964 to 1985 
told citizens to forget me when he handed over power to a 
civilian now he says he is besieged by supporters asking him to 
return to office 
a popular bumper sticker in bustling rio de janeiro wistfully 
recalls military rule i was happy and i didnt know it 
president raul alfonsin of argentina another charismatic symbol 
of democracys return when he assumed office in 1983 was shouted 
down by hecklers during a recent speech and his radical party trails 
the peronist movement in popularity as the nation prepares for 
elections in may 
but such open expressions of dissent and dissatisfaction reflect 
perhaps the most attractive aspect of life under the new 
democracies freedom of expression and action has been a pledge kept 
by the new governments 
most labor strikes take place unchallenged and the mass media 
suffers few if any restrictions the systematic arrest torture and 
killing of dissidents that took place when troops kept order under 
military rule has been replaced by respect for basic civil and human 
rights

participation in party politics labor federations and other 
social groups both pro and antigovernment is active and 
broadbased across the continent the problem according to some 
analysts is that such groups often work at crosspurposes 
the primary problem in south americas democratic 
reconstruction is the capacity to stabilize the political system 
said the chilean political scientist juan somavia and the 
capacity to stabilize the political system depends on achieving 
basic accords among political parties and the different social 
sectors 
until a country achieves a working stable political system the 
possibility of a coup will remain present said somavia he is 
president of a latin american study group sponsored by the academy 
of christian humanism 
somavia cited uruguay as an example of a new democracy where 
political arrangement is basically working under julio 
sanguinetti who took office in 1985 and is considered one of the 
most widely respected new presidents uruguays political labor and 
business groups have reached a basic understanding that has provided 
stability and economic improvement 
bolivia also is often cited as a democratic success story 
president victor paz estenssoro has overseen an economic austerity 
program that slashed annual inflation from an astounding 20000 
percent to about 10 percent 
the bolivian reforms were painful and politically risky with 
thousands of workers at unprofitable staterun mines laid off and 
new taxes imposed but the governments predictions of stability and 
growth are slowly coming true and as bolivians prepare for new 
presidential elections in may no one considers a coup even remotely 
possible in what traditionally has been south americas most 
political unstable country 
not that the military hasnt made its presence felt paz 
estenssoros predecessor hernan siles suazo was kidnapped by 
police and military officers in 1984 but freed hours later because 
of a vast public and official outcry 
in ecuador gen frank vargas pazzos of the air force led two 
shortlived revolts in 1986 before the government arrested him a 
year later his followers abducted president leon febres cordero and 
held him for 11 hours freeing him only after an amnesty was granted 
to the rebellious vargas pazzos 
two brief but dramatic garrison revolts in argentina in 1987 and 
1988 were defused when president alfonsin agreed to limit human 
rights trials of soldiers 
in each crisis it is widely accepted that the civilian 
governments emerged strengthened 
and although military rumblings persist experts contend there is 
a new less threatening tenor 
the saberrattling is now related to issues that directly 
affect the armed forces as an institution such as human rights 
trials and military spending said sigmund he said they no longer 
are taking public issue with general government policy or 
presenting themselves in the role of national saviors as they did in 
the 1960s 
sigmund said he does not subscribe to the notion of an inevitable 
political cycle of military and civilian rule 
the pendulum has stopped swinging he said 
according to somavia the military also lacks the broadbased 
civilian support for a takeover they enjoyed during the social 
turmoil that affected many south american countries two decades ago 
they have less social force he said no one is asking for 
a coup 
but somavia called the antagonistic relations between the 
military and civilians a central problem that is going to be with 
us for a very long time reestablishing a constructive 
relationship in which the armed forces fully accept civilian control 
is something you cant accomplish in one government

a monthlong spate of incidents involving us 
military forces has touched a raw nerve in japan provoking outraged 
newspaper editorials and a sharp protest from the government 
on okinawa the southern island where 35000 us troops jostle 
for training space with 12 million japanese residents civilians 
complain that houses were hit by bullets in october and two teargas 
canisters exploded at a nightclub nov 19 the canisters sent scores 
of people into the street coughing and choking 
the teargas incident which us marine corps authorities said 
was under investigation came one day after the abrupt transfer of a 
us navy skipper his ship had embarrassed the navy command by 
firing practice shells that hit about 1000 feet from a japanese 
coast guard vessel 
the navy immediately expressed regret for the shelling which 
occurred in japanese waters near the entrance to tokyo bay on nov 
9 but the japanese government reacted strongly 
japans foreign ministry lodged a protest with the us embassy 
while several major newspapers published blistering editorials 
the mainichi shimbun daily called the shelling the result of 
the unbelievably slack discipline and lack of moral concepts of the 
us forces in japan 
said the asahi shimbun it would definitely be risky if things 
of this sort were left as they are even a single miscalculation 
would endanger human life besides it would gravely affect the ties 
of genuine friendship that exist between the united states and 
japan 
about 64000 us troops are in japan under a security treaty 
that obliges the united states to help defend this country with an 
added major role in security for northeast asia the treaty also 
obliges japan to provide the bases and training areas needed by the 
us forces 
the vast majority of the japanese support the usjapan security 
treaty and the countrys antiwar constitution which give the 
united states a prime role in defending japan 
but this country never was occupied by foreign troops until its 
defeat in world war ii and japanese are sensitive to the us 
presence 
leftists demonstrate against visiting us ships that may be 
carrying nuclear arms and the public reacts strongly when a 
dangerous accident involves us forces or when the bases appear to 
be encroaching on japanese life 
the us navy base at yokosuka wants to build more than 800 
apartments but faces resistance from the neighboring town of zushi 
which has repeatedly elected a mayor who opposes taking forest land 
for the military housing 
on okinawa prefectural gov junji nishime has blamed a string of 
troubles on something wanting in the us militarys chain of 
command or a decline of discipline 
us commanders on the southern island are reportedly reviewing 
safety measures following a forest fire that occurred in a training 
area in october and the discovery about the same time that a 
residential area near a marine corps firing range had been hit by 
bullets even though firing on the range is supposed to be in the 
opposite direction 
two foreign ministry officials went to okinawa on thursday to 
meet with us generals inspect the firing ranges and talk to local 
officials 
ministry spokesman yoshifumi matsuda said the local peoples 
attitude was a crucial element in the presence of the bases and 
was important to the wider issue of usjapan security relations 
okinawans also have asked that some land now in us bases be 
returned to civilian use for the growth of the islands tourist 
industry about 20 percent of the islands 300350 acres is 
controlled by us forces 
an okinawa official who requested anonymity said there were 
numerous small annoyances like parachutists landing by accident in 
someones backyard or losing equipment that plummets to the ground 
things may not be completely improved in a day or two but we 
understand that the us military is at least trying the official 
said in a telephone interview 
the foreign ministry commended the navy for relieving cmdr 
frederick h michaelis jr as captain of the guided missile 
destroyer uss towers which fired practice shells in japanese 
waters but the ministry spokesman said japan was still awaiting a 
full report from the us government 
the us command said it was reviewing its investigation of the 
towers incident and would not comment until the review was finished 
pending the review michaelis was reassigned to shore duty at the 
yokosuka base

luis known in the rebel ranks as commandante johnson he was a 
good boy but its difficult one son is dead and the other is 
away 
the divisions in the fley family are common in nicaragua site of 
a 7yearold civil war that has pitted brothers against brothers on 
the battlefield 
hundreds of thousands of people have fled leaving behind loved 
ones for reasons varying from repression to opposition to the 
10yearold leftist government 
fley 83 and his wife teodora 68 raised 14 children in 
matagalpa a northcentral mountain city in addition to enrique 
who was killed and luis with the contras two are officers with 
the sandinista army

he was riding luis 37 once a staunch sandinista supporter left 
nicaragua almost eight years ago to join the contras 
they are not alone 
christiana chamorro runs the opposition newspaper la prensa 
while her sister claudia chamorro is the sandinista ambassador to 
costa rica 
brother carlos fernando chamorro edits the official sandinista 
newspaper barricada their other brother pedro joaquin supports 
the contras 
the defense ministry spokeswoman lt col rosa pasos is the 
sister of marta sacasa who until recently was a contra spokeswoman 
finance minister luis carrion one of nine members of the 
sandinista directorate is a nephew of arturo cruz a former contra 
directorate member 
the fleys are deeply religious rural folk retired farmers who 
typify the majority of nicaraguans divided between the 
ussupported contras and the sovietbacked sandinistas 
one of our sons died because of the war and another is away we 
cant solve this said mrs fley sitting on a rocker in her 
sparsely decorated home 
mrs fley hasnt seen her son luis since he left in 1981 she 
spoke with him by telephone after enrique died last january

away from all that i meant that i was away from the battlefield i 
later found out sandinista intelligence chief ricardo wheelock

phone her son to plead for his return 
her husband his white hair tucked beneath a faded blue cap 
recalled why luis left 
he sold coffee at a low price so the other salesmen said he 
was selling to the contras thats a lie they were going to kill 
him fley said he knew it was better to leave 
the 37yearold rebel commander interviewed at the contra camp 
in august said he had questioned the freedom and equality promised 
by the sandinistas and was put in prison in 1981 
why did they have everything and we in the rural regions 
still had nothing i took the rifle i used to fight against somoza 
and fought against the sandinistas he said 
id like to go back to my country he said 
when told that her son had recently been seen at a rebel camp in 
honduras mrs fley gasped if you see him please tell him we are

nasa began the countdown early monday 
for launching the space shuttle atlantis on thursday with five 
astronauts and an intelligencegathering satellite 
the clock begin ticking at 1201 am est as test director jerry 
crute issued the traditional call to stations that summoned more 
than 100 controllers to their computer consoles in the launch 
control center four miles from the launch pad 
were pressing on the countdown has started said george 
diller a nasa spokesman 
the call also was a signal for workers at the pad to begin 
servicing the main engines and removing work platforms from around 
the base of the spaceship 
because the mission is classified the defense department and 
nasa are disclosing few details of the flight a brief statement was 
issued sunday describing the preparations completed earlier in the 
day with the inspection and closure of the engine compartment 
us officials are mum on the length of the flight and what the 
astronauts will be doing in orbit but the official soviet news 
agency tass said sunday the missions main task is to put a new 
generation reconnaissance satellite codenamed lacrosse into 
nearearth orbit 
the satellite will conduct surveillance of the territory of the 
soviet union with the help of updated radar tass said in a report 
from moscow 
the pentagon plans to deploy in the next few years four other 
similar spy satellites which will play the role of an eye for the 
new strategic bomber b2 known as stealth the soviet agency said 
as for the timing of the launch thursday reliable sources have 
said that it should take place about 7 am est if weather and other 
conditions are adequate but officials will say only that launch is 
scheduled to occur sometime between 632 am and 932 am they say 
they will make the time public when the clock reaches the 9minute 
mark 
a preliminary weather forecast for thursday was not favorable 
calling for overcast sky brisk winds and a chance of showers 
once atlantis reaches space nasa plans only two public 
announcements the first four hours after launch will report 
briefly on the condition of the spaceship the second will be a 
24hour advance notice on when the astronauts will land at edwards 
air force base in california 
the silence will be broken only if a serious problem develops 
the pentagon contends the secrecy makes it more difficult for 
soviet satellites and spy ships prowling off cape canaveral to 
monitor the flight and learn its purpose 
critics argue that such secrecy is unnecessary because the 
soviets with their intelligence capabilities undoubtedly already 
know a great deal about the mission and that once atlantis 
satellite is in its own orbit the soviets will be able to track it 
precisely and know what it is doing 
the satellite reportedly will gather extremely sharp radar images 
of military targets as it follows a path that will carry it over 80 
percent of the soviet union 
the five military astronauts who will fly the mission are 
scheduled to arrive here monday from their training base in houston 
to make final preparations for launch they are navy cmdr robert l 
gibson the commander air force lt col guy s gardner the pilot 
and air force col richard m mullane air force lt col jerry l 
ross and navy cmdr william m shepherd 
the flight will be the 27th for the space shuttle the third 
dedicated totally to the military and the second since the 
challenger explosion that killed seven crew members in january 1986 
following the accident nasa held up flights for 32 months while 
management and hardware changes were made 
discovery and a fiveman crew returned the shuttle to space with 
a flight that began sept 29

though clarence charlton is homeless he knows he 
has a warm and dry place to sleep as long as he doesnt mind 
waking up several miles away from where he laid his head down 
charlton like hundreds of new yorks street people calls the 
citys subway system home and officials say they expect the numbers 
to surge as winter sets in 
i can always get on the subway i usually have the fare said 
charlton 78 a former mental patient who was wearing a blackknit 
cap grimy pants no shirt a sweater and tweed coat one day last 
week bedroom slippers failed to cover his swollen feet 
in the daytime im out on the bench and at nighttime i get in 
the subway he said lighting a cigarette butt which he says 
helps his asthma in bad weather ill go underground 
charlton had company that day at the 179th street station in 
queens another homeless man was at the other end of the platform 
and at least eight already were on the e train when it rolled up to 
start its run to manhattan 
as the winds get colder new yorks subways are drawing ever more 
homeless people the attraction a warm relatively safe 
environment all for a dollar trains like the e line whose route 
never goes above ground are particularly popular because they stay 
warmer 
for many riders the disheveled and often unbathed passengers are 
not welcome on the nations largest transit system 
they stink theyre dirty they can smell up a whole train 
said passenger bernard nashofer 
transit police walk a thin line rousting homeless people who 
cause trouble but letting the others sleep maintenance crews find 
themselves cleaning the kinds of messes that subways werent meant 
for subway passengers learn to select cars by scent 
in response the metropolitan transit authority approved a plan 
last week to hire the volunteers of america a social service group 
to patrol subway platforms and trains members plan to talk to the 
homeless and offer them the groups shelter as an alternative to 
sleeping underground but many homeless people shun shelters saying 
they dont feel safe in them 
last summer the transit authority estimated there were 1400 
people using its trains and stations as home advocates for the 
homeless say thats far too low an estimate and the authority 
admits the number will be much greater this winter 
the problem is not unique to new york but mainly is an issue 
only in cities where buses and subways run all night in los 
angeles transit officials say many homeless people drifters and 
alcoholics ride buses from one end of the line to the other all 
night long 
because the homeless situation has increased in the community 
i would expect public transit would get its share said leilia 
bailey transit director of the southern california rapid transit 
district 
there is no policy against riding the buses over and over as long 
as people pay the fares she said new yorks transit system also 
has no such ban 
on a manhattanbound e train at midnight one day last week at 
least 18 homeless men and one woman were sleeping among them was a 
grayhaired man with a cane and a man face down over four seats his 
right foot in a cast and his crutches under the seats 
an asian man with few teeth in his mouth and few english words in 
his vocabulary wrapped paper napkins around a bleeding hand i 
hit he explained another man had his head wrapped in a black 
scarf topped by a fakefur cap and a hard hat three large 
suitcases surrounded him 
its like a hotel on wheels said robert torres a 
27yearold platform conductor 
eight years ago youd see one or two in the whole train now 
youll see six or seven in one car he said 
constantine sidamoneristoff a lawyer who is on the transit 
authority board of directors said the transit police must exercise 
more authority over the homeless 
if theyve paid their dollar they have a right providing they 
comport themselves with dignity he said but if they take up 
several seats urinate defecate then they should be removed 
but transit police chief vincent del castillo noting that 
homelessness is not a crime said criminals and farebeaters 
take precedence among his force of 3800 
one homeless man said he had little choice but to use the transit 
system as his home 
theres no other place you can stay in the winter said ray 
smith 31 its safer in the street than it is in the shelter 
this is one of the few places where you can live in harmony and 
its clean

economists predict that prime minister brian 
mulroney just like presidentelect george bush will have a short 
honeymoon unless his new government can bring down the budget 
deficit 
concern about the deficit is troubling forecasters in both 
countries despite the canadian economists general optimism produced 
by the favorable election outcome for the canadaus free trade 
agreement 
the canadian dollar strengthened once election uncertainty was 
out of the way but prices declined on the toronto stock exchange for 
two days after the nov 21 balloting 
i think its a similar situation to what happened in the united 
states patty croft economist for burns fry ltd said the 
overriding concern is the budget deficit 
the election gave the mulroneys progressive conservative party 
its second consecutive majority government and cleared the way for 
final parliamentary approval of the trade agreement the pact 
already ratified by washington would eliminate most trade barriers 
between the two countries 
the agreements benefits however are expected to be most 
visible over the long term 
economists say a canadian decision to back away from the 
agreement scheduled to start taking effect jan 1 would have 
negative repercussions but positive impact will be less easy to 
spot in the short term 
business expansion in canada as in the united states has lasted 
for six years and the debt per capita in canada is higher than in 
the united states raising fears of higher inflation and a possible 
recession 
during mulroneys first term canadas government deficit fell 
from a record 318 billion in the 198485 fiscal year to an 
estimated 24 billion for 198889 
finance minister michael wilson has said it will be reduced 
further to 237 billion next year although economists caution it 
could go higher if interest rates increase more than the government 
planned and growth is lower 
were in no better shape than they are marc meagher of 
merrill lynch canadas research department said he said the markets 
in both countries are looking for signs that there are credible 
plans to reduce the deficits 
croft at burns fry noted that among industrialized countries 
only italy exceeds canada with a higher rate of deficit to gross 
domestic product the gross domestic product is the value of the 
nations annual output of goods and services excluding returns from 
investments abroad 
the scotia banks forecasts say real gross domestic product 
growth will slow from 40 percent last year and 43 percent in 1988 
to 25 percent next year more dramatically it predicts business 
investment will drop from 88 percent in 1987 and a soaring 183 
percent this year to 61 percent in 1989 
the ottawabased private conference board of canada which 
surveys 14 economists projected growth of 42 percent for 1988 
slowing to 23 percent next year 
james frank the boards chief economist said the slowing growth 
rate was due to the bank of canadas policy of high interest 
rates the longevity of the current expansion now at 23 quarters 
and a weaker housing industry 
thirteen of the 14 economists surveyed said they expected 
inflation and interest rates to increase next year 
the board found a consensus that the slowdown will not slip into 
a mild recession but frank said the risk is certainly rising 
inflation is projected to be 41 percent this year and increase 
to 50 percent in 1989 
the prime minister announced rapidly after his victory that 
wilson will stay on as finance minister 
we know better than to spend the country into recession 
mulroney said at a toronto appearance thursday night we will 
maintain our commitment to gradually reduce the federal deficit 
it wont be easy

emergency shelters house a growing throng of 
homeless americans but the need now in the words of a national 
academy of sciences study is for a stable residence for those 
who have none in other words permanent housing noting that 
federal funds for lowincome housing have been cut by more than 
threequarters since 1981 advocates say the need for lasting 
shelter is critical some see potential in unused governmentowned 
houses and in the shells of oncesturdy buildings that stand vacant 
in inner cities 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
taxpayers around the nation own tens of thousands of houses 
standing empty at the same time tens of thousands of american 
families with nowhere to live overflow shelters and haunt the 
streets 
now the homeless and some of the publicly owned vacant homes are 
being brought together in a project that is housing families from 
the minnesota cold in a clandestine effort to renovate and occupy a 
dwelling in chicago in new york citys restoration of entire 
tumbledown blocks 
activists while encouraged are pressing housing officials to do 
more and a major decision could come in federal court next week 
they say the government is skirting a law that pledges available 
space to those without homes 
i think thousands of buildings could and should be usable 
said robert hayes counsel for the national coalition for the 
homeless in new york a city that owns mostly through tax default 
5000 empty apartment buildings with many times that number of 
apartments and has an estimated 60000 homeless people 
one of the abandoned buildings was on leggett street in a sorry 
corner of the south bronx a national symbol of blight 
one of the homeless was susan thomas placed in a shabby welfare 
hotel room in manhattan a few years ago with her two sons then 6 
months and 2 years old after she split from their father and ended 
up on the street 
i used to cry cause i didnt want to be there she says 
their hotel room was broken into and drug dealing and fear were all 
around 
after 18 months she boarded a city van for leggett street to 
look at an apartment in a building that had been restored 
i wasnt expecting anything like this the 24yearold woman 
said talking to a reporter in her tidy bright twobedroom 
apartment her boys playing across a room thats still mostly bare 
of furnishings it was ms thomas day off shes a clerk in a 
nearby store 
her building whose tiled entrance foyer smelled of cleaning 
fluid had been a ruin not long before 
another bronx site still is but not for long workers there are 
gutting five buildings that occupy a whole block to create 220 
apartments for families like the thomases 
vince campisi construction supervisor outgrowled the demolition 
equipment as he described getting started you literally couldnt 
get in for the junkies crack vials by the garbagepailful 
leading a reporter on a tour campisi crunched up rubblestrewn 
steps to the remains of what a parlor its ceiling was burned 
through to the sky a green upholstered sofa stood upended in a 
corner the windows let in a drizzle no airconditioning 
needed he deadpanned 
still he and others said fixing up buildings that landlords have 
abandoned is often cheaper than new construction in places like new 
york the guttingandrehab job that campisi is overseeing is to 
cost the city 15 million how much would comparable new buildings 
cost maybe 50 million he guessed 
halfway across the country in minnesota the vacant publicly 
owned houses being readied for the homeless look different 
in duluth a threebedroom ranch house that had reverted to the 
department of housing and urban development when its owners failed 
to make payments on a federally backed loan is being readied for a 
family that has been on the streets 
were offering properties that are in good condition said 
patricia mack of the hud office in minneapolis which hopes by next 
spring to lease 15 houses rentfree to nonprofit groups that house 
the homeless 
such efforts have strong support according to a survey earlier 
this year by the national housing institute a nonprofit think tank 
based in orange nj one thousand adults were surveyed by phone 
eight in 10 favored rehabilitating old and vacant buildings for 
homeless americans who number 450000 to 3 million estimated by 
the government and advocacy groups respectively sixty percent said 
theyd willingly pay an extra 120 apiece in taxes each year to 
expand housing efforts 
the need for permanent housing cannot be met says a 
september report by the national coalition for the homeless without 
an increase in the federal budget for lowincome housing 7538 
billion this year down 77 percent from 1981s budget of 322 
billion

beyond dollar allocations however an enormous pool of unused 
federal property in the words of us district judge oliver 
gasch in washington is not even being considered for use by the 
homeless despite a yearold law requiring that surplus government 
property be made available for them 
gasch made that observation in issuing a preliminary injunction 
two months ago stopping hud the veterans administration and three 
other agencies from disposing of federal property that is eligible 
for use under the 1987 stewart b mckinney homeless assistance act 
to maria foscarinis a lawyer representing the national coalition 
in the suit it seemed very peculiar that agencies all over the 
united states when pressed to list unused or underused property 
found only 12 parcels and to date have turned over only four to 
groups aiding the homeless 
there are literally tens of thousands of pieces of property 
across the country we cant be watchdogs on every one thats why 
we need an aggressive order she said referring to hopes of a 
permanent injunction at a hearing before gasch on dec 5 
the winter is hard upon us the judge said noting the 
urgency of the case in a nov 18 hearing on a request for an 
updated complete list of underused property what the court is 
fundamentally interested in is to make some housing available 
for these people 
he added i know bureaucrats the thing youve got to do 
with bureaucrats is crack the whip and see to it that they do the 
job 
not included under the mckinney acts broad mandate are thousands 
of houses the federal government owns through default on mortgages 
that it guarantees 
nevertheless advocates sought in a separate lawsuit to stop the 
sales of those houses until they could be considered for use for the 
homeless they were turned down by gasch and an appeal is pending 
in fiscal 1988 hud sold 80164 of these foreclosed homes at an 
average price of 38000 
currently hud holds more than 45000 properties according to 
department spokesman rod hiduskey who noted that the sales revenue 
goes mainly into a fund that repays lender banks that hud has 
guaranteed against loss 
hud officials argue that the fund would be bankrupted by 1990 if 
sales were stopped 
there are federal programs that discount house prices for 
homelesshelp agencies like ms macks in minnesota and the 
agencys urban homesteading program hiduskey said 200 federally 
owned homes have been sold at 10 percent below market value under 
another program for the homeless 
advocates say its not enough 
homes have been disposed of with agency coffers in mind and 
not national housing goals asserted the report from the national 
coalition for the homeless by and large programs to divert parts 
of the inventory to aid the homeless are unpromoted and unused 
as a result some advocates have grown more militant 
michael marubio of the chicago coalition for the homeless said 
that group is secretly rehabilitating an abandoned hud apartment and 
will turn it over to a homeless family 
later on well have a housewarming party and well ask hud 
officials and anyone else who wants to come he said 
nor is the federal government the only public landlord of vacant 
housing 
according to checks by the associated press as many as 60000 
vacant or nearvacant dwellings may be in local government hands 
because of tax delinquency 
besides new york citys roughly 5000 empty and 4000 partly 
occupied buildings there are 6500 in philadelphia 3000 in 
detroit 1600 in washington dc and smaller numbers in boston 
denver miami and other cities say housing officials 
in chicagos cook county 41000 residential properties have been 
declared tax delinquent for more than five years according to 
barbara grau of the chicago rehab network a coalition of nonprofit 
developers 
if america put its mind to it said marubio we could house 
the homeless 
in the last three years the boston public facilities department 
has turned 12 abandoned buildings out of 100 into shelters for the 
homeless 
the purchase of 50 houses from the veterans administration is 
part of a 31 million philadelphia plan to provide 490 units of 
permanent housing for the homeless 
in new york city by 1993 every vacant cityowned building 
that can be rebuilt will be renovated already or in a program to 
rebuild said catie marshall of the city department of housing 
preservation and development 
in 1986 mayor edward koch announced a 10year housing plan 
costing more than 5 billion but that plan meant to produce 
housing for many income groups should be redrawn to direct more of 
the money toward the homeless says andrew scherer a lawyer 
representing an advocacy group housing justice campaign in a suit 
against koch 
even so the plans provision for rehabilitating old buildings 
instead of constructing new ones economically makes sense 
scherer said 
if those squeezed out of homes because of high prices and other 
factors are to be saved from the streets he said the vacant 
abandoned stock that the city has taken title to is the key

the countdown began today for 
thursdays launch of shuttle atlantis which will carry five 
astronauts and a secret satellite that reportedly will gather 
military intelligence over the soviet union 
the clock began ticking at 1201 am est as nasa test director 
jerry crute issued the traditional call to stations that 
assembled more than 100 controllers at computer consoles in the 
launch control center four miles from the launch pad 
the call also was a signal for workers at the pad to begin 
servicing atlantis engines and removing work platforms from the 
base of the spaceship 
were pressing on the countdown has started said george 
diller a national aeronautics and space administration spokesman 
because the mission is classified the defense department and 
nasa are disclosing few details of the flight including its length 
and what the astronauts will be doing 
as for the launch time sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity have said it should take place about 7 am est if weather 
and other conditions are adequate but officials will say only that 
launch is scheduled for sometime between 632 am and 932 am 
thursday they say they will make the time public when the clock 
reaches the nineminute mark 
a preliminary weather forecast for thursday called for 
unfavorable conditions overcast sky brisk winds and possible 
showers 
atlantis crew all military officers planned to fly here this 
afternoon from their training base in houston to make final 
preparations for launch instead of making the usual arrival 
comments to the news media they have been advised to say nothing 
the crew commander is navy cmdr robert l gibson the pilot is 
air force lt col guy s gardner and the mission specialists are 
col richard m mullane and lt col jerry l ross of the air force 
and navy cmdr william m shepherd 
after atlantis reaches orbit nasa plans only two public 
statements the first four hours after launch will report briefly 
on the condition of the spaceship the second will be a 24hour 
advance notice on when the astronauts will land at edwards air force 
base in california 
the silence will be broken only if a serious problem develops 
defense department officials contend the secrecy makes it more 
difficult for soviet satellites and spy ships operating off cape 
canaveral to monitor the flight and learn its purpose 
critics argue that such secrecy is unnecessary because the 
soviets with their intelligence capabilities already know a great 
deal about the mission 
in fact the official soviet news agency tass said sunday the 
main task of the secret mission is to put into nearearth orbit a 
new generation reconnaissance satellite codenamed lacrosse the 
satellite will conduct surveillance of the territory of the soviet 
union with the help of updated radar the pentagon plans to deploy 
in the next few years four other similar spy satellites which will 
play the role of an eye for the new strategic bomber b2 known as 
stealth 
us critics also say that once atlantis satellite is in its own 
orbit the soviets will be able to track it precisely and know what 
it is doing 
much already has been published about the satellite based on 
reports from sources who say it will gather extremely sharp radar 
images of soviet military targets as it follows a course that covers 
80 percent of the soviet union 
the flight will be the 27th for a us space shuttle the third 
dedicated totally to the military and the second since the 
challenger explosion that killed seven crew members in january 1986 
the challenger accident kept the shuttle fleet grounded for 32 
months discovery and a fiveman crew had a successful flight that 
began sept 29

an agriculture department analyst says that in 
the wake of this summers drought demand for rail cars and river 
barges has kept shipping prices at relatively high levels 
navigation on the upper mississippi river has nearly returned 
to normal said tq hutchinson of the departments economic 
research service rain has restored most channels and reservoirs 
to navigable depths although they are still low 
the rivers carrying capacity was still low going into this 
falls harvest and barge operating costs are still high and the 
lesser flow forced authorities to limit the number of barges 
permitted in a single tow 
grain shipments on the illinois and mississippi rivers during 
july and august averaged 3 million tons per month down 30 percent 
from may the month before navigation was impaired and 17 percent 
below june 
some of the reduction stemmed from limited barge capacity but 
reduced exports also contributed hutchinson said in the current 
issue of agricultural outlook magazine 
according to export inspection figures for june july and august 
monthly grain exports averaged about 20 percent below may shipments 
through mississippi ports dropped 16 percent to 140 million bushels 
in june rose slightly to 144 million in june and then to 148 
million in august 
barge rates meanwhile were up from a year earlier by about 24 
percent during the first five months of 1988 in june as river 
problems developed the rates soared at peoria ill rates to new 
orleans averaged 1744 per ton compared with 637 the week before 
hutchinson said the hike was shortlived although the average for 
all of june was 986 per ton up 59 percent from may by august 
rates were down to 761 only 45 cents more than the januarymay 
average however prospects for large corn sales to the soviet union 
pushed barge rates above 10 again in september 
in late june he said the burlington northern railroad announced 
a series of increases to achieve barge competitive rates for 
hauling wheat for shipments to new orleans for example the new 
rates would have amounted to an additional 197 per rail car in 
august and a further increase of 276 per car in september a 26 
percent increase from june 
for some destinations the rates announced by the burlington 
northern would have driven up rail rates in december to 80 percent 
above last june hutchinson said 
when announced the rate hikes appeared likely to prevail 
because demand for rail service was record high and the drought had 
sharply curtailed barge capacity hutchinson said moreover 
other railroads were expected to raise their rates by like amounts 
but rates for grain remained nearly level during july and august 
as demand for rail services declined sharply he said preliminary 
data showed in fact that grain rates actually fell slightly in 
july and then edged back up in august to their june levels 
hutchinson said that burlington northerns rail rates for october 
and november based on sales of transportation certificates may be 
up less than 2 percent from august and that they could decline in 
december certificates are fixedprice contracts for service to be 
provided in future months

orville l freeman president of the 
agriculture council of america says one of the most important tasks 
for the incoming bush administration should be the formation of a 
new third world policy 
since world war ii multiple government and private programs 
have evolved to deal with economic political and military 
objectives along with a variety of humanitarian and social needs 
says freeman who was secretary of agriculture during the kennedy 
and johnson administrations of the 1960s 
freeman added in a recent council newsletter it is time now 
for the united states in its own self interest to set forth a new 
overall third world policy and restructure its programs to that 
end 
the council is a private nonprofit organization based in 
washington agricultural trade policy and programs are among its 
interests 
freeman said the council and many others would like to push 
agriculture trade and development policy to a high position on the 
agenda of the bush administration 
certainly if this country is to renew its historic position in 
international trade new attention must be paid to a third world 
that even in the 1980s has accounted for one dollar in every three 
in us foreign sales 40plus percent in the case of farm 
products he said

the doctor who now oversees the nations 
medicare program and who may play a role in the next administration 
says he sees no conflict between george bushs desire for a kinder 
america and indications the presidentelect will seek major medicare 
savings 
of all the list of problems of our health care system i for 
one dont believe one of the problems is too little money william 
l roper said in an interview last week the problem is were not 
spending as best we could the money we are spending 
bush pressed by reporters about his budget chiefs assertion 
that medicare cuts are likely to be a part of a deficitreduction 
drive said only that he wants to make the program more 
efficient 
roper head of the health care financing administration has a 
working relationship with several members of bushs staff including 
deborah steelman the vice presidents chief health policy adviser 
during the campaign 
prior to the election steelman offered one example of how bushs 
socalled flexible freeze on federal spending might affect 
medicare given the spiraling cost of health care in general she 
said medicare might grow by 8 percent while other programs were 
held below the general inflation rate 
in last weeks interview roper threw out the same hypothetical 
figure to illustrate possible spending for part b the portion of 
medicare that pays doctor bills and has been growing at about 15 
percent a year 
its the idea of saying in 1989 were going to spend what we 
spent this year plus 8 percent and thats all were going to 
spend he said thats all there is there aint no more 
whatever the final approach both democratic and republican 
health experts in congress agree that part b is ripe for scrutiny if 
only because of its headlong growth 
despite widespread criticism that reagan administration cuts in 
medicare spending threatened the welfare of the nearly 32 million 
elderly and disabled americans covered by the program the thrust of 
the approach has been to cut into the profits of providers such as 
hospitals rather than reducing benefits 
roper the first physician to head the medicare program 
acknowledges that the next target will be doctor fees and that the 
outcry will be intense 
hcfa is the favorite fourletter word of the health care 
community and i think it is probably always going to be that way 
he said ruefully 
still he said it makes no sense for me as a political manager 
of this huge program to say were going to willynilly spend money 
write a blank check to whoever and at the same time be confronted 
with the present reality of the problems in the health care system 
and no dollars to do anything about it 
among those admitted problems he said are infant mortality 
rates higher than other industrialized nations lack of full access 
to health care for 37 million uninsured americans and inadequate 
longterm care programs for a rapidly aging population 
if the kinder gentler america is going to be able to respond 
to the problems the vice president has seen weve got to have some 
money to do it with said roper if the flexible freeze is going 
to work then on average programs have to go at the inflation rate 
and if weve got problems like part b of medicare that are growing 
at several times the inflation rate something has got to give 
he acknowledged that wringing significant savings from the 
program will not come quickly 
the eventual answer he maintains is getting more value for 
dollars spent which requires a more questioning attitude to the way 
medicine is practiced a highly emotional topic for doctor and 
patient alike 
up until recently the presumption has been if a doctor orders 
it it must be necessary it must be effective he said now 
were saying maybe so maybe not and lets get the information 
together to judge that question 
to support that approach roper recently established programs to 
accumulate massive amounts of data on which procedures and tests 
work and which dont with an eye toward possibly revising medicare 
payment policies 
while the hcfa job is widely acknowledged to be one of the major 
no win posts in the health bureaucracy roper said hes had a 
ball serving there 
he is guarded about his prospects during the bush administration 
i am a longtime admirer and supporter of george bush and wish 
him every success he said if there is some way i can be 
useful in this department id certainly like to hear about it

as engineers struggle with the aging plants 
that now produce us nuclear weapons material energy department 
officials are drawing up plans for two new safer reactors expected 
to cost a total of 68 billion 
one proposed design the smaller and more expensive of two 
envisioned involves technologies that some engineers believe will 
lead to commercial reactors that drastically reduce the dangers of 
meltdown and contamination 
building new reactors has assumed new urgency since april when 
engineers last were able to safely operate the remaining three 
production reactors at the savannah river plant near aiken sc 
we feel that we can make the plants at the savannah river plant 
operate safely although they are nearing the end of their 
operational lives said ron cochran head of the energy department 
office for the new reactors 
the first of the savannah river reactors is not expected to 
resume production of tritium a critical nuclear weapons material 
before january the new reactors should begin operation in about 
1999 said cochran 
however persuading congress to approve funding for both reactors 
may be impossible given the budget deficit and the 110 billion the 
energy department says it will need to clean up the existing complex 
and make it safe 
an energy department advisory panel in a report last july found 
that one of the challenges was to get a new production reactor 
built before the savannah river plant reactors reach the end of 
their useful lives said cochran 
the energy research advisory board recommended building two new 
reactors a heavywater reactor at savannah river for an estimated 
32 billion and a gascooled reactor at the idaho national 
engineering laboratory reservation an energy department site near 
idaho falls idaho for about 36 billion 
the point of having two is to provide the maximum level of 
assurance at two geographic locations so that nothing like a 
seismic event could shut down production said cochran 
like the three existing reactors the new one at savannah river 
would use heavy water as a moderator it have new safety and design 
features but rely on tritium extraction techniques that have been 
proven since 1954 
the new savannah river reactor would be adequate to make all of 
the tritium needed for nuclear weapons and the gascooled reactor in 
idaho would produce at half that rate 
both would be built with containment vessels steelreinforced 
concrete domes like that which prevented the escape of nearly all 
the lethal materials from the three mile island accident in march 
1979 the current savannah river plant reactors rely instead on 
thick concrete walls and airfiltration systems to confine 
radioactivity 
despite its smaller production capacity and igher cost the 
gascooled reactor planned for idaho has many advantages 
in highpressure lightwater reactors fuel can reach 4100 
degrees fahrenheit hot enough to melt the casing and turn the fuel 
into an uncontrollable molten mass if the flow of cooling water is 
interrupted 
in a gascooled reactor meanwhile uranium grains can reach a 
maximum temperature of 3000 degrees fahrenheit while the shells in 
which they are encased do not deteriorate below 3300 degrees 
making a meltdown or radiation leak theoretically impossible even if 
the flow of coolant stops for an indefinite period 
the gascooled reactor at idaho falls also could generate dollars 
by generating commercial electricity through the year 2038 cochran 
said 
lawmakers from south carolina and idaho already are beginning to 
maneuver to make sure that their states are not left out as plans 
for the reactors move forward 
sen strom thurmond rsc at an oct 5 hearing before the 
senate armed services subcommittee on strategic forces and nuclear 
deterrence said he wanted to commend the department of energy on 
its recent decision to locate the new production reactor at the 
savannah river plant and would keep an eye on its progress 
but idahos sen james mcclure also a republican has charged 
energy department officials at the south carolina field office with 
suppressing a 1985 report on problems at savannah river in order to 
derail plans for a new production reactor elsewhere 
if the facts had come out in 1985 mcclure said in an oct 7 
speech on the senate floor we would be breaking ground right now 
on a new production reactor and it would not be at savannah river 
the energy department is holding local hearings near the proposed 
sites including one scheduled for tuesday in aiken

six years after he last taught at tufts 
university john sununu remains on the school faculty in what one 
official calls an extremely rare arrangement that allows his 
children to receive tuition waivers and other aid 
sununu the new hampshire governor chosen to serve as white house 
chief of staff in the bush administration last week declined to be 
discuss the arrangement but said last summer i never asked for 
any different treatment this was all done by the board of 
trustees 
sununu has had two children enrolled in tufts since he left the 
university and also has children attending the massachusetts 
institute of technology in cambridge mass and stanford university 
in palo alto calif 
the children attending tufts are granted full tuition waivers and 
those at other colleges receive tuition subsidies from tufts as part 
of faculty benefits sununu has received during his six years on 
leave from the school according to tufts officials tuition at 
tufts in the 198788 school year was 11750 
an official who oversees faculty benefits at tufts said general 
school policy is to grant leaves for up to two years 
but policies governing such extended leaves by faculty at private 
colleges and universities vary greatly with the longest leaves 
generally granted to professors who quit their academic posts for 
highprofile government assignments 
sununu announced in may that he would not seek a fourth term as 
governor and has spent much of his time since then working for bush 
during the presidential campaign he served as a chief bush surrogate 
attacking the record of massachusetts gov michael dukakis the 
democrats nominee 
in announcing that he would not seek another term sununu cited 
his 68000 a year gubernatorial salary as too small his wife 
specifically said college tuition bills were a factor in her 
husbands decision to leave his post 
as white house chief of staff sununu can earn up to 89500 
according to government pay scales 
tufts officials confirmed sununu remains on leave from his 
tenured teaching post in the mechanical engineering department but 
referred most questions about the circumstances of his leave to 
president jean mayer who did not return repeated messages from the 
associated press 
mayers secretary said the school president told her he would 
have no comment on sununus status 
sununu said last summer he intended to eventually return to 
teaching at tufts but had not discussed a date with school 
officials in the schools latest catalog published in aug 15 
1988 sununu remains listed as an associate professor of mechanical 
engineering 
why not he answered when asked if he believed it was 
appropriate for his children to continue to receive tuition waivers 
and assistance from tufts 
attempts to reach sununu this week to discuss his status at tufts 
were unsuccessful jerry little the governors spokesman said 
wednesday that sununu did not have time to conduct an interview 
children of tufts faculty members and most other colleges and 
universities are allowed to attend that school free of charge 
tufts policy also allows children of tufts faculty to receive 1250 
a semester for a maximum of 2500 a year to help pay their bills at 
any other accredited college according to bernice segal academic 
affairs officer at tufts 
whether those benefits are extended to faculty members on leaves 
varies from school to school according to an informal survey of a 
dozen private colleges and universities 
sununu said he believed his children at stanford and mit received 
1250 a year from tufts he said he did not believe as ms segal 
said that they were eligible for 2500 
the school citing confidentiality guidelines refused to say how 
much assistance was given to sununu children attending schools other 
than tufts but it released the amount which they are eligible to 
receive 
ms segal to whom all questions about faculty benefits were 
referred said all benefits are available to faculty on full leaves 
including health and disability insurance sununu does not receive a 
salary from the school 
she termed it rare for a faculty member to be granted a leave 
of more than two years and extremely rare for a leave to be 
approved for five years or more 
a department chairman must recommend a faculty member for a leave 
and the recommendation must be approved by the schools dean she 
said leaves are reviewed annually she said 
tufts spokeswoman rosemarie van camp disputed parts of ms 
segals account and said extended leaves are routinely given to 
faculty members who enter the foreign service an apparent reference 
to those who leave tufts fletcher school of law amp diplomacy for 
diplomatic jobs 
ms van camp said she could not recall any current or former 
faculty member except sununu who had been granted an extended leave 
while holding elective office 
frederick c nelson dean of tufts school of engineering said 
sununus leave was not an action of my office i suppose he asked 
for it to be continued but that was handled by the presidents 
office he referred all other questions to mayer 
sununu joined the mechanical engineering faculty at tufts in 1967 
and remained in the post until he was first elected new hampshire 
governor in november 1982 
his daughter cathy graduated from tufts in 1982 while sununu 
still was teaching there 
another daughter elizabeth graduated in 1983 the first year of 
her fathers leave of absence and first year as governor 
a third daughter christina a graduate of the university of 
vermont is currently enrolled in a graduate program at tufts 
according to school officials who refused to discuss her specific 
course of study 
sununus son john attends mit and another son james attends 
stanford

if clothes make the man an inmate with 
nothing to wear but stained jeans and a tshirt doesnt cut a very 
impressive figure in court 
assistant public defender connie mcghee says her clients 
wardrobes have troubled her for years by last spring she had seen 
too many of her clients many in jail since their arrest come 
poorly dressed to court 
so ms mcghee and another essex county public defender melody 
merola organized a clothes service in a hall closet 
i decided why not have a few things here at the office 
ms mcghee recalled we call it the pd boutique the name 
stuck 
defense attorneys say they know clothing can prejudice a jury 
and they are wary of clothesconscious judges ms mcghee said shes 
seen clients reprimanded from the bench for improper attire 
i think theres always a difference between a person whos 
neatly dressed as opposed to one who comes to court in cutoffs and a 
tshirt she said a court of law is a place of respect 
with donations from 40 attorneys and the public the closet has 
begun to fill up the office now can loan six suits 17 pairs of 
pants and 20 shirts for men many more clothes are available for 
women but they are a small portion of the offices clients 
located in new jerseys largest city and representing a clientele 
often too poor to post even the lowest bail the public defenders 
clothes service was an immediate hit the lawyers say 
about 15 defendants have made use of the clothes so far and not 
all have returned the garments 
we represent indigent clients and a lot of them really dont 
have very much ms mcghee said when they are arrested they 
are literally arrested with the only clothes they have usually a 
pair of pants and a shirt 
one time i had a guy who came to court in limegreen stretch 
pants and navy blue sweat shirt turned inside out he said he had to 
borrow it from someone else she said 
the public defenders want their clients wearing the kind of 
clothes that walking down the street you wouldnt look at them 
twice ms merola said it becomes very very important that the 
client is afforded the basic dignity of looking decent

americans want military patrols and a crackdown 
on users to combat illegal drugs but many doubt the choice of vice 
presidentelect dan quayle to run the effort a media 
generalassociated press poll has found 
although george bush made a campaign pledge to put his running 
mate in charge of the fight against drugs only 32 percent of the 
1084 adults surveyed said quayle was the right man for the job 
as many werent sure about the selection and 36 percent said 
quayle was not the right choice to lead the drug war republicans 
were more supportive of quayle but fewer than half of them backed 
him as drug chief 
although the bill creating the cabinetlevel drug czar prohibits 
the official from holding another federal post bush has indicated 
he might have the drug czar report to quayle 
the nationwide polls respondents far and away said reducing the 
federal budget deficit should be bushs to priority as president 
10 times as many as picked drugs majorities backed a tax crackdown 
and cuts in defense spending to address the deficit 
the survey also found support for restrictions on foreign 
investments in the united states and broad backing for aggressive 
measures to address the federal trade deficit including higher 
import taxes and quotas 
on drugs six in 10 favored drug testing of all federal employees 
and two in 10 favored testing some of them the government now 
conducts random tests of federal workers in sensitive jobs and has 
proposed testing privately employed transportation workers 
there also was support for other drugfighting efforts eight in 
10 said bush should push for a crackdown on illegal drug users and 
as many or more backed more federal spending for drug enforcement 
education and treatment 
threequarters said the military should patrol the nations 
borders for drug smugglers but considerably fewer 40 percent said 
the military should strike at illegal drug operations abroad 
in addressing the deficit respondents firmly opposed most new or 
higher taxes most also opposed cuts in spending for domestic 
programs such as welfare or a freeze in social security benefits 
strong majorities however supported higher taxes on cigarettes 
and alcoholic beverages and a narrow majority 52 percent favored 
defense spending cuts 
the survey also found overwhelming support for an internal 
revenue service crackdown to collect taxes an approach urged by 
democratic nominee michael dukakis in the presidential campaign but 
ridiculed by bush 
the poll conducted nov 1020 had a margin of sampling error of 
plus or minus 3 percentage points 
those polled were asked what do you think should be george 
bushs no 1 priority once he takes office thirtyfour percent 
said the deficit an unusually high rate of agreement in an 
openended question 
no other category drew a response rate in double digits seven 
percent cited other economic matters 5 percent said poverty or 
homelessness 5 percent said defense and the rest were other issues 
only 3 percent said drugs an issue that ranked far higher in 
importance in preelection polls during the summer but then faded in 
the fall 
respondents gave mixed signals on how to address the deficit 
twothirds for example favored higher corporate taxes but a 
third of that group said they would change their minds if 
corporations responded by raising prices 
opposition to other taxes was stronger eight in 10 opposed 
higher personal income taxes threequarters opposed higher gasoline 
taxes threequarters opposed taxing the social security benefits of 
higherincome americans and 64 percent opposed a national sales tax 
only defense cuts were favored by a majority with particular 
support from liberals and democrats but also backing from moderates 
and independents when respondents were asked specifically if they 
supported cuts in the strategic defense initiative missile defense 
program or star wars 56 percent did 
on the foreign trade deficit 65 percent said the united states 
should impose higher taxes on imports and most said they would hold 
to that position even if it increased prices for some goods and us 
trading partners retaliated

a georgia businesswoman who found love with 
a veteran 82yearold musher through alaskas iditarod dogsled race 
has sold her company to train for this winters arctic race 
carolyn muegge 46 met norman vaughan about three years ago when 
she and a friend attended a party in his honor 
vaughan a retired air force colonel was working with an 
atlantabased expedition to try to salvage seven world war ii 
aircraft buried in greenlands ice pack he drove a dog team during 
one of adm richard byrds antarctic expeditions in the 1930s and 
helped transport wounded soldiers from the front lines in the world 
war ii battle of the bulge 
we were just crashing the party but he made us stay muegge 
recalled in a recent interview 
after about 15 minutes he said i need somebody to be my 
handler over the winter drive up over the alaska highway with me 
can you come 
i thought oh god i had a business to run but here was this 
intriguing alluring offer to go to alaska to spend some time with a 
man like him 
a few days later she agreed and they spent three weeks preparing 
for the 1986 iditarod race over the 1049 miles from anchorage to 
nome 
id never been in the snow here i am this girl from the 
south up there in 17below cold she said 
she rode in a second sled towed by vaughans team during the 
first 20 miles out of anchorage which is required by race rules 
it just killed me when vaughan went on without her she said 
so i decided some day ive got to run a race 
in 1987 she ran her own team alongside vaughan he was kind 
of like my security blanket but they finished last after the 
official time limit expired 
i had a budget rentateam they were a slow team and it was a 
small team and we had some problems along the way and we ran into a 
snowstorm out on the yukon that detained us for four days she 
said 
the couple married dec 31 1987 at vaughans cabin at trapper 
creek alaska all the guests came by dog team or snow machine 
muegge said 
muegge didnt run in this years race vaughan who has been 
mushing dogs for 60 years was the oldest competitor but abandoned 
the race when some of his dogs went into heat he has finished three 
races in 10 tries usually at the back of the pack 
muegge a selfdescribed adventure junkie is a skilled 
whitewater paddler bicyclist outdoor adventurer and judo expert 
she ran executive expeditions in marietta just outside atlanta 
taking corporate executives to the outdoors 
i dont really know what draws me to that sort of thing except 
its the personal challenge to me to see if i can survive she 
said 
muegge sold her business earlier this year she and her husband 
plan to train four months with their dogs for next marchs race 
another woman susan butcher has won the race the past two years 
and is the only threetime winner but muegge isnt aiming to win 
she does hope to improve on her previous effort and beat her husband 
its sort of like you gotta go for it when its there and take 
the opportunity and somehow find a way to do it the worst that 
happens is that i have to start all over again she said

otherwise he maintained the companies could be liable in case 
of an accident caused by aids dementia a complication in which the 
virus attacks the brain and neurological system 
an employee who is unfit for hazardous activity endangers 
himself and other employees richards wrote in septembers issue 
of the periodical put out by the university of denvers national 
center for preventive law 
in jobs such as driving a truck or providing professional 
services an impaired employee may also endanger customers and the 
general public he said 
but researchers dispute richards view that aids virus carriers 
run a significant risk of developing aids dementia particularly to 
a degree that would impair their job performance 
they say too little is known about aids dementia to begin 
regulating it in the workplace 
only a tiny minority of carriers who havent developed other 
symptoms of aids show signs of dementia said bill bailey aids 
policy officer at the american psychological association in 
washington dc 
he added that richards proposal is running the risk of 
discriminating against one population group unduly 
aids dementia was recognized last year by the national centers 
for disease control as a formal diagnosis for aids it can strike 
people who carry the aids virus also known as hiv leading to 
memory loss impaired motor functions and other mental and 
behavioral problems aids dementia is comparable to other 
progressive neurological diseases like huntingtons and parkinsons 
researchers say 
it is most common among people who have developed aids they say 
and studies show up to 90 percent of people who die of complications 
from aids show symptoms of dementia 
richards stressed that little or no danger of spreading aids in 
the workplace exists but he said advanced aids dementia can make 
people unfit for certain jobs just as diabetes epilepsy or back 
injuries can be grounds for denying someone a particular job 
he recommended that employers routinely screen employees and 
job applicants for evidence of hiv infection 
dr joyce kobayashi who counsels many hivpositive patients as 
director of psychiatric consultation services at denver general 
hospital said the data is still very sparse as to how severe 
the manifestations of aids dementia will be 
even if there were some changes its not at all clear the 
dysfunctions would be significant enough to disqualify hivpositive 
people from working kobayashi said 
im not discounting it as an issue but just because hiv may be 
present in the brain doesnt mean a person is demented or that their 
cognition will be affected 
the world health organization in march said there is no 
evidence that asymptomatic hiv1 infected individuals pose special 
problems in safetyrelated occupations 
the who report noted that factors including stress fatigue 
aging psychological disorders and drug and alcohol use can affect 
job performance 
the critical issue is not the cause of impaired job 
performance but the ability to detect impairment whatever the 
cause it concluded 
lynne vance of the national aids network in washington said 
richards ideas contradict a trend where organizations and 
corporations are working out various accommodations so people with 
the virus can stay on in their jobs 
what were finding is that people with the hiv virus are 
functioning very well in the workplace and i think youd be hard 
pressed to find any incidents that would support what he is saying 
richards said having the virus wouldnt disqualify people from 
performing most tasks 
in general adc aids dementia complex would disqualify an 
employee from performing any activity where being drunk or under the 
influence of other drugs would be a disqualification he said 
as a preventive lawyer i think its critical that employers 
learn about these problems before plaintiffs lawyers do

andy answer is a cartoon dog in a 
medical lab coat who dispenses information about aids to school 
children 
he tells kids its ok to be around people who have aids to play 
with them hug them and study with them and he assures them they 
neednt worry about getting aids because they dont share needles 
and arent ready to have sex 
andy answer is the star of a is for aids a new videotape 
for children that will be shown this spring to about 4000 
fifthgraders in the san francisco unified school district 
if kids are playing aidstag in the playground and they 
start thinking some guys going to give them aids by touching them 
we have to do something about correcting it says alissa ralston 
a member of the california department of educations aids advisory 
committee 
several other school districts around the country including in 
california washington state montana indiana georgia are 
considering the tape for children some as young as second grade 
we need to reassure young children who worry about aids because 
of the kinds of comments they hear adults making said joan 
haskin administrator for health programs for san franciscos 
schools this videotape is very positive in good taste with 
appropriate language 
charlotte k beyers a journalist and video producer in palo 
alto made a is for aids with cowriter and director aron ranen 
of los angeles after surgeon general c everett koop urged that aids 
education begin as early as elementary school 
we havent been talking about aids very much at the fourth and 
fifth grade levels because its a sensitive issue says roy 
bueler coordinator of the school library program for the 
29000student tacoma wash unified school district everything 
we looked at was for older people in the work place or in high 
school but this tape looked pretty good for our students 
in the videotape andy takes children on a trip inside a human 
body to explain how the disease works animated ugly germs with 
fangs attack armies of white blood cells led by mustachioed 
generals or t4 cells that direct the bodys immune system 
the animation shows the panicked white cells overcome by germs 
and andy explains that it sometimes takes a long time for people 
with aids to become really sick 
the aids virus destroys the immune system leaving the body 
with no protection against disease and thats why many people with 
aids become very sick and even die 
dr roger peeks assistant dean at stanford universitys medical 
center appears on the tape to explain with an air of authority 
that aids cannot be caught by touching a person or a doorknob by 
swimming sitting on a bus or getting bit by a mosquito 
the tape does not refer to homosexuality its only hint that aids 
can be transmitted sexually is that the children in the tape who 
are about 11 years old arent ready to have sex 
the tape also features visits with two children a 9yearold 
girl in new york born with aids because her mother shared a needle 
with an aids victim and 16yearold ryan white of indiana a 
hemophiliac who got aids from a blood transfusion both segments 
show the children surrounded by family and friends not afraid about 
catching the disease 
of the 78985 aids cases reported since 1981 1257 have been 
children under 13 including 1020 under age 5 according to the 
national centers for disease control in atlanta nine hundred 
seventyseven other children have parents with aids or are 
considered at risk of getting the disease more than 44000 aids 
patients or 56 percent of all cases have died 
its scary stuff said ralston who wrote a parents 
guidebook on aids you dont want your kid walking around worried 
unnecessarily that theyre going to catch this disease at the same 
time you want to let them know what the risks are like if you find 
a needle at the playground you dont touch it thats aids 
prevention for kindergartners

charging too few iranian prisoners of war 
were being returned by iraq iran said it has halted its exchange of 
prisoners from the persian gulf conflict 
tehran radio said in a report monitored in cyprus on sunday that 
irans foreign ministry sent a letter to the international red 
cross sponsor of the exchange demanding the immediate release of 
an additional 67 iranians 
under a nov 11 accord iran and iraq agreed to release up to 
1570 sick and disabled pows in batches of about 150 who would fly 
home aboard a plane chartered by the international committee for the 
red cross 
the 10day operation started thursday but iran freed 52 iraqi 
prisoners instead of 110 due for repatriation that day 
iran said the remainder asked for asylum in iran or recovered 
from their wounds and no longer were eligible for exchange 
in retaliation iraq sent back 19 instead of 41 iranian pows 
the third prisoner swap took place sunday with 52 iraqis and 19 
iranians being released 
by continuing this behavior iraq in effect will keep 
imprisoned many sick and wounded iranian prisoners and their 
release will not be guaranteed the iranian radio quoted the 
letter as saying 
the radio also quoted the head of irans committee for war 
prisoners ataollah mohajerani as saying the continuation of the 
prisoner exchange depends on iraqs release of 67 iranian pows 
the red cross and iraqi officials had no immediate comment on the 
iranian announcement 
unsponsored peace negotiations following an aug 20 ceasefire 
in the eightyear iraniraq war are stalled but the prisoner 
exchange agreement was reached in separate talks with the red cross 
the red cross has registered names of 50182 iraqi and 19284 
iranian pows but estimates the total number on both sides at 
100000 
irans official islamic republic news agency said 22 iraqi pows 
due for release on sunday were ineligible because they had 
recovered from their disability 
the agency also monitored in cyprus said nine others stayed on 
for further medical examinations while three more were granted 
asylum in iran 
irna said only 10 soldiers were among the 19 iranians repatriated 
sunday it described the others as civilians some aged over 60 
who were captured by iraqi troops shortly after they invaded iran in 
september 1980 
before the current exchange the two gulf war foes repatriated 
765 iraqi and 613 iranian sick and wounded prisoners since 1981

chip sprague and his nine plott hounds are having 
trouble finding steady employment guiding wouldbe bear hunters 
despite a resurgence in the states black bear population 
restrictions on guide licenses and the length of the states hunting 
season have limited bear hunts 
nobody makes a living guiding bear hunters with dogs said 
sprague a 36yearold logger from ashfield its got to be 
something you love its for the sport not the money 
spragues job helps pay for his avocation and the costs that go 
along with owning the alaskanbred hounds 
the 500 black bears found in 400 square miles north of the 
massachusetts turnpike between the connecticut river and the 
berkshires form one of the densest populations in new england 
wildlife officials say 
hunters had nearly eliminated the bears in massachusetts before 
the hunting season was trimmed in 1969 from 10 weeks to one the 
third week in november when most bears are hibernating 
but the bears acquired taste for corn which provides them with 
a stable food source began taking a bite out of some farmers 
harvests so in 1982 the state authorized a second week of hunting 
during late september 
unlike the november season when just two or three bears are 
killed hunters are allowed to track with hounds in september 
thirtyfive black bears were killed in september and 32 in september 
1987 
about half were caught with the help of hounds said wayne 
maccallum acting director of the state division of fisheries and 
wildlife 
he said about 1100 bear hunters are licensed in massachusetts 
and each is limited to one bear per season hence the dearth of 
work for hunting guides 
sprague who has tagged or shot about 1000 bears during the last 
15 years said he occasionally guides hunters on sixday excursions 
in british columbia often camping out in the deep woods when a bear 
has led them far from their base camp 
its an extremely strenuous sport he said youre 
following a pack of hounds and you have to go where theyre going 
theyre following the bear and hes going to go anywhere he can find 
to get away 
as a child sprague began hunting woodchucks in his neighbors 
fields lacking for recreation in his rural hometown spragues love 
for the sport grew as his father took him hunting on weekends 
but after hunting in 17 states and all the canadian provinces 
most of the bear chasing sprague does is for wildlife researchers 
who collar bears to track them and analyze their behavior 
i run bears and tree them we let most of the bears we get go 
very few bears do we ever actually harvest he said 
killing female or young bears endangers the population and 
research shows a hound pursuit is preferable to baiting traps and 
stalking 
some farmers in western massachusetts try to bag bears wandering 
into their cornfields by shooting from behind blinds set up along 
paths a bear is known to frequent but by chasing a bear up a tree 
sprague can take the time to determine the animals sex and age 
a still hunter has no way of making that judgment because he 
has three to five seconds to make a shot sprague said they all 
look big to somebody the first time they see one

a hushed candlelight march by 15000 people 
rekindled painful memories of the day 10 years ago when two leaders 
of the citys progressive political revolution were slain by a 
former colleague 
led by the doleful beat of five drummers the procession followed 
the 1mile route along which 40000 people marched on nov 27 
1978 in a spontaneous outpouring of grief hours after mayor george 
moscone and supervisor harvey milk were shot to death 
milk was the citys first openly homosexual elected official and 
a leader of the national gay rights movement 
hope rather than despair was the dominant mood sunday night 
our purpose as a city 10 years after the deaths is to pledge 
that violence will not be the answer in our city mayor art agnos 
told the crowd outside city hall 
agnos ordered the doors to the building kept open through much of 
the night and invited marchers to observe a moment of silence in the 
rotunda 
describing moscone and milk as politicians who wanted to give all 
groups a voice in local government agnos declared to wild cheers 
the doors are open to honor them and you 
a large blackandwhite photograph of the two men was displayed 
inside the building along with portions of the names quilt made to 
honor those who have died of aids most victims of acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome have been homosexuals 
the deaths of moscone and milk i think taught us how to deal 
with death in the sense that we learned not to let grief defeat 
us said chris cunningham 31 
it hurts to remember this but weve learned and its really 
hit home with aids we must all care for each other that no one is 
a reject everyones part of the human race he added thats 
what san francisco is about 
folksinger joan baez who had sung to the crowd on the steps of 
city hall a decade ago sang a folk song about the killing of a 
union activist and the crowd cheered the line i never died 
says he 
memorials for milk also were scheduled in at least 10 cities 
nationwide for sunday and today including washington new york 
kansas city mo atlanta houston and san diego 
former supervisor dan white a conservative catholic who had been 
a policeman and a firefighter killed moscone and milk just before 
the populist mayor had planned to announce he would not reappoint 
white to the board of supervisors seat he had resigned 17 days 
earlier 
under pressure from milk and his newly formed homosexual 
political machine moscone had planned to appoint a neighborhood 
activist instead creating the first liberal majority on the 
11member commission 
white escaped a firstdegree murder charge and was convicted of 
involuntary manslaughter after defense lawyers using what was 
called the twinkie defense convinced jurors that eating junk 
food had diminished whites mental capacity the verdict triggered a 
riot by 5000 people 
white served five years of his 7year eightmonth sentence he 
committed suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning in his garage on oct 
21 1985 19 months after getting out of prison

president corazon aquino said today 
her government was stable despite what the military called a failed 
bid over the weekend to duplicate the mass uprising that toppled 
ferdinand marcos 
col manuel oxales deputy chief of the national capital region 
defense command said troops and police blocked convoys late 
saturday carrying about 1000 civilians into manila he speculated 
many were supporters of marcos now in exile in hawaii 
oxales said convoy leaders planned to surround military garrisons 
in the capital much like the february 1986 people power 
uprising that ousted marcos and propelled mrs aquino to power 
leaflets promised establishment of a constitutional military 
government he said 
police said today five people remain in custody facing charges 
of illegal assembly sedition charges were being prepared against 
the suspected organizer jose ocampo who remained at large 
authorities said 
the situation now is normal oxales said but the military 
is on alert to prevent any further attempt 
mrs aquino told reporters she did not consider the incident a 
coup attempt 
they were just making noises and they wanted to be noticed 
she said i guess people will keep on trying to undermine her 
government but i think they should realize now that the people are 
against them and they will not support them in something like this 
oxales said leaflets confiscated from the convoy offered rewards 
of up to 200000 for the capture of senior military officers who 
remained loyal to mrs aquino 
the armed forces of the philippines is now taking over the 
government oxales said reading fromn the leaflets 
he said the participants appeared to be civilians and there was 
no evidence any soldiers joined the move 
oxales quoted participants as saying they were offered money to 
join the convoy and were told they would attend rallies at the 
presidential palace and elsewhere to protest economic grievances 
participants mostly from agricultural areas near the capital 
were also given liberation bonds that could supposedly be 
redeemed after the new government was installed oxales said 
authorities have foiled a half dozen coup attempts against mrs 
aquino the most serious took place aug 28 1987 when about 2000 
mutineers attacked military and media facilities in the capital 
at least 53 people were killed and more than 300 were wounded 
including mrs aquinos only son benigno aquino iii mutiny leader 
lt col gregorio gringo honasan was arrested in december 1987 
but escaped last april

the central committee the policymaking body of 
the ruling communist party convened today to consider proposals for 
revamping the central governments relationship to the 15 soviet 
republics 
critics say such revisions which come after weeks of controversy 
over proposed constitutional amendments would concentrate too much 
power in the kremlin 
the official news agency tass said today that president mikhail 
s gorbachev was delivering a report to the 300member body but 
gave no further details 
the central committee meeting known as a plenum is a prelude to 
tuesdays meeting of the supreme soviet or parliament but it is 
not known whether it will take up the issue of ethnic unrest now 
sweeping the southern republics of azerbaijan and armenia at least 
six people died in protests there last week 
the news agency said the party meeting is considering measures 
to effect political reform in state development but made no 
mention of the unease in the caucasus 
the proposed constitutional changes have stirred controversy 
particularly in the baltics where the estonian parliament on nov 
16 declared the republic sovereign and claimed authority to 
conduct its own business except in regard to foreign policy and 
defense 
the parliaments in neighboring lithuania and latvia stopped short 
of approving similar measures but activists there still oppose more 
centralized power and are agitating for defeat of the constitutional 
changes 
in addition thousands in the southern republic of georgia have 
protested the proposed amendments and many have expressed support 
for estonias action soviet newspapers have contained numerous 
letters objecting to proposals that readers say could produce a 
dictator 
gorbachev appeared at a saturday meeting of the presidium of the 
supreme soviet and pronounced the estonian action unconstitutional 
saying it must be rejected as mistaken not having any legal 
force 
he said the presidium which is the nations highest executive 
body had made several changes 
none of the reports has given details of the revised plan but a 
special legislative commission recommended conciliatory language to 
remove some of the most oftstated objections 
the news agency said the presidium ordered development of a 
system to widen and protect the rights of the 15 republics that make 
up the soviet union 
tass said the system would secure the political social and 
economic interests of the constituent republics and broaden and 
uphold their sovereign rights in the union of soviet socialist 
republics 
the current law theoretically provides a mechanism for republics 
to secede from the soviet union but moscows hold has been too 
strong for any republic to consider exercising that provision the 
draft constitutional amendments would eliminate the provision 
altogether 
the latest round of violence in azerbaijan has resulted in at 
least six deaths firebombings and reported beatings soviet 
soldiers have cordoned off armenian districts within azerbaijani 
cities 
ethnic fighting in the area began in february over control of the 
nagornokarabakh region which is populated mainly by armenians but 
lies within azerbaijans borders

cardinal john oconnor says the united states 
should let yasser arafat speak if the united nations wants to hear 
him but a jewish group praised the reagan administrations decision 
to deny a visa for the plo leader 
if the un is prepared to listen to someone then i think on 
principle its good to give that opportunity oconnor 
archbishop of the roman catholic church new york archdiocese said 
sunday 
speaking sunday after mass in new yorks st patricks cathedral 
oconnor said i think i can understand both sides but ultimately 
given the greatness of this country and the ease with which we can 
make known our position on various things on principle i would 
rather see us admit people and state what our national position 
is 
but he conceded that whether that should be done in the arafat 
case is complicated 
abraham h foxman national director of the antidefamation 
league of bnai brith issued a statement calling the visa 
rejection a courageous blow by the secretary of state against 
international terrorism and a reminder by the united states that the 
plo still advocates and practices terrorism 
the state department on saturday denied a visa to the arafat 
saying the palestine liberation organization chairman knows of 
condones and lends support to terrorist attacks

a congressional office and the federal 
environmental protection agency are divided over the adequacy of 
cleanup plans for one of the nations worst toxic waste dumps with 
work set to begin in a few months 
under the plan drawn up by the epa a contractor is to dig out 
highly acidic sludge in the fouracre bruin lagoon 45 miles north of 
pittsburgh mix it with lime and soil to neutralize and immobilize 
it and then bulldoze it back in place 
it was our feeling this would be just as protective of human 
health as other measures and would be less expensive said ray 
germann a spokesman for the epas region 3 headquarters in 
philadelphia it can be a permanent remedy insofar as it can 
prevent hazardous substances from reaching the public into the 
forseeable future 
but some independent experts say the cleanup method chosen for 
the old oil refinery dump is a shortterm lowcost and 
lowtechnology effort they say a more permanent solution would be 
appropriate for what is listed as no 3 on the governments priority 
list of 1175 superfund hazardous waste sites 
over the short term it may limit movement of materials from 
the site said joel hirschhorn a senior associate for the 
congressional office of technology assessment who reviews the 
effectiveness of superfund cleanups 
in the long term all such capping and cover systems break 
down and water will get in continued money will have to be put in 
that site and any lapse in vigilance will cause problems he said 
the lagoon is filled with a highly acidic sludge that has the 
consistency of soft asphalt it is composed of oils grease other 
petroleum byproducts solvents and toxic metals and it is saturated 
with several organic compounds and a termite pesticide in 
concentrations far above the epas drinking water standard 
more than 30 homes stand within 500 feet of the lagoon 
pollutants from the dump have not shown up in the wells of nearby 
homes so far the epa has found 
work on the site is expected to begin next spring and last a 
year it will cost up to 5 million with the federal superfund a 
pool of money from petroleum and chemical industries and large 
manufacturers paying 90 percent of the cleanup costs the state 
will pay the rest and will maintain the site after the first year 
bruin residents not only consider the plan sufficient they say 
any cleanup is a waste of money that draws unfavorable publicity to 
their town 
we dont worry weve lived with it all our lives we knew 
thats a place you dont go near said beverly hawk who lives 
within a few hundred yards of the lagoon and whose childhood dog had 
to be shot when it got stuck in the sludge 
i dont care if they do anything or not said betty lou 
moser whose back yard borders the dump we lived here all our 
lives and it never bothered anybody they could have bought the town 
for the money they spent

today that 429 bodies were recovered from stormravaged villages of 
southern thailand in the countrys worst natural disaster in decades 
we need aid from foreign countries he said after an 
emergency cabinet meeting the united states and britain provided 
initial assistance today with relief checks totaling 43400 
floods and mudslides from a week of heavy rains starting nov 19 
struck 12 southern provinces dozens of people are still buried in 
the mud chatichai said

province where mud and thousands of logs cascaded down hillsides 
left barren by illegal logging slamming into houses and crushing 
people 
chatichai today ordered a search for the poachers responsible 
but little has been done despite repeated promises by successive 
thai governments to control the problem which involves widespread 
official corruption 
today the british minister for construction david trippier 
told thai foreign minister siddhi savetsila that britain was 
providing 90500 in immediate assistance he presented siddhi a 
check for 18400 and said urgent steps would be taken to transfer 
the remainder 
this is an appalling tragedy which has shocked and saddened 
the british government trippier said 
also today us ambassador daniel odonohue gave siddhi a check 
for 25000 in emergency aid and said the united states would 
provide 40000 more the additional aid was recommended by a us

soviet president mikhail gorbachev said ethnic 
strife is threatening his program of economic and social reforms 
and he said restructuring is the cure for the violence not the 
cause 
gorbachev was reacting to a wave of nationalist unrest that has 
swept across the country from the baltic republics in the northwest 
to the caucasus in the southwest 
in a related development the policymaking body of the ruling 
communist party the central committee met today to review 
proposals for revamping the central governments relationship to the 
15 soviet republics 
official media said gorbachev was delivering a report today to 
the 300member body but no further details were available 
among the draft proposals before the central committee are 
constitutional amendments that critics say would concentrate too 
much power in the kremlin and eliminate the legal possibility for 
republics to secede from the soviet union 
gorbachev said in a speech broadcast on state television sunday 
that attempts are being made to kindle dislike in the interethnic 
sphere 
this would be disastrous it would put perestroika in 
jeopardy he said referring to his reform campaign it would 
even make some people think that it is perhaps perestroika that is 
to blame for all that 
he said his policy of opening up information and opinion is the 
solution to ethnic tension which exists in many of the 15 soviet 
republics 
gorbachevs remarks come during violent tensions between the 
neighboring southern republics of armenia and azerbaijan and during 
demands for increased autonomy in the baltic republics of estonia 
latvia and lithuania 
he made his speech saturday before the presidium of the supreme 
soviet the nations top executive body 
saturdays session of the presidum struck down an estonian 
declaration of limited sovereignty made earlier this month official 
media reported estonia declared then that it had the right to veto 
soviet laws 
official media said gorbachev acknowledged before the presidium 
that national constitutional amendments he has proposed may have 
angered estonians and others by curtailing local rule 
but his remarks saturday also carried a veiled warning i must 
say we receive a great number of letters from working people in 
every republic with remarks that we are at times too tolerant with 
regard to extremists gorbachev said 
in azerbaijan on sunday two communist party officials were 
reported fired 
soviet newspapers charged that local authorities were not helping 
soldiers halt the ethnic violence in the republic 
rallies of up to 500000 people were reported sunday in baku the 
republics capital 
the military newspaper red star said local officials are not 
helping troops trying to keep the clashing azerbaijanis and 
armenians apart in the azerbaijani city of kirovabad 
at least seven people were killed and 160 injured in kirovabad in 
last weeks violence between the mainly christian armenians and 
moslem azerbaijanis reports have said 
a duty officer at the azerbaijani communist party headquarters in 
the city of baku denied charges that local authorities were not 
helping the military quell the violence saying the party is in 
control he refused to give his name 
ethnic fighting between azerbaijanis and armenians first began in 
february and culminated in last weeks massive demonstrations 
the armenians who dominate the nagornokarabakh region of 
azerbaijan are demanding that it be annexed to neighboring armenia 
tass reported sunday that building materials were being removed 
from a construction site for an armenian workshop and recreation 
center in azerbaijans topkhan natural preserve the official news 
agency said the construction of the center at an armeniancontrolled 
aluminum factory contributed to last weeks unrest

year in workers compensation by a commissioner who ruled her 
husband died of overwork and stress from his numerous state tasks 
commissioner rhoda loeb ruled recently that superior court judge 
frank j kinneys fatal heart attack two years ago was caused by 
stress and overwork from the legion of jobs he performed for the 
state judicial department 
she described kinney as the epitome of the work ethic 
i would rather have my husband than the money said kinneys 
wife joan that means nothing to me he was a very 
selfsacrificing person and we always got along on very little

judge and administrative judge for the new haven judicial district

for the department 
loebs ruling marked the first time in state history that a judge 
was found entitled to benefits under the workers compensation law

opposed the claim 
the state which is appealing had argued that judges are 
appointed officials who do not fit the compensation laws definition

afghan resistance leaders and top 
soviet representatives will meet in the next week to discuss 
exchanging prisoners the withdrawal of soviet troops and postwar 
afghanistan a rebel spokesman said today 
the soviets on sunday held their first direct talks with moslem 
insurgents over the exchange of prisoners of war since red army 
troops began withdrawing from afghanistan in may 
the rebels have offered as a goodwill gesture to exchange 
four soviet prisoners of war for 100 guerrillas said shah mahmood 
of the hardline hezbeislami group he said the offer was made at 
the meeting but the soviets did not respond 
guerrilla spokesmen abdul rahim and ghairat bahir representing 
two rebel groups met four soviet embassy officials including naval 
and air attache col victor belyi at the pakistani foreign ministry 
rahim of the fundamentalist jamiateislami rebel group said 
the soviets wanted talks split between military issues specifically 
prisoners of war and problems such as the political makeup of a 
postwar afghanistan 
rahim refused to divulge details except to say a highlevel 
meeting will be outside pakistan within the next week 
the rebels and the soviets refused to say whether the prisoner 
exchange meeting ended with any commitment on the release of all or 
part of some 300 soldiers moscow has said are missing in afghanistan 
rahim said the soviet delegation wants specifics on prisoners 
being held by the guerrillas and we were trying to tell them 
there are other issues of afghanistan not only prisoners of wars 
they are talking about peace and in the meantime they are 
bringing in new weapons said rahim moscow introduced mig27 
fighter jets and surfacetosurface scud missiles into afghanistan 
in october despite its pledge to remove its forces by feb 15 
we hope this meeting will convince them to start to speed up 
the withdrawal and stop the escalation of the war said rahim the 
soviets were promised that any move seen from the russian side 
will be matched by movement from the mujahedeen or guerrillas 
rahim said 
makeup of the rebel contingent to meet with the soviets has yet 
to be decided although rahim said burhanuddin rabbani the current 
spokesman of the loose guerrilla alliance would meet alone or head 
a delegation 
nickolai portikov of the soviet embassys political section 
refused to confirm or deny the impending meeting 
i am not going to make any specific statements on the future 
he said todays talks ended only with a promise that there will 
be a continuation of meetings portikov said 
rahim said the soviet representative had not been decided either 
but he speculated the job might go to yuli vorontsov the soviet 
ambassador to afghanistan and moscows deputy foreign minister 
shah mahmood said vorontsov was appointed ambassador to kabul 
just for the purpose of talking to the mujahedeen 
there is no other need for such a powerful man to be ambassador 
in afghanistan he said 
in the past month soviet statements from moscow and kabul have 
warned that stepped up attacks by usbacked guerrillas threaten to 
derail a withdrawal of soviet troops 
in an agreement signed in geneva last april the soviet union 
promised to withdraw an estimated 100000 troops from afghanistan 
from may 15 to feb 15 
half left by aug 15 and despite strongly worded warnings by the 
soviet union it promised to meet the february deadline

rival shiite moslem militias resumed 
fighting today killing five people and wounding 15 others in 
clashes despite a syrian shoottokill threat police said 
gunmen of the prosyrian amal militia and the iranianbacked 
hezbollah or party of god fought for 40 minutes before dawn around 
the iranian embassy in west beiruts seaside jnah district 
authorities said 
police said two people were killed and six wounded syrian 
peacekeeping troops then intervened and halted the flareup 
three other people were killed and seven wounded in a 20minute 
mortar duel shortly after midnight in south beirut police said 
the new casualties raised the total to 40 killed and 87 wounded 
since the latest amalhezbollah confrontation resumed wednesday 
the command of the syrian armys 12000man contingent in charge 
of security in west and south beirut set a 1 pm deadline sunday 
for the warring militiamen to withdraw from the streets 
the syrian army has orders to shoot on sight any gunman on the 
streets in beirut and the southern suburbs after the deadline the 
ultimatum said 
police said the syrians have not yet opened fire despite the 
violations 
the leftist daily assafir said today the syrian command was 
seeking to disarm the militias in west beirut and then deal with the 
southern slums 
the newspaper quoted an unidentified highranking syrian security 
source as saying syria will take radical measures least of which 
is the disarmament of beirut and the expulsion of the combatants 
then we will deal firmly with the situation in the southern 
suburbs the source was quoted as saying assafir did not 
elaborate 
the syrian army that intervened in lebanon under a 1976 
peacekeeping mandate from the arab league since has made several 
futile attempts to disarm the militias and end the nations 13year 
civil war 
israel could not disarm the militias when it invaded lebanon in 
1982 to dislodge palestine liberation organization chairman yasser 
arafats guerrillas from their main middle east power base

leaders of the rightwing likud bloc gave prime 
minister yitzhak shamir approval today to make a major concession to 
lure the rival labor party into a governing coalition party leaders 
said 
shamir was scheduled to meet labor leader and foreign minister 
shimon peres today to discuss the proposals israel radio reported 
such a meeting could be a major step toward forming a broadbased 
government similar to israels outgoing cabinet 
the 10 likud ministers decided at a twohour meeting to offer 
labor two powerful cabinet jobs defense minister and either the 
finance or foreign portfolio said welfare minister moshe katsav of 
likud 
likud earlier refused to concede more than the defense ministry 
to the leftleaning labor the turnabout came after shamirs 
negotiations with seven smaller parties bogged down in conflicting 
demands for cabinet posts 
we all believe we should build a government under own 
leadership a government that will lead the country with our 
strength shamir told the ministers according to a party 
statement 
but because we are not only concerned with party interests but 
for the countrys general welfare from this standpoint a 
broadbased government is preferable shamir said 
labor broke off talks with likud last week after likud refused to 
reach a powersharing agreement 
but katzav said after todays meeting of likud leaders now we 
can be more open we are ready to give two ministries which we were 
previously not ready to 
the ministers however made no decision about what foreign 
policy a joint government would have israeli news reports said 
likud would insist that peres be barred from openly advocating an 
international middle east peace conference 
labor legislator benjamin beneliezer said on army radio the two 
parties could find common ground with a proposal for a fouryear 
autonomy plan for palestinians in the occupied territories pending 
negotiation of a final settlement 
beneliezer also said a joint government was needed to break a 
lengthy stalemate in middle east peace contacts without a 
likudlabor agreement there are no possibilities for this he said 
during the election campaign peres called for trading land for 
peace and negotiating under the umbrella of an international 
conference shamir rejected any territorial compromise and urged 
direct talks aimed at granting the palestinians limited autonomy 
in the nov 1 elections likud edged labor 40 to 39 in the 
120seat parliament the rest went to small parties with the 18 
seats won by ultraorthodox religious parties making them possible 
kingmakers in a rightwing coaltion 
likuds decision today left the door open for the party to form a 
government with religious and rightwing factions the party 
statement said 
shamir met today with members of four small parties the torah 
guardians degel hatorah tehiya and the national religious party

former president richard m nixon wrote myriad 
memoranda while in office on subjects ranging from reporters to the 
quality of french wines served at state dinners according to a new 
book 
excerpts from from the president richard nixons secret 
files edited by bruce oudes and published by harper amp row appear 
in people magazines dec 5 issue they show that nixon showered his 
staff and family alike with memos signed the president and often 
referred to himself as rn 
after more than a decade of battling to keep some of his memos 
from the public nixon relented last year and did not object to the 
national archives releasing the majority of the documents 
some examples 
june 16 1969 to domestic affairs assistant john ehrlichman 
on an urgent basis i need the press list before the press 
conference on thursday i intend to start calling on those 
pressmen who are not anti rather than constantly calling on those 
who are trying to give us the hook 
jan 9 1970 to us information agency director frank 
shakespeare what is the situation with regard to the horrible 
modern art in some of our embassies i realize we cant censor this 
stuff but i would like a report as to what embassies have some of 
these atrocious objects 
march 16 1970 to nixon assistant hr haldeman would you 
please have the bordeaux years checked i know that 59 is an 
excellent year even with my unsophisticated taste but my 
recollection is that 66 is one of the poor years the reason i ask 
is that we seem to have a huge stock of 66 bordeaux on hand and i 
wondered why 
june 15 1971 to haldeman marked eyes only in view of the 
new york times irresponsibility and recklessness in deliberately 
printing classified documents the pentagon papers without regard 
to the national interest until further notice under no 
circumstances is anyone connected with the white house to give any 
interview to the new york times without my express permission i 
want you to enforce this without of course showing them this 
memorandum 
july 24 1972 to daughters tricia and julie it occurs to me 
that from time to time you may be asked for anecdotes which would 
relate to some of the political events that have occurred over the 
years on a personal side you might mention some of our 
christmas parties when i played the piano for group singing etc 
always by ear you can say that these kinds of events are not 
publicly known but they have been part of the nixon story that is 
to you most heartwarming 
memos from nixons aides also were among the documents for 
example 
feb 9 1971 from haldeman to nixon deputy alex butterfield 
in seating at state dinners the president feels that henry 
kissinger should not always be put next to the most glamorous 
woman present

foreign ministry officials said today a visit to 
the soviet union by its directorgeneral avraham tamir was not 
authorized by the israeli government 
tamir who arrived in moscow sunday to meet with israels 
consular delegation is the highestranking israeli to visit the 
soviet union since the kremlin cut ties with the jewish state after 
the 1967 middle east war 
tamirs 36hour visit was not scheduled to include meetings with 
soviet leaders said the officials speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
they said the trip was not cleared with foreign minister shimon 
peres or other government leaders and has provoked angry reactions 
mr peres wasnt happy he was very surprised one foreign 
ministry official said speaking on condition of anonymity we 
only heard about this visit shortly after mr tamir took off 
tamir was first reported headed for zaire and mozambique but he 
turned up in moscow traveling on a tourist visa the foreign 
ministry officials said 
he apparently thought there was no need to coordinate it 
because it was a visit of a technical nature but not everyone in 
the ministry agreed with this view the official said 
another foreign ministry source said tamirs action could put 
israel into an uncomfortable position with the soviets it could 
be quite embarrassing if the soviets thought the trip was 
coordinated the official said 
he said the feeling in the foreign ministry was that tamir who 
is expected to leave his post shortly had taken the action to 
generate headlines 
israel sent a fivemember delegation to moscow in july a year 
after the soviet union sent a consular delegation to tel aviv 
the israeli mission located in the dutch embassy has been 
officially limited to looking after the closed israeli embassy 
building and processing visas for emigrants and visitors 
the soviet mission located in the finnish embassy in tel aviv 
has been handling matters relating to soviet property visas and 
passports

romanias communist leaders met in 
bucharest today to review the countrys economic plans until the 
year 2000 the official agerpres news agency reported 
the threeday plenary meeting of the commmunist party central 
committee chaired by leader nicolae ceausescu will establish 
action for fulfillment of the countrys economic and social 
development programs evaluate the current situation in romania and 
specify the political and organizational measures for the future 
work of the party the report said 
agerpres did not say why the meeting originally scheduled for 
september was delayed for two months 
western observers suggested the delay may have been caused partly 
by mounting international criticism of the governments scheme to 
destroy thousands of romanian villages in order to gain more 
farmland for stateowned collective farms 
according to the plan made public in april some 7000 villages 
in romania are to be razed and their residents resettled in new 
housing in socalled agroindustrial centers 
the scheme has met harsh criticism from western governments and 
from neighboring hungary which fears the ethnic traditions of 17 
million ethnic hungarians in romania will be destroyed 
romanian officials recently have appeared to back off from the 
original plan saying fewer villages would be demolished 
another reason for the delay in the meeting may have been 
continued food and energy shortages western visitors to romania say 
such shortages have worsened in recent months 
even bread was hard to find in the capital for a week in july 
romanians and western diplomats in bucharest said 
last month the communist government announced new energy rations 
as the countrys population of 23 million prepared for a fifth 
straight winter of restrictions and hardships 
the decree stipulated that centrally controlled heating systems 
in the apartment blocks where most urban romanians live not operate 
more than four hours on workdays and five hours on sundays 
over the past four winters romanians have experienced drastic 
heating and lighting cuts including daily power cuts lasting from 
two to eight hours

a black nationalist leader freed 
after 12 years in prison today challenged the government to lift its 
ban on his movement and release all jailed activists including 
nelson mandela 
long live the panafricanist congress chanted supporters of 
the outlawed organization as zeph mothopeng its ailing 75yearold 
president arrived for his first news conference since his release 
saturday the government said it freed him unconditionally on 
humanitarian grounds 
for years mothopengs group has been at odds ideologically with 
mandelas african national congress both organizations use armed 
resistance against the whiteled government but the panafricanists 
favor black selfreliance while mandelas larger organization 
supports a multiracial approach 
mothopeng took a conciliatory approach my first task which i 
am going to do everything in my powers to discharge is to unite the 
african people he said we dont look at the color of a person 
we consider his convictions 
in calling for the release of all political prisoners mothopeng 
mentioned mandela and jess masemola a panafricanist congress 
leader 
i am naming them as symbols of all other prisoners of 
conscience who should be out here and working for the return of our 
land mothopeng said they should be released not on the grounds 
of compassion or mercy but because they are held illegitimately 
for several months mothopeng has been seriously ill with cancer 
but he said he would remain politically active 
i issue a direct challenge to president pw botha he 
said let him unban the pac and all other political 
organizations 
mothopeng urged foreign governments to intensify economic 
cultural and sporting boycotts of south africa until the government 
made major political concessions currently the black majority has 
no vote in national affairs 
he declined to assess political changes during his imprisonment 
when the government claims many reforms but he said i am calling 
on the international community not to be fooled by cosmetic change 
the only item we are prepared to negotiate is the return of the 
land and the wealth to its rightful owners 
a former teacher mothopeng advised black students to think 
carefully about using classroom boycotts as a political tactic 
use the schools wisely as an arena for the struggle he said 
wishing students good luck in examinations 
the simultaneous unconditional releases of mothopeng and 
longtime african national congress member harry gwala 69 were the 
latest in a series of government moves apparently aimed at improving 
pretorias international standing 
in the span of a week the government 
announced mandela would not return to prison when he completes 
his recovery from tuberculosis at a cape town hospital officials 
said mandela will remain in custody at a suitable location 
possibly a private home on prison grounds 
granted clemency with lengthy jail terms to the sharpeville

the united states and soviet union today signed an 
extension of their longterm grain agreement providing for the 
soviets to purchase more than 20 million tons of grain and soybeans 
ambassador alan f holmer the deputy us trade representative 
said the agreement extends the grain agreement by two years and 
three months until the end of 1990 the previous agreement expired 
sept 30 
under the agreement the soviet union is obligated to purchase 4 
million metric tons of corn 4 million metric tons of wheat and 1 
million metric tons of corn wheat or soybeans a year at prevailing 
market prices holmer said

news briefing by spokesman gennady i gerasimov 
negotiations on the new agreement began in march in washington 
and the signing today by holmer and soviet deputy foreign economic 
relations minister yuri chumakov concluded the sixth round of talks 
we found the soviets very businesslike and constructive 
throughout the negotiations holmer said by telephone 
negotiations will begin at a time not determined yet on an 
agreement to follow the new accord he said 
the soviet unions grain harvest this year although not 
officially announced is expected to be slightly smaller than the 
210 million metric tons harvested in each of the past two years 
much of the countrys prime graingrowing land was affected by a 
severe drought this summer 
those figures are much higher than the 19811985 annual figure of 
about 185 million metric tons but far below soviet targets the 
1986 target was 232 million tons and the soviet union is trying to 
boost production to 250 million metric tons 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev is trying to reform 
agriculture by giving families and farm workers more responsibility 
and the opportunity for greater earnings 
the soviet leader hopes to encourage farmers to work harder by 
offering them a chance to earn more money and live better

for the second time this month the supreme 
court today refused to grant husbands legal power to prevent their 
wives from having an abortion 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by a michigan man 
who sought unsuccessfully last summer to stop his thenestranged 
wife from ending her pregnancy the justices also turned down a 
companion appeal by a courtappointed guardian of the fetus 
the justices on nov 14 declined to hear arguments in a similar 
appeal by an indiana man 
in the case acted on today carlton lewis attempted to block an 
abortion for his thenestranged wife shawn 
she was granted a divorce on oct 24 she accused lewis of 
physically abusing her refusing to contribute financially or 
otherwise to the support of the household and abandoning her and the 
couples infant son christopher 
lewis 25 a school custodian went to court last summer to block 
ms lewis from having an abortion after he learned she had become 
pregnant during the couples brief reconciliation last july 
court orders barred her from having the abortion for seven weeks 
until a michigan appeals court allowed her to go ahead with the 
operation she had the abortion in october 
the appeals court cited the supreme courts famous 1973 ruling 
roe vs wade which legalized abortion nationwide and a 1976 high 
court ruling that struck down a missouri law requiring spousal 
consent for a wifes abortion 
although the issue of abortion raises important moral 
questions such questions are not applicable to the decision here 
the appeals court said judges must apply the law of the united 
states constitution as announced by the united states supreme 
court 
lawyers for lewis said the appeals court ruling 
unconstitutionally deprived the father of his unborn child by 
sanctioning abortion on demand 
the cases are myers vs lewis 88555 and lewis vs lewis

the tornadoes scoured a fivemile path through the heavily 
populated northern section of north carolinas capital city and its 
suburbs before leaping to neighboring counties along the way the 
tornadoes ripped up devitas town house 
it sounded like a rush of water followed by a bunch of 
shaking devita said the roof was totally gone the patio doors 
were gone and every window was smashed the carpet was rolled up 
like someone was going to replace it 
devita 34 grabbed a pillow and got behind his bedroom door he 
still held the pillow during an interview at a shelter in a central 
raleigh school 
fortysix people stayed at the shelter after the storms hit 
between 1 am and 2 am 
if you felt a big hot hair dryer blowing by you and the whole 
place was shaking apart and if this pillow was the only thing that 
protected your face youd hold onto it devita said calling it 
his tornado pillow 
i had to dig my way out from the corner of the room he said 
i was kind of buried in rubble in fact i later found plaster in 
my ears 
devita left his town house wearing only pajamas he borrowed 
clothes from neighbors a pink jacket from one gray sweatpants 
from another and socks from someone at the shelter he still was 
without shoes 
residents of the complex where he lived were told to evacuate 
because of a gas leak mayor avery upchurch said at midmorning that 
the danger of gas leaks had passed 
devita and others werent allowed to drive out because of the 
leak so they walked and waited for buses to take them to the 
shelter 
elsewhere when the sun rose dazed residents emerged to survey 
the destruction 
my god my god said ellie sprankel as she stood on a ridge 
for a sweeping view of her town house subdivision and an adjacent 
apartment complex in north raleigh 
ms sprankle said she had lived eight years in illinois and was 
accustomed to tornado watches and warnings but had never experienced 
one 
they used to tell me its like a freight train coming but what 
its really like is a train on top of you she said 
carolyn davis surveyed her twostory town house by candle light 
before sunrise a large pine tree had slammed into her roof and its 
top protruded through the ceiling into a bedroom 
my insurance company is going to love this she said one 
month ive been here just one month i cant believe it 
jerry thornton gasped in disbelief when he saw that a section of 
his town house roof was gone 
i didnt need to see that thornton said what a way to end

the supreme court today refused to let a jewish 
organization display a menorah symbolizing the hanukkah holiday on 
the steps of a pittsburgh government building next month 
the justices by an 81 vote turned down an emergency request 
aimed at allowing display of the 18foot menorah 
justice harry a blackmun was the lone vote to allow the display 
the court agreed in october to decide whether displaying the 
menorah at the citycounty building and a christmas nativity scene 
at a nearby government building violate the constitutionally 
required separation of church and state 
that decision is expected by july 
but lawyers for chabad the jewish organization that owns the 
menorah asked the justices to set aside a federal appeals courts 
order that bars its display pending the high courts review 
the menorah had been displayed each year since 1982 
the nativity scene depicting the birth of jesus christ has been 
displayed inside the main entrance of the allegheny county 
courthouse for about six weeks during the christmas season since 
1981 
a federal trial judge refused to order the dismantling of the 
displays when they were challenged last christmas but the 3rd us 
circuit court of appeals ruled by a 21 vote that the displays 
unlawfully promote religion 
the nativity scene or creche is owned by the holy name society 
a roman catholic mens group it has not sought emergency action 
that would allow display of the creche during the christmas season 
this year 
the supreme court in 1984 allowed communities nationwide to 
include nativity scenes and other religious symbols in officially 
sponsored holiday displays 
in that ruling the justices let pawtucket ri officials place 
a creche in a christmas display because such decorations as santa 
claus reindeer and snowmen also were included 
but lower courts since have treated the 1984 decision as a narrow 
one and have disallowed various governmentsponsored christmas 
displays deemed too religious 
the case is chabad vs aclu a384

the us trade deficit shrank by 54 percent 
from july through september the third consecutive quarterly 
decline the government said today 
the commerce department said that the imbalance between imports 
and exports narrowed to 285 billion in the years third quarter 
it was the lowest quarterly deficit since the first quarter of 
1985 and reflected the continued improvement the country has enjoyed 
in trade this year 
the decline followed a revised 143 percent narrowing in the 
second quarter when it shrank to 3015 billion in the first three 
months of the year the deficit had fallen by 146 percent 
for the first nine months of this year the trade deficit has 
been running at an annual rate of 1252 billion down 22 percent 
from the record deficit of 1603 billion in 1987 
economists believe this trend will hold for the final three 
months of the year marking the first annual improvement in the 
countrys trade balance since president reagan took office in 1981 
the new figures confirmed an improvement already evident in the 
departments monthly merchandise trade reports those figures showed 
the deficit declining by 32 percent to 322 billion in the third 
quarter compared to 332 billion in the second quarter 
todays figures are smaller because they subtract such factors as 
shipping costs and military sales from the monthly numbers 
the new report said that us exports climbed 34 percent to 
823 billion it was the seventh consecutive quarterly increase in 
us sales abroad and pushed exports to a record level 
imports also rose but by a smaller 09 percent to 1108 billion 
as a drop in oil shipments helped offset a rise in nonpetroleum 
imports 
the average number of barrels of oil imported daily rose to 754 
million up from 74 million however the average price of a barrel 
of oil fell from 1516 to 1422 the price drop helped to narrow 
the countrys foreign oil bill by 4 percent to 99 billion in the 
third quarter 
offsetting the decline in oil imports were widespread increases 
in car shipments 
foreign car shipments from canada climbed by 12 percent while the 
number of passenger cars from west germany increased 34 percent car 
imports from south korea were up 29 percent and japanese shipments 
rose 16 percent 
the average price of a japanese car edged down by 1 percent while 
the price of west german cars dropped a sharp 18 percent after 
posting big gains for several quarters 
most us export categories showed increases sales of farm 
produce rose 8 percent to 104 billion the highest level since the 
second quarter of 1982 
the increase was more than accounted for by higher prices 
reflecting the drought in the farm belt 
corn exports increased 48 percent and total soybean sales were up 
49 percent 
the average price of corn rose by 30 percent while soybean prices 
were up 28 percent and wheat prices rose 25 percent 
as usual the largest deficit was recorded with japan an 
increase of 100 million to 12 billion for the quarter

the supreme court today allowed prosecutors 
investigating labor union corruption in new york to use subpoenaed 
membership lists obtained from four carpenters union locals 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that the rights of 
the union and its members were not violated by forcing the locals to 
turn over the lists 
a manhattan grand jury in february 1987 issued subpoenas for the 
membership lists of locals 17 135 257 and 608 in connection with a 
probe of the united brotherhood of carpenters and joiners by 
district attorney robert m morgenthau 
the new york court of appeals ruled last july that morgenthaus 
office could keep the lists pending completion of the grand jury 
investigation 
the state court said forcing the unions to turn over the lists 
and allowing the district attorney to keep them for now did not 
violate freeassociation rights of the union and its members 
the union was forced to turn over the names addresses home 
telephone and social security numbers for some 10000 members 
the state court noted that the investigation is aimed primarily 
at highranking union officials but it said some rank and file 
members may also become targets 
the membership lists have a substantial relation to the 
investigation because they will enable the grand jury to locate and 
identify union members the potential witnesses for grand jury 
testimony without unduly burdening or delaying the search and 
without having to proceed through the traditional channels of first 
notifying the union leaders and exposing witnesses to possible 
intimidation the state court said 
the state court added that if the subpoenas were narrowed to 
include only some union members job sites or locals it would 
immediately signal the suspected parties 
also the state court said a more restricted subpoena would make 
it hard for prosecutors to uncover possible witnesses to illegal 
activities such as bribetaking 
the union said the subpoena will chill the rights of members 
because carpenters in new york city will assume a connection between 
being a union member and being called before the grand jury 
that perception will deter people from joining the union and 
discourage members from attending union meetings and engaging in 
robust debate with other members the union said 
the justice departments brooklynbased organized crime strike 
force and the fbi also have been investigating the carpenters union 
in a probe begun in 1984 of the construction industry in the new 
york metropolitan area the investigation has produced numerous 
indictments charging extortion and payoffs from employers 
the case acted on today is local 17 vs new york 88400

undercover federal drug agents have helped smuggle 
drugs and then staged police seizure of the contraband and have 
helped drug manufacturers obtain needed chemicals before arresting 
them newspapers report 
the staged drug seizures represented to news reporters as drugs 
taken from real smugglers helped undercover agents gain the 
confidence of drug lords by convincing the bosses the loss of the 
drugs was legitimate the houston chronical reported sunday 
the colombians the only way theyll believe you is to show 
them the stuff drugs the money or the newspaper clips drug 
enforcement administration spokesman maurice hill said in washington 
the houston post reported today that the dea has given suspected 
drug dealers the required chemicals and even built a drug laboratory 
for one target 
houston attorney philip greene told the post that dea agents 
watched a suspected dealer in dallas make and deliver 
methamphetamines and quaaludes but did not intercept the drugs the 
dealer however was arrested he said 
if the point of the dea is to get drugs off the street they 
violated policy said greene who specializes in drug cases 
im saying our basic goal is to infiltrate drug dealers said 
marion hambrick the dea chief in houston we cant expose what we 
do undercover 
the practice of staging fake seizures and feeding the information 
to reporters apparently began several years ago to resolve a dilemma 
for undercover agents posing as cocaine importers for colombian drug 
lords the chronicle reported 
often dea operatives deliver drugs according to instructions from 
colombian exporters but keep the shipment under surveillance in 
hopes of intercepting it before it hits the streets officials said 
the dea sometimes ensures that a shipment of drugs never reaches 
the street by dropping the load in cooperation with local 
authorities who stage phony seizures and allow the undercover 
operation to proceed without detection the newspaper said 
in 1984 dea agents helped smuggle 952 pounds of cocaine into the 
country then abandoned their van at a prearranged harris county 
roadblock set up by the texas department of public safety on aug 
2 1984 the dps alerted news reporters that troopers had discovered 
a record cache of drugs 
on sept 29 of this year 60 kilograms of cocaine were planted in 
an abandoned car and left to be discovered by the harris county 
sheriffs department which notified reporters 
harris county sheriff johnny klevenhagen praised the bogus 
seizures as very productive in taking illicit drugs off the 
street 
because of its success he said the practice has gained national 
acceptance 
if the dea is willing to lie to the media and public about this 
issue said houston chronicle managing editor tony pederson 
what else might they be willing to lie about 
pederson acknowledged that extraordinary measures are necessary 
to fight drug trafficking but said government agencies must 
maintain credibility 
hill said the technique is used in high drug traffic areas 
including florida and texas 
its a procedure that is used but i cant begin to tell you 
with what frequency its not a new technique i can tell you 
that hill said

the supreme court today refused to block the 
retrial of a federal drug and racketeering case against 10 men 
including the brother of reputed new york crime boss john gotti 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that putting the 
defendants on trial again will not violate their doublejeopardy 
rights 
prosecutors charged the defendants took part in a 
multimilliondollar heroinsmuggling operation 
three defendants gene gotti angelo ruggiero and john carneglia 
have been on trial twice 
the first time a mistrial was declared last january after nine 
months when the government charged jury tampering all 10 defendants 
were on trial in that case 
the second trial involving only gotti ruggiero and carneglia 
ended in july when the jurors failed to reach a verdict 
gotti is the brother of john gotti the reputed boss of the 
gambino crime family authorities describe ruggiero as a captain in 
the crime syndicate and carneglia as a member 
the other defendants are edward lino mark reiter joseph 
lopresti anthony moscatiello oscar ansourian anthony gurino and 
cesar gurino 
the appeal acted on today focused on the first mistrial declared 
by us district judge mark a constantino after he found evidence 
the defendants attempted to identify and influence the jury 
constantino dismissed three jurors from the panel on grounds of 
bias and then said that left an insufficient number to try the case 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals ruled last april that a 
retrial would not subject the 10 defendants to double jeopardy in 
violation of their rights 
the appeals court noted that the disqualified jurors denied they 
had been approached but said they no longer could be impartial 
the trial judge properly could have concluded that leaving 
these individuals on the jury was not a reasonable alternative 
the appeals court said 
the appeals court said the judges finding that there was a 
distinct possibility of jury tampering is enough to warrant a 
mistrial 
the appeals court also said it would be impractical to conduct a 
minitrial to determine whether the allegedly tainted jurors 
actually were influenced improperly 
the case is ruggiero vs us 88374

the supreme court today left intact a north 
dakota law that requires parents who teach their children at home to 
be certified by the state 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by parents who 
said the law violates their right to practice their religion freely 
the north dakota law was challenged by lawrence and deborah 
anderson of jamestown and mark and lynette dagley of mandan 
the couples said they believe that god has given them 
responsibility for their children including their education and 
that sending them to school away from home would violate their 
religious convictions 
the andersons were fined 1000 and the dagleys 500 for 
violating the states compulsory school attendance law 
north dakota requires school attendance for children 7 to 16 the 
law also requires that religious schools be approved by the state 
and that such schools employ teachers who are certified by the state 
the law permits parents who are certified as teachers to conduct 
schools at home for their children 
the north dakota supreme court upheld the statute last june it 
said north dakotas compelling interest in the education of 
children permits some restriction on the free exercise of religion 
the only question is whether or not the state has chosen the 
least restrictive alternative to achieve its compelling interest 
the state court said 
it said north dakota could choose another system such as 
authorizing visits to homes by state officials and monitoring the 
childrens educational process 
but the state court said those alternatives might mean a more 
intrusive role for the state in supervising the religious training 
of children taught at home 
the andersons and dagleys said north dakota is the only state in 
the nation that requires parents who teach their children at home to 
be statecertified 
scientific and educational evidence points unanimously to the 
same conclusion homeschooled children taught by uncertified 
parents are receiving an excellent education they said 
the parents said a lessrestrictive alternative for the state 
would be to require parents to disclose at the outset that they are 
teaching their children at home and then require the children to 
take periodic tests given by public school officials 
the case is anderson vs north dakota 88350

the remains of more than 130 ancient indians 
have been reburied after three years of research provided scientists 
with new knowledge about prehistoric humans in nevada 
the remains showed a record of continuous human occupation of the 
stillwater marshes for at least 5000 years said anthropologists 
and archaeologists at the nevada state museum in carson city 
they said the bones and artifacts also showed that the ancient 
stillwater people were more numerous less nomadic and healthier 
than many scientists originally thought 
the graves of the people believed to be the ancestors of the 
modernday paiute indians were exposed by floods during the 
recordwet winters of 198284 in the stillwater marshes near here 
the bones were quietly reburied in a private paiute ceremony 
earlier this month at an undisclosed site in the marshes 60 miles 
east of reno 
anthropologists were able to identify more than 130 individuals 
the most ever found at a prehistoric site in nevada officials said 
anan raymond archaeologist for the us fish and wildlife 
service at stillwater said that gives the site national 
significance and makes it one of the most important archaeological 
finds in nevada 
sheilagh brooks a university of nevadalas vegas anthropologist 
said the 4000 bones temporarily removed from the marshes could have 
represented as many as 416 people but she said no more than 133 
individuals were confirmed since there were too few bones and they 
were mixed up 
using carbon dating at the university of californiariverside 
scientists found some bones as old as 3200 years and some buried as 
recently as three centuries ago raymond said 
however raymond said the type of artifacts found at the sites 
mainly arrowheads pushes those dates back a couple thousand more 
years 
anthropologists were unable to establish a direct genetic link 
between the remains and the modern paiutes but found a lot of 
similarity in the skulls and faces brooks said 
she said remains of prehistoric indians found at various 
locations in northern nevada including stillwater are quite 
similar to todays indians bigboned what we call wellbuilt 
sturdy people with big noses they show very little change in 
time 
richard hicks chairman of the paiuteshoshone tribe said he has 
no doubts the remains belong to his ancestors 
the tribe still was burying some of its dead in the marshes as 
late as the 1930s he said some of us in our 50s can remember 
that when we were little guys they would take them back out that 
way toward the desert 
the marsh also yielded house foundations hearths roasting pits 
food storage pits garbage heaps and extensive stone tools 
this is not a burial site per se but a bigger picture a 
place where people lived hunted and fished and buried their 
kinsmen raymond said

flattened 
i can remember hearing a big gust of wind like a hurricane and 
then i could hear the wood tearing and i thought oh god this is 
it im gone i just buried myself under the bed said betty bell 
of raleigh who was in bed when a tornado hit

have a tornado watch nor warning before the storm struck he said 
he and raleigh mayor avery upchurch flew over the affected area 
today and upchurch said it looked like a big bouncing ball had 
gone through there

southeastern north carolina in 1984 and caused about 65 million in 
damage city officials said 500 people were homeless 
martin at a 6 am briefing said six people had died but

people in need of help and to prevent looting 
it appears that weve got extensive damage all over the area 
everett said we do have some extensive injuries but i cant tell 
you how many or who or where 
in addition to the flattened apartment buildings numerous others 
suffered structural damages said deirdre bolling manager of the 
coopers pond complex no one in those buildings was seriously hurt 
and residents were given lodging at hotels she said

the supreme court today left intact the current 
system for giving members of congress pay raises 
the court without comment rejected arguments that the process 
which produced a 12000 congressional pay raise last year gives 
too much power to the president to determine salary levels 
the justices also declined to use the case to examine what power 
members of congress have to challenge the constitutionality of 
federal laws 
the system for approving congressional pay hikes established by 
a 1967 law was challenged by sen gordon humphrey rnh and five 
republican house members after congressional pay was raised 12000 
last year to 89500 
the us circuit court of appeals here upheld the payraise 
system last may 31 
the system also controls salary increases for federal judges and 
highranking executive branch officials but the challengers to the 
law did not attack those provisions 
the appeals court said the system is constitutional because it 
allows congress to override salary increases granted by the 
president 
from the founding of the nation until 1967 congress passed 
legislation to set its salary scale 
seeking to share the responsibility for giving itself pay raises 
congress passed the federal salary act in 1967 
the law calls for convening every four years a salary study 
commission appointed by all three branches of government the 
commission makes a recommendation to the president who then submits 
his pay plan to congress 
the presidents recommendations become effective unless congress 
disapproves them within 30 days of receiving them 
the act was amended in 1985 to require action by both houses to 
override the presidents recommendations the original law permitted 
either house to veto a pay hike but the socalled legislative veto 
was declared unconstitutional by the supreme court in 1983 
the appeals court here said the elimination of the legislative 
veto causes marginally increased practical difficulty for 
congress to override a presidential recommendation 
but the fact remains the appeals court said congress is 
afforded the opportunity explicitly to reject or modify any or all 
of the presidents recommendations before they go into effect 
the appeals court also rejected the challenge to the payhike 
statute on independent grounds it said federal courts have an 
obligation not to rule in disputes where congress has the power to 
remedy the problem itself 
the court also rejected an argument that delegating a role to the 
president in setting congressional salaries violates the 
constitutional separation of powers among the three branches of 
government 
challenging the law along with humphrey were reps robert dornan 
rcalif bob smith rnh beau boulter rtexas jack davis 
rill and clyde holloway rla 
they were joined by consumer advocate ralph nader and the 
national taxpayers union 
the reagan administration urged the supreme court to uphold the 
payraise system 
in other action the court 
refused to let a jewish organization display a menorah 
symbolizing the hanukkah holiday on the steps of a pittsburgh 
government building next month 
the justices by an 81 vote turned down an emergency request 
aimed at allowing display of the 18foot menorah 
agreed to referee an important railroad industry dispute 
affecting the ability of railroads to sell off their lines and 
reduce their work forces 
the court said it will use appeals involving the small pittsburgh 
amp lake erie railroad co in pennsylvania and ohio to resolve issues 
troubling railroads and their labor unions nationwide 
for the second time this month refused to grant husbands legal 
power to prevent their wives from having an abortion 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by a michigan man 
who sought unsuccessfully last summer to stop his thenestranged 
wife from ending her pregnancy the justices also turned down a 
companion appeal by a courtappointed guardian of the fetus 
allowed prosecutors investigating labor union corruption in new 
york to use subpoenaed membership lists obtained from four 
carpenters union locals 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that the rights of 
the union and its members were not violated by forcing the locals to 
turn over the lists 
left intact a north dakota law that requires parents who teach 
their children at home to be certified by the state 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by parents who 
said the law violates their right to practice their religion freely 
the congressional payraise case is humphrey vs brady 88352

opec oil ministers today approved a new 
production accord that will sharply cut their output and raise crude 
oil prices 
saudi arabias oil minister hisham nazer emerged from a session 
of the organization of petroleum exporting countries and said the 
deal was formally completed 
all 13 members of the cartel signed the accord which sets a 
target price of 18 a barrel although crude has been selling at 14 
a barrel and less 
analysts have said the agreement which goes into effect jan 1 
and runs for six months could send crude prices climbing by 1 or 
2 a barrel 
each 1 rise in the price of crude oil theoretically means an 
increase of 25 cents a gallon in retail gasoline prices although 
oil companies do not always pass along the full increase 
the agreement sets the cartels total production at 185 million 
barrels a day in the first six months of the year it currently is 
running at 225 million barrels a day 
the ministers aim is to curtail their production in an effort to 
reduce the glut on the market and lift sagging prices 
opec president rilwanu lukman said the accord would have a 
positive very positive effect on the oil market and predicted 
prices could reach 18 a barrel maybe by june 
if all 13 countries curb their production as provided under the 
accord prices will get a strong lift he said 
its a hell of a lot of oil to take out of the market he 
said it should shock the price sharply up very quickly 
saudi arabia had tried to set a minimum price of 15 in the 
accord but that effort met resistance 
nazer said late sunday the saudi proposal was designed to prevent 
prices from falling below 15 but other ministers said the minimum 
price could become the ceiling price 
barkeshli said sunday the saudi proposal was a major divergence 
from opec resolutions so far and could totally sabotage the 
agreement 
iran is not going to accept this type of idea he said 
under the accord each country would be given a production quota 
or ceiling within the total limit of 185 million barrels a day 
many opec countries need more money from their oil sales iran 
and iraq want additional revenues to rebuild their economies which 
were badly damaged in their eightyear war they agreed to an august 
ceasefire 
under the new agreement iran and iraq each will get the same 
quota of 264 million barrels a day 
iraq had been demanding an equal production ceiling with iran 
which repeatedly said no 
under the new accord iran will retain its production share at 
1427 percent of the cartels total output other countries would 
give up some of their share to bring iraq up to the same level as 
iran 
saudi arabia maintains the largest share at about a quarter of 
opecs total output 
under the current accord iran has a cap of 24 million barrels a 
day iraq was given a ceiling of 15 million barrels but ignored it 
analysts estimate its production at 27 million barrels a day 
opec members are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran iraq 
kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia united arab emirates 
and venezuela

a black nationalist leader freed 
after 12 years in prison monday challenged the government to 
legalize outlawed black opposition groups 
zeph mothopeng also urged blacks to unite and he called for 
freedom of all jailed activists including his rival nelson mandela 
long live the panafricanist congress supporters chanted as 
the ailing 75yearold president of the banned organization arrived 
for a news conference it was his first public appearance since 1976 
the government said it freed him unconditionally saturday for 
humanitarian reasons 
for years followers of mothopengs group have been at 
ideological odds with mandelas african national congress both 
organizations train guerrillas to fight whiteminority domination 
but the panafricanists favor black selfreliance while the larger 
african national congress supports a multiracial approach 
mothopeng who quit the anc in 1959 adopted a conciliatory tone 
monday 
my first task which i am going to do everything in my powers 
to discharge is to unite the african people he said we dont 
look at the color of a person we consider his convictions 
in calling for the release of jailed activists mothopeng named 
mandela and fellow panafricanist leader jess masemola as symbols 
of all other prisoners of conscience who should be out here and 
working for the return of our land 
they should be released not on the grounds of compassion or 
mercy but because they are held illegitimately he said 
mothopeng has been seriously ill for months with cancer of the 
thymus gland but he said he would remain active politically 
i issue a direct challenge to president pw botha he 
said let him unban the pac and all other political 
organizations 
mothopeng urged foreign countries to intensify economic cultural 
and sporting boycotts of south africa until the government made 
major political concessions currently the black majority has no 
vote in national affairs 
he declined to assess political changes during his imprisonment 
when the government claimed significant reforms but mothopeng 
warned i am calling on the international community not to be 
fooled by cosmetic change 
the only item we are prepared to negotiate is the return of the 
land and the wealth to its rightful owners he said 
a former teacher mothopeng cautioned black students to think 
carefully about classroom boycotts as a political tactic use the 
schools wisely as an arena for the struggle he said wishing them 
good luck in examinations 
the simultaneous unconditional releases of mothopeng and 
longtime anc member harry gwala 69 were the latest in a series of 
government moves aimed partly at improving its international 
standing 
in the span of a week the government 
announced mandela would not return to prison when he completes 
his recovery from tuberculosis but will remain in custody at an 
unspecified location 
reprieved with lengthy jail terms the sharpeville six blacks 
sentenced to hang for complicity in a 1984 mob killing

in a march 1970 memo he asked haldeman would you please have 
the bordeaux years checked i know that 59 is an excellent year 
even with my unsophisticated taste but my recollection is that 66 
is one of the poor years the reason i ask is that we seem to have a 
huge stock of 66 bordeaux on hand and i wondered why 
memos from nixons aides revealed even the attractiveness of 
kissingers dinner companions did not escape the former presidents

the nations biggest banks raised their prime 
lending rates a half percentage point to 105 percent today the 
fourth increase this year 
the increase effective immediately pushes the base lending rate 
to its highest level since may 1985 when it was lowered a half 
percentage point to 10 percent 
chase manhattan was the first institution to announce the hike 
with several other major banks joining the move including citibank 
chemical bank manufacturers hanover trust co bankers trust and 
morgan guaranty trust co 
reaction in the financial markets was restrained at noon on wall 
street the dow jones industrial average was down 533 points to 
206935 while bond prices were mixed the dollar initially rose in 
foreign exchange trading but quickly retreated 
analysts had been expecting a prime hike due to the steady 
increase of interest rates in the credit markets in recent weeks 
it comes as no surpise given the rise in shortterm rates 
said william v sullivan economist for the investment firm dean 
witter reynolds inc 
sullivan said there also was building perception in the 
marketplace that the federal reserve might push rates even further 
by raising its discount rate or the interest charged to member 
banks for loans to support the dollar 
concerns about the growing federal budget and trade deficits have 
pushed the dollar sharply lower against most major currencies in 
recent weeks 
the prime rate reflects a banks costs of borrowing money and 
trails more subtle increases in other interest rates 
but the rate is watched closely because bankers use it as a basis 
for calculating loans to businesses and for determining many types 
of fixed and adjustablerate consumer loans including popular 
homeequity loans 
its clear that consumers will be absorbing higher borrowing 
costs in december or early next year said sullivan

a former fundraiser for lyndon h 
larouche jr testified today that he was instructed to tell people 
lending money to larouche organizations that they couldnt be repaid 
right away because larouche was fighting for the human race and in 
war there are casualties 
christian curtis of alexandria va told larouches conspiracy 
trial that the instruction came from larouche fundraising chief 
william wertz one of six larouche associates on trial with the 
political maverick in us district court here 
the defendants are accused of devising a scheme to avoid 
repayment of loans made to larouche organizations larouche alone is 
accused of defrauding the internal revenue service by failing to 
declare personal services paid for by his organizations as income 
curtis said he spoke to wertz about the failure to repay loans 
after a retired school teacher complained to him that she lived off 
her savings and needed her money back 
curtis said wertz told him he didnt want to hear complaints 
about loan repayments 
were in the midst of a war fighting for the human race were 
at war in war there are casualties you have to tell your contacts 
that 
did you tell them this asked assistant us attorney john 
markham 
no sir curtis replied we didnt tell them there would be 
casualties 
curtis was the third former employee of the threetime 
presidential candidate to paint an unflattering picture of larouche 
curtis who sought contributions in telephone solicitations told 
jurors that he and other larouche staffers were instructed to find 
ways to get the money and to accept no stories of financial 
hardship 
the minute you listen to their excuses youre dead curtis 
said he was told by superiors in the larouche organization 
larouche and his codefendants are charged with conspiracy to 
commit mail fraud and mail fraud in an alleged scheme to avoid 
paying back more than 30 million in loans to larouche 
organizations the mail fraud counts result from promissory notes 
sent to lenders through the mail 
larouche alone is charged with conspiring to defraud the internal 
revenue service by failing to declare as income the personal and 
household services he received from his organizations larouche has 
not filed an income tax return since 1979 according to the 
indictment 
the defendants contend that they had planned to pay back the 
loans but had to use the money to defend themselves against 
harassment from the federal government and the news media 
larouche also says hes innocent of the tax count because he has 
not earned any taxable income since 1979 
during the first three days of testimony last week prosecutors 
called witnesses who said they were defrauded by larouche staffers 
who did not keep promises to repay their loans then the prosecution 
called former larouche employees including a former security aide 
who described his onetime boss as paranoid and as a man who lied to 
his staff 
however one prosecution witness franklin harrison bell still 
works for larouche he testified there was an attempt to pay back 
those who lent money to larouches political campaigns but funds 
were scarce 
prosecutors introduced into evidence an internal memo by bell 
which made derogatory remarks about the contributors 
conviction for larouche could bring a maximum prison term of 65 
years and fines of 325 million 
his six codefendants would face lesser sentences if convicted 
on trial with larouche are his fundraising chief william wertz 
legal adviser edward spannaus and fundraisers michael billington

the supreme court on monday refused to disturb 
the current system for giving pay raises to members of congress a 
system that produced a 12000 salary hike last year 
the justices rejected arguments that the process gives too much 
power to the president to determine salary levels the court also 
without comment declined to use the case to determine what power 
members of congress have to challenge the constitutionality of 
federal laws 
sen gordon humphrey rnh and five republican house members 
challenged the payraise system after congressional salaries were 
raised 12000 last year to 89500 
the payraise system which was established by a 1967 law also 
controls salary increases for federal judges and highranking 
executive branch officials but the challengers to the law did not 
attack those provisions 
the us circuit court of appeals in washington upheld the 
payraise system last may 31 ruling it is constitutional because it 
allows congress to override salary increases granted by the 
president the supreme court left that ruling intact monday 
in other action the court 
heard arguments about the rights of unwed fathers whose children 
are put up for adoption by their mothers 
refused for now to let a jewish organization display a menorah 
symbolizing the hanukkah holiday on the steps of a pittsburgh 
government building next month the court is reviewing the 
constitutionality of the display 
agreed to use a case involving a small pennsylvania and ohio 
railroad to resolve an important railroad industry dispute affecting 
the ability of railroads to sell off their lines and reduce their 
work forces 
for the second time this month refused to grant husbands legal 
power to prevent their wives from having an abortion the court 
rejected an appeal by a michigan man who sought unsuccessfully last 
summer to stop his thenestranged wife from ending her pregnancy 
allowed prosecutors investigating labor union corruption in new 
york to use subpoenaed membership lists obtained from four 
carpenters union locals 
prior to 1967 congress had set its own salary scale but the 
lawmakers seeking to share responsibility for giving themselves pay 
raises passed the federal salary act in 1967 
the act calls for a study commission to be convened every four 
years with members appointed by all three branches of government 
the commission sumbits recommendations to the president who in turn 
proposes a pay plan to congress 
the presidents recommendations become effective unless congress 
acts within 30 days to disapprove them 
the law was amended in 1985 to require action by both houses to 
override the presidents recommendations the original law permitted 
either house to veto a pay hike but the socalled legislative veto 
was declared unconstitutional by the supreme court in 1983 
in its ruling in may the appeals court said the elimination of 
the legislative veto causes marginally increased practical 
difficulty for congress to override a presidential recommendation 
but the appeals court said congress still is afforded the 
opportunity explicitly to reject or modify any or all of the 
presidents recommendations before they go into effect 
the appeals court also rejected the challenge to the payhike 
statute on grounds the federal courts should not rule in disputes in 
which congress has the power to remedy the problem itself 
the appeals court also rejected an argument that delegating a 
role to the president in setting congressional salaries violates the 
constitutional separation of powers among the three branches of 
government 
challenging the law along with humphrey were reps robert dornan 
rcalif bob smith rnh beau boulter rtexas jack davis 
rill and clyde holloway rla 
they were joined by consumer advocate ralph nader and the 
national taxpayers union 
the reagan administration urged the supreme court to uphold the 
payraise system

the reagan administration while reaffirming 
its judgment that yasser arafat is an accessory to acts of 
terrorism today said it would not oppose the united nations 
shifting its debate on the palestinian issue to geneva 
even so state department spokesman charles e redman said the 
shift was unnecessary since there were other spokesmen for the 
palestine liberation organization in new york who could speak on the 
subject apart from chairman arafat 
we do not oppose the general assembly considering the 
palestinian question redman said its an important matter 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said that if the 
un session is moved to geneva we would participate 
arafat was denied a visa on saturday by secretary of state george 
p shultz because the secretary said arafat knows of condones 
and lends support to acts of terrorism 
on sunday president reagan said he agreed very much with the 
decision 
despite criticism from arafat and a number of arab leaders 
redman said today the decision was firm and final he said 
denial of the visa was based on the plos record the palestinian 
issue and middle east peace are separate issues redman said 
probably no other country in the world has worked as hard at 
the peace process as the united states has redman told the state 
departments daily news briefing 
he rejected the argument of arab and other critics that the 
decision was in conflict with us arrangements with the united 
nations redman said the united states reserved the right to protect 
its national security even while making arrangements in 1947 to have 
the un headquarters in new york 
at the white house fitzwater said the united states intended no 
affront to the united nations 
we were making no kind of statement about the united nations 
but about yasser arafat and terrorism reagans spokesman said 
fitzwater took questions on the us policy on the plo shortly 
after arafat told reporters in baghdad iraq that he thought the 
reagan administration had violated international law by refusing to 
grant him permission to visit the un general assembly and to 
address that body early next month 
the us dcision has been assailed by arab groups but all three 
democrats seeking the top party leadership post in the senate 
offered their support a spokesman for presidentelect george bush 
said bush had not been consulted in advance of the weekend state 
department announcement 
fitzwater said today that i dont think many americans are 
having much trouble understanding this decision 
boarding air force one as he headed back to washington after a 
sixday vacation at his california mountaintop ranch reagan 
stressed that the decision on whether to admit arafat was in the 
province of the secretary of state under us law 
in rejecting arafats request saturday shultz said he could not 
waive a legal provision that rules ineligible for a visa any person 
considered by the united states to be a threat to its security 
no participant in a peace process can wave the flag of justice 
in one hand and brandish the weapons of terrorism in the other 
the state department said in a weekend statement 
arafat last addressed the united nations in 1974 
asked sunday whether the united states was sending sufficient 
constructive messages about the middle east peace process given the 
plos recent moderate statements reagan replied i think the 
other would have sent a wrong signal that were patsies 
we are available and we have been ready to negotiate when the 
conditions are right at any and all times he said were the 
ones with the peace plan 
reagan did not cite any specific acts of terrorism attributed to 
arafats plo in recent weeks or months although he did say that i 
think the record shows the things the law is supposed to be 
protecting against are still going on in spite of the recent 
statements by the plo along more moderate lines 
asked what he meant by that the president said well the 
approval and use of terrorism and that sort of thing 
meeting in algiers recently the palestine national council the 
parliamentary arm of arafats organization endorsed resolutions 
implicitly recognizing israels right to exist and renouncing 
terrorism the administration said it found the statements 
promising but too vague 
when asked pointblank whether he believed the plo still was 
behind terrorism reagan said i think there is enough to justify 
not granting a waiver 
the state department said the us government had convincing 
evidence that the plo continues to engage in terrorism and cited 
the presence at the algiers meeting of an executive committee member 
convicted in connection with the hijacking of a twa jetliner and the 
murder of us citizen leon klinghoffer in 1985 
sens j bennett johnston of louisiana daniel k inouye of 
hawaii and george mitchell of maine all guests on sundays meet 
the press program on nbctv said they agreed that arafat should 
be denied permission to enter the united states 
the united states should indicate to one and all that we stand 
against terrorism and i think this was a very dramatic way of doing 
it said inouye who will be vying with johnston and mitchell for 
the post of senate majority leader in an election later this week 
said johnston the plo has members who are engaged actively 
in terrorism and as long as that organization does i dont think 
they should be allowed to speak at the un

the un general assembly will move swiftly 
to provide a forum for plo chairman yasser arafat who has been 
denied a us visa to address the body the assemblys president 
said today 
arafat in his first public comments since the us denial 
saturday called the us move a sheer violation of the 
international law and the un charter and claimed washington was 
ignoring international backing for the newly proclaimed state of 
palestine 
why are they afraid that i speak to world public opinion and 
explain the new palestinian decisions asked arafat he spoke to 
reporters in iraq 
foreign minister dante caputo of argentina president of the 
general assembly said today in a written statement that the united 
states is under the obligation to grant the visa sought by 
arafat 
as soon as we receive a special request from the arab group we 
shall proceed in the best possible manner to ensure that chairman 
arafat is able to address the general assembly he said 
the 159member general assembly was expected today or tuesday to 
overwhelmingly support a request from the arab nations to convene a 
special assembly in geneva to hear arafat the arab nations were to 
meet today to formulate their request 
the special session which would be unprecedented for the united 
nations would be held either later this month or in january 
also today the un committee on relations with the host country 
was to meet to consider the us decision which un officials call 
a violation of the 1947 usun headquarters agreement 
under the agreement the united states agrees not to impede with 
the transit or work of un diplomats or guests on un business 
the state department denied a visa to the arafat on saturday 
saying the palestine liberation organization chairman knows of 
condones and lends support to terrorist attacks 
president reagan lauded the decision saying i think the other 
way would have sent out the wrong signal that we are patsies 
reaction from other nations was largely negative 
speaking today on cbs this morning a member of the plo 
delegation at the united nations called the us charges of 
terrorism nonsense 
it is not serious because he secretary of state george 
shultz cannot substantiate his allegations said the plo 
official hassan rahman 
a un statement said that denying arafat a forum would be 
unfortunate at a time when in the view of the secretarygeneral 
the recent meeting of the palestine national council in algiers 
provides fresh opportunities for progress towards peace in the 
middle east 
the palestine national council the plo parliamentinexile 
proclaimed an independent palestinian state during its meeting in 
algiers on nov 15 more than 30 countries most of them arab have 
formally recognized the state 
the palestine homeland proclamation implicitly recognized israel 
by endorsing a un resolution that guarantees all middle east 
states the right to exist in peace it promised to restrict 
guerrilla activity 
the arab leagues un ambassador clovis maksoud said sunday he 
has enough votes to reconvene the general assembly in special 
session in geneva so arafat can address the group 
the nonaligned group in the un has 101 of the 159 voting 
members in the general assembly the plo has nonvoting observer 
status 
earlier this year arab and developing nations considered moving 
the current session to geneva when a us attempt to close the plos 
un observer mission was working its way through us courts 
in march the general assembly voted 1482 to condemn the us 
attempt to evict the plo mission by attempting to enforce an 
antiterrorism law only israel joined the united states in voting 
against the resolution 
king hussein of jordan and egyptian president hosni mubarak have 
agreed to spearhead the effort to reconvene the general assembly 
elsewhere the official jordan news agency said sunday 
soviet bloc nations also are likely to side with the plo 
israeli leaders praised the decision but algeria china egypt 
france libya saudi arabia norway denmark the netherlands 
sweden and australia were among other nations that protested it 
italy summoned a us embassy official to explain the decision 
chinas official xinhua news agency today called the us move 
another unwise decision australia said it regretted the move

jim newlin says some men are shocked when 
they learn he is the president of the kentucky national organization 
for women but women tend to take it in stride because they dont 
keep score the way men do 
most men that i know either dont know how to handle it or i 
would say some are envious and confused some will just say 
oh hes president congratulations based strictly on the fact 
that its an office they still dont know what the heck it is 
newlin 56 was elected president in october he is the second 
man to serve as president of a state chapter of now joining lawyer 
john katz who heads what is called the 51st state chapter in 
washington dc 
newlin an administrative assistant for a large louisville firm 
joined now in 1985 
now has everything he said in a recent interview its 
peace and economic justice its civil rights for everybody women 
children gays lesbians all of the things i really just 
automatically believed in because thats the way i grew up its not 
like im a big hero or something its just the way i am 
newlin who is married and has two grown children grew up during 
the depression 
we werent rich by any means he said but when people came 
to his home his mother would feed them 
it wasnt just at christmas i remember mother taking our 
clothes and giving them to poor people i mean it wasnt a big 
deal you just did it there was never any hero about it it was 
just the people next door didnt have as much as you had and so you 
helped them out 
newlin got his start in the womens movement in the early 80s 
when fearing the world was just going to whiz right by me he 
decided to join an organization he jumped at the opportunity to 
work with a presbyterian church womens concerns group simply 
because it was the first organization he encountered 
newlin considers himself a feminist but said he wont speak for 
women 
i will speak on behalf of women the same as i would any other 
group who is struggling he said 
he said he was concerned that winning the presidency would make 
it appear he was trying to bully his way into a leadership position 
im not a flash in the pan and im not in here for self 
gain 
newlins now colleagues agree 
he goes out of his way not to even participate in a lot of 
discussions at our board meetings and things said stacey jarbeau 
president of the jefferson county chapter the largest in kentucky 
with over 330 members 
hes tried very hard to not let anyone think hes trying to 
come in and take over 
patricia ireland nows executive vice president said newlins 
presidency is perhaps a reflection of the maturing of the 
organization and of our movement that some women and the men who are 
members can look at this man and say he has a valuable skill and 
hes a strong feminist and we want to learn from him and want 
him to be our leader and we are not threatened by that

the right of nevada casinos to hire and fire 
casino workers at will something enjoyed since the industry was 
legalized more than 50 years ago is on trial in a suit brought by 
37 dealers and floormen axed by the las vegas hilton 
the casino workers swept out five years ago in a housecleaning 
sparked by a sharp drop in the casinos blackjack win percentage 
contend they were replaced by younger mostly female workers and 
are the victims of age and sex discrimination 
the hilton claims the firings are just part of life in the casino 
business a cashfed industry where a bad days win may get a dealer 
fired and where greed and suspicion often dictate personnel 
decisions 
historically the resort contends casino workers have accepted 
the implied tradeoff between job security in exchange for the cash 
tips they take home every day 
in return for the high compensation there is little job 
security argued hilton attorney raymond kelly changes of 
personnel are frequent in this industry 
casino workers such as dealers and floormen are nonunion other 
hotel workers such as kitchen help waiters and others in the 
service industry are generally members of the powerful culinary 
union 
the fired workers who the hilton says averaged 100 a day in 
tips in addition to 45 a day salary are asking a federal court 
for reinstatement back pay and damages that could run into the 
millions of dollars 
the case is being watched as a possible precedent in a state 
where the idea of wrongful termination is an evolving area of law 
with only a few recent supreme court decisions to go by 
we will show that they were fired based only on the date of 
hire said brian berman an attorney for the plaintiffs they 
didnt even try to make any individual determination at all 
out of the 37 fired workers all but five were over the age of 
40 said berman they were replaced by 24 females and only one 
of the replacements was over the age of 40 if they had been firing 
just at random there was a oneinfourmillion chance they would 
fire that many old people 
kelly however said the average age of the fired workers was 40 
while the replacements averaged 374 years of age 
the dealers and floormen working the day and swing shift 
blackjack pit were fired without notice when they arrived at work 
sept 2 1983 
almost all of them had good evaluations and some of them were 
legends in the industry said berman they were the best of them 
all 
the firings both sides acknowledge came after a period in which 
the casinos drop or percentage of money it wins fell to 1 
percent at the blackjack tables 
the las vegas average house percentage win in blackjack games is 
generally between 18 and 20 percent 
something drastic was occuring here kelly said were 
talking about thousands of dollars a day and millions of dollars 
over the long term 
the resort finally decided to clean house 
following the termination of the plaintiffs in this case the 
pc casino term for percentage returned to normal kelly said 
in opening arguments 
kelly acknowledged that the hotel never pinpointed any dealer 
cheating 
the dealers contend middle management was stealing money 
although they also cannot prove their charges 
losses of the magnitude they were having could not be explained 
by a dealer scam said berman were talking about wheelbarrows 
full of chips they would have had to be hauling out of there 
the trial which began last week is expected to continue for at 
least three months before us district judge roger foley

a government spokesman said monday the next 
round of talks on us bases in greece will take place in athens in 
middecember 
negotiators are trying to forge an agreement that would extend 
us control of four bases in greece beyond the dec 31 expiration 
date 
the base negotiations are very difficult and no one can exclude 
the possibility that they might be suspended at some stage said 
government spokesman sotiris kostopoulos 
the last round of negotiations ended earlier this month in 
washington 
talks broke off in september when greece announced the hellenikon 
base near athens would have to close after the current pact expires 
dec 31 
about 1400 american servicemen 200 civilian employees and 700 
greeks work at the base which was set up in the 1940s 
negotiations resumed oct 3 after secretary of state george 
shultz met foreign minister carolos papoulias who was on a visit to 
washington 
since the 1950s the united states has operated four military 
bases in greece two near athens and two on the southern island of 
crete in addition to hellenikon there is a navy communications 
base at nea makri near athens a navy installation at souda bay on 
the island of crete and an air force communications base at 
gournes also on crete 
as compensation the united states pays greece more than 430 
million a year in military credits

brown university has asked police to find 
out how a turnofthecentury chandelier that disappeared from the 
school sometime in the late 1970s has reappeared in the newly 
renovated providence public library 
the 175pound chandelier whose value is estimated at 15000 to 
20000 is the centerpiece of the librarys periodicals atrium 
which was opened to the public with much fanfare two weeks ago 
after the ceremony brown officials realized the chandelier was 
identical to one that had hung in alumnae hall from 1927 until it 
was taken down during restoration work about 10 years ago said 
university spokesman robert reichley 
someone took a photo from our archives and compared it 
reichley said there doesnt seem to be any doubt whether its one 
and the same 
joseph enright a providence dealer in light fixtures told the 
providence journal in a story published monday that he bought the 
fixture in 1985 from a brown maintenance man who said he would take 
the chandelier to the junkyard if enright did not want it 
enright later sold the chandelier to arthur groger a newport 
antiques dealer who rented it to trinity repertory theater in 
providence for a production of all the kings men the library 
purchased the chandelier from groger last year after a staffer saw 
it at the theater the newspaper said 
john kuprevich browns director of police and security said his 
department has asked city police to help investigate it is our 
belief that it was not authorized to be disposed of in any way 
shape or form he said 
reichley and howard e walker chairman of the librarys board of 
directors said it was too early to tell whether brown would attempt 
to recover the chandelier 
were working cooperatively and amicably in trying to solve 
this issue reichley said 
i think it looks splendid we certainly think its an ideal 
fixture for our location walker said

avraham rabby had high hopes that his 
impressive academic and linguistic credentials would qualify him for 
a career in diplomacy 
but the state department after showing interest in rabby for 
three years finally ruled against him 
diplomacy the state department believes is not a suitable 
profession for the blind 
i am absolutely outraged rabby said in a recent interview 
it is absolutely unconscionable that the rest of the government 
has shown itself to be able to employ blind people constructively 
the state department is still in the 19th century 
the state department had been accepting job applications from 
blind people for 10 years and rabby himself had passed five entrance 
examinations since 1985 he recently was scheduled to take another 
but the department ruled that the blind would not be permitted to 
take examinations in braille or use other outside help thus making 
it impossible for rabby or others with similar disabilities to meet 
the entrance requirements 
rabby who lives in new york city is a graduate of oxford 
university in england with degrees in spanish and french and has a 
masters degree in business administration from the university of 
chicago 
he was born in what is now israel 46 years ago and lived for 15 
years in england and six months each in france and spain he speaks 
with the elegantly phrased formulations of a man accustomed to 
intellectual pursuits he has his own consulting business helping 
disabled people find employment 
state department officials speaking only on condition they not 
be named said the policy of rejecting blind applicants after 
allowing them to take admission tests was not as cynical as it might 
seem 
they said blind applicants were routinely advised that permission 
for them to take admission tests did not mean that medical standards 
requiring visual acuity for all diplomats would be relaxed 
the state department view under the recent ruling is that all 
foreign service officers must be worldwide available and that a 
blind person cannot be expected to deal with the myriad demands 
diplomats face 
one official said the united states has facilities for helping 
the blind overcome their handicap but that most foreign countries 
lack such accommodations 
another said that much of diplomacy involves reading the body 
language of foreign envoys during diplomatic discussions such 
gestures as winks and nods form part of the overall message a 
diplomat must assimilate the official said 
rabby said the blind are quite capable of picking up nonverbal 
signals nervousness he said can be read by projection of 
voice as can a smile 
he said the blind are no less able than sighted people to read 
other peoples language be it silent or verbal 
but a department official said accepting a blind person for 
diplomatic service would be a terribly unfair thing to do to that 
individual he cited highrisk posts such as lebanon as 
particularly inappropriate for a sightless person 
perry shankle president of the american foreign service 
association the union of career diplomats agreed 
its dangerous out there shankle said emphasizing he was 
speaking for himself and not the association its one of the 
facts of life for the diplomatic service you have to be constantly 
on the alert 
he suggested that the state department could resolve the problem 
by admitting the blind not as career diplomats but as civil 
servants who generally do not receive overseas assignments 
kenneth jernigan executive director of the national federation 
of the blind has little patience with the arguments of state 
department officials 
everybody says its wonderful what blind people can do so long 
as they work somewhere else jernigan said from his office in 
baltimore 
he said dealing with reading material is the principal activity 
of diplomats and blind people are capable of handling mountains of 
paperwork beyond that he said the blind require no more 
secretarial help than sighted persons 
jernigan added that the federation was prepared to take the state 
department to court but he hoped that recourse could be avoided 
james gashel director of government affairs for the federation 
said federal law requires that all government and 
governmentassisted programs conduct their employment practices 
without discrimination on the basis of handicap the blind and other 
disabled persons he said must be provided with reasonable 
accommodation to help them overcome their handicap 
but he said the state department wants a general exemption from 
this law because of the unique circumstances under which diplomats 
must work 
he said the last time a blind person threatened court action 
against the state department on the basis of discrimination the 
agency decided on an out of court settlement worth 165000 to the 
complainant 
his account could not be confirmed by state department officials

records of william shakespeares shotgun 
wedding may be hidden beneath a disused church near 
stratforduponavon says an investigator who probed beneath the 
floor with radar and opticalfiber photography 
if you can find where he was married you might stumble across 
something else arthur marlow said monday 
marlow 69 is seeking permission from the redundant churches 
fund to open the vault beneath all saints church at billesley four 
miles west of stratford pictures taken through a fiberoptic probe 
inserted into the vault show several coffins and what appear to be 
two chests in the vault 
if they decide in my favor we can start work in the new 
year he said by telephone from his home in market harborough 
about 50 miles north of the bards town 
excavation wont prove or disprove the authorship of the plays a 
question which marlow considers settled in favor of william 
shakespeare of stratford 
what i want to know what thousands of people want to know 
they want to know about his background his life what did he do 
where did he live 
shakespeare married anne hathaway in 1582 when the playwright 
was 18 their first child susanna was baptized may 26 1583 a 
bond dated nov 28 1582 taken as security for the bishop to issue 
a marriage license is the principal surviving document of the 
marriage 
she was three months pregnant anne hathaway was at the time 
they married it was what you would call a shotgun wedding marlow 
said 
where the couple exchanged vows is a mystery and two other 
churches west of stratford are candidates temple grafton is listed 
beside the name of annam whateley intended bride of william 
shakespeare in the bishops register marlow believes this is a 
different william shakespeare some scholars think the brides name 
is just badly misspelled 
a 19th century tradition places the marriage at luddington which 
like temple grafton has no records surviving from shakespeares time 
annes pregnancy marlow said may account for the couples 
choice of a rural church instead of the notoriety of a wedding in 
stratford 
the hathaway family lived at shottery a hamlet just west of 
stratford that had no church billesley is one of three churches 
within a few miles to the west 
billesley marlow noted is just a halfmile from wilmcote the 
home of shakespeares mother 
susannas daughter elizabeth shakespeares only grandchild 
took her second husband in the church in billesley marlow suggests 
that her first marriage may have been there as well following what 
he believes is a family tradition started by the playwright 
its thought that shakespeare may have used the library at 
billesley hall now a tourist inn the owners have pledged about 
180 toward the cost of digging into the vault marlow said 
marlow a retired metallurgist is an old hand at opening tombs 
in 1969 he said he located the grave of mary fitton one of the 
women who may have been the mysterious dark lady of 
shakespeares sonnets

a drop in oil prices and higher costs for us 
farm products helped provide a 54 percent improvement in americas 
trade deficit from july through september the third consecutive 
quarterly decline this year the government reported monday 
the commerce department said the imbalance between what america 
imports and what it sells abroad narrowed to 2853 billion in the 
third quarter the best showing in 3 years 
the deficit had fallen by 146 percent in the first quarter and 
declined another 143 percent in the second quarter to a revised 
3015 billion through the first nine months of the year the 
deficit is running at an annual rate of 1252 billion compared 
with last years record 1603 billion deficit 
analysts predicted the deficit for all of 1988 should be at least 
20 percent lower than 1987 marking the first time since president 
reagan took office in 1981 that the trade deficit has shown 
improvement 
that gain has contributed significantly to the economys 
momentum providing almost half of total growth this year but many 
analysts believe the rapid trade improvement will slow in 1989 and 
as a result they are looking for a much more sluggish economy next 
year 
the trade deficit has definitely turned around but we ost of his 
career in government was tapped by 
presidentelect george bush monday to be his press secretary 
bush said he chose fitzwater who was his vice presidential press 
secretary from 1985 to 1987 because i think hes the best 
the spokesman has received high marks from many reporters 
covering the white house but there also have been complaints that 
he is too easygoing and too often skips his daily white house 
briefings for reporters 
fitzwater was philosophical about the criticism 
facing the white house press corps every day is no day at the 
beach he said 
as to how long he would remain he said i figure you do this 
job the way you run the quarter mile you run as long and hard as 
you can and as fast as you can and when you drop they bring in 
someone else 
he said the offer from bush which came in a telephone call to 
his office at 830 in the morning came as a surprise 
i was making plans to leave he said he said he planned to 
call his two children and tell them the news as soon as they got out 
of school 
fitzwaters selection marks the first time any incoming president 
has chosen as his permament press secretary the same individual who 
did the job for his predecessor president kennedys press 
secretary pierre salinger stayed on briefly after kennedys 
assassination 25 years ago but president lyndon b johnson soon 
replaced him with bill moyers 
fitzwater grew up on a farm in abilene kan 
as a high school student he planted tulips at the eisenhower 
library in abilene there was a huge picture of ike and jim 
hagerty eisenhowers press secretary he said in an interview 
last year even then i wondered what it would be like to have 
that job 
he landed it in february 1987 after larry speakes resigned 
speakes had taken over the duties from james brady who was 
seriously wounded in an attempt on the presidents life in march 
1981 
the job pays 77400 a year 
bush said he had asked fitzwater to remain as press secretary 
the title that normally goes with the position of presidential 
spokesman in the reagan administration that title had been reserved 
for brady 
asked if brady would have a role in the new administration 
fitzwater said bush had raised the question internally and that 
the vice president and his advisers have some ideas of things they 
would like him to do 
from 1981 until 1983 fitzwater was press spokesman at the 
treasury department 
earlier he served nine years as a spokesman at the environmental 
protection agency after working as a speechwriter for 
thentransportation secretary john volpe and at the appalachian 
regional commission 
he was a deputy white house press secretary from 1983 to 1985 
when he joined the vice presidents staff 
he was a correspondent and editor with a number of kansas 
newspapers before coming to washington 
fitzwater made no commitments as to how often bush would meet 
with reporters but said i knew him before to be an open person 
willing to deal with the press and i think he will be again

a federal judge monday dismissed as 
absurd a former state senators request for a reduction in his 
sevenyear sentence saying exfugitive david friedland has been 
toying with the legal system for too long 
friedland convicted of pension fund fraud contends he should 
have his sentence reducted to probation because he cooperated with 
the government putting his life in danger 
his attorney brian shaughnessy also argued that the sentence 
would have been reduced three years ago when a reduction first was 
requested if friedland had not been indicted a second time for 
fraud he said an assistant us attorney sabotaged chances of a 
reduction by telling the court of the second case 
friedland faces sentencing friday for his guilty plea on that 
charge both cases involve his bilking of the same teamsters fund 
new brunswickbased local 701 at different times 
friedland 51 feigned a drowning accident weeks before the 
original sentence reduction hearing in september 1985 and the return 
of the second fraud indictment when friedland failed to appear in 
court us district judge dickinson r debevoise dismissed the 
reduction motion but gave him a 30day grace period 
friedland was recaptured last december in the indian ocean nation 
of the maldives after a globetrotting year on the run 
frankly i find this an absurd position debevoise said of 
friedlands request for a sentence reduction 
debevoise said the absurd and irresponsible conduct of the 
feigned death and flight alone was enough to deny the motion he 
also cited the fact that while friedland was cooperating with the 
government starting in 1982 he was engaged in the second fraud 
mr friedland has been toying with the court system the 
justice system for so many years he said 
after his 1980 conviction for receiving payoffs to arrange loans 
from the pension fund friedland signed an agreement to cooperate 
with the us attorneys office in 1982 he subsequently provided 
information on corruption in hudson county 
his efforts helped convict former weehawkin mayor wally lindsley 
and did not go much beyond that 
i think in retropspect its very hard to say he rendered 
complete cooperation first assistant us attorney michael 
chertoff said after the hearing 
this guy was always figuring who he wanted to give up who he 
didnt want to give up said chertoff 
on friday friedland is to appear before us district judge john 
gerry in camden he faces a 20year sentence for his guilty plea 
which he entered in september after four days of trial 
in that case friedland was charged with heading a scheme to 
defraud 20 million from the teamsters pension fund

the 10 men who will become new senators in 
january gathered in the capitol monday for a hectic orientation tour 
that for democrats included lobbying by the three veterans who 
want their votes for majority leader 
its a special day youll never forget said senelect 
herbert kohl dwis but its also like going to college as a 
freshman 
the newly elected senators five republicans and five democrats 
were quickly embroiled in senate politics as they eyed coveted 
committee assignments prime office locations and other perquisites 
of life in the senate 
for trent lott it wasnt necessarily a step up in life the 
veteran congressman gave up his position as house republican whip to 
run for and win the senate seat vacated by the retiring john 
stennis 
you look at the house and the senate and there certainly are a 
lot of differences lott said like why it takes three months in 
the senate to move in 10 guys when in the house they move in 43 
people in 30 days 
the five freshmen democrats hadnt even had time to sit down for 
lunch before being lobbied by the three men who want their votes 
tuesday when the majority party elects its leaders 
kohl announced he would support sen george mitchell of maine for 
the job because hes a person im confortable with joe 
lieberman of connecticut said he hadnt made up his mind and called 
it the first major decision ill have to make as a senator 
i honestly dont know them very well lieberman said 
theyre all saying roughly the same thing it comes down to a 
decision in your gut 
mitchell 55 also picked up the endorsements of sens edward 
kennedy and john kerry of massachusetts and bob graham of florida 
over the weekend but sens daniel inouye 64 of hawaii and bennett 
johnston 56 of louisiana also have support and no one is predicting 
the outcome 
i havent the vaguest notion whos going to win said sen 
alan dixon dill there must be 75 of us if you add up the 
promised votes he said suggesting that some of the 55 democrats 
were playing multiple choice in the verbal straw balloting 
my experience my seniority should be in my favor inouye 
said in an interview sunday 
clearly my centrist approach is an advantage johnston said 
it would be a good message for the country it would be a good 
message for the democratic party 
most of the freshmen were more interested in lobbying for office 
space and committee assignments and in finding their way through 
the labyrinth of hallways corridors and subways that honeycomb the 
capitol 
senatorelect conrad burns a montana republican who unseated 
veteran democrat john melcher wasnt too concerned with seeking out 
plum offices and assignments under complicated senate rules and 
procedures he stands at the bottom of the seniority ladder 
everybodys worrying about numbers whether theyll be number 
97 98 or whatever said burns i said boys you cant get any 
lower than 100 
burns hadnt yet acquired the senate uniform of dark suit red 
tie and cufflinks the former farm radio broadcaster showed up in 
brown pants a sportcoat and western belt buckle and said he was 
busy getting your feet on the ground learning what you can do and 
what you cant do 
kohl said that despite the rounds of meetings receptions 
introductions tours and speeches its a very personal day a 
redletter day for me my father and mother were immigrants sixty 
five years ago they had nothing and now their son is a united 
states senator 
thats what i was thinking about as i listened to byrd and dole 
speak kohl said referring to democratic leader robert c byrd 
and republican leader bob dole 
i feel the sense of history said lieberman its not going 
to be an easy time to be a united states senator he said citing 
budget deficits taxes and environmental problems 
dixon an eightyear senate veteran was asked if he had any 
advice for the freshman class of 1989 
ill tell them to pray a lot he said with a grin

both sides have agreed to terms for a 
nationally televised debate wednesday night between solidarity 
leader lech walesa and the head of the official trade union 
alliance a solidarity spokesman said 
the debate between walesa and alfred miodowicz is to take place 
immediately after the main evening news show 
if it comes off as planned it would be the first time that 
walesa has ever been allowed to appear live on statecontrolled 
polish television to present his reasons for wanting the banned 
union made legal again 
janusz onyszkiewicz solidaritys national spokesman said he 
reached agreement monday on general terms for the meeting during a 
telephone conversation with miodowiczs representative jan bogutyn 
bogutyn and the television director marek tumanowicz were not 
immediately available for comment according to spokesmen at their 
offices 
earlier in the day miodowicz who is also a member of polands 
ruling polish united workers communist party politburo told a 
news conference that he was ready for the debate on trade union 
issues 
walesa also said he is ready to face miodowicz 
ive already bought tickets for the morning train to warsaw 
said walesa speaking by telephone from his home in gdansk 
onyszkiewicz said the solidarity side agreed to his federations 
proposals that the debate be broadcast live from warsaw that 
miodowicz be allowed to speak first that there will be no 
moderator and that miodowicz and walesa mutually decide how the 
tape of the broadcast would be used in the future 
according to onyszkiewicz the official union did not oppose a 
solidarity proposal that film director andrzej wajda be allowed to 
have a film crew inside the state tv studio and make a backup tape 
of the debate but said it would leave that decision to tv officials 
we would expect tv to agree onyszkiewicz said solidarity 
says it needs such a backup as a record in case state tv somehow 
manipulates the broadcast to walesas disadvantage 
walesas last appearance on polish tv was in 1983 when he was 
allowed to speak from the floor at the lenin shipyard in gdansk 
after a speech by thendeputy prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski 
rakowski who became polands prime minister in september 
answered walesa and walesa was cut off when he tried to reply 
miodowicz proposed the tv debate with walesa on nov 14 during an 
interview with the official communist party daily trybuna ludu 
miodowiczs federation says it represents 7 million polish 
workers the official unions were formed by the government in 1982 
to replace solidarity outlawed following the 1981 martiallaw 
crackdown 
solidarity has remained active despite the ban and argues that 
it should be relegalized alongside the official unions 
miodowicz maintains there should be only one union in one 
enterprise and says solidarity supporters should join his unions and 
attempt to influence them from within

plo chief yasser arafat said monday the 
united states violated international law by refusing him a visa to 
address the un general assembly in new york this week 
why are they afraid that i speak to world public opinion and 
explain the new palestinian decisions arafat said to reporters in 
baghdad where the palestine liberation organization has its 
military headquarters 
at a meeting nov 15 in algiers the palestine national council 
declared an independent palestinian state and implicitly recognized 
israel the council acts as the plo legislature 
arafat called the us rejection of his visa application a 
sheer violation of international law and a grave violation of 
the 1947 headquarters treaty between the united states and united 
nations 
he said the united states chose to ignore international approval 
of the new palestinian policy palestinian officials say 67 nations 
have declared support for an independent palestine 
only israel has welcomed a statement by secretary of state george 
p shultz denying the visa on grounds that arafat was an 
accessory to terrorism by plo elements 
an israeli foreign ministry official said maybe now part of 
the world will have to reexamine the situation and take another 
look at the record of the plo its quite a bloody record 
in his comments to journalists monday arafat said jordan was 
seeking to have the general assembly debate on the palestinian 
issue scheduled to begin thursday moved to geneva or vienna so the 
plo chairman could attend 
jordans official daily alshab said in an editorial this 
american decision against palestinians and arabs and many other 
countries in the world aims at suffocating the moderate and positive 
palestinian voice the voice of peace that everyone in the arab 
world is calling for 
arab criticism of the visa refusal was echoed by communist 
nations and by western allies of the united states which urged 
washington to reconsider president hosni mubarak of egypt a us 
ally who supports moving the debate also said he had asked shultz 
and president reagan to change the decision 
mubarak said he hoped the united states will respond because 
that will help to push the peace process in the region 
arafat called the palestine national council declarations which 
include renunciation of violence outside israel and israeli occupied 
territory the last chance for peace in the middle east 
us ally saudi arabia and other arab nations in the persian gulf 
region asked washington to revise a decision which does not 
harmonize with its principles of peace justice and harmony inthe 
world a saudi official said in a statement carried by the 
kingdoms official news agancy 
syria which has feuded with arafat for years accused the united 
states of favoritism toward israel and declared we all know 
the americans laud the strong and despise the weak 
saud osaimi kuwaiti minister for state for foreign affairs 
summoned us ambassador nathaniel howell to express kuwaits deep 
regret a government statement said howell was told the decision 
does not conform with the responsibilities of the united states 
and its role toward the world community in preserving world peace 
and stability 
in bahrain the foreign ministry expressed surprise and 
astonishment qatar said washington should revise its 
unjustified decision to prove its credibility in a serious quest 
for a just and lasting settlement 
sheik hamdan bin zayed foreign undersecretary of the united arab 
emirates said reconsidering the decision was a necessity to 
bolster the efforts exerted for establishing a just and lasting 
peace in the middle east 
north yemens parliamentary urged arab and islamic governments 
along with peaceloving countries to make a unified response to 
the us action 
it said denying a visa was no response to the positive steps 
that the palestinian leadership took and the sincere desire it 
demonstrated for a just peace

the government announced monday the inflation rate 
has risen to 26 percent in october despite an austerity program 
that began two months ago 
the new figure is the highest monthly inflation rate since the 
1950s and likely will continue rising through december the official 
state statistical bureau said 
in september government leaders began an austerity drive 
designed to curb inflation below 10 percent 
however the official xinhua news agency quoted the bureau as 
saying panic buying in august and september has almost ended and 
bank savings which went down sharply was returning to normal 
authorities have imposed rationing after reports of panic buying 
of textiles in shanghai and salt in 19 other areas 
the inflation statistics came as the state commission for 
restructuring the economy which has charted economic reforms and 
the state planning commission in charge of economic planning met 
on monday 
a television news broadcast said premier li peng and vice premier 
yao yilin who head the commissions respectively reported progress 
was being made but more work was needed to reign in the overheated 
economy 
the report did not say if the commissions were considering new 
measures to reduce inflation 
state statistical bureau spokesman mao youfeng told xinhua that 
chinas retail price index in october was 261 percent higher than 
in october 1987 the last time china released comparable figures it 
said june prices were up 19 percent over june 1987 
mao said prices in october were up 17 percent from jan 1 and the 
annual inflation rate is believed to be about 40 percent 
the official china news service has said that september retail 
prices in the southern commercial city of canton were up 44 percent 
from a year earlier and inflation in other cities also was above 
the national average 
china has not experienced such high inflation since the initial 
years after world war ii and the 1949 communist takeover although 
inflationary pressures existed the government kept prices 
artificially low and subsidized farmers and factories 
in recent years the government has raised some prices and 
decontrolled others in an effort to develop a marketstyle economy 
prices have been pushed up by growing industrial demand for limited 
raw materials fuel and transport services as well as by high 
consumer demand for household appliances 
in addition inflation was fueled by widespread hoarding and 
profiteering 
in an effort to curb demand the government in late september 
ordered a halt to thousands of construction projects nationwide and 
told government offices to cut spending 
however industrial output still grew more than 20 percent in 
october over the previous year indicating the policies have not yet 
been effective

the fbi tried to buy names of unemployed 
workers in the portland area last year in hopes of tracking down 
fugitives but oregon employment division officials rejected the 
request a newspaper reported monday 
fbi officials said the proposal was a routine technique for 
catching criminals but an employee approached at the divisions 
office in portlands skid row said she was concerned about violating 
the confidentiality of the agencys mostly impoverished clientele 
the salem statesmanjournal reported in a copyright story monday 
im all for helping the police and the fbi said patti 
sherman but on the other hand this is a homeless shelter where 
individuals come and want to feel safe i would have felt like a spy 
if i sold their names thats the most dishonest thing i personally 
could have done 
employment division director we hunter disclosed the fbis 
proposal after a division worker in springfield was fired last month 
for notifying law enforcement officials that a client was wanted on 
a probation violation charge in washington state 
karen hulsey a 12year veteran of the division has appealed her 
firing hunter said she violated the divisions privacy policy 
which he reemphasized after the fbis proposal was made last year 
in october 1987 fbi agents tried to obtain lists of unemployed 
people visiting the state office in portlands skid row that action 
was part of a national fbi effort to purchase names social security 
numbers and birth dates of clients and employees of private 
companies and government agencies said james dietz a special agent 
in the fbis portland office 
the state agency said the fbi wanted more than lists of clients 
if the names of fugitives appeared on the lists the fbi wanted 
division workers to contact the fugitives and tell them to visit the 
downtown office for job interviews according to state officials 
fbi agents would be waiting to arrest the job applicants 
hunter rejected the request on the advice of his staff and an 
assistant state attorney general who said it could violate state 
privacy laws and endanger division employees 
the fbi offered to pay 2 for the name of each client and 300 to 
400 for a name if it turned out to be that of a wanted felon 
division officials said 
hunter said he would be willing to release such information on a 
casebycase basis 
but they wanted more than just information he said this 
was a stinglike operation 
during the past 20 years the fbi has caught thousands of 
fugitives by feeding such information into a national computer 
system that checks the data against a list of about 25000 currently 
wanted criminals said charles mathews the assistant special agent 
in charge of the portland office

saying the us decision to bar plo leader 
yasser arafat from the country was firm and final the state 
department on monday gave its reluctant consent to moving the united 
nations debate on palestinian issues to geneva 
there the chairman of the palestine liberation organization could 
air his views despite a us finding that he was an accessory to 
acts of terrorism against americans and did not qualify for a visa 
to enter the united states 
its unnecessary department spokesman charles e redman said 
of the attempt by arab diplomats to move part of this years general 
assembly session to geneva 
he said other plo officials present in new york could speak for 
arafats group and besides a shift to geneva would be costly 
but redman acknowledged if the united nations decided to move 
the debate out of the country the same factors would not be 
applied in the same way 
arafat would not require us permission in order to speak and 
the judgment of l paul bremer director of the departments office 
to counter terrorism that the palestine national council has not 
renounced terrorism would not be applicable 
while we do not favor such a move we do not oppose it redman 
said he called discussion of a shift at this point only 
hypothetical 
the decision to bar arafat was made saturday by secretary of 
state george p shultz 
turning down an appeal from the united nations for favorable 
consideration he concluded that arafat knows of condones and 
lends support to terrorist acts against americans by units of 
fatah the dominant group in the plo headed by arafat he is 
therefore an accessory to such terrorism shultz said 
the rebuff provoked criticism from arafat and several western 
european and arab governments as well as allegations the united 
states was not living up to the terms of its 1947 agreement to be 
the host for the un headquarters 
redman said however this is a question of terrorism security 
and the security of american citizens 
the spokesman said the united states conditioned its acceptance 
of the 1947 agreement on the right to bar entry of aliens in order 
to safeguard its own security 
redman sought meanwhile to separate the issue of a visa for 
arafat from problems in the middle east he said probably no other 
country in the world has worked as hard at the peace process as the 
united states has 
shultz made four trips to the area this year in an unsuccessful 
effort to promote negotiations between israel and a joint delegation 
of jordanian and palestinian arabs 
we do not oppose the general assembly considering the 
palestinian question redman said its an important matter 
he said us diploamts would participate in any un debate 
meanwhile presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said the 
united states intended no affront to the united nations by denying 
arafats request for a visa 
briefing reporters at the white house a day after president 
reagan said that he agreed very much with shultzs decision 
fitzwater said we were making no kind of statement about the 
united nations but about yasser arafat and terrorism 
fitzwater took questions on the plo issue shortly after arafat 
told reporters in baghdad iraq that the administration had 
violated international law 
i dont think many americans are having much trouble 
understanding this decision the spokesman said 
sheila tait spokeswoman for presidentelect george bush said 
bush was informed of the decision and stands behind it as a 
member of the administration bush did not respond to a shouted 
question on the matter during a white house appearance monday 
on sunday stephen hart a spokesman for bush said he had not 
been consulted in advance of shultzs announcement

snows this winter could provide welcome relief 
to droughtplagued areas of the midwest northwest and appalachia 
the national weather service projected monday 
the southeast and gulf coast meanwhile appear likely to bask in 
warmer than normal weather for the next three months according to 
the longrange forecast for december through february 
this particular season we think is more likely to be warm 
than cold more likely to be wet than dry said dr donald l 
gilman the agencys chief longrange forecaster 
large areas of the middle of the country including the northern 
plains remain a major question mark however with the forecast too 
close to call in those regions gilman said 
a major factor in the prediction is a pattern of cooler than 
normal ocean temperatures in the pacific ocean gilman said unlike 
years when this area has been warm the cooler conditions tend to 
steer weather systems from the pacific across mexico and into the 
southeastern states pumping warm air into that region 
but gilman pointed out that conditions in the northern pacific 
and gulf of alaska are unsettled and changes there could upset the 
outlook for california and the northwest 
this is a zone of great doubt he said 
the best news is likely that there is little severe cold in the 
forecast gilman said 
but asked if that means that the warmer than normal conditions 
of the past summer were continuing he said no the above normal 
winter temperature forecast is not a continuation of that pattern 
nor is it a result of overall climate warming he said 
for some droughtaffected regions the outlook for a wet winter is 
good news he said the midwest outlook is favorable for helping 
recharge the soil 
the strongest chance for wetter than normal weather is in 
michigan indiana and ohio gilman forecast 
also anticipating a wet winter should be washington oregon 
idaho western montana wisconsin michigan illinois kentucky new 
york pennsylvania west virginia western north carolina western 
virginia and eastern tennessee 
dry conditions are expected from southern california eastward 
through arizona new mexico texas louisiana florida and the 
southern portions of mississippi alabama and georgia 
the outlook is too close to call in other areas including the 
northern great plains states which have also suffered from drought 
this year but gilman noted in that region the heaviest 
precipitation is usually in spring rather than winter so the 
farming outlook could still be good for next year 
turning to temperatures the only region with a below normal 
outlook is minnesota wisconsin northern iowa and eastern north and 
south dakota 
warmer than normal conditions are expected in utah arizona new 
mexico most of texas louisiana arkansas kentucky west virginia 
virginia maryland delaware and all states to the south and east of 
those 
the odds of warmer than usual weather increase to the south and 
east the forecast notes

the nicaraguan rebel commander monday 
said the sandinista government has ended an eightmonth ceasefire 
by staging offensive military operations in eastern and northern 
nicaragua 
we have alerted our combatants that the sandinistas are 
declaring war said enrique bermudez in a broadcast over the 
rebels clandestine radio liberacion 
the director of the rebels nicaraguan resistance umbrella 
organization also said the sandinistas received new shipments of 
soviet military aid since august these included large numbers of 
groundbased ac2 and ac3 missiles and mi17 helicopters he said 
bermudez accused the government of seeking a military advantage 
over the rebels who have gone without us military assistance 
since congress voted to cut off lethal aid in february 
since 1981 the reagan administration has supported the rebels 
known as contras in their bid to overthrow the leftist government 
in march the sandinistas and contras signed a ceasefire 
agreement in the southern town of sapoa talks on a permanent truce 
broke down in september and each side accuses the other of 
ceasefire violations 
the sandinistas are saying that the sapoa accords ended 
definitively and that they are not going to continue negotiations 
said bermudez he said the sandinista army was conducting offensives 
against contra forces in the northern province of matagalpa and 
eastern chontales province 
we are going to continue defending ourselves in cases when 
were attacked he said 
defense minister gen humberto ortega said the army was 
fulfilling the orders of president daniel ortega regarding the 
end to offensive military operations but we must be ready to reject 
with force each criminal action that the contras make he was 
quoted monday in the progovernment newspaper el nuevo diario 
a government official sunday said four contras were killed in a 
clash with government troops east of managua the capital 
fernando caldera interior ministry representative in chontales 
also said 12 soldiers and defense ministry personnel and eight 
civilians have been killed in rebel ambushes over the past two 
months 
another 22 people including 10 rebels and 12 civilian militia 
died wednesday when guerrillas battled local defense forces in the 
remote hamlet of el guabo 137 miles east of managua the government

presidentelect george bush announced monday 
that marlin fitzwater president reagans spokesman for the past two 
years would keep his job in an example of continuity in the best 
sense 
bush also sought to make peace with a former rival senate 
minority leader bob dole inviting the kansas republican to a 
private lunch and declaring the focus is properly on looking to 
the future 
dole who lost the gop presidential nomination to bush agreed to 
set any past animosities aside the election is over and we both 
have obligations and certainly mine is to help him become a great 
president and i intend to do that he said 
the naming of fitzwater represented yet another bush selection 
from the ranks of veterans of previous administrations asked when 
the new faces he has promised would begin to appear bush said 
stay tuned for the changes well be getting to them soon 
transition sources said they expect the naming of former sen 
john tower as defense secretary and texas oilman robert mosbacher as 
commerce secretary later this week however the vice president gave 
no clue as to when hed name additional cabinet choices 
he showed up unexpectedly at fitzwaters usual 1130 am 
briefing in the white house to announce his decision to retain the 
46yearold career government spokesman who had been his press 
secretary in 198587 
i think hes the best bush said he represents the old and 
the new he represents the reagan administration and he also 
represents the bush administration this is continuity in the 
best sense 
fitzwater with his own brand of selfdeprecating humor called 
the offer a wonderful opportunity but added i think i 
represent the old and the older 
the transition should be a smooth one fitzwater joked i 
have a lot of ideas for my successor but i havent had a chance to 
think about them yet 
fitzwater said the new president would have news conferences as 
regular as possible 
its a new administration a new president im sure well have 
new ways of dealing with the press im sure therell be all kinds 
of interviews and press conferences and meetings he added 
fitzwater has had the title assistant to the president for press 
relations since febuary 1987 when he succeeded larry speakes 
although bush said that fitzwater would be retained as press 
secretary that title is actually still held by james brady who 
was wounded in the march 1981 assassination attempt on the president 
when asked whether brady would have a role in the new 
administration fitzwater said i know the vice president is very 
interested in jim and concerned about his well being and that bush 
and his advisers have some ideas of things they would like him to 
do 
fitzwater said sheila tate would remain bushs press secretary 
through the transition and he would take over on jan 20 ms tate 
has said she plans to leave government 
fitzwater said bush telephoned him early monday made the offer 
and i quickly accepted 
at lunch bush and dole dined alone for awhile then were joined 
by bushs choice for budget director richard g darman for a 
discussion of budget issues 
bush said he hoped to work with dole as well as with democratic 
leaders in forging a compromise to ease the governments budget 
deficit were going to address this budget deficit early on he 
said 
dole who said during the primary campaign that bush should 
stop lying about my record said monday weve both been 
through some pretty rough campaigns 
now he said the election is over i vowed to the 
presidentelect wed work together 
bush told reporters he had gotten some very good ideas from 
dole on dealings with congress 
neither of us is naive therell probably be some times when we 
differ with the majority party up there he said but he added 
that he was confident he could work as president with gop leaders in 
both senate and house and reach out to the democrats as well 
dole said the two just talked generally about timing but that 
as soon as bush wanted to get into specifics ill be happy to

nasa set an invisible countdown clock 
in motion monday for thursdays launch of space shuttle atlantis 
with five military men who reportedly will deploy the 500 million 
lacrosse satellite to spy on the soviet union 
nasa and the pentagon say the flight and its cargo are 
topsecret but reports have circulated widely about the satellite 
and even the soviet union has discussed the mission through its news 
agency tass 
the weather could be a problem for launch day a preliminary 
forecast for thursday called for overcast sky brisk winds and 
isolated rainshowers unfavorable conditions that would prevent 
nasa from giving the goahead for liftoff 
the astronauts flew here monday afternoon from their training 
base in houston and their commander navy cmdr robert l gibson 
told reporters were ready to go the crew is excited about the 
mission and were anxious to be under way he said he hoped for 
good weather on thursday 
the crew members have been instructed not to discuss their 
mission publicly and when a reporter shouted a question about the 
flight gibson smiled and replied good to see you 
the pilot is air force lt col guy s gardner and the mission 
specialists are col richard m mullane and lt col jerry l ross 
of the air force and navy cmdr william m shepherd 
the countdown started shortly after midnight but because the 
mission is classified countdown displays normally monitored by the 
news media were blank 
nasa and the defense department made periodic reports that all 
was well but said they wanted to keep the precise progress of the 
count secret to hide the exact time of launch no information has 
been made public about the number or length of planned holds 
when the clock would normally be stopped 
officials have said atlantis will lift off sometime between 632 
am and 932 am thursday reliable sources have said the launch 
will occur about 7 am if weather and other conditions are adequate 
defense department officials contend the secrecy makes it more 
difficult for soviet satellites and spy ships operating off cape 
canaveral to monitor the flight and learn its purpose 
critics argue that such secrecy is unnecessary because the 
soviets with their intelligence capabilities already know a great 
deal about the mission 
in fact the official soviet news agency tass said sunday the 
main task of the secret mission is to put into nearearth orbit a 
new generation reconnaissance satellite codenamed lacrosse the 
satellite will conduct surveillance of the territory of the soviet 
union with the help of updated radar the pentagon plans to deploy 
in the next few years four other similar spy satellites which will 
play the role of an eye for the new strategic bomber b2 known as 
stealth 
us critics also say that once atlantis satellite is in its own 
orbit the soviets will be able to track it precisely and know what 
it is doing 
knowledgeable sources report the satellite will gather extremely 
sharp radar images of eastern europe and soviet military targets as 
it follows a course that covers 80 percent of the soviet union a 
major assignment will be to help american intelligence officials 
verify russian compliance with arms control treaties 
the sources say the satellite is huge that it weighs more than 
30000 pounds and once deployed it will extend two solar panels to 
a span of 150 feet they say its radar will be able to penetrate 
clouds and they estimate the cost at more than 500 million 
the flight will be the 27th for the shuttle program the third 
dedicated totally to the defense department and the second since the 
challenger explosion that killed seven crew members in january 1986 
the secrecy about atlantis launch contrasts sharply with the 
fanfare that surrounded last septembers flight of discovery on the 
first postchallenger mission

an attorney plans to argue wednesday for a new 
trial for randall dale adams whose guilt in the killing of a 
policeman was questioned by the documentary film the thin blue 
line 
adams was convicted nine years ago of the 1976 murder of dallas 
officer robert wood and sentenced to death for the slaying his 
sentence later was commuted to life in prison 
the thin blue line suggests that police and prosecutors 
virtually framed adams by suppressing evidence of his innocence and 
using five questionable witnesses 
adams attorney randy schaffer contends adams did not receive a 
fair trial largely because prosecutors did not turn over documents 
favorable to the defense as required by the us supreme court 
schaffer also said he plans to use evidence generated in the 
making of the film at the hearing 
schaffer said he will question the credibility of five witnesses 
who testified against adams including key witness david ray harris 
harris originally testifed that adams shot wood while harris and 
adams were riding together in a stolen car 
but harris now claims that adams was not even in the car when the 
fatal shots were fired 
david harris has essentially admitted in the past month that he 
committed the capital murder of dallas police officer robert wood 
schaffer wrote in his application for a writ of habeas corpus which 
would bring the case to court again adams has been incarcerated 
for almost 12 years for an offense which he did not commit 
schaffer is asking state district judge larry baraka to recommend 
a new trial and adams release pending the trial the judge will 
make a recommendation to the texas court of criminal appeals

the defense department is about to launch one 
of the most extensive surveys ever undertaken to spotlight sexual 
harassment in the workplace 
the written survey will be distributed in december to more than 
34000 men and women on active duty in the armed forces plus 4000 
in the coast guard an agency of the transportation department it 
will ask if they have ever been the victims of uninvited unwanted 
sexual attention 
by contrast the merit systems protection board which conducted 
a similar survey among civilian government workers last year polled 
a sample of about 13000 fulltime federal workers and received 
responses from 8500 
the military survey was ordered last february by defense 
secretary frank c carlucci in response to a recommendation from a 
special task force the panel concluded that sexual harassment was a 
serious problem for women in the armed forces and that the services 
should open additional jobs to females 
maj david super a pentagon spokesman said the confidential 
survey will be distributed to 8900 enlisted personnel and officers 
in the army 8900 in the air force 8600 in the navy 7700 in the 
marine corps and 4000 in the coast guard 
approximately 21000 men and 17000 women are slated to receive 
the questionnaires 
researchers hope some preliminary results will be available by 
april but a final report is not expected before june super said 
the spokesman said the questions in the fourpart survey are 
designed to determine whether sexual harassment has been a problem 
in the past and how serious a problem it is today service members 
who have been harassed within the previous 12 months will be asked 
to provide details of the experience 
respondents will be asked to offer a frank appraisal of how their 
work productivity was affected by any incident of sexual harassment 
whether they reported the alleged harassment and requested any type 
of investigation and in what region of the country or area of the 
world the incident occurred 
completion of the survey will be voluntary but the response rate 
is expected to be high because the pentagon will ask military 
commanders around the world to encourage participation 
the survey by the merit systems protection board which was 
released in july concluded that sexual harassment in the civilian 
government world was pervasive costly and systemic 
the board said 42 percent of women and 14 percent of men who 
responded to its survey of federal employees said they experienced 
some form of sexual harassment from may 1985 to may 1987 that 
figure was virtually identical to findings in the boards 1980 
survey 
super said the 35000 pentagon survey should provide basic 
information to defense officials about how serious the problem of 
sexual harassment is inside the military the effectiveness of 
existing regulations and what changes might be helpful

a graduate student reading 20yearold medical 
journals discovered plagiarized passages that have resulted in the 
resignation from harvard medical school of one of the nations top 
psychiatrists a harvard official said monday 
dr shervert frazier a former head of the national institute of 
mental health resigned last week as a harvard professor and 
director of mclean hospital a psychiatric hospital affiliated with 
the university 
the resignation followed an investigation by the medical schools 
faculty conduct committee which concluded that plagiarism occurred 
in four papers written by frazier and published between 1966 and 
1975 according to a letter from dean daniel c tosteson to the 
medical school faculty 
the letter dated nov 23 was made public by the university 
monday both frazier and tosteson were out of town and unavailable 
for comment monday said harvard spokesman peter costa 
dr s james adelstein dean of academic programs at the medical 
school said frazier 67 did not dispute the committees findings 
but said the plagiarism resulted from lax methods not deceptive 
intent 
he said that when he read a paper he would copy parts of it 
out adelstein said later he put the cards together and was 
not always as careful as he should have been the dean said 
if you look at these papers what you see is that there are 
paragraphs within them that are more or less verbatim from some 
other places adelstein said 
the articles were brought to the attention of school officials in 
august by paul scatena a 28yearold graduate student at the 
university of rochester who was researching medical literature on 
pain 
scatena said monday that he was pleased by the job harvard did 
checking out his complaints he said he sent copies of the articles 
to harvard using colorcoded highlighting to note the 
similarities 
im very glad that harvard seems to be in the forefront of 
tackling some of these ethical issues that are plaguing science 
these days scatena said 
three of the four papers are about phantom pain the burning 
sensation that people sometimes feel from a limb that has been 
amputated the fourth is on psychiatric emergency management 
the plagiarized portions were taken from earlier articles in 
scientific american clinical neurosurgery and other publications 
adelstein said the four papers appeared in medical review 
journals or textbooks including the american handbook of psychiatry 
frazier was a professor of psychiatry at harvard from 1972 until 
1984 when he left to become director of the national institute of 
mental health in rockville md he held that post for two years 
before returning to harvard to head mclean one of the nations 
leading psychiatric hospitals 
he has also worked at the mayo clinic presbyterian hospital in 
new york and baylor university among other institutions he is a 
former commissioner of mental health and mental retardation in texas 
and former chairman of the american psychiatric associations joint 
commission on public affairs 
the university takes very seriously any charges of plagiarism 
because thats what were about the search for truth and 
knowledge costa said 
in his letter to the faculty tosteson wrote that the committee 
could not determine whether any other writing by frazier had been 
plagiarized

police charged five people with 
illegal assembly after what the military said was an attempt by 
supporters of ferdinand marcos to stage a mass uprising like the one 
that toppled their exiled leader 
president corazon aquino brushed aside saturdays events in 
which troops turned back bus and jeep convoys carrying about 1000 
civilians into the city with leaflets promising a constitutional 
military government 
military officials said the convoy was organized by supporters of 
marcos who has lived in hawaii since he was ousted in a 1986 
popular uprising 
col manuel oxales deputy chief of the national capital region 
defense command said convoy leaders planned to surround military 
garrisons in the capital much like the february 1986 uprising that 
propelled mrs aquino to power 
but he said there was no evidence any soldiers had joined the 
convoys made up mostly of civilians from agricultural areas near 
manila 
they were just making noises and they wanted to be noticed 
mrs aquino said i guess people will keep on trying to undermine 
the government but i think they should realize now that the people 
are against them and they will not support them in something like 
this 
officials said most of those in the convoy were allowed to return 
home after police questioning but five people were charged on 
monday with illegal assembly police were looking for the alleged 
ringleader jose ocampo 
oxales said troops remained on alert monday as a precaution 
troops armed with semiautomatic rifles and machine guns were seen 
guarding roadblocks on the eastern edge of the capital 
oxales said leaflets confiscated from the convoy offered rewards 
of up to 200000 for the capture of senior military officers loyal 
to mrs aquino 
participants were offered money to join the convoy and were told 
they would attend rallies at the presidential palace and elsewhere 
to protest economic grievances oxales said 
participants also were given liberation bonds they were told 
could be redeemed after the new government was installed oxales 
said 
authorities have foiled a half dozen coup attempts against mrs 
aquino the most serious took place aug 28 1987 when about 2000 
mutineers attacked military and media facilities in the capital at 
least 53 people were killed and more than 300 were wounded 
mutiny leader lt col gregorio gringo honasan was arrested 
in december 1987 but escaped in april

the marxist government plans to move 
600000 peasants into villages by june the ethiopian news agency 
reported 
the new program would bring to 149 million the number of people 
relocated in villages since the program begun four years ago the 
state news agency said that would be 40 percent of ethiopias rural 
population ena said 
the new quota was approved during a weekend meeting of the 
national villagization coordinating committee chaired by prime 
minister fikreselassie wogderess 
the program would include 12 of the nations 14 administrative 
provinces it said 
it did not identify the two uninvolved provinces but government 
sources identified them as eritrea and tigray two neighboring 
northern regions plagued by civil war 
secessionist eritrean rebels have been fighting for 27 years in 
africas oldest civil war while tigrean guerrillas took up arms 14 
years ago to press demands for autonomy 
ena said plans involve building 341 primary schools with 
construction of 231 to be financed by the swedish international 
development agency the only international organization helping the 
program 
most relief and aid organizations operating in ethiopia have 
refused to get involved in the relocation program because of 
previous allegations peasants were forced to leave their homes some 
at gunpoint 
president mengistu haile mariams government has admitted making 
some mistakes but promised this year that future exercises would be 
strictly voluntary 
critics say peasants are taken to illprepared barracklike 
villages where there often are none of the schools health clinics 
and piped water which the government says it can provide to 
centralized communities officials say they cannot bring such 
necessities to traditionally isolated parents with neighbors living 
miles apart in often rugged terrain accessible only by foot or mule 
the governments opponents say it wants to use the program it 
calls villagization to give it more control over its 47 million 
people who since the 1974 marxist revolution all are organized by 
rural farming or urban district associations that control things 
like food rations 
ethiopias agricultural policy is based on establishing state and 
cooperative farms through centralized villages though they have 
proved less productive than peasant farmers

the insurer of a wrecked ferryboat has agreed 
to pay 4 million to remove the vessel from a coral reef in puerto 
rico that is the home of hawksbill sea turtles an endangered 
species the justice department announced monday 
the 3568ton ferry a regina ran aground on the reef off mona 
island on feb 15 1985 on a daily trip from puerto rico to the 
dominican republic 
the hull carved a deep trench in the reef killing coral and 
fuel oil and debris damaged the reef seabed and beaches the 
justice department alleged in a civil complaint filed in us 
district court in san juan puerto rico 
hawksbills more than any other turtle species depend heavily on 
healthy coral reef habitat for shelter and food said the complaint 
adding that much of the hope for their survival and recovery depends 
on maintaining nesting beaches and foraging habitat 
under a proposed consent decree reached with standard steamship 
owners protection indemnity association bermuda ltd the 
insurance company will pay 403 million to remove the ferry and 
clean up debris 
the commonwealth of puerto rico also is a party to the consent 
decree under which it will receive at least 641000 for damages to 
its natural resources cleanup costs and future costs related to the 
removal project 
the consent decree was filed simultaneously with the complaint 
against standard steamship and armatur sa and tourship co 
sa the owners and operators of the ferry 
the agreement provides an excellent plan to prevent further 
damage to the ecology and to improve protection of sea turtles that 
live on and around mona island assistant attorney general roger 
marzulla head of the justice departments land and natural 
resources division said in a statement 
congress passed legislation authorizing the corps of engineers to 
transfer a surplus barge to a salvage company to help carry out the 
removal operation

the natural father of a girl who was adopted at 
birth more than seven years ago asked the supreme court on monday to 
restore parental rights he contends were revoked unconstitutionally 
edward mcnamara contends that san diego authorities 
unconstitutionally denied him the opportunity to raise the girl who 
was conceived during a brief romance with a woman that ended eight 
months before the babys birth 
mcnamara now 42 did not learn that he had become a father until 
after the infants birth and the mother sought his consent to put 
the child named katie up for adoption 
mcnamara sought custody soon after he learned of katies birth 
but california limits the rights of an unwed father to block an 
adoption 
attorney james e sutherland argued that california law 
unconstitutionally discriminates against unwed fathers by making it 
more difficult for them to assert rights as parents 
mr mcnamaras rights shouldnt be terminated except on the 
same grounds as the mothers sutherland told the justices noting 
that a lower court that denied custody had concluded nevertheless 
that his client was a loving father of two sons by a previous 
marriage 
mcnamara who is now seeking visitation rights was denied any 
opportunity to form any relationship with the child before she was 
put up for adoption by the mother who is not identified in court 
records 
but several justices expressed skepticism over mcnamaras claim 
that he was denied equal protection or denied his rights when 
authorities allowed the natural mother to place katie up for 
adoption without mcnamaras consent 
none of our cases hold that a father in your clients position 
has achieved a protected liberty chief justice william rehnquist 
told sutherland 
justice sandra day oconnor questioned why california didnt have 
authority to adopt a policy that the state will consider the best 
interests of the child over the alleged rights of the biological 
father 
oconnor asked sutherland if mcnamara could make the same claim 
if the childs conception had been the result of a socalled 
onenight stand 
if he had perfected all the rights manifesting significant 
parental interest he would be entitled to make the claim 
sutherland replied 
that would go significantly beyond the courts cases where 
there had been an established relationship between father and 
child oconnor said 
lloyd harmon jr counsel for san diego county defended 
californias policy of giving an unwed mother the primary right to 
decide whether to surrender a child for adoption 
the legal distinction between unwed fathers and unwed mothers 
furthers the state policy which is the speedy placement of 
children by putting them in suitable settings so they can nurture 
harmon argued 
most unwed fathers are not easily identifiable and are not 
necessarily interested in fatherhood he said 
biology in and of itself does not not create a substantial 
relationship or create a parental right harmon said there must 
be something substantial between the father and the child 
the decision to allow robert and pamela moses to adopt katie was 
not an intrusion into an existing family unit mr mcnamara and 
his daughter were never a family they never had any relationship 
the most they saw of each other may have been an hour and a 
half some seven years ago harmon said 
the justices are expected to decide the case by july 
outside the courtroom mrs moses who attended the hearing with 
her attorney refused to comment on the case 
mcnamara said he feels a great loss by not being able to be 
her father 
he said he has pursued the lengthy legal battle because it is 
my right to raise my daughter and i am not going to give that right 
up to anyone

i can remember hearing a big gust of wind like a hurricane and 
then i could hear the wood tearing and i thought oh god this is 
it im gone i just buried myself under the bed said betty bell

florida environmental officials expect to 
decide soon whether to grant a controversial 25year dredging permit 
for the apalachicola river considered vital by shipping interests 
in three states 
but the permit requested by the army corps of engineers is 
opposed by nearly everyone else including environmentalists and 
fishing interests 
if navigation survives and prospers the economy of the region 
benefits said homer hirt chief of the jackson county port 
authority in this florida panhandle river town 
hirt also is interim executive director of the tririvers 
waterway association which is lobbying for the permit on behalf of 
shippers in the panhandle alabama and georgia 
environmentalists oppose the permit because they believe 25 years 
is too long and because they contend the corps of engineers has 
failed to state exactly what it plans to do they also are worried 
that the dredging would destroy habitat for fish and wildlife 
corps biologist curtis flakes said the agency will safeguard the 
environment and that it has indicated what it intends to do through 
publication of a navigation maintenance plan 
the state department of environmental regulation is expected to 
make an internal decision in a few days said david arnold a 
spokesman for the agency 
congress in 1939 authorized the corps to maintain a navigation 
channel in the river 100 feet wide and 9 feet deep keeping both the 
river and its northern tributaries the chattahoochee and flint 
rivers in georgia and alabama open to traffic 
but the corps still must obtain permits from each of the states 
for dredging and removing snags such as fallen trees 
florida which benefits least from the river traffic but has the 
most to lose from an environmental standpoint has used its muscle 
over the years to reject some proposals and demand concessions 
before approving others 
such permits usually are granted for no more than five years a 
25year permit is unprecedented the corps current twoyear permit 
expires jan 31 
opposing the permit request are the florida defenders of the 
environment the us fish and wildlife service the national marine 
fisheries service the florida game and fresh water fish commission 
and the apalachee audubon society

environmental groups are going to have more to 
say than ever before about what goes into the next farm bill two 
analysts said monday 
the environment probably would benefit from the abolition of all 
government farm programs if current conservation incentives were 
retained said the study by resources for the future an 
environmental research organization 
but would those benefits outweigh the social costs to farmers 
the answer is probably not said katherine reichelderfer one of 
two authors of the study published through the research groups 
national center for food and agricultural policy 
such a policy would increase the number of acres planted to 
crops but would result in environmentally beneficial relocation and 
mix of production activities with less intensive and less damaging 
use of agricultural chemicals on expanded acreage the study said 
but it added farm income would decline agricultural exports 
would fall and rural communities and agribusiness interests would 
suffer 
in the last revision of farm programs in 1985 environmentalists 
were influential in forbidding benefits to farmers who convert 
grassland and swamps to crops and in establishing a conservation 
reserve in which farmers are paid rent to conat strikers occupying company 
facilities held more than 173000 boxes of bananas destined for 
export it said each box was worth 10 
yanez charged that united brands was sponsoring radio 
advertisements offering unemployed hondurans jobs honduran labor 
laws forbid employers to hire laborers to replace striking workers 
the company also has distributed leaflets from helicopters at the 
plantations urging strikers to return to work union officials said 
leaders of other honduran unions declared their support for the 
banana pickers strike 
the national campesino association was ready to join the strikers 
if necessary said association president luis lagos we have more 
than 25000 laborers available to defend the strike at united 
brands he said 
the coordinating council of campesino organizations of honduras 
with more than 300000 members also declared its support monday

opec oil ministers ended nearly two weeks 
of tense discussions monday with a formal agreement to limit 
production and pump prices back toward the cartels benchmark of 18 
per barrel 
but before the day was out one oil minister indicated his new 
quota was not official causing prices to back off after a sharp 
runup 
the accord which ended the winter meeting of the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries set an output ceiling of 185 million 
barrels a day for the 13 opec members well under the 225 million 
that analysts estimate the cartel is currently pumping 
the agreement also resolved a key issue in the talks by giving 
former combatants iran and iraq equal quotas of 264 million barrels 
a day 
after the agreement was announced futures prices for west texas 
intermediate a major us brand jumped as high as 1580 dollars a 
barrel up more than 180 from its close last week on the new york 
mercantile exchange 
but prices slipped toward the end of the day after the oil 
minister of the united arab emirates said the output level set in 
the accord was not his official ceiling 
the price of west texas intermediate for january delivery still 
managed to settle up 106 per barrel at 1503 
a pickup in crude prices if it holds could mean higher 
gasoline prices at the pump although oil companies do not 
necessarily pass along the full increase 
each one dollar rise in the price of crude oil theoretically 
means a pickup of 25 cents a gallon in retail gasoline prices 
the agreement takes effect jan 1 for six months opec president 
rilwanu lukman of nigeria predicted prices could reach 18 a barrel 
maybe by june 
i wouldnt mind it tomorrow he told a news conference but 
its not possible 
he said that if the countries cut their production as required 
prices will get a strong lift 
saudi arabias oil minister hisham nazer predicted the accord 
will have a very positive effect on the oil market 
indonesias oil minister ginandjar kartasasmita predicted the 
18 mark could be reached by next winter 
its a victory for opec said issam abdul raheem alchalabi 
oil minister of iraq 
feredoon barkeshli senior iranian delegate said im happy 
about it 
iran which until the agreement had vowed never to permit iraq an 
equal quota had a cap of 24 million under the cartels previous 
agreement and iraq 15 million 
iran retains its 1427 percent share of total opec output under 
the new accord iraq has the same portion 
other countries however lost a bit of their share to iraq 
saudi arabia the worlds largest exporter was given a 245 
percent share of total output compared to 262 percent previously 
its daily quota will be 452 million barrels up from 434 million 
barrels 
the new agreement promises steps will be taken to try to keep 
prices up and countries from cheating on their quotas past opec 
agreements have unraveled when the members cheated by exceeding 
their ceilings 
the statement by mana saeed otaiba the united arab emirates 
minister hinted at early trouble with the agreement but paul 
mlotok an analyst at salomon brothers in new york said the 
statement shouldnt surprise anyone because of the countrys 
repeated overproduction in the past 
he said he expected the agreement to largely hold theres 
going to be one main cheater the united arab emirates 
as long as that is all he said they wont fare too 
badly 
a critical element of the agreement was the inclusion of iraq it 
refused to join the accord arranged in 1986 because it wanted the 
same production ceiling as bitter rival iran 
we are happy to be back said alchalabi 
the meeting closed monday with the approval of the agreement the 
next ministerial meeting will be june 5 
opec members are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran iraq 
kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia united arab emirates 
and venezuela

six iranian clerics and three other men 
were executed in iran this month after being convicted of 
corruption the official islamic republic news agency reported 
monday 
the executions the latest in a series of executions announced by 
the government in the past five months heightened speculation of a 
new power struggle within the tehran regime 
irna monitored in nicosia said the men were executed after they 
made explicit admissions of guilt 
tehran radio also monitored in nicosia quoted iranian 
intelligence minister mohammad mohammadi reyshahri as saying the 
nine had been implicated in various offences 
several pseudoclergymen including omid najafabadi who was 
arrested some time ago were condemned to death after being tried 
and the executions have been carried out reyshahri said 
najafabadi a former deputy in parliament was arrested in 
december 1986 in connection with a scandal involving mehdi hashemi 
the brother of the soninlaw of ayatollah hussein ali montazeri 
the designated successor of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
hashemi was executed last year for treason terrorism and 
kidnapping after he exposed parliamentary speaker hashemi 
rafsanjanis clandestine contacts with the united states in the 
armsforhostages deal 
his execution brought into sharp focus the infighting between 
governing factions in tehran 
the irna report confirmed a claim earlier this month by irans 
main opposition group the iraqibased peoples holy warriors that 
a group of clergymen had been executed on khomeinis orders 
dissident iranian sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
claimed at the time that the victims were linked to montazeri the 
sources said montazeri had vehemently protested to khomeini 
the wave of mass executions that began in july 
the regime has blamed the stabbing death wednesday of former 
health minister kazem sami on the peoples holy warriors but the 
dissidents said monday that the killing was carried out on 
khomeinis personal order 
the iranian dissident sources say that the recent executions are 
part of a systematic campaign by rafsanjanis faction to eliminate 
montazeris supporters 
the power struggle centers on efforts by various groups to gain 
supremacy after the death of the 88yearold khomeini who is 
reported in poor health 
montazeri faces considerable opposition from powerful political 
figures such as rafsanjani the power struggle appears to have 
intensified after khomeinis decision to accept a unsponsored 
ceasefire in the 8yearold persian gulf war a move opposed by 
hardliners in tehran 
the peoples holy warriors claimed that khomeini and rafsanjani 
who as irans acting commanderinchief is the most powerful figure 
after the revolutionary patriarch want to make it abundantly 
clear that the consequence of nonconformity or dissent even 
within the regime is death 
a un report on human rights in iran issued in early november 
criticized iran for carrying out a wave of executions of 
opposition members following the ceasefire in the war 
the dissident iranian factions have said that more than 1100 
activists were executed before the ceasefire took effect aug 20 
iran announced friday it will allow the first visit by un human 
rights investigators by the end of december in hopes of refuting the 
reports of mass executions

with investigations of abuse going forward in 
nearly a fifth of the citys local public school districts mayor 
edward i koch asserted monday that decentralization should be 
reevaluated 
im not telling you decentralization is all bad but it cant 
be all good koch told reporters at city hall after a weekend in 
which allegations of sexual extortion surfaced in the probe of 
cocaine use and other misconduct in the bronx 
theres no question in my mind that the local school boards 
leave a lot to be desired koch said 
district attorney paul gentiles revelation that school board 
members in the bronx have been accused of demanding sex from 
teachers in return for jobs and promotions has made the burgeoning 
scandal more shocking than when the matter first came to public 
attention koch said 
in another weekend disclosure robert f wagner jr president of 
the central board of education told the new york post that the 
schools inspector general was investigating district boards 4 and 5 
in manhattan and 16 and 32 in brooklyn as well as boards 9 and 12 in 
the bronx already under investigation by the district attorney 
green has suspended the district 9 board pending results of the 
investigation an action the board planned to challenge in court 
schools chancellor richard green reiterated monday in a 
television interview that decentralization is on trial 
these people are elected theyre not appointed green said 
on the cbs morning news we would expect that if theyre going 
to make decentralization work were going to have to agree to a 
different set of rules than have been operating in some school 
districts 
green koch and wagner planned to go to albany on tuesday to 
continue lobbying the legislature to bar politicians from running 
for local boards and using them as bases for power and patronage 
they also want to return to the chancellor more power over 
principals of elementary and intermediate schools 
decentralization took effect 18 years ago over the opposition of 
50000 teachers whose bitter strike divided the city on racial 
lines it put control of the 800 schools for kindergarten through 
eighth or ninth grade in the hands of 32 locally elected district 
boards the high schools remained under jurisdiction of the central 
board 
the principle of community control in numerous instances 
yielded to the reality of 5 percent voter turnouts for school 
elections which effectively turned the boards over to the 
politically organized 
the current scandal began unfolding in the bronx early this month 
when matthew barnwell principal of ps 53 in district 9 was 
arrested on a charge of buying crack 
green suspended barnwell but was criticized for failing to 
follow up politically by going to the district to show concern and 
using the incident to seek power to get rid of inferior but 
tenureentrenched principals 
in the days that followed green hardened his line which 
included reversing his opposition to drug testing 
he announced last week that a new policy on testing for teachers 
and principals suspected of drug use would be taken up by the board 
dec 7 
gentile said over the weekend that at least two members of local 
school boards in the bronx have offered to cooperate with his 
investigators he did not identify either the members or their 
boards 
among the main allegations reportedly before the grand jury in 
the bronx were that some school board members used cocaine regularly

president augusto pinochet lashed out 
at the united states and its former ambassador to chile saying he 
did nothing but make political propaganda against the government 
ambassador harry barnes left chile on saturday after three years 
as the us envoy without the customary farewell meeting with the 
president 
in a speech sunday in vina del mar a coastal resort city 120 
miles northwest of santiago pinochet said he had snubbed the 
ambassador 
i did not shake his hand i did see him off i did not say 
goodbye said pinochet 
during his tenure barnes had angered the government by promoting 
greater political freedom and meeting with opposition leaders and 
human rights activists 
barnes replacement charles gillespie who is us ambassador in 
colombia is expected to arrive in early december 
pinochet speaking to his rightwing supporters accused the 
united states of trying to subjugate latin america by sowing dissent 
and by keeping its inhabitants in debt 
why did they give millions of dollars to the opposition he 
said because they know this government doesnt accept that 
they come to enslave us to subjugate this tiny country of 
12500000 inhabitants that they impose an envoy who does nothing 
but make political propaganda against the government 
congress last year voted to provide 1 million to organizations 
promoting democracy in chile which has been ruled by pinochet since 
he led a bloody 1973 military coup 
pinochet contends that foreign financing of the opposition helped 
to defeat him in an oct 5 referendum 
the ballot gave chileans the option to vote yes if they were 
in favor of the general remaining in power until 1997 or no if 
they opted for a free election whose winner would take office in 
1990

american farm export volume hit a sixyear peak 
of 1475 million metric tons in the year ended sept 30 with japan 
again the biggest customer the agriculture department said monday 
in dollar terms us agricultural exports climbed from 2787 
billion in fiscal 1987 to 352 billion this past year a gain of 26 
percent while imports of farm products were up 2 percent to a 
record 21 billion usda said 
that left the united states with a net agricultural trade surplus 
of 142 billion in black ink for fiscal 1988 compared with 722 
billion a year earlier 
export volume rose 14 percent from the 1292 million metric tons 
posted in fiscal 1987 with wheat accounting for twothirds of the 
increase usda said 
a metric ton is equivalent to about 2205 pounds 
wheat exports climbed from 282 million metric tons in 1987 to 
405 million tons in the last fiscal year the soviet union and 
china together purchased a total of 146 million tons of that 
amount or 36 percent of all us wheat shipments in fiscal 1988 
the soviet union and china together imported 495 million metric 
tons of american wheat or 18 percent of total shipments in 1987 
japan led all customers importing 278 million metric tons of 
us agricultural goods other leading purchasers were the european 
community 255 million metric tons the soviet union 159 million 
metric tons south korea 8 million and taiwan 73 million 
in addition to wheat considerable tonnage gains were posted by 
corn grain sorghum feeds and fodders and vegetable oils among 
products not measured on the basis of metric tons the biggest gains 
were in baby chicks live animals fruit juices wines and malt 
beverages 
the surging gains however were moderated a bit by weakened 
foreign demand for us soybeans soybean meal and rice 
the agriculture department said all leading foreign markets grew 
in fiscal 1988 except that of the european community whose imports 
of us agricultural goods dropped nearly 11 million metric tons 
the decrease mainly reflected fewer purchases of soybean and soybean 
meal 
indeed the soviet union and japan were among the five 
fastestgrowing markets for us agriculture joining china algeria 
and india 
on the dollar value side american highvalue exports such as 
livestock and horticultural products climbed to a record 164 
billion in 1988 a gain of 27 billion or 19 percent over the 1987 
level it also represented a 11 billion gain over the previous 
peak reached in 1981 
exports of bulk commodities shot up 33 percent from 1987 to a 
total of 188 billion the level topped 25 billion in 1984 before 
immense crop surpluses and stiffer foreign competition battered 
prices and sent american agriculture into the doldrums 
increased purchases of wheat and corn were the main reason for 
the increase usda said it said the soviet union china and north 
africa were the leading markets for wheat and japan while the 
soviet union and south korea were tops for corn 
agricultural imports of 21 billion were some 250 million or 2 
percent above the 1987 level and about 100 million over the 1986 
mark of 209 billion the previous record high usda said the 
increase was not limited to any single commodity group but instead 
reflected modest increases in nearly all major competitive items 
top suppliers were the european community 412 billion 
canada 237 billion mexico 19 billion brazil 19 billion 
and australia 115 billion products reflecting increases were 
vegetable oil live cattle beef and veal wines and malt beverages 
and nursery products 
there were drops in imports of sugar pork fur coffee and 
spices

a couple in this rural rhode island 
community have stopped paying taxes on 11 acres of land because they 
dont know where it is but that hasnt deterred town officials from 
plans to sell the parcel for back taxes 
the land has been taxed since 1970 even though it apparently does 
not exist 
in that year victor nascimento of east providence and a brother 
now dead bought the land near an old boy scout camp for 2100 
they obtained a quitclaim deed on the property which protects 
the seller from responsibility if a problem is revealed in the 
title because they did not have enough money to spend on a title 
search and survey nascimento said 
nascimento and his wife lois intended the purchase to be an 
investment without ever inspecting the land they paid a total of 
2500 in taxes between 1970 and 1985 when a town official informed 
mrs nascimento that the lots status was in question 
the couple now are seeking to get their money back 
nancy hinchliffe the towns tax assessor said the company that 
drew up the towns first tax maps in 1972 left the nascimento 
property out because it couldnt find it she said the nascimentos 
were informed back in the 1970s that the deed did not represent 
specific property but they paid their taxes anyway 
hinchliffe said taxes must be levied against all deeds registered 
with the town even if the deeds stand for nothing 
linda czerkiewicz the town tax collector said the rules also 
call for property to be sold if taxes are more than two years 
delinquent 
however czerkiewicz admitted i cant understand people buying 
property not knowing where it is

the congress of the international chess 
federation on monday decided to postpone a decision on whether to 
ban a player for life and strip him of his grandmaster title for 
competing in south africa 
miguel quinteros of argentina already banned from competitions 
for three years following two visits to south africa played a 
sixgame exhibition match in johannesburg in september 
silvanus ebigwe of nigeria chairman of the federations 
commission on south africa also recommended to delegates that 
quinteross name be erased from all future documents of the 
127member governing body of chess known by its french acronym 
fide 
while the proposal received strong african support others 
questioned the severity of the proposed action against the 
40yearold argentinian and whether a title gained in competition 
could ever be removed for a political act 
while i agree we should certainly not send teams to south 
africa we are not talking about teams were talking about 
individuals said ian josephs a british citizen representing 
monaco 
we are not policeman we are here because we love chess youre 
trying to stop the man working for the rest of his life and hes not 
here to speak hes got no representation what kind of justice is 
that said josephs whose speech was applauded by some delegates 
georgios makropoulos of greece said the rights of one or two 
individual players must be set against the rights of many others in 
africa 
eventually the decision was postponed until the next fide 
congress scheduled for august in puerto rico 
the proposed banning for one year of grandmaster karl robatsch of 
austria for competing in a south african event also was postponed 
until august 
fide president florencio campomanes of the philippines said he 
would contact robatsch and quinteros before the august congress 
south africa membership of fide was revoked in 1982 because of 
its policy of apartheid

conservationists urged adoption monday 
of a rule that would reopen florida waters to limited redfish 
harvests after a 19month ban but commercial fishermen dont like 
the proposed season 
gov bob martinez and the state cabinet are scheduled to consider 
the rule dec 6 if approved recreational anglers could be catching 
redfish within a month commercial harvests would remained banned 
once sought for the famed cajunstyle blackened redfish the fish 
was overharvested and in danger of depletion when the state ordered 
a halt in april 1987 to all redfish harvests from florida waters and 
sales of florida redfish 
since stocks have rebounded the marine fisheries commission has 
suggested allowing one redfish catch per person a day during the 
ninemonth season eligible fish would be 18 to 27 inches long to 
protect breeding fish and no sales of the fish would be permitted 
we are convinced that this recommended rule is the most 
equitable way to allow a very limited harvest while insuring the 
protection and future of this valuable marine resource said ted 
forsgren director of the florida conservation association 
but jerry sansom director of the organized fishermen of florida 
said the species has recovered more than enough to support 
commercial harvests and he accused the conservationists of trying 
to mislead the public and state officials 
he said the proposed daily bag limit could amount to 750000 
redfish caught each year up to 50 times the number harvested each 
year of snook the next mostabundant game fish 
its better for them certainly but its not better for us 
theyre saying they cant allow the commercial fisherman to harvest 
any because there arent enough said sansom if thats a very 
limited harvest weve just invented some new words 
alabama louisiana south carolina and texas have banned redfish 
harvests federal waters in the gulf of mexico also are closed to 
redfish harvests

concerned calls from citizens about a 
white goose stuck in the ice on a park lake precipitated an 
elaborate rescue effort likened to the recent whale saga at barrow 
alaska 
we had our own version of the soviet icebreaker that 
eventually freed the alaskan whales said police dispatcher lori 
burbach of sundays episode 
the goose was trapped in thin ice 40 feet from shore on the lake 
adjoining the littleton historical museum 
the rescue took four hours of effort by three policemen state 
division of wildlife workers and parks employees 
patrolman bill christensen said that the wildlife division guy 
and the south suburban parks guy put a johnboat on the ice then 
the two of them kind of like the whales they had to break it 
the ice with shovels and an ax to get it to float to the goose 
said fire dispatcher susan jones 
it probably cost the city 300 she added but said the 
public outcry would have been intense if the rescue had not been 
undertaken 
news that a television crew was on its way to the rescue scene 
helped step it up a little bit burbach said 
the goose waddled off with the rest of its flock after the 
rescue burbach said

will you keep avoiding briefings 
fitzwater glanced at his watch a twominute honeymoon he

conflict with humor

bush said he chose fitzwater who was his vice presidential press 
secretary from 1985 to 1987 because i think hes the best 
the spokesman has received high marks from many reporters 
covering the white house but there also have been complaints that 
he is too easygoing and too often skips his daily white house 
briefings for reporters 
fitzwater was philosophical about the criticism 
facing the white house press corps every day is no day at the 
beach he said 
as to how long he would remain he said i figure you do this 
job the way you run the quarter mile you run as long and hard as 
you can and as fast as you can and when you drop they bring in 
someone else 
he said the offer from bush which came in a telephone call to 
his office at 830 in the morning came as a surprise 
i was making plans to leave he said he said he would call 
his two children and tell them the news as soon as they got out of 
school fitzwater divorced has a son and daughter 
fitzwaters selection marks the first time any incoming president 
has chosen as his permament press secretary the same individual who 
did the job for his predecessor president kennedys press 
secretary pierre salinger stayed on briefly after kennedys 
assassination 25 years ago but president lyndon b johnson soon 
replaced him with bill moyers 
fitzwater grew up on a farm in abilene kan 
as a high school student he planted tulips at the eisenhower 
library in abilene there was a huge picture of ike and jim 
hagerty eisenhowers press secretary he said in an interview 
last year even then i wondered what it would be like to have 
that job 
he landed it in february 1987 after larry speakes resigned 
speakes had taken over the duties from james brady who was 
seriously wounded in an attempt on the presidents life in march 
1981 
the job pays 77400 a year 
bush said he had asked fitzwater to remain as press secretary 
the title that normally goes with the position of presidential 
spokesman in the reagan administration that title had been reserved 
for brady 
asked if brady would have a role in the new administration 
fitzwater said bush had raised the question internally and that 
the vice president and his advisers have some ideas of things they 
would like him to do 
from 1981 until 1983 fitzwater was press spokesman at the 
treasury department 
earlier he served nine years as a spokesman at the environmental 
protection agency after working as a speechwriter for 
thentransportation secretary john volpe and at the appalachian 
regional commission 
he was a deputy white house press secretary from 1983 to 1985 
when he joined the vice presidents staff 
he was a correspondent and editor with a number of kansas 
newspapers before coming to washington 
fitzwater made no commitments as to how often bush would meet 
with reporters but said i knew him before to be an open person 
willing to deal with the press and i think he will be again

former presidential aide oliver l north on 
monday moved to exclude independent counsel lawrence e walsh from 
closed court hearings on secret documents the irancontra prosecutor 
wants to use as evidence 
in a brief filing defense lawyers asked us district judge 
gerhard a gesell for permission to file a motion to bar walsh and 
his associates from attending hearings set to begin wednesday 
defense lawyers meanwhile dismissed as mere spin control a 
prosecution allegation that the former national security council 
aide was threatening to reveal government secrets to scuttle charges 
against him 
no reason was given for norths request to exclude prosecutors 
from the hearings which will consider defense objections to 
deleting sensitive references from some 350 prosecution exhibits 
but the former presidential aides lawyers presumably are set to 
argue that allowing walsh and his associates to attend the hearing 
would give them an unfair preview of the defenses case 
the government has granted walsh permission to use the 1000 
pages to 2000 pages of classified material as evidence against 
north in a public trial provided certain sensitive information is 
deleted 
the references include names of countries foreign officials and 
us intelligence agents operating abroad 
north has objected to virtually all the proposed deletions and 
gesell ordered him to show why the references are important for 
defending charges he conspired to illegally divert usiran 
armssale profits to the nicaraguan rebels 
last summer gesell gave north an opportunity to detail why he 
needed classified documents at a closed hearing to which the 
prosecution was not invited 
a spokesman for walshs office said the independent counsel would 
oppose norths request to bar prosecutors from the hearings 
north meanwhile urged gesell to reject walshs request that he 
be prohibited from using as defense evidence some 40000 pages of 
classified documents 
walsh contended that north listed many of the documents in his 
nov 14 notice simply to provoke a dismissal of the charges 
against him by threatening to disclose some of the nations 
bestkept secrets 
but norths lawyers said gesell should reject walshs assertion 
that we have somehow threatened national security or engaged in 
graymail by taking the first step required by statute to protect 
this nations secrets 
the lawyers urged rejection of what it called walshs frontal 
assault on defendant norths fundamental fifth and sixth amendment 
right to present a defense 
under the independent counsels perverse regime the trial 
would not be a search for truth witnesses could not tell what they 
knew about the facts critical documents would never be presented to 
the jury and the verdict would rest upon a distorted sliver of 
information selected almost entirely by the prosecution 
no date has been set for norths trial the first of four ordered 
by gesell for the conspiracy charges against the former presidential 
aide former national security adviser john m poindexter and arms 
dealers albert hakim and retired air force maj gen richard v 
secord

when he returned to look at the painting at about 440 pm it 
was gone 
kiley said the painting probably was taken during a showing of 
the videotape 
the thief apparently took the painting from the wall walked 
about 35 feet to the front door and got away said kiley

sunday and about 26 visitors were in the museum when the theft was 
discovered many of the visitors who signed a guest book on sunday 
were being interviewed by police 
at this point we have no suspects said kiley 
the exact value of the work was not disclosed over concern of 
possible ransom by the thieves or help in marketing the work kiley 
and hadley both said it was worth more than 1 million 
patricia reiss a spokeswoman for the town of huntington which 
owns the museum said town officials will be meeting with its 
insurance company to discuss a settlement on the stolen property 
it was the first theft of artwork from the museum which was 
built in 1920 reiss said

estonias communist party chief has defied moscow 
by saying his republic will not retreat just because the kremlin 
objects to its declaration of sovereignty 
a spokesman said party leader vaijno vyalyas declared on estonian 
television sunday night that the rejection of the republics 
declaration doesnt mean well accept the decrees of moscow 
vyalyas statements intensified the constitutional crisis as the 
federal parliament prepared to revise the charter 
estonias legislature voted almost unanimously nov 16 to declare 
the tiny baltic republic independent of moscow in all but defense 
and foreign affairs it said new laws passed by the national 
parliament would not apply in estonia unless the legislature 
approved them 
valle feldman spokesman for the estonian foreign ministry 
quoted vyalyas as saying in the televised speech sunday night we 
will not retreat feldman was reached by telephone in tallinn 
capital of estonia 
the party leaders remarks were broadcast shortly after a report 
on national television of the meeting of the presidium of the 
supreme soviet at which estonias declaration of sovereignty was 
declared unconstitutional 
president mikhail s gorbachev chairman of the presidium said 
in his speech to the parliamentary executive body if we took this 
road to division it would slow down development and result in huge 
losses it runs counter to the entire course of perestroika 
economic reform and democratization of public life 
perestroika is gorbachevs name for his program of economic and 
social reform 
four related amendments to the estonian constitution also were 
rejected by the presidium according to a report monday in the party 
newspaper pravda 
the amendments give estonia power to veto soviet laws claim the 
republics land natural resources and industry as the property of 
the republic give citizens the right to challenge governmental 
actions in court and legalize private property 
gorbachev was particularly offended by the last item private 
property is the basis of exploitation of man by man he said it 
is a deeply erroneous decision 
vyalyas who had been considered a gorbachev ally said on 
estonian television he and other leaders in the republic had fully 
expected a negative reaction from moscow feldman reported but 
that doesnt mean well accept the decrees of moscow 
only the estonian parliament can change the decisions of the 
estonian parliament the spokesman said we have rights and 
moscow has rights too 
the communist partys 300member central committee and the 
1500member supreme soviet are meeting in moscow about gorbachevs 
constitutional changes which estonia and some of the 14 other 
republics say shifts too much power to moscow 
on sunday the populist estonian popular front said the presidium 
attempt to cancel the estonian amendments violated the estonian 
constitution journalist tarmu tammerk of the tallinn newspaper 
kodumaa reported 
it violates the republics right to selfdetermination a 
guarantee currently enshrined in the soviet constitution tammerk 
explained that section is among those up for revision at tuesdays 
meeting of the national parliament 
although gorbachev has favored ending central economic control 
and encouraged greater local responsibility he denounced the 
estonian notion that the republic rather than moscow should control 
land and factories 
it would preclude the possibility of conducting a single 
socioeconomic policy making it impossible to distribute production 
forces rationally and to create single transport systems and power 
grids he said 
he expressed shock at the notion of dividing railways and turning 
over huge metallurgical operations but did hold out the possibility 
of local control in such light industry as food supply local 
transport and trade medical care schools and restaurants 
gorbachev also left the door open to future negotiations with the 
estonian leadership about the problems that prompted the challenge 
declaring to the presidium we ought to see the legitimacy of the 
real questions which estonia has come to face and which demand 
solution he said 
kremlin leaders share the indigation of estonians about the 
cavalier use of nature by certain moscow ministries he said 
pollution by factories controlled from moscow was one of estonias 
complaints

a former fundraiser for lyndon h 
larouche jr testified monday it became increasingly clear that 
the larouche movement didnt plan to repay loans made to its 
organizations but acknowledged he had been far less critical in 
previous court testimony 
christian curtis of alexandria testified at larouches conspiracy 
trial that the threetime presidential candidates political 
movement raised money under false pretenses and did not tell those 
lending it money that their loans were not likely to be repaid 
curtis said he left the larouche organization in may 1986 after 
it became increasingly clear to me there was a policy they were 
not going to repay the loans 
larouche and six associates are on trial in us district court 
on charges they conspired to defraud the lenders with a scheme to 
avoid repayment of their loans larouche alone is charged with 
conspiring to defraud the internal revenue service by failing to pay 
taxes and not declaring as income household and personal services 
provided by laroucherun organizations 
curtis told the jury that he and other larouche fundraisers were 
instructed to tell those who complained about nonrepayment of 
loans were in the midst of a war fighting for the human race in 
war there are casualties 
another prosecution witness audrey b carter testified she 
loaned a larouche organization 20000 and received only 500 in 
interest as a repayment 
ms carter said larouche fundraiser michael billington had 
promised her the loan would be repaid in a year at 10 percent 
interest billington told her she testified that her money was 
as safe as in the bank 
curtis also said larouche organizers concocted a fundraising 
scheme in which potential givers were falsely told their money was 
needed to publish a larouche antidrug book because latin american 
leaders urged that the publication be rushed into print 
but under crossexamination defense attorney william moffitt 
showed curtis statements he had made to federal and state law 
enforcement officers and in testimony at a larouche trial in boston 
earlier this year 
curtis was forced to acknowledge repeatedly his earlier 
statements that larouche operatives acted in good faith to repay 
the loans but were unable to do so because the movement was engaged 
in financial warfare 
the latter statement backs the contention of larouche and his 
codefendants that they intended to repay some 30 milliion in loans 
but were unable to do so when they had to divert money to defend 
themselves against harassment by the government and news media 
curtis also acknowledged to jurors that he testified in the 
earlier trial that he did not believe the nonrepayment was the 
result of a scam but stemmed from the irresponsibility and 
negligence of larouche staffers 
you swore to tell the truth at the boston trial moffitt 
asked 
i did curtis said 
under friendlier questioning from assistant us attorney john 
markham curtis said chief larouche fundraiser william wertz a 
defendant in the case established quotas for his subordinates 
when quotas were not met curtis said wertz accused the staffers 
of being impotent with lacking killer instinct and being 
not sufficiently ruthless 
asked by markham to describe the reaction of larouche staffers to 
such tirades curtis said i saw a number of people break down and 
cry some became hysterical over the telephone and started shouting 
at contacts calling them names i saw organizers become visibly 
distraught and become depressed 
larouche was indicted in october on 13 counts of mail fraud 
conspiracy to commit mail fraud and conspiracy to defraud the irs 
the mail fraud counts stem from promissory notes and letters of 
credit sent through the mails by the larouche organization 
conviction on all counts could carry a maximum penalty of 65 years 
in prison and fines of 325 million for larouche 
the six associates face lesser sentences if convicted of the mail 
fraud and conspiracy charges 
in the tax conspiracy count the federal grand jury charged that 
larouche has not filed a federal income tax return since at least 
1979

the ruling national liberation front 
reelected president chadli bendjedid as party chief monday night 
and a chose a new central committee to help him achieve political 
reform 
as secretarygeneral of algerias only party bendjedid becomes 
the sole candidate in a presidential election the party congress set 
for dec 22 the election in which he seeks his third fiveyear 
term originally was to have been held in february 
the new 155member central committees membership is roughly 
onethird each from local chapters government and party officials 
and associations and professional groups party professionals and 
the army dominated the outgoing central committee 
i need your help because the mission is difficult the task is 
long and the problems are great bendjedid 59 told the 5078 
delegates as the sixth party congress ended 
the renewal of your confidence is a support for the political 
reform proposals of which a part have already been applied and 
others are going to be i promise to do my best to implement your 
political program 
bendjedids opening speech sunday at the twoday congress was 
less forceful than expected sources at the meeting said privately 
he appeared to want a compromise with those in the army and party 
apparatus who opposed his reform plans 
part of that compromise apparently involved postponing a 
multiparty system in algeria 
for two years bendjedid has been trying to loosen the grip of 
the national liberation front on daytoday government operations 
the front originally the military organization that won algerias 
independence from france in 1962 later became the sole legal 
political party 
momentum for change was increased by a week of riots in october 
in which 176 were killed by official count and hundreds wounded 
there were numerous reports of torture by police 
the first series of reforms mostly changes to the constitution 
were approved in a nationwide referendum nov 3 among the changes 
were wider powers accorded the premier and making the premier 
directly responsible to parliament instead of the president 
in his opening speech bendjedid said a a multiparty state could 
come at at a later date if all agreed on the need for it a 
multiparty system now he said represented a threat to the unity of 
the nation 
the foreign press has been barred from directly covering the 
congress and denied access to the conference hall although algerian 
news organizations are covering the event 
abdelhamid mehri the no 2 man in the party said at a news 
conference the subject of introducing a multiparty system was not 
raised before the 5078 delegates to the congress 
instead bendjedid has focused on bringing new blood into the 
existing party noting that many honest and patriotic people 
have not joined mehri said 
the national liberation front is not going to withdraw from 
political life mehri said it will continue as a political 
force that will be active at all levels 
he said the first step was to open a wider dialogue involving as 
many people and groups as possible 
for now we cant talk about parties or associations because 
now they dont exist he said 
he said that under the reforms to be proposed to parliament 
independent candidacies outside the party framework would be allowed 
in elections for local and national assemblies

prime minister yitzhak shamirs rightwing likud 
bloc asked labor on monday to join a new coalition government 
offering the rival party two of the four most powerful cabinet posts 
shamir met with the centerleft partys leaders foreign minister 
shimon peres and defense minister yitzhak rabin it was the first 
meeting since the nov 1 election between shamir and peres who have 
been in a tenuous national unity coalition since indecisive 1984 
elections 
likud won 40 of the 120 parliament seats nov 1 and labor got 39 
the rest went to small parties 18 of them to ultraorthodox 
religious parties that could be kingmakers in a rightwing coalition 
neither likud nor labor ministers would reveal details of the 
mondays discussion peres said labor would respond to the offer 
later this week 
we decided to bring the proposals without any recommendation 
there is no need to the party bureau the body authorized to 
decide based on the offers we got whether to go to negotiations or 
not peres said after briefing labor ministers 
the government under discussion would be similar to the 
4yearold coalition but shamir would be prime minister all four 
years rather than switching jobs with peres at midtern as happened 
in 1986 
labor broke off coalition talks with likud last week calling its 
offer of one senior cabinet post insufficient the prime ministry 
foreign defense and finance are considered senior posts 
shamir subsequently offered peres the foreign ministry israel 
radio said despite his opposition to his rivals proposal for an 
international middle east peace conference and differences on terms 
of peace with the arabs 
likud already agreed to offer labor the defense ministry so 
labor would have two senior posts and likud would control the prime 
ministers office and the finance ministry 
the radio said that likud overall insists on having likud 
ministers outnumber labor ministers by at least one on the full 
cabinet 
the latest offer from likud comes after shamirs efforts to 
construct a coalition with small religious and rightwing parties 
stalled following squabbles over cabinet posts and demands for 
religious legislation that has split jews worldwide 
the religious parties were demanding a new immigration law that 
would deny immediate israeli citizenship to jews converted by reform 
or conservative rabbis reserving citizenship only for orthodox 
converts 
the likud ministers made no decision in mondays meeting about 
what foreign policy a likudlabor government might formulate the 
issue is likely to be a major stumbling block in negotiations 
israeli news reports said likud would insist that peres be barred 
from openly advocating an international middle east peace conference 
in the election campaign peres called for trading land for peace 
and launching negotiations under the umbrella of an international 
conference shamir rejected territorial compromise and called for 
direct talks aimed at granting the palestinians limited autonomy

a federal judge ordered the 
extradition to west germany of former nazi ss capt josef 
schwammberger who is accused of killing at least 5000 people most 
of them jews at forced labor camps 
schwammbergers lawyers said they would appeal mondays ruling on 
grounds his responsibility was limited because he was obeying orders 
from superiors 
schwammberger 76 commanded labor camps in occupied poland 
during world war ii he was arrested nov 13 1987 in huerta 
grande a village 500 miles northwest of buenos aires and has been 
jailed since in this city 31 miles south of the capital 
at a deportation hearing in july three survivors of the przemysl 
and mielec labor camps testified that schwammberger personally shot 
jews starved prisoners and set dogs on them 
he was a sadist an evil person edward blonder of miami 
testified 
at the time of his arrest schwammberger was among the 
mostwanted nazis on a list compiled by the wiesenthal center of 
vienna austria 
we believe that the judge ruled correctly we think the chances 
of winning an appeal are remote rabbi marvin hier director of 
the los angeles branch of the simon wiesenthal center for holocaust 
studies said in a telephone interview 
west germany requested schwammbergers extradition acourt in 
stuttgart issued an order for his arrest in 1973 
we already have been asked by the government of west germany to 
find witnesses for his trial there hier said 
its usually difficult to find witnesses so many years after 
the crime to have so many witnesses that personally saw him commit 
the crime of murder is an indication of the magnitude of his 
crimes 
many top nazis fled to south america when it became clear that 
germanys defeat was in inevitable 
adolf eichmann architect of the final solution in which jews 
were rounded up and executed was kidnapped in buenos aires in 1960 
by israeli agents convicted at a trial in jerusalem and hanged 
argentine police currently have been asked to find abraham kipp 
a former citizen of holland sentenced to death for crimes committed 
during world war ii 
last month a dutch parliamentarian urged the arrest and 
extradition of kipp who in 1949 was convicted for his part in the 
arrests of dozens of dutch jews by german police during the nazi 
occupation in 19401945 
kipp became a naturalized argentine in 1953 schwammberger 
arrived in argentina in 1949 and obtained citizenship in 1965 
schwammberger lived in la plata and worked for a chemical company 
for many years officials said

officials of the european economic community 
have decided against having talks in washington this week to explore 
prospects for averting a trade battle over the eecs scheduled jan 
1 ban of meat from animals treated with growth hormones 
they just saw the americans the weekend before last and theyll 
see them again in another week said ella krucoff speaking for 
the communitys delegation in washington 
us producers stand to lose meat sales which totaled about 169 
million last year in the 12 eec nations and administration 
officials say presidentelect george bush could retaliate with 
restrictions against the sale of european meat products or even 
some industrial products in the united states 
patricia f stolfa of the agriculture departments food safety 
and inspection service said the value of the european meat exports 
to the united states is higher because they include high quality 
items like danish ham the us market in europe on the other hand 
includes a large quantity of cheaper cuts such as hearts and 
kidneys she said 
the use of hormones to speed animal growth is forbidden in the 
eecs member nations which include west germany britain italy 
holland denmark ireland luxembourg the netherlands belgium 
spain portugal and greece 
however there have been widespread reports of illegal use of 
hormones by european producers and ms stolfa suggested it could be 
appropriate to delay the import ban while the european parliament 
completes an investigation already in progress 
earlier monday us officials said imminent talks were possible 
in washington and the eec would be represented by willy de clercq 
a belgian in charge of external affairs for the european commission 
and frans andriessen a netherlander and top agricultural official 
but they apparently decided to wait for a meeting in montreal 
beginning dec 5 when us trade representative clayton yeutter and 
agriculture secretary richard e lyng are due to review trade issues 
with representatives of nearly 100 nations 
lester m crawford of the food safety and inspection service said 
the hormones used on us cattle do not leave residues that are 
harmful to humans he said scientists in europe have supported the 
us position 
the reagan administration has proposed that international 
decisions on the safety of hormones be entrusted to the codex 
alimentarius commission a united nations body with 129 governments 
as members

a soyuz tm7 spacecraft carrying a joint 
sovietfrench team docked monday with the mir orbiting space 
station the official soviet news agency tass said 
the capsule which will remained docked almost a month was 
manned by soviet cosmonauts alexander volkov and sergei krikalev and 
frenchman jeanloup chretien tass said the soyuz capsule was fitted 
with a new guidance system that simplified rendezvous and docking 
and cut down on fuel consumption 
it said the three men entered mir after checking air locks and 
that they and the three cosmonauts already aboard mir all were 
feeling well 
volkov krikalev and chretien blasted off from the baikonur 
cosmodrome in soviet central asia on saturday with french president 
francois mitterrand on hand to watch 
tass said the soyuzs engines were fired in the 32nd and 33rd 
orbit monday bringing it 25 miles closer to the space station and 
then an automatic guidance system brought the capsule to within 400 
yards of the space station 
at that point the soyuz started circling until it reached a 
distance of 150 yards and mission control gave the order for its 
crew to move in and dock 
tass said the soyuz is attached to the kvant orbiting laboratory 
which docked with the space station last march 
chretien is to return to earth on dec 21 with cosmonauts musa 
manarov and vladimir titov who will be completing a full year in 
orbit earlier this month they broke the space endurance record set 
by cosmonaut yuri romanenko in 1987 
volkov and krikalev will replace manarov and titov 
chretien is to make a space walk to install some equipment and 
conduct tests during his month in space

an american scientist who tested rats 
flown aboard an unmanned soviet spacecraft said monday he found 
lower levels of a hormone affecting the rodents bone and muscle 
mass 
wesley c hymer director of the nasafunded center for cell 
research said learning why growth hormone levels were reduced in 
the rats could have implications on lengthy space missions and 
osteoporosis research 
astronauts have experienced bone and muscle losses during space 
flight a possible hindrance to lengthy missions such as a manned 
space station or journey to mars 
one could think about using space as a research laboratory for 
studying osteoporosis said hymer a 53yearold biochemistry 
professor at penn state university who has worked with nasa since 
1978 
the changes that one sees in space with regard to loss of bone 
mass and mineral density not only parallel and mimic what you find 
here on earth but they happen quicker he said 
some 24 million americans most of them elderly suffer from 
osteoporosis a loss of bone tissue that results in brittle bones 
according to the washingtonbased national osteoporosis foundation 
hymers tests on cells from five rats aboard a 12day flight on 
the soviet cosmos biosatellite flight last october duplicated 
results of an earlier experiment he conducted on 24 rats aboard a 
us space shuttle mission in 1985 both experiments showed the 
release of growth hormone reduced by about half in rats who were in 
weightless conditions 
the next step is to find out why hymer said 
next summer hymer plans to test cells of five more rats flown 
aboard a soviet biosatellite to see how they respond to a chemical 
from the brain that causes growth hormone to be released from the 
pituitary gland 
hymer also has received permission to conduct further research 
about a future shuttle mission 
in that experiment expected to find a space shuttle berth 
sometime in the next two years hymer plans to send growth hormone 
producing cells from the pituitary gland into space to see how they 
respond to weightlessness 
hymers research was one of 27 american projects aboard the 
cosmos flight last year he collaborated with three soviet 
researchers who were to release the findings this week in moscow 
man has been in space for over 30 years we know that there are 
changes that occur we certainly dont know about the mechanisms 
that are involved said hymer 
we need desperately to do more research in the space 
environment he added 
charles redmond a nasa spokesman said that in the absence of 
american missions the availability of cosmos flights has kept us 
life sciences research going in space 
americans have been able to conduct experiments aboard six soviet 
biosatellite missions under an agreement first signed during the 
nixon administration 
the national aeronautics and space administration has not had 
room for any life sciences research since the challenger spacelab 3 
in 1985 a space life sciences mission is scheduled for 1991 
redmond said 
nasa also has planned to launch biannual lifesat flights similar 
to the cosmos missions beginning in late 1990 or 1991 redmond said 
soviet scientists would be invited to participate in research 
conducted aboard those flights he said

the bush administration will have to request a 
2 percent real increase in defense spending next year unless it 
wants to reduce military strength overseas and cut aircraft carrier 
deployments defense secretary frank c carlucci said monday 
at 2 percent real growth our current defense budget is 
executeable carlucci said in response to a question after 
delivering a speech marking natos 40th birthday 
now obviously if you go from 2 percent real growth to zero 
real growth just matching inflation youve got a problem and 
over a fiveyear period that problem is about 116 billion in 
programs he continued 
i think our force structure is about as low as you can sensibly 
get it and still execute our military strategy around the world if 
additional force structure cuts are required youre going to have 
to look at such things as deployable carrier battle groups and some 
force structure overseas 
the only alternative to cuts in strength would be the 
unfortunate way that we did it in the 1970s which is in effect to 
hollow out our forces shortchange them in ammunition readiness 
let the quality of our people erode and i hope we would avoid 
that 
carlucci spoke at a conference sponsored by the institute of 
foreign policy analysis lauding the north atlantic treaty 
organizations success over the past 40 years in maintaining the 
peace and offering his prescription for the future 
as he has done previously carlucci said the alliance had to 
maintain a firm sense of realism about the soviet unions 
intentions judging russias actions and not the promises of 
glasnost 
he also said all the members of the alliance needed to increase 
their monetary and political support for defense and continue to 
modernize their weapons systems 
the us government should not ask for greater european spending 
with an eye toward reducing its own contributions to nato but as 
a way of nurturing defense cooperation carlucci said 
carlucci who has made it clear he expects to step down from his 
post when vice president george bush is inaugurated as president on 
jan 20 said he was proceeding with plans to submit a fiscal 1990 
pentagon budget request in january that would include money to 
increase spending by 2 percent after inflation 
the fiscal 1989 budget totals about 300 billion bush will be 
free to accept or modify the fiscal 1990 proposal before congress 
considers it 
my position is that we ought to continue to argue for the 2 
percent real increase carlucci said 
domestic programs continue to rise at a rate of about 8 
percent i see nothing wrong with 2 percent real growth in our 
defense budget particularly coming on the heels of a 12 percent 
total cut over the past four years 
at the same conference brent scowcroft named by bush to be the 
national security adviser in the next administration said there are 
a lot of problems that the united states and nato nations face 
in the future 
the two sides will have to work out ways to share the burden of 
defense and keep their collective wits about them in regard to 
the soviets he said

two officers wearing bulletproof vests were disarmed 
and fatally shot in the head monday as they struggled with a man 
released from prison 10 days ago police said 
the man who had served eight years in prison for attempted 
murder fled in one of the officers patrol cars and stole another 
car at gunpoint before he was arrested in neighboring broward 
county police said 
one metrodade police officer died at a hospital shortly after 
the earlymorning shooting the second was pronounced dead about 
noon 
both of the officers had head wounds very serious head wounds 
as well as to the arms and shoulders and about the tops of their 
bodies said fred taylor director of the metrodade police 
department 
the officers richard boles 41 and david strzalkowski 34 were 
shot a total of seven times apparently with their own weapons 
taylor said 
two counts of firstdegree murder were expected to be filed 
against charles harry street 34 of boynton beach said metrodade 
sgt russell fischer 
police said street had called an ambulance after reportedly 
suffering stomach pains he then declined to go to the hospital and 
emergency medical technicians and police left the scene 
about an hour later boles and strzalkowski were dispatched when 
street was spotted throwing rocks at homes in a nearby trailer park 
and at passing cars he eventually picked up what appeared to be a 
pipe and residents chased him out of the trailer park police said 
we think they were charged by someone with a pipe and then he 
got rid of the pipe and they had to fight by hand and thats when 
they lost the guns taylor said 
after the shooting police charged street sped away in a patrol 
car abandoned it in the neighboring broward county community of 
hollywood and stole a car there from a woman at gunpoint 
broward deputies were alerted by radio and two officers on 
patrol saw the man in the street about an hour later said broward 
sheriffs spokesman george crolius 
they approached to try to find out what was going on and at 
that point the suspect dropped the gun and said to the deputy 
dont shoot me crolius said 
street was taken to jail and later transferred to metrodade 
police custody 
street had served eight years of a 15year sentence for an 
attempted murder in palm beach county said fischer who did not 
have additional details of the conviction fischer also said street 
has a police record over 20 pages long dating from 1972 including 
assaults and other violent crimes

the un lawyer said monday the united 
states has no legal basis for denying a visa to plo chief yasser 
arafat who sought to come to new york to address the general 
assembly on palestine 
un lawyer carlaugust fleischhauer said the state department 
was relying on a paragraph congress added to the 1947 headquarters 
agreement in which america agreed to be the host country for the 
world body 
section 11 of the agreement says local state and us 
authorities must not impede the travel of un diplomats or 
representatives of nongovernmental organizations recognized by 
the unied nations for the purpose of consultation 
the palestine liberation organization has nonvoting observer 
status at the world body and represents the interests of 
palestinians in all debate on the middle east 
the headquarters agreement makes it clear that there is an 
unrestricted right of the persons mentioned in section 11 to enter 
the us for the purpose of proceeding to the headquarters 
fleischhauer said 
on saturday the state department said the agreement obligates 
the united states to provide entry transit and residence to guests 
of the united nations 
it relied on the us congress additional paragraph in denying a 
visa to arafat who the state department said knows of condones 
and lends support to acts of terrorism it claimed were perpetrated 
by the plo 
congress added the paragraph in 1947 upon us ratification 
after the state department and the united nations signed the treaty 
in 1946 
the clause in us law however seems aimed at restricting the 
movements of aliens regarded as security risks and does not appear 
to apply to a brief visit by an invited guest of the united nations 
it specifically exempts un headquarters the immediate 
neighborhood and travel to and from the headquarters from 
interference by us authorities on the basis of national security 
the key wording of the clause which is in the us law but not 
in the headquarters agreement reads 
nothing in the agreement shall be construed as in any way 
diminishing abridging or weakening the right of the united states 
to safeguard its own security and completely to control the entrance 
of aliens into any territory of the united states other than the 
headquarters district and its immediate vicinity and such areas 
as it is reasonably necessary to traverse in transit between the 
same and foreign countries 
the state department on saturday merely cited its interest 
under us law in barring aliens invited by the united nations in 
order to safeguard its own security 
it did not quote the passages that specifically exempt brief 
visits by leaders such as arafat 
particia m byrne the thirdranking ambassador at the us 
mission to the united nations said the united states disagreed with 
fleischhauers assessment but offered no evidence to support the 
american position

both new york democrats and both former congresswomen were among 
those protesting while shamir met with the leaders of the 
ultraorthodox political parties who are pushing for the stricter 
israeli immigration law 
the proposed law would outlaw nonorthodox conversions to judaism 
in israel and has outraged many american jews most of whom belong 
to the faiths reform and convervative movements the ultraorthodox 
parties have demanded the change as a price for joining a coaltion 
government with shamirs likud bloc

outside his office feminist protesters from more than 20 nations 
waved signs listened to speeches and chanted women say dont 
change the law 
this has no business on the political agenda said abzug 
this has no business when you have an important crisis in the 
country and youre trying to put together a coalition 
abzug was referring to the nearly yearlong palestinian uprising 
in the israelioccupied territories and the efforts of likud which 
narrowly won the most seats in parliament in the nov 1 election to 
forge a coalition government 
holtzman argued against the israeli governments view that a 
change in the law is an internal matter 
israel has asked me many times in the united states to act in 
the congress to provide money to speak out on behalf of israel 
she said 
they want all of us to come here and yet on the other hand 
they thumb their noses now with this proposed amendment 
abzug and holtzman were in the country as part of a fourday 
international jewish feminist conference 
leaders of the bnai brith met with shamir shortly after the 
protest to voice their concern 
israel is the centrality of our religion whether we are 
reform conservative or orthodox and we want to keep that feeling 
alive said seymour reich president of bnai brith 
international if the law changes the feeling might be 
diminished 
reich said bnai briths 500000 members in 41 countries were 
united in their opposition to the amendment he said the american 
jewish community is likely to reduce its finiancial contributions to 
israel if the law is passed 
morris abram president of the conference of presidents of major 
american jewish organizations said i dont believe that those who 
proposed a change in the law recognize the depth of feeling felt by 
many nonorthodox jews toward this law which they feel excludes 
them

the socialist government is ordering out army trucks 
to carry suburban commuters stranded by a transit strike transport 
minister michel delebarre announced on national television monday 
delebarre accused the communistled general confederation of 
labor cgt frances largest union and the one which called the 
strike of waging a sort of union guerrilla warfare of harassment 
this is not in the french union tradition 
he said that besides paralyzing two lines of the regional express 
rail network on monday striking transit workers blocked buses in 
their terminals and flattened tires and sabotaged engines 
he said management of the paris regional transit agency will be 
directed to stop paying strikers salaries and to start disciplinary 
actions against those who broke labor laws 
more moderate unions have criticized cgt strike leadership but 
some members of other unions and nonunion members are taking part 
in the walkout 
transport ministry officials said it will be wednesday morning 
before the first 140 army trucks were available with eventually 400 
vehicles and 1000 soldiers to be put at the disposition of local 
authorities to assure transport 
the government of premier michel rocard has been unsettled by a 
wave of strikes by nurses postal employees government office 
workers and other public service employees in recent months but 
rocard insists that inflationary wage increases cannot be allowed 
socialist party spokesman jeanjacques queyranne said he wondered 
if the cgt really wants negotiations to succeed and does it want 
the disruption to increase and the conflict to continue 
cgt secretarygeneral henri krasucki dismissed as completely 
stupid suggestions that the strikes were intended to increase 
communist chances at the expense of the socialists in next springs 
municipal elections 
delebarre asked why would taking hundreds of thousands of 
riders hostage which is what has happened lead these riders to 
vote in the municipal elections for those who incited this kind of 
union guerrilla warfare 
cgt members have said they want safety improvements and 
acrosstheboard pay increases of 170 per month 
besides stopping two of the four lines of the regional express 
network the strike also affected some metro service with between 
67 and 85 percent of the normal number of trains running on five 
lines 
michel rousselot director general of the transit agency said on 
french tv no new negotiations were planned with the unions 
representing the workers 
the cgtled strike was to last at least through tuesday

community looking for drug runners and petty criminals and 
exchanged intense gunfire with traffickers hiding in the community

azevedo said six drug runners all under 25 years old were 
cornered and shot to death in a school which was closed at the 
time and two others were killed by gunfire in a nearby cemetery 
the action was part of a new local government policy of clearing 
out drug runners from outlying and hillside slums the rio 
shantytowns have become home to criminals who set their own law 
there and protect dwellers from routine crime critics accused 
police of allowing drug runners to set deep roots in the rio slums 
and also of cooperating with organized crime in some cases

a federal grand jury investigating ptl 
founder jim bakker and several of his former aides reconvened monday 
amid speculation that indictments could be returned as early as the 
end of the week 
its anybodys guess said bakkers attorney jim toms of 
hendersonville all we can do right now is sit around and wait 
i would think theyre not quite to that indictments but 
theyre not far from it he said theyre still taking 
testimony i guess we could all be surprised were certainly 
getting closer 
toms said earlier that he believes bakker will be indicted 
its a question of when he said and what the particular 
allegations will be 
the 23member grand jury went back to work monday morning 
hearing testimony from a number of ptl lifetime partners people 
who contributed money to the ministry in exchange for hotel lodging 
at heritage usa the christian theme park run by ptl 
bakker who resigned as ptl president in march 1987 after the 
revelation that he had a tryst with church secretary jessica hahn 
and paid her hush money has denied any criminal wrongdoing he has 
called the grand jury investigation a fishing expedition 
three months ago he predicted i dont think ill be indicted 
i never have if i am ill be shocked 
charles alexander the federal prosecutor handling the 
16monthold investigation wrote bakker and at least two of his 
former associates last month informing them that they were targets 
of the probe and inviting them to appear before the grand jury this 
week 
bakker declined the invitation but one of the others roe 
messner who was ptls chief builder under bakker indicated last 
week he might testify before the grand jury 
as of late monday however messner had not shown up at the 
federal courthouse in downtown charlotte where the special panel is 
conducting its investigation behind closed doors 
toms said the timing of the indictments depends on whether 
messner agrees to testify or not 
my feeling is that if he does testify it would eat up a good 
deal of time he said at this point i have not heard that he 
is not going to appear 
toms said he has had several telephone conversations with 
alexander and his expectation that bakker will be indicted is 
just my impression based on my experience and the conversations i 
think thats consistent with the kind of talk hes alexander given 
me 
toms speculated the indictments would be returned the week of 
dec 12 but he did not dismiss the possibility that they could come 
as early as this week 
bakker has been preaching at his new church new covenant church 
in charlotte

the us supreme court on monday let stand 
a north dakota law that the state has used to prosecute parents who 
educate their children at home without being certified as teachers 
north dakota is considered to have the strongest restrictions on 
home schooling and monday was the second time since 1985 the 
supreme court has rejected without comment an appeal of the issue 
but opponents saying the law violates their right to practice their 
religion freely said they remained hopeful of overturning the law 
eventually 
like with a lot of other movements it takes a while to get the 
right case into the court at the right time said the rev clinton 
birst executive director of the north dakota home school 
association there are plenty of opportunities to get other 
appeals there too 
in challenging the law lawrence and deborah anderson formerly 
of jamestown and mark and lynette dagley of mandan said they 
believe god gave them responsibility for their children including 
their education and that sending them to school away from home 
would violate their religious convictions 
mark dagley said he and his wife will continue teaching their 
five children at home despite the setback monday 
we made a decision a long time ago that we were going to obey 
god to the best of our ability he said we could be wrong but 
the way we understand what the bible teaches is that were supposed 
to do this whatever has happened hasnt changed our viewpoints 
at all 
the andersons were fined 1000 and the dagleys 500 for 
violating the states compulsory school attendance law 
the ruling shows it is not an unduly intrusive requirement to 
ask that they parents provide a certified teacher or be one 
themselves said state superintendent of public instruction wayne 
sanstead 
north dakota is the only state that requires a parent to be a 
certified teacher to educate a child at home said j michael smith 
vice president of the home school legal defense association based 
in great falls va 
iowa has a law requiring teacher certification in home schools 
but the state has stopped enforcing it for one year while 
legislation is being considered to lift the requirement he said 
most states require parents who wish to teach their children at 
home to notify state officials about those plans smith said 
students progress is then monitored through standardized tests or 
independent evaluations he said 
most states have recognized the right of parents to teach their 
children and what they have done is judged the product smith 
said how you get there is irrelevant 
smith said the us supreme court may have refused to hear 
appeals of criminal convictions stemming from north dakotas 
compulsory attendance law because the issue affects so few people 
north dakota is an aberration he said 
at least 100 families are conducting illegal home schools in 
north dakota and 17 families have been prosecuted in the past five 
years birst said 
fifteen home schools are operating with state approval according 
to the state department of public instruction 
the andersons moved to eau claire wis in part because of the 
home school controversy in north dakota and also for employment 
reasons the parents teach their children at home in wisconsin 
birst said 
the north dakota supreme court upheld the compulsory attendance 
law last june ruling the states compelling interest in the 
education of children permits some restriction on the free 
exercise of religion 
the only question is whether or not the state has chosen the 
least restrictive alternative to achieve its compelling interest 
the state court said 
it said north dakota could choose another system such as 
authorizing visits to homes by state officials and monitoring the 
childrens educational process but the court said that alternative 
might mean a more intrusive role for the state in supervising the 
religious training of children 
after the 1987 legislature refused to change the compulsory 
attendance law a committee of leaders in education religion and 
law appointed by attorney general nicholas spaeth failed to reach 
a compromise in the longstanding dispute to recommend to the 1989 
legislature

president saddam hussein of iraq on monday 
made his first visit to egypt since taking office nine years ago for 
talks with president hosni mubarak on palestinian problems 
both leaders asked the united states to reconsider its decision 
saturday to bar yasser arafat chairman of the palestine liberation 
organization from entering the country to address the united 
nations in new york 
hussein said he was surprised by this narrowminded attitude 
from a superpower such as the united states which contradicts its 
commitments to the united nations according to the middle east 
news agency 
the agency said hussein expressed hope that washington would 
revise its action because this decision represents an offense not 
only to arafat but also to all arabs and the whole world 
mubarak made a similar appeal to the united states earlier in the 
day 
arafat going to the united nations would not cause problems for 
the united states mubarak said i think the united states 
should have encourged this step because it is an important step by 
the palestinians 
hussein told reporters at cairo international airport his visit 
to egypt was to discuss all matters of common concern to the two 
countries and the arab world in political economic and other 
fields with top priority going to the palestinian question 
according to the middle east news agency 
egypt and iraq announced sunday that their foreign ministers had 
canceled plans to go to the un for the debate on palestinian 
issues set to open dec 1 
after meeting hussein for lunch mubarak told reporters they 
exchanged views on a number of issues including the iraniraq peace 
talks and the us rejection of arafat 
husseins 10hour visit to egypt was his first since taking 
office in 1979 mubarak has visited baghdad three times in the past 
two years 
iraq severed diplomatic ties with egypt in 1979 to protest its 
peace treaty with israel and resumed diplomatic relations in 
november 1987 
despite the diplomatic break egypt supplied iraq with nearly 2 
billion in arms during iraqs 8year war with iran a 
unnegotiated ceasefire went into effect aug 20

friend and foe alike criticized the united states on monday for 
denying plo chief yasser arafat a visa to address the un general 
assembly debate on the palestinian issue only israel supported the 
decision 
most said the denial announced saturday by secretary of state 
george p shultz violated provisions of the 1947 un headquarters 
agreement requiring the united states not to interfere with un 
business 
many said the us action countered what they described as the 
palestine liberation organizations move toward moderation with its 
declaration of palestinian independence nov 15 that also implicitly 
recognized israel 
arafat called us rejection of his application a sheer 
violation of international law 
why are they afraid that i speak to world public opinion and 
explain the new palestinian decisions he said to reporters in 
baghdad iraq 
not even britain americas staunchest ally in europe expressed 
approval friends asked washington to reconsider and some arab 
nations pressed for the debate to be held in geneva or vienna so 
arafat could attend 
a un official said arafat would be given a forum for addressing 
the general assembly but did not specify a location 
libyan leader moammar gadhafi urged arab leaders to sever 
relations with the united states 
his official news agency quoted a letter to arab kings and 
presidents as saying america has shown enough scorn towards the 
arab nation whenever she slaps our right cheek we turn the other 
one and therefore relations with america have become a shame 
in the face of every arab 
the statement issued by shultz said arafat was denied a visa 
because he was an accessory to terrorism committed by plo 
elements only israel welcomed it 
an israeli foreign ministry official said maybe now part of 
the world will have to reexamine the situation and take another 
look at the record of the plo its quite a bloody record 
canada formally conveyed its opposition to the us decision to 
both washington and the united nations external affairs minister 
joe clark said in a statement 
we believe there is merit in hearing mr arafats views in an 
international forum so that we and others can assess whether there 
has been any change in the plos position on the peace process in 
the middle east clark said 
gennady gerasimov spokesman for the soviet foreign ministry 
called the visa denial an unconstructive and illegal step he 
said it raises serious obstacles to peace in the middle east and 
is deterimental to un prestige and authority 
chinas official news agency xinhua said the united states has 
failed to live up to the expectations of the world community and 
its decision has cast a dark shadow on the new hope for ending the 
prolonged arabisraeli conflict a british foreign office 
spokesman said granting a visa was a matter for the united states 
to decide but britain would have liked to hear arafat confirm in 
new york that the plo favored a settlement based on un resolutions 
242 and 338 and that it had renounced terrorism 
the resolutions implicitly recognize israel and acceptance of 
them has been a us condition for us contacts with the plo 
declarations issued nov 15 by the palestine national council the 
plo legislature restricted plo attacks to military targets in 
israel and israelioccupied territories but did not specifically 
renounce terrorism 
west germany said the decision was a blow to peace friedhelm 
ost spokesman for chancellor helmut kohl said the universal 
task of the united nations and its function as a place for conflict 
arbitration was not considered 
other european nations criticizing washington included italy 
france the netherlands spain sweden norway denmark and finland 
australia a us ally also complained 
jacques delors president of the european economic communitys 
executive commission said in brussels he was surprised and 
disappointed he said he spoke as a private citizen 
frances independent newspaper le monde said the decision was 
indefensible and swedens daily aftonbladet called it an 
appalling manifestation of imperialisti arrogance 
tunisia where the plo has its headquarters said refusing the 
visa hinders the work of the united nations as an instrument for 
bringing about peace and security in the world 
saudi arabias official news agency said the us decision did 
not harmonize with its principles of freedom justice and peace in 
the world the saudis are among the strongest us allies in the 
persian gulf region 
jordan and egypt two other arab states with ties to washington 
recommended moving the palestine debate to geneva 
president hosni mubarak of egypt said arafats going to the 
united nations would not cause problems for the united states i 
think the united states should have encouraged this step because it 
is an important step by the palestinians

a ban on overnight dormitory guests that set off an 
uproar at boston university was slightly relaxed monday but 
students still wont be able to play host to unrelated members of 
the opposite sex 
university president john silber announced he had accepted with 
minor modifications recommendations of a task force appointed to 
study the strict new rules after thousands of students demonstrated 
against the policy 
in his decision silber limited overnight guests of the opposite 
sex to family members visits between 11 pm and 1 am will have 
to be approved in writing by all roommates 24 hours in advance 
the university recognizes and welcomes the fact that college 
years are a time when young people change and mature in part 
through testing their increased freedom and increased responsibility 
for the conduct of their own lives 
but this testing must be carried out within the bounds of good 
manners silber wrote in a letter to the task force 
the recommendations arent substantially different than silbers 
original ban said student susheel srikonda who along with another 
student formed a group called active concerned together to fight 
the new policies 
the student group advocated a different approach that emphasized 
roommate approval and gave the resident assistants who are in charge 
of dormitories a larger role 
university spokesman kevin carleton said he believed the task 
forces recommendations were much more relaxed than the ban 
the initial policy that was proposed was that there be no 
overnight guests he said the tone of it was to discourage 
overnight guests this is saying that there certainly can be 
overnight guests it describes the format in which that can occur 
controversy over the rules which were announced in september 
was broadcast on national television after talkshow host phil 
donahue visited campus to talk to administration officials and 
student leaders 
on nov 21 the task force gave silber several recommendations 
including suggestions that overnight guests be allowed only at 
certain times in the semester a maximum of five times each semester 
and only with approval from all roommates 
silber said in his letter he limited overnight guests to family 
members out of consideration to parents who are in a proportion 
of about 30 to 1 opposed to overnight visitors of the opposite 
sex 
he conceded that the university cannot police dormitories 
rigorously but said the school is obliged to discourage certain 
behavior 
carleton said the new rules probably will go into effect next 
fall although some technical details remain to be worked out

signed a treaty on settling border issues 
chinese deputy foreign minister liu shuqing and mongolian first 
deputy foreign minister daramyn yundong signed the document it said 
relations between china and the mongolian peoples republic have 
been strained for years because of mongolias close ties with the 
soviet union and the presence of soviet troops in mongolia

a japanese department store bought pablo picassos 
acrobat and young harlequin for 3846 million monday night at 
christies the highest price ever paid at auction for a 20th 
century work of art 
the painting was purchased by the mitsukoshi department store 
store spokesman yasuhiro tanaka said in tokyo 
we bought the painting expecting to sell it to a private buyer 
here in tokyo tanaka said mitsukoshi a major importer of art 
has not yet decided on specific plans for the display or sale of the 
painting tanaka said 
a picture by the french impressionist claude monet the 
railroad bridge at argenteuil sold for 1255 million also 
joining the list of the 10 most expensive works of art sold at 
auction 
in june 28 another monet painting in the field sold at 
sothebys in london for 2490 million 
spokesmen for the auction house did not disclose the purchaser or 
the seller of the picasso painting they only identified the seller 
as a private owner 
the 1905 work from the artists rose period was sold in 3 
minutes bidding opened at 5 million pounds 92 million and ended 
at 209 million pounds 3846 million the price topped the 
previous record for a 20th century painting 2475 million paid for 
picassos maternity nov 14 in new york 
mondays auction of 60 works by 40 artists brought 5544 million 
pounds 10201 million a record for an impressionist and modern 
art sale in london individual records were set for works by 
picasso paul gauguin alberto giacometti paul klee and paul signac 
christies had offered 69 paintings for sale but nine were 
withdrawn or did not reach the minimums set by the owners 
after being shown in paris in 1905 acrobat and young 
harlequin found its way into a german museum and was confiscated 
by the nazis in 1937 as an example of decadent art they sold it at 
auction in switzerland to a belgian collector and it had been in 
private hands since 
japans imports of art and curios have ballooned in recent years 
as increasingly affluent japanese turn to collecting as a form of 
investment 
in march 1987 vincent van goghs sunflowers painted in 
1889 sold for 399 million at christies in london to yasuda fire 
and marine insurance co a japanese firm 
dealers estimate that at least 30 percent of worldwide art sales 
are to japanese buyers often large corporations that buy for 
taxfree investment purposes 
picasso did the painting in 1905 in his paris attic studio at 13 
rue ravignon using gouache an opaque watercolor easier to handle 
than oil paint 
auctioneer charles allsopp said the price paid for the painting 
was by no means exorbitant 
by any standard picasso was the towering figure of art in this 
century this picture was from his rose period which is usually 
considered his best and its the last great work of that series 
likely to come on the market allsopp said 
in the 27 years ive been here it has gripped more people and 
people with a greater variety of tastes than any previous picture 
it has had practically no detractors even among those who dont 
like picasso

saudi arabias proposal to lower the 
benchmark price of crude oil from 18 to 15 a barrel threatens a 
tentative accord aimed at reducing the world oil glut and driving up 
prices 
saudi arabias oil minister hisham nazer said late sunday the 
proposal was designed to prevent prices from falling below 15 but 
other ministers fear that a minimum price could become the ceiling 
price 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries currently 
maintains a benchmark of 18 a barrel but prices recently have been 
running at 14 or less 
each 1 rise in the price of crude oil theoretically means a 
pickup of 25 cents a gallon in retail gasoline prices although oil 
companies do not always pass along the full increase

japan has abused the worlds tropical forests in 
flagrantly wasteful ways and in the long run may upset the global 
ecological balance a group of environmentalists contend 
they also claim that with a recent shipment of banned giant raw 
logs from brazil japan has managed to open up the last major timber 
frontier latin america following the near depletion of forest 
land in africa and southeast asia 
japan is the largest importer of tropical hardwood and we 
consume the biggest amount said saburo okita chairman of the 
japan chapter of the world wide fund for nature known as the world 
wildlife fund in the united states canada and australia 
according to the international tropical timber organization 
japan imports 60 percent of the 421 million cubic feet of timber it 
uses annually 
some of the wood goes into disposable chopsticks and panels for 
pouredconcrete forms on construction projects yuta harago a 
wildlife fund consultant calls these wasteful uses for which 
alternatives can be found 
ten percent of japans industrial waste alone is made up of the 
discarded wood used for the paneling he said 
okita and fund officials spoke at news conferences marking the 
recent meeting in yokohama of the international tropical timber 
organization which groups countries that produce and consume timber 
okita a former foreign minister said japan overuses foreign 
timber because it was easily available at low prices during the 
reconstruction period after world war ii because of that the local 
timber industry ignores the forests covering 70 percent of the 
japanese islands okita added 
gordon shepherd of the world wildlife fund said the japanese 
forestry industry has limited cutting to try to sustain its supply 
of trees and so domestic hardwood is more expensive than imports 
most of the timber comes from southeast asia where some forests 
have been virtually stripped clean 
and africa is also in very bad shape said julio cesar 
centeno director of the latin american forestry institute in 
venezuela 
so the interest of the world trade is turning toward latin 
america because the forests are still there and the possibility of 
its exports are just beginning to show centeno said 
according to the wildlife fund latin america has 60 percent of 
the worlds tropical forests while its exports constitute only 5 
percent of the global trade 
many people agree that latin america is going to play a very 
important role in the tropical timber trade by the end of the 
century said centeno 
over the past few years several asian timber producing nations 
have banned the export of raw logs to let their forests recover in 
october brazil also announced it will prohibit the sale of the logs 
in answer to international criticism over the destruction of its 
amazon forests 
but in early november 386100 cubic feet of brazilian raw logs 
arrived in japan the result of a loophole in brazils ban said 
adam markham the wildlife funds campaigns officer 
the reason given for the imported logs is that the land is 
going to have to be cleared anyway because the forests will be 
flooded by hydroelectric dams he said with a special permit the 
brazilian timber industry was able to sell the logs to japan 
centeno said other countries in latin america will want to open 
up their forests because of unfair competition from brazil 
if you can get a special permit with this argument the dam 
project you can get another permit for expanding the agricultural 
frontier or the building of ranches or any other argument 
practically he added 
uprooting trees worldwide will eventually have very strong 
consequences on the environment centeno said 
there is discussion whether destruction of the forests will 
affect the temperature of the planet the winds rains it may have 
worldwide ecological damage he said 
motokatsu watanabe the foreign ministrys liaison officer with 
the international tropical timber organization said the private 
sector in japan has not seen the danger of deforestation 
a major goal for the government he said is to increase public 
awareness of environmental matters

dozens of tiny snail farms are popping up 
across britain and the growing interest in the new industry is 
threatening an escargot glut 
despite a lingering british prejudice against snails as mere 
garden pests consumption is growing at an estimated 10 to 20 
percent a year and a feud has already erupted over what constitutes 
an escargot 
on one side is a group led by a frenchman backing the helix 
snail the traditional favorite of france on the other are farmers 
championing the fastbreeding achatina snail which the french have 
recently deemed unfit to be called escargot 
the war is declared as far as the escargot is concerned says 
jacques aubree the frenchman whose british snail farmers 
association has enlisted 54 growers since 1986 to breed the helix 
snails he calls the aristocrat of escargot 
whats an escargot anyway its a snail retorts roy groves 
founder of the snail center a welshbased group that claims 300 
members worldwide including 40 british farmers breeding achatina 
indoors in pens 
aubree who tells visitors to his farm in rode near bath to 
tread carefully to avoid stepping on my profit believes the 
tropical achatina are less tasty than the helix he grows outdoors on 
pesticidefree land 
the french agree and passed a law in may forbidding achatina to 
be called escargot the intent was to stop unscrupulous 
restaurateurs from putting achatina meat in helix shells 
if people in britain are prepared to eat slugs in fancy shells 
i dont care said aubree a former chef speaking of the 
achatinas larger shells 
says groves we dont have preconceived ideas in this country 
the achatina is an excellent edible snail 
he notes that his snails can be harvested more quickly than the 
helix breed although they sell for 160 pounds 290 a pound 
compared with 230 pounds 415 a pound for helix 
the national farmers union estimates annual british consumption 
at 90 tons at most compared with 10000 to 12000 tons in france 
the worlds no 1 consumer which imports half its supply mainly 
from greece the soviet union turkey and eastern europe 
there is no doubt that in the majority of british peoples 
minds its still that lump of rubber served in garlic butter 
said charles wells whose 72member cooperative britsnail was 
founded this year to sell both achatina and helix snails 
it will take time to establish the snail he added i think 
if the industry is going to go ahead it has to consolidate 
i say look gentlemen forget your differences we are trying 
to produce a british crop like sheep and goats and anything else 
he said 
with the national farmers union estimating that each farmer 
could produce six tons a year of helix and 15 tons of achatina 
officials worry about how many more snail farmers britain can handle 
there is room for expansion but were very chary about 
encouraging people in joining an industry so embryonic said an 
official of the governments agriculture development and advisory 
service speaking on condition of anonymity 
the farmers union says it is worried about a snail surplus that 
would lower prices and quality 
still snail farmers like judy candy a helixgrower in aubrees 
cooperative believe their product has a future 
the candys who saw snails as a way to branch out from dairy cows 
and corn on their farm near bristol havent sold any snails but are 
optimistic 
theyre restful she said its a bit like tropical fish 
you cant really get annoyed with a snail they dont rampage 
about and knock things over

ban bullfighting in spain its as if 
someone wanted to ban baseball in the united states 
but a group of spaniards nevertheless wants to put an end to 
what it sees as cruelty in the bullring 
the spanish animal rights association and several european 
parliament deputies have launched a europewide petition drive 
calling on governments to adopt legislation that would ban 
bullfighting in spain and france and fox hunting in britain france 
and ireland 
the petition which organizers say would carry half a million 
signatures is to be given to prime minister felipe gonzalez of 
spain in january in brussels belgium shortly after spain assumes 
the rotating presidency of the european economic community for the 
first time 
while organizers want animal protection legislation passed in all 
12 eec member states the petition is aimed specifically at ending 
or modernizing bullfighting in spain and doing away with the 
torturing or killing of animals during many traditional religious 
festivals around the country 
making bullfighting modern or acceptable to opponents would 
involve eliminating the picadors on horseback who lance the bull to 
weaken its neck muscles so its head goes down the banderilleros who 
spike the animals neck muscles with three pairs of long darts and 
the final act the moment of truth when the matador stabs the 
bull between the shoulder blades and through the heart 
in neighboring portugal the bull is picked lightly by a 
bullfighter on horseback then grabbed by the tail by a group of men 
called forcados and wrestled around until it is dazed the bull 
does not die in the ring but is slaughtered shortly afterward in 
packinghouse fashion 
the proposed legislation would also eliminate the use of horses 
during bullfights prohibit young people from attending and force 
televised fights into a latenight time slot when children are in 
bed 
carlos briones a spokesman for the ministry of interior which 
oversees bullfighting said the government had no official comment 
on the subject 
but briones said he personally feels bullfighting is part of 
spanish culture and should be maintained 
bullfighting is considered an art rather than a sport in spain 
this past season 23 million people attended bullfights in spain 
3 million more than 1987 the capitals of 49 of spains 52 provinces 
have permament bullrings and during the summer months portable 
rings are set up in thousands of towns and villages for their annual 
fiestas 
the number of major fights rose 11 percent this year to 566 the 
highest number in the past decade 
a firstclass bullfighter earns from 27000 to 35000 to fight 
three bulls in an afternoon during the big fiestas in madrid 
seville bilbao pamplona zaragoza malaga and valencia 
spains leading bullfighter of the moment espartaco fought 82 
corridas threebull afternoons during the past season 
bullfighting and animal sacrifice in religious festivals are 
centuriesold traditions in spain dona mercedes de borbon the 
mother of king juan carlos is an avid bullfight aficionada and the 
king occasionally makes an appearance at madrids las ventas ring 
the worlds largest 
last year the government of the autonomous region of catalonia in 
northeastern spain banned the torturing and sacrificing of animals 
in religious festivals but still permits bullfighting 
the spanish animal rights association an organization of 2000 
members and 8000 contributors says spain is the only eec country 
that does not consider mistreatment of animals a criminal offense 
the associations vice president consuelo polo said there has 
been a resurgence of ritualistic street festivals since the death in 
1975 of gen francisco franco who banned animal taunting and 
sacrifice connected with them during his 36 years of authoritarian 
rule 
they dont think its a fiesta unless they have bulls running 
through the streets she said 
on most sundays during the bullfighting season march to october 
association members stand outside bullrings at madrids prado 
museum and on the southern costa del sol beaches handing out 
literature in an effort to discourage tourists from attending 
bullfights 
but pedro geraldo a bullfighter for 14 years says spaniards not 
only respect the bullfighters but the bull for its courage and 
beauty 
its an art that is sometimes misunderstood by foreigners he 
said

the greatest financial gift that most young 
people could receive is a lesson in how persistence and consistency 
can lead to enormous rewards in the stock market 
alas the course laid out is seldom followed the route chosen is 
often a bumpy one shortcuts lead to dead ends and detours that 
dissipate both the funds and a sense of the original goal 
but in theory if not in practice the route is a simple one of 
investing reinvesting dividends as they are earned and waiting 
a common stock investment of 1000 made at the end of 1925 for 
example would have grown to more than 375000 at the end of 1987 
if left alone that same 1000 invested in small company stocks 
would have reached 145 million 
these calculations were made by gerald perritt a mathematician 
and chairman of the chicagobased advisory firm investment 
information services in the first instance the annual return was a 
nominal 99 percent in the second the smaller company stocks would 
have returned 121 percent 
you can be certain however that few if any individuals ever 
followed that simple route for the length of time required 
dividends would have been spent rather than reinvested fundn 62 years 
and in real terms it lost 60 percent of 
its purchasing power 
it is a lesson for all ages if you are 20 years old you should 
keep it in mind for your own retirement if you are 65 put some 
money away for your grandchildren and greatgrandchildren 
and tie it up in a handsoff trust

president alfredo stroessner a stocky 
vigorous man of robust health and immense appetite for his job 
walked out of the national palace one friday in late august and was 
not seen again in public for two weeks 
the absence was without precedent since stroessner took power by 
coup 34 years ago and was unexplained to paraguayans accustomed to 
seeing him virtually every day on television or the front page of 
patria the newspaper of the ruling colorado party 
what happened was that the 76yearold stroessner who 
according to government propaganda never gets sick never takes 
vacations and spends part of almost every day on the job underwent 
a prostate operation 
to this day that has not been publicly reported to paraguays 4 
million people many officials wont speak of it even privately 
holding to the government version that stroessner had a routine 
medical checkup and is fine 
we asked him why dont we issue an official bulletin saying 
you had a prostate operation martin chiola vice president of 
the colorado party said in an interview 
he said stroessner refused on grounds that his health was his own 
affair 
opponents hold however that stroessners health is a public 
issue because it affects his capacity to rule and they dont 
believe he is well 
he no longer arrives for work just after sunrise and leaves 
before noon he receives fewer people than before and passes on to 
his aides the work he used to do himself those who have seen him 
says he walks and speaks slowly and looks pallid 
for television they only let the photographers take pictures 
from far away and at an angle said aldo zuccolillo owner of the 
newspaper abc color which was closed by the government in 1984 a 
year ago the pictures were in clear focus 
he has aged visibly he has lost his force said roman 
catholic bishop mario melanio medina an outspoken critic of the 
regime there is a feeling that he wont be around for long 
rumors swept this sleepy steamy capital the first week of 
september that he had died many were left dumbstruck 
it demonstrated his fallibility said domingo laino leader 
of the authentic radical liberal party a group denied formal 
recognition by the government but which may be paraguays largest 
opposition group it pushed people to think poststroessner 
colorados chiola who also is vice president of the chamber of 
deputies in the congress acknowleged as much in an interview in his 
office at the legislative palace 
nobody in the country thought he could get sick said chiola 
now people are thinking that at some point there will have to be 
a succession 
stroessners seizure of power in 1954 ended a 22year period of 
anarchy and misrule in which paraguay suffered a war with bolivia a 
civil war and a dozen presidents 
for more than three decades he has provided stability if not 
social peace to a country that since independence from spain in 
1811 almost never has had free elections independent political 
institutions or fair party competition 
laino a former congressional deputy who has been imprisoned and 
exiled and others see stroessner in decline they are pressing for 
a transition to a representative government in which they can 
participate 
the roman catholic church to which the majority of paraguayans 
nominally belong advocates constitutional reform an amnesty of 
political prisoners a crackdown on contraband and corruption a 
raise in the minimum wage equal rights for women 
theres grumbling even within the colorado party which claims a 
membership of 14 million students at the national university are 
joining dissident organizations and party regulars are split 
between militants who unswervingly back stroessner and 
traditionalists who do not 
the colorado party has abandoned many of its flags unions 
farmers and turned into a massive bureaucracy claimed leandro 
prieto yegros a colorado member of congress 
edgar insfran stroessners interior minister in 195666 said 
stroessner has lost a lot of support within the past few years he 
is seen as excessively authoritarian in a way that cannot continue 
militant colorados talk little of transition they are 
willing to wait knowing that their constitutional twothirds 
control of congress will allow them to choose stroessners 
successor if he cannot continue in office 
there is no open challenger to stroessner and no apparent 
fissures in the military the real power in paraguay 
the opposition seems hopelessly fractured and incapable of 
uniting behind a single candidate or group 
prieto yegros describes the opposition as infants and 
crazies and dismisses them as a credible force 
in politics nobody gives anything for nothing he said 
people who cant even organize themselves wont participate in any 
transition 
abc color owner zuccolillo agrees his colleagues at the moment 
cannot back up their demands for change 
the poststroessner process is going to begin only after he 
dies zuccolillo said hes going to die in power either as 
president of the republic or commanderinchief of the armed forces 
there is nothing that will stop that 
the presidential press secretary juan jose benitez rickman says 
he sees no reason to doubt stroessner will complete his term of 
office which runs through 1993 
asked about stroessners health benitez rickman would only point 
to a copy of a letter stroessner signed recently with his signature 
that looks like a capital h 
look his hand doesnt tremble he said it shows firmness 
and authority president stroessner is in perfect health and thanks 
be to god for that

says platt you cant find someone in the hospital who doesnt 
think about it frequently 
this doesnt mean that people with aids receive poor care from 
quaking doctors and nurses while some surgeons are reluctant to 
operate and some nurses may try to minimize contact experts say 
there are plenty of others who selflessly put aside their 
apprehensions at many hospitals teams of doctors and nurses have 
evolved who are intensely protective of their aids patients 
treating them with compassion and skill 
often the most timid are those who have perhaps by choice the 
least direct contact with the disease dr deborah cotton of beth 
israel hospital in boston says the intensity of this fear is often 
out of proportion to the risk of catching it 
as a group health care workers are probably no more or less 
fearful than the general public and thats of great concern she 
says they should clearly be less fearful they have more 
information 
reasonable caution in the hospital makes sense ordinary contact 
with infected people is safe but doctors and nurses can catch the 
virus if infected blood mingles with their own entering their 
bodies through a cut or a needle jab the risk is probably highest 
in the operating room the emergency room and the delivery room the 
bloodiest places in the hospital 
according to dr julie gerberding of san francisco general 23 
cases of probable onthejob infection of health care workers have 
been reported around the world although there undoubtedly are other 
cases that havent come to public attention they are 14 nurses six 
lab workers one nonsurgical physician one dentist and one home 
health care provider all had direct contact with aidsinfected 
blood most often accidental needle sticks 
the virus is hard to catch even when jabbed by a needle covered 
with infected blood the odds of infection are longer than 1 in 200 
however jabs and cuts are common especially in the operating room 
according to one estimate emergency department surgeons who operate 
on lots of infected people may have a 2 percent annual risk of 
catching the aids virus while working 
outright refusal to treat infected people is rare although it 
does happen 
its hard to go near a teaching hospital in the united states 
where somebody who treats persons with aids has not had somebody 
refuse or hesitate to do an invasive procedure says daniel fox 
who teaches humanities in medicine at the state university of new 
york in stony brook 
it is more than an understandable reluctance to get sick and die 
several doctors say it is a reluctance to get sick and die for 
people that physicians dont like 
we associate the aids epidemic with drug abusers and 
homosexuals says silverman in the back of your mind you say 
im not going to die for this 
there are strong ethical taboos against refusing to treat someone 
solely out of fear of catching his disease but doctors may safely 
hide behind another shield simple ignorance some experts say that 
many primary care physicians have failed to learn about aids so they 
can refer infected people elsewhere they can say quite honestly 
that they are not competent to treat their condition 
if it was some other disease would physicians become more 
rapidly informed about it asked dr james noble of new england 
medical center i think that a lot of what the patients perceive 
as rejection at a very vulnerable time in their lives is more 
reluctance on the part of doctors to get involved than it is 
outright hostility toward them although that occurs also 
many physicians complain that surgeons are more likely to say 
that operations are unnecessary if patients are infected at 
hospitals with large numbers of aids patients aids referral 
networks have grown up internists send their patients to surgeons 
radiologists and other specialists who they know will take their 
patients without quibbling 
one of the few people to study these attitudes is dr r nathan 
link an internist at bellevue hospital center in new york he 
surveyed interns and residents at two new york hospitals and found 
that about 40 percent reported moderate or major concern about 
getting aids from their patients a quarter say that if given a 
choice they would not take care of people with the disease 
by far the biggest issue was fear of contagion to 
themselves says link thats human nature above all else 
youre worried about your own hide

when surgeons reach into patients incisions many 
of them want to know if they are dipping their hands in 
aidsinfected blood 
doctors and nurses frequently worry about catching aids from 
their patients but the concern is probably nowhere deeper than in 
the operating room 
surgeons frequently cut and puncture their fingers knives and 
fine thread effortlessly slice through latex gloves their only 
protection 
talk to cardiac surgeons whose hands are often in blood says 
dr sheldon wolff an infectious disease expert at new england 
medical center they often nick themselves and yeah it bothers 
the hell out of them its easy to say youve taken an oath that 
says youve got to operate on everybody but these guys are putting 
themselves at risk and they make cogent arguments for wanting to 
know the status of the patient in terms of hiv infection 
infectious disease specialists such as wolff urge surgeons to 
assume that every patient is infected and take all possible 
precautions with all of them 
they and many other nonsurgical physicians oppose broadbased 
aids screening of hospital patients they argue that results showing 
infection may be hard to keep secret and they could lead to 
discrimination even a refusal to perform an operation or other 
procedure 
there is also a minuscule chance that the test will fail to spot 
people who are infected so screening might encourage a misplaced 
sense of security 
surgeons respond that when a patient is infected they have a 
right to know it if they know they are operating on an infected 
patient they will be extra careful and take precautions that are 
impractical for all operations 
as a result some surgeons ask patients for permission to check 
their blood for the aids virus hiv before surgery 
in the operating room we have pump technicians circulators 
anesthesiologists scrub nurses says dr norman silverman of the 
university of illinois we are talking about a lot of people and a 
big investment in their future and education they have a right to 
know if the patient is positive or not youll be five times more 
careful and doubleglove wherever you stick your finger 
generally doctors ask permission before aids testing and in 
some states such approval is legally required some surgeons screen 
all patients while others check only homosexuals drug addicts or 
anyone else who might be at high risk of infection doctors say the 
patients rarely refuse 
i think its quite reasonable to ask a patient who is at some 
risk if he can be tested i think most of us do it says dr 
george sheldon of the university of north carolina there may be 
some patients you might ask even though they arent in a risk 
group if you have a reason that is more intuitive than factual 
some surgeons however oppose this use of the test for 
instance dr albert bothe of new england deaconess hospital says he 
thinks aids testing is justifiable only if it helps the patient not 
the doctor 
what about the patient who comes into the emergency room and 
you dont know bothe asked do you wait until the test is done 
what about patients who have the virus and their test was negative 
and then what different is the surgeon going to do 
none of the 23 victims of probable onthejob aids infection 
among health care workers reported so far is a surgeon whether any 
of the special precautions they take with infected patients will 
keep them from getting the virus is unclear among those frequently 
mentioned 
wear two pairs of gloves 
minimize passing sharp instruments between the surgeon and scrub 
nurse 
use automatic staplers rather than stitches 
cut with an electric cautery rather than a scalpel 
keep medical students out of the operating room 
make sure the operation is performed by a seasoned surgeon not 
an inexperienced resident who might be more likely to cut other 
people at the operating table

boston ap new hospital procedures intended to keep doctors 
and nurses from catching the aids virus are spelled out in an 
evolving series of recommendations known as universal 
precautions 
the rules are called universal because they are supposed to apply 
to all patients outwardly healthy people may harbor the virus in 
their blood so the new practices encourage hospital workers to 
treat all blood as though it is infected 
these precautions compiled by the us centers for disease 
control include 
gloves should be worn when touching patients mucous membranes 
nonintact skin and a variety of body fluids including blood 
semen vaginal secretions spinal fluid and amniotic fluid they 
should also be worn when handling items soiled with these fluids 
giving shots or drawing blood 
hands should be washed immediately after gloves are removed 
masks and protective glasses should be worn during procedures 
when blood may fly into health workers faces soakproof gowns or 
aprons should also be used if blood or other fluids are likely to be 
splattered 
health workers should be especially careful not to jab 
themselves with needles scalpels or other sharp instruments 
needles should not be recapped after they are used they should be 
put in punctureproof containers these containers should be 
conveniently placed around the hospital 
mouthpieces or resuscitation bags should be available to 
minimize the need for emergency mouthtomouth resuscitation

editors note when it comes to stamps millions of citizens 
seem to have ideas about what should go on them pressure and 
controversy can get pretty intense as in behalf of the elvis 
presley stamp thats why the committee that decides meets behind 
closed doors and never explains its reasoning for picking one 
subject over another

they are americas headstones its family 
albums 
stamps 
it used to be the us postal service would put george washington 
282 times or ben franklin 133 on its postage and hope they would 
stick 
but in the 2500plus stamps since the first washingtonfranklins 
of 1847 postage has become more than just glued paper todays 
stamps are colorful as rainbows varied as flea markets and one of 
the most exclusive portrait galleries in the world 
every year some 2530000 native sons bypassed heroes worthy 
causes deserving luminaries memorable landscapes and happy 
birthdays are proposed for a stamp only 25 or 30 make it 
once upon a time franklin delano roosevelt a collector would 
call up postmaster general jim farley with an idea and tell him to 
get printing today in the course of human events a committee 
decides 
who how what when where 
its about as democratic a process as we have going says 
dickey rustin manager for stamp information at the postal service 
the deciders appointed by the postal commissioners for the last 
30 years are the 13 members of the citizens stamp advisory 
committee they meet here six times a year to decide by majority 
vote whom you will be sticking your tongue out at on the way to the 
post office 
the decisions tend to be upbeat wyatt earp stands a better 
chance of being postally canonized than billy the kid jesse james 
was proposed and turned down so was a pretzel with beerflavored 
glue it helps to be good looking weve had cardinals and bald 
eagles and poinsettias no turkey buzzards 
beyond the certitude that there will always be a stamp in 
circulation showing the american flag 54 times it is difficult to 
make book on who will make the postal hall of fame 
consider 
we have had abraham lincoln but not jefferson davis babe ruth 
but not roger maris lewis and clark but not zebulon pike crazy 
horse but not george armstrong custer canada but not japanese 
cherry trees paddy wagons but not bonnie and clyde mary cassatt 
but not jackson pollack john harvard but not elihu yale jack 
london but not irving berlin jack in the pulpit but not skunk 
cabbage a frank lloyd wright house but not an outhouse proposed 
and flushed nobelists sinclair lewis william faulkner and john 
steinbeck but not nobelist ernest hemingway duke ellington but not 
king louis armstrong hoover herbert but not hoover j edgar 
feeding the hungry but not fat farms 
conversely or perversely we have had population control and 
baby carriages mexican independence and the battle of san jacinto 
one might surmise that custer and jeff davis are in limbo because 
they lost hemingway because he took his own life maris because of 
his asterisk youll never know because the committee doesnt 
publicly explain its reasoning 
when john harvard was stamped in 1986 to celebrate his namesake 
universitys 350th birthday that opened the door for yalies and 
loyal sons and daughters of leland stanford sophia smith johns 
hopkins lord jeffrey amherst and col ephraim williams et al to 
demand equal billing to cool hot potatoes the post office will not 
henceforth immortalize college founders 
better news for others satchmo may make it because the post 
office issues a stamp every year honoring the nations black 
heritage the outhouse probably wont because as rustin says 
stamps are the nations calling cards irving berlin probably 
will get there but hes not dead yet you have to be entombed for 
at least 10 years to qualify unless youre a president theyre 
eligible one year after their first posthumous birthday 
we believe someone has to stand the test of time rustin 
explains 
love has apparently met that standard the annual love stamp 
sells swak a smashing one billion per issue 
the advisory committee is as are the stamps they select a cross 
section three are historians one publishes a graphic arts 
magazine an executive of general motors is a stamp collector 
digger phelps a collector and notre dame basketball coach is a 
member so is belmont fairies former editor of the canceled 
washington star tv executive jack rosenthal and dr douglas lewis 
director of sculpture at the national art gallery 
when the committee meets rustin and his staff present the 
proposals that have flooded in over the transom from a stampminded 
citizenry each has had a modicum of research some proposals are 
obvious columbus stumbled upon the new world 500 years ago in 1992 
world war ii for us involvement will be 50 years old starting in 
1991 dday seems a likely choice japanese bombers over pearl 
harbor dont 
we get into some things controversial says rustin but we 
dont want to reflect badly on the us we dont build a fire thats 
not going to warm us 
there was a 1981 stamp for instance that said alcoholismyou 
can beat it would the recipient think there was a hidden message 
beyond the one in the envelope 
the committees closed door discussions can get heated over 
social concerns or a nominees worthiness some proposals have 
waited 40 years in the bullpen before making it to stampdom if the 
committee remains undecided it may ask rustin for further research 
some proposals are accompanied by petitions we neither 
encourage nor discourage them says rustin the commission allows 
no lobbying before it and doesnt credit any proposal 
we dont want to get into who was first

the post office sold about 38 billion stamps last year for 
10743000000 its employees process through dark of night and 
mean dogs about half of the worlds postal volume the majority of 
it is metered although there is a trend back to stamps business 
surveys show people are more apt to open a stamped envelope 
three years ago thenpostmaster general paul carlin declared 
america should beautify its postage actually the post office 
started getting away from the bluegrayrose eminences of 
washingtons and franklins and jeffersons in the late 1950s with 
brighter colors and pleasing graphics some think the united states 
is closing fast on the consensus world leaders in pretty postage 
japan and sweden 
stamps divide into definitive and commemorative categories the 
definitives portray national landmarks human and geographic and 
are the every day stamps for all denominations from a penny to 875 
for express mail the biggest and most expensive when they run out 
they are reprinted 
commemoratives are oneshot editions of 120 to 160 million 
stamps they honor everything from navaho blankets to cigar store 
indians abigail adams to babe zaharias blue fin tuna to boy 
scouts appaloosa horses to zlp codes hot air balloons to certified 
public accountants 
commemoratives are what the nations 19 million stamp collectors 
stick in their albums collectors provided a 157 million profit in 
1987 for the post office whose stamps incidentally are not tax 
supported by law they pay their way since all stamps are changed 
every time there is a postal increase collecting is a growth 
industry 
collectors like colors as does the general public and things 
more than people they are kept coming back by continuing series 
such as transportation iceboats stutz bearcats pushcarts blacks 
sojourner truth roberto clemente scott joplln and the arts 
herman melville ts eliot enrico caruso 
size restricts what gets on a stamp what does an artist do about 
rivets in a commemorative of the usrussian space linkup how do 
you reduce an abstract concept like separation of church and state 
to the size of a postage stamp if you can get a social problem on a 
stamp will anyone buy it 
take cpas not notorious for color or sex appeal artist lou 
nolan created a stunning design last year of an ink penpoint 
diagonally intersecting the corner of a ledger sheet clever pretty 
nolan is one of hundreds of artists who design stamps the 
advisory committee has four design coordinators one is art 
director for the national geographic magazine who farm out an 
approved proposal to three or so artists the winner gets an average 
of 3000 this is peanuts compared to what a duck stamp designer 
can get the post office atones for its parsimony by giving the 
artist what all need and few get publicity 
leafing through the post office guide to its stamps is an amble 
through changing times a confederate didnt make the postage until 
1936 when robert e lee and stonewall jackson showed up on a 
4center a 20cent postal rider in 1869 was the first nonpresident 
besides franklin who was famous if for nothing else by making a 
profit as colonial postmaster the riders horse was the first 
nonhuman when columbus the first foreigner landed upside down by 
printing error in the bahamas in an 1869 issue the 14cent stamp 
became an instant rarity now worth some 145000 
the famous inverted jenny on an airmail stamp of 1918 now fetches 
some 11499976 more than its 24cent face value queen isabella 
who sent columbus over here was the first woman 1893 an unnamed 
chief the first indian 1923 booker t washington the first black 
1940 
because perfection is a goal and not a commonplace reality even 
among printers airplanes can always land upside down on a stamp to 
the delight of collectors and the embarrassment of the post office 
there was an engraver who etched an infinitesimal star of david in 
the beard of a 1986 stamp of bernard revel founder of yeshiva 
university in new york but he got into a lot of trouble for it 
once a stamp has been designed and approved it goes to the 
bureau of printing and engraving it can come out in rolls booklets 
or panels all glued by an adhesive that must be approved by the 
food and drug administration the post office is working on a new 
stickum 
although it takes up to three years to get a stamp to market 
theres no telling if it will take a licking 
if the public doesnt like a stamp we know about it rustin 
says many people just take whats handed them but the more 
discriminatory favorites are history and color take pen in hand 
and write stamped to washington to express displeasure the post 
office does market surveys but theres no sure thing in stamps 
there was a 1984 christmas stamp of a santa claus drawn by a 
schoolboy winner of a nationwide competition among young pupils 
cute as it was it bombed 
we wont be doing that again says rustin less certain is 
what the post office is going to do about elvis hes been 
officially dead despite alleged sightings of a postmortem road 
show for more than the requisite decade he certainly was an 
american and his fandom is clamoring for a presley stamp a radio 
station in boston got 10000signatures on a petition rustin figures 
hes been on at least 100 radio stations to discuss postalizing the 
rock hero 
the advisory committee of course will not be lobbied rustin 
their spokesman firmly bars the door to the committee room 
some people have trouble with the way he died he says 
tactfully 
and to those who have trouble even believing that elvis is dead 
it can only be reported that the man whose hips set a nation 
twisting is like 30000 or so of his fellow citizens national 
monuments and assorted memorabilia under consideration

editors note four decades and one sexual revolution ago the 
first kinsey report on sexual behavior burst on a startled american 
public neither the findings nor the language in which it was 
presented would raise many eyebrows today meantime the kinsey 
institute for sex research carries on amid some internal 
controversy about aims and purposes 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
fifty years ago amid the limestone 
bastions and gargoyled turrets of indiana university a most 
unlikely man with a bow tie and a crew cut began a most unlikely 
study what goes on behind the bedroom door 
ten years later he published the first of two books on american 
sexual behavior that shook the american public to its primal roots 
and inventoried everything from infidelity to masturbation 
in retrospect alfred c kinsey was well suited to bring sexual 
behavior out of the confessional in dispassionate scientific terms 
quiet unassuming straight trustworthy dedicated a father of 
four a man of specifics an expert for instance in every aspect 
of the gall wasp in 1938 he was asked by a women students 
organization to give a course on love and marriage 
at the library he was dismayed to discover the lack of valid 
information a sign of the inhibited times so he began gathering 
data himself interviewing colleagues students even the campus 
police people confided in him 
his reports startled the american people and evoked attacks from 
church groups statisticians and sociologists the chicago tribune 
attacked him as a real menace to society the philadelphia 
bulletin killed its own reporters story newspapers from the san 
francisco news to the raleigh times from the rocky mountain news to 
the london daily express either refused to print or edited out 
offending passages in a day when newspapers did not use the words 
rape or syphillis the idea of using explicit references to sexual 
activities was unthinkable 
kinsey said that if the laws of the land were strictly enforced 
half of all white american males would be in jail as sex offenders 
between 50 and 85 percent of males engage in extramarital sex by 
the age of 40 nearly 40 percent of single males have engaged in 
some homosexual activity although they are not homosexuals 
the 1953 book on women found that 10 percent of married women 
never reach climax but 14 percent of women have multiple orgasms 
up to 20 an hour fifty percent of women have had premarital sex and 
26 percent of married women had extramarital sex 
kinseys institute for sex research today is headed by a woman 
dr june machover reinisch who once took dance lessons to become 
the gwen verdon of her generation sang with a group called the 
seagulls learned to sky dive earned a pilots license helped 
manage the romantic soul duo peaches and herb and the rock group sly 
and the family stone later she turned to the study of psychology 
and at age 38 an associate professor at rutgers she was offered 
the kinsey job 
she renamed the center the kinsey institute for research in sex 
gender and reproduction thereby redefining the goals of the 
institute 
if we could get back to biology wed find that the differences 
between the sexes are quite small she once told an interviewer 
i believe that many of the biological propensities are related to 
sensation and perception how we see things how we experience them 
life is a continual interraction eventually some of the 
original differences are highly magnified by experience and by 
complicated interactions between organism and environment while 
others are distorted beyond recognition or completely ignored 
she also began a thriceweekly column that appears in some 80 to 
100 newspapers answering questions about sex and reproduction 
she has named to the board of trustees david hendin senior vice 
president and editorial director of united feature syndicate and 
sherry hackett president of the ultimate experience of beverly 
hills calif which plans to open a new restaurant in santa monica 
she is the wife of comedian buddy hackett 
obviously they were not named to the board for their expertise 
in sex research hendin is publisher of the columns which is both a 
source of income and has been called an extension of the kinsey 
reports in modern dress sherry hackett has a knack for raising 
money she says she raised 250000 in her last project for the los 
angeles suicide prevention center and plans to have her first 
fundraiser for kinsey in the spring 
for all of this reinisch has stirred up a considerable furor 
which some say threatens her job and the reputation of the institute 
dr paul gebhard the former director who remained past 
retirement as director emeritus and consultant resigned sept 13 
with a pointed letter to reinisch 
i have become increasingly disappointed in recent years with 
the management of the institute he wrote he congratulated her on 
increasing the space the institute occupies in the universitys 
morrison hall and on remodeling the premises 
but he was critical of what he saw as neglect of the institutes 
library which has been called the worlds secondlargest repository 
of sexual publications erotica and pornography the largest being 
in the vatican he complained that the library staff had been cut 
threatening its value as an uptodate resource for scientists and 
clinicians 
frankly it pains me to see journal subscriptions cut and other 
austerity measures taken in the library while money is spent on 
carpets drapes brass lighting fixtures and similar 
nonessentials

reinischs assistant director stephanie sanders says the only 
money spent on remodeling was earmarked for that purpose by the 
university reinisch herself says she spent twice as much in 1987 on 
the library staff as gebhard did in his last year and more than four 
times as much on library acquisitions she says the remodeling goes 
in part to save the library where materials were endangered by water 
leaks climatecontrolled areas are being readied for the library 
volumes and a gallery is being set up for threedimensional art 
secondly gebhard complained in the past six years the 
institute has produced very little research he added 
i had hoped that you would attract several competent sex 
researchers as institute members or affiliates to undertake various 
projects under the aegis of the institute lastly you somehow 
missed the one major area of funding for sex research when the 
federal government was seeking grant proposals for survey research 
connected with aids numerous applications were received but i am 
told none came from the kinsey institute the very institute 
which became famous for its many survey research projects 
reinisch has pointed out that she serves on an advisory panel for 
a national survey going to 50000 american households to better 
define the aids problem and has applied for grants to study 
pregnant women and their offspring through the first year and a half 
of life her aims are more toward the biological her studies 
including one she had begun earlier involving 9000 pregnancies and 
their issue in denmark seek to establish a link between whatever 
barbituates and hormones the pregnant women took and the sexual 
orientation and gender of their children 
in addition her researchers interviewed a group of lesbians and 
among other findings discovered that many of them continued to have 
heterosexual relations in spite of their selflabels 
that led reinisch to suggest that early aids research may have 
been based on faulty historytaking which could have minimized the 
aids transmission by heterosexuals 
gebhard didnt think much of those projects and with his 
resignation severed any and all connections with the institute 
earlier reinisch had asked for and received one years extension 
on a regular fiveyear university review the release of which is 
now imminent and over the past year the institute received a spate 
of anonymous letters reinisch characterized as vicious and critical 
of her stewardship 
in midyear came the abrupt departure of the last three people on 
the library staff reassigned at their request to other campus 
libraries 
that sharply limited the institute librarys availability to 
scholars all 64000 volumes 3500 threedimensional objects and 
25000 pieces of flat art japanese indian persian and western 
drawings and paintings beyond that the library houses pornographic 
material from cartoons to stag films fetish objects prison art 
condoms letters diaries photographs the fantasies of 
generations current periodicals stack up with no one to file them 
what exactly is behind the unrest is unclear some say 
differences in style and some say shortcomings in substance there 
is no question that there are differences in style 
kinsey who poured every cent of profit from his studies back 
into the institute each hard cover copy of his books yielded a 
dollar in royalties a total of perhaps 500000 and who pressed 
his people to work on saturdays without overtime would be 
considered oldfashioned in his approach today when gebhard first 
moved in in 1946 he had to share a room with kinseys gall wasp 
specimens piled in boxes nearly floortoceiling 
kinsey was not a fundraiser he abhorred the socializing 
necessary what money became available went into expanding the 
research base and adding to the collection kinsey was a 
conservative in every aspect of life except sex research 
he survived congressional investigations in the communisthunting 
mccarthy era even when the rockefeller foundation mindful of a 
house committee investigation that sought to show that philanthropic 
organizations were encouraging research by communists cut off 
further grants to kinseys institute 
in 1957 kinsey with the university behind him faced down us 
customs in the courts over an attempt to stop the import of erotic 
materials for research purposes he did not live to see the landmark 
decision he died in 1956 at the age of 62 
kinseys aim was to build up a reservoir of at least 100000 
personal sex histories there were some 18000 when he quit the 
source material for the major studies on american sexual behavior 
and he hoped for future studies as well his notion was to have a 
large enough statistical base so that researchers could dip in at 
will to retrieve what they needed for any given study 
since kinsey masters and johnson and others have taken the sex 
act into the laboratory measuring scientifically everything from 
the physiology of the orgasm to the nature of impotency books like 
alex comforts the joy of sex are best sellers 
both gebhard and reinisch had plans to go back to kinseys 
original subjects and see how things had changed in the past 50 
years it was just too expensive everyone seems to agree but the 
subjects are still out there gebhard and reinisch agree between 50 
and 80 years of age 
reinisch says those she met thought that being interviewed by 
kinsey was one of the greatest experiences in their lives 
afterward they felt better about themselves

editors note despite what most people think the american 
public transit association recently cited the new york subway system 
as the most improved system on the continent and the man in charge 
received the manager of the year award and despite the way the 
subway is pictured on tv filmmakers are having a hard time finding 
the oncefamiliar graffiti sprayed on subway cars whats going on 
in new yorks underground 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

tune in the equalizer and see a young girl 
stalked by an attacker in a shadowy subway stop watch cagney amp 
lacey chase a suspect through a crowded train or a video dancer 
paint the name of michael jacksons album bad on the wall of a 
brooklyn station 
these images of the subway as a filthy bastion of thugs are 
powerful only 25 percent of americans surveyed thought the subways 
are safe and only one in three said they would use the underground 
when visiting new york 
but the subway is getting a bad rap according to transit 
authority officials they say determined management and a 12 
billion capital improvement program have resulted in a major success 
story of the 1980s the rebirth of the new york subway system as a 
relatively reliable clean and safe mode of transportation 
the turnaround and the elimination of graffiti from the subway 
system has been near miraculous says mayor edward i koch 
officials say subway reliability is five times better than it was 
five years ago today 94 percent of all cars are clean and free of 
graffiti and less than 3 percent of the citys crimes occur in the 
subway which is used by 36 million people daily 
plenty of problems remain derailments are up after a fouryear 
decline the homeless use the subways as dormitories beggars harass 
passengers and thieves jam turnstiles and steal tokens 
and new yorkers half of whom ride the subways daily remain 
skeptical a transit authority survey found they believe serious 
crimes occur in the subway twice as often as they actually do 
some notorious crimes have fueled that fear bernhard goetz 
gunned down four teenagers a violinists hand was severed when she 
was pushed in front of a subway 
but there is no disputing that the systems decline has finally 
been stemmed gleaming new stainless steel cars and sturdy 
rehabilitated ones painted proud red are rolling across 230 miles of 
track that gradually is being replaced 
the most noticeable change is the eradication of graffiti 
four years ago there was not a single subway car in new york 
that was not scarred with spray paint graffiti was in vogue at the 
time and was considered in some circles an art form 
transit authority president david gunn declared war on graffiti 
ordering cars be cleaned one at a time if a clean car was sprayed 
again it was removed from service and recleaned he frustrated 
legions of teenaged spray painters proud of their rolling 
canvases 
gunn is proud of the accomplishment 
he likes to tell of a recent meeting between ta officials the 
mayors liaison with the movie and television industry and a group 
of major producers who wanted to deface subway cars for filming 
purposes 
i said no they said what do you mean no and i said i 
mean no and the car department people were cheering me on gunn 
says 
they said theyd use water colors to mark up the trains and 
recreate graffiti and clean up afterward but we are not going to 
let them go in and mark up trains recreate the nightmare 
if there is a graffitied train they can use it i cant stop 
them from taking a picture if they want to get footage of dirty 
subway cars theyd better hurry up because they arent going to be 
around much longer 
not everyone is convinced that gunns approach is best 
he still firmly believes in the cosmetics rather than the 
reality of the system says sonny hall president of the transport 
workers union he extended the preventative maintenance of the 
buses from every 4000 miles to 8000 miles but he wont let a bus 
go out if it has gum on the floor even if that means a gap in 
service 
still the turnaround has made an impression on the american 
public transit association an industry group representing managers 
of transit systems in the united states and canada 
at a recent meeting in montreal the ta was cited as the most 
improved system on the continent and gunn received the manager of 
the year award 
the graffiti that had become the tas international 
identification mark has been nearly eliminated says apta chairman 
reba malone a board member of via transit in san antonio texas 
the industry looks with pride at the new york city transit 
authority 
but getting the message to the public has proved more difficult 
the ta now is using sophisticated market research and slick 
advertising to change public perceptions 
the image of the new york city transit system is outdated 
across the nation says john linder director of marketing for the 
tas parent agency the metropolitan transportation authority but 
there is no national advertising for the same reason that there is 
no citywide advertisingwere not ready to advertise 
although the system is open 24 hours a day and serves a huge 
territory from the bronx to the rockaways not all lines have been 
rehabilitated 
one recent ad campaign promoted six of the systems 26 lines 
three on manhattans east side and three on the west side that are

david gunn oversees the largest subway system in 
the world with the enthusiam of a boy playing with a newant get everything 
especially japanese food and 
fashionable clothes 
itoh marvels at the size of americangrown vegetables but 
doesnt understand the popularity of hamburgers and fast food he 
follows us politics but wonders can you tell a democrat from a 
republican 
the united states is super other than its fast food itoh 
says when i brought my daughter home from three weeks at summer 
camp with no japanese food i promised her a trip to the best sushi 
restaurant in chicago she said no daddy i want a hamburger and 
a coke 
loneliness can be a problem for people like katsuhiko kawasoe 
51 a diamondstar executive whose wife and children remained in 
japan 
sure i miss them kawasoe says but for the time being 
there are many things to do at work and i play a lot of golf its 
completely different kind of golf course here its so flat and 
its much cheaper than in japan 
the japanese find the american educational system much less 
demanding than their own they worry their children will fall behind 
upon returning home 
to shore up perceived weaknesses in the american system the 
state has been spending 120000 a year since 1986 to pay for a 
special school at illinois state university operated by the rev 
nobukaza tanaka 45 
every saturday 73 japanese in grades one through nine are 
tutored in japanese language and culture mathematics and social 
studies 
we focus on the japanese language because were afraid the 
students might forget their japanese writing reading and speaking 
skills tanaka says after three years in the united states 
quite a large number of young people struggle with the language when 
they return to japan 
diamondstar also hired todd imahori 32 an assistant professor 
of communications at illinois state to train both its japanese and 
american workers 
japanese workers are schooled on body language told to avoid 
crossing their arms during conversations and avoid certain hand 
gestures considered offensive in america 
american workers are taught how to understand english spoken with 
a heavy japanese accent to interpret common japanese gestures and 
the different japanese work ethic 
imahori teaches the japanese workers about american work habits 
and attitudes which are geared toward individual achievement and 
reward rather than the grouporiented goals common in japan 
in japan if a worker gets behind he voluntarily stays late to 
catch up here workers go home at 5 pm whether the work is done 
or not he says then there are the family concerns of american 
workers which must be taken into consideration and holidays 
religious holidays do not exist in japan 
besides institutional help provided by schools and the company 
intergration into american life has occurred naturally with the 
opening of kiku a sushi restaurant and the oriental mart 
the mart specializes in food for asians and natives of the 
pacific islands spices canned goods hugh sacks of rice frozen 
fish vegetables and all sorts of imported delicacies 
it was opened in april by four filipino women who came to the 
area to work as qualitycontrol inspectors at a local power plant 
construction project in the 1970s they stayed in the twincities 
area bloomingtonnormal when the job was finished and became 
naturalized americans 
there was a need for an oriental store in the twin cities and 
we were having a hard time finding jobs so we opened the store 
says laurita walaskay one of the owners 
there are other signs the two cultural opposites are starting to 
mix the end of each tour of duty by a japanese technician prompts a 
party at a local bar with their american coworkers 
we hate to see them go mrs gardner says we all get 
along theres a mutual respect and we go out and drink beer 
together i enjoy them and im looking forward to training in 
japan

editors note with its jails already overflowing and arrests 
increasing new york city has been scrambling to find places to 
house its prisoners one solution has been to build new jails and in 
some cases this has meant transporting inmates hundreds of miles 
heres a look at one such prison which is a far cry from the big 
apples rikers island 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
thieves drugpushers and other 
hoodlums from new york city arrive in this scenic vacation land 
aboard chartered jets they stay in brandnew accommodations 
savoring the bucolic charm of the shore of the st lawrence river 
more than 300 miles from the big apple 
they come to go to jail 
they are men like 37yearold alan foster who says he has been 
in and out of new york citys rikers island jail so many times he 
has lost count 
im not pleased about being so far away from home but compared 
to rikers island this place is all right says foster who was 
sentenced this time to one year in jail for illegal possession of 
stolen credit cards 
cape vincent in upstate new york is now the home of riverview 
correctional facility a 700bed jail that was built in less than a 
year to house criminals from this countrys largest city 
an identical jail was was also built by new york city in 
ogdensburg about 40 miles to the north both opened in august and 
were filled in a month 
i dont know what we would have done without the upstate jails 
they opened up just in time says tom antenan a spokesman for the 
new york city department of correction 
new york citys jail population has surged to more than 17000 
inmates largely because of beefedup drug enforcement antenan says 
he says the city is building more jails in lower manhattan on 
staten island and is considering buying more barges to board 
prisoners and adding more cells at rikers island 
the city spent 110 million to build the jails and will pay 40 
million a year to operate them under a 10year contract with the 
state department of correctional services 
h otis radley a town supervisor in this community of 1800 
says the jail is providing jobs and should lead to more development 
maybe even a drug store or another gas station 
weve been losing our young people because theres nothing for 
them to do here radley says working in the prison is a 
respectable job that hopefully will keep our young people from 
leaving 
critics of the jail which is located on a main road near a high 
school and a state park included radleys brother jerry who runs 
a trailer park he and others were afraid it would hurt business 
i wasnt too happy with the idea when it started says elmer 
gleason manager of cedar point state park and six other state parks 
along the river but now i just hope once they put some trees in 
and do some landscaping that it will just be a forgotten thing 
he says that judging from reactions during the construction of 
the prison this summer the fears that a prison would drive away 
tourists probably were unfounded 
people see it as an attraction just another thing to come and 
look at when theyre tired of sitting by the river gleason says 
some worry that the prison will change the homey atmosphere of 
the community where car keys are left in ignitions bicycles are 
not locked in garages and people are friendly 
this is really hometown america says donald brennan 
principal of thousand islands high school if the prison is going 
to change things we hope whatever happens is positive 
brennan says there has been little reaction among the high school 
students even though students pass the facilitys fences on the bus 
twice a day 
inside those fences guards proudly show off the new washing 
machines the gleaming wood floor in the gymnasium and the walkin 
freezers in the cafeteria 
inmates talk about how good the food is how professional the 
guards are and how the toughest adjustment may be getting accustomed 
to only being able to watch three channels on television 
inmate foster says that when he stepped off the plane and looked 
around he forgot about the whispers onboard of the trip being a 
bluff especially when he saw the shotgunarmed guards greeting him 
as he stepped through the doorway 
i didnt know where i was but i knew wherever it was we 
werent welcome he said 
thats the first signal to the prisoners that this jail is not 
rikers island north 
most of them are pretty scared when they first look out says 
prison guard pat leconey especially when they see us standing 
with the shotguns usually it takes a few weeks before they get the 
new york city attitude back in them

although candice bergen learned comedy on her 
fathers knee across from charlie mccarthy she was frequently cast 
as an ice princess 
look i was never an obvious choice for comedy she says 
now she has her chance she stars as a television newswoman in 
the new cbs series murphy brown 
what i love about murphy is that shes a character part 
bergen says shes not a straight leading lady she has these 
edges shes testy she has her frailties 
the role was not written for bergen and cbs initially resisted 
casting her yet she has taken to it as though she was born to play 
comedy 
which she may have been being the daughter of ventriloquist 
edgar bergen and being raised in the same household with charlie 
mccarthy and mortimer snerd 
my father was this very private very reserved man who 
expressed this very trenchant and often bawdy humor through 
charlie she says he said things through charlie he could never 
say otherwise i grew up around magic tricks and learning to throw 
my voice he and i would sit together and read cartoons from the new 
yorker and hed ask me why each one was funny 
i never had much chance to play comedy in films i was always 
cast as the ice princess i think of my father a lot because we were 
very much alike our humor is the same murphy is similar to charlie 
in that shes fairly fearless and sassy 
bergen told of her growing up with charlie mccarthy in her 
bestselling 1984 biography knock wood 
murphy brown is bergens first venture into series 
television and it appears to be a good start she plays an 
anchorwoman on a television magazine show called fyi she fits 
perfectly into the character who is the kind of person whose motor 
is always running murphy is a little overwhelming and certainly 
larger than life shes talented bright and sophisticated yet 
ultimately vulnerable 
bergen takes chances with the role as when she bursts into an 
offkey rendition of a motown tune its the kind of thing that 
could make an actress look foolish but she uses it as an 
opportunity to reveal murphys human side 
its great to have a role you can do something with week after 
week she says our characters just keep growing and expanding 
thats a luxury ive never had before the more i play murphy the 
more possibilities i find 
her character also breaks new ground on television the series 
opened with murphy just out of the betty ford clinic where she had 
gone for alcohol addiction she also gave up smoking during her 
stay it makes the point that people can kick addictions and 
function well afterward 
bergen notes with some irony that 15 years after she was offered 
a job as a correspondent on cbs 60 minutes she is now playing 
a fictional counterpart 
i love being a journalist she says ive loved and 
followed journalism for years and have done some myself so i dont 
have to research the role i did a photojournalism series for the 
today show so its great to be doing a show with the texture of 
network journalism its a very savvy show 
her articles and photos have also appeared in a number of 
magazines and in the 1982 movie gandhi she was an obvious 
choice to play life magazine photojournalist margaret bourkewhite 
in recent years bergens career has shifted toward tv movies and 
miniseries its the kind of career move forced upon many performers 
after they pass 40 because of the movies preoccupation with youth 
she was in the miniseries hollywood wives and such movies as 
murder by reason of insanity arthur the king and 
mayflower madam 
bergen whos married to french director louis malle took time 
off for the birth of her daughter chloe three years ago shes 
only recently returned to work 
although she studied art history and writing at the university of 
pennsylvania it seemed inevitable she would go into the family 
business her cool blonde nordic beauty landed her modeling 
assignments while still in college she made her film debut in 1965 
in the group director sidney lumets adaptation of mary 
mccarthys brittle soap opera tracing the graduates of one of the 
seven sisters colleges 
frequently she was cast in what she calls ice princess roles 
as in carnal knowledge olivers story and the tv movie 
mayflower madam only rarely was she cast in comedies such as 
starting over and rich and famous 
two of her best roles were in ephe was steve 
mcqueens love interest in the sand pebbles in which she played 
an american woman caught between feuding chinese warlords in 1926 
mcqueen was a cynical saic adventures silor aboard the yangtze river gunboat 
uss 
san pablo who comes to her rescue in the wind and the lion she 
was an american woman kidnapped by a moroccan sheik played by sean 
connery at his swashbuckling best

long before there was mrs garrett of diffrent 
strokes and the facts of life there was mrs peachum in the 
threepenny opera and mammy yokum in lil abner and even 
mistress quickly in shakespeares henry iv parts 1 and 2 
charlotte rae actress singer and comedian had a thriving 
theater career in new york for more than 20 years before she made 
her way west to television land 
now she has returned to the theater touring the country in 
into the woods the stephen sondheimjames lapine fairy tale 
musical that goes beyond happily ever after miss rae and 
british singer cleo laine are the bestknown members of the large 
ensemble cast 
in the show miss rae plays jacks mother of beanstalk fame 
its a small role different and darker than what most people 
remember from the original fairy story 
people who know me only from television from mrs garrett 
they wont believe its me the actress says i saw this play 
last spring on broadway and it blew me away i was dissolved in 
tears the music was so exquisite 
when this opportunity came along to play a small part in a 
sondheimlapine musical i just said to myself oh god will you 
give me permission can i do it 
he apparently said yes because after auditioning for 
sondheim and lapine she sang the first act finale from the 
threepenny opera and lonely town from leonard bernsteins on 
the town miss rae got the part 
the hardest thing is trying to learn it all in two weeks before 
you open she says its a true work of art its not just a 
little jazzy piece once youve mastered some of it you are so 
thrilled i love being bathed in that sound and just being one of 
the singers 
miss rae didnt start out to be a singer she had intentions of 
becoming a serious actress and went to northwestern university to 
major in speech in her sophomore year she was waylaid by the 
waamu show an annual spring musical starring students at the 
school 
i ended up doing all the sketches and a song by sheldon harnick 
who later wrote fiddler on the roof she says that certainly 
widened my range 
when miss rae graduated she went straight to new york with all 
her theater chums including harnick and comedian paul lynde she 
rarely was unemployed landing roles in many important productions 
including the legendary and longrunning offbroadway revival of 
the threepenny opera 
miss rae developed a reputation as a zany singer with a fine 
sense of timing a skill she honed during her stage career in new 
york that work encompassed musicals like lil abner 
pickwick and three wishes for jamie and more serious fare 
like joe papps shakespeare festival in central park 
composers artists actors singers all of them i think 
unconsciously learn from others she says im sure its not 
conscious but they cant help it i know i was influenced by 
beatrice lillie i must have been 
eventually she and her family decided to head for los angeles 
my former husband wanted to move to california miss rae 
says he is a music editor and music coordinator he coordinated 
the music for the film version of amadeus 
so many people have moved there from new york and i felt at 
home 
miss rae found steady work in television jobs that led to a 
recurring role as the housekeeper on diffrent strokes and then 
graduating to headmistress of a girls school on its spinoff the 
facts of life her constant employment in television lasted some 
10 years before she decided she had had enough 
i wanted to move on and i needed some time for the rest of my 
life miss rae says i needed time for my family myself my 
friends 
television does devour you because you have all sorts of 
responsibilities and i really needed to renew myself she adds 
i think i owed it to myself so i honored myself and quit i 
think thats a wonderful way to put it 
now miss rae has formed a production company to create projects 
that will give her opportunities to play roles far removed from mrs 
garrett and the facts of life shes also working on a onewoman 
stage show and is interested in reissuing an album of theater songs 
she recorded in the 1950s called songs i taught my mother the 
recording includes rare material by writers such as harnick ogden 
nash vernon duke and marc blitzstein 
the songs are all a little on the naughty side but they are fun 
because nothing is naughty today she says with a laugh 
for the moment miss rae will have into the woods to keep her 
occupied but since leaving her television series she also has 
become involved with an international group called friendship force 
it promotes the exchange of visitors between different countries 
and miss rae is their spokeswoman 
the whole idea is that we are ambassadors of peace on a 
personal basis she says we try to understand each other and 
we have developed such a bond the more people who join the less 
chance there is for conflict if we understand each other 
if all goes well im going to the soviet union next year and 
stay with a family in a small town i cant wait

a volcanic dot 1000 miles out in the indian 
ocean from africa the islandnation of mauritius is in the midst of 
an economic boom what is being called the mauritius miracle has 
turned a backward economy around so drastically that now nearly 
everybody works money is flowing in and ethnic tensions have eased 
at least for now an ap correspondent who visited the island tells 
how it all came about 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
just six years ago its 
sugardominated economy was reeling and 22 percent of its work force 
was unemployed but today this island nation is an economic tiger in 
the indian ocean 
like the nearly suicidal taxi drivers on its narrow roads 
mauritius has hurtled from third world lowincome economic status to 
a middleincome nation where practically everybody has a job and the 
money is pouring in from tourists flocking to its beaches and new 
industry implanted by foreign investment chiefly from asia 
some call it the mauritius miracle but the prime minister 
sir aneerood jugnauth wont have it 
there is no miracle he said it is due simply to hard 
work discipline and will 
real growth has averaged 7 percent since 1983 largely as a 
result of the foreign investiment aggressively sought by the 
government 
unemployment has declined to just under 4 percent virtual full 
employment with jobs in some sectors going begging from 1985 to 
1987 20000 new jobs were created each year in manufacturing alone 
among the islands 1 million people and it has replaced sugar as the 
main industry 
annual per capita income is estimated at 2000 up from 1000 
six years ago on the 720squaremile pearshaped volcanic island 
500 miles east of madagascar and 1000 miles east of the african 
mainland 
earnings from tourists drawn to mauritius beaches doubled 
during the same period and excellent sugar harvests have further 
fueled the boom 
the chief opposition leader prem nababsing acknowledges it 
is a fact that there has been great progress we have had a good 
program from the government side on investments 
jugnauth in an interview cautioned however that the success 
could disappear as quickly as it came and that is why i always 
call upon our people to be reasonable to be fair and not to think 
that we have already achieved success for eternity 
the government is working on setting up an offshore banking 
center and stock exchange it hopes to replace south africa as a 
regional center for international companies and to become a stepping 
stone for asian firms interested in africa 
the growth rate has already begun to slow down which is just 
what the country needs said finance minister vishnu lutchmerenaidoo 
he said inflation is soaring rising from less than 1 percent 
to 15 percent in the past year and the country is seriously short 
of skilled labor 
slower growth will give mauritius time to work on curbing 
pollution improving the quality of life and training workers for 
more specialized jobs the goal is to shift from the manufacture of 
knitted woolen garments its chief export to electronics and other 
higherprice items 
a qualityoflife department has been set up financed by liquor 
and cigarette taxes and it plans exercise and healthfood campaigns 
and a nationwide antismoking program 
large amounts will be spent on environmental programs 
we are very much aware that if the present growth rate is 
maintained and corrective measures are not taken we are heading 
toward a dirty mauritius a rich and dirty mauritius said finance 
minister lutchmerenaidoo 
theres much to save 
graceful mountains rise dramatically above the cane fields 
appearing higher than their altitudes piton de la rivere noire is 
the highest at 2711 feet 
buddhist pagodas hindu shivalas tamil temples moslem mosques 
and christian cathedrals dot the landscape on an island that mark 
twain said was created before paradise came into being and served 
as a model for the latter 
but slowing down the economy further isnt easy lutchmeenaraidoo 
said investment is continuing more than 1500 hotel rooms are 
under construction and the government recently approved a 15percent 
increase in the minimum wage to 1035 a week for employees working 
in manufacturing however with labor in demand most workers are 
paid far above the minimum 
were buying social peace lutchmerenaidoo said if people 
dont believe in what you are doing they wont follow you 
there is no sign of complacency among government officials or 
businessmen we cannot afford to sit on our backsides said 
danielle wong manager of the mauritius export processing zone 
speaking to a group of african businessmen and women at a seminar 
on the mauritius economic boom she said protectionism and 
competition from other developing countries meant there was no time 
for relaxing 
delegates from half a dozen east african countries were clearly 
impressed several noting their governments had endorsed similar 
export efforts but done nothing 
ondiek okelo of the kenya trade promotion center said this is 
where it has happened this is a great success story weve have 
been very impressed

export manager wong asked by delegates if the government 
consults with industry before levying new taxes responded of 
course they come to us to talk and if they are proposing taxes that 
are too high we say you are going to blow up the economy and you 
will be kicked out of government 
the export zones more than 500 businesses employ more than 
90000 people 
this courtship of government and industry began after the 1982 
elections which themselves serve as a guide to mauritius jokes 
were made during that election about the economy being as dead as 
the dodo bird which became extinct after dutch hunters here wiped 
them out several centuries ago 
an alliance led by the jugnauths mauritian militant movement 
mmm defeated the prowestern government taking all 60 elected 
seats but jugnauths government immediately began implementing the 
suggestions of western creditors 
while jugnauths government was slashing corporate taxes and 
removing duties on many items to entice investors in the export 
zone the island also benefited from an improved world economy 
lower petroleum prices and an absence of cyclones during the sugar 
season but most important was a big influx of money from hong kong 
and other asian nations 
some of these countries had already reached their export quotas 
with western nations and shifted production to mauritius 
meanwhile jugnauth was expelled from the mmm leadership and 
forced to form his own party a year after winning the election his 
new party the mauritian socialist movement has led an alliance 
that has won two subsequent elections 
jugnauths alliance controls twothirds of the seats in 
parliament although it won only 9512 votes more than the 
opposition in last years election in which 89 percent of the 
electorate cast ballots 
in mauritius terms this is political stability and both 
opposition leader nababsing who is with the mmm and finance 
minister lutchmeenaraido credit it with a big role in the countrys 
economic development 
i dont see any other party changing what we are doing said 
lutchmeenaraido 
rather than proposing major changes in the liberal economic 
reforms nababsing says it was his party the former party of the 
prime minister that initiated them 
nababsing does criticize the government saying it has been too 
slow to diversify and that growth is slowing inflation is out of 
control and more attention needs to be paid to avoiding ethnic 
divisions 
since independence from britain in 1968 governments have been 
careful to avoid fanning ethnic divisions among various groups in 
the hindu majority or other groups 
twothirds of the population are hindus many of them descendants 
of indentured laborers brought here by the british to work the sugar 
planations 
about 28 percent are creoles descendants of africans and 
europeans or africans and asians about 3 percent are of chinese 
descent and the rest descendants of french or other european stock 
english is the official language but creole a mixture of french 
and other languages along with french are spoken by the vast 
majority 
road signs are in english but advertisements and newspapers are 
in french 
french and creole had already been entrenched before the english 
captured the island from france in the 19th century before the 
french the dutch occupied the island from 1598 to 1710

prime minister sir aneerood jugnauth 
has surprised all those both friends and foes who viewed him as 
just a figurehead when he took office six years ago 
far from resting on the ceremony of his office jugnauth has 
presided over an unprecedented economic boom for his island nation 
surmounted several politicial crises and scandals and narrowly 
escaped assassination nov 6 
no one sees him as a figurehead now 
since 1983 i had to follow a tough line inculcate discipline 
at all levels especially among the working class the 
58yearaold leader said in an interview i had to assure 
industrial and social stability of course coupled with political 
stability which brought in the confidence required on the part of 
investors to come here 
he added i must say i have had lots of problems since i 
started but i think i have a strength in that i am sincere in what 
i am doing i believe that our country has a great future i have 
always believed that we are destined to play an important role in 
this region especially economically and i have always had the will 
to pull on 
unlike many other politicians i dont mind even if i have to 
take unpopular measures in the interest of the country to do it 
when he took office many felt jugnauth was chosen solely because 
he was a hindu and hindus make up twothirds of the islands 1 
million people 
nevertheless it was during a hindu religious service nov 6 that 
a hindu priest was disarmed as he held a gun to jugnauths head 
the motives of the alleged assailant who is facing charges of 
attempted murder remain unclear 
jugnauth said i must tell you that since 1983 wherever i go 
i always have the apprehension that something may happen to me some 
day i am exposed the risk is always there 
but i was a bit shocked because i never thought in the place 
were i was surrounded by the kind of people i was surrounded by in 
whom i have 100 percent trust that they would never do anything to 
harm me and the danger came from that source from that quarter 
this is what shocked me 
but many mauritians still see the prime minister as a prime mover 
said finance minister vishnu lutchmeenaraido the world today 
acknowledges the fact we are a progressive country wedded to the 
ideals of democracy and secularism much of the credit of the 
gigantic economic and industrial development of recent times 
goes to the prime minister

here are some facts and figures on mauritius

reef and several mountains rise dramatically with the highest 
reaching 2711 feet sugar cane fields cover 87 percent of the 
arable land in the southwestern indian ocean 500 miles east of 
madagascar and 1000 miles off the east coast of africa the 
volcanic island covers 720 square miles about half the size of

history although visited by arab and portuguese sailors the 
island was uninhabited the dutch occupied it in 1598 and named it 
maurtius after their stadholder maurice of nassau france claimed 
the island after the dutch abandoned their settlement and imported 
african slaves to work the sugar plantations britain took the 
island in 1810 largely to stop attacks by pirates based on the 
island and thousands of indian laborers were brought in to work the 
fields after slaves were freed agitation for political 
representation began in the 1930s and in 1947 limited selfrule was 
granted progress towards independence was delayed by the opposition 
of some creole groups who feared domination by the indian majority 
in 1968 the island became independent with a conservative hindu sir 
seewoosagur ramgoolam as its first prime minister

grated movies have become as scarce as truth in presidential 
elections so it is heartening to find two on the holiday bill of 
fare both are animated features both can be enjoyed by teenagers 
and adults as well as small fry 
oliver and company is the most fully realized animated film 
from the disney co since 101 dalmatians it is inspired 
entertainment in all departments characters animation comedy 
plot and voices it should be another perennial for disney 
the story is loosely based on dickens oliver twist very 
loosely the locale is manhattan not london fagin is a nerdish 
petty crook not a criminal mastermind and his youthful charges are 
a ragtag bunch of dogs not cockney urchins 
the newcomer to the gang is oliver a spunky kitten who failed to 
get adopted from a street corner carboard box he is befriended by 
the roguish dodger urch officials say mass would be celebrated in the church 
of 
the nativity as usual this year but no decision had been made on 
whether the latin patriarch will lead a religious procession in 
manger square 
the uprising has left its mark on this half moslem half 
christian town of 50000 four miles south of jerusalem shops were 
closed monday and streets deserted during a general strike ordered 
by the underground leadership of the revolt 
israeli soldiers with machine guns patrolled the main highway 
into town and guarded manger square from two rooftop lookout posts 
five soldiers were in the square eating a lunch of sandwiches and 
oranges 
a few tourist buses were parked to the church of the nativity 
but as many as 50 at a time squeezed into the square before the 
uprising 
visitors were taken through the church quickly monday then back 
to the buses and some were disppointed its a shame that the 
shops are closed said jill parker 24 of britain 
salvador bandak 56 whose souvenir shop was closed for the 
strike said the rebellion had ruined his business in two weeks 
i sell one dollars worth of goods he said 
others in the tourism industry bethlehems main business have 
similar problems 
michel kreiten manager of the 60bed star hotel said only four 
of his rooms were reserved for christmas bethlehem hotels are 
accustomed to full bookings months in advance of christmas 
nasser the deputy mayor said the town council decided to cancel 
official celebrations in support of the uprising no formal vote was 
taken but the decision was unanimous he said 
some christians in bethlehem said they would support the decision 
and restrain private holiday observances 
i wont have a tree this year and people in my family are not 
going to exchange presents kreiten said i dont think anyone 
will celebrate 
rachel elian a 48yearold housewife said im not going to 
bake cookies and sweets my friends son is in prison how could i 
tell her merry christmas and her son is not at home 
her husband robert disagreed he said christians are becoming a 
beleaguered minority in bethlehem and should assert themselves by 
celebrating christmas 
all year weve had days of sorrow he said we need a day 
to smile bethlehems plans for the season were not welcome news 
to tourists i dont think its a good idea said reinhard 
steffen a 24yearold west german one should keep the old

pop and the seventh sign 
 
three men and a baby touchstone home video vhsbeta 
8995 rated pg 
 
there have been far funnier movies in the past couple of years 
than three men and a baby but none that have made as much money 
a phenomenal 167 million at last count 
any film that successful has to have something going for it in 
this case its one awfully cute baby played by 5monthold twins 
lisa and michelle blair and three awfully cute grown men tom 
magnum pi selleck ted cheers danson and steve guttenberg 
of diner cocoon police academy and other movies 
in this adaptation of the french comedy three men and a 
cradle the men play welltodo bachelors whose carefree romantic 
life on manhattans upper west side is rudely interrupted by the 
arrival on their doorstep of a baby girl it seems danson who plays 
an irresponsible nottoobright actor is the father and the 
mother is a struggling actress who temporarily just cant cope with 
both motherhood and a career 
at first the guys are horrified but gradually they learn to 
bathe the baby change her diapers hold her when she cries and 
finally to love her and want to keep her this makes for some 
goodnatured fun needlessly complicated by a subplot involving drug 
dealers whose smuggled heroin has been dropped off in the bachelor 
pad 
selleck whose previous film roles as a romantic swashbuckler 
left audiences cold is appealing in a lowkey way danson is more 
or less the same egotistical clod he plays on television guttenberg 
comes across as the most genuine of the three 
the movie was directed by leonard nimoy mr spock of star 
trek fame his style is efficient but unimaginative perhaps in 
keeping with his television roots

tokyo pop warner home video vhsbeta 8995 rated r 
 
tokyo pop is a fairly routine story of young love dressed up 
in punk clothes and shipped off to japan still its charming and 
fun 
wendy carrie hamilton yearns to move from backup singer to lead 
in new york citys downtown music scene down on her luck she gets 
a post card from a friend in tokyo and decides to join her 
hiro yutaka tadokoro of the japanese band red warriors 
meanwhile is a very westernized tokyo rocker singing blue suede 
shoes in a band whose members are convinced they will make it big 
if only they can find a gaijin or foreigner to sing with them 
you can guess most of the rest of director fran rubel kuzuis 
film though there are twists along the way to wendys becoming lead 
singer in hiros band 
for all its rebellious appearance tokyo pop is moralistic 
there are no drugs and the characters drink only moderately wendy 
and hiro do wind up in bed but theres no promiscuity what the 
kids in the movie want is a straight version of success and 
happiness 
the small touches of the movie give it its charm wendy finding 
her friend has gone to thailand spends her first night in tokyo in 
an inn called mickey house and lavishly overdecorated with mickey 
mouse paraphernalia scenes of young japanese imitating western 
rockers in a park are fun as are other signs of the mix of east and 
west in modern tokyo 
but the movie misses its chance to explore deeply the inevitable 
culture clash between wendy and hiro and instead relies on repeated 
laments of you wouldnt understand and focuses on their common 
troubles 
the movie is partly in japanese with subtitles 
hamilton and tadokoro are quirky energetic and engaging and keep 
tokyo pop from being merely the kind of fluff wendy complains 
about having to sing

back by popular demand mercury kurtis blow 
 
rapper kurtis blow wants you to know hes back and lest you 
forget it five of the 10 songs on back by popular demand deal 
with that fact 
blows ego exercises on his latest album would be easy to fault 
if he didnt pull them off with such good humor wit and some of the 
hottest music around 
one of the original rap music stars he took a selfimposed break 
from recording in 1986 as he raps in still on the scene some 
of that time was spent watching cable with my feet on the table 
collecting royalties from my record label 
but he had to come back ysee because hes the king 
blows got the answer for every dancer he says in the title 
cut and as he defends himself against the critics and rap upstarts 
in im true to this im not new to this im true to this 
then in get on up he says every bit of me is the 
epitome of rappin excellence 
get the picture 
you kind of wish he would have crammed the attitudinizing into 
maybe two or three songs though because blow really connects when 
he tackles other subjects 
in only the strong survive for example he paints a stark 
picture of crack devastation the song opens with an ambulance 
dispatcher working the death of a 19yearold later in the song he 
graphically details the rise and fall of a young basketball prodigy 
who eventually drops dead on the court bobby had problems and 
the fans could tell cos he used to play the game so well 
with the exception of blue iguana a tropicalflavored dud 
the music burns the percussion by jorge bermudez and willie loya 
is especially sharp and direct 
turn it up listen closely start dancing do it now

let it roll warner bros little feat 
 
in music as well as politics preconceptions are important 
no one brought great expectations to the release of a new little 
feat album in 1988 much like a droning public speaker anticipates a 
mediocre debate performance after all the influential 1970s band 
disintegrated more than a decade ago and former leader lowell george 
is long since dead 
so its a surprise that the reformed little feats new record 
let it roll contains some bracing music the title cut hate 
to lose your lovin and one clear moment are all crackling 
good tunes brisklypaced funk rock with powerful hooks 
that alone is enough to make let it roll a success to most 
listeners its already exceeded expectations 
but this is a shallow album the quality drops off precipitously 
after the three successes hanging on to the good times and 
listen to your heart hearken back to the colorless days of 
california rock the former an insufferable tale of middleaged 
rockers reminiscing about allnight parties 
the aptlytitled business as usual comments on world affairs 
with this insightful passage came home last night wishin i 
could unwind turned on the news you know it blew my mind 
the song eventually becomes an attack on two easy targets 
television evangelists and the press unless those attacks can be 
done imaginatively like don henleys dirty laundry theyre 
nothing but a bore 
little feats members are exceptional musicians and they enlist 
vocal help from such pros as bonnie raitt linda ronstadt and bob 
seger but their music lacks the consistent inspiration that sets 
some musicians as well as politicians apart from the crowd

new jersey mercury bon jovi 
 
many bon jovi fans say the best thing about the group is singer 
jon bon jovis hair it doesnt appear hes had it cut since the 
release of the bands last album slippery when wet which has 
sold 13 million copies so new jersey is likely to be another 
hit even though jons long locks cant be heard on the record 
what can be heard are ripoffs of bruce springsteen the most 
blatant being the hungry heartish born to be my baby on 
the next cut living in sin jon mimics the harmony vocals of 
steven van zandt who used to be in springsteens band and then 
theres blood on blood an unintentional parody of the bosss 
narrative epics 
bon jovi shows it has varied tastes by stealing three or four 
aerosmith guitar riffs for homebound train 
new jersey contains flashes of originality and humor the top 
10 hit bad medicine is good fun with clever lyrics and an 
anthemic chorus two strong cuts close the record 99 in the 
shade a summertime party boogie tune and love for sale an 
acoustic bluesy shuffle 
but the other 45 minutes of music is mostly loud obnoxious 
arrogant and dumb those ingredients sometimes make for great rock 
records but new jersey is too derivative to be one

during a career that has taken him from 
broadway to hollywood and back again mandy patinkin has heard 
enough advice for a dozen careers now hes turning off 
i dont mean to be offensive to anybody who has the rules he 
said during a visit from his new york headquarters for so long i 
tried to follow the rules and i was getting sicker and sicker and 
sicker because none of them was working for me 
i dont know whats right what kind of parts youre 
supposed to take whether to put makeup on your face so people cant 
see you you do a play or you dont do a play you do a movie for 
this reason or you dont 
i dont want to hear about it anymore i want to be left alone 
just go out and do my work you could go nuts with theories about 
how to do it all 
whatever patinkin is doing it seems to be working he has been 
acclaimed for his stage roles as che guevara in evita and as 
georges seurat in sunday in the park with george he has also 
made an impression in such films as ragtime yentl 
daniel maxie and the princess bride 
now hes trying something a little different hes a spaceling 
in alien nations tracking down a murderous crew of drug dealers 
in partnership with cop james caan patinkin is part of a group of 
immigrants who have been subjugated by drugs on another planet 
i loved the character of george said patinkin he is far 
more human than the humans what i loved about the script was the 
speech that he gave to jimmy about how you humans dont live up to 
the standards that you set for yourselves he thinks the human race 
is an extraordinary species and he doesnt understand why they have 
so many problems in such a beautiful place 
the actor admitted that he became entranced with makeup ever 
since he saw photos of dick smith converting dustin hoffman into an 
old codger for little big man the idea of adopting the guise of 
a space creature was one of the lures for alien nation but the 
lure turned into a nightmare 
when we did the tests it was fivesix hours in the chair and 
then 2030 minutes in front of the camera he said then the 
makeup came off when i dipped my head in the dow chemical vat 
on the first day of shooting i was in the makeup chair for 
fourfive hours then i was on the set for 13 hours and i panicked 
i was absolutely going out of my mind i had airconditioning 
hoses going up my arms i was absolutely encased in rubber so my 
body temperature was about 110 except for the whites of my eyes 
there wasnt a pore open 
you get claustrophobic and you panic i was also thinking four 
months of this im not going to make it get the lawyers sue me 
im out of here then i thought i dont want that kind of hassle in 
the business im going to die soon anyway 
he was out sick for a few days and he was more relaxed when he 
returned caan helped out by entertaining with songs and jokes while 
patinkin was in the makeup chair caans name for his alien costar 
mr potatohead 
though one of the theaters authentic stars patinkin would 
nonetheless like to be making more films 
i like working in new york because my family is there and i 
want to be near my kids he said but i also love making movies 
and i like the fact that they reach such a large audience thats a 
plus though theres nothing like being on the boards with that 
crowd right there doing the play with you id never give that up 
i always knew that the stage was the first thing i was going to 
do because when i was 15 i started in the community theater in 
chicago thats what i did in new york first but i always dreamed 
of being in the movies and i still dream of being in the movies 
im no difference from anyone else everyone dreams of being in the 
movies

conductor jesus lopezcobos thinks of home as 
berlin madrid and cincinnati 
i never go to a hotel every place when we arrive i say 
were home said the 48yearold music director of the 
cincinnati symphony 
lopezcobos also is general music director of the berlin opera 
and music director of the spanish national orchestra he recently 
was appointed music director of the lausanne chamber orchestra in 
switzerland effective in the fall of 1990 the year his contract 
ends in berlin 
this season he conducts more than three months in cincinnati in 
berlin hell conduct nine operas including wagners ring 
cycle which he will bring to the kennedy center of the performing 
arts in june 
seventeen years in berlin i think is enough lopezcobos 
said the repertory system is very very hard work you have to 
switch from one opera to the next you can not go only to do a new 
production and then disappear i have to conduct everything 
i knew before i accepted cincinnati that in 90 i would finish 
berlin i knew the first three years would be difficult then i 
would have more time i have decided thats my last opera house to 
run it is not like before when singers stayed they want to guest 
everywhere we have terrible problems to make the repertory he 
said 
for a european conductor it is so pleasant to be with one 
normal american orchestra i couldnt say no 
lopezcobos has a doctorate in philosophy from the university of 
madrid the subject has helped his conducting he says every 
composer is a child of his time of the mentality of his time most 
of them had relationships with philosophers i think it is good if 
you have an idea of what was happening at the time of a composers 
life 
i think specializing is a very bad thing i hear he is a very 
good mozart conductor i think he is already limited the more 
you know about differences between composers and their orchestral 
colors the more you can use it in your work for other things 
lopezcobos whose second wife died of cancer more than two years 
ago is married to cubaborn americaeducated lawyer alicia ferrer 
whom he met in switzerland he has two sons jesus 19 and manuel 
8 who live with relatives in madrid 
the conductor was born in toro spain in february 1940 during a 
time of celebration at the end of the spanish civil war his parents 
named him jesus he says because they thought i was a gift of 
heaven and jesus is a very common name in spain 
i took a long time to decide between philosophy and music my 
father was in the wagner society when he was in madrid as a young 
man he was interested in german culture philosophy and music i 
heard music at home 
as a student in spain i conducted chorales i was always 
interested in singing and the 16th and 17th century music of spain 
after getting his degree he went to vienna to study conducting 
im a little bit fatalistic there were two wellknown conducting 
competitions in copenhagen and besancon france 
he entered won third prize in copenhagen in 1968 and first in 
france in 1969 this encouraged me to try to become a conductor 
we know the chances in spain are almost zero i knew i have to try 
outside spain which is always more difficult than in your own 
country he said 
the first orchestra he conducted was the youth prague 
philharmonic then after spending the 196970 year at the juilliard 
school lopezcobos went to italy 
i knew peter maag a swiss conductor i assisted him in some 
operas in venice he got sick and i had to conduct for him he 
said it was the magic flute his operaconducting debut in 
1970 lopezcobos was 30 
that was my chance he said i stayed almost a year in 
venice until i came to berlin in 1971 lorin maazel resigned from 
the berlin opera to take the cleveland orchestra they decided to 
take three or four young conductors instead of a music director i 
was invited for three performances at the break intermission in 
the first they offered me a fouryear contract i was unsure my 
friends in vienna said go he has been music director since 
1981 
his us conducting debut was in 1972 in a performance of lucia 
di lammermoor starring beverly sills at the san francisco opera 
in 1986 lopezcobos followed michael gielen who moved to the 
badenbaden radio symphony in germany as music director of the 
cincinnati symphony 
lopezcobos also has a recording project with telarc records 
my cincinnati contract is to 1991 he said probably i will 
come with my family to america find a house and from here go to 
europe

the true legend of the traveling wilburys 
began when george har er nelson wilbury needed to record an 
extra song at short notice and invited two of his dinner companions 
to lend their voices 
nine days and 10 songs later the result was one of those happy 
accidents that proves theres more to the music business than 
accountants and estates 
you wont find the names george harrison bob dylan roy orbison 
tom petty and jeff lynne on volume one the debut album by the 
oddlynamed traveling wilburys but the dark glasses and pseudonyms 
cant hide those familiar talents 
we definitely didnt want to treat this like a supergroup 
said petty or charles t wilbury jr i dont even like the term 
all that much but we were aware that it would be viewed as such we 
look at the wilburys as a completely other persona as ourselves 
harrison mentioned to lynne and orbison over dinner last spring 
that he needed a new bside for a 12inch single release the other 
two said theyd help him put together a song 
the former beatle had to retrieve his guitar which hed left at 
pettys california house during a visit a few days earlier petty 
said the lead heartbreaker was also asked to join in on the record 
since all the nearby studios were booked the three amigos had to 
impose on another friend who had recording facilities in his house 
dylan said hed be glad to offer his assistance 
we all sat around the grass at bobs house and wrote this song 
called handle with care and recorded it that night petty 
recalled when it was all done it sounded really good 
much too good they thought for a bside so they kept on 
writing and recording 
it was a very innocent thing really petty said we were 
just kind of enjoying it and we were deep into it before we realized 
almost what we were doing 
that spontaneity and a lot of humor comes through on the 
record volume one sounds like a group of friends albeit 
extremely talented friends enjoying themselves together all five 
trade lead and backing vocals and strum guitars 
the results are a cross between harrisons early 70s solo work 
and the electronic flourishes lynne brought to the electric light 
orchestra orbisons not alone any more is in the vein hes 
mined for a quartercentury and the three songs dylan dominates are 
some of his best work in years 
the song dirty world pokes fun at prince with a series of 
sexual doubleentendres and the wickedly funny tweeter and the 
monkey man is littered with bruce springsteen references 
the record was a true collaboration petty said on tweeter 
for instance he and dylan spoke lyrics into a tape recorder then 
edited them into a story other wilburys added the chorus he said 
credit a nonrocker prince charles of great britain with the 
name traveling wilburys petty said 
harrison and lynne performed at the princes trust concert last 
year and were complimented by the host following the show he said 
the prince said the two should form a band and when they asked for 
a name he suggested the traveling wilburys petty said 
the quintet quickly adopted the persona harrison is identified 
throughout as nelson wilbury lynne is otis wilbury orbison is 
lefty wilbury and dylans called lucky 
the whimsical liner notes explain that the original wilburys 
were a stationary people who realizing that their civilization 
could not stand still forever began to go for short walks 
the offbeat sense of humor seemed to take the pressure off the 
participants and lent the album a certain mystique said paul grein 
author of the chartbeat column in billboard magazine its working 
the album debuted on the charts at no 57 and shot to no 23 in its 
second week he said 
its destined to be a very big hit grein said 
the wilbury monikers also took some pressure off the businessmen 
since harrison dylan petty and orbison are all contracted to 
different record companies there are more than just joking reasons 
why all the names were left off the album jacket 
petty said the wilburys have been approached to do a tour and 
though no ones said no they havent all said yes either 
he hinted that the wilbury family tree might be larger but 
wouldnt say if a volume two is planned theres the obvious 
risk of losing the spark that made this record special 
i dont think anybody wants the wilburys to be work he said 
i would leave the door open to that we wouldnt rule it out 
because we had so much fun i think it could be done again but not 
right away 
we were all very pleased with the way it came out petty 
continued its so nice when you get the spirit into the vinyl 
thats what you strive for i hope everybody smiles when they hear 
it

jamie kalven spent a decade shaping a book out of 
1000page manuscript and a mountain of raw material the 
unfinished lifes work of his father a legal scholar 
although harry kalven died with his task incomplete he helped 
his son see it through 
the result is a worthy tradition a 700page act of filial 
devotion a scholarly essay on the first amendment and how its 
protections were broadened by the supreme court between world war i 
and the early 1970s 
almost everything i know about my fathers views of the fiame after 
his death said kalven who is not a lawyer 
the first amendment his father said has been continually 
enriched and elaboraterst 
amendment cd by the ongoing dialogue of society and 
courts addressing the countless issues it embraces 
among the books central themes is an argument that criticism of 
the government or its officials seditious libel should never be 
a crime 
a worthy tradition was published this year by harper amp row 
and sells for 35 the book bears the elder kalvens name as author 
with a notation that his son edited it 
harry kalven was a noted legal scholar at the universiteatle 
mccartney played piano sang harmony and was producer of the song 
tshirt on the nashville bands current album of the same name 
they are probably the first rock n roll band i remember 
mccartney said in a promotional videotape for the crickets ive 
always been a fan of theirs 
the mccartneycrickets collaboration done at mccartneys 
recording studio in england evolved from the crickets appearance 
two years ago at mccartneys annual buddy holly week celebration at 
that time the exbeatle said he was interested in working with the 
group 
the album is the first in about 10 years for the crickets whose 
name inspired mccartney and john lennon to name their band after 
another insect 
it is basic rock n roll with three pieces instruments 
says cricket jerry ji allison a drummer its basically 
what we did back in the 50s 
allison holly and joe b mauldin who is still a member founded 
the crickets in lubbock texas in 1957 they were known for such 
hits as peggy sue thatll be the day and maybe baby 
holly died on feb 3 1959 with ritchie valens and jp big 
bopper richardson when a tour plane they were flying in crashed in 
a iowa cornfield the pilot also perished 
hollys life was the subject of the 1979 movie the buddy holly 
story starring gary busey valens life was recounted in the 
recent motion picture la bamba los lobos did a version of the 
traditional mexican song valens had made into a hit la bamba 
and made it a no 1 tune on the record charts in 1987 
allison and mauldin were not with holly when the plane crashed 
because holly had moved from texas to new york city and was using 
new members of his band 
the two performed occasionally as crickets in the 1960s but did 
not really get back together until 10 years ago at that time they 
began performing as crickets again as the opening act for country 
music star waylon jennings who had been accompanying holly on the 
concert tour when he was killed in fact jennings gave up his seat 
on the plane to the big bopper 
the third current cricket is gordon payne lead vocalist and 
guitarist who joined in 1985 
payne admits he doesnt sound like holly ive tried but i 
dont he said of the former bandleaders style 
the band plays an equal amount of new and old material though 
the album is new songs they close their concerts with thatll be 
the day 
it was our first song and got us started and out of texas 
allison recalled it seems to be the most familiar one to all the 
people 
in the past year the three have performed throughout the united 
states and europe and in australia and canada a tour of japan is in 
the works for 1989 
allison said the crickets played in garages in lubbock in the 
1950s but did not take their name from a cricket they heard 
chirping as portrayed in the movie about holly instead they were 
inspired by another band called the spiders 
we thought insects were a neat name we got a list from 
somewhere and decided to pick another insect allison said 
he said hollys legacy is that he showed that you dont have to 
be a real pretty boy or that you dont have to have a lot of money 
to entertain or have a rock n roll band 
it showed a lot of people that you could get up and write some 
songs and play and not have a whole bunch of publicity behind you 
we sort of wrote the songs ourselves and produced them ourselves he 
wasnt your idollooking kind of guy youd see in photoplay he just 
wanted to sing and play he said 
it was simple music uncomplicated so anybody could pick it up 
ive heard that anybody could go get a guitar on saturday night and 
learn thatll be the day and those threechord songs and have em 
a little group before that it seemed harder 
said payne he sang with such feeling and intensity even bruce 
springsteen says he listens to old crickets records to keep it 
honest he left behind a mold for other singers what youre 
supposed to try to do 
mauldin the crickets bass player said he didnt try to 
interfere with mccartneys work on their album he asked for 
suggestions my answer was usually whatever you think paul

a geneticist and his psychologist wife say 
they have linked mental disorders including mania depression 
hyperactivity compulsive overeating and alcoholism to a single 
inherited genetic flaw 
if theyre right the finding could revolutionize the treatment 
of mental illness difficult and expensive psychotherapy could be 
replaced with new drugs that would compensate for the genetic defect 
however some geneticists say dr david comings of the city of 
hope national medical center and his wife brenda are guilty of a 
colossal mistake or careless misuse of science 
an angry debate over their work erupted recently at the annual 
meeting of the american society of human genetics where david 
comings president of the society this year used his presidential 
address to defend his findings 
he detailed a long list of behavioral disorders that he said 
occurred with unusually high frequency in the relatives of people 
with tourette syndrome 
david pauls of yale university presented similar research that 
directly contradicted the comings findings pauls and his 
colleagues found no unusually high incidence of other disorders in 
families with tourette syndrome 
after pauls presented his data and responded to critical 
questions from david comings geneticists lingered to continue the 
discussion 
i disagree with you completely dr arno motulsky professor 
of medicine and genetics at the university of washington told the 
comingses you make these grandiose schemes without evidence 
in motulskys view thats a misuse of scientific data making 
hypotheses that cant be supported by the facts 
you revolutionize genetics if its true but i think its very 
unlikely he said david comings was visibly hurt by the 
criticism motulsky had been his teacher 
i think you are making claims that harken back to the early 
days of genetics i think youre doing genetics a disservice 
motulsky continued referring to the early 20th century when 
laziness prostitution and criminality were said to be the result of 
bad genes 
the implication was that it was a good idea to sterilize such 
people thereby ridding the population of undesirable traits says 
daniel j kevles a historian at the california institute of 
technology and author of in the name of eugenics genetics and the 
uses of human heredity 
making such generalizations has led to wildly erroneous and 
damaging misuse of science in the past and could easily do so again 
kevles said he said he hadnt read the comingses report and 
couldnt comment on it directly 
not everyone at the genetics meeting was critical of the 
comingses work some praised the pair for their courage in 
proposing such a daring hypothesis 
dr victor mckusick of johns hopkins university a medical 
geneticist who has done extensive family studies with the amish in 
pennsylvania said i lean toward the view that david comings is 
closer to the truth hes a perceptive person 
dr david rimoin director of medical genetics at the university 
of california los angeles noted that even if the tourette gene is 
responsible for some cases of mania hyperactivity and compulsive 
behavior it is not likely to be the cause of all cases of those 
disorders 
many different causes can produce the same disease traits 
and a single disorder such as tourette can show itself in many 
ways so im not surprised by the comings findings rimoin said 
even the comingses most ferocious critics accused them of no 
worse offense than shoddy science there was no suggestion of 
deliberate distortion 
the comingses based their conclusions on extensive studies of 
families of patients with tourette syndrome an inherited disorder 
marked by jerky movements or tics and uncontrollable vocal 
mannerisms including grunts yelps barks and sometimes involuntary 
outbursts of profanity 
the syndrome had been thought rare occurring in at least one in 
2000 americans but david comings said in an interview he believes 
it occurs in as many as 1 in 200 or about 1 million americans 
usually becoming evident in the young more often in boys than in 
girls 
in a 166page report in the american journal of human genetics 
the comingses said that attentiondeficit disorder with or without 
hyperactivity is 10 times more common in tourette families than in 
the general population obsessivecompulsive behavior is five times 
as common conduct disorders 17 times as common stuttering five 
times dyslexia six times panic attacks 13 times multiple 
phobias three times depression 11 times mania and severe 
anxiety 20 times as common 
at the genetics meeting comings added alcoholism compulsive 
overeating and drug abuse other associated symptoms include 
auditory hallucinations short temper exhibition and easiness to 
anger 
all of these disorders are manifestations of the 
yettobediscovered gene that causes tourette syndrome the couple 
asserted 
they explain the findings by suggesting that the gene is 
associated with a biochemical loss of inhibitions many of the 
features of tourette syndrome can be visualized as disinhibited 
active intrusive symptoms they wrote 
david and brenda comings say pauls doesnt see the connections 
because unlike them he doesnt treat patients with tourette 
syndrome pauls is a geneticist not a psychologist 
pauls says his studies included interviews with many relatives of 
tourette syndrome patients while many of the comingses studies 
were based on interviews with only patients and their parents 
our finding is based on direct interview information pauls 
said theirs is based more on clinical impression 
in a lengthy letter in the american journal of human generics 
pauls and his yale colleagues exhaustively criticized the comingses 
findings 
they said the weaknesses in their research make it impossible 
to accept as valid any of the results presented thats strong 
language for an exchange in a scientific journal 
one of our major criticisms of comings is that he confuses 
symptoms with diagnosis said kenneth kidd one of the yale 
researchers tourette syndrome patients have symptoms of 
obsessivecompulsive disorder but do not have the disorder 
different disorders can have symptoms in common 
sue levi past president of the tourette syndrome association in 
new york city said the comingses findings have created confusion 
among patients our organization was contacted by people who have 
problems with substance abuse problems with obesity problems with 
anorexia who suddenly thought they might be carriers of the 
tourette syndrome gene levi said 
we had to be evenhanded about saying the jury is out she 
said 
the jury may not be out for long the association is spending 
200000 this year to enable six laboratories in the united states 
and europe to search for the tourette syndrome gene or a genetic 
marker that will indicate its approximate location on human 
chromosomes 
once such a marker is found researchers will be able to directly 
test the comingses hypothesis that could happen within the next 
few years or the next few months levi said 
despite their differences david and brenda comings and the yale 
group agree on one thing resolution of the controversy will benefit 
patients 
the progress of science often involves debate and argument over 
data that dont agree trying to find out why they dont agree 
said kidd 
in the best sense this controversy can help the broader 
scientific community understand what is different about the two 
groups maybe some third party will gain some insight that neither 
of us has

as irving and gertrude swerdlows son 
paul died of cancer they felt pain then anger and bitterness and 
finally resolve 
when you lose your own child you have a responsibility to see 
that his life has not been totally wasted said gertrude swerdlow 
you also have a responsibility to other parents 
the swerdlows started fact a grassroots organization aimed at 
raising public awareness of cancer and persuading the government and 
public to spend more fighting a disease that touches three out of 
four american families 
like many americans they gave little thought about the extent of 
cancer until their son a 41yearold physician in nuclear medicine 
and radiology died from leukemia feb 28 1985 
the things we saw made us very very unhappy with ourselves and 
very unhappy with the world we live in said irving swerdlow 
why dont we lick this thing this cancer 
fact which has grown to over 22000 people in 18 states in 2 
years initially was called families against cancer terror but 
terror was dropped after groups like the american cancer society 
protested its negative connotations 
anyone whos ever suffered through the pain of cancer with a 
loved one knows terror is an accurate description of what this 
diseases puts individuals and families through said swerdlow 
whose eyes still become moist when he speaks of cancers toll on his 
family 
fact doesnt promote itself as a support group but it has that 
effect 
it wasnt until we learned about fact that we realized we 
werent as alone as we felt said gail bouverat of syracuse whose 
17yearold son marc died in february 22 months after being 
diagnosed with brain cancer 
you know an individual doesnt get cancer a family does its 
a wonderful idea to band families together she said its not 
the original purpose but it does become a support network too 
facts main purpose is to refute the idea that scientists are 
winning the battle against cancer that misperception has effected 
funding for groups like the national cancer institute and american 
cancer society 
were making progress theres no doubt but when you talk 
about cancer youre talking about hundreds of different kinds from 
just as many causes the fight against cancer has gotten a lot of 
publicity but the fact remains were not doing as nearly enough as 
we can or should be doing said swerdlow 
cancer is an epidemic added mrs swerdlow its a national 
problem that needs a national solution the threat is so great 
here are some of the grim facts they cite 
more than 500000 americans die yearly from cancer another 1 
million are diagnosed and another 5 million are treated 
cancer claims a life in this country every 80 seconds on average 
one out of every three children born this year stands a chance 
of developing some type of cancer in his or her lifetime 
cancer is the greatest killer of children and kills more people 
through the age of 54 than any other cause 
cancer drains the us economy of approximately 70 billion 
yearly in earnings lost and medical care costs 
this year eight times as many people will die of cancer than 
died in the entire vietnam war look at what we spend to prevent 
enemies from attacking our country but here we have a silent enemy 
that is invading millions of bodies and were not mobilizing our 
resources said swerdlow 
its useful to have groups like this said dr peter 
greenwald the director for cancer control and prevention at the nci 
in bethesda md the more the public understands cancer research 
and what it takes to battle cancer the better the chances we can 
conquer it

chester langways laboratory holds six miles 
of ice that reveal volumes about earths past and perhaps its 
future 
its all there frozen in time said langway whose 
university of buffalo lab contains the nations store of ice core 
samples from greenland and antarctica a record of natural history 
stretching 150000 years 
ice formed as layer after layer of snow fell and was compacted 
provides a seasonal record more detailed than tree rings or sea 
floor sediments he said 
using techniques langway pioneered researchers have begun 
analyzing ancient ice molecules oxygen isotopes record yearly 
temperature variations dust levels show prehistoric volcanic 
activity tiny bubbles of air give direct evidence of what the 
atmosphere was like thousands of years ago the water that makes up 
the ice can indicate natural levels of elements such as lead 
cadmium sulfur and chlorine and can be used to gauge the effect 
industrial activity 
the ice cores six miles of them are kept in 4inchdiameter 
meterlong aluminum cylinders in a refrigerator at 10 degrees below 
zero technicians in parkas their beards and eyebrows frosted 
prepare the ice for langways experiments and for shipment to 
scientists at another universities 
were just beginning to unlock the secrets in the ice said 
langway 59 a heavyset chainsmoking geology professor who has a 
mountain named after him in antarctica he sometimes jokes about 
spending more than five years in polar regions researching ice 
man is the only animal stupid enough to wander about out there 
but he clearly believes in his work 
particularly in some controversial research involving gases 
trapped in the ice cores scientists have noted a sharp increase in 
carbon dioxide in the last 150 years since the beginning of the 
industrial age part of the debate about the greenhouse effect 
global warming from the buildup of heattrapping gases from 
industrial emissions and deforestation 
a full understanding of how the planet works cant be obtained 
without considering the ice langway said changes in the level of 
carbon dioxide in the past have coincided with changes in the 
climate levels of the gas may even be part of a mechanism that 
causes ice ages and global warming trends 
there have been seven or eight times when the earths climate 
changed drastically with glaciers enveloping the continents and 
then retreating he explained carbon dioxide levels were very low 
20000 years ago when the earth was at its coldest about 13000 
years ago atmospheric carbon dioxide began to increase about 
10000 years ago the ice began to retreat amidst violent weather 
changes probably brought about by increase volcanic activity 
some scientists think the earth may soon undergo a major climate 
change brought on by pollution they have developed computer models 
showing disastrous consequences such as droughts and rising ocean 
levels over the next 50 years 
langway however is emphatic about not drawing conclusions for 
the future from current ice core research you can speculate like 
hell but we just havent done enough research to have all the 
answers 
one problem is a shortage of ice greenlands ice sheet is the 
size of the united states east of the mississippi and antarctica is 
10 times larger even six miles of cores in storage is like 
putting a teacup in boston and one in florida and trying to figure 
out whats been going on in between he said 
langway will take part in two international expeditions next year 
that will drill in greenland and antarctica the first new drilling 
since 1981

the us forest service and nasas jet 
propulsion laboratory have started to develop an aircraftmounted 
computerized sensing system to quickly map forest fires and their 
hot spots 
firefly will be an improvement over the existing flame system 
which has been used extensively to map major fires including last 
summers conflagration at yellowstone national park 
flame captures infrared heat measurements on film but the 
aircraft carrying it must land and an interpreter then must transfer 
the information by hand to maps in a process that takes hours said 
lab spokesman jim wilson 
firefly will provide maps in minutes using global positioning 
system satellites to make more accurate measurements and to transmit 
data directly to fire camps for computerized plotting on maps 
cutting the turnaround time in getting information to the 
firefighters is the key said j david nichols firefly manager at 
jet propulsion laboratory which runs americas unmanned space 
exploration program for the national aeronautics and space 
administration 
firefly will incorporate technical developments made by nasa in 
its remotesensing programs and efforts to enhance spacecraftmade 
pictures of other planets the agencies hope to test its components 
during the 1991 fire season and have it fully operation during the 
1992 season wilson said

children who seem prone to injury as preschoolers 
are at high risk of more accidents between ages 5 and 10 a new 
study suggests 
parents of 10394 british children were asked about injuries 
requiring medical advice or treatment including poisonings and 
nonaccidental injuries those who had three or more serious injuries 
before age 5 were nearly six times as likely to have at least three 
more accidents between ages 5 and 10 
early injuries were the most potent of several characteristics 
predicting accidents between ages 5 and 10 and may indicate 
children who need preventive help said the researchers from albert 
einstein college of medicine in new york city and the university of 
bristol in england the study is reported in the november issue of 
the journal pediatrics 
despite the association between early and later injuries 
researchers said most children who had multiple accidents after age 
5 had not had three or more injuries before that age this finding 
emphasizes the need to provide a safe environment for all children 
they said 
other characteristics found to predict injuries between ages 5 
and 10 were being a boy aggressive behavior having a young mother 
and having many older and few younger siblings

institutional commitment to the tenet that physicians have 
responsibilities for improving the health of the communities they 
serve especially the poor and those lacking access to medical 
care the panel said 
the committee convened under the auspices of the new york 
academy of medicine said opinions differed on when the community 
service should be done and how long it should last 
the recommendation was among several on medical education to 
emerge from a november conference other suggestions included 
greater emphasis on training in outpatient care settings

widespread labor shortages and higher inflation 
will increase the pressure on us employers to raise salaries and 
benefits in 1989 according to the conference board 
the businessfinanced research group said in a report released 
today that its panel of 10 business and human resources experts 
predicted private industry wages and benefits would grow by 5 
percent next year up from 37 percent in the year ended this 
september 
that compares with expected inflation of 5 percent next year 
which would be up from the current annual rate of 42 percent for 
1988 
six full years of economic recovery have produced the tightest 
labor market in decades said audrey freedman the conference 
board management counsellor business seems to have reached the 
edge of the populations capacity to produce additional trained 
workers 
employers are staffing their operations with greater difficulty 
and at rising cost freedman said 
panelists indicated many employers would attempt to deal with 
labor shortages by increasing productivity creating entirely new 
jobs and tapping the continuing growth in the number of women 
workers 
the panelists stated labor shortages next year would continue to 
be the worst in such major metropolitan areas as boston los 
angeles atlanta and northern new jersey and were spreading to 
growth areas such as greensboro nc and richmond va 
it is often difficult to fill secretarial and clerical 
positions in downtown areas such as los angeles due to 
lessthanattractive commuting situations and the high costs of 
parking food and dress said irving margol and executive vice 
president of security national bank in los angeles 
thus stealing efficient secretaries occurs not only between 
companies but also within companies he said 
the panel also indicated there are shortages of highly skilled 
workers including teachers nurses and other licensed health care 
workers in many regions 
some of the nations greatest labor shortages were in the 
category of lowerpaid entrylevel jobs that are staffed largely by 
1624 year olds with no formal training or experience the 
conference board stated however the proportion of 1624 year olds 
in the work force is declining while many of the 10 million of the 
new jobs created in the past five years have been such entrylevel 
type positions 
the rising and continuing demand for these workers have 
virtually exhausted the diminishing supply of employable peopole who 
are able and willing to accept work said mitchell s fromstein 
president of manpower inc the milwaukeebased temporary employment 
concern this phenomenon was anticipated by demographers 
economists and planners yet has caught many major employers by 
surprise as it unfolds

stock prices plunged due to concern over higher oil prices and the 
possibility of a us interest rate increase 
at the end of trading the dollar was quoted at 12200 yen up 
085 yen from fridays close of 12115 yen expectations that the

purchases dealers said 
on the tokyo stock exchange the nikkei stock average of 225 
selected issues plunged 38027 points or 13 percent to close at 
2898332 
analysts said a combination of the firmer dollar and investors 
concern over a possible rate increase and higher oil prices 
triggered a round of profittaking 
it was the largest decline posted by the index since aug 29 
the dollar was bought in expectation that us monetary 
authorities may raise prime lending rates and the nations discount 
rate the rate the federal reserve board charges on loans to 
commercial banks a dealer at the bank of tokyo said

the dollar opened higher at 12160 yen and moved between 12158 
yen and 12200 yen throughout the day

taiheiyo securities co who asked not to be named

has risen along with the stronger yen which is believed to dampen 
inflation by lowering import prices taking pressure off the bank of 
japan to tighten its monetary policy

a union official predicted difficult 
times at pratt amp whitney after machinists narrowly approved a new 
contract despite cuts in medical benefits that angered many workers 
sundays vote was 36323611 to accept the contract 
with 50 percent of the people unhappy i would say were 
probably going to go through some difficult times said george s 
almeida one of the chief negotiators for local 91 of the 
machinists union which represents about 9000 pratt amp whitney 
workers 
another 4000 workers are covered by the contract 
negotiators for the union and the jet engine manufacturer reached 
an agreement on the contract last week 
it calls for wage increases of 9 percent spread over three years 
and retains a semiannual costofliving adjustment for the 
machinists whose pay averages about 1270 per hour 
most workers who opposed the contract objected to a provision 
requiring workers to pay 20 percent of their hospitilaztion costs 
up to a maximum of 500 per year for individuals and 1000 per 
family previously the company had paid all hospitalization costs 
above 150 
now they want to 8020 us said charlie klein an east 
hartford machinist who voted against the contract whats next 
seventythirty fiftyfifty 
the contract covers workers at pratt amp whitney plants in east 
hartford southington north haven and middletown the company 
which employs 45000 people in the united state and canada is a 
division of united technologies corporation 
were extremely pleased that the union membership has voted to 
approve the contract said pratt amp whitney spokesman curt linke 
were disappointed by the closeness of the vote but we had to 
address what is both a local and a national problem of rising health 
care costs 
sundays voting at the hartford civic center was anything but a 
solidarity rally angry workers filled the auditorium with boos as 
union negotiators read unpopular portions of the contract 
before the results were announced many workers were talking 
about striking 
it gets to a point over time where youve got to take a 
stand said greg pixton a machinist in east hartford 
pixton said workers are particularly concerned about health 
benefits because of the obvious physical hazards of the job 
including potentially dangerous machines and chemicals 
union leaders including almeida had urged workers to accept the 
contract they said the contract gains significant ground in 
four areas raises instead of lump sum payments job security 
pensions and union security 
our health insurance has suffered a loss in some areas the 
union negotiating committee said in a statement urging workers to 
ratify the contract it remains however the best health care 
coverage among utc companies and is better than the health care 
coverage at general electric boeing mcdonnell douglas and 
lockheed 
almeida said negotiators accepted the cut in health benefits 
based on the way negotiations have been going throughout the 
country 
almeida said he understood from the negotiations that the new 
8020 provision will eventually affect all utc workers he estimated 
that the policy when applied to the entire corporation will save 
utc 30 to 40 million per year

a senior executive of japans largest newspaper 
resigned monday to take responsibility for involving the prominent 
daily in a stock trading scandal the newspaper reported 
an official of yomiuri shimbun said iwao maruyama 67 vice 
president of the nationally circulated newspaper had resigned 
saying i would like to take moral responsibility as i gave 
serious trouble to the yomiuri newspaper 
his resignation was accepted at a special board of directors 
meeting the official said speaking on condition of anonymity 
maruyama bought 5000 shares of rescruitcosmos a real estate 
firm in the fall of 1986 before the stock was offered to the public 
on saturday a yomiuri spokesman quoted maruyama as saying he 
bought the shares without even knowing they were unlisted 
saturday night maruyama brought the actual shares to a news 
conference to prove he had not sold them for a profit 
the yomiuri shimbun said monday in a statement it is 
regrettable that he maruyama had not disclosed his purchase of 
stock until recently as he is an executive of the newspaper that has 
been working to make clear the scandal 
it said the newspapers investigation of the scandal would not be 
affected by maruyamas actions 
maruyama was the second newspaper excutive to resign for 
involvement in the scandal ko morita president of the financial 
newspaper nihon keizai shimbun quit in july after his purchase of 
recruitcosmos stock became known 
recruit officials made the stock available to some of the 
nations top politicians businessmen and journalists who reaped 
huge proficts after the company was listed on the overthecounter 
market in october 1986 
no laws were broken but the transactions raised serious ethical 
questions about the ties between big business and politics in japan 
the government has since tightened the laws on insider stock 
trading but the measures are not retroactive 
prime minister nobuo takeshita finance minister kiichi miyazawa 
and former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone are among those who have 
acknowledged their aides bought recruit stock but they all have 
denied they knew about it at the time 
opposition parties have charged that more than 1 million shares 
were involved and that hiromasa ezoe who has since resigned as 
chairman of recruit corp the parent company of recruitcosmos 
offered them to a few hundred prominent people in return for favors 
one of ezoes aide hiroshi matsubara was arrested on bribery 
chares in october after he offered money to an opposition lawmaker 
in an effort to obtain a favorable investigation of rescruitcosmos 
in parliament

japans economy will continue to expand in the near 
future the economic planning agency said monday as it released its 
monthly leading indicator 
the basic trend remains unchanged an agency official said 
the economy has remained in an expansionary phase and it will 
continue to do so in the future 
the agency said the index jumped to 50 in september from 333 in 
the previous two months ordinarily an index reading below 50 
indicates an economic contraction but agency officials said the low 
readings for earlier months were statistical flukes 
in other reports monday on the japanese economy 
production at japans factories and mines rose 66 percent in 
october from a year earlier but fell 08 percent on an adjusted 
basis from the previous month the ministry of international trade 
and industry said 
japanese steel makers exported 1906 million metric tons of 
steel in october down 86 percent from a year earlier but the 
value of the exports rose because more of the steel was of 
highpriced specialty varieties the japan iron and steel 
federation said 
japanese motorvehicle manufacturers exported 521932 cars and 
commercial vehicles in october down 21 percent from a year 
earlier the japan automobile manufacturers association said 
it was the seventh consecutive decline following a 16 percent 
decline in september increased overseas production by japanese 
makers has made it less urgent to export vehicles from japan 
officials said 
despite the yens sharp upturn which has made exports less 
profitable many japanese companies have been reporting strong gains 
in sales and earnings 
a senior epa official was reported to have indicated last friday 
that the gross national product may have increased at an annual rate 
of between 6 and 8 percent in the julyseptember quarter from the 
previous three months

the number of working oil and gas rigs fell by 12 
this week to a total 911 reversing a gain of 26 rigs in the 
previous week industry watcher baker hughes inc reported 
the decline continues to reflect an unstable trend in the rig 
count 
a year ago the count was 1161 baker hughes said monday 
the count is a widely watched industry index of drilling activity 
and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as of 
last friday not the number of rigs actively producing oil 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the number of working rigs since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 per 
42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in the 
rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes began 
compiling figures 
the lowest level this year was the reported 880 rigs on may 2 
among major oil producing states kansas and pennsylvania posted 
the biggest gains in the most recent count with two additional rigs 
followed by new mexico and wyoming both up by one 
oklahoma had the greatest decline with six fewer rigs followed 
by texas with four and michigan with three colorado north dakota 
and ohio each reported one fewer rig this week while california and

the supreme court today agreed to referee an 
important railroad industry dispute affecting the ability of 
railroads to sell off their lines and reduce their work forces 
the court said it will use appeals involving the small pittsburgh 
amp lake erie railroad co in pennsylvania and ohio to resolve issues 
troubling railroads and their labor unions nationwide 
at issue in part is the authority of the interstate commerce 
commission to exempt railroads from collective bargaining when they 
sell rail lines a key related question involves the authority of 
federal courts to block strikes in such cases 
the reagan administration supported the iccs plea that the court 
settle the issues which have generated disagreement among lower 
courts 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals ruled last year that the 
pittsburgh amp lake erie railroad pample may not sell its 182 miles of 
rail line in western pennsylvania and eastern ohion without engaging 
in collective bargaining 
the appeals court said the federal railway labor act requires the 
railorad to bargain with the unions over the effects the proposed 
sale would have in eliminating jobs 
the appeals court also ruled that the federal courts lack 
authority to block a strike by the workers 
the appeals court said a federal law known as the 
norrislaguardia act deprives federal judges of the power to bar 
strikes in such circumstances the appeals court rejected the 
railroads arguments that the act may be set aside in cases where 
the icc has approved proposed rail line sales 
there is no inherent incompatibility between recent 
congressional efforts to deregulate the railroad industry and the 
aim of the norrislaguardia act to protect railway workers the 
appeals court said 
implicit in the congressional vision of a vigorous free market 
is the realization that all major participants in the economy must 
be left free to exercise their economic strength the appeals 
court said 
the financially troubled pample announced in july 1987 it would 
sell its rail lines to a newly formed company that planned to 
operate the lines with fewer workers 
the icc approved the plan without requiring the railroad to 
engage in collective bargaining with its unions which then called a 
strike in september 1987 
pample currently is seeking a new purchaser for the lines other 
than the newly formed company called railco 
after congress approved a 1980 deregulation law the icc has been 
encouraging railroads to sell rather than abandon less profitable 
regional lines 
the commission adopted a process to streamline sales by relieving 
railroads of any obligation to bargain with employees 
in a related action the high court rejected an appeal by labor 
unions challenging the sale of 208 miles of track between green bay 
and milwaukee wis by chicago amp north western transporation co 
the court left intact a ruling by the 7th us circuit court of 
appeals blocking a strike by the unions over the loss of some 200 
jobs 
the three cases are pittsburgh amp lake erie railroad co vs 
railway labor executives 871589 pample railroad vs rle 871888 
and rle vs campnw 88464

construction crews labor seven 
days a week in the blazing sun along a tropical stretch of pacific 
coastline building what the government hopes will be mexicos 
resort paradise of the 21st century huatulco 
its as if the creator woke up one morning and went on a binge 
huatulco is undoubtedly going to be the best said deputy tourism 
secretary guillermo grimm describing the resorts nine bays and 
white sand beaches in a recent interview 
only four years ago huatulco was a sleepy isolated settlement 
of 3000 people mostly peasant farmers and fishermen 
since then the government has marshalled 185 million in private 
and public investment to build roads a jetport hotels a marina 
and a city for a population that stands at 14000 and growing 
rapidly the resort was dedicated in a ceremony nov 6 while 
construction continues 
huatulco about 330 miles southeast of mexico city is testament 
to the importance of tourism for a nation saddled with a 102 
billion foreign debt 
tourism will earn mexico 25 billion this year second only to 
oil and mexicos dependence on tourist spending is growing as it 
copes with sagging oil prices and economic crisis 
last year 54 million foreigners vacationed in mexico not 
counting some 60 million daytrippers across the us border that 
was the highest number since 1984 and represented a victory of sorts 
for the government 
potential visitors had chosen other destinations after the 
september 1985 mexico city earthquake and the highlypublicized 
murder of a us drug enforcement agent earlier that year 
with the slogan feel the warmth of mexico the government 
launched an aggressive marketing campaign in the united states 
canada japan and european to bring them back 
about 57 million visitors are expected for 1988 a record year 
though fewer than the 6 million anticipated before hurricane gilbert 
and the paralyzing bankruptcy of the governmentowned airline 
aeromexico 
gilberts strike in september caused 86 million in structural 
damages and another 125 million in lost tourist earnings in the 
caribbean resorts of cancun isla mujeres and cozumel the three 
attractions account for 25 percent of mexicos tourism income 
aeromexicos bankruptcy in april left the governmentsponsored 
resorts of cabo san lucas and loreto in baja california without air 
service only this fall did a regional carrier restore a mainland 
connection to cabo san lucas loreto is still unserved 
the single most severe impact on tourism this year is how 
grimm described the aeromexico fiasco still he exuded optimism 
about the future of mexicos tourism sector 
mexico is blessed with pluses it has 6000 miles of coastline 
an ideal climate raw natural beauty and a people whose nature is 
basically friendly he said 
the full project here is expected to take 30 years to complete 
by the end the government hopes huatulco alone will attract 2 
million visitors spending 1 billion a year 
following cancun cabo san lucas loreto and ixtapa huatulco is 
the latest major resort complex to be developed under a master plan 
implemented by the national trust fund for tourism development or 
fonatur the tiny government agency is the driving force behind 
mexicos bid to become americas no 1 tourist destination 
by combining government funds foreign and domestic private 
financing and arranging debtforequity swaps fonatur has attracted 
260 million in private investment in mexicos tourism 
infrastructure over the past six years the agency financed 75 
percent of the 75000 new hotel rooms built in mexico in the past 
decade and sponsored the remodeling of another 12000 
in huatulco fonatur pitched in 65 million to install 
infrastructure and induce private investment it arranged debt swaps 
to partially finance construction of a 315 million hotel sheraton 
and the luxury veramar hotel both due to open next year

iran has come away from the opec 
bargaining table a winner thanks to gholamreza aqazadeh 
coming into the crucial talks on production and pricing the 
iranian oil minister was expected to play a critical role in sorting 
out the opposing interests of his country and iraq which recently 
declared a ceasefire after an 8yearlong war 
in the end aqazadeh surprised observers with his keen 
negotiating skills in helping reach mondays agreement which 
reduces the cartels production from 225 million to 185 million 
barrels a day and gives iran and iraq equal quotas of 264 million 
barrels 
the accord also maintains the cartels target price of 18 per 
barrel 
he was the most political and most skilled maneuverer said 
pierre terzian editor of the parisbased oil publication 
petrostrategies 
bahman karbassioun an oil consultant based in vienna said i 
think its the best deal he could have gotten 
other ministers wanted iraq brought back into opecs quota 
system the softspoken aqazadeh a former newspaper editor was key 
to that goal 
they got more than what they could have imagined before the 
meeting said terzian of the agreement signed by all 13 members 
of the organization petroleum exporting countries 
the 39yearold aqazadeh a slight bespectacled man with 
prematurely graying hair and beard hardly looks the part of a 
tough bargainer 
dressed modestly in a plain white shirt buttoned to the top no 
tie and dark overcoat the iranian gives the impression of being a 
humble man 
he is not what one would term a hotheaded man said 
karbassioun 
hes very levelheaded hes steadfast in his political 
beliefs he said hes in no way what one would call an 
extremist 
hes too intelligent not to be realistic said terzian 
aqazadeh was active in the islamic revolution that ousted the 
shah of iran in january 1979 analysts say 
hes a product of the iranian revolution said karbassioun 
aqazadeh who holds a bachelor of science degree in computer 
sciences was a founding member of the islamic republican party 
according to a biographical sketch 
he was editorinchief of the islamic republic newspaper from 
19791982 and was deputy to the prime minister from 1981 to 1985 he 
has been oil minister since 1985 
because of his revolutionary background aqazadeh differs from 
other opec ministers some of whom are from royal families 
he has both the political ability and also the logic of a 
computer engineer terzian noted 
to get the agreement which takes effect jan 1 for six months 
aqazadeh gave up what he insisted he would never do allow hated 
rival iraq the same production quota as that of iran 
iran and iraq want more money from their valuable resource to 
help rebuild their wardamaged economies 
iraq had been demanding the same ceiling for years it refused to 
join the previous accord fashioned in 1986 because it was only 
given a quota of 15 million barrels instead of the same 24 
million alloted iran 
aqazadeh vowed he would never permit the two countries to have 
the same quota some delegates whispered he would resign instead 
i always reject parity he insisted to reporters 
in the end he bowed to the iraqi demand but also raised his 
countrys own quota he also was successful in pressing for the 
lower total production level set for the cartel and the 18 target 
price 
he lost to the iraqis i dont think he lost to opec said 
ian graham an analyst with the london brokerage county natwest 
moreover aqazadeh succeeded in maintaining irans share of total 
output at 1427 percent iraq was bumped up to the same level after 
other countries agreed to give up some of their share 
he got a lot for giving up parity said fergus macleod an 
oil analyst at barclays de zoete wedd in london 
thats lot of concessions at the cost of giving up some 
political points he said 
in addition to demonstrating negotiating skills aqazadeh also 
was adept at telling his side of the story 
he was one of the few ministers who would stop to answer 
reporters questions after attending closeddoor discussions 
several times he was mobbed by reporters even getting hit in 
the head once by a swinging tape recorder

major us banks boosted their prime lending 
rates a half percentage point to 105 percent monday the steepest 
level since mid1985 and the fourth rise this year 
the increase will mean a jump in rates on a variety of consumer 
loans pegged to the prime including homeequity loans it lso will 
raise borrowing costs for companies that rely on banks for financing 
economists had been predicting a prime rate increase because 
interest rates in the bond markets had risen recently due to 
inflation fears and the dollars weakness in foreign exchange 
markets 
the financial markets had no major reaction to the announcement 
stock and bond prices were up modestly while the dollar steadied 
against other major currencies 
it comes as no surprise in fact they banks seem to have 
held back longer than i expected said edward yardeni chief 
economist for the investment firm prudentialbache securities inc 
federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan also has warned of 
higher shortterm rates unless the government trims its huge budget 
deficit the source of the dollars woes 
theres a building perception in the marketplace that the fed 
is in fact tightening conditions said william v sullivan 
an economist for the investment firm dean witter reynolds inc 
sullivan and other economists predicted the fed might soon raise 
its discount rate or the interest it charges on loans to member 
banks if that happened the prime rate could be increased again 
they said 
id look for something from the fed in the next two weeks 
said yardeni 
chase manhattan was the first institution to increase its prime 
rate monday and other major banks quickly joined the move 
the prime stood at 85 percent at the start of the year and has 
been raised four times since mondays increase put the key lending 
rate at its highest level since may 20 1985 when it was lowered a 
half percentage point to 10 percent 
the prime rate reflects a banks costs of borrowing money 
including interest it pays on on savings accounts or certificates of 
deposit and trails more subtle increases in other interest rates 
but the rate is watched closely because bankers use it as a basis 
for calculating loans to businesses and for determining many types 
of fixed and adjustablerate consumer loans mortgage rates are not 
included in that category 
its clear that consumers will be absorbing higher borrowing 
costs in december or early next year said sullivan 
economists were uncertain as to what effect the latest increase 
would have on the economy and more specifically on consumers 
spending during the holiday season 
james l kochan chief fixedincome strategist for merrill lynch 
capital markets inc said i think the direct effect is pretty 
small because generally consumers arent affected by modest increass 
in interest rates 
but yardeni said some credithappy consumers might want to cut 
back on spending and buy only things that they can afford 
theres an underlying sense of uneasiness because so many 
people have been through rough times even when the economy was 
strong the prime rate hike coming into the christmas season may 
make people more cautious he said

futures prices of grain and soybeans closed 
sharply lower monday on the chicago board of trade on profittaking 
following the announcement of a new multiyear grain deal with the 
soviet union 
the grain markets had rallied strongly last week in anticipation 
of a grain pact and mondays activity was a classic example of 
buy the rumor sell the fact analysts said 
weve been going up and up and up on expectations for this 
deal and now weve finally got it said victor lespinasse a 
trader in chicago with dean witter reynolds inc 
the 27month extension signed in moscow revived a 5year pact 
that expired sept 30 calling for the soviet union to buy at least 
9 million metric tons of grain a year from the united states 
spotty news of showers in the soybeangrowing areas of argentina 
and brazil also weighed on soybean prices lespinasse said 
at the close of trading wheat was 2 cents to 7 cents lower 
with the contract for delivery in december at 418 a bushel corn 
was 3 cents to 8 cents lower with december at 257 a bushel oats 
were 10 cents lower across the board with december at 205 a 
bushel soybeans were 12 cents to 15 cents lower with january at

the supreme court said monday it would referee 
a railroad industry dispute affecting the ability of railroads to 
sell off their lines and reduce their work forces 
separately the justices allowed prosecutors investigating labor 
union corruption in new york to use subpoenaed membership lists 
obtained from four carpenters union locals 
the high court said it would hear a case involving the pittsburgh 
amp lake erie railroad co in pennsylvania and ohio to resolve issues 
troubling railroads and their labor unions nationwide 
at issue is the authority of the interstate commerce commission 
to exempt railroads from collective bargaining when they sell rail 
lines a key related question involves the authority of federal 
courts to block strikes in such cases 
the reagan administration supported the iccs plea that the court 
settle the issues which have generated disagreement among lower 
courts 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals ruled last year the pample 
may not sell 182 miles of rail line in western pennsylvania and 
eastern ohion without engaging in collective bargaining 
the appeals court said the federal railway labor act requires the 
railorad to bargain with the unions over the effects the proposed 
sale would have in eliminating jobs 
the appeals court also ruled that federal courts lack authority 
to block a strike by the workers 
the appeals court said federal law deprives federal judges of the 
power to bar strikes in such circumstances the appeals court 
rejected the railroads arguments that the act may be set aside in 
cases where the icc has approved proposed rail line sales 
the financially troubled pample announced in july 1987 it would 
sell its rail lines to a newly formed company that planned to 
operate the lines with fewer workers 
the icc approved the plan without requiring the railroad to 
engage in collective bargaining with its unions which then called a 
strike in september 1987 
pample currently is seeking a new purchaser for the lines other 
than the newly formed company called railco 
the icc adopted a process to streamline sales by relieving 
railroads of any obligation to bargain with employees 
also monday the high court rejected an appeal by labor unions in 
a related action that challenged the sale of 208 miles of track 
between green bay and milwaukee wis by chicago amp north western 
transporation co 
in the carpenters union case the court let stand without comment 
a ruling that the rights of the union and its members were not 
violated by forcing the locals to turn over the lists 
a manhattan grand jury in february 1987 issued subpoenas for the 
membership lists of the locals in connection with a probe of the 
united brotherhood of carpenters and joiners by district attorney 
robert m morgenthau 
the new york court of appeals ruled last july morgenthaus office 
could keep the lists pending completion of the grand jury 
investigation 
the state court said forcing the unions to turn over the lists 
and allowing the district attorney to keep them for now did not 
violate freeassociation rights of the union and its members

buildingproducts giant manville corp emerged from 
more than six years of protection under federal bankruptcy court 
monday and began paying creditors and asbestos health and property 
claimants 
with the constraints of bankruptcy behind us we can now 
dedicate all of our attention to growing manville and creating 
shareholder value tom stephens chairman and chief executive 
officer said in officially marking what the company considers the 
first day of the rest of its life 
manville sought protection from creditors under chapter 11 of the 
us bankruptcy law aug 26 1982 saying it faced ruin from 
billions of dollars in suits claiming health problems from asbestos 
once produced by the company 
its refuge in bankruptcy court marked one of the biggest and most 
exhaustive filings in us history and raised major questions about 
use of the federal bankruptcy laws to defer or avoid healthrelated 
liability claims 
manville helped lay the precedent for another major company ah 
robins amp co to seek chapter 11 protection when it felt threatened 
by billions of dollars in escalating health claims for a 
nowdiscontinued controversial product the dalkon shield 
intrauterine birthcontrol device 
the manville bankruptcy contributed to the companys tarnished 
image over the handling of asbestos claims and some surveys called 
it one of the least admired us businesses 
before its chapter 11 filing property damage claims alone had 
come to 85 billion or about 40 times the companys total assets 
manville also faced more than 17000 personal injury claims in the 
billions of dollars 
the filing allowed manville to operate shielded from liability 
suits while it worked out a way to pay the bills it also allowed 
the company time to draft a 25 billion trustfund plan to pay 
asbestos victims 
manvilles reorganization plan was approved by the bankruptcy 
court in december 1986 following several appeals the final order 
implementing the plan was given oct 28 to become effective in 30 
days 
the plan has been both praised and condemned 
manville shareholders will be the big losers winding up with one 
share of new manville stock for every eight shares they once held 
said calvert crary a litigation analyst with martin simpson amp co 
a new york investment research firm 
basically they wiped out their shareholders im disgusted 
with the way manville conducted itself crary said recently he 
accused manville of gross abdication of fiduciary responsibility 
to shareholders 
but stephens who took control of the company a few years ago and 
is widely credited with helping steer it through the final stages of 
bankruptcy said the plan protects shareholders by restoring the 
companys financial health while at the same time addressing the 
asbestos claims problem 
the reorganization plan established a personal injury settlement 
trust to settle claims of asbestos health victims for the next 25 
years manville paid 150 million into the trust and its insurers 
will add 615 million beginning in 1991 manville will make annual 
payments to the trust of 75 million until 2012 
a second trust called the property damage settlement trust 
would settle asbestosrelated property claims manville paid 100 
million cash into it and the companys insurance carriers also will 
contribute millions of dollars 
manville also faces immediate cash obligations of 2475 million 
to commercial creditors 
manville said that as of the close of business monday trading of 
its old securities ceased the new securities will trade under the 
symbol mvl 
manville reported a 164 million profit on 206 billion in sales 
last year 
today the business consists of three parts a fiberglass group 
which produces insulation products and glass fibers a forest group 
producing wood and paper items and a specialty products gorup 
making goods ranging from commercialindustrial lighting to filter 
materials for the beer and wine industries 
founded in 1858 as johnsmanville corp the firm was built into 
an industry leader in the early 1900s as a manufacturer of asbestos 
the fibrous mineral once heavily used in insulation and fireproofing 
materials it was incorporated under the shortened name in 1981 
the companys troubles began in the early 1970s when asbestos was 
linked to a number of serious often fatal diseases including lung 
cancer and asbestosis

the dollar advanced monday in a rally that some 
traders attributed to an opec agreement on production cuts and an 
increase in the prime rate by major us banks 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries agreed in 
vienna to set a daily production quota of 185 million barrels and a 
target price of 18 a barrel the announcement triggered a 
1abarrel increase in oil prices 
the biggest us banks raised their prime lending rates a half 
percentage point to 105 percent the fourth increase this year 
some analysts said the dollars rise was hard to explain because 
the prime rate increase had been widely expected and an increase in 
oil prices usually does not give a big boost to the dollar but 
there were no other ready explanations for the dollars ascent

arthur andersen amp co announced plans monday to 
put its consulting practice on an equal footing with its 
betterknown accounting business in hopes of stemming a flow of 
defections to other consulting firms 
more equal is probably a good way to put it said duane r 
kullberg managing partner and chief executive officer of 
chicagobased andersen the largest us accounting firm and a 
leader in informationmanagement consulting 
the announcement of the proposed corporate restructuring ended 
speculation that andersen would split off or sell its consulting 
practice a 40yearold unit that is the fastestgrowing segment of 
the 75yearold firm 
kullberg told a news conference that andersens 2200 partners 
would vote in early january on a task forces recommendation to 
restructure the company along two lines consulting and 
auditandtax accounting each line would be headed by a chief 
operating officer who would report to the ceo 
andersen currently has one chief operating officer overseeing 
three divisions consulting auditing and tax accounting with 
each division headed by its own managing partner 
consulting partners have complained of being relegated to 
secondclass status by the accounting partners who traditionally 
have controlled the company and the purse strings 
kullberg said a new incentive program offering substantial 
bonuses for exemplary work would increase the pay of andersens best 
consultants and help to keep them from looking elsewhere 
it is intended to be an incentive system that will address that 
particular question he said 
four of andersens top consulting partners left the firm in 
october to join information consulting group inc a company headed 
by two other former andersen consultants that was formed with 
financial backing from londonbased saatchi amp saatchi plc the 
worlds largest advertising company 
andersen has filed a lawsuit in state court in new york accusing 
its departed consulting partners and saatchi of trying to force 
andersen to sell at least part of its consulting business 
the change in andersens corporate structure will not affect the 
lawsuit kullberg said 
we intend to pursue that lawsuit vigorously without 
question he said 
kullberg said andersen hoped to move beyond its frequent 
categorization as an accounting firm by promoting itself as an 
accountingandconsulting company 
of the companys 28 billion in revenues in fiscal 1988 audit 
and consulting work each brought in 40 percent while tax work 
accounted for 20 percent 
kullberg also said andersen was exploring options for increasing 
its capital base but he ruled out the possibility of going public

wall street monday after major banks raised their prime lending 
rates 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 676 to 208144 
advancing issues were about even with decliners in nationwide 
trading of new york stock exchangelisted stocks with 710 issues 
up 726 down and 521 unchanged 
volume on the floor of the nyse came to 12348 million shares up 
from 7209 million in the previous session nationwide consolidated 
volume in nyselisted issues including trading at regional 
exchanges and on the overthecounter market totaled 14526 million 
shares 
the market moved in a narrow range opening marginally higher and 
then dipping after the nations largest banks said they were 
increasing their prime interest rates to 105 percent from 10 
percent 
the increase effective immediately pushes the base lending rate 
to its highest level since may 1985 when it was lowered a half 
percentage point to 10 percent the increase was the fourth in the 
prime rate this year 
wall street was expecting the increase after interest rates crept 
upward in credit markets recently so the banks announcement had no 
major effect on prices 
alfred goldman a vice president at ag edwards amp sons inc in 
st louis called mondays session inconclusive and said 
countervailing forces in the market left prices little changed 
on one side of the coin we have a deep oversold condition and a 
market that is very underbelieved goldman said 
ordinarily that would move prices higher but negative 
influences such as rising interest rates were holding stocks in 
check goldman said 
investors also were wary because of economic reports due out this 
week in particular tuesdays scheduled release of the commerce 
departments revised estimate of thirdquarter growth in the gross 
national product 
the market is responding in a very uncertain indecisive way 
goldman said 
most of the change in the dow jones industrial average was due to 
ibm which rose 2 to close at 118 the american arbitration 
association said it would disclose on tuesday its resolution of a 
software copyright dispute between ibm and fujitsu ltd japans 
biggest computer company 
rjr nabisco rose 1 to 89 as speculators bid up the 
foodandtobacco giants stock on the hunch that fattened offers 
would emerge in the auction for the company the deadline for a 
second round of bids for rjr nabisco was scheduled to expire at 5

the opec agreement to cut oil production sent energy and platinum 
futures soaring monday on the new york mercantile exchange but other 
precious metals posted only moderate gains 
on other markets grain soybean and coffee futures fell sharply 
cattle futures were mostly higher while pork futures were mostly 
lower and stockindex futures advanced 
west texas intermediate crude oil for delivery in january soared 
as high as 1580 a barrel in early trading on news of the agreement 
among oil ministers of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries meeting in vienna austria 
but a statement from the united arab emirates later in the day 
that it did not consider its new production limit an official quota 
sparked some selling on fears that the fragile opec agreement could 
come undone analysts said 
still nearly all energyfutures contracts advanced their daily 
trading limits 1 a barrel for crude oil and 2 cents a gallon for 
heating oil and gasoline the contracts for nearmonth delivery have 
no limits 
west texas intermediate crude settled 1 to 106 higher with 
january at 1503 a barrel heating oil was 2 cents to 293 cents 
higher with december at 4865 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 
191 cents to 2 cents higher with december at 4637 cents a gallon 
the deal signed by all 13 opec members reestablishes a crudeoil 
target price of 18 a barrel and reduces production from the current 
estimated 225 million barrels a day to 185 million barrels 
mondays price gains indicated a belief among market players that 
the chances of opec members abiding by their new production limits 
were a little better than 5050 said andrew lebow an 
oilmarket analyst with ed amp f man international futures inc in 
new york 
if you go back to 1987 during the first half of that year 
there was a general adherence to the quota lebow said but as 
we know from the second half of this year they have also had 
problems adhering to a quota 
the prospect of higher oil prices triggered a rally in the 
inflationsensitive preciousmetals markets monday but only platinum 
managed to hold sharp gains into the close 
platinum settled 1490 to 1570 higher with january at 58670 
a troy ounce 
on new yorks commodity exchange which like the new york merc 
was closed thursday through sunday for thanksgiving gold settled 
310 to 380 higher with december at 42330 a troy ounce silver 
settled 2 cents to 59 cents higher with december at 6115 a troy 
ounce 
platinums move was more realistic than golds said richard 
levine an analyst with elders futures inc in new york considering 
the firming of energy prices and the relatively tight warehouse 
stocks of both metals 
new yorkbased analyst james steel of refco inc said the 
dollars strength on monday may have helped limit the gains in gold 
and silver 
but levine said the dollars surge appeared to be a shortterm 
reaction to the sudden rise in energy prices 
i would look for the dollar to come off if this oil price holds 
and for gold to go higher he said 
grain and soybean futures fell sharply on the chicago board of 
trade on profittaking following the announcement of a new 
multiyear grain deal with the soviet union 
the grain markets had rallied strongly last week including 
modest gains on friday in anticipation of a grain pact mondays 
activity was a classic example of buy the rumor sell the fact 
analysts said 
the 27month extension signed in moscow revived a 5year pact 
that expired sept 30 calling for the soviet union to buy at least 
9 million metric tons of grain a year from the united states 
wheat settled 2 cents to 7 cents lower with december at 418 a 
bushel corn was 3 cents to 7 cents lower with december at 257

205 a bushel soybeans were 12 cents to 16 cents lower with

joseph e seagram amp sons inc announced plans 
monday to drop 25 nonpremium liquor brands it markets in the united 
states close its dundalk md plant and eliminate 240 mostly 
administrative jobs 
the company the us subsidiary of canadas seagram co ltd 
said it was divesting the 25 brands so it could concentrate its 
production and marketing resources on its more profitable 
nationally distributed premium brands 
seagram said it would discontinue production and sales of three 
brands cease acting as sales agent for four brands it does not own 
and relinquish us rights to 18 others some of which seagram will 
continue to market in canada and other international markets 
the brands to be phased out represent about 8 percent of 
seagrams us distilled spirits case sales and about 4 percent of 
its earnings from that business the phaseout will leave it with 23 
us brands 
the planned closing of the dundalk plant which employs 300 
people will begin sometime after june 1 and be completed by the end 
of 1990 seagram said it said the operations at dundalk where 
various distilled spirits are made will be transferred and 
consolidated into other seagram plants in the united states 
principally the facility at relay md 
seagram said it had not been determined how many of those jobs 
may be lost and how many employees will be offered transfers to 
other plants 
the company said its decision to eliminate the 240 positions 
most of them administrative resulted from a review begun several 
months ago of its us operations seagram employs about 3600 
people in the united states 
it said that of the positions being eliminated 78 are vacant and 
91 will involve separations through july 31 the remainder will be 
eliminated through attrition the company said

officials of the european economic community 
have decided against having talks in washington this week to explore 
prospects for averting a trade battle over the eecs scheduled jan 
1 ban of meat from animals treated with growth hormones 
they just saw the americans the weekend before last and theyll 
see them again in another week said ella krucoff speaking for 
the communitys delegation in washington 
us producers stand to lose meat sales which totaled about 169 
million last year in the 12 eec nations and administration 
officials say presidentelect george bush could retaliate with 
restrictions against the sale of european meat products or even 
some industrial products in the united states 
patricia f stolfa of the agriculture departments food safety 
and inspection service said the value of the european meat exports 
to the united states is higher because they include high quality 
items like danish ham the us market in europe on the other hand 
includes a large quantity of cheaper cuts such as hearts and 
kidneys she said 
the use of hormones to speed animal growth is forbidden in the 
eecs member nations which include west germany britain italy 
holland denmark ireland luxembourg the netherlands belgium 
spain portugal and greece 
however there have been widespread reports of illegal use of 
hormones by european producers and ms stolfa suggested it could be 
appropriate to delay the import ban while the european parliament 
completes an investigation already in progress 
earlier monday us officials said imminent talks were possible 
in washington and the eec would be represented by willy de clercq 
a belgian in charge of external affairs for the european commission 
and frans andriessen a netherlander and top agricultural official 
but they apparently decided to wait for a meeting in montreal 
beginning dec 5 when us trade representative clayton yeutter and 
agriculture secretary richard e lyng are due to review trade issues 
with representatives of nearly 100 nations 
lester m crawford of the food safety and inspection service said 
the hormones used on us cattle do not leave residues that are 
harmful to humans he said scientists in europe have supported the 
us position 
the reagan administration has proposed that international 
decisions on the safety of hormones be entrusted to the codex 
alimentarius commission a united nations body with 129 governments 
as members

transportation giant burlington northern inc said 
monday it has agreed to pay more than 175 million to settle an 
antitrust suit brought by pipeline energy transportation systems 
ending a longstanding legal dispute 
energy transportation had claimed burlington northern unlawfully 
blocked construction of a proposed coal pipeline from the powder 
river basin in wyoming to texas and arkansas 
burlington northern said 100 million cash would be paid to 
energy transportation dec 1 and deferred payments of 25 million 
plus interest on each of dec 1 1989 1990 and 1991 to the firm 
a smaller settlement with another plaintiff in the suit houston 
lighting amp power involves future rate adjustments 
don l pope assistant vice president for corporate affairs said 
the settlement with houston lighting would be much less than the 
larger settlement but declined to provide a figure 
he also said burlington northern believed it had a good case but 
settlement was prudent because damages in a federal jury trial could 
have amounted to nearly 1 billion with an award amount tripling 
that figure because it was an antitrust action 
we believe this is a very positive development he said it 
will not impair the financial capability of the company 
bn stock was up 175 to 7475 monday in new york stock exchange 
trading 
the lawsuit was over a project proposed in the 1970s that would 
have sent coal on a line 1400 miles from northeastern wyoming to 
utilities in oklahoma and texas the coal would be crushed to a fine 
powder and carried in a water slurry then dried and burned in power 
plants

gov mario cuomo on monday asked the trustee 
for a 38 billion state pension fund to halt further investments in 
corporate takeovers until a task force can determine if such deals 
hurt the state economy 
the democratic governor appointed a 20member task force to study 
the issue and also republican comptroller edward regans role as 
sole trustee of new yorks common retirement fund 
the common retirement fund has 1 billion earmarked toward firms 
involved in buyouts and 450 million actually committed according 
to cuomos economic development director vincent tese 
the bulk of the investments are with the buyout firms forstman 
little amp co and kohlberg kravis roberts amp co said regan 
spokesman marvin nailor 
kohlberg kravis is involved in the multibilliondollar battle to 
acquire over rjr nabisco the firms role in the proposed buyout 
already has been criticized by some of its other big institutional 
investors who claim some of their existing bond investments have 
declined in value because of the huge amounts of new bonds needed to 
finance rjr nabisco deal 
tese called on regan to impose a moratorium on further 
investments in buyout firms until the task force issues its findings 
in four months tese said he feared that many of these buyouts lead 
to job cuts at the companies involved 
the task force will examine the widespread concern about the 
role of public pension funds in takeovers which put our major 
corporations deep into debt and often exclude the interests of 
bondholders and employees cuomo said 
regan called the study interesting but suggested that 
finding ways to close the states 2 billion budget deficit was more 
important nailor said the comptroller was considering cuomos 
suggestion for a moratorium 
the task force which will be headed by eugene keilin a partner 
in the investment banking firm of lazard freres also includes tese 
cuomos chief counsel evan davis and budget director dall 
forsythe who has been in charge of the cuomo administrations 
efforts to cut the budget deficit 
the states other two public employees pension funds the new 
york city employees retirement system and the state teachers 
retirement fund dont invest in firms conducting takeovers tese 
said 
cuomo long has advocated that state pension decisions be made by 
a special board and not just the comptroller regan also has 
supported creation of a pension board but the comptrollers 
proposal would allow him to appoint the panels members 
tese said recent allegations about a possible link between 
regans political fundraising apparatus and his official duties had 
nothing to do with cuomos renewed call to limit the comptrollers 
power 
regan has denied any wrongdoing
