a japanese bank will help the states small 
export businesses by offering leveraged loans under an unusual 
agreement announced wednesday

said stephen berger executive director of the port authority of 
new york and new jersey 
under the agreement the states job development authority will 
deposit 250000 into a daiwa bank interestearning cash collateral 
account that leverages or increases the deposit at a fourtoone 
ratio 
the resulting 1 million will be available for loans to smallto 
medium sized new york state export businesses the program will be 
administered by xport the port authoritys trading company and the 
first publicly owned international trading company in the nation 
the job development authority which now will have 25 million 
available for loans had been running out of money to lend to 
exporters who were unable to get the financing from regular banks 
the director of xport herbert ouida said the program is 
significant for the japanese because it should help alleviate some 
of the ill will felt toward japan because of the trade deficit

bob hope did his standup comedy routine in front 
of the worlds biggest microphone the heavily bugged us embassy 
in moscow for an appreciative audience unaccustomed to live 
entertainment 
about 300 members of the american community sat on blankets on a 
grassy field in the middle of the us embassy compound on a chilly 
moscow evening tuesday for the taping of a hope road show 
never mind that the latesetting sun played havoc with the 
cameras and delayed the taping or that an audio glitch forced 
brooke shields to perform her song twice or that temperatures had 
dipped so low into the 30s that by the time hope sang thanks for 
the memory his breath was visible 
the audience of embassy employees their families marines in 
dress uniforms and other americans didnt seem to care this was 
live not a monthold videotaped tv show mailed from the states or 
last years hit movie 
hope who turns 87 this month is only in moscow briefly as he 
takes his troupe to various us installations across europe 
today he was to view the world war ii victory day parade in red 
square visit landmark novodevichy cemetery and stop at the new 
moscow mcdonalds 
standing on a makeshift uso stage near the soontobe dismantled 
us embassy office building hope drew some of his biggest 
applause with jokes about extensive soviet electronic surveillance 
at the site a sore subject because of the millions of dollars it 
will cost to tear down and build a new embassy building 
what a shame that this new us embassy has to be destroyed 
because of all the listening devices hidden in it he said 
this place has so many bugs in it it should be known as the 
roach motel 
or im not saying this place is bugged but i looked at 
myself in the washroom mirror and said boy what a handsome guy 
and the mirror said thats funnier than any joke youll tell 
today 
us ambassador jack matlock asked at an embassy reception 
later if he had gotten tired of all the quips about the bugged 
embassy building replied its inevitable 
even the audience couldnt resist when miss shields stopped 
during her act and told the director she was hearing a strange 
sound some in the crowd shouted microwaves 
as the sun sank lower and the evening turned brisk hope praised 
the stalwart crowd for its endurance and adlibbed ive never 
played siberia before 
matlock thanking hope said sitting out here in the cold 
you can really see what were accustomed to 
hope shot back ive never worked to a blue audience 
the moscow segment of the show also featured songs by rosemary 
clooney and hopes wife delores and banter with miss universe 
1990 mona grudt of norway the nbc special to be shown on may 19 
will include the troupes stops at moscow templehof air force base 
in berlin and the berlin wall the royal air force base at

a battle over development on sensitive 
wetlands would be just another environmental dispute except that 
in this case the developer is the florida audubon society 
homeowners near the 340acre site in central florida oppose 
plans for a new audubon headquarters which is to include 20000 
square feet of office space 
residents complain the office would disrupt a forest preserve 
between two rivers and bring unwanted traffic and noise 
audubon officials defend the headquarters saying that since the 
society cannot pay competitive salaries it needs something to 
attract staff 
you have to make pragmatic decision said state audubon 
chairman leah schad to have a nice place for them to work in 
pleasing surroundings is certainly not a negative 
other environmentalists said audubon which calls itself the 
voice of conservation since 1900 should practice what it preaches 
we have lost over 50 percent of the wetlands in this 
country said sharon carveth who heads the sierra clubs central 
florida chapter we need to reverse that trend 
the homeowners association in the adjacent sabal point 
subdivision is asking for a vote on the development said member 
ervin england 
another issue clouding the project is how audubon obtained the 
tract 
the land was set aside as a preserve a decade ago by nts 
development co in exchange for permission to build sabal point 
the property was given to audubon last year at the same time 
nts was seeking permission to build another subdivision on 
sensitive land audubon supported that development 
ms schad said the land gift was absolutely not a factor in 
the societys support

political power and billions of dollars are at 
stake in a battle over which final census numbers will be better 
the raw or the cooked the actual count or one adjusted for people 
who were probably missed 
its an argument thats been obscured by the early problems 
plaguing the census count 
but a year from now the question of adjusting the results 
of the census could be the center of a crucial and bitter debate 
among the states and cities in congress and in the courts 
they cant beat us out so they want to count us out john 
d rogers a republican floor leader in the kentucky senate 
charged in a letter to the commerce department 
democrats and other advocates for minorities see the refusal to 
adjust as a method of disenfranchising their voters 
new york city mayor david dinkins charged that the undercount of 
minorities will cost cities hundreds of millions of dollars and 
many seats in congress 
they have gotten away with statistical malfeasance for 200 
years and figure they can get away with it for another 10 
dinkins said 
a decision against adjustment is a decision against a more 
accurate census javier p guajardo an assistant attorney 
general in texas wrote the commerce department 
a decision against a more accurate census is a decision 
against fair representation of the american public in particular 
those who need to be counted most minorities the poor and the 
homeless 
the sides already are staking out their positions in terms of 
language with opponents referring to adjustment as fiddling 
with the numbers while those in favor prefer the term 
correcting the count 
rep thomas c sawyer dohio who heads the house subcommittee 
that supervises the census seems to be leaning toward the idea of 
adjustment 
when the billions are spent and the counting is all done will 
we know how many americans there are he was asked 
i hope so when we add in the known error sawyer said 
the question is will we take that into account 
the time he said may have come when the nation is just too 
large for current methods of counting 
we may be seeing the point where we need to consider more 
modern statistical methods to bring the basic numbers closer to the 
truth 
why adjust the census 
because it isnt perfect 
the bureau has never claimed it could count everyone 
in 1980 a bureau analysis estimated that 14 percent of the 
population was missed but the error wasnt uniform 
most white middleclass folks got counted while the poor and 
minorities were more likely to be missed young black men were 
undercounted by as much as 6 percent officials have estimated 
a decade ago the decision on adjustment was left to the census 
bureau statisticians there decided they werent confident enough 
in their methods to make changes in the final numbers 
by 1987 many census workers thought an adjustment could and 
should be made in 1990 
the commerce department stepped in and in late 1987 ruled that 
no adjustment would be made in 1990 the ruling cited statistical 
questions and contended that adjustment would erode confidence in 
the census 
barbara bailar who headed the census office studying 
adjustment resigned 
some politicians and officials charged the decision was 
political because the minorities who are undercounted are more 
likely to be democrats 
a group of local governments led by new york city filed suit 
that suit was settled with a promise by the commerce department 
to reconsider but was later reinstated 
the commerce department has set a group of criteria that will be 
used to make a decision by july 15 1991 several months after the 
numbers have to be delivered to state and local governments for 
reapportionment 
those criteria opponents argued in reinstating their lawsuit 
are so stringent that they virtually prohibit adjustment 
if a decision is eventually made to adjust it will not be until 
mid1991 
because the first census reports will come out dec 31 that 
means there would be two sets of numbers providing easily 
identifiable winners and losers 
the fact that there is a limited amount of money and only 435 
seats in the house of representatives means that every gain by one 
state requires a loss by another 
while the 1990 census will likely mean movement of a dozen or so 
house seats from one state to another the difference between raw 
and adjusted numbers should affect only two to four seats sawyer 
said 
it will also mean a difference of billions of dollars in federal 
and state money distributed over the next 10 years based on 
population numbers 
university of wisconsin historian margo anderson author of a 
book on the history of the census said the framers of the 
constitution knew that the orderly transfer of political 
representation is always disruptive to some groups or interests in 
society 
the test of the new methods is not whether they are 
disruptive but whether they are fair she said adding that the 
departments guidelines for adjustment conjure up an idealized 
history the notion of a 200year process of enumeration which 
cannot be tampered with 
in fact she noted census methods have changed radically over 
the centuries 
the premise that the actual enumeration is the best count 
possible has no factual support john w tukey of princeton 
university told the department 
the census bureau launched its effort to count the estimated 250 
million americans in late march a project expected to take the 
rest of the year 
the tally was embroiled in controversy from the start with 
millions of forms misaddressed 
the public response was less than the bureau had hoped the 
effort has moved to a doortodoor count but that will cost 
considerably more than if people had all received their forms and 
mailed them back

a neglected piece of land next to the 
crumbling berlin wall has become the focus of controversy over how 
to rebuild what once was the center of a vibrant capital 
it is the spot on potsdamer platz one of europes most elegant 
squares before world war ii that the giant daimlerbenz wants to 
erect a new headquarters 
fears have grown in both west and east berlin that the shopping 
spree for land is about to start and that large rich western 
companies will determine the citys future landscape 
what berlin does not need is quick projects thought up in an 
illusory and shortlived reunification euphoria east berlin 
architect bruno flierl said in an interview 
one of east berlins chief planners has expressed concern about 
possible economic colonialism by the west 
after much internal bickering the west berlin city council has 
agreed to take competitive bids in july for a contract to rebuild 
the former central district 
east berlin will play a role in the decisions only after the 
election may 6 of its first democratically chosen city council 
this has caused complaints that east berliners will have little 
time to study documents affecting their part of the city 
since the berlin wall was built in 1961 potsdamer platz on one 
western side of it and neighboring leipziger platz on the other 
have been desolate symbols of a divided country 
together they had been the hub of berlin and one of europes 
busiest districts that ended with the destruction of world war ii 
the citys division and the building of the wall 
since the wall began falling in november potsdamer platz has 
become a major pedestrian crossing point motor vehicles use a 
newly completed section of fourlane highway linking east berlin 
with streets in the west that were dead ends for a generation 
makeshift souvenir stands in potsdamer platz sell chunks of the 
wall and soviet military uniforms to tourists circus tents and 
vans have sprouted on nearby land that is empty most of the year 
construction of an apartment block on leipziger platz was halted 
last fall when demonstrations and protest ended 40 years of 
stalinist rule 
an east german border guard said the work stopped when hopes 
were aroused that the area might become the center of the city 
again not just another place to build housing complexes 
he said the west german chain store wertheim planned to put its 
head office on the foundation of the unbuilt apartment house 
asked how he felt about western companies taking choice sites 
he shrugged and said of the planners i just hope they leave us 
some green spaces 
other east germans feel more strongly 
it would be unfair if all the hightech went to west berlin 
while the east was used for cheap production and storage 
facilities said guenther stahn east berlins ranking planners 
that would be a colonialist concept 
west berlins social democratic party wants to attract 
investment to the city as quickly as possible and has welcomed the 
daimlerbenz plan to build a headquarters for 8000 employees 
we cant afford to keep such an investor waiting mayor 
walter momper of west berlin told his city council recently 
the alternative list coalition partner of the social democrats 
in the council does not agree and said in a statement daimler 
is not the star around which potsdamer platz plans revolve 
representatives of the alternative list the equivalent in west 
berlin of the environmentalist greens party say the daimler 
building would be too dominant in the square they also argue 
against a company that makes armaments occupying such a prime site 
if construction of the headquarters goes forward as intended in 
1992 the alternative list demands it house a permanent exhibition 
on the role of the concern during the nazi years and on the 
possibility of converting arms production to peaceful uses 
west berlin council members agreed in april on the basic outline 
of future plans for the city including priority treatment of 
public transport and provision of open green spaces 
they did not give daimler a firm commitment but said they and 
the new east berlin council elected in may would consider it

the presence of plutonium in a lake 40 
miles downstream from a government weapons plant shows that the 
department of energy has been lax in running the facility an 
environmentalist said tuesday 
doe officials at oak ridge where parts for nuclear weapons are 
manufactured described the plutonium pollution in watts bar lake 
as very small they said it may have come from radioactive 
releases decades ago and isnt a health risk 
plutonium one of the deadliest substances known to man is an 
element used in nuclear weapons fuel watts bar lake is downstream 
from both the tennessee river and the clinch river which drains 
the oak ridge site 
clayton gist of the does environmental protection division in 
oak ridge said tuesday that plutonium can be found in sediment 
under the lake and in some instances is suspended in the water 
he said the level of plutonium is one tenthousandths the amount 
doe considers a health risk 
but ralph hutchinson of the center for global sustainability an 
environmental group said any level of plutonium is cause for 
concern 
i think there are real questions about how well doe has 
protected the public said 
the does findings of pollutants in watts bar including cesium 
and mercury were issued earlier this year as part of an ongoing 
survey of the environmental impact on and around the oak ridge 
installation said doe spokesman steve wyatt 
the bottom line on these reports is that this preliminary 
analysis indicates no imminent danger to the population wyatt 
said he said detailed analyses of the environment around oak ridge 
are done continually 
there are discharges of radioactive material from the site 
theres no question about that wyatt said these discharges 
primarily took place in the early days in the late 1940s 50s and 
early 60s some of the things ive seen make it sound like there 
was a leak last friday thats not true we arent talking 
about a current practice 
the oak ridge plant was built as part of the manhattan project 
which produced the first atomic bombs during world war ii 
gist said some of the plutonium may be circulating from the 
bottom sediments and in some cases may been leaching out of old 
landfills on the doe reservation 
the doe has been cleaning up those old landfills for several 
years he said 
ralph brooks manager of the tennessee valley authoritys water 
resources division said water supplies should not be affected 
by the plutonium 
he said plutonium has been identified in watts bar since at 
least 1983 we are even more concerned now to find the plutonium 
may be more widespread than we thought he said 
the oak ridge site has been placed on the national superfund 
list of hazardous waste sites targeted for cleanup

in this dusty town near 
the haitian border thousands of supporters dance and wave red 
flags as the frail blind president steps from a helicopter for yet 
another campaign stop 
at 82 joaquin balaguer is running for a fifth term in the 
dominican republics election a week from today it could be his 
last hurrah 
the conservative leaders chief opponent is juan bosch 80 the 
leftist former president who has lost three elections to balaguer 
but this time is favored to win he has led by 10 points in opinion 
polls over the past year 
they have been political rivals for decades and once again the 
contest for president is between them 
balaguer a conservative has served a total of four terms as 
president 
eight candidates are in the field but the election has been 
seen as a final contest between two men whose names have been 
synonymous with politics for half a century in this caribbean 
nation of 7 million people that shares the island of hispaniola 
with haiti 
despite his age and blindness induced by glaucoma balaguer has 
whisked around the country by helicopter in an active campaign 
thousands of supporters waved red flags of his social christian 
reformist party when balaguer stopped at elias pina during a recent 
campaign stop 
balaguer is revered in the town as the man who built 
pastelcolored apartment houses for the peasants who grow coffee 
and cacao in the valley below 
i love him he is the best president and he must win again 
said agripina diaz medina eight months pregnant who trotted 
behind the presidential motorcade 
for many dominicans elsewhere professor bosch as the 
selfeducated poet historian and novelist is known is the true 
spokesman of the people 
professor bosch is the only man who cares about the countrys 
poor and today we the poor are the majority said antonio 
gonzalez a supporter interviewed outside boschs dominican 
liberation party headquarters in santo domingo the capital 
after 16 years in office including three consecutive fouryear 
terms balaguers popularity has declined with the economy 
balaguer began a 2 billion public works program after 
reelection in 1986 critics say he has financed it by printing 
money and has neglected public services 
among the results are inflation of 50 percent a year currency 
devaluations and electricity blackouts 
bosch campaigned as a moderate who would promote a freemarket 
economy and good relations with the united states but his 
opponents have portrayed him as a dangerous leftist 
at a recent luncheon of the american chamber of commerce in 
santo domingo bosch was asked about his ideology 
in the process of explaining that he was a marxist but not a 
communist bosch paused for 19 seconds as if trying to gather his 
thoughts 
video cameras recorded it and the scene was used in a balaguer 
television commercial with the announcer saying a man who 
thinks like that cant govern the country then the slogan 
balaguer a road without danger appeared on the screen 
antonio ocana an architect and longtime associate said bosch 
has memory lapses like everybody but he has no problems with his 
reasoning we should be worried about having a blind president who 
doesnt know what documents he is signing 
in 1963 bosch became the countrys first freely elected 
president after the assassination of gen rafael trujillo a 
dictator whose rule spanned 31 years bosch spent most of that time 
in cuba and is a close friend of fidel castro who gained power in 
1959 
after seven months in office bosch was overthrown and jailed by 
leaders of the military who accused him of being a communist a 
civil war followed and in 1965 soldiers supporting bosch seemed 
about to win 
president lyndon b johnson sent in 23000 marines they stayed 
a year until an election won by balaguer a former trujillo aide 
ranked third and fourth in the polls for the may 16 presidential 
election are jose francisco pena gomez a former santo domingo 
mayor and former vice president jacobo majluta who was president 
for more than a month in 1982 after president antonio guzman 
committed suicide 
pena gomez 52 and majluta 55 both belonged to the socialist 
dominican revolutionary party until late last year when fights 
over party leadership caused majluta to leave and form the 
independent revolutionary party 
majluta ran only 40000 votes behind balaguer in 1986 
about 32 million dominicans are registered to vote for 120 
representatives 30 senators 104 mayors and 550 councilmen from 18 
registered parties former president jimmy carter is among the 
foreign observers

thousands of acres were burning out of 
control tuesday in michigans lower peninsula destroying at least 
50 houses prompting evacuations and injuring a firefighter state 
officials said 
the blaze began about 330 pm jumped the au sable river and 
extended northeast to engulf between 1500 and 2000 acres said 
john macgregor deputy director of the state department of natural 
resources office in crawford county 
about 250 to 350 people in a 14squaremile area were evacuated 
including those who lost their homes as wind gusts of more than 20 
mph fanned the flames northeast at nearly 4 mph authorities said 
were evacuating the whole area said lt mike johnson of 
the crawford county sheriffs department weve got high wind and 
we cant control it were calling in everyone we can to help 
bill mahalak dnr action regional forest manager said the 
flames destroyed at least 50 homes ronald wilson dnr chief for 
resource protection in lansing said at least 2000 acres are 
burning 
a fire base was set up about seven miles east of grayling as 
firefighters poured in from across the region and from parts of the 
upper peninsula said john macgregor deputy director of the dnr 
office in crawford county 
high winds and looming thunderstorms hampered firefighting

federal regulators are cutting prices to speed 
the sale of property held by failed savings and loans but they aim 
to avoid fire sales that could spook fragile real estate markets 
its a fine line that has to be walked white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said in putting the administration 
behind the steppedup sale of sampl real estate without endorsing the 
details of policy changes adopted by regulators tuesday 
the board of the resolution trust corp agreed to allow its 
managers to cut prices by 15 percent if a property goes unsold for 
six months or four months for singlefamily homes 
a further reduction of 5 percent will be allowed after an 
additional three months a second policy adopted tuesday authorizes 
auction sales allowing no more than a 30 percent discount from 
appraised value 
the rtc at the end of february owned 164 billion in real 
estate and was expecting its portfolio to mushroom as it 
repossessed property posted as collateral for delinquent loans it 
had sold about 21 billion worth 
a treasury departmentled panel overseeing the rtcs work urged 
regulators in a letter to attack the backlog more aggressively 
we would encourage you to allow asset managers to depart from 
appraised values more quickly and by greater percentages said 
william taylor the oversight boards chief staff officer 
however at the white house fitzwater acknowledged the concerns 
of real estate professionals who warn that dumping properties 
may sink shaky markets 
we obviously dont want to wreck the economy he said but 
at the same time we obviously want to get these properties 
disposed of 
the congressional joint economic committee said tuesday that the 
governments thriftrelated spending in 1990 could total 45 
billion 
the faster the repossessed property is sold the less likely it 
is to deteriorate and the lower the governments management costs 
weve become convinced that holding on to property is too 
costly both for us and the taxpayer and what were adopting is 
designed to move properties without disrupting markets rtc 
chairman l william seidman said 
private economists said real estate investors worried about 
dumping may be underestimating the negative effect on prices of the 
large backlog of unsold parcels 
over the last several months even in depressed markets there 
is less concern about dumping and more recognition of the danger of 
overhang said university of houston professor paul m horvitz 
the new sales proposal originally came before the rtc board two 
weeks ago but the board delayed action at the urging of 
comptroller of the currency robert clarke who regulates nationally 
chartered banks clarke said he feared faster sales could hurt 
stillsolvent banks and sampls struggling with deteriorating real 
estate portfolios 
however clarke said an analysis by the rtcs staff convinced 
him the new policy would have little effect on solvent institutions 
weve satisfied ourselves that as far as we can tell and you 
can never tell for sure adoption of this policy would not have an 
adverse effect on any of the institutions not in receivership he 
said 
in a related development the rtc said it has hired a miami 
firm auction company of america to hold an unprecedented auction 
of 200 million to 300 million worth of commercial properties 
each with a value of 1 million regulators anticipate holding the 
auction in late summer

harry truman would be appalled by 
presidential politics if he were alive today coanchor jim lehrer 
of the macneillehrer newshour says and he wouldnt be pleased 
with journalists either 
he would be outraged at the way presidents are elected at the 
political campaign process that opens in the mud and closes in the 
gutter lehrer said tuesday he would be appalled that 
candidates are graded on how they handle questions rather than how 
or whether they answer 
lehrer accepted the harry s truman good neighbor award on 
behalf of partner robert macneil for the newshour now in its 
14th season on public television 
the award has been given annually since 1973 on trumans 
birthday other recipients have included former president ford dr 
jonas salk sen barry goldwater and sen howard baker 
lehrer said he believes truman would be upset about the turns 
journalism has taken 
he would be appalled at how somebody named marla maples is 
made a national celebrity by the press simply because she had a 
relationship with a married millionaire named donald trump he 
said

a jury nearly doubled the amount sought by 
singer tom waits after finding that fritolay inc had used the 
soul of his gravelly voice to peddle corn chips 
the jury tuesday ordered fritolay to pay waits almost 25 
million for imitating his voice in a radio commercial waits had 
asked for 15 million 
now i have a fence and a gate around my voice said waits 
40 who has turned down all offers to do commercials 
this was a humiliation to mr waits they picked on the wrong 
guy said waits attorney howard king 
waits songs are offbeat paeans to gritty life at the margin 
describing nighthawks at the diner truck drivers hard drinkers 
and prostitutes in dingy worlds filled with cigarette smoke he 
also has appeared in such films as rumble fish and cotton 
club 
fritolay attorney anthony liebig had argued waits wasnt 
wellknown enough to be imitated 
there is no question he is widely known to extreme insiders in 
the rock industry but that has nothing to do with being known by 
the broader segment of the population liebig said 
waits sued fritolay and ad agency tracylocke inc which hired 
stephen carter to sing in ads for salsa rio doritos in 1988

excerpts from oliver norths notebooks linking 
him to george bush apparently never got to capitol hill and 
investigations may be warranted says the former chairman of the 
house irancontra committee 
portions of the diaries released tuesday renew questions about 
whether thenvice president bush was more deeply involved in 
assisting the nicaraguan contra rebels than he has acknowledged 
one entry suggests north met with bush a few hours after the 
national security council aide lied to the house intelligence 
committee on aug 6 1986 by testifying that he wasnt supplying 
military aid to the contras 
after meeting with the committee north fielded a complaint 
about felix rodriguez a former cia operative working in norths 
resupply network rodriguez is a longtime friend of donald gregg 
then a national security adviser and now ambassador to south korea 
the complaint about rodriguez is followed by a notebook entry 
suggesting that north met with gregg according to the newly 
released excerpts gregg maintains he didnt find out about norths 
involvement in the network until aug 8 1986 and that he didnt 
tell bush about it until december 1986 after the irancontra affair 
had become public 
rep lee hamilton dind who led the houses irancontra 
inquiry said he didnt believe congress had seen the north 
notebook entries referring to aug 6 meetings with bush and gregg 
it clearly at the very least would raise questions which ought 
to have been put at the time to appropriate witnesses hamilton 
said i would have if i had seen them 
if there is evidence relevant diaries were withheld redacted 
edited or blacked out then i would want the house intelligence 
or judiciary committees to conduct an investigation he said 
i would expect the same of the independent counsel he 
added referring to the irancontra prosecutors office 
north turned over heavily censored portions of his notebooks in 
1987 and the white house released many of those to congress for its 
irancontra probe but full copies werent provided to the 
government until north was forced to give them to prosecutors at 
his trial last year he retains the original notebooks 
the 1400 pages of newly released entries were obtained by a 
private research organization the national security archive as 
the result of a lawsuit filed against the government intelligence 
agencies still are reviewing the remaining 1200 pages of norths 
diaries 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the vice 
presidents role in the irancontra affair was completely examined 
in the congressional inquiry and we have nothing to add 
in the newly released notebook entries north details efforts to 
persuade central american countries to support the contras 
a 3rd country solicitation plan lists a planned central 
american trip that bush in fact did take to the inauguration of 
honduran president jose azcona hoyo 
the reagan administration had an elaborate plan to induce third 
countries to support the contras according to evidence introduced 
at norths trial last year bush has denied being involved in any 
quid pro quo arrangements providing additional economic and 
military aid to honduras in exchange for that countrys support of 
the contras 
other jottings in norths notebooks 
thendeputy national security adviser john poindexter said 
deception is required in whatever plan we develop for dealing w 
with nicaragua according to norths notebooks for dec 5 
1984 poindexters comment referred to the contadora peace process 
involving central american nations 
there was active surveillance on subject near the national 
theater in washington dc according to a june 10 1986 diary 
entry peter kornbluh of the national security archive said the 
period marked a time of paranoia at the white house because of 
news stories suggesting norths involvement in a contra resupply 
operation during the congressional military aid ban 
president reagan does not have enough confidence in 
secretary of state george shultz to accept his input or to 
include him in operational advice north records in a nov 17 
1986 meeting days before the irancontra affair became public 
the meeting was with alton keel deputy director of the national 
security council

flight attendants are asking federal 
authorities to give them more protection against the daytoday 
hazards of working on airliners 
cosmic radiation air pollution jet engine noise tobacco 
smoke long working hours and unwieldy beverage carts all pose 
hazards to airliner crews the association of flight attendants 
said in a formal petition tuesday 
the 30000member union asked the federal aviation 
administration to adopt the same standards that protect most other 
workers under the occupational safety and health act 
they really only care about our safety when it comes to 
keeping us alive in a crash so the passengers can be evacuated 
said matthew finucane the unions director of air safety and 
health 
the union accused the faa of preempting osha from protecting 
the aviation work place but of failing itself to guard flight 
attendants and other crew members against disease and injury in the 
sky 
faa spokesman bob buckhorn said the agency had received the 
petition and would review it 
we feel our cabin safety program is very successful said 
buckhorn he said improvements have been made to reduce noise 
levels set flammability standards and install smoke detectors and 
changes are being worked out in duty hour requirements 
buckhorn said seminars are planned to assess and deal with the 
radiation hazard 
a transportation department study in february estimated that 
cosmic radiation could cause one cancer death among 100 crew 
members flying for 20 years airliner occupants are exposed to 
higher radiation from space because there is less atmosphere to 
shield them 
the faa has drafted a circular warning of possible radiation 
danger to crew members who fly long highaltitude routes 
repeatedly over a long period 
the flight attendants petition says poorly designed beverage 
and food carts weighing 200 pounds or more cause about one injury a 
day on us flights 
it says some flight attendants suffer from carpal tunnel 
syndrome which spokesman finucane described as a wrist ailment 
caused by repeatedly subjecting the wrist to awkward positions and 
stress 
finucane said the union has no readily available data on how 
many flight attendants have suffered disease or injury 
crew members are denied certain rights that are guaranteed 
workers in other workplaces union president susan bianchisand 
said in a letter to faa administrator james busey 
it is important not to ignore daytoday occupational health 
and safety issues since cancer can kill as well as crashes said 
ms bianchisand 
the faa deals extensively with aviation safety but has no office 
to oversee crew health she said buckhorn said both passenger and 
crew health issues are handled by cabin safety experts 
the aflcio has called for broader osha protections to include 
transportation workers state and local government employees and 
agricultural workers not covered by the 20yearold act

house democrats are moving ahead with a bill 
guaranteeing unpaid leave to workers for family emergencies despite 
a threatened veto by president bush 
the white house reaffirmed its opposition to the family and 
medical leave act tuesday as the house scheduled a vote on the bill 
for today 
i hope the president will reconsider that said house 
speaker thomas foley dwash i believe after the legislation has 
been passed and the president has a chance to reflect on its 
importance to families and preserving the family as an institution 
the president will sign the bill 
the bill has republican and democratic support backers said 
they believe they have enough votes to win passage in the house but 
are short of the twothirds necessary to override a veto should it 
also pass the senate 
bushs veto threat established a clear division between 
congressional democrats and the president on the second of two 
major familyoriented bills before congress this year a broader 
bill establishing major new spending to help poor and middleincome 
families with child care costs awaits resolution of house and 
senate differences and also faces a veto threat 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater reiterated a veto threat 
made a day earlier by chief of staff john sununu and said the white 
house believes the bill would drive up unemployment 
he said bush supports companies providing parental leaves 
voluntarily but is unwilling to force them to do it 
at one point in his daily news briefing fitzwater suggested 
that workers look for other jobs if they or their unions could 
not negotiate parental leave with their employer 
he later backed off that suggestion but one of the sponsors 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo stood on the house floor later to 
denounce fitzwaters comment 
theres a profamily administration for you she said if 
anyone knows where those jobs are please ring the white house 
labor secretary elizabeth dole said she would recommend bush 
veto the bill she said the bill provides no flexibility no 
freedom of choice just do it 
foley called it a very moderate bill because it provides 
only for unpaid leave with job protection with no requirement for 
paid benefits 
rep marge roukema of new jersey the leading republican 
sponsor said she wanted to meet with bush about the bill and urged 
him not to veto it without hearing from republican supporters 
common decency requires that we set up this minimum standard 
of job security she said i believe the president will have an 
open ear and open heart on this 
roukema blasted washingtonbased business lobbyists as 
creating a scare campaign against the bill that she asserted was 
out of step with what most businesses were willing to offer their 
employees 
the bill is opposed by business groups including the us 
chamber of commerce 
it would require employers with 50 or more workers to offer 
unpaid time off with job and benefit protection for the care of 
newborn newly adopted or seriously ill children as well as to 
deal with personal health problems or ill spouses or parents 
an employee returning from leave would have to be restored to 
his or her previous job or an equivalent position employers would 
have to continue health insurance benefits for those on leave 
the bill approved by house committees would require leaves of 10 
to 15 weeks depending on circumstances but sponsors said they 
were agreeing to a proposed substitute setting a single category of 
leave of up to 12 weeks for care for a new child or sick spouse 
child or parent or for the employees own illness it also would 
cover federal workers and congressional staffs

the federal election commission is 
investigating three related arizona companies and at least two of 
their officers for allegedly making illegal donations to the 
republican party and bush presidential campaign 
the agencys actions were disclosed in documents filed monday in 
us district court in phoenix seeking a court order to force the 
companies to surrender certain financial records the agency as a 
rule refuses to comment on current investigations 
the fecs filing said the investigation began late last year and 
that a former employee told the agency the two officers were 
reimbursed with corporate funds after making donations to the gop 
and bush campaign the agency also said corporate letterhead and 
postage may have been used to solicit donations on behalf of the 
bush campaign 
information suggests that respondents made corporate 
contributions to federal candidates disguised as contributions 
made in other names and used corporate funds to solicit 
contributions to federal candidates the fec said 
the companies all with headquarters at the same address in 
scottsdale ariz are the national association of real estate 
appraisers the national association of review appraisers and 
mortgage underwriters and the international association managers 
individuals named in the complaint are robert johnson executive 
director of the groups and e kenneth twichell managing director 
of the national association of real estate appraisers 
johnson in a telephone interview denied any wrongdoing and 
said he had provided fec attorneys all requested documents 
johnson said he never reimbursed himself twichell or any other 
employees for political donations or used corporate letterhead for 
fundraising he said fec lawyers had refused to provide him with 
any evidence of the allegations or name the former employee who 
made the allegations 
i believe this investigation is bordering on harassment he 
said 
the fec the court papers say voted unanimously that there was 
reason to believe johnson and twichell were reimbursed with 
corporate funds after making political donations that would 
violate laws prohibiting corporate donations and making 
contributions in the name of another 
the court papers also allege that twichell sent at least one and 
possibly several letters to members of the organizations soliciting 
donations for the bush campaign using corporate letterhead and 
postage for such a campaign would violate prohibitions against 
corporate expenses or donations on behalf of federal candidates 
twichell is out of the country his office said tuesday 
the court papers provide few specific details of the alleged 
illegal donations 
fec records show that johnson made two donations totaling 
12000 to the republican national committee in june 1988 he also 
gave 2000 to the bush campaign 
twichell according to fec records donated 1000 to the bush 
campaign in january 1988 and 10000 in july of that year to the 
rnc

in an interview tuesday at his midmanhattan apartment as he peered 
characteristically over reading glasses 
that meal he said in his autobiography i swear to this day 
gave me my initial unquenchable interest in food and food 
preparation 
claiborne 69 published his first book the new york times 
cookbook in 1961 four years after he became the newspapers 
first male food editor 
he expected to sell around 15000 books he slept little always 
expecting a call in the middle of the night from an irate cook 
trying to make the macaroni and cheese on page 152 and it doesnt 
work 
eventually 3 million copies were sold and the book has become 
a dogeared authoritative companion to fannie farmer or joy of 
cooking in many kitchens 
this time 20 books later he has become one of the nations 
most influential food writers and is sleeping nights despite 
publication of an extensively revised edition of the new york 
times cookbook harper amp row 25 
when i first joined the times the ultimate thing in food was 
french cooking and the ultimate dish was pike quenelles in 
lobster sauce he said there was just one japanese restaurant in 
manhattan 
the new book was the result of a revolution in food 
back in those days no one ever heard of a pesto sauce or 
sundried tomatoes and the only mustard was ballpark mustard he 
said americans thought tuna came out of a can and that was it 
balsamic vinegar one of the greatest additions to american 
culture where food is concerned arrived from italy 
all sorts of salad greens regional american thai vietnamese 
food 
and california cuisine if you could tell me what that is 
thank you he said with a smirk 
there have been other changes such as the food processor it 
was a gadget claiborne in 1972 predicted never would go over with 
american consumers 
one takes up some of the tiny bit of counter space in 
claibornes manhattan kitchen which has just a twoburner gas 
stove and a small convection oven one wall is covered with copper 
pots and iron pans and two telephones 
a head of cabbage a few red potatoes two tomatoes and some 
onions sat on the counter but claiborne said he rarely cooks 
there preferring his 5000squarefoot home in easthampton on 
long island 
it was in that professionalquality kitchen where he tested 
recipes for his new book 
claiborne and his editor joan whitman attacked the first book 
weeding out the likes of frankfurter goulash cutting some fats and 
salt and adding more pasta and asian dishes fresh tuna and a 
black olive puree for pasta forty percent of the recipes are new 
many old standards even some with beef or butter or both 
remain at a recent book signing he said a rather frantic woman 
ran up to ask if herbal meatloaf had made the cut it had he was 
relieved 
claiborne himself however has for 10 years after a diagnosis 
of high blood pressure restricted his fat and salt i follow the 
basic guidelines but i give myself latitude 
breakfast is nearly always juice and yogurt lunch almost 
always is fresh tomato soup recipe page 72 of the new book 
toast gorgonzola cheese and panforte and dinner is pasta a 
hamburger or a dish such as wiener schnitzel 
his next project he said is a book on table manners and 
settings for use professionally and in the home admittedly 
opinionated on the matter he cites all manner of violations he has 
witnessed 
on an airline it drives me crazy when they say would you 
care for wine or champagne they should say still wine or 
champagne or table candles with the flame at eye level waiters 
who touch the rim of a glass table settings that are not strictly 
uniform 
i have seen educated adults pick their teeth at the table 
he said

president bush appears to have concluded that 
economycrippling budget cuts pose a greater political threat to 
republicans than a broken no new taxes campaign promise 
bush has changed positions over the years or at least shown 
flexibility on a range of topics from abortion rights to 
arms control to dealing with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
to global warming 
however few pledges have been etched as keenly in recent 
political consciousness as bushs 1988 read my lips no new 
taxes assertion and even as recently as last month bush was 
telling republican audiences he would resist democratic efforts to 
raise taxes 
republican candidates clearly are squirming over the notion of 
tax increases in an election year im not going to vote for 
anything which causes us to lose politically said assistant 
house republican leader newt gingrich of georgia 
but white house strategists apparently decided that the economic 
fallout from massive budget cuts resulting from a failure to 
reach a budget compromise could be an even bigger political 
liability 
so having first put democrats in a box by continually accusing 
them of seeking to raise taxes bush had little choice but to take 
the initiative on tax increases himself 
he did that this week with his no preconditions budget talks 
overture to congress followed by sessions with lawmakers that 
included the first serious exploration of tax options in his 
presidency 
at the same time budget director richard darman was dispatched 
to capitol hill to deliver bad news 
a sluggish economy and previous underestimates of the cost of 
the savings and loan bailout will mean the government may miss 
deficit targets by 60 billion to 100 billion this fall darman 
told lawmakers on tuesday 
although darman suggested that a 100 billion shortfall was an 
extreme case the underlying message was clear 
few close to the budget process in washington have any illusions 
that 60 billion to 100 billion can be whacked from the budget 
through belttightening alone 
and yet if some mix of spending cuts and higher taxes cant be 
assembled and enacted acrosstheboard spending cuts in defense 
and most domestic programs will take place on oct 1 thats the 
start of the new fiscal year and just a month before 1990 
congressional elections 
although some programs would be exempt such as social security 
benefits and interest payments on the national debt the impact of 
such cuts throughout the government could have a crippling effect 
on an already fragile economy 
darman has estimated that cuts of over 20 percent could result 
by contrast when acrosstheboard cuts took effect last year when 
congress failed to meet deficit targets the cuts amounted to less 
than 5 percent 
the grammrudman budget balancing law requires the federal 
deficit now expected to swell to near 200 billion this year to 
be reduced to 100 billion during the current fiscal year and to 
64 billion by next year 
the white house after opening the door to tax increases is now 
trying to close it just enough to minimize political damage 
thus darman said that while bush is open to discuss any 
proposal there are some ideas were not prepared to put on the 
table 
however democratic leaders are suggesting that the president 
had better spell out just what kind of taxes he can support if he 
expects to win their cooperation in forging a serious bipartisan 
compromise 
budget summits between the white house and congress have taken 
place before but they have produced few concrete results 
this year may be different because of the seriousness with which 
bush is approaching the issue and the magnitude of the deficit 
problem suggests former rep thomas ashley dohio 
i think there is a greater prospect of deliverability on both 
sides this year ashley said last year i dont think either 
the white house or congress was in a position to attack the 
politically sensitive issues 
ashley a former member of the house budget committee who speaks 
regularly with bush said deficit cuts such as those required this 
year cannot be achieved without new taxes 
is bush really ready to abandon his campaign pledge and support 
some form of tax increase ashley said yes 
one thing is clear the white house is not saying everything 
is on the table because it has a ring to it they have to be 
willing to deal he said

shai gross vividly recalls those 
terrifying moments as a sixyearold hostage crouching beneath his 
mothers dress to hide from armed hijackers who commandeered an air 
france jetliner to africa 
a week later gross and his parents were among the 102 
passengers rescued in a legendary israeli commando raid at entebbe 
airport uganda on july 4 1976 three hostages and an israeli 
soldier were killed in the raid 
his story is one of the dramatic accounts told tuesday night at 
a reunion of the more than 100 soldiers and former hostages 
involved in israels bold rescue of the civilian captives 
the gathering at a seaside hotel was called to launch a college 
scholarship fundraising drive in memory of lt col yonatan 
netanyahu the mission commander killed at age 30 in the raid 
i couldnt even cry said gross 20 now an air force 
technician referring to his memories of the eight days he spent at 
gunpoint i didnt know what struck me i had never before seen a 
grenade or a gun 
yitzhak rabin who was then prime minister compared the entebbe 
crisis to current efforts to free captives in lebanon 
my policy has been that when you have a hostage situation 
soldiers or civilians if theres a military option you use it if 
not then enter an exchange deal for that you have to have the 
cards rabin said 
despite us pressures on israel to free arab prisoners for 
hostages israel has conditioned any deal on the release of three 
israeli soldiers believed held captive by proiranian militants in 
lebanon 
rabin said planning and executing the entebbe rescue mission was 
a nervewracking affair 
i suffered more than a few stomachaches over that decision so 
many options were proposed and ruled out he said in the raid 
israeli aircraft flew 2400 miles to rescue the hostages and 
engaged ugandan troops in battle 
the hijacked air france flight carring 244 passenger and 12 
crew had originated in tel aviv it was commandeered by three 
terrorists after a stopover in athens on june 27 1976 the marxist 
popular front for the liberation of palestine claimed 
responsibility for the hijacking 
the aircraft was first taken to benghazi libya and then flown 
to entebbe nonisraeli passengers were freed and hijackers 
demanded the release of arab prisoners in exchange for the rest 
gross remembers that within minutes of commandeering the plane 
the hijackers a german woman and two arabs took children to the 
front of the plane 
he recalled his fear at the thought of separation what would 
they do to me he said my mother took me right away and hid me 
beneath her dress under the seat i sat there 2 hours 
petrified 
he said the rescue was also frightening since hostages were 
unaware at the first that the shooting they suddenly heard in the 
terminal to which they had been taken from the airplane was by 
israeli soldiers 
once troops burst into the building gross said i remember my 
father grabbed a mattress and covered me with it we were all sure 
we were going to be killed 
he said he had nightmares for months afterwards and shunned air 
travel i still dont like to tell these stories never 
the israeli rescue came within hours of the hijackers deadline 
and lasted 53 minutes on the ground it was planned in less than 40 
hours commanders said 
in an airport clash with ugandan troops the usborn netanyahu 
was shot and killed by a sniper in the control tower 
another israeli soldier was permanently paralyzed from the neck 
down by a gunshot wound sustained during a diversionary maneuver 
three hostages and all the hijackers were killed as well as 20 
ugandan guards a 75yearold hostage dora bloch had been 
hospitalized and was not with the hostages at the time of the raid 
she was later killed by ugandan secret police 
pilot amnon halivni who flew the hostages home in a c130 
hercules turboprop recalled the furious airport battle bullets 
flew everywhere it was a pyrotechnics such as ive never seen 
he said 
he said the pilots were concerned that all the hostages would 
not be able to board the aircraft for a quick takeoff 
we were worried some of them children would just run away 
frightened and how would we ever know if we had all of them 
halivni said

the bush administration is touting bolivias 
record levels of cocaine eradication even while acknowledging that 
the country is attaining greater prominence as an illegal narcotics 
center 
bolivia has moved up as a cocaineprocessing locale because 
traffickers are moving their operations from neighboring colombia 
where a fullscale crackdown has been in effect for many months 
assistant secretary of state bernard aronson said tuesday 
bolivian president jaime paz zamora pressed president bush on 
tuesday for more us antidrug money saying bolivia can do a 
better job on eradication said pazs economic counselor samuel 
doria medina 
we can eradicate more rapidly if there is more money doria 
said in an interview 
while his government likes the administrations 150 million 
economic aid package for next year paz in his meeting with bush 
mentioned that we can accelerate the program of substitution for 
coca leaves if we can have additional money said doria 
some of the aid is earmarked for a program under which farmers 
who agree to stop growing coca leaves are given an 800peracre 
credit for switching to another crop 
doria said the two governments agreed to set up a task force to 
look into the possibilities 
the bolivians eradicated 9100 acres of coca in the first four 
months of this year compared with 6200 acres in all of 1989 
aronson said they seized 35 tons of cocaine paste from january 
through april compared with 4 tons for all of last year 
asked whether the increased eradication was due to steppedup 
cocaine activity in bolivia aronson said it is possible and 
partly what youre seeing is that as the colombians crack down on 
the cartels and make life difficult for them in colombia some of 
them are moving their operations to brazil 
during the paz visit the two nations also agreed to sign a new 
trade and investment pact and a threeyear 60 million food aid 
program said aronson 
the united states also promised medical help for bolivia to 
suppress the insectcarried chagas disease aronson said 
as paz left the white house bush assured him in a brief speech 
you and your countrymen will not stand alone in the fight against 
cocaine or in the drive for economic development together were 
going to wage a strong fight 
bush also said that if current eradication efforts continue 
bolivia may be able to eliminate all coca grown within its border 
for illegal use 
aronson said some 99000 acres of coca crops still are growing 
in the countrys heaviest production area 
the bolivians stressed their need for alternative 
development to shift the economy from its cocaine dependence 
through creation of jobs income and foreign exchange 
paz told bush in departure remarks that his countrymen are 
fervent allies and we are ready to give you all of our efforts and 
all of our cooperation to everything that would be of a common 
interest 
the new trade and investment agreement is similar to one the 
united states has with mexico in which trade officials from both 
countries consult on issues such as problems us firms may have in 
trying to invest in bolivia or bolivian problems in trying to 
export to the united states said aronson 
the administration promised technical assistance against the 
widespread chagas disease which is carried by a kissing bug 
and is similar to african sleeping sickness

following in his fathers footsteps 
rafael angel calderon donned the presidential sash doffed by nobel 
laureate oscar arias then promised his countrymen fiscal vigilance 
and austerity 
exactly 50 years ago my father was sworn in before these same 
altars of god and the fatherland he told a crowd of 50000 
attending tuesdays ceremony at the national soccer stadium 
calderon outlined a government of national consensus in which 
private enterprise will be the motor of what he termed economic 
democracy 
but he also lamented the large federal budget deficit 6 
percent of the gnp and said austerity measures would have to be 
adopted during his first year in office to prevent a rise in 
inflation 
first lady barbara bush headed the us delegation to the 
inauguration seven heads of state including calderons four 
central american colleagues were on hand 
mrs bush thanked the people of costa rica for their warmth and 
hospitality before departing for washington on tuesday evening 
i have fallen in love with the people of costa rica and the 
calderon family especially the four children she said mrs 
bush had breakfast with the family before the inauguration ceremony 
calderon a 41yearold lawyer has been in politics since the 
age of 16 
he hailed arias work on behalf of peace in central america the 
outgoing president was awarded the 1987 nobel peace prize for 
authoring a plan that has promoted although not completely 
achieved peace in the region 
halfway down the road toward peace it is incumbent upon us 
the presidents of the region to go on to a new phase of the 
process in which the great goal will not be to silence the roar of 
the cannons but to finally lift ourselves toward economic 
development calderon said 
he quoted pope paul vi in saying that in modern times 
development is the new name for peace calderon said his 
government would encourage the creation of thousands of 
minienterprises many of them linked to costa ricas 
burgeoning tourism industry 
calderons party of social christian unity has accused arias 
social democratic national liberation party of fostering an 
oversized and inefficient state apparatus he vowed to impose 
order on public finances 
the social christians are slightly to the right of the social 
democrats the similarly centrist ideology of the two parties has 
been a major factor in keeping the nation of 3 million stable and 
democratic during decades of turmoil and totalitarianism in latin 
america 
there are economic world powers and military world powers we 
only aspire to consolidate ourselves as a world power of 
disarmament and human rights said calderon 
calderon who lost presidential bids in 1982 and 1986 defeated 
liberation candidate manuel castillo in a february election 
the constitution forbade arias whom polls gave a 90 percent 
approval rate at the end of his presidency from seeking another 
term 
calderon founded the social christian party in part to shed the 
legacy of his father rafael angel calderon guardia who was exiled 
in 1948 for trying to nullify the presidential vote that year 
after a 40day revolution the army was abolished and the 
calderon family sent into exile 
calderon calls his father who served as president from 1940 to 
1944 the greatest costa rican president of this century the elder 
calderon was a great social reformer having founded costa ricas 
social security system 
in his campaign calderon tried to take advantage of his 
fathers image as a reformer without raising the events of 1948

proposed tougher sentences for corporate 
criminals require more study before receiving justice department 
support but have not been abandoned attorney general dick 
thornburgh says 
the difference here was that there were not adequately 
reviewed they were not repudiated but were simply withdrawn for 
further study thornburgh told a senate judiciary committee 
hearing 
he promised to issue a toughminded recommendation on sentences 
for whitecollar criminals but said he had no deadline for doing so 
prosecution of crime in the suites has been a theme of 
thornburghs tenure at the justice department his aides 
acknowledged last month that he withdrew support for the guidelines 
at the request of the white house 
the request reportedly followed heavy lobbying by defense 
contractors oil companies and others who saw the proposals as 
something very much like a corporate death penalty for several 
firms 
the us sentencing commission produced the guidelines last 
fall they would require federal judges to impose stiff fines on 
companies convicted of polluting fraud and other whitecollar 
offenses 
sen edward m kennedy dmass said that when the justice 
department withdrew its support he was concerned that the 
department of justice has surrendered so easily to pressure from 
the white house and big business to go soft on whitecollar crime 
thornburgh declared that he is adamantly opposed to soft 
treatment for whitecollar criminals i stand second to none in 
pressing for nothing less than the maximum penalties that we can 
accommodate under the law he said 
sen howard m metzenbaum dohio said however that criminals 
who are members of the countryclub set frequently get off the 
hook your prosecutors are wheeling and dealing constantly 
without anyone going to the slammer he told thornburgh 
i think youd have a hard time explaining that to woody 
lemons thornburgh replied lemons the former chairman of a 
texas savings and loan was recently sentenced to 30 years in 
prison the stiffest sentence so far in the probe of massive fraud 
in the thrift industry 
thornburgh promised to get metzenbaum a list of whitecollar 
offenders who have been sentenced to prison i will hope to 
disabuse you of what is obviously a mistaken view he said

a jury found the dallas morning news did not set 
out to wreck its rival in obtaining 26 comics and features that had 
been running in the dallas times herald 
the harris county jury voted 102 on tuesday to reject the times 
heralds claim for at least 33 million in damages 
the times herald had contended the morning news and its parent 
the ah belo corp violated antitrust laws by taking over the 
features in a move to drive the times herald out of business 
the features which ran in the times herald until last fall 
included doonesbury the far side dear abby and erma bombeck 
times herald attorney wayne fisher said the newspaper will 
appeal 
we disagree that the conduct of our competitor was legal or 
proper in any way the paper said in a statement in fact it 
was wrong in many ways wrong morally wrong ethically wrong for 
the profession of journalism and wrong for dallas and its people 
belo chairman robert decherd said the most important thing 
now is for our two companies to go about making the best newspapers 
we can and benefit the communities we serve we feel strongly weve 
been vindicated 
decherd denied the morning news intended to drive the times 
herald out of business 
the dallas market can support two vibrant lively 
newspapers he said i still believe that 
the morning news said it obtained the comics and features as 
part of a joint venture with universal press syndicate inc of 
kansas city the distributor of the features to get into the tv 
programming business 
witnesses for belo and the syndicate testified that universal 
press required all its features in the times herald be moved to the 
morning news as part of the venture 
the venture will use syndicate comics characters in tv programs 
and commercials to encourage newspaper readership 
the times herald had asked for 33 million in actual damages and 
unspecified punitive damages the 33 million would have been

the trust funds that are financed by taxes on 
gasoline and airplane tickets should be considered in calculating 
the federal deficit a transportation department official says 
if we can agree that we must not lose sight of the total 
federal deficit i think we must then agree that we cannot ignore 
trust fund spending in setting the annual federal budget 
assistant transportation secretary kate l moore told a house 
subcommittee tuesday 
she was scheduled to testify again today before a senate public 
works panel members of congress with jurisdiction over public 
works spending are being pressured by states the aviation industry 
and contractors in particular to release money from those funds for 
muchneeded building and repair 
moore was referring to the two funds paid for by taxes on 
fuel tires cargo and airline tickets which are supposed to be 
dedicated to spending on public works such as highways bridges and 
air traffic control 
critics say the funds balances are kept artificially high to 
mask the size of the deficit some members of congress want the 
funds removed from deficit calculations in order to stop that 
alleged abuse 
congress controls the flow of money from the two accounts the 
aviation trust fund and the highway trust fund the amount of money 
that is released in a given year typically falls short of the value 
of the projects the highway money goes to states which administer 
highway programs 
the two separate funds have a combined cash balance of about 25 
billion but there is disagreement over how much is really an 
uncommitted surplus 
there is also disagreement over how much of the aviation trust 
fund should be spent on operations of the federal aviation 
administration rather than on capital equipment 
the bush administration wants to raise the airline passenger 
ticket tax from 8 percent to 10 percent in order to finance 
modernization of the air traffic control system and increase the 
share of faa operations financed by the fund 
the national aviation safety plan as the modernization is 
known is behind schedule and 4 billion more expensive than 
anticipated

continued us opposition to naval arms talks 
could undermine ussoviet ties and derail future negotiations to 
cut strategic and conventional weapons says the soviet unions 
chief arms control adviser 
marshal sergei akhromeyev issued his warning before a 
congressional panel tuesday and added a new wrinkle to moscows 
call for negotiations over a ban on shortrange nuclear weapons in 
the superpower navies 
akrhomeyev president mikhail s gorbachevs principal arms 
control adviser said his country would be willing to include 
landbased aircraft used to protect its navy in naval arms talks 
we think that nuclear weapons of all kinds of systems at sea 
should be the subject of negotiations he said in other words 
the nuclear systems which are deployed on aircraft carriers on 
submarines and on aviation 
but the overriding issue is president bushs rejection of the 
soviets plea for naval negotiations akhromeyev said 
at the malta summit last december gorbachev pressed bush on 
such talks but the administration turned down the request arguing 
that the united states must remain a naval power 
akhromeyev told a senate armed services subcommittee that us 
opposition to naval arms talks could jeopardize significant cuts in 
armed forces and weapons down the road 
we consider that sooner or later if we do not want to stop the 
negotiations on reduction of nuclear and conventional arms naval 
forces cuts negotiations are unavoidable he said 
sen edward kennedy dmass chairman of the projection forces 
and regional defense subcommittee invited akhromeyev to appear 
before the panel to discuss naval arms reductions 
members of the subcommittee expressed reservations about 
imposing limitations on us naval forces 
i am opposed to limiting the qualitative or quantitative naval 
forces said sen john warner of virginia ranking republican on 
the armed services committee and a former secretary of the navy 
sen william cohen rmaine said any reduction in the united 
states access to sea lanes is tantamount to losing oxygen to our 
lungs and added the arms control agenda is already overloaded 
akhromeyev also said the issue of whether the soviets should 
give up their ss24 nuclear missile if the united states scraps the 
railbased multiplewarhead mx missile should be addressed in 
talks once a treaty to reduce strategic weapons by 50 percent is 
signed 
it would be good if experts of our countries in this issue 
really studied this prior to getting into those future 
negotiations that issue is already on the agenda of the day he 
said 
on another issue akhromeyev said the soviet union did not 
violate the ussoviet agreement in december 1987 to eliminate 
shortrange nuclear weapons even though some ss23 missiles have 
been found in east germany bulgaria and czechoslovakia 
akhromeyev said the missiles minus nuclear warheads were sold 
to those nations before the treaty was signed and thus do not 
violate the pact

industry soon will have to comply with new 
federal requirements when disposing of toxic industrial wastes on 
land but environmentalists contend the rules dont go far enough 
to curb pollution 
it gives the green light to continue dumping billions of 
gallons of untreated hazardous waste down deep wells said jane 
bloom an attorney for the natural resources defense council 
other critics of the new regulations announced tuesday by the 
environmental protection agency said the requirements will only 
lead to new superfund toxic wastes sites in the years to come 
the epas longawaited regulations in development for six 
years call on industry by 1992 to comply fully with new treatment 
requirements for more than 40 million tons of toxic waste that are 
dumped onto the ground surface or injected into deep wells 
these rules will keep significant quantities of hazardous 
waste off the land preventing the future groundwater contamination 
and assuring safe management of these wastes said donald clay 
the epas assistant administrator in charge of hazardous waste 
regulation and the superfund cleanup program 
but several environmental groups and an industry group 
representing wastetreatment companies strongly criticized the 
agency action saying it was too weak to assure the environment 
will be protected 
this action clearly shows the epas purported commitment to 
pollution prevention is merely lip service said ms bloom of 
the washingtonbased nrdc 
richard c fortuna executive director of the hazardous waste 
treatment council said the epa action designed to curb the land 
disposal of untreated toxic chemicals instead ensures that the 
waste management practices of today will become the superfund sites 
of tomorrow 
the critics said that while the regulations impose new treatment 
requirements for some toxic wastes they also will allow industry 
to dispose of acidic and solvent wastes through dilution rather 
than special treatment to reduce the toxicity 
the environmentalists and other critics also said the epa action 
exempts toxic chemicals that go to wastewater treatment 
facilities or are injected into deep wells from special treatment 
requirements requiring instead that the wastes be diluted 
fails to establish technologybased treatment standards for 
eight toxic metals including lead cadmium chromium and mercury 
allows toxic wastewater to continue to be placed in unlined and 
leaking lagoons and some residues from the treatment process to be 
placed in unlined landfills 
this rule has every form of capitulation to every 
pollution interest imaginable said fortuna whose 
washingtonbased trade association represents hightechnology firms 
that specialize in the disposal of toxic wastes 
karen florini an attorney for the environmental defense fund 
called the new standards extremely lax and said they fail to 
meaningfully control wastes containing toxic metals 
clay the epa assistant administrator disagreed the program 
will serve as a catalyst to prevent pollution by encouraging 
all hazardous waste producers to find ways to minimize their 
wastes he said

loss and protection from cancer and other diseases is being removed 
from store shelves under threat of court action by federal 
regulators 
lawyers for phoenix international marketing corp of sparks 
nev said after meeting with food and drug administration 
officials tuesday that the cookie would be recalled and 
distribution of related products halted 
the company is cooperating fully with the fda its pulling 
back all the objectionable promotional material and they hope to 
come out with a new product shortly said david weeda a 
washingtonbased lawyer for the company 
the fda last friday told the company to take the products off 
the market because promotional materials for them made 
unsubstantiated medical claims the agency threatened to go to 
court if the company did not comply 
the material distributed about the phoenix for life weight 
control program claimed the products were useful in weight control 
and in maintaining cardiovascular health could prevent colon 
cancer and could help people with diabetes forgo medication the 
agency said 
the fda also said the cookies contained twice the approximately 
120 calories claimed on the label and disguised sugar content by 
saying on the label that the cookies contained 100 percent 
natural cane juice 
the company plans to change the recipe for the cookie and draft 
new labeling if the new labeling is approved by the fda a new 
product could be on the market within a month weeda said 
phoenix also is discontinuing temporarily other products in its 
diet plan phoenix fizzie which dissolves in water to make a 
lemonflavored drink phoenix nutritious beverage and phoenix 
vitamins and minerals capsules 
whether these products will be reintroduced is up in the 
air weeda said

johnson said were not contesting fdas conclusions 
the phoenix fiber cookie represents more than 90 percent of the 
companys sales which have soared this year from 2 million in 
january to 4 million in february and 10 million in march 
johnson said 
the cookie introduced less than two years ago contains large 
amounts of fiber and comes in chocolate chip oatmeal raisin and 
vanilla 
as part of the phoenix weightcontrol program limiting calories 
to 1200 to 1500 per day the company recommends eating a cookie 
and drinking two glasses of water in place of a meal

finance ministers from 152 nations are heading 
home after stopping short of endorsing a 13 billion fund to help 
eastern european and third world countries protect the environment 
france supported the establishment of the green fund but 
the united states and other powerful members of the international 
monetary fund and its sister organization the world bank balked 
britain and japan also opposed the new program which was backed 
by world bank president barber conable 
the world bank already keeps environmental considerations in 
mind when lending for development projects and it supports some 
environmental projects in poor countries but conable argued that a 
new program was needed to address pollution problems that spill 
across borders 
the proposal was debated into the evening tuesday by the 
22member development committee a joint body of the imf and world 
bank that sets policy for the agencies development lending 
in a statement the committee said further work was 
necessary on the proposal and that meantime the world bank 
should take steps to reinforce its existing environmental 
programs 
french finance minister pierre beregovoy had pleaded with other 
countries to send a positive signal by approving the program 
now time is passing he said 
among the projects that would be eligible are those aimed at 
protecting the ozone layer promoting diversity of animal and plant 
species reducing emission of gases thought to cause global 
warming protecting multinational river systems and preventing 
deforestation and the spread of deserts 
the idea is that no matter how zealous industrialized countries 
are in attacking those problems within their boundaries the 
problems will not improve unless underdeveloped nations also 
participate 
there is no doubt industrial countries are under the 
obligation to avoid deterioration of the environment 
beregovoy said developing countries must also mobilize and 
we must help them to do so 
the green fund as envisioned by conable would be a pilot 
project lending 13 billion over for three years at low interest 
rates 
much of the money would go to third world nations but eastern 
european countries that had neglected their environment under four 
decades of communist rule would also be eligible 
however the united states concerned about its budget deficit 
and other large contributors to the world bank argued the agency 
should work to strengthen its existing environmental programs 
it should for instance play a greater role in promoting 
debtfornature swaps in which a developing country agrees to 
preserve its rain forest for instance in exchange for a reduction 
in its debt burden treasury secretary nicholas brady said 
conable a former republican congressman from new york had met 
with white house chief of staff john sununu to seek us backing 
for the green fund but was rebuffed brady however insisted that 
the environment is an issue of great importance to the united 
states 
the finance officials did agree on a plan to increase the 
lending capacity of the imf to 180 billion from 120 billion 
currently 
the funds policymaking board the interim committee announced 
its support of the record increase in contributions from imf 
members tuesday morning it must now be ratified by members over 
the next nine to 18 months 
at the insistence of the united states the committee linked the 
increase to a program to crack down on 11 poor nations who owe the 
fund 4 billion 
the countries will get loans from a special imf account if they 
default on their obligations however they could lose their voting 
rights and the gold they originally contributed to the imf could be 
sold

marta istomin cited a considerable 
philosophical difference with the new chairman of the john f 
kennedy center for the performing arts in announcing her 
resignation as artistic director 
in a letter tuesday to james d wolfensohn a new york 
investment banker who took command of the kennedy center on march 
23 mrs istomin the widow of cellist pablo casals expressed 
resentment at the chairmans recent criticism of the centers 
programming under her stewardship for the last 10 years 
in turn she attacked wolfensohns plans for a series of 
ambitious performing arts festivals as quickly expiring 
fireworks with little effect on expanding the kennedy centers 
audiences or raising the level of artistic taste 
in a threeparagraph statement wolfensohn said i greatly 
regret mrs istomins decision to resign she has been a fine 
artistic director and has done exemplary work for more than a 
decade he said 
mrs istomin a puerto ricanborn musician was appointed 
artistic director of the center in february 1980 
my programs have been mainly focused on lasting values and 
substance rather than shortterm glitter she wrote wolfensohn on 
april 13 when she first served notice she was resigning effective 
may 31 
to attract an estimated 15 million annually in private funds to 
support the kennedy centers own programming wolfensohn has 
announced plans for a texas state performing arts festival in 1991 
a possible east european festival the same year and a festival of 
the americas in 1992 on the 500th anniversary of columbus 
discovery of america 
in her letter tuesday mrs istomin made clear she thought 
wolfensohns festival plans were an attempt to catch the publics 
fancy while trying to obtain new financial support for the center 
wolfensohn has asked congress and the bush administration to 
provide 45 million in federal funds to pay off the kennedy 
centers accumulated debts and to make longneglected repairs

major league baseball must first evaluate the success of two new 
national league franchises planned for no later than 1993 before 
committing to four more 
meetings between baseballs top executive and senators seeking 
to push new franchises for their states have become a semiannual 
event on capitol hill and once more lawmakers questioned 
baseballs antitrust exemption 
what i said very precisely was that the difference between 
us is that i am unwilling to commit baseball to expand beyond 
the two teams in the national league in the near term vincent 
told reporters after tuesdays meeting with lawmakers i dont 
say it will not happen i think it is unlikely 
national league club owners are scheduled to announce that 
circuits longawaited expansion plan during a meeting scheduled in 
cleveland on june 1314 vincent emphasized tuesday that no cities 
will be awarded franchises at that time and that the owners will 
merely state guidelines for interested bidders 
denver and tampa bayst petersburg fla are believed to be 
major contenders for the two new national league franchises

israel has offered documents in an effort to 
prove that israelimade weapons that wound up in the hands of a 
colombian drug lord were sent to antigua at that caribbean nations 
request 
the file of 14 documents was handed over tuesday to a visiting 
antiguan delegation and some were shown to foreign reporters by 
israeli officials 
they included a certificate signed by antiguas top defense 
official vere bird jr assuring israel that the arms were for the 
exclusive use of antiguas security forces 
in march 1989 israels defense ministry said 400 galil assault 
rifles and 100 miniuzi submachine guns were shipped to antigua and 
reached their destination the haaretz newspaper said the value of 
the arms deal was about 220000 
israeli officials say they dont know how the weapons ended up 
on the ranch of gonzalo rodriguez gacha a leader of the medellin 
drug cartel who was killed in a shootout with colombian police in 
december about 200 of the galil assault rifles were confiscated in 
a police raid on the ranch 
antiguan officials have been quoted as saying they neither 
ordered nor received the arms 
the antiguan delegaton headed by patrick lewis an antiguan 
diplomat at the united nations arrived monday night to investigate 
the affair he was accompanied by three us lawyers they met 
tuesday with foreign ministry officials including the head of the 
latin american desk 
israel asked the antiguan delegation how and why a promise 
made to israel was broken and how items of an arms deal 
supplied to antigua finally arrived in private hands in another 
country said moti amichai a foreign ministry spokesman 
he said the antiguan delegation would also meet with other 
israelis involved in the deal but did not give details 
lewis refused to comment on the documents 
we were sent here to gather information and we really cant 
make any comments or statements we have to report to our 
government he said 
at a briefing reporters were shown three documents each 
written in english on what appeared to be official antiguan 
stationary bearing the nations coat of arms 
these included a letter dated may 16 1985 and signed by 
antiguan cabinet secretary lionel stevens the letter appointed a 
maurice sarfati as special envoy of antiguas ministry of foreign 
affairs 
the other two documents officials showed to reporters included 
an enduser certificate and authorization for sarfati to broker the 
arms deal 
the enduser certificate was attached to a invoice for the 
weapons and said the below listed items will not be passed 
sold or given to any third party 
the two documents were signed nov 9 1988 by vere bird jr 
who is security adviser to his father antiguan prime minister vere 
c bird 81 
the new york times on sunday said sarfati who owned a 
debtridden produce business in antigua and israeli army reserve 
lt col yair klein directed the diversion of weapons to colombia 
amichai said he could not confirm if sarfati was an israeli 
citizen or had any links with israel 
the daily maariv newspaper identified sarfati as an israeli 
businessman who had received special envoy status from antigua to 
develop energy tourism and commerce 
klein said he had been hired to run a training camp in antigua 
for panamanian rebels opposed to thendictator manuel noriega he 
said the weapons were apparently sent to the panamanians after the 
plans for the camp fell through and some of them somehow got to 
colombia 
klein repeatedly denied any involvement in the diversion 
last year klein was accused of training hit squads for the 
medellin drug cartel in colombia klein denied the allegations and 
said he was training farmers in self defense 
in antigua bird jr denied any wrongdoing but stepped down from 
his post until the matter is resolved 
the three us lawyers joining the antiguan delegation are 
lawrence barcella jr edgar seibert and conan lewis a foreign

kupaianaha vent on the eastern side of the volcano a distance of 
about 8 miles 
officials were keeping watch on the steam clouds rising from the 
sea known as laze laze contains hydrochloric acid and other 
hazardous chemicals but so far trade winds are blowing the gas out 
to sea the weather service said 
no lava has flowed from the kupaianaha vent since monday but 
geologists have said it could be just another in a series of pauses

public schools are failing to deal effectively 
with emotionally disabled children and at least twothirds of all 
such youngsters arent getting any help at all a 
soontobepublished study says 
schools tend to emphasize silence and obedience over learning 
and offer few opportunities for the emotionally handicapped to work 
with other children or learn social skills according to the study 
by researchers at bank street college of education in new york 
many other youngters are being mislabeled as emotionally 
disabled simply because they are mad bad sad and cant add 
and have thus gotten on the nerves of their teachers the study 
found 
some 400000 students less than 1 percent of the school 
population have been identified as having behavior disorders by 
school authorities but studies estimate the true proportion is at 
least three to five times higher 
this suggests that at best somewhere between 10 and 30 percent 
of children in need are identified said the report 
youngsters with behavioral handicaps are entitled to special 
education under federal law but whether or not emotionally 
handicapped children get special help from their schools depends as 
much on available resources and local attitudes toward difficult 
behavior as on students needs the report said 
the report also found that only one out of three emotionally 
disabled students functions at or above grade level and 42 percent 
drop out 
the study to be published later this month was written by jane 
knitzer zina steinberg and brahm fleisch 
it was based on questionnaires sent to state directors of 
special education and mental health officials visits to 26 
programs in 13 states a review of literature in the field and 
interviews with parents and educators from 1987 to 1989 
the report leaves me optimistic simply because such a report 
finally exists said william schipper executive director of the 
national association of state directors of special education 
this is a very tough group to educate a highcost group but 
the state of practice is well well behind what the research tells 
us he said 
the report singled out a few exemplary programs 
golden lake elementary in circle pine minn sends special 
educators into regular classrooms allowing youngsters to stay with 
normal peers 
central park east school in harlem and elementary schools in new 
haven conn benton harbor mich and prince georges county 
md have begun reforms that help all students such schools tend 
to shy from labeling youngsters handicapped 
states for their part need to reexamine policies the report 
said in some states for example school districts are off the 
hook financially if a student is referred to a state facility

experimenting with drugs can be a sign of 
normal adolescent development says a new study that calls into 
question the just say no appeal to shun drugs altogether 
adolescents who experiment with drugs tend to be better adjusted 
than abstainers or abusers according to the findings by 
psychologists jonathan shedler and jack block of the university of 
california berkeley 
the researchers conclusion that selfcontrol may be more 
critical than abstinence conflicts with the just say no 
antidrug campaign but some peers agreed tuesday that casual drug 
use does not always lead to addiction 
this may be hard for some people to take but the real issue 
is knowing when to put the brakes on said dr shirley feldman 
deputy director of stanford universitys center for study of 
family children and youth 
theres a whole big world out there and psychologically 
speaking experimentation is healthy in most youths 
shedler said the findings from the research which tracked 101 
san francisco youths from age 3 to 18 absolutely do not mean 
drug experimentation is something that is beneficial 
but it does mean that some limited drug experimentation may 
not be catastrophic he said it could be a sign of trouble to 
come or simply a sign of normal adolescent exploration 
the study published in the may issue of american psychologists 
found drug abuse is a symptom of deepseated psychological problems 
originating in early childhood and is worsened by indifferent 
parenting 
at age 18 those who used at least marijuana once a week were 
alienated lacking in ability to control their impulses and 
distressed compared with experimenters the study said abstainers 
at that age were anxious emotionally constricted and lacking in 
social skills compared with experimenters or teenagers who used 
marijuana or another illegal drug no more than once a month 
those same psychological and behavioral traits were reported 
when the children were studied at ages 5 7 and 11 according to 
the continuing research the study group is now age 23 
brian flay director of drug prevention research in the public 
health department of the university of illinois said the just 
say no campaign has always been off the mark 
we cant stop kids from trying everything flay said the 
just say no campaign is extremely simplistic it should be 
learn how to moderate your behavior learn how to resist the 
pressure to go overboard 
some psychologists including shedler contend a more effective 
antidrug effort would identify children who have traits that 
signal possible drug problems later in life and then counsel those 
at risk youths 
nobody can predict absolutely whos going to abuse drugs but 
we can talk about risk factors that are pretty good indicators 
shedler said 
among the factors identified by the study the mothers of 
frequent drug users and abstainers were perceived to be cold 
critical pressuring and unresponsive to their childrens needs 
the researchers said 
the study found no noteworthy findings involving fathers of 
frequent drug users but fathers of abstainers were relatively 
unresponsive to their childrens needs and were domineering 
about twothirds of the 18yearolds in the study had tried 
marijuana which is consistent with national figures few got 
involved with harder drugs although those who did have great 
problems according to shedler 
some researchers have credited antidrug education with a 
decline in illegal drug use among young people 
a 1989 survey of college students found that 367 percent used 
an illicit drug at least once during the previous year compared 
with 562 percent in 1980 when the survey began drug use among 
high school seniors dropped from 656 percent in 1981 to 509 
percent last year 
this reduced demand is attributable largely to the important 
changes occurring in the attitudes beliefs and social norms among 
our young people said lloyd johnston a university of michigan 
social scientist who helped conduct the survey

the tokyo stock exchanges key index slipped 
slightly today after a fiveday climb and the dollar declined 
against the japanese yen 
the dollar closed at 15703 yen down 102 yen from tuesdays 
close it opened at 15724 yen and ranged between 15695 yen and 
15740 yen 
currency dealers attributed the dollars weakness to its 
overnight drop in new york in part due to european currencies 
strength against the dollar as well as results of the threeyear 
us treasury bond auction tuesday in washington 
the predominant sentiment of the market today was watching 
from the sidelines said a trader with daiichi kangyo bank 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
another trader at the bank of tokyo said higherthanexpected 
bidding in the us treasury bond auction made the dollar less 
attractive to currency investors because it suggested us interest 
rates would not rise significantly 
the daiichi kangyo bank trader noted however that 10 and 
30year treasury bonds were to be auctioned today and thursday and 
until we see the results we cant really say where it dollar 
is going but i dont think the yen will get much stronger than it 
is now 
on the stock market the nikkei stock average of 225 selected 
issues a 1431point gainer the previous day fell 2497 points 
or 008 percent closing at 3094561 
it was the indexs first decline since april 26 in the five 
trading days before today the index rose 1546 points or 525 
percent 
securities dealer attributed todays decline mainly to 
profittaking 
after the nikkei index surpassed the 31000point mark in 
early morning trading many investors turned to profittaking 
said a dealer with nikko securities speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
the index rose for five consecutive days until yesterday and 
many thought it was about time to take a break said another 
dealer with a major japanese brokerage also requesting anonymity 
but as far as the market environment is concerned such as the 
stronger yen and the performance of foreign stock exchanges 
overnight it looks like a bullish market is ahead of us it seems 
to have managed the heavy profittaking today he added 
a dealer with nomura securities said the yens rise triggered 
sales of exportoriented issues such as electricity and automobile 
shares the stronger yen generally depresses the profits of 
exportdependent industries 
in bond dealings the price of the benchmark no 119 10year 
japanese government bonds was quoted at 8672 points at 4 pm up 
from tuesdays close at 8646 the yield fell to 7220 percent from 
7275 percent the previous day

some people never throw anything 
away according to scott bruce who came to this breakfast food 
mecca looking for old cereal boxes to add to his collection 
sound flaky 
cereal boxes represent heroes of popular culture the grain 
gods i call them said bruce a cambridge mass collector who 
once started a lunchbox collecting craze 
when a kid sits down with a bowl of his favorite cereal he 
becomes one with his hero its like a secular communion rite 
bruce 34 is talking this week with cereal company executives 
as well as ordinary people who hoard cereal boxes if there is such 
a thing 
rare boxes can fetch up to 1000 said bruce who began his 
collection in 1988 and recently published a collectors magazine 
called flake 
battle creek is the home of kellogg co the worlds largest 
cereal maker as well as post and ralstonpurina plants 
the people here have cereal in their bloodstream said bruce 
old cereal boxes are all the more valuable because of the 
scarcity of people who allow them to hang around 
the militant mom was the death to many collections he said 
mournfully but maybe ill find that that odd citizen who has a 
corn flakes box with vanessa williams miss williams miss 
america 1984 lost the crown when it was disclosed she had posed 
nude for playboy 
bruce said he generally hunts for vintage boxes in good 
condition from the 1930s through 1970s but hes even squirreling 
away some of todays boxes 
the 1990 batman cereal box from ralston is an instant 
classic he said just you wait

the navy is dropping its bid to force repayment of 
tuition from two cadets expelled from rotc for homosexuality 
a navy spokesman tuesday said the cases were reviewed on their 
merits and the decision was made not to seek recoupment the new 
york times reported today 
however the unidentified spokesman said there had been no 
change in the pentagons ban on homosexuals in military 
robert l bettiker 22 a chemistry major at massachusetts 
institute of technology and david carney a 23yearold harvard 
graduate studying in britain had been dismissed after informing 
their commanders they are gay 
the navy had said it would seek reimbursement of their 
scholarship money 38612 from bettiker and 50687 from carney 
bettiker on tuesday called the turnaround great and said he 
hoped it would have implications for other rotc cadets in similar 
circumstances 
the way its worded they tried to make it as particular to me 
as possible but i feel its a precedent said bettiker who was 
discharged jan 31 
the ohio native had planned to enter the navys prestigious 
nuclear propulsion program after graduation next month but will now 
work in a cancer research laboratory at the university of 
california at berkeley 
i always felt i did what was right said carney i never 
thought in the end they would sue for the money the navy is not as 
meanspirited as that 
in a third case involving the expulsion of james holobaugh a 
gay army rotc cadet at washington university in st louis an army 
officer has made a preliminary recommendation that the army try to 
recover it scholarship money 
holobaughs case attracted the support of 24 members of congress 
for the rotc cadets 
we believe that to compel these men to repay this money would 
not only be fundamentally unfair it would also reflect an 
appalling meanspiritedness which has no place in the navy the 
lawmakers said in a letter written by rep gerry studds dmass

the national institutes of health has reprimanded 
childrens hospital for failing to seek parents consent for a 
comparison study of two treatments for infants with damaged lungs 
the hospital made a serious error in not asking for consent 
from the parents of babies chosen randomly to receive conventional 
treatment the federal agency said in a recent letter quoted in 
todays the boston globe 
nineteen of the 20 babies who received the experimental 
treatment survived against six of 10 treated conventionally 
the tests were part of a study that was published in december 
and confirmed the value of the experimental treatment 
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or ecmo which breathes 
for the infants until their lungs can take over 
charles r mccarthy director of the nih office for protection 
from research risks said the committee at childrens hospital that 
approves all human studies made decisions that rightfully belong 
to the parents they really blew it 
the action is believed to be the only time the federal office 
has reprimanded a hospital for failing to ask consent of all 
subjects in a study 
dr peter h wolff of childrens hospital told the agency in a 
letter that he would seek consent in all future human studies 
but wolff chairman of the committee that approves human studies 
at the hospital defended the failure to seek consent saying that 
asking all parents for permission would impose unacceptable 
psychological burdens on the parents of children not included in 
the ecmo arm of the study 
dr michael epstein who led the study said that parents of 
conventionally treated infants were not informed to spare them 
anguish he said that even if they decided not to allow their child 
to participate there was no way they could have obtained the 
experimental treatment for their child at least not at childrens 
i continue to be troubled by all of this discussion he 
said but i still feel that we acted in a morally appropriate 
way given the conditions at the time 
at the time the experimental treatment was available at many 
other us hospitals and some studies indicated it offered better 
chances of survival to infants with severely damaged lungs 
however no random controlled study had proven its advantage or 
documented its safety 
wolffs committee decided not to seek consent of all 
participants to avoid difficulty recruiting subjects for the 
conventional treatment according to a letter from mccarthys 
office sent to the hospital in november 
the hospital researchers have acknowledged in scientific reports 
that a random study would probably show large differences in 
survival between emco and the standard therapy

a german observatory known as rosat 
will be carried into orbit aboard a delta rocket may 31 to study 
the heavens for sources of cosmic xrays 
the 170 million satellite will perform the first full sky 
survey of celestial bodies that emit xrays said volker 
kaltenbach rosat spacecraft manager for the german aerospace 
research establishment of west germany 
it will use the largest imaging xray telescope ever built 
rosat is up to now the most ambitious project in the young 
history of xray astronomy kaltenbach said tuesday 
about 1000 sources of cosmic xrays which do not penetrate the 
atmosphere and therefore are invisible from the ground are known 
to exist 
astronomers hope rosat will identify 100000 sources said alan 
bunner rosat program scientist for nasa it will observe stars 
black holes and supernova remnants hot clouds produced by 
exploding stars at the end of their lives 
the observatory originally was scheduled to be carried into 
orbit by a space shuttle but the 1986 challenger explosion delayed 
the mission along with everything else and neither the german 
aerospace research establishment nor nasa wanted to wait until the 
mid1990s bunner said 
rosat was redesigned somewhat to be launched aboard mcdonnell 
douglas unmanned delta 2 rocket from cape canaveral air force 
station bunner said 
the 170 million cost of the satellite excludes rocket and 
launch expenses which are being covered by nasa the united states 
has contributed about 106 million to the project great britain 
also has paid part of the costs 
rosat is short for roentgen satellite named after german 
scientist wilhelm conrad rontgen who discovered xrays in 1895

drought is forcing part of the san 
francisco bay area to ration water for the second time in three 
years 
under the plan approved tuesday by the city public utilities 
commission the cost of water will jump beginning in july by 
about 9 percent increasing the average household bill to 628 a 
month 
water customers will be given allotments based on the number of 
people in a household those who use 10 percent above the allotment 
will have their base rate doubled while big water wasters may face 
a tenfold rate increase 
in addition hosing down sidewalks is forbidden decorative 
water fountains will be shut off and restaurant customers will not 
be given water unless they ask for it 
there is a real emergency said rodel rodis commission 
president 
officials aim to cut consumption to 25 percent of 1987 levels 
for a total of 22 million people about a third of the bay area 
population in san francisco san mateo and santa clara counties 
and alameda county across the san francisco bay 
it is the fourth straight year of drought in northern 
california rationing also was ordered in 1988 before that it was 
last rationed in 1977 
in march the santa clara valley water district in the southern 
part of the san francisco bay area ordered mandatory cuts of 20 
percent to 25 percent 
some parched southern california communities also are rationing

newsday suspended columnist jimmy breslin after 
he obscenely insulted an asianamerican reporter and phoned a radio 
personality to joke about it on the air 
the 61yearold pulitzer prizewinning columnist was suspended 
for two weeks without pay don forst editor of new york newsday 
said early today 
breslin launched into a tirade in the newsroom friday after 
reporter jiyeon mary yuh 25 criticized his may 3 column as 
sexist in an internal computer message in an expletivelaced 
outburst breslin referred to her as a yellow cur and 
slanteyed 
breslin was later reprimanded by his editors and apologized to 
the staff in a computer message 
forst said the paper had believed the reprimand and apology were 
sufficient until hearing breslins onair conversation which 
indicated a lack of sensitivity to what what has been and 
continues to be a painful episode 
the conversation took place tuesday with howard stern a wxrkfm 
personality who is known for racial and ethnic jokes and who 
tangled with the federal communications commission over his 
sexually frank language 
i have one social problem coming out of all of this breslin 
said on the air explaining that his nephew is to marry a korean 
woman in september 
now does this mean i cant go to the wedding he said 
calls to breslin at newsday and at home were not immediately 
returned 
on tuesday a group of newsday reporters including yuh had 
asked for breslins suspension or for the paper to print a column 
about bias against asian women they had also threatened to 
withhold their bylines on stories 
after the meeting newsday editors listened to a tape of the 
radio show and decided to discipline breslin new york newsday 
reported today 
the suspension was applauded by a representative of one 
asianamerican group 
basically we are glad that management had decided to do the 
right thing said jeannie park a board member of the asian

at his inauguration as new yorks first black 
mayor david dinkins hailed the city as a gorgeous mosaic of 
races nationalities and sexual orientations five months later 
cracks in the mosaic are showing 
a flurry of events threatens to turn the melting pot into a 
bubbling cauldron 
at city college two professors preach racial supremacy one for 
whites one for blacks in brooklyn a black group boycotts korean 
grocers a white newspaper columnist slurs a koreanamerican 
coworker a columbia university soccer player gives a speech 
attacking homosexuals and jews 
voices of caution are being heard after a black student 
reported to police that she had been sexually assaulted by white 
st johns university students black leaders came to the school to 
say there appeared to be no racial dimension to the case 
racist fires are alight the new york times warned in an 
editorial this week about the brooklyn boycott of two koreanrun 
grocery stores by blacks the paper urged dinkins to follow through 
on his campaign promise of bringing people together 
dinkins on tuesday defended his lowkey approach to the racial 
conflicts and said he was using tremendously delicate diplomacy 
to resolve the dispute over the groceries 
racial tension is a constant presence in varying degrees in new 
york where millions of people from around the world live and work 
in 1986 for example young men in the largely white howard beach 
neighborhood hounded a black man to his death and blacks protested 
for months 
but the recent rash of highprofile incidents has raised 
questions about whether racial and ethnic harmony has been strained 
beyond normal limits 
in the antikorean boycott blacks led by selfproclaimed 
antiwhite activist sonny carson berated and spat on those who 
tried to shop at the stores whose business has plummeted 
leaflets encouraged consumers to avoid patronizing people who 
do not look like us carson a convicted kidnapper was dismissed 
from the dinkins campaign last year for inflammatory remarks about 
jews 
there are people out there who want to foment race riots 
said richard izzo a lawyer representing the koreans in a civil 
rights suit against the protesters 
the city has been more active in battling racial violence like 
the august attack on yusuf hawkins a black 16yearold shot to 
death while shopping for a used car in a mostly white brooklyn 
neighborhood 
two juries today were considering separately the fate of two 
white men charged in the killing 
the rev al sharpton a black activist who has been pressing the 
prosecution of the case last week urged blacks to remain calm 
regardless of the verdict we do not want yusuf hawkins name 
tainted with senseless violence he said 
but in todays new york post sharpton warned that anything less 
than murder convictions would lead to violence 
you are lighting a match to the end of a powder keg and 
telling us to burn the town down he said 
we are not calling for mindless violence sharpton added 
dont blame me as a social weatherman im telling you that the 
clouds of violence are over new york city 
violence broke out last week when philosophy professor michael 
levin offered a talk in brooklyn titled white fear of black crime 
is morally and epistemically correct nine people were arrested 
and six police officers injured in a scuffle prompted by the 
lecture 
levin and professor leonard jeffries jr who believes whites 
are inferior to blacks teach at city college which is 39 percent 
black 28 percent hispanic 17 percent white and 16 percent asian 
at columbia university soccer player chris ziadie stunned an 
athletic awards banquet by charging the administration there 
catered to jews and homosexuals at the expense of other students 
newsday announced today that it is suspending pulitzer 
prizewinning columnist jimmy breslin for two weeks without pay for 
a newsroom outburst in which he used racial and sexual slurs 
against a koreanamerican reporter 
breslin has apologized to the reporter and the staff 
as these incidents hang heavy over the city the world of 
fiction provides little relief a movie crew has been in town 
making the film version of tom wolfes novel bonfire of the 
vanities sparking protests that the blacks and hispanics of the 
bronx are being unfairly portrayed as criminals 
in the newly released qampa featuring nick nolte as a corrupt 
irishamerican cop the soundtrack is thick with racial epithets as 
nolte goes about wiping out blacks hispanics and homosexuals

six months after the government proposed new human 
rights safeguards widespread torture and other abuses continue 
unabated in turkey according to a report released today by amnesty 
international 
in early 1990 thousands of people remained imprisoned for 
political reasons including hundreds of prisoners of conscience 
convicted for their nonviolent political or religious 
activities the international human rights organization said 
among them are members of political organizations trade 
unions and kurdish groups as well as journalists and religious 
activists the use of torture continues to be widespread and 
systematic in some cases resulting in death 
turkey ratified the united nations convention against torture in 
1988 the report said 
in september and november the government announced proposals 
governing length of detention access to lawyers and protection for 
prisoners of conscience none of those proposals has been enacted 
under the government proposal the maximum detention period 
under police custody would be reduced from 15 days to 4to10 days 
though longer detention would be permitted under emergency 
legislation 
the government also proposed abolishing the death penalty for 13 
categories of offenses but not for murder and political offenses 
that produce the most death sentences the report said 
while these draft amendments if passed would represent a 
step in the right direction they nevertheless would fall short of 
international standards in important respects amnesty said 
the report included testimony from several prisoners who said 
they were tortured with beatings on the soles of their feet 
electric shocks showers of ice cold water and hanging by their 
arms 
torture is still routine even among those detained for only a 
few days amnesty reported 
the testimony of prisoners shows anyone is at risk from 
torture in turkey particularly if held on political grounds the 
report said 
many prisoners sign confessions under torture which are then 
used as evidence against them in violation of international 
standards it said

a botched execution that caused flames 
to shoot from the head of an inmate in an electric chair was caused 
by a synthetic sponge gov bob martinez said 
the malfunction occurred because two maintenance workers had 
substituted a synthetic sponge for the natural sponge that serves 
as a conduit for electrical current applied to the prisoners head 
martinez said tuesday the synthetic sponge didnt work properly 
he said 
flames smoke and sparks shot 3 to 6 inches above the head of 
jessie tafero as authorities administered three 2000volt shocks 
to the convicted copkiller on friday 
the governor said the maintenance workers took it upon 
themselves to replace what they thought to be a wornout sponge 
and didnt realize there is a different chemical reaction by virtue 
of substituting a synthetic sponge for a natural sponge 
a report from corrections secretary richard dugger said tafero 
died immediately the attending physicians report indicated that 
at the least the condemned man was knocked unconscious by the jolt 
there is no way to apply 2000 volts directly to someones 
brain without killing them instantly said dugger who has 
witnessed 16 executions they are never conscious of what 
happens 
dugger in a report requested by the governor said prison 
officials had conducted a test using a household toaster that 
confirmed the synthetic sponge caused the problem 
although the sponge was only in the toaster for ten seconds it 
produced a large amount of smoke and reduced in size by 
approximately twothirds the report said 
taferos attorney mark olive of atlanta and the florida 
clearinghouse on criminal justice called the execution torture 
tom horkan executive director of the florida catholic conference 
referred to it as a barbarous experience 
martinez whose support of the death penalty has been 
highlighted in his reelection ads said he opposed legislative 
attempts to introduce lethal injection as another means of 
execution in florida 
there have been injections where theyve missed the vein he 
said im not sure from time to time there isnt going to be 
debate about some procedure but i think in carrying out a 
difficult mission its been carried out appropriately 
tafero was executed for the 1976 shooting deaths of florida 
highway patrol trooper phillip black and visiting canadian 
constable donald irwin of kitchener ontario 
he was the 22nd person put to death in florida since the 1976 
us supreme court ruling allowing states to resume use of the 
death penalty

up two buses at a terminal in this sikh holy city today with bombs 
concealed in plastic baskets killing at least four people and

said 
five minutes later the second bomb exploded in a bus a few 
yards away injuring 15 passengers he said 
both buses caught fire and were gutted 
gupta said the casualties were lower in the second blast because 
most passengers were evacuated from buses at the terminal after the 
first explosion 
if the alarm had not been raised before the blast the 
casualties would have been much higher he said 
bus station superviser dilip singh said the police acting on 
intelligence reports began searching for a bomb an hour before the 
blasts 
ranjit singh the driver of another bus said he was parking his 
vehicle alongside the first bus when i heard a loud explosion and

of amritsar in jammukashmir state and was packed with hindu 
pilgrims he said

temple is also the stronghold of sikh militants who have been 
fighting since 1982 for a separate nation they propose to carve out 
of punjab

tuesday night united news of india news agency said the killings 
brought to 777 the number of people sikh militants are alleged to 
have killed this year alone

champions of electoral reform claimed their 
first victory today after israels supreme court ordered political 
parties to make full disclosure of any political deals they make to 
form government coalitions 
in a unanimous 25page decision a threemember panel of judges 
ruled in favor of suits filed by four israeli citizens against the 
centerleft labor party led by shimon peres and the rival 
rightwing likud bloc of prime minister yitzhak shamir as well as 
other individual politicians 
chief justice meir shamgar wrote that the disclosure should be 
made in the knesset or parliament no later than the day the prime 
ministerdesignate presents his new government for a vote of 
confidence 
free opinion and public knowledge of what is occuring in the 
system of government are an integral part of the democratic 
system he wrote public confidence cannot possibly be 
maintained on the basis of things which are concealed 
the court said that hiding information is justified only when 
state security relations with foreign countries or vital public 
interests are endangered 
uriel reichman a law professor who has been a reform leader 
hailed the ruling as step toward overhauling what he called the 
corrupt system of political horsetrading 
a coalition agreement cant be signed any longer in sealed 
rooms without the public knowing how national interests are decided 
and taxpayers money is distributed he said 
reichman said it would give new impetus to the reform campaign 
which started six weeks ago with an outburst of public anger over 
secret deals that were made to lure politicians to cross party 
lines and to win over small religious factions 
this is a victory for the protest movement said shraga 
eliad one of the four citizens who petitioned the court 
the movement began with a small group of hunger strikers shortly 
after the national unity government collapsed march 15 tens of 
thousands later joined public demonstrations and a halfmillion 
signatures about 10 percent of israels 47 million people were 
gathered 
shamir has been given a presidential mandate to try to form a 
government coalition after peres failed to put together a coalition 
that would have excluded likud 
amnon rubenstein head of the liberal shinui change party 
said disclosure of coalition agreements would heighten public 
disgust with the existing system and put pressure on the large 
parties 
he said the test will come when parliament takes up reform 
proposals in the next few weeks including bills for direct 
election of the prime minister and for the election of 80 of the 
120 members of parliament by districts 
parliament candidates are currently selected by the parties and 
run on a nationwide list 
rubenstein said ultraorthodox religious parties which hold the 
balance of power between labor and likud were to blame for the lack 
of change until now 
the orthodox parties exercise a stranglehold they veto 
reform whenever it threatens their interests he said 
both major political parties welcomed the decision even though 
they were targets of the lawsuit 
yossi brun a spokesman for likud said the party had disclosed 
its agreements with small parties including the torah flag and 
torah guardians religious factions 
the jerusalem post said the agreement with torah flag pledged to 
give the party an extra 48 million for education aborption of new 
immigrants and religious activities 
it is inconceivable that we would go against the supreme court 
decision we are for the decision he said 
but he said the decision did not apply to intraparty agreements 
and would not force likud to make public its pact with avraham 
sharir a former tourism minister who was lured back after crossing 
over to labor briefly 
labor party secretary micha harish was quoted by the jerusalem 
post as saying we will keep our promise to disclose details of 
coalition pacts

president fw de klerk of south africa arrived 
here today on the first stop of an 18day european tour viewed by 
his government as a major step toward ending decades of 
international isolation 
buoyed by a breakthrough in blackwhite negotiations at home de 
klerk plans to meet with presidents and prime ministers in nine 
west european countries the most extensive trip by a south 
african leader since the governing national party took power in 
1948 
in his talks with european leaders de klerk is likely to urge 
an easing of economic sanctions imposed on his country and to seek 
support for his initiative to negotiate a political settlement with 
the black majority 
he is to confer thursday with president francois mitterrand who 
shunned pw botha de klerks predecessor when botha came to 
france to visit the graves of south african soldiers killed in the 
two world wars 
no senior french official was at orly airport to greet de klerk 
who was met by a foreign ministry representative and a military 
honor guard 
de klerk had no public events scheduled today but planned a news 
conference thursday evening after meetings with mitterrand and 
premier michel rocard 
de klerk reportedly was to have lunch thursday with prominent 
business leaders from across france south africas sixth largest 
trading partner despite its observance of limited european 
community economic sanctions 
mitterrand decided to invite de klerk after the south african 
leader made moves toward reform in february including the release 
of jailed south african black leader nelson mandela and the 
legalization of antiapartheid groups 
last week de klerk and a delegation of african national 
congress officials led by mandela agreed to work together to end 
political violence and clear the way for formal negotiations on a 
new postapartheid constitution that would end the 5 million white 
minoritys monopoly on power 
it is wonderful to go to europe with the knowledge that south 
africa is busy taking its rightful place in the international 
community de klerk told reporters before his departure from 
johannesburg late tuesday 
en route he conferred briefly with president felix 
houphouetboigny of the ivory coast during a refueling stop in 
abidjan the capital of the west african country no details were 
available on their meeting 
south africas staterun television quoted a senior government 
source as saying the european trip represented a concerted effort 
to pull south africa from the morass the country has found itself 
in the report said the visit is of the utmost importance 
to south africa 
after france de klerk will visit belgium italy west germany 
britain spain switzerland greece and portugal 
among his hosts will be british prime minister margaret 
thatcher king juan carlos of spain and west german chancellor 
helmut kohl 
frances relations with south africa have been marked by several 
peculiarities 
in the 1970s french authorities incurred international 
criticism for nurturing a major arms trade with south africa 
including the sale of the mirage fighter planes the backbone of 
south africas air force 
since mitterrand became president in 1981 france has stayed in 
step with other european community members in imposing selective 
sanctions but has never been a vocal advocate of escalating such 
embargoes in some parisian liquor stores south african wines are 
displayed in windows alongside local vintages 
johnny clegg the white leader of a multiracial antiapartheid 
south african rock n roll group is more of a superstar in france 
than anywhere outside his home country yet the antiapartheid 
movement in france is less of a force than its counterparts in 
britain the netherlands and scandinavia

according to authorities associates said he suffered from cancer 
and pneumonia 
the conservative fundraiser who also operated a public 
relations firm became the first person to be convicted in the 
irancontra affair when he pleaded guilty in april 1987 to a 
charge of conspiring to defraud the government 
channells agreement to cooperate with the investigation of 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh was the first break for 
irancontra prosecutors

five thousand people who oppose 
secessionist movements in the baltics turned a parade celebrating 
soviet victory in world war ii into an antiindependence rally in 
latvia today 
the rally was held in the shadow of rigas towering monument to 
the victory over nazi germany and speakers addressing the crowd 
denounced the latvian parliaments declaration of independence on 
friday 
we consider the declaration of independence a defeat for 
everyone said lt gen oleg zinchenko head of the political 
directorate of the baltic military region which includes latvia 
lithuania and estonia 
zinchenko said the military was calling on the kremlin to 
intervene more forcefully in the three baltics republics many of 
his listeners waved bright red banners and latvian flags emblazoned 
with the soviet hammer and sickle 
a similar military parade took place in the neighoring republic 
of lithuania radio vilnius reported it said there were no 
confrontations between backers and opponents of lithuanias march 
11 declaration of independence 
one resident of vilnius however said that 200 young people 
shouted occupiers go home at war veterans as they marched 
along gediminas avenue near a monument to gen ivan chernyakhovsky 
a soviet hero of world war ii 
the young people tried to block the path of the marchers who 
were apparently russians but a cordon of paratroopers prevented 
them said pranas karlonas a lithuanian radio editor 
soviet defense minister dmitri t yazov appearing on staterun 
tv in moscow complained about the attitude of the baltic 
republics which were annexed by the soviet union in 1940 overrun 
by german forces then retaken by the soviets we were greeted 
with flowers when the red army drove the nazis from the baltic 
republics said yazov 
when latvia declared itself independence it did not ask for an 
immediate break with moscow or suspend the soviet constitution 
like estonia it has set an unspecified transition period for 
secession 
latvians are waiting to see if the kremlin will impose economic 
sanctions and send troops to occupy some government buildings as 
it did to lithuania after that republics independence decree 
unlike in lithuania where the population is 80 percent ethnic 
lithuanian ethnic latvians are in a bare majority in the republic 
of 26 million people ethnic estonians make of 64 percent of the 
15 million people in their state 
in riga the victory day celebration began at midmorning with a 
military parade overseen by the commander of the entire baltic 
military district maj gen fyodor kuzmin in brief remarks to 
handpicked guests on the banks of the river daugava kuzmin 
denounced baltic independence saying we must overcome 
nationalist separatist and antisoviet tendencies 
ceremonial cannon fire boomed through the warm spring air 
signaling the beginning of a parade of troops artillery and 
armored vehicles on the 45th anniversary of the defeat of nazi 
germany 
marchers included several hundred paratroopers in blue berets 
whose presence in riga over the past several days has caused some 
concern 
pavel pedanov a 76yearold veteran watching the parade said 
recent political events in latvia spoiled the holiday 
he said he opposed independence because the people should be 
all together he lamented the denunciation by some balts of the 
soviet occupation in 1940 because they dont appreciate what we 
did 
veterans and officers marched toward the downtown victory 
monument and were met on the way by about 5000 residents who 
formed a separate civilian demonstration celebrating victory day 
and protesting secession 
most were speaking russian apparently members of the 
nonlatvian minority 
one protester held a sign that said secession is profitable 
only for nationalist careerists and political adventurers 
another read well support any leader who will impose order 
on the country and defend the ideals of socialism 
latvian lawmaker viktors alksnins urged the crowd to support a 
signature drive demanding a republicwide referendum on 
independence

prime minister yitzhak shamir said today that 
israel would not release any arab prisoners in return for western 
hostages unless israeli soldiers held in lebanon were also freed 
speaking for the first time about a possible prisonerhostage 
swap shamir said no progress had been made in efforts to secure 
the release of three israeli soldiers captured in lebanon in 1986 
asked about us hints that israel might free its shiite 
prisoners to facilitate the release of western hostages shamir 
said i dont think that anybody will ask israel to participate 
in such an endeavor without having a possibility to release our own 
prisoners and missing soldiers 
the three missing israeli soldiers are believed held by 
hezbollah or the party of god a proiranian shiite moslem group 
hezbollah is also believed to have links to the shiite 
extremists holding most of the 16 remaining western hostages 
including six americans 
when asked whether any progress had been made concerning the 
release of the israeli soldiers shamir said unfortunately not 
yet 
he spoke to reporters during a tour of a hightech factory in 
jerusalem 
israels military chief of staff lt gen dan shomron said no 
contacts were under way concerning a threeway swap involving 
israel the united states and the captors in lebanon 
shomron said in an interview broadcast today on israel radio 
that there have been no practical proposals for a prisoner swap 
he also said any deal that might materialize would have to 
include the release of the the three israeli soldiers held in 
lebanon 
when there is a readiness on the other side to return 
israeli prisoners we are prepared for an exchange this policy 
has not changed shomron said today there is nothing 
concrete where someone is talking to us about exchanges 
shomron was interviewed tuesday night at a reunion of hostages 
and soldiers from the 1976 entebbe rescue mission he noted that 
israel had the option of rescuing hostages with a military mission 
at the entebbe airport in uganda more than 100 passengers aboard 
an air france plane hijacked by palestinians were saved by a daring 
israeli commando operation 
in my opinion the israel defense forces can do it again even 
today the idf has units today that can do it maybe even better 
because they have better tools 
president bush has indirectly appealed to israel to free shiites 
as a goodwill gesture to encourage further releases of western 
hostages including six americans 
last month thanks in part to iran and syria shiite militant 
kidnappers in lebanon released americans frank herbert reed and 
robert polhill 
iranian officials have said the release of any more american 
hostages likely hinges on israels willingness to free moslem 
prisoners including sheik obeid a shiite cleric taken from his 
home in southern lebanon in 1989 
about 30 lebanese prisoners including shiite clergyman sheik 
abul karim obeid are held in israel the south lebanon army the 
lebanese militia trained and supplied by israel has more than 300 
mostly shiite prisoners in a south lebanon jail 
in addition to the shiites israel holds 9986 palestinians who 
were detained during the palestinian uprising against israels 
occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
former defense minister yitzhak rabin also interviewed at the 
reunion tuesday night said israel was prepared to use all its 
bargaining chips to win the release of its captives 
he said israels abduction of obeid from south lebanon in july 
was necessary to provide israel with a bargaining chip for a 
hostage swap 
my policy has been that when you have a hostage situation 
soldiers or civilians if theres a military option you use it if 
not then enter an exchange deal for that you have to have the 
cards rabin said

fierce shelling today by the forces of 
rival christian leaders gen michel aoun and samir geagea killed 20 
people and wounded 41 police said 
the barrages came after aoun threatened to attack ships using 
ports controlled by geagea 
on tuesday night 11 people died and 21 were wounded in fighting 
the casualties raised the overall toll to 972 killed and 2564 
wounded since the showdown for dominance of the christian enclave 
north of beirut broke out jan 30 
tuesdays deaths included brig gen francois zein commander of 
the military academy in the aounheld fayadiyeh suburb east of 
beirut zein 47 was killed when his office at the academy was hit 
in a barrage fired by geageas lebanese forces militiamen 
aouns threat to attack ports controlled by geagea was aimed at 
cutting off supplies for geageas lebanese forces militia 
a communique issued by aouns headquarters warned local and 
international maritime agencies against serving any port along 
the 28mile stretch of mediterranean coast in the enclave 
geageas headquarters said in a communique the warning was 
illegal because it was issued by an illegitimate side that 
usurped power the communique pledged severe response to any 
attack on a civilian ship 
smoke billowed from east beiruts district of ashrafiyeh 
geageas main stronghold and the pinewoods of the metn mountains 
where aouns troops are entrenched 
the thuds of exploding shells echoed across beirut as radio 
stations interrupted regular programming to report on the 
developments and blare appeals from hospitals for blood donations 
to cope with the influx of casualties 
geagea controls beirut harbor and the ports of jounieh and 
byblos north of the capital 
jounieh 12 miles from beirut is the terminal for a ferry and 
a hydrofoil from cyprus these vessels are the christians only 
outlet from their enclave which is ringed on its land sides by 
hostile syrian troops and their moslem militia allies 
aouns 19000man army controls only a threemile strip of the 
christian coast and he is not believed to have any working gunboats 
left from the heavy fighting with geageas militia of 6000 
fighters and thousands of reservists 
he has heavy artillery in the mountains overlooking beirut and 
the coast and has used it to fire on geageas flotilla of gunboats 
and armed speedboats 
but the guns are not radarcontrolled and the police spokesman 
noted it will be extremely difficult for aouns gunners to hit 
mobile targets especially speedboats 
the communique said aoun declared the coast between christian 
east beirut and the madfoun bridge in north lebanon a military 
operations zone 
sailing across it is banned to any vessel irrespective of its 
type or cargo the communique said 
geagea ordered his flotilla to blockade aouns only sea outlet 
at dbaye north of beirut on april 23 in an effort to prevent the 
general shipping in weapons and ammunition 
president elias hrawi and prime minister salim hoss drove to the 
syrian capital damascus for talks with president hafez assad on 
ways of implementing a peace plan to end lebanons 15yearold 
christianmoslem civil war 
aoun has rejected the arab leaguebrokered peace plan endorsed 
by lebanons parliament in the saudi arabian resort of taif in 
october because it does not guarantee the withdrawal of syrian 
forces from lebanon 
syria the main power broker in lebanon maintains 40000 troops 
in predominantly moslem regions under a 1976 arab league

next weeks launch of columbia with 
a 100 million observatory could be delayed days or even weeks 
because of a problem with the shuttle cooling system 
were trying to understand it and understand where we go from 
here william lenoir head of nasas space flight program said 
tuesday well probably fool with it another day or so before we 
make that decision 
columbia had been due to lift off may 16 or may 17 but a valve 
that controls the flow of coolant does not appear to be working 
properly nasa said 
if the valve has to be changed nasa would prefer replacing it 
at the launch pad where its never been done before said nasa 
administrator richard truly 
bascom murrah a nasa official in charge of prelaunch 
operations estimated it would be a 10day to twoweek hit to 
make the repairs on the pad because the system would have to be 
drained of coolant and cleaned 
rolling the shuttle back to its hangar to change the valve or 
another part could take even longer truly said 
during columbias nine to 10day flight the four astronomers 
in the sevenmember crew will operate the astro observatory which 
will probe sources of ultraviolet and xray radiation

vice president dan quayle hailed americas world 
war ii soldiers today as heroes who laid the groundwork for 
european unity but some veterans boycotted a ceremony because of 
quayles military record 
in remarks to about two dozen members of the american legion of 
paris the vice president praised dwight d eisenhowers vision of 
world peace 
eisenhower foresaw that the europe that existed in his time 
must change to reflect the fundamental principles that these heroes 
fought for principles that the united states and france have 
shared for some 200 years he said 
but one of the legionnaires present said that several people in 
his 750member organization declined to attend the ceremony at the 
american embassy because they believed quayle avoided combat duty 
during the vietnam war by joining the indiana national guard 
that bothers some of the members said a vietnam veteran who 
asked not to be identified but he could have gone to vietnam 
the massachusetts national guard was called up and they took heavy 
casualties 
roger lamtgne a decorated member of the 101st army division 
that parachuted into normandy on dday called his views on 
quayles military record personal 
but i will say that i think a man owes at least one time in 
his life to his country said lamtgne of lewiston maine who 
wore an i like ike button above his bronze star and purple 
heart earned during the dday landing 
quayle later met president francois mitterrand for talks to 
follow up the april 19 summit in key largo fla with president 
bush 
things are changing in europe quayle said after the 
45minute meeting theyre changing on the positive side of the 
ledger president mitterrand has a vision of where europe should be 
going his views are not only listened to but solicited 
the pair did not discuss the situation in lithuania but quayle 
praised a proposal by mitterrand and chancellor helmut kohl of west 
germany that the breakaway soviet republic suspend its declaration 
of independence and negotiate terms of secession with moscow 
it was very positive contribution to a very delicate 
situation quayle said we hope and anticipate this matter will 
be resolved without violence 
mitterrand supports a new european framework for security 
focusing on the 35nation conference on security and cooperation in 
europe foreign ministers from the conference meet in september to 
prepare a summit in late 1990 
the conference includes the united states canada and all 
european nations except albania 
quayles swing through rome london and paris marks his first 
official trip to europe since being elected in 1988 its purpose 
was to celebrate the 100th anniversary of eisenhowers birth and 
strengthen the atlantic alliance as the cold war barriers between 
east and west break down

ohio voters cast out rep donald buz lukens his long career 
shattered by his conviction on a sex offense while north 
carolinians boosted a black democrats bid to challenge 
conservative republican sen jesse helms 
never argue with the voters lukens said finishing a distant 
third in tuesdays gop primary which he entered over the 
objections of his partys leaders 
the loss following his conviction on charges of having sex with 
a 16yearold girl apparently ended a congressional career that 
spanned nearly 25 years 
on the busiest day of primary elections so far this year both 
helms and democratic sen jay rockefeller of west virginia coasted 
to easy victories and turned their attention to the general 
elections in november 
in other races 
ohio attorney general anthony j celebrezze jr picked up more 
than 80 percent of his partys vote to claim the democratic 
nomination for governor that sets up a november race against the 
republican nominee former cleveland mayor george voinovich 
west virginias former first lady dee caperton lost her shot 
at joining the administration of her exhusband gov gaston 
caperton when she was beaten in the democratic primary for state 
treasurer 
the indicted mayor of atlantic city nj james usry clinched 
a spot in a june 12 runoff by finishing second to a city councilman 
in a sevenway nonpartisan race 
former democratic reps katie hall of indiana and ken hechler 
of west virginia lost comeback bids in their old districts ms 
hall was beaten by rep pete visclosky and hechler lost to rep 
nick joe rahall jr 
a 100yearold eye doctor lost his race for congress in north 
carolina but wouldnt admit it i dont concede a damn thing 
harry merritt stenhouse said after being trounced by businessman 
don davis 
the big race in north carolina was the contest to select a 
democratic opponent for helms the flamboyant conservative who sets 
democrats nerves on edge 
helms had little trouble knocking off two gop challengers 
businessman george wimbish and salvage dealer lc nixon who could 
manage only 8 percent of the vote each with 99 percent of the 
precincts in helms had 84 percent or 155101 votes 
the top finisher in the democratic primary was former charlotte 
mayor harvey gantt who is hoping to become the first black senate 
nominee in north carolina in this century but gantt failed to win 
the 40 percent needed to avoid a june 5 runoff which secondplace 
finisher michael easley the brunswick county district attorney 
called for this morning 
thad beyle a political science professor at the university of 
north carolina at chapel hill said a runoff would be bad news for 
gantt 
i think if you go on the basis of the political history of the 
state if a liberal or a minority doesnt win it in the first 
primary theyll lose it in the second primary beyle said 
with 99 percent of the precincts reporting gantt had 257485 
votes or 38 percent to easleys 205972 votes or 30 percent 
they were trailed by john ingram a former state insurance 
commissioner with 118018 or 17 percent and rp bo thomas 
a former state senator with 80875 votes or 12 percent two other 
candidates ran far behind 
there was less suspense in tuesdays other senate contest in 
west virginia where republican attorney john yoder had no 
opposition and democrat rockefeller had little more 
with 89 percent of precincts reporting rockefeller had 176341 
votes or 84 percent to a combined 32551 votes for his opponents 
inventor ken thompson and conceptual artist paul nuchims 
ive won folks how about that rockefeller told about 50 
supporters at his campaign headquarters 
there was no celebration for lukens who has served in congress 
or the ohio state senate since 1967 his career began to unravel 
last year when he was convicted of a misdemeanor for having sex 
with a teenager and although he refused republican leaders 
advice to retire voters decided it was time 
according to final unofficial returns in western ohios 8th 
district state rep john boehner won with 25068 votes or 49 
percent followed by former rep thomas kindness with 16330 votes 
or 32 percent and lukens with 8681 votes or 17 percent mort 
meier a bond underwriter had 716 votes or 1 percent 
lukens said afterward that he has no immediate plans i really 
havent thought beyond tomorrow he said

the guidedmissile destroyer uss conyngham 
damaged by a fire so hot its decks were bubbling docked today 
at the norfolk naval station as the navy began investigating the 
blaze that killed a crewman 
eighteen other sailors including the no 2 officer were 
injured in the worst shipboard fire since a string of accidents 
prompted the navy to suspend operations for a twoday safety check 
in november a second navy man was killed in a separate accident on 
chesapeake bay 
six of the sailors with less serious injuries accompanied the 
ship back to port before going to the hospital said capt paul 
hanley atlantic fleet spokesman twelve others had been flown from 
the ship to hospitals 
the conyngham with a large scorch mark on its right side just 
above the water line docked at 230 am 21 hours after the fire 
erupted during routine operations about 100 miles southeast of 
norfolk said lt jg karl johnson an atlantic fleet spokesman 
the commander of a ship that helped the conyngham fight the 
blaze said today it was a major league fire that could have 
destroyed the warship 
capt joseph w perrotta jr skipper of the uss normandy said 
when he approached the conyngham smoke was pouring out of the 
ships forward stack area and bridge the normandy provided 
additional firefighting equipment and personnel to help the 
conyngham crew control the blaze 
the conyngham crew did a super job of putting out that fire 
perrotta said the ship could have been lost if not for the gallant 
effort of the crew 
about 200 family members and friends met the 383member crew 
which disembarked as work crews from other vessels boarded the 
conyngham to clear the vessels decks of water hanley said 
naval investigative service agents earlier were flown to the 
ship to help preserve evidence said cmdr deborah burnette an 
atlantic fleet spokeswoman 
the fire aboard the 27yearold ship started in the no 1 boiler 
room as the boiler was being fired up and spread to the ships 
nerve center said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
the fire spread to the combat information center spaces which 
caused the captain to evacuate the combat information center and 
the bridge temporarily leaving the ship without communications and 
dead in the water fitzwater said 
one of the injured was seaman james choss of hammond lake 
ind an electrician getting ready for bed after working most of 
the night in the combat information center his mother said 
one of the other guys in the room was hit by a fireball that 
singed his hair said elizabeth choss her son described hallways 
filled with smoke holes burned in the floor masks on firefighting 
gear that melted onto the faces of his shipmates and decks that 
were bubbling in the intense heat she said 
it was just trashed those were his words mrs choss said 
he said a fuel pump blew down in one of the boilers and 
thats what started the fire mrs choss said choss and his 
companions were unable to get out of their berth area right away 
because they couldnt get the hatch open she said 
the main fire was put out about 8 am about 2 hours after it 
started but the crew continued to fight smaller fires until 
shortly before noon the navy said the extent of damage was not 
immediately known 
killed was lt algernon pope gordon jr 34 of montgomery ala 
he was the ships operations officer in charge of collecting 
evaluating and disseminating tactical information 
three of the 12 sailors airlifted to hospitals were reported in 
guarded condition the rest in satisfactory condition including 
lt cmdr martin moody of indian head md the ships executive 
officer 
the ship started for home under its own power but its captain 
cmdr william r williams ordered the engines shut down as a 
precaution after a fuel leak was discovered ms burnette said 
shortly after noon the salvage ship uss opportune took the 
conyngham under tow 
in another accident tuesday a propeller broke apart and threw 
debris onto the deck of a navy hovercraft involved in a towing 
exercise at the mouth of chesapeake bay killing a crewman the 
navy identified the victim as petty officer 3rd class norbert 
thomas hanke of louisville ky no age was immediately available 
last fall the navy ordered a twoday standdown during 
which ships and installations reviewed safety procedures 
more than 100 navy personnel were killed on duty during 1989 
including 47 who died in a gun turret explosion aboard the 
battleship iowa from oct 11 to nov 22 13 serious accidents 
occurred four on nov 14 alone 
since the standdown fewer accidents have been reported navy 
officials said although no statistics immediately were available 
the 437foot ship was commissioned in 1963 a conventionally 
powered warship the conyngham is armed with harpoon antiship 
missiles and standard antiaircraft missiles torpedoes depth 
charges and two 5inch guns 
pentagon spokesman bob hall said he ship was scheduled to be 
decommissioned in 1991 he declined to say if it might be 
decommissioned sooner because of the damage 
in may 1987 the conyngham helped put out the fire on the uss 
stark and tow it to port after it was hit by missiles from an iraqi 
jet in the persian gulf sixty conyngham crew members were 
decorated for valor for their actions

and firebombs fought with riot police and set a us government 
building on fire today in the largest antigovernment protests in 
the capital since 1987 
violent protests demanding the overthrow of president roh 
taewoo also were staged in other cities 
police who fired tear gas canisters in seoul said dozens of 
officers and protesters were injured but gave no numbers it 
appeared no one was hurt in the fire at the us building 
the demonstrations came as the newly created democratic liberal 
party held its inaugural convention the students claim the party 
created by merging three political groups will lead to 
dictatorship 
fierce street battles broke out in central seoul as groups of 
300 to 2000 students dashed from sidewalks to occupy main streets 
around the fashionable shinsegye department store just before 
sunset 
about 2000 riot police in the area were outnumbered by columns 
of protesters surging down main boulevards leading to city hall and 
other government offices 
angry demonstrators overpowered at least two groups of 200 to 
300 riot police and seized their helmets clubs and shields some 
police were beaten up by protesters 
about 3000 students fought pitched battles with riot police 
near the us information service center in downtown seoul 
during the two hours of fighting students broke windows at the 
center and threw firebombs inside the first floor touching off a 
fire that burned out of control for more than an hour 
firefighters extinguished the blaze after police regained 
control of the street 
yankee go home students shouted as they hurled rocks at the 
fourstory building which houses a library and trade offices

cleaning crew might have been inside no damage estimate was 
available

students tried to break through lines of police blocking their 
march into the city center 
down with roh taewoo students shouted as they raced down 
the streets raising their clenched fists in the air 
by nightfall the demonstrators many armed with wooden sticks 
and rocks took control of several commercial streets in the heart 
of the capital a huge plaza in front of city hall was filled with 
tear gas and covered with rocks and broken bottles 
observers said the protests were the largest and most serious 
since nationwide antigovernment demonstrations in 1987 forced 
former president chun doohwan to carry out major democratic 
political reforms at that time hundreds of thousands of koreans 
took to the streets daily for three weeks 
earlier in the day police arrested nine students who tried to 
march on the us embassy in central seoul shouting 
antigovernment and antius slogans radicals claim us 
ambassador donald gregg a former cia seoul station chief was 
behind a plot by government conservatives to prolong their power 
beyond 1993 when rohs term ends 
roh took office in early 1988 after winning the countrys first 
direct presidential elections in 16 years 
in the central city of chongju about 100 students set fire to a 
police station and in nearby taejon students burned a police bus 
with firebombs the yonhap news agency reported 
in the southern city of kwangju an opposition stronghold about 
200 students wrote lets destroy the dlp dictatorship in blood 
on a huge placard during a campus rally the agency said

chunju cheju kongju and mokpo 
radicals had said they would stage violent antigovernment 
protests in 17 cities and the nations 130000 police were put on 
increased alert 
radical students and dissidents oppose rohs new governing 
political party which they say is dictatorial and undemocratic 
we can achieve nothing without national unity and harmony 
roh told about 8000 cheering supporters who filled an olympic 
gymnasium in southern seoul for the inauguration of the party 
it was formed in a merger of rohs old party with two moderate 
opposition groups early this year roh was chosen as party 
president during the convention 
roh said the threeparty merger an unprecedented alliance 
between governing and opposition parties will help stabilize the 
countrys politics which he said had been marked by confusion 
and confrontation

an american legion band didnt get to march 
through red square as planned but the musicians did strut down 
marx prospect today drawing hugs kisses and cheers from 
muscovites celebrating victory day 
bandleader dorothy hill 74 brought the 70member allmale 
band from american legion post 156 in waltham mass to the soviet 
union on a mission of peace 
mrs hill said band members had originally been led to believe 
from soviet officials that they would be the first us band to 
play in the main victory day military parade through red square 
celebrating the defeat of nazi germany 
but after the band arrived in moscow the soviet peace 
committee which is organizing their visit kept changing the 
americans schedule and finally they were informed that they 
wouldnt be able to march in the red square parade 
no explanation was immediately available for the change in 
schedule 
instead the band had to settle for taking part in another 
victory day parade in downtown moscow of marching musical units 
from various soviet republics 
and the americans proved to be a crowd favorite 
as the band marched down gorky street and turned onto 
cordonedoff marx prospect playing god bless america traffic 
police gave up trying to control the crowds thronging after the 
americans 
during the battle hymn of the republic one woman in the 
crowd running beside the band shouted back slava slava 
glory glory others gave the v for victory sign and 
waved their fists in a salute 
the band settled into seats in an open space next to the bolshoi 
theater for a concert and a crowd of about 1000 pressed around it 
so tightly that it had to be warned repeatedly to move back 
soviet war veterans wearing medals repeatedly hugged the 
american legion members wearing their military decorations 
during a onehour concert the band played when the saints go 
marching in yankee doodle dandy and old gray mare 
during which mrs hill twirled around jauntily to the music 
as they played hail massachusetts the band members put down 
their instruments and sang the chorus swinging down the avenue 
with colors on high well tell the whole creation that 
massachusetts passes by 
the crowd responded by improvising a chorus of moscow nights 
you see there is friendship and everybody is watching with 
pleasure thats why so many people are gathered here thanks to 
them said nikolai sidorenko a world war ii paratrooper 
after the concert the band members laid a wreath at the tomb of 
the unknown soldier who fell in world war ii 
summing up the trip mrs hill a world war ii coast guard 
veteran said it was far more than i ever expected to accomplish 
on a first visit 
richard giovangelo a band member from newtonville mass 
expressed some regret in not being able to march through red square 
i wanted to it was my impression that we were going to now 
that we didnt im somewhat disappointed he said but 
overall im satisfied

said the soviets had to meet two conditions before the united 
states would agree to stop turning out chemical weapons 
the first they said is to agree to a schedule to destroy the 
soviet stockpiles the other is to allow the united states to keep 
a small arsenal until all nations capable of production agree to a 
global accord 
initially bush last year offered to end production over eight 
years but now the officials said he is willing to set a date far 
short of that if the soviets meet the conditions 
secretary of state james a baker iii will explore prospects 
when he meets in moscow next week with soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze 
they are also to go over problems in other arms control fields 
the most difficult concern a proposed treaty to cut longrange 
nuclear missiles bombers and submarines by up to 50 percent on 
each side 
bush and gorbachev had hoped to sign such a treaty at their may 
30june 3 summit here but as the date draws close many 
differences remain these include a soviet demand to restrict 
multiwarhead missiles carried on warships the administration is 
resisting this and also insisting on retaining more airlaunched 
cruise missiles than the soviets have proposed 
a chemical weapons agreement at the summit would be historic and 
serve the political purpse of distracting attention from slow 
progress in other areas 
the united states now has about 32000 tons of poison gas us 
officials consider the soviet stockpile to be somewhat larger even 
though moscow announced in 1987 that it had stopped production 
while the reagan administration declined to end the us program to 
produce binary weapons this is a process of manufacturing two 
ingredients which are deadly when mixed 
even if the soviets agree to terms before or during the 
washington summit officials said the accord would begin to take 
effect some months later 
the first accounts of bushs chemical weapons initiative 
appeared in tuesday editions of the washington times

former charlotte mayor harvey gantt will face a 
runoff with a district attorney in his bid to become the first 
black nominated for the senate from north carolina this century 
with 99 percent of precincts reporting unofficial returns 
showed gantt leading brunswick county district attorney mike easley 
by 38 percent to 30 percent gantt was just shy of the 40 percent 
threshold needed for an outright nomination to face republican 
incumbent jesse helms in november 
its like kissing your sister at the last minute gantt said 
as the final precincts were counted we want to get the brass 
ring and its pretty close 
four other candidates on the democratic ballot split the 
remaining 32 percent of the vote in the republican primary helms 
easily defeated two opponents drawing 84 percent of the vote 
gantt who campaigned on the premise that a runoff would divide 
the party urged easley late tuesday not to let 1 or 2 percent 
divide us 
but easley called for a runoff in a news conference this morning 
at state democratic party headquarters 
we dont want to send our candidate into the fall armed with 
less than 40 percent of the vote easley said 
easley said he informed gantt this morning that he wanted a 
runoff which otherwise would not occur automatically under state 
law i dont think he expressed disappointment and i dont think 
he expressed any surprise he said 
gantt had no immediate comment on easleys announcement 
thad beyle a political science professor at the university of 
north carolina at chapel hill said a runoff would be bad news for 
gantt despite his firstplace finish 
i think if you go on the basis of the political history of the 
state if a liberal or a minority doesnt win it in the first 
primary theyll lose it in the second primary beyle said 
in congressional races 100yearold henry merritt stenhouse 
finished last in a threeway race for the republican nomination in 
the 3rd district but refused to concede before going to bed for 
the night dunn businessman don davis took the nomination to face 
incumbent democrat martin lancaster in november 
other incumbent congressmen who won renomination were democrats 
david price and bill hefner and republican cass ballenger

the united states which is trying to 
persuade north korea to negotiate with south korea has exchanged 
letters with officials in north koreas government sources said 
today 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the north 
sent a letter to washington via the soviet union and washington 
responded the united states does not have diplomatic relations 
with north korea 
the contents were not made public but washington and moscow 
have been encouraging the reclusive totalitarian north to work 
toward detente with capitalist south korea to ease tensions on the 
divided peninsula 
it was unclear whether this was the first such written 
correspondence between washington and north koreas government in 
pyongyang 
despite the collapse of communist regimes in eastern europe 
north korea remains closed and is one of the last hardline 
communist states 
word of the correspondence coincided with a threeday trip to 
seoul by the us assistant secretary of state for asian and 
pacific affairs richard solomon he met today with south korean 
foreign minister choi hojoong 
korean news reports said they discussed efforts to arrange talks 
between the koreas divided since 1945 
it was not known if the exchange of letters was discussed but 
one source close to the talks said it would not be wrong to 
assume it was 
american diplomats have met north korean officials in beijing 
seven times over the past year but us officials have said there 
has been little change in the norths attitude toward the south 
north korea invaded the south in 1950 to begin the korean war 
which ended three years later with an armistice not a peace treaty 
the two nations remain technically at war and the border 
between them is the most heavily fortified in the world the united 
states has 43000 troops in south korea under a mutual defense pact 
the soviet union is a longtime ally and arms provider of the 
communist north but in december established limited consular 
relations with south korea

bicyclists would be required to wear 
helmets under legislation passed by a maryland county council a 
law one safety expert said would be watched nationwide 
the legislation which goes into effect 150 days after it is 
signed by howard county executive elizabeth bobo would be the 
nations toughest helmet law howard county lies between baltimore 
and washington dc and has a population of 180000 
the county council approved the legislation 32 monday night 
bobo has indicated she will sign the legislation within the next 10 
days 
new york and california have limited helmet laws for children 
under 5 
the legislation should create a ripple effect nationally 
said dr andrew dannenberg of the johns hopkins injury prevention 
center 
andy clarke of the bicycle federation of america who had 
expressed concerns about the legislation at a public hearing 
agreed that passage of the bill will have a national impact for 
sure many jurisdictions will be watching to see if it works 
firsttime violators would be subjected to fines of up to 50 a 
second violation would carry a 100 fine if it occurred within 12 
months of the first but a judge could waive the fine if a cyclist 
showed proof of having purchased a helmet 
dannenberg said he will lobby for similar legislation on a state 
or national level 
i will also try to get support for having helmets included in 
the price of bicycles to increase the accessibility of helmets 
said dannenberg whose center will be monitoring the use of helmets 
in the county under the legislation 
the deaths of three youths in bicycle accidents in western 
howard county during the past three years prompted county 
councilman charles c feaga to introduce the bill 
clarkes organization had expressed doubt about whether the law 
would be accepted by the public he had said a major bikesafety 
education effort should be tried first 
about 600 children die each year nationwide in bicycle 
accidents and head injuries are the most common cause of death 
said fred rivara director of the harbor view injury prevention 
center in seattle 
rivara said a study by the seattle center showed that helmets 
would prevent 88 percent of the brain injuries suffered by cyclists 
helmets usually cost about 50 but rivara said some 
jurisdictions have gotten discounts from manufacturers that brought 
the cost down to as low as 20

the soviet union proudly paraded its military 
might through red square today marking the 45th anniversary of the 
defeat of nazi germany as kremlin leaders grapple with the 
reunification of their former foe 
world war ii veterans with red ribbons on their suits 
accompanied some of the tanks and artillery they fought with from 
moscow to berlin during the 30minute march past president mikhail 
s gorbachev and the rest of the soviet leadership standing atop 
lenins mausoleum 
the atmosphere was very different from the may 1 may day parade 
when thousands of loudly critical protesters poured through red 
square in front of gorbachev who walked off the tribunal with 
other soviet leaders 
defense minister dmitri t yazov who commanded a world war ii 
rifle regiment today credited gorbachevs new thinking with 
lowering the tension in europe divided between east and west after 
the war 
at the same time positive changes have not yet become 
irreversible he said in his orders for the parade military 
danger still exists in the world 
the celebration of victory day comes as eastern european 
countries freed by gorbachevs reforms are struggling to 
reestablish democratic rule and rebuild their economies after four 
decades of subservience to moscow 
soviet leaders are also facing secessionist movements in 
different republics and these tensions were reflected during 
victory day parades in the baltic republics of latvia and lithuania 
in riga the latvian capital 5000 people who oppose the 
secessionist movements in the baltics turned the victory day parade 
into rally against latvias declaration of independence on friday 
lt gen oleg zinchenko head of the political directorate of the 
baltic military region which includes latvia lithuania and 
estonia told the rally that the military wanted the kremlin to 
intervene in the three republics 
radio vilnius reported there were no confrontations between 
backers and opponents of lithuanias march 11 declaration of 
independence during a military parade through the lithuanian 
capital 
but a lithuanian radio editor said 200 young people shouted 
occupiers go home at war veterans as they marched down a 
vilnius street and paratroopers prevented the demonstrators from 
blocking the path of the marchers 
in the moscow parade the soviets drove five new pieces of 
military hardware through red square including their latest tank 
a t80 variant known to the west as the soviet medium tank 1989 
for the year it entered service said a nato military officer who 
attended the parade 
two new infantry vehicles were in the show a bmd2 airborne 
combat vehicle equipped with an antitank missile and a bmp3 
armored infantry vehicle with a doublebarreled cannon said the 
nato officer 
one ominouslooking weapon was the new sam10 surfacetoair 
missile mounted on a long truck that carries four missile 
canisters 
the soviets also displayed their bm22 multiple rocket launcher 
a truck mounted with a brace of 220mm rockets with a range of about 
24 miles said the western officer 
the soviet union and world war ii allies britain france and the 
united states are negotiating with east and west germany about 
reunification moscow seeks a neutral germany but the united 
states and its allies want a reunited germany to be part of the 
western nato alliance 
in a speech tuesday evening gorbachev reiterated that the 
soviet union supports german reunification and wants to cooperate 
with a new germany but the soviet union must be sure that in the 
future only peace will come from german soil he said 
gorbachev also used the speech to sharply criticize josef 
stalins conduct of the war and expressed hope that his summit 
meeting in washington with president bush at months end will lead 
to further disarmament and an easing of world tensions 
the soviet leader smiled waved and raised his clasped hands as 
he led the leadership onto the reviewing stand for the second time 
in eight days leaving the stand at the end of the parade he 
raised a bouquet of red and white flowers to the applause of the 
diplomatic corps that gathered to watch 
war veterans bedecked with rows of glistening medals marched in 
columns between military bands soldiers sailors paratroopers 
and kgb border guards 
the motorized portion of the parade opened with the rumble and 
smoke of twodozen vintage t34 tanks the tank was first produced 
in 1943 and helped push back the nazis from deep inside soviet 
territory 
overall the soviets showed 18 pieces of modern equipment 
driving them through red square in formations ranging from six to 
47 vehicles 
an american legion band from waltham mass had planned to 
become the first us band to take part in the parade through red 
square 
but the soviet peace committee which is organizing the bands 
visit kept changing their schedule after their arrival in moscow 
and finally informed the musicians that they would not be able to 
march in the main victory day parade 
instead the legionaires band marched in another victory day 
parade in downtown moscow with marching units from soviet republics 
and gave a concert outside the bolshoi theater 
no explanation was immediately available for the change in 
schedule

an attorney in the bensonhurst attack trial said 
his client was merely a jerk not a murderer but the 
prosecutor said the man showed a depraved indifference to human 
life by organizing an armed posse 
a jury resumed deliberations about 10 am today on whether 
keith mondello 19 a white was responsible for the shooting death 
of yusuf hawkins a black 16yearold on a brooklyn street aug 23 
at about the same time a second jury resumed deliberations on 
the case of joseph fama 19 the alleged gunman in the hawkins 
killing 
judge thaddeus owens who instructed the mondello jury tuesday 
afternoon has sequestered both panels 
according to testimony mondello organized the mob to attack the 
black and hispanic friends that he had heard a neighborhood girl 
planned to invite into the mostly white bensonhurst neighborhood 
hawkins and three friends happened to wander into the 
neighborhood to buy a used car the mob surrounded them and 
someone allegedly fama shot hawkins 
mondello and fama would face 25 years to life in prison if 
convicted of murder 
defense attorney stephen murphy said the incident was not 
motivated by race and sought to deflect the blame to gina 
feliciano 18 who he said invited her drugdealer friends to a 
party in the neighborhood 
murphy argued that mondello who admitted to being on the scene 
with a baseball bat had nothing to do with the murder 
as they were walking away some lunatic comes out and shoots 
him murphy said 
you might convict him of being a jerk murphy said he is 
a jerk he let her make a jerk out of him he let the cops make a 
jerk out of him but its no crime to be a jerk 
assistant district attorney paul burns countered that it was 
preposterous for mondello and the other young white men he had 
assembled to believe they had the right to arm themselves and go 
out on a public street to protect their neighborhood 
after one of the whites pulled an automatic pistol and fired 
four shots the mob of about 30 young men scattered without pausing 
to help their fatally wounded victim burns said 
he charged that mondello armed and set in motion the actions of 
the mob 
thats depraved indifference to human life burns said 
hes responsible under the law

prime minister yitzhak shamir said today he 
supports an emergency plan under which the government would spend 
an additional 1 billion to absorb 150000 jews expected in the 
coming year 
the extra spending is necessary because the numbers of soviets 
arriving has outgrown the estimates of israels budget planners 
the 1990 budget only earmarked enough funds to absorb 40000 
soviet jews during the fiscal year ending in march 1991 
updated figures suggest 150000 may arrive in this period more 
than 30000 soviet jews have come to israel since jan 1 
the plan to be presented to the cabinet on sunday estimates that 
israel needs 19 billion in fiscal 1990 to absorb the immigrants 
said finance ministry spokesman eli yosef he refused to give the 
number of immigrants on which the ministrys calculations were 
based 
but former deputy finance minister yossi beilin who worked on 
the emergency spending plan said it was based on 150000 soviet 
immigrants beilin left office along with other ministers of the 
centerleft labor party when the partys coalition with the 
rightwing likud bloc collapsed march 15 
asked whether his caretaker cabinet would approve the plan 
sunday shamir said i hope so if we are convinced that this is 
the program that is needed today in the period of big immigration 
we will approve it and make an effort to implement it he was 
speaking to reporters during a tour of a hightech factory in 
jerusalem that specializes in employing soviet scientists 
the influx of soviet jews has stirred alarm in the arab world 
where fears have been raised that the immigrants will be settled in 
the occupied territories and displace palestinians living there 
arab states have put pressure on the soviet union to restrict 
the emigration and as a result the kremlin has not allowed direct 
flights from moscow to israel instead most soviet jews fly to 
israel via east european countries such as a romania and hungary

three japanese balloonists trying to fly 
over mount everest from tibet to nepal crashlanded today after 
hitting a cliff in tibet and one was injured expedition officials 
said 
the balloon and the basket holding the three men also caught 
fire 
it was the first attempt to cross the worlds tallest mountain 
by balloon 
the balloon took off from nyalam situated at 14432 feet on the 
edge of the tibetan plateau in southwestern china said officials 
at the everest japanese balloon expedition committee headquarters 
in katmandu 
committee secretary general masashi kakuda said that when the 
balloon had traveled about six miles and reached an altitude of 
about 32000 feet the balloonists decided to land as soon as 
possible because the winds were not favorable for crossing the 
29028foot mount everest 
then they went down unfortunately their balloon hit a 
tall rock and the balloons envelope was torn later on the basket 
fell down several meters from the middle of the rock to the 
bottom kakuda added 
we didnt know what happened at that time there was fire on 
the basket and the balloon was half burned he said 
one of the pilots saburo ichiyoshi 43 of tokyo suffered leg 
injuries in the crashlanding kakuda said he said pilot michio 
kanda 41 and photographer atsushi saito 27 escaped uninjured 
kanda walked about six miles from the crashlanding site to 
nyalam kakuda said 
we have sent four rescue teams from nyalam to help the 
balloonists one of the rescue teams met kanda midway as of this 
evening two of the rescue teams already had reached the 
crashlanding site 
the expedition committee asked chinese authorities for 
permission to send two nepalese helicopters to pick up the 
balloonists on thursday

olive oil may be no better for the heart than 
corn oil for people on lowfat diets a new study suggests 
when someone is eating a reduced fat diet thats low in 
saturated fats it doesnt matter what kind of unsaturated fat they 
choose said darlene m dreon a research scientist at lawrence 
berkeley laboratory in berkeley calif 
previous research indicated that monounsaturated fats found in 
olive oil and peanut oil beneficially lower ldl cholesterol 
socalled bad cholesterol without lowering hdl socalled 
good cholesterol 
polyunsaturates such as in corn oil and safflower oil also 
lower bad cholesterol but they tend to lower good 
cholesterol as an unwanted additional effect previous research has 
indicated 
a 1985 study that prompted some consumers to switch from corn 
oil to olive oil involved a highly enriched diet because the 
experimenters hiked levels of unsaturated fats to measure them more 
easily 
in the new study dreon and colleagues found that neither 
polyunsaturated nor monounsaturated fats offered an advantage in 
maintaining levels of good cholesterol in the blood for people on 
lowfat diets 
hdl cholesterol is called good cholesterol because it is 
believed to protect against heart disease ldl cholesterol is 
called bad cholesterol because it is believed to contribute to 
fatty deposits in the arteries that promote heart disease 
excess total cholesterol in the blood is one of the three main 
modifiable traits that scientists have linked to an increased risk 
of developing heart disease the other two are high blood pressure 
and smoking 
researchers in the new study analyzed data on 20 women and 19 
men who were all put on a standard diet for two weeks then divided 
into groups for 12week diets alternately rich in monounsaturates 
and in polyunsaturates 
the standard diet was one recommended by the american heart 
association which calls for 30 percent of total calories from 
fats in contrast to the 40 percent of calories from fat that the 
average american eats 
the test diets provided the same proportion of calories from 
fats overall but restricted saturated fats the kind found in 
meat and dairy products to 10 percent the other 20 percent were 
polyunsaturates or monounsaturates depending on which test diet 
was being used 
blood levels of ldl cholesterol and hdl cholesterol did not 
change significantly with changing fat types the researchers 
reported in todays journal of the american medical association 
dr linda cashinhemphill an assistant professor at the 
university of southern california school of medicines 
atherosclerosis institute in los angeles said americans should aim 
for overall fat reduction 
there is no one magic bullet for fatty substances including 
cholesterol in the body she said in a telephone interview you 
have to control total fat

nasa engineers delayed until at least friday 
an attempt to snap the first photograph of stars using the main 
camera of the hubble space telescope the space agency said today 
nasa had said tuesday that they would try to get the first 
picture today even if engineers had to interrupt the telescopes 
shakedown tests now entering the third week 
but nasa spokesman dave garrett said today the first light 
picture will not be until at least friday 
garrett said he had no information about the reason for the 
delay other public affairs officers more closely connected to the 
hubble program were not available 
the first light picture is the traditional first photograph of 
the stars taken by a new telescope 
the plan would be to photograph a 3 billionyearold star field 
called theta carina or the ships keel visible in the 
southern sky the star cluster 1260 light years away can be seen 
with the naked eye from parts of africa south america and 
australia 
on tuesday ground controllers tried unsuccessfully to teach the 
telescope exactly what in the heavens it is looking at the 
instrument was told to look for stars of a certain brightness in 
what scientists thought was a rich field it found none 
it was somewhat of a surprise said michael harrington the 
nasa manager in charge of the checkout we had expected that this 
field has a plenitude of that size stars and that we had no problem 
getting plenty it didnt turn out quite like that 
once the telescope locks on to the bright stars it will 
remember where it was pointing and that in turn will enable it 
later to find any other target ordered by the ground 
the sequence is like looking at a map to determine your location 
and then being able to go to any point from there 
harrington said there probably were gaps in the star field 
without any stars of the brightness being sought we thought we 
had hit the field that was rich enough its not a problem with the 
instrument 
the 125ton telescope which cost 15 billion was released 
from the space shuttle discovery on april 25 before tuesdays 
failed effort engineers estimated they were one week behind 
schedule in their checkout because of earlier problems 
the telescopes mission is to collect the light generated by 
galaxies and other heavenly bodies billions of years ago it will 
enable astronomers to look far deeper into the universe than 
possible with groundbased telescopes 
teams of engineers are concentrating on two persistent problems 
on the telescope one is a jittery action when the instrument is 
instructed to roll the other is a shaking motion when the 
telescope passes from shadow into sunlight as it orbits the earth

referred to the house ethics committee allegations that walter 
fauntroy washingtons nonvoting congressional delegate hired a 
colleagues son for a noshow job 
the department which decided recently not to bring criminal 
charges against fauntroy following a lengthy investigation 
referred the matter for review by the house committee on standards 
of official conduct 
although there was no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by 
fauntroy there was information that the house ethics committee 
might want to look at said spokesman david runkel who declined

fauntroy ddc was the subject of a 15month investigation by 
the department into allegations that he had hired the son of rep 
gus savage dill for a noshow job 
thomas savage was on fauntroys payroll from september 1987 
through june 1988 except for an unpaid leave of absence a period 
when he said he went to illinois to run for the legislature 
under house rules congressional employees must work in 
washington or in the district the member represents 
runkel said a parallel investigation of gus savage had also been 
closed for lack of evidence to warrant any prosecution but the 
matter also was referred to the house ethics committee 
the justice department examined whether the elder savage was 
aware of any possible wrongdoing in fauntroys hiring of his son 
said sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the washington post today quoted unidentified sources as saying 
the justice departments public integrity section believed there 
were some things the ethics committee might want to look at in 
the case of savages son 
a spokesman for fauntroy abbe lowell told the post that 
referral to the committee was routine in such cases saying the 
department has done no more and no less than follow their normal 
practices 
jan keyes a spokeswoman for the ethics panel declined to 
comment on whether it would open an investigation 
fauntroy is a candidate for mayor in this falls election and 
may not seek reelection to his house seat

a new car navigation system that uses satellites to 
plot a vehicles location and displays it to the driver on a 
computer map will go on sale next month in japan a company said 
wednesday 
the device is the first such system available on the retail 
market said toru yokomizo spokesman for pioneer electronic corp 
the system which goes on sale june 21 connects to a cars 
audio system and uses special compact discs to display color maps 
of any part of japan yokomizo said 
the avic1 device uses signals from satellites to automatically 
calculate the vehicles location it indicates the location with a 
red dot on the maps which are displayed on a fourinch flat color 
screen he said 
the driver can choose from five levels of detail in the maps 
which also include names of thousands of restaurants hotels and 
entertainment facilities and the services they provide he said

former hostage frank reed is expected to 
remain hospitalized for another week but he is in good spirits 
sleeping well and starting to regain some of about 50 pounds he 
lost according to a medical report 
the air force said tuesday a battery of medical tests has tired 
the 57yearold educator so his examination schedule is being 
spread out over more days he went into the hospital at andrews air 
force base in maryland on friday four days after his middle east 
kidnappers released him april 30 
another former hostage and fellow educator robert polhill 
underwent a biopsy tuesday at walter reed army medical center for a 
growth on his left vocal cord 
jim stueve a hospital spokesman said the findings were 
expected in several days polhill 55 was freed april 22 
reeds doctors had said he probably would be able to return to 
his native massachusetts by the end of this week but that has been 
revised to next week 
the air force gave no further details on reeds physical or 
mental condition citing his request for privacy spokesmen 
referred reporters to a family friend carroll lowenstein who they 
said was helping him deal with media requests for interviews 
lowenstein did not answer his telephone tuesday night 
reed told a news conference sunday that his islamic kidnappers 
savagely beat him breaking his nose jaw ribs and feet and 
bloodying his kidneys during his 44 months in captivity 
thank god they didnt kill me he said i was one of their 
pet whackers 
in the middle east hussein musawi a shiite moslem 
fundamentalist said in an interview with the communistrun voice 
of the people radio that he did not expect the hostage issue to be 
resolved this year 
he said the united states has not responded with a goodwill 
gesture of its own for the release of reed and another former 
hostage robert polhill within eight days of each other last month 
peggy say the sister of hostage terry anderson has urged 
israel to release shiite detainees to help win the freedom of the 
remaining six american and 10 other western hostages 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press is the longest held of the hostages he was kidnapped march 
16 1985 
mrs say made her request on behalf of the hostages at a meeting 
with ambassador moshe arad at his residence on april 27 
we also have soldiers of ours that are in the hands of the 
hezbollah and we have other soldiers who are still missing in 
action ruth yaron a spokeswoman for the israeli embassy said 
tuesday 
israel is willing to release those detainees that are held by 
us for terrorist actions if this could bring about the release of 
all israeli prisoners as well as the release of the western 
hostages she said 
the embassy said the detainees held by israel are terrorists 
not hostages 
there is no room for any comparison between them and the 
hostages who are innocent citizens kidnapped by the hezbollah 
organization and lebanese organizations affiliated with it the 
embassy said 
syrian and iranian officials have said the release of any more 
american hostages likely hinges on israels willingness to free 
moslem prisoners including sheik obeid a shiite cleric taken from 
his home in southern lebanon in 1989

president fernando collor de mello said 
today up to 400000 public employees could be fired as part of his 
economic reform program 
the economic modernization of the country cannot proceed 
without deep government reform the president said after a 
cabinet meeting 
he estimated that 16 million people work for the federal 
government or for governmentcontrolled firms 
from now on we will proceed with a reduction of 20 to 25 
percent of this number through firings and by placing excess 
workers in availability collor said in brasilia the capital 
in availability is a brazilian legal term that means civil 
servants stay at home and draw only partial salaries the premise 
is that eventually they will become disgusted and quit 
collor did not give further details of the layoffs 
previous presidents threatened deep cuts in the government 
payroll but never really followed through it appears that collor 
was more determined than previous leaders however 
the 40yearold leader also said today he will move ahead with 
promises to privatize many of brazils 188 staterun firms many of 
which lose money and together have a debt of 62 billion many also 
serve as job havens for friends and relatives of politicians and 
appointees 
the public sector will continue operating only in areas 
considered to be of strategic importance for the economy collor 
said 
collor was inaugurated march 15 for a fouryear term after 
becoming brazils first popularly elected president since 1960 he 
campaigned on a pledge to reduce government waste 
in his first day in office he announced that 23 federal 
companies foundations and institutes would be shut down and that 
more than 11000 federal employees holding more than one government 
job would have to quit their extra employment he also froze 115 
billion in savings accounts and money market deposits for 18 months 
collor has said those measures and spending cuts are necessary 
to bring down record inflation of 4854 percent during the past 
year and eliminate a federal deficit of 31 billion 
the actions have drastically cut the cost of living but the 
economy still appears headed for a recession

two new reports conclude that the experimental 
drug ddi is a promising weapon against aids but a top government 
researcher cautions doctors and patients to suspend judgment 
until much larger studies are finished 
the latest work found that the medicine improved aids patients 
blood counts increased their energy and helped them put on weight 
but it also shows that the treatment can cause severe even 
lifethreatening side effects 
there is some evidence that it inhibits the aids virus said 
dr howard a liebman of boston city hospital the important 
question is will the spectrum of toxicity prove to be the limiting 
factor of the drug will that make it not any better than azt and 
perhaps worse 
doctors hope that and other questions about ddi will be answered 
by a major new study under way at hospitals across the united 
states 
the two newly published studies were conducted on small numbers 
of patients by doctors at boston city hospital and the university 
of rochester the results published in thursdays new england 
journal of medicine were similar to those of a national cancer 
institute preliminary study published last july in the journal 
science 
all three studies were socalled phase i trials they were 
intended to determine the maximum safe dose that patients can 
tolerate not whether the medicine had an effect on their illness 
nevertheless the researchers found that many of the patients 
clearly improved while taking ddi for a few weeks 
in an editorial in the new england journal the director of aids 
work at the national institutes of health wrote that there 
certainly is a suggestion of shortterm benefit from ddi 
currently about 800 patients are enrolled in a study that 
compares ddi to azt or zidovudine the only aids medicine approved 
by the us food and drug administration for routine use an 
additional 8600 people who cannot take azt because of side effects 
or worsening symptoms are using ddi in an unusual program that 
makes the drug available before its formal approval 
in the editorial dr anthony s fauci predicted that the two 
latest reports will stir up inevitable enthusiasm about the 
treatment 
but he added physicians and patients should suspend judgment 
about ddi until the multicenter phase iiiii clinical trials 
currently in progress are completed 
the new england journal studies were directed by drs john s 
lambert of rochester and timothy p cooley of boston city and 
involved 71 patients many of the patients felt better or put on 
weight while taking ddi virus levels fell while the blood cells 
attack by the aids virus increased 
however high doses of the drug also caused inflammation of the 
pancreas and severe foot pain 
liebman who was senior author of the boston city study said 
the potentially fatal pancreatic ailment often occurred after three 
or four months of ddi treatment and frequently affected the sickest 
patients 
physicians have to be very alert to the toxicities he said 
a lot of physicians are not sensitive to this they are just 
happy to be able to give something to their patients 
even if ddi turns out to be no better than azt it still may be 
an alternative drug for some patients azt often loses its 
effectiveness after a year or so of treatment it also suppresses 
the bodys ability to make new blood cells 
also in the journal dutch doctors reported an unsuccessful 
attempt to prevent an accidental aids infection by giving azt the 
victim a patient in the hospital for an intestinal operation was 
mistakenly given an injection with a syringe that contained a small 
amount of aidstainted blood 
doctors quickly recognized their mistake and began giving him 
azt within 45 minutes however the drug failed to stop the virus 
and the man became infected 
azt is routinely recommended to prevent infections in hospital 
workers who accidentally jab themselves with needles that have been 
used on aids patients the report written by dr joep ma lange 
and others from the university of amsterdam shows that the 
strategy may not always work

the recording industry today unveiled a 
uniform voluntary parental warning label for albums that might 
contain explicit lyrics 
jay berman president of the recording industry association of 
america told a news conference that the blackandwhite label will 
appear on the lower righthand corner of possiblyobjectionable 
records cassettes and compact discs reaching retail stores 
starting in july 
we believe the uniform logo will enhance the existing 
voluntary system and better respond to the legitimate concerns of 
parents berman said 
now that we have agreed on this new logo it will be up to 
parents to use it as they see fit he said 
the standard label which reads parental advisory explicit 
lyrics will appear on albums at the discretion of record 
companies and individual artists 
plans for the label were announced in late march at a convention 
of the national association of recording merchandisers which 
endorsed the idea at todays news conference 
that association representing record retailers and distributors 
across the country said our members hope that this voluntary 
step by the recording industry will put the nightmare of 
governmental regulation behind us 
berman said that by his count 16 of the 19 states considering 
legislation requiring warning labels on records have backed away 
from those efforts since the industry promised to institute a 
uniform label on a voluntary basis 
the voluntary labeling plan had previously been endorsed by 
tipper gore president of the parents music resource center and 
ann lynch president of the national pta as a better answer to 
parents concerns about explicit lyrics than mandatory labeling 
the new system is intended to alert consumers to recordings that 
could be deemed objectionable because of explicit lyrics dealing 
with sex violence suicide and substance abuse 
the voluntary labels also were endorsed at the news conference 
by daddy o of the rap group stetsasonic who said he was the father 
of five children 
we dont think the government should determine what our 
children listen to daddy o said we all think the label is 
cute 
berman said he anticipated that virtually all of the recording 
industry associations members would subscribe to the labeling plan 
record distributors which committed themselves to the new 
labeling last month were warner bros mca cbs capitolemi rca 
and polygram the six largest recording industry companies 
companies belonging to bermans trade association produce more 
than 90 percent of the records sold in the united states many of 
the records deemed objectionable by critics are released by small 
independent companies that are not association members 
the uniform label replaces a system under a 1985 agreement that 
involves individual record company warning labels erratic 
compliance under that agreement created confusion among parents 
groups

lawyers for three futures traders accused of 
fraud will be allowed to introduce at their trial evidence 
suggesting that the difference between legal and illegal trading is 
blurry 
the ruling by us district judge ann c williams was a victory 
for defendants robert d mosky danny l scheck and david zatz 
jury selection which began tuesday resumed today for the 
trial which is expected to last six weeks 
mosky scheck and zatz traded swiss franc futures on the chicago 
mercantile exchange they were indicted last year along with 44 
other chicago futures traders and a clerk on charges of defrauding 
customers 
sixteen of those indicted have pleaded guilty to reduced charges 
in return for their cooperation 
mosky scheck and zatz face more than a dozen counts each of 
fraud and violations of the commodity exchange act each count 
carries up to five years in prison and a 150000 fine 
mosky also is charged with racketeering conspiracy for which he 
could be sent to prison for 20 years and be forced to forfeit 
assets including his exchange membership 
the judge ruling on several motions monday and tuesday said 
that if the evidence shows the line between legal and illegal 
trades is sufficiently blurry it can be introduced 
defense lawyers have indicated they will challenge the ability 
of the prosecution witnesses to discern legal and illegal trading 
the governments case hinges on the testimony of two traders and 
on the observations and taperecordings of an fbi agent who posed 
as a corrupt trader 
swiss franc futures are contracts to buy or sell specified 
amounts of the currency on future dates at prices agreed upon in 
advance

it may make some people uncomfortable but 
change is necessary and is coming at the post office postmaster 
general anthony frank said wednesday 
we have to have the foresight and the courage to take 
responsibility for our future frank told a senate post office 
and governmental affairs subcommittee 
it is not going to be placid waters smooth sailing and 
huzzahs all around said frank who was not specific about 
changes 
the postal waters have been decidedly choppy in recent weeks 
following reports of some planned reductions in service standards 
at the same time the agency is seeking a rate increase 
higher postal prices including a 30cent first class stamp 
are expected to take effect next year 
frank told the subcommittee however that postal costs have 
been held below inflation for the first half of the current fiscal 
year and work efficiency in the organization has increased for 
three consecutive quarters 
mail volume and delivery points have increased slightly over the 
last year but the postal service now has 19000 fewer career 
employees than a year ago said frank 
at the same time he said the agency is 361 million in the 
black for this fiscal year although it is expected to fall into 
the red as the normal summer and fall decline in mail volume occurs 
frank noted the postal service will begin negotiating new 
contracts this summer with its major unions and said changes in the 
way workers are used may be discussed he did not get into 
specifics however 
increased automation will also have a great impact on the 
future especially the use of bar codes on virtually all mail bar 
codes resemble the rows of lines used for computerized supermarket 
pricing and will allow mail to be handled more easily by machines

the number of americans old enough to vote 
this fall is up more than 36 million from two years ago but the 
odds are fewer will actually turn out 
the nations votingage population will climb to 186382000 by 
novembers election the census bureau projected on wednesday 
thats up from about 1827 million two years ago the bureau 
said 
but the absence of a presidential contest this year means there 
will probably be less public interest and so a lower turnout 
an estimated 501 percent of votingage americans voted for 
president in the 1988 general election in 1986 the last 
congressional election year without a presidential vote only 334 
percent voted 
the new census report shows the aging of the giant postworld 
war ii baby boom generation is continuing to place the bulk of 
voters in the 25to44 age group 
that segment of americans will make up 439 percent of eligible 
voters up from 435 percent two years ago and 385 percent in 1980 
the smaller generation that followed the baby boom means the 
younger age group is losing potential political influence 
voters aged 18to24 will be only 138 percent of those eligible 
this fall down from 145 percent in 1988 and 184 percent in 1980 
the middle aged those 45 to 64 will be 252 percent of voters 
down from 253 percent in 1988 and 273 percent in 1980 
but voters aged 65 and over will be 17 percent an increase from 
167 percent two years ago and 157 percent in 1980 
women will outnumber men in the voting age population by 971 
million to 892 million the report shows 
men have a slight edge in the 18to24 group but women 
outnumber them at older ages as women tend to live longer than 
men the biggest margin is at age 65 and over with 188 million 
women and 129 million men 
the votingage population will include 211 million blacks and 
61 million persons of other races such as asians pacific 
islanders and american indians 
although the report lists all americans aged 18 and over as part 
of the votingage population the bureau noted not all are eligible 
to vote included are about 66 million legal aliens 28 million 
illegal aliens and 850000 persons in prisons or mental hospitals 
who are not eligible to vote

nato defense ministers met today to 
discuss slashing their arsenal of battlefield nuclear weapons now 
that political changes in eastern europe have dramatically reduced 
eastwest tensions 
the officials of the north atlantic treaty organization gathered 
in the majestic rocky mountains of western canada for their first 
nuclear strategy talks since prodemocratic revolutions swept 
through eastern europe last year 
upon arrival tuesday the alliances secretarygeneral manfred 
woerner described the discussions as very important in laying 
the groundwork for a more peaceful more secure future 
we will start adjusting our nuclear posture to the future 
to make sure that we continue to prevent war with less weapons 
and hopefully also with less soldiers he said 
just days before the meeting president bush announced the 
cancellation of plans to build a more powerful shortrange nuclear 
missile and a modernized 155mm nucleartipped artillery shell 
even before the american decision there was a growing feeling 
among nato diplomats that the west could safely reduce if not 
eliminate entirely its arsenal of landbased tactical missiles and 
artillery in europe 
those weapons most deployed in west germany were designed to 
hit targets in countries of eastern europe that have now improved 
ties with the west 
german defense minister gerhard stoltenberg on his arrival late 
monday said it was possible that all landbased nuclear systems in 
europe would be withdrawn of course he told reporters the 
requirement is the readiness of the soviet union to withdraw their 
own systems 
it cannot be unilateral he said it must be on both 
sides 
it was unclear if the defense ministers meeting as the nuclear 
planning group would announce changes in their nuclear arsenal at 
this meeting 
some officials thought it more likely nato would delay any 
announcements until the end of a series of highlevel meetings this 
month and next on the alliances future and its need for nuclear 
and conventional forces 
the discussions will wind up with a summer summit of bush and 
other leaders of the 16 nations

the fire that killed one sailor and injured 
18 on a guidedmissile destroyer was so hot it made the decks 
bubble and melted firefighters breathing masks on their faces 
it was a major league fire that could have destroyed the 
27yearold uss conyngham said capt joseph w perrotta jr 
skipper of a rescue vessel 
the navy declined to comment on a possible cause of the fire 
one of two fatal incidents on navy ships tuesday 
navy officials said the fire started early tuesday in the 
forward boiler room when the boiler was being lit fire and smoke 
spread quickly upward filling berthing areas the command 
information center and the bridge the command information center 
is the ships nerve center with communications radar and sonar 
the conyngham docked early wednesday 21 hours after the fire 
erupted about 100 miles southeast of norfolk said lt jg karl 
johnson an atlantic fleet spokesman 
portholes were broken out along the right side of the vessel and 
a 12footlong scorch mark was visible just above the waterline at 
midship 
perrotta skipper of the uss normandy said that when his ship 
approached the conyngham smoke was pouring out of the ships 
forward stack area and bridge the normandy provided additional 
firefighting equipment and personnel to help the conyngham crew 
control the blaze 
cmdr william r williams the conynghams skipper had ordered 
the affected spaces evacuated leaving the ship dead in the water 
and without communications and formed firefighting crews perrotta 
said 
the main fire was extinguished in about 2 hours by the ships 
383man crew but sailors continued to monitor conditions because 
of the intense heat held by the aluminum decks and bulkheads 
perrotta said 
the ship could have been lost if not for the gallant effort of 
the crew he said 
seaman james choss an electrician aboard the ship and one of 
the injured told his mother he was getting ready for bed after 
working most of the night in the combat information center when the 
fire broke out 
he said a fuel pump blew down in one of the boilers and 
thats what started the fire elizabeth choss said from her home in 
hammond ind 
one of the other guys in the room was hit by a fireball that 
singed his hair said mrs choss she said her son described 
hallways filled with smoke holes burned in the floor masks on 
firefighting gear that melted onto the faces of his shipmates and 
decks that were bubbling in the intense heat 
after the main fire was put out the conyngham was able to get 
under way on its own but williams shut down the boilers when a 
fuel leak was discovered the ship was towed back to port where it 
was met by about 200 crewmembers family and friends when it docked 
while the ship was in tow a team of naval investigative service 
agents was flown to the vessel to begin looking for the cause of 
the fire said lt cmdr deborah burnette a us atlantic fleet 
spokeswoman the commander of destroyer squadron 10 capt raymond 
sharpe jr will head the investigation of the accident 
killed in the fire was lt algernon pope gordon jr 34 of 
montgomery ala gordon was the conynghams operations officer in 
charge of collecting evaluating and disseminating tactical 
information 
twelve of the 18 injured where flown to the portsmouth naval 
hospital and to a hospital trauma center six others walked off the 
ship when it docked 
navy officials said none of the injuries were serious and five 
crewmembers were released from the naval hospital wednesday 
at the mouth of chesapeake bay on tuesday petty officer 3rd 
class norbert thomas hanke of lousiville ky died after being 
struck by debris when the propeller of a hovercraft disintegrated 
the accident occurred during small boat manuevers

cockroaches centipedes and crabs are 
skittering on teensyweensy treadmills to help scientists learn 
more about how the little critters get from here to there 
so far biologist robert fulls research team has found that 
insects run rather than walk and that cockroaches beetles dogs 
and humans all use the same basic gait when they run 
crabs however gallop 
fulls laboratory at the university of california berkeley 
contains a series of miniature treadmills in airtight plastic 
boxes air tubes connected to the boxes allow full and his students 
to measure ittybitty amounts of oxygen consumed by jogging 
cockroaches 
the scientists also can measure the force exerted by insects 
individual footfalls 
each insect or crab is put through its paces for 10 to 15 
minutes at a time in a series of tests lasting a couple of weeks 
full found the amount of energy a creature uses getting from one 
place to another has nothing to do with how many legs it has or 
even how smoothly it runs or walks 
instead energy expenditure depends on the amount of force 
produced by leg muscles and the amount of time it takes each leg to 
go through a whole cycle of movement 
this seems to be true all the way from an awkward marathon 
winner to a centipede weaving over the ground full said 
researchers also learned that the energy required to walk or run 
depends largely on the force needed to hold the body up against 
gravity and not so much on mechanical power needed to swing the 
legs and propel the body forward

a judge today ordered the army corps of 
engineers to bow to the wishes of three states and limit releases 
of water from lake oahe until june 1 in order to protect fishing 
us district judge patrick conmy granted a request by north 
dakota south dakota and montana to stop the corps from lowering 
the reservoir by 3 feet until the end of the month the states 
contend the may release of water from lake oahe wipes out the 
lakes walleye spawn 
the corps filed a notice today that it will appeal us 
attorney steve easton said 
officials of the three states said the legal dispute reflects 
growing anger at the corps management of the entire missouri 
system during a drought now entering its third year in the upper 
great plains 
the fish spawn are symptomatic of a much bigger problem 
said former south dakota gov william janklow attorney for the 
three states thats the neglect the abuse and the disregard 
that ofttimes comes from people within the bureaucracy that make 
decisions 
the lake is in north and south dakota montana joined in 
contending the corps is managing the system in favor of navigation 
in lower basin states to the detriment of recreation and wildlife 
in upper basin states 
charles findlay a justice department attorney representing the 
corps argued tuesday that conmy had no authority to dictate how 
the agency should manage its system of six missouri river dams 
but conmy said today he was unwilling to accept an 
interpretation that would place any governmental agency beyond the 
scope of judicial review of actions having a direct economic effect 
upon thousands of citizens 
the corps has many complex considerations to make in deciding 
how to handle the system findlay said arguing that conmys order 
would not be in the public interest 
if the lake falls dramatically walleye eggs laid in shallow 
water will be exposed and destroyed janklow argued tuesday before 
conmy 
that would deal a 20 million blow to dakota tourism said 
janklow 
we dont live in wealthy states we have very limited 
economic opportunities available to us he told conmy 
the three states request would effectively end shipping in the 
missouris navigation channel which stretches from sioux city 
iowa to st louis the corps attorney said 
shipping contributes only 14 million in benefits to the system 
compared with 67 million in benefits from fishing and recreation 
janklow said 
the states request also could harm the nesting of two federally 
protected rare birds the piping plover and interior least tern he 
said 
janklow countered the birds would not be affected

hearing as did top attorneys from the dakotas montana nebraska

the bush administration opposes setting up an 
international fund to help poor countries decrease their production 
of ozonedepleting chemicals known as chlorofluorocarbons the 
white house said today 
while the administration wants socalled cfcs eliminated and 
believes financial assistance should be made available to help 
developing countries do that president bush feels that resources 
in existing international agencies are sufficient to handle it 
said white house spokesman roman popadiuk 
the idea of a 100 million special fund to help developing 
nations was to be raised at an international conference on cfcs 
which us representatives are attending in geneva according to 
the washington post the newspaper said the proposal seeks money to 
help the third world countries convert to alternative chemicals and 
identify ways to replace cfcs 
cfcs are used widely for refrigeration and some aerosol 
products and their emission is depleting the ozone layer that 
protects the earth from harmful ultraviolet rays 
the united states believes that the health of the global 
environment is everyones responsibility and must be addressed we 
support a worldwide phaseout of cfcs popadiuk said in a prepared 
statement the united states agrees that financial assistance 
should be made available to help developing countries phase out 
production of cfcs however we believe it is more sensible to use 
existing institutions and existing financial mechanisms already 
established by the world bank 
it would not be sensible he said to set up a new fund that 
would create new rules regulations and procedures that will have 
to be negotiated for every new protocol 
the world bank should use existing resources he said 
he did not elaborate on how the world bank might reroute 
existing resources for the effort 
the administration has come under criticism by environmentalists 
previously for what they say is footdragging on the question of 
eliminating cfcs and failing to keep up with the leadership of more 
aggressive european nations 
the administration endorsed the idea of phasing out cfcs last 
year after it was proposed by europeans

soviet world war ii veterans wednesday celebrated 
their defeat of the nazis 45 years ago but worried that a reunited 
germany could once again threaten their homeland 
a senior naval officer thought a reunified germany so repulsive 
he responded angrily when asked about the issue i killed germans 
then and if i have to ill kill them again he refused to give 
his name and stormed off 
thousands of grayhaired veterans took advantage of bright 
spring weather to don their uniforms pin on their medals and 
gather in parks to recall the conflict they call the great war for 
the fatherland 
it was their first victory day celebration since east germanys 
hardline communist leader erich honecker was swept from power the 
berlin wall was opened and negotiations began on reuniting east and 
west germany 
most of the halfdozen veterans interviewed in sverdlov square 
outside the bolshoi theater after an official military parade in 
nearby red square said they would tolerate a reunited germany only 
if it were neutral belonging neither to the nato nor warsaw pact 
military alliances 
im not against the reunification of germany but i am against 
war with germany making sure it is not repeated said retired 
air force lt ivan d morozov who said he met us soldiers on the 
elbe river in germany at the close of the war 
asked which alliance germany should join he said it 
shouldnt be in any bloc there just should be peace on earth so 
people dont know war 
morozov held red tulips and wore a brown jacket with four rows 
of silver and gold medals nearby a group of women accompanied by 
an accordion sang of the heroism of soviet soldiers 
gen ivan petrov who served on the ukrainian front said he 
also believed germany should be neutral if its citizens choose that 
course 
let the german people decide themselves said petrov who 
was interrupted by children giving him flowers 
he echoed the kremlin compromise suggestion that if a reunited 
germany could not avoid joining one military alliance it should 
remain in both 
soviet officials have suggested that a united germany belong to 
both the north atlantic treaty organization and the warsaw pact 
until undefined european security structures are created to 
maintain stability bonn and washington reject this saying germany 
should belong only to nato 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze has said his 
people should have a special say in discussions on german 
reunification because they suffered so much in world war ii twenty 
million soviets were killed 
fears abounded among the veterans that a reunited germany could 
become an aggressor 
unification is good but there must be a guarantee of the 
security of all people especially those who suffered the most from 
hitler its in the center of europe so it must be a peaceful 
country said col vasily kovalev 63 an artillery regiment 
commander kovalev wore a dark green dress uniform and held orange 
and red tulips 
nearby lt konstantin trepakov said in broken english that the 
wartime allies the soviets french british and americans would 
join again to fight germany if it became a threat 
a wartime buddy lt col konstantin palkin interrupted im 
skeptical i dont exclude the possibility of german revenge our 
world war ii allies wont allow that 
another veteran standing in the group wearing a blue 
paratroopers beret said he did not believe a neutral germany 
would be safe 
it could develop strongly on its own and could not be 
controlled by the americans or anyone else said the veteran who 
did not give his name

president bush and congressional leaders 
agreed today to open negotiations on a deficitreduction package 
that may include tax increases as well as deep spending cuts 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater announced the talks after 
senate and house leaders met with bush for more than an hour in the 
oval office to discuss the widening 1991 budget gap 
fitzwater said the negotiatations would begin next tuesday he 
said whether taxes are included in any compromise was a matter 
for the negotiators to consider 
although bush won the white house pledging no new taxes he 
abandoned that pronouncement this week in face of the spiraling 
federal deficit 
severe action needs to be taken fitzwater said today 
blaming the nations worsening deficit situation on rising interest 
rates reduced revenues to the treasury and a previous 
underestimate of the costs of the savings and loan bailout 
the table is clean fitzwater said suggesting that tax 
increases could be part of the eventual compromise we are 
setting the stage for open and fruitful discussions 
congressional leaders speaking with reporters outside the white 
house after the meeting generally steered away from questions 
about tax increases 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash said i think there is 
an understanding wed like to avoid the automatic spending cuts 
that would be triggered in the absence of a budget agreement 
no decisions have been made other than to begin discussions 
next week said senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
and house minority leader bob michel rill said that there 
were limits to what negotiators can do faced with the need to make 
up to 100 billion in cuts 
budget slashes of such magnitude run the risk of being 
injurious to the economy michel said 
foley said he has appointed rep richard gephardt of missouri 
the democratic majority leader and an outspoken critic of the 
administration to chair his delegation to the talks the speakers 
other negotiators are rep william h gray iii dpa the 
majority whip and reps dan rostenkowski of illinois jamie 
whitten of mississippi and leon panetta of california the 
democratic chairmen of the ways and means appropriations and 
budget committees respectively 
michel said the house republicans would be reps newt gingrich 
of georgia and the ranking republicans on those same three 
taxwriting and finance committees reps bill archer of texas 
silvio o conte of massachusetts and bill frenzel of minnesota 
mitchell said sen wyche fowler dga would be his personal 
representative to the talks along with sens robert byrd 
dwva lloyd bentsen dtexas and james sasser dtenn the 
chairmen of appropriations finance and budget respectively 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan was expected to name 
his representatives later today 
budget director richard darman told congress on tuesday that 50 
billion to 100 billion might be needed in deficitfighting steps 
this year between two and three times more than the savings bush 
said would be needed when he submitted his budget last january 
fitzwater said bush would not participate directly in the 
meetings but would monitor them closely and will be involved as 
necessary he said the threeway negotiations will be conducted 
by teams from the house senate and white house 
earlier michel urged gop lawmakers to hold their fire and 
stop criticizing the budget efforts by the white house and 
congressional leaders 
nobody wants to make a tough choice michel said after 
meeting with house republicans this morning 
fitzwater said that from the presidents vantage point the 
special budget negotiations have four basic objectives 
reducing the deficit substantially on a multiyear basis 
allowing the economy to grow at a continued strong pace 
overhaul the congressional budget process 
to avoid the adverse economic and programmatic effects of a 
stalemate that might otherwise ensue 
fitzwater said there was no specific timetable for forging an 
agreement but he added all parties feel that its in the best 
interests to try to move this process forward immediately 
although until recently fitzwater and other administration 
officials have issued optimistic assessments of the economy 
fitzwater declared that economic growth is low at this point 
and the nations economy is weakening 
there is no hiding from that fitzwater said we do have 
an economic problem that we need to deal with 
some republicans have vowed to oppose any tax increases that 
might emerge from the talks 
michel asked what he told gop colleagues after meeting with 
them this morning replied hold their fire keep their powder 
dry dont be quick to criticize when theyre not a party to 
whatever is being negotiated 
on tuesday iowa gov terry branstad a republican who heads the 
national governors association warned bush to expect an uprising 
from the states over proposals for a national sales tax states 
are going to dig in very strongly against a national sales tax 
branstad said i think that would be a big mistake

an advocacy group recommended wednesday that 
person who stay home to care for children or disabled family 
members be given social security credit 
the older womens league said current law penalizes women who 
are more likely than men to leave the work force for family duties 
that give them no credit in the social security system 
the group released a report that executive director joan 
kuriansky said shows in brutal detail what is in store for 
americas midlife and younger women 
the report said that federal pension policies mean unmarried and 
widowed women who retire 30 years from now are much more likely to 
live in poverty than either married women or men 
at fault the report said are social security and private 
pension systems that favor the traditional family and so 
benefit men owl said fewer than 10 percent of american families 
fit the traditional profile of a working father homemaker mother 
and two children 
there are systemwide inequities that will continue to 
penalize women owl president lou glasse said at a news 
conference where release of the report was timed to precede 
mothers day this sunday 
pension eligibility has generally required longterm 
continuous fulltime service with one employer a bad fit for 
women she said 
glasse said congress should at least allow debate on the idea of 
social security credit for nonworking caregivers 
policy makers should realize that women do move in and out of 
the workforce kuriansky said 
owl also called on congress to 
mandate portable pension plans so that people who change jobs 
may take with them all retirement contributions 
reduce from five the maximum number of years employers may 
require for vesting 
owl claimed that for most women decades of social security 
contributions will translate into virtually the same retirement 
benefits as those paid to their mothers who may never have earned 
wages or paid social security taxes 
the league said that 20 years into the next century social 
security and private pension plans will have practically ended 
poverty among older men and couples but financial problems will 
remain widespread for single women 
glasse said women 30 years away from retirement are already in 
jeopardy 
the report said the 55yearold social security system and 
private pension plans penalize women who typically live longer 
than men but earn less money the owl said 70 percent of baby boom 
women will outlive their husbands by about 15 years but on 
average will earn about twothirds the pay for men their age 
if our nations social security and pension programs remain 
fundamentally unchanged the retirement income future is unlikely 
to get any brighter for women the league said

it is 2 oclock on a thursday somewhere in the 
lush and leafy suburbs a bell rings a woman opens a book and 
reads aloud the treasured words of herman melvilles moby dick 
while 21 women listen in rapture 
welcome to the thursday club where great books have been read 
aloud every week for 100 years and while most of its members are 
elderly the club and others like it are thriving 
no one knows how many americans belong to such clubs which can 
trace their origins to before the civil war when housewives found a 
way to awaken sleeping intellects but according to bowdoin college 
professor theodora penny martin the impulse persists 
ms martin gets a glimpse of this whenever she gives a talk 
about her 1987 book on the early days of womens reading clubs 
the sound of our own voices 
women of middle age and even younger the minute they hear 
about the clubs want to tell me about a book club they are in 
ms martin said in a telephone interview from brunswick maine 
there still is that sense of wanting to be intellectually 
alive outside their jobs and also a sense of wanting to be part of 
a circle of women she said 
the thursday club with two members in their 90s and most in 
their 60s and 70s is still the exclusive invitationonly group it 
was in 1890 
members still take turns being hostesses of readings every 
thursday from 2 pm to 4 pm october to may the routine 
strictly kept is one hour of reading from a book of lasting value 
such as works by james joyce charles dickens homer goethe and 
confucius they also read more contemporary writers such as james 
baldwin gabriel garcia marquez alice walker and thomas mann 
a brief break follows with water the sole refreshment then 
comes an hour of lighter fare such as poetry or plays 
i feel as though i am witnessing the last members of a very 
special generation raised by victorian grandmothers i dont 
think there are women who are like this anywhere its a rarefied 
little group said deborah youngman 
at 39 ms youngman is the baby as one member described the 
doctoral candidate in human development 
i imagined it would be the quintessential bluestocking affair 
it was not i also assumed it would be a marvelous opportunity to 
observe local high quaint said the native californian now living 
in belmont 
i couldnt have been more naive they are rather more than 
middleaged rather more than middleclass white clad in good old 
wool and sensible shoes theyre very very serious 
they are rich and evocative but not in cakes and tea ms 
youngman said 
such reading clubs began in the midwest in 1860 and reached 
their heyday around 1900 when membership was estimated at nearly 1 
million typically comprising welloff housewives with children in 
school and servants at home 
for a long time the literary gatherings provided women unable 
to attend college a place to use their minds but early in this 
century women were finally getting into many schools and reading 
clubs began to fall by the way 
the clubs also felt the drain and distraction of women during 
the two world wars further decimation occurred after the 1960s as 
the women who might have joined reading clubs poured into 
universities and out again into professions 
groups like the thursday club may one day vanish ms youngman 
said she fears that one day she will be its last member and the one 
to take its archives to their final rest at the belmont public 
library 
she should talk to alfreda l irwin 
mrs irwin 77 an author and journalist is now in chautauqua 
ny but she still belongs to the wednesday club she joined as a 
housewife in 1938 in franklin pa 
i go back and its just marvelous because they have all these 
wonderful educated women who are just very anxious to participate 
in this interesting club she said in a telephone interview

a fire destroyed at least 60 homes and 
blackened about 16 square miles in michigans parched lower 
peninsula before being brought under control and firefighters 
welcomed midmorning rain 
three smaller fires covering a total of about one square mile 
destroyed at least 20 homes in rural northern roscommon and 
southern crawford counties officials said 
the larger fire broke out in a forested area in eastern crawford 
county tuesday afternoon forcing the evacuation of about 300 
people grayling sheriffs officials said 
one resident along the au sable river norbert szkotnicki said 
he snuck past police barricades tuesday evening to check on his 
home he found part of it burning 
i got a chainsaw and cut off a burning corner of the 
cabin he said firefighters then arrived and doused the house 
saving it 
my family has been here 110 years my grandfather built that 
house he said i wasnt going to lose it 
another resident william witt piled three elderly neighbors 
and their five dogs into his car and fled as the fire reached his 
driveway 
when i saw the fire come through i didnt worry about nothing 
but dogs and people he said today 
the blaze was brought under control late tuesday fire officials 
worried about forecast winds of 1020 mph today but light rain 
started falling at midmorning as four national guard helicopters 
dumped 185gallon drums of water on areas that continued burning 
thank god for the rain crawford county sheriffs deputy 
heide miller said 
deputy sheriff mike shearer said today that about 100 structures 
had burned including at least 60 homes 
one firefighter was hospitalized for smoke inhalation 
all you see are burned spots on the ground that used to be 
homes said firefighter jed blaauw 
there will be a lot of broken hearts said bill mahalak 
acting regional forest manager for the department of natural 
resources as he drove past the burned homes along the au sable 
river known for its trout fishing 
about 150 firefighters battled the blaze officials said 
a 14squaremile area was evacuated tuesday as gusts of more 
than 20 mph pushed the fire at nearly 4 mph said forest manager 
jim mcmillan 
but an unexpected change in the weather caused winds to shift 
blowing the fire back onto itself firefighter scott heather said 
that and a brief rain gave firefighters enough of a break to plow 
fire lines officials said 
weve had about a dozen saves dean goss said late tuesday 
as he looked at the only house still standing in one section of 
wood along the river 
around him the flames on one house crackled and another behind 
it smoldered in the dark a stone chimney the only thing left 
standing 
officials said the spring fire season is at its worst as warm 
winds dried out last years leaves before this years growth had a 
chance to get started 
much of the northern lower peninsula is 1 to 2 inches behind in 
rainfall this spring said state fire specialist art sutton

the letters michael behnke gets brim 
with such gratitude they can be heartbreaking 
i just had to write and thank you for making my day week and 
year wrote one correspondent from westlake ohio 
this letter changed me it made me realize what i do is 
terribly important wrote another from troy mich 
usedcar salesmen in need of a hug wornout parents feeling 
neglected by their children 
no these letters came from high school teachers they were 
replying to an annual form letter from behnke admissions director 
at the massachusetts institute of technology 
if teaching teenagers is a thankless task mit doesnt think it 
should be several years ago behnke initiated the custom of 
dispatching letters of praise to the educators who loomed large in 
the lives of students newly admitted to the school as 
undergraduates 
the form letter goes like this 
each year we ask students admitted to mit to share with us 
the name of a teacher who has been especially influential in that 
students development 
we congratulate you on being named this year by and the 
students name is filled in more importantly we thank you for 
the time patience expertise love discipline and all the other 
qualities which have had such an important impact on your students 
you do the work from which we all benefit 
congratulations again on the respect you have earned from your 
students 
among the 1800 questionnaires returned from incoming freshman 
admitted for fall 1989 1265 teachers were cited behnke said 
every year about 20 teachers thank him in turn for the letters 
he feels he has tapped a deep need for recognition among 
purveyors of the three rs 
the mit letter even reached that citadel of public expression 
dear abby one teacher ecstatic about getting a thank you letter 
from mit sent a copy to the columnist and signed off my name is 
legion my address is cloud nine 
behnke said he finds the teachers responses moving and a bit 
disturbing 
you are both happy and sad that not more is done that so 
little can mean so much it is troublesome 
not that the subject doesnt have its lighter side 
one new york educator with a sense of humor and a smart son 
wrote along with his thank you this year that he had been cited 
four times by former students so he said behnke recalled i 
hope you pay attention when i write a letter of recommendation for 
my own son 
the son was admitted 
the idea of giving due credit occurred to behnke when he arrived 
at mit five years ago the school was already collecting names of 
teachers from incoming students but mit was only using the names 
as contacts when recruiters went around the country seeking 
topnotch young minds 
behnke 46 a former high school teacher and the husband of one 
decided to lift those teachers names out of the anonymity of the 
databank 
i know how much teachers appreciate hearing from students 
he said noting that high school teachers have the hardest time of 
any getting audience feedback 
its hard for adolescents behnke said if they show too 
much excitement theyre accused of brownnosing its not cool 
but youngsters take their cues from adults he said in 
society people get accustomed to not thanking people in general 
this is a very small gesture

for senate appealed to his nearest rival wednesday to forgo a 
runoff in the spirit of party unity against archconservative 
republican sen jesse helms 
in ohio the man who ousted scandaltainted rep donald buz 
lukens said his campaign was a mission to do whats right for the 
district 
in other results of tuesdays primaries west virginia democrats 
nominated sen jay rockefeller for a second term but dashed former 
first lady dee capertons hopes of becoming state treasurer 
rockefeller will face republican john yoder in november 
ohio democrats pinned their gubernatorial hopes on attorney 
general anthony j celebrezze jr setting up a november contest 
with former cleveland mayor george voinovich voters in ohios 
cuyahoga county approved a higher sin tax on liquor and 
cigarettes to finance a new 344 million downtown sports complex

atlantic city nj mayor james l usry came in second in a 
sevenway race and will compete in a june 12 runoff against 
councilman jim whelan 
gantt the black former mayor of charlotte who was running in a 
sixman field fell short of the 40 percent mark that would have 
guaranteed him the nomination under state law the secondplace 
finisher can order a june 5 runoff and michael easley the 
brunswick county district attorney did just that 
we dont want to send our candidate into the fall armed with 
less than 40 percent of the vote easley told reporters there 
appears to be no real consensus it appears the voters ought to 
hear more from mike easely and harvey gantt 
but gantt urged easley to reconsider 
before mike easley takes that walk to the board of elections 
he should consider unity over divisiveness gantt said we 
should not divert attention from the real challenge of defeating 
jesse helms 
thad beyle a political science professor at the university of 
north carolina at chapel hill said a runoff would be bad news for 
gantt 
i think if you go on the basis of the political history of the 
state if a liberal or a minority doesnt win it in the first 
primary theyll lose it in the second primary beyle said 
with 99 percent of precincts reporting gantt led with 258501

washington on wednesday saying he planned to return to a normal 
life 
state rep john boehner who won the primary denied lukens was 
the issue 
this race was never focused on lukens boehner told 
supporters when i started last june it was a mission to do what

boehner will face the democratic nominee gregory jolivette

pope john paul ii stepped off a raised 
fencedoff platform and plunged into a jammed prison yard today in 
an unscheduled display of compassion as a convict chorus sang 
beethovens ode to joy 
the pontiff then told about a thousand prisoners that the 
worst prison is a closed heart and urged them to keep up their 
hope for a better life because christ never loses hope in his 
creatures 
the pope had been scheduled to greet only one prisoner a man 
who had killed his wife before his brief speech but john paul 
conferred with several assistants when he reached a platform that 
had been set up in the prison yard 
the prisoners were confined behind a high cyclone fence but the 
pope descended from the platform ordered that a gate be opened 
and strolled into the yard greeting and blessing prisoners for 20 
minutes 
one prisoner showed off an injured foot and others appeared to 
be shaking with nervousness or joy as the pope approached a prison 
band played mexican tunes then broke into the ode to joy in 
spanish as the pope toured the yard the ode is the choral 
finale to beethovens ninth symphony 
the state prison in durango holds about 1200 prisoners 
authorities said including convicted murderers and drug 
traffickers 
the pontiff was scheduled to address a crowd of businessmen on 
their social responsibility during the afternoon 
on tuesday night in a speech to diplomats in mexico city 450 
miles to the southeast the pope called for a moral as well as an 
economic approach to the imprisoning foreign debt crisis 
technical measures are not enough to resolve the great 
problems that menace international equilibrium the pope told the 
diplomats 
i feel the obligation to underline the ethical dimension 
of this imprisoning crisis which the pontiff said was 
hindering development in many poor nations of the world 
john paul met the diplomats after celebrating a mass for young 
people near a shrine at san juan de los lagos 250 miles northwest 
of mexico city 
there he encouraged mexicos young people not to be 
disheartened by injustice and inequality and to use christ as a 
defense against despair 
he said loss of hope in todays world was symbolized by 
evasion abandon hedonism discotheques drugs indifference 
pessimism the artificial paradises in which so many find refuge 
young people dont lose hope you are the pilgrims of hope 
the pontiff cried 
more than 200000 people packed the slopes of a hill outside san 
juan for the mass on tuesday many waved flags in papal white and 
yellow or in green the towns colors and interrupted the pope 
frequently with cheers and chants priests wore white robes and 
yellow baseball caps to ward off the harsh sun 
the town was one of the centers of a guerrilla war waged in the 
1920s by catholic conservatives opposed to the governments tight 
religious restrictions and memories of the conflict are still 
strong a large banner on a building facing the altar read viva 
cristo rey long live christ the king the battle cry of the 
cristero rebels 
in a morning address to teachers the pope issued a veiled call 
for a lifting of constitutional prohibitions on religious schools 
a prohibition that is ignored by many schools and even universities 
open the world of teaching to christ the pope said in a 
speech at the airport in aguascalientes about 50 miles north of 
san juan de los lagos 
churchstate relations are now at their best in 50 years and 
president carlos salinas de gortari recently sent a personal 
representative to the pope the move was seen as a step toward 
possible reestablishment of the diplomatic ties severed in 1926 
i have observed with great satisfaction the significant and 
important gesture of the president the pope told the diplomats 
on tuesday evening 
john pauls eightday trip is his 47th outside italy since 
becoming pope he first visited mexico in 1979

rival christian forces escalated their 
battle wednesday for control of a strategic stretch of coastline 
killing 20 people and wounding 41 in fierce shelling duels police 
said 
the barrages came after rebel gen michel aoun threatened to 
attack ships using ports controlled by his rival samir geageas 
lebanese forces militia 
aoun backed up his threat by using howitzer batteries deployed 
in mountains northeast of beirut to shell almost the entire length 
of the christian enclaves 28mile mediterranean coastline in an 
effort to block geageas supply lines a police spokesman said 
police said aouns gunners were shelling ports controlled by the 
lebanese forces at jounieh amsheet byblos and beirut harbor 
geageas fighters responded by firing salvoes from 
multibarrelled rocket launchers at territory controlled by aouns 
19000man army including a threemile coastal strip around dbaye 
where the rebel general has a makeshift port 
its the war of ports they are shelling each others sea 
outlets said the spokesman who cannot be named in line with 
regulations 
the whole christian enclave is on fire it is a war of 
destruction no ground offensives are underway 
police said the casualties included a family of three who were 
killed when a 122mm rocket blasted their singlestory house in the 
aounheld mountain resort of baskinta northeast of beirut 
casualties from the latest round of fighting raised the overall 
toll to 972 killed and 2564 wounded since geagea and aoun began 
their battle for control of the 310squaremile christian enclave 
on jan 30 
the coastal battle has intensified since april 23 when geagea 
ordered his flotilla of 20 speedboats and one gunboat to blockade 
aouns sea outlet at dbaye to prevent the rebel forces from 
receiving weapons and ammunition 
aoun who has only two crippled gunboats trapped at dbaye has 
relied on his howitzer batteries to shell his rivals ports 
jounieh 12 miles north of beirut is the terminal for a ferry 
and hydrofoil from cyprus these vessels are the christians only 
outlet from their enclave which is ringed on its land sides by 
syrian troops and their moslem militia allies 
aouns headquarters issued a communique early wednesday warning 
local and international maritime agencies against serving any port 
along the coast of the christian enclave 
the communique said aoun had declared the christian coast a 
military operations zone 
sailing across it is banned to any vessel irrespective of its 
type or cargo it said 
geagea in a defiant response told the christian voice of 
lebanon radio that aoun will not be able to squeeze us even if he 
maintains his shelling for 10 years 
smoke billowed from east beiruts ashrafiyeh district a geagea 
stronghold and the pinewoods of the metn mountains northeast of 
beirut where aouns troops are entrenched 
the thuds of exploding shells echoed across beirut as radio 
stations interrupted regular programming to blare appeals from 
hospitals for blood donations to cope with the influx of casualties 
beiruts moslem sector has not been involved in the christian 
fighting about 400000 of the christian enclaves 1 million 
population have fled the fighting mainly to safer areas in 
predominantly moslem sectors of the nation 
in another development lebanese president elias hrawi and prime 
minister salim hoss drove to the syrian capital of damascus for 
talks with president hafez assad on ways of implementing a peace 
plan to end lebanons 15yearold civil war 
aoun has rejected the arab leaguebrokered peace accord 
endorsed by lebanons parliament in the saudi arabian resort of 
taif in october because it does not guarantee the withdrawal of 
the 40000 syrian troops in lebanon 
he also refuses to recognize hrawis election to implement the 
peace plan 
geagea has recognized hrawi and cautiously accepted the peace 
plan which calls for an equal distribution of power between 
moslems and christians

a prisoner assigned to pick up litter 
along a state highway has lived up to the name trustee 
hampton county jail spokesman richard mccarthy said tuesday that 
when the inmate discovered a bag discarded along the road 
containing more than 1100 in cash and checks he gave it to a 
corrections officer 
the money and checks had been stolen in a jan 12 breakin from 
the office for the aging in nearby westfield 
we never expected to see any of the money again said sophia 
bousquet executive director that young man should be commended 
for his honesty 
she said no one has been arrested for the breakin but we 
recovered all but one of the checks that were taken and 470 of the 
750 in cash and needless to say we are very happy 
mccarthy said state confidentiality laws prevented him from 
releasing the name of the inmate or the nature of his offense 
without the mans permission he said the prisoner had been one of 
a group of six trustees working to clean up roadways under the 
guard of a corrections officer may 3

in a prelude to the massive unemployment 
expected during the unification of the germanys the number of 
jobless east germans nearly doubled last month compared with march 
officials said wednesday 
economic experts in both countries say the union of their 
countries economies will put tens of thousands of east germans out 
of work because dozens of dated and inefficient east german 
companies will fold 
the west german mark will replace the nearly valueless east 
german mark on july 2 increasing pressure on east german 
businesses unable to pay off massive debts in the hard currency 
also wednesday the 20 unions belonging to the east german labor 
federation freie deutsche gewerkschaftsbund voted to disband the 
organization and form a new one 
for four decades the federation was the communistrun labor 
organization 
despite attempts to break away from government control it has 
been criticized for failing to adapt to change following the fall 
of the hardline communist government last year and plans for 
unification and a free market economy 
the prospect of massive unemployment at the outset of 
unification was one of the major issues in east germanys march 18 
elections the first free balloting in the nations history 
workers protested what they accurately predicted would be 
widespread layoffs from onceguaranteed jobs 
the ministry for labor and social affairs said wednesday the 
number of unemployed rose from 38313 in march to 64948 last month 
they included 36000 skilled workers and 16000 unskilled 
workers according to the figures distributed by the 
governmentrun news agency adn 
adn did not provide a figure for april unemployment as a 
percentage of the total labor force east germany only recently 
began releasing unemployment data and its current figures are 
considered incomplete 
officials said the number of job openings had slumped 
considerably to 73558 in april but did not provide figures for 
comparison 
east germany once had one of the strongest economies in the 
soviet bloc but it has been plagued by inefficiency since the 
beginning of the 1980s 
western experts say cumbersome central planning made east german 
businesses slow to adapt to changes and trends the same held true 
for other countries in eastern europe that are now moving toward 
market economies following the democratic reforms that have swept 
the region 
east germanys economy suffered another serious blow in 
september when tens of thousands of skilled workers began fleeing 
the country for west germany even after the east germans were 
allowed full freedom of travel last november workers continued 
leaving in droves to west germany 
in all more than 500000 east germans left the country from 
january 1989 through march of this year 
west german officials and business leaders are counting on 
massive investment from the west to rebuild the east german economy

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers 
throughout the country 
may 5 
grants pass ore daily courier on the hostage situation 
iranian president hashemi rafsanjani is miffed that the united 
states isnt falling over itself trying to thank him for helping 
with the release of two american hostages in the past two weeks 
the releases though are a little like a man agreeing to quit 
beating two of his neighbors 19 children hes still whipping the 
remainder 
in this case rafsanjani and the terrorists in beirut supported 
by his government are inflicting the damage while western 
countries wait for the release of 17 more hostages 
why should the united states or any of these other countries 
make a goodwill gesture to terrorists who have robbed innocent 
people of years of their lives and continue to hold them for no 
apparent reason 
rewarding countries or terrorists for the release of the 
hostages would be like paying ransom which would only encourage 
the seizing of more westerners 
at first the captors members of islamic jihad or islamic 
holy war wanted to trade their hostages for 17 comrades 
imprisoned in kuwait for bombing the us and french embassies 
there 
that deal was rejected by former president reagan long ago 
though 
since then the kidnappers have turned the hostages into 
representatives of their governments protesting the presence and 
policies of the united states and the other western countries by 
continuing to hold and threaten their captives 
but during the last five years the united states has reduced to 
low levels its armed forces in the middle east and put pressure on 
israel to begin talks with the palestinians on a solution in the 
occupied territories 
whats more us officials have repeatedly stated they wont 
deal with the kidnappers 
these conditions have made the hostages more of a liability than 
an asset for the kidnappers and those associated with them

concord nh monitor on the hostage situation 
as freed hostage frank reed said this weekend the taking of 
hostages is a tactic as old as civilization captives can be traded 
for arms exchanged for prisoners or held by the enemy as insurance 
against attack 
but even in the united states where reverence for the value of 
the individual life is perhaps greater than anywhere else in the 
world the lives of hostages have never been more important than 
geopolitics 
so as much as americans may rejoice in the release of reed and 
robert polhill the president cannot rush to reward the hostage 
takers and those who influenced them i want to see all hostages 
released bush said last week what he meant was that israel 
should free some of the hostages it has taken including sheik 
obeid but he could not afford to come out and say so

the heralddispatch huntington wva on defense spending 
reality is beginning to soak in at the pentagon if defense 
secretary dick cheneys proposals for cutting advanced aircraft 
spending is any indication 
still it wouldnt be very difficult for someone such as say 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee to find far deeper cuts that could be made in the 
defense budget 
though cheney has proposed cuts of about 35 billion between 
1991 and 1997 that amounts to less than 2 percent of the original 
figure about 2 trillion that the armchair generals and 
admirals at the pentagon had anticipated spending during that 
period 
congress could and should demand far larger cuts 
the cold war is over the berlin wall is no more eastern europe 
has rejected communism the warsaw pact is falling apart and the 
soviet union itself is undergoing unprecedented internal turmoil 
yet the soviet union remains a nuclear superpower and yes 
the united states must continue to maintain a strong defense 
keeping our guard up against any eventuality nonetheless the 
current course of events should make it clear that this country can 
make far deeper spending cuts at the pentagon than cheney proposes 
every unnecessary defense dollar that is cut can add to 
americas economic strength and as the 1990s unfold that strength 
will perhaps mean far more to our national security than more 
tanks bombers and nuclear missiles

the odessa texas american on the united states and the soviet 
union 
president bush has been praised for his caution but his actions 
make us wonder why 
his administration announced an agreement to grant the soviet 
union most favored nation status probably to be signed at the 
summit between bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
this follows bushs recent refusals to even murmur a single word 
of protest against the soviet strangulation of lithuania 
removing trade restriction between the free individuals of two 
nations is always to be praised free trade would advance the 
freedom movement within the soviet union 
but granting most favored nation status also entails granting 
the soviet loan credits backed by us taxpayers 
and bushs timing even as famished lithuanians see their food 
and fuel supplies choked off suggests an act of unprincipled 
groveling 
couldnt he have waited or recognized lithuanias independence 
as a countermove would the summit have been endangered 
perhaps but americas real strength in the world is not so much 
its ability to negotiate deals with other powers but rather its 
adherence to principles of freedom and decency which beg for 
recognition of the lithuanian peoples courage 
for now the more bush trusts gorbachev the less americans will 
trust bush

the pressenterprise riverside county calif on the sampl 
bailout 
the sampl bailout will cost more than the bailouts of lockheed 
chrysler penn central and new york city combined by conservative 
estimate 
chairman william seidman of the resolution trust corp an 
agency created last august to merge and sell insolvent sampls and 
their assets has displeased president bush with his candid 
appraisals that the cost of all this was rising rapidly the 
president originally estimated the cost of the project at 166 
billion over 10 years the fact that independent assessments 
support seidman doesnt seem to matter the gao figures it 
could run up to 500 billion over 30 years george bush wants 
seidman out 
seidman has tenure he is in this job as an extension of his 
first title head of the federal deposit insurance corp an 
independent agency because the senate confirmed him the president 
cant fire him he doesnt have to leave until his term is up in 
october 1991 
if the truth about this bailout nettles george bush well too 
bad keeping top people on the job is the percentage play here and 
even a few percent of 500 billion makes it worthwhile

the providence ri journalbulletin on going metric 
by 1993 the european community is scheduled to have a unified 
economy larger than that of the united states with all product 
standards based on the metric system but some us exporters may 
miss out on this vast market if they dont begin to adapt their 
products to metric the measurement system used by most of the 
world 
government agencies as well as companies have been slow to 
adapt to a world of tens the comptroller generals office cites a 
study showing there has been little preparation for complying with 
a law that agencies use the metric system as much as possible by 
october 1991 the commerce department which should be leading the 
way because of its foreigntrade responsibilities was particularly 
faulted for not giving more leadership 
it may be a great inconvenience for a while but going metric is 
one of those chores we will have to perform to compete in the 
international marketplace and the sooner the better people may 
still usefully employ the historic english system in their private 
lives but companies and government agencies should get to work on 
the transition

the starledger newark nj on the deficit 
reading president bushs lips today is likely to bring forth a 
different message than in the past when he was adamantly against 
new taxes the president has given assurance that the budget talks 
under way with congress will be unfettered and will have no 
preconditions even new taxes once a taboo subject will be on 
the agenda 
congressional leaders make similar optimistic murmurs but no 
official is predicting that the talks will really make a difference 
in reducing the nations enormous deficit and such caution is 
more than warranted 
there has been little or no progress in reducing the deficit 
since the huge shortfall that followed passage of the delusive 
kemproth tax cut legislation in 1981 
there are several reasons for this failure to act by our elected 
officials other than sheer irresponsibility for one thing we have 
been spared the consequences of our huge deficit because foreigners 
have been willing to borrow such large amounts in our credit 
markets 
the other is that there has been no political retribution 
wreaked by the electorate on our spendthrifts 
and so once again the responsibility remains on the president 
and congress to agree on a plan that makes real deficit cuts fine 
words wont do it there have to be real reductions in spending 
and in all probability tax increases as well

the daily telegraph london on a united germany 
the goal of the series of talks which started in bonn over the 
weekend must be not only the transfer of the wartime victors 
residual powers to a united germany but also the opening of the way 
to that common european home of which the russians so often 
speak 
the removal of landbased nuclear missiles from europe further 
cuts in conventional weapons the strengthening of natos political 
functions a higher profile for the 35nation conference on 
security and cooperation in europe a sympathetic response to the 
soveit unions wish for integration into the world economy all 
these are means of drawing moscow out of its isolation on the 
eastern periphery of the continent 
the division of germany into two hostile states was at the core 
of postwar divisions transcending it should move europe to the

the recording industry on wednesday unveiled a 
uniform warning label for albums with explicit lyrics and expressed 
hope that an improved voluntary system will halt campaigns in some 
states for mandatory labeling 
the blackandwhite stickers reading parental advisory 
explicit lyrics will appear on the lower righthand corner of 
the front of albums that might be objectionable because of lyrics 
dealing with sex violence suicide drug abuse bigotry or satanic 
worship 
the decision of whether to affix the labels will be left up to 
the record companies and their individual artists said jay berman 
president of the recording industry association of america whose 
members produce more than 90 percent of the records sold in the 
united states 
berman said the warning labels will begin appearing on the outer 
packaging under the cellophane wrap of potentially offensive 
records cassettes and compact discs reaching retail music stores 
in july 
the label size will range from 1 inches by 1 inch for albums 
and cd long boxes to 1 inch by a halfinch for cassettes and cd 
cases 
we believe the uniform logo will enhance the existing 
voluntary system and better respond to the legitimate concerns ofserve 
in that post a us 
official said wednesday

the number of deer to be hunted in northern 
wisconsin each year should be equally divided between the chippewa 
tribe and nonindians a federal judge ruled wednesday 
us district judge barbara crabb said equal division between 
the states six chippewa bands and nonindian hunters should assure 
enough deer for both parties 
crabbs ruling came in a lawsuit filed by the chippewa her 
decision to limit tribal deer hunting to 50 percent of the 
available resource contrasts sharply with her earlier ruling that 
the chippewa should be entitled to 100 percent of the safe 
allowable catch of fish in northern wisconsin 
crabb refused to discuss why her deer decision differed from the 
one on fish catch 
wisconsins six chippewa bands retain the right to spearfish 
hunt and cut timber offreservation on public lands in northern 
wisconsin under 19thcentury federal treaties 
since a court affirmed those rights in 1983 the chippewa have 
exercised their spearfishing rights on northern lakes encountering 
huge and sometimes violent protests by outdoorsmen 
the opponents argue that the special treaty rights are unfair 
because they are denied to nonindians 
since the court ruling affirming the rights the chippewa bands 
have filed a series of lawsuits asking the court to define how much 
of the resources of northern wisconsin they are entitled to under 
the treaties and to what degree the state can regulate tribal 
activities 
crabb previously ruled the indians are entitled to 100 percent 
of the safe harvest of walleye on northern lakes during 
spearfishing safe refers to the number of fish biologists say can 
be taken without harming fish populations she has yet to rule on 
how much timber the tribe should be allowed to cut

andy rooneys suspension from 60 minutes 
caused him to be more careful but he says the entire episode was 
a better example of timidity than it was a violation of my first 
amendment rights 
broadcasters are hardly the only people to blame of course 
the timidity with which the broadcast industry approaches seriously 
controversial ideas is reflected by society or perhaps the 
broadcast industrys timidity is a reflection of our society the 
cbs commentator said 
in february cbs news president david burke suspended rooney for 
three months after an article published by the los angelesbased 
gay lifestyle magazine advocate attributed racist and homophobic 
quotes to rooney 
burke eventually shortened rooneys suspension to three weeks 
burke decided between my right to say something and his 
obligation to keep the peace between cbs and several minorities 
hed better get rid of me rooney said monday in a speech to 
1000 people gathered at a constitutional rights foundation dinner 
its my personal opinion that my suspension was a better 
example of timidity than it was a violation of my first amendment 
rights he said 
rooney said we have become a nation that doesnt say what it 
thinks about so many things and he faulted special interest 
groups for squelching debate on television and in politics 
there are organized minorities for almost every cause and 
politicians along with network executives are scared to death of 
them he said selfinterest is what draws people to the voting 
booth 
most people have the feeling that what happens in an election 
wont matter much to them so they dont vote its the people with 
some personal cause not those with a general belief in democracy

hate crime victims some speaking through sobs 
and some with unvarnished anger described at a hearing wednesday 
the murders stabbings beatings and firebombings that have ravaged 
their lives 
my brother jimmy was a kind loving caring person said 
peggy marlow but because james zappalorti was homosexual she 
said two men stabbed him slit his throat and threw him into the 
water off his staten island home 
they slaughtered him ms marlow said all because he was 
gay 
others told of equally senseless attacks a man who was called a 
faggot and viciously beaten a black man whose home in a mainly 
white neighborhood was firebombed a rabbi whose synagogue was 
daubed with pronazi graffiti 
i dont understand the hatred said a woman whose name was 
withheld she suffered cornea damage when the leader of a gang of 
black youths jabbed her eye with a pin last year 
wilfred phillips said he was so disappointed with the people 
of the neighborhood when saw his firebombed home in february im 
not accusing nobody any one person but i think its a big 
disgrace he said 
the hearing called by city council president andrew stein 
comes at a time of a dispute between black residents and korean 
grocers in brooklyn and jury deliberations are under way in last 
summers slaying of a black youth by a white gang 
the number of hate crimes reported to police has more than 
doubled since 1984 stein said and inspector paul m sanderson 
head of the bias squad said twothirds of the crimes have gone 
unsolved 
they are random isolated and spontaneous making arrests 
difficult sanderson said still he noted that in 2900 cases the 
squad has investigated since 1980 there have been 1300 arrests 
the problem is largely one of youth sanderson said in 70 
percent of the cases the perpetrators are younger than 19 and in 
40 percent they are minors 
the group that attacked bruce ellerin was made up of teenagers 
one called him a faggot he recalled words were exchanged and 
they beat him so badly he suffered a broken cheekbone and a 
detached retina 
what worsened the ordeal ellerin said was the police 
insensitivity and indifference that followed as soon as they 
heard the word faggot they made up their minds that this was not 
the most serious of incidents he said

the budget adviser to congress said wednesday 
the federal gasoline tax may be used for purposes other than 
building highways and bridges 
there is no fundamental economic or governmental reason for 
earmarking tax revenues for specific purposes w david 
montgomery of the congressional budget office told a senate 
transportation subcommittee 
montgomery also said the activities of the highway trust fund 
should not be split off from the rest of the budget 
taking the fund offbudget would make the budget a less 
precise indicator of fiscal policy he said finally the 
existence of the fund and the presence of cash balances can lead to 
pressures for spending that impede deficit reduction and distort 
budget priorities 
the bush administration has also testified through the 
transportation department that the activities of the multibillion 
dollar fund should not be set apart from the rest of the budget 
montgomerys testimony to the senate environment and public 
works subcommittee on water resources transportation and 
infrastructure came in the second day of hearings on the use of the 
governments highway and aviation funds 
a house public works and transportation subcommittee heard 
testimony tuesday 
the two transportation funds are financed through fuel and 
ticket taxes and other user fees the proceeds are supposed to be 
spent on highways bridges and air traffic improvements a small 
share goes to mass transportation 
the funds have accumulated a 25 billion cash balance over the 
years but the real surplus is in dispute because large sums of the 
highway portion are committed to future spending by states 
a custody battle has developed over those funds between the 
states construction industry rural lawmakers and congressional 
public works committees on one side and the tax and 
budgetwriting committees of congress and urban lawmakers on the 
other 
money that goes out of the funds to repair crumbling bridges and 
highways raises the overall deficit unless revenues increase 
correspondingly 
wednesdays hearing was prompted by legislation by sen richard 
bryan dnev that would force the government to release 9 
billion in supposedly unspent trust fund dollars over the next 
three years 
in the house rep bob mcewen rohio has introduced 
legislation that would take the highway fund off budget 
the hearing wednesday came against the backdrop of budget 
discussions between congressional leaders and the white house an 
increased fuel tax advocated by house ways and means chairman dan 
rostenkowski dill could emerge 
currently each 11 gallons of gasoline purchased produces 1 in 
federal tax revenue each 10gallon purchase of diesel fuel other 
than for passenger cars provides 150 
sen john h chafee rri said any increase in the gasoline 
tax should not be earmarked 
i think this committee had better be thinking how those 
revenues will be used said sen daniel p moynihan dny 
subcommittee chairman 
the cbos montgomery said there was another impact of higher 
fuel taxes fighting pollution raising fuel taxes is a way of 
charging users for polluting the air he said

india but few people were evacuated then 
andhra pradeshs chief minister channa reddy said 
telecommunications power and transportation had completely 
broken down in nine coastal towns

coastal area and the state government was relying on ham radio 
operators to convey information army and navy helicopters and 
boats assisted in the rescue and relief operations 
the bulk of the damage was concentrated on a small peninsula 
jutting out into the bay of bengal where the center of the storm 
hit 
six of the dead were killed when a wall collapsed in the east 
godivari district on the peninsula united news said three others 
were electrocuted when wind knocked down live electrical wires

the nations largest teachers union said 
wednesday that the federal government needs to raise education 
spending by 12 billion to fully fund key programs 
in releasing the national education associations annual report 
on federal education expenditures the unions president keith 
geiger said he was tempted to characterize our national 
commitment to education as killing our children with kindness 
we have plenty of kind words for education in our new kinder 
and gentler america but little action to back up these words 
the report tracked the decline in the share of the federal 
budget going to education since 1980 
that year 25 percent of the budget went to education this 
year only 17 percent of federal expenditures will go to 
education the report said 
geiger urged president bush and the congress to rethink the 
budget priorities of the united states and to make education a 
top priority in action as well as in rhetoric 
three specific areas lacking in federal support are handicapped 
bilingual and higher education the report said 
when the handicapped education act was passed in 1975 the 
government promised to provide 40 percent of the excess costs for 
educating disabled students the report said the amount would be 
3520 of the current 8800 for each child yet the federal 
contribution the nea said is 352 
bilingual education programs reach only 56 percent of those 
identified in the 1980s the report said 
as for student aid the nea said 80 percent of highability but 
lowincome high school graduates went on to college in 1980 today 
that figure has dropped below 70 percent part of the reason for 
the drop is that the maximum federal student aid package now pays 
less than 40 percent of college costs compared with as much as 80 
percent of the costs in 1980 
the report also said that head start programs for lowincome 
families will serve about 450000 3 4 and 5yearolds in 
199091 less than 20 percent of the 25 million eligible children 
chapter one reading and math programs for disadvantaged students 
will serve about 53 million children in 199091 half of the 
elementary and secondary students living in poverty

the chairman of a senate foreign relations 
panel said wednesday that nuclear weapons are useless as part of a 
nato strategy because of the collapse of the warsaw pact and 
expected cuts in ussoviet forces 
sen joseph biden ddel told a top defense department 
official that the midsummer review by the 16nation alliance of 
nato strategy should begin with the theory of defending western 
europe with only conventional forces 
i believe the military mission nuclear weapons previously 
served in nato strategy has become obsolete biden said 
there has been a growing belief among nato diplomats that the 
west could safely reduce if not eliminate entirely its arsenal of 
landbased tactical missiles and artillery in europe 
germanys gerhard stoltenberg arriving in canada monday for a 
meeting of nato defense ministers said it was possible that all 
landbased nuclear systems in europe would be withdrawn 
of course the requirement is the readiness of the soviet union 
to withdraw their own systems stoltenberg told reporters 
biden chairman of the foreign relations subcommittee on 
european affairs said he feared that us steps that fail to 
reflect the general feeling in western europe would force the 
united states out 
we must lead in order to remain biden said what im 
planning for is the worstcase scenario because of our actions 
or inactions we lose the support of western europe publics for what 
you and i both believe is sorely needed for our peace security and 
prosperity 
paul wolfowitz undersecretary of defense for policy said the 
bush administration has shown a willingness to change 
president bush announced last week that his administration had 
abandoned plans to build a more powerful shortrange nuclear 
missile and modernize its 155mm nucleartipped artillery shell 
but the president stopped short of proposing elimination of the 
nuclear arsenal saying the united states is not going to allow 
europe to become safe for conventional war 
wolfowitz said the expected withdrawal of soviet forces from 
eastern europe could result in a reduction in the nuclear arsenal 
but our theater nuclear forces will remain critically 
important for deterring all forms of aggression conventional as 
well as nuclear the undersecretary said 
elsewhere on capitol hill two house members issued a draft 
report that contends the united states has focused on the soviet 
threat for 40 years at the expense of preparing for a lowintensity 
conflict or midintensity battle 
the armed forces of the united states are illprepared for the 
realities of conventional combat that are likely to confront them 
over the next 12 years reps dave mccurdy dokla and john 
rowland rconn said in a statement 
the center for strategic and international studies prepared the 
report that urges the defense department to reexamine its current

nato defense ministers wednesday 
opened their first nuclear strategy session since upheavals in 
eastern europe caused the unraveling of the sovietled warsaw pact 
the officials of the north atlantic treaty organization gathered 
for two days of talks in the rugged kananaskis region of the 
canadian rocky mountains site of the 1988 winter olympic games 
the ministers are under pressure to redo their nuclear policy in 
response to greatly reduced eastwest tensions 
west german officials said defense minister gerhard stoltenberg 
intended to press his counterparts to withdraw quickly all of 
natos nuclear artillery shells most of which are deployed in west 
germany 
stoltenberg told reporters earlier this week that it was 
possible for all landbased nuclear systems to be removed from 
europe 
but he linked the withdrawals to a soviet willingness to do the 
same it cannot be unilateral he said it must be on both 
sides 
any push for a quick onesided pullout of nuclear weapons from 
europe would likely be opposed by both the united states and 
britain 
british officials said they do not favor the socalled third 
zero military jargon for the elimination of landbased 
shortrange nuclear missiles in europe 
discussions about scaling back the wests arsenal of battlefield 
nuclear weapons were given fresh impetus last week by president 
bush he announced the cancellation of plans to build a more 
powerful version of the lance shortrange missile and a modernized 
155mm nucleartipped artillery shell 
tactical weapons most deployed in west germany can only hit 
targets in the now friendly countries of eastern europe 
as nato reduces its landbased forces analysts expect it to put 
more emphasis on airlaunched nuclear systems the united states is 
developing a tactical airtosurface missile known as the tasm 
which would replace gravity bombs 
american and british officials though seem intent on avoiding 
any debate on deployment of the new longerrange missile 
there is a certain feeling not to have the meeting dominated 
by tasm said an official who demanded anonymity 
west germany is thought to be reluctant to get into any 
discussions about stationing the tasm missile on aircraft on its 
soil the bonn government holding sensitive negotiations on its 
merger with east germany is mindful of soviet security concerns 
the west contends it needs nuclear weapons to offset the warsaw 
pacts overwhelming superiority in tanks and other conventional 
arms 
the united states and the soviet union are expected to enter 
into negotiations possibly early next year on cutting shortrange 
systems 
a dutch newspaper het parool reported wednesday that the 
united states plans to site 389 new tasm missiles in seven european 
nato nations starting in 1995 if the alliance approves the program 
the plan provides for tasm sites in west germany britain 
italy turkey the netherlands belgium and greece the newspaper 
did not say how it had obtained the information 
at a summit last may bush and other alliance leaders agreed 
that bargaining on the tactical weapons could not occur until 
implementation of an accord reducing tanks artillery troops and 
other conventional arms in europe 
but bush announced last week an acceleration of the timetable 
saying bargaining could start once agreement was reached 
negotiators of nato and the warsaw pact are pressing for a deal by 
fall 
the meeting of the nuclear planning group is one of a series of 
highlevel nato talks this month and next on the alliances future 
and its need for nuclear and conventional forces 
the discussions will wind up with a summer summit of bush and 
other alliance leaders

held twice a year france is a nato member but does not belong to 
the alliances integrated military structure iceland which has no 
armed forces has observer status

members of congress urged the bush 
administration wednesday to drop its opposition to forgiving debts 
owed by poland and other eastern european countries 
the united states and other western nations should write off at 
least a portion of the debt to help the ailing economies of 
countries emerging from four decades of communist rule lawmakers 
said 
reps john lafalce dny and jim leach riowa are 
sponsoring bills that would provide for some type of reduction of 
debt including proposals to exchange the debt for projects in the 
countries that would protect the global environment 
treasury undersecretary david mulford appearing before a 
banking subcommitee chaired by lafalce said the administration was 
unwilling to forgive the 3 billion polish debt in part because of 
the precedent it would set for the 63 billion in foreign debt held 
by the united states 
lafalce told mulford that the dramatic changes in eastern europe 
had to be supported economically by the united states leach warned 
that a certain degree of chaos could result if the united 
states didnt take the lead in fostering the movement to 
freemarket economies 
similar warnings came from polish finance minister leszek 
balcerowicz who called on commercial banks and governments holding 
polands 41 billion in debt to make concessions that would slash 
polands debt payments by 80 percent 
we have to show the polish people that further sacrifices will 
bear fruit he told reporters at a briefing tuesday this is 
why we have been requesting very substantial debt reduction 
mulford said foreign governments already had granted poland a 
moratorium that suspended payments on most of its official debt 
until march 1991 allowing the country to get its new economic 
program under way 
foreign governments hold about 80 percent of polands debt with 
the other 20 percent owed to commercial banks 
the issue is important but how to approach it country by 
country is extremely complicated mulford said of the call for 
debt forgiveness it is just not practical at this moment 
mulford did say the united states had been lobbying commercial 
banks to reach an agreement to reduce polands commercial bank 
debt using the guidelines established last year under treasury 
secretary nicholas bradys debtreduction plan for third world 
countries 
horst schulman managing director of the institute of 
international finance a bank lobbying group said commercial banks 
were looking for official agencies such as the new european bank 
for reconstruction and development to play a greater role in 
supporting eastern europe 
further commercial bank lending at this point will have to 
be based on confidence that the reform process will be successful 
and that countries will again become credit worthy he told the 
subcommittee 
mulford said the new european bank is expected to have an 
american as its no 2 official reflecting the fact that the united 
states will have 10 percent voting power in the organization the 
largest of any single country 
published reports have said that london will be the site for the 
new bank and jacques attali an adviser to french president 
francois mitterrand will head it mulford said those decisions 
will be made at a may 19 meeting 
mulford told members of congress that the united states will 
have a commitment of 12 billion but only 350 million will have 
to be paid into the bank the rest will be available if needed 
mulford said 
the soviet union will be a member of the new bank raising 
questions in congress over whether us tax dollars would go to 
support the soviet economy 
mulford said restrictions written into the banks charter at the 
insistence of the united states will limit the soviet unions 
borrowing authority for the first three years to the amount it 
contributes to the institution

looking for a good deal on a new car 
freddye action jackson is ready to give you a discount on a 
lincoln or mercury as long as you can prove youre christian or 
jewish 
under jacksons christian members buyers plan brown 
lincolnmercury in fairfax city offers cars at a discount to 
practicing christians 
jews qualify jackson said but moslems hindus sikhs and most 
other nonchristians would not 
were a christian dealership we sell the christians cars at 
just a little above invoice said jackson 
under the program jackson sells lincolns for 600 over cost and 
mercurys at 250 over cost to those who qualify jackson said 
pastors can buy lincolns at 400 over what he pays the factory and 
mercurys at 150 over cost 
the dealership also will donate 100 for a lincoln and 50 for a 
mercury to the church of the qualifying customers choice jackson 
said 
realizing that the church is the most vital unit and 
organizaton in society today it is important that we as christians 
continue to work for the lord and support the uplifting of his 
kingdom jackson wrote area churches 
the plan has upset attorney victor glasberg who says the 
discounts may violate the federal equal credit opportunity act 
which forbids religious discrimination in credit transactions 
it is not clear to me that one of the benefits which jesus had 
in mind for those who accepted him as a savior was to provide them 
with discounted lincoln or mercury automobiles glasberg said in 
a letter to the dealership 
state and local officials said jacksons buying program does not 
appear to violate civil rights laws 
the laws apply to housing employment and places of public 
accommodation such as restaurants and movie theaters but not to 
car dealerships said bert rohrer a spokesman for virginia 
attorney general mary sue terry 
jackson compared the program to the united buyers service which 
offers deals to employees of certain companies and united states 
automobile association which is open to military families 
a spokesman for lincolnmercury a division of ford motor co in 
detroit said the company is aware of the program 
ford motor co would not structure a program in this manner 
but freddye jackson is an independent businessman spokesman john 
spelich said quite frankly we dont address this in our sales 
agreements with our dealers 
jackson wont discuss his profits or say how many customers have 
used the program he created shortly after taking over the 
dealership in july 1989 
he says ford pegged the dealership among the lowestranked 
lincolnmercury dealers for customer service in the washington 
area but since he took over and it became a christian 
dealership it has risen to third place 
sales people are not allowed to smoke drink or use profanity in 
the showroom and are encouraged to attend church jackson said 
christ being here made the difference he said

president fernando collor de mello said 
wednesday he wants to fire up to 400000 public employees to speed 
his drastic economic reform program 
were about to complete two months in office in a short 
amount of time weve done a lot but now we need to do more and 
faster collor 40 said during a morning meeting with his 
cabinet ministers 
he also said he wanted to move more quickly on his program to 
privatize state companies and slash federal spending to wipe out a 
31 billion deficit 
collor announced a package of austerity measures on march 16 
his first full day in office as the countrys first freely elected 
president in 29 years they included closing 23 federal companies 
foundations and institutes and an 18month freeze on 115 billion 
in individual and corporate bank accounts 
but collor said wednesday there was still much to be done to 
spur growth in the economy the largest in latin america 
the president who estimated 16 million people work for the 
government or for governmentcontrolled firms ordered his 
ministers to reduce personnel by 20 percent to 25 percent 
the cuts would be made by firings and by placing excess workers 
on what is called in availability a brazilian legal term that 
means that civil servants stay at home and draw only partial 
salaries the premise is that eventually they will become disgusted 
and quit 
but collor did not give a deadline for the layoffs or explain 
how he would skirt a constitutional clause that prevents the firing 
of any federal employee who has been on the job more than five 
years 
he also said public employee salaries should be adequate for 
the reality of the national economy with special attention paid to 
intermediate and upperlevel pay this was interpreted as a sign 
that salaries will be reduced 
in assessing the initial results of his austerity program the 
president said available indicaors show inflation near zero with 
the real value of salaries increased 
before his reforms were put into effect inflation was racing 
along at a rate of 84 percent per month and totaled 4854 percent 
the past 12 months 
collor said the longterm success of the plan depended on 
reducing brazils large state sector 
his critics have complained his measures especially the bank 
freeze had a severe impact on the private sector meanwhile they 
say he has barely acted on his promise to reduce the size of the 
federal government by cutting spending privatizing firms and 
firing public workers 
collors announcement that he intended to fire 320000 to 
400000 government employees was seen partly as a response to the 
critics 
the economic slowdown caused by collors measures has led to the 
firing of an estimated 300000 people in the private sector 
economist julian chacel of the prestigious getulio vargas 
foundation said recently that firing public employees would be 
like lighting a match in a gunpowder depot 
but on wednesday he repeated his promise to privatize many of 
brazils 188 staterun companies many of which lose money and 
together have a debt of 62 billion many also serve as job havens 
for friends and relatives of politicians and appointees 
brazils congress has authorized the privatization of almost all 
state companies with the exception of the oil monopoly petrobras 
the postal service the telecommunication giant embratel and some 
banks 
foreign capital will be allowed to buy 49 percent of capital 
shares in the privatized firms but hold only 33 percent of voting 
shares

the chairman of the house armed services 
committee said wednesday he doubts that the soviet union faced 
with a faltering economy can upgrade its strategic weapons as 
defense secretary dick cheney has predicted 
bad news for the soviet economy is good news for american 
security said rep les aspin dwis as he called for delaying 
the pentagons plans to move full speed ahead in modernizing us 
strategic weapons 
cheney acknowledges the major changes in eastern europe and the 
soviet union but contends that moscow is upgrading its strategic 
forces at a rate that has not been affected by the rapid 
developments overseas 
the pentagon chief responding to budgetary pressures has 
revised the pentagons plans for buying the b2 stealth bomber and 
other sophisticated aircraft cheney has said however that this 
is not the time to abandon us development of strategic weapons 
in a speech to the overseas education fund aspin said cheney is 
the most pessimistic of president bushs advisers on the issue of 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs chances for survival 
aspin noted the public dispute between cheney who believes a 
soviet hard liner opposed to us overtures could succeed 
gorbachev and cia director william webster who has told congress 
that the real threat to the soviet president is from reformers 
the wisconsin democrat said the central intelligence agencys 
report on the soviet economy said its performance in 1989 was 
abysmal soviet economists said the cia was too optimistic 
i listen to what the intelligence services say about the state 
of the soviet economy and dont see how moscow can spend the 
billions of rubles on defense that cheney says they will aspin 
said 
in addition soviet engineers scientists and other technical 
people are in short supply aspin said 
i think it is possible we will see cutbacks in areas such as 
air defenses aircraft carriers and even strategic forces that 
will be significant and add another element of irreversibility to 
the declining soviet threat aspin said

an army colonel who dressed as a 
drag queen to perform at a gay bar has been charged with conduct 
unbecoming an officer three other officers face similar charges 
for homosexual activities 
col edward l modesto 42 a dental surgeon at fort carson was 
accused of engaging in homosexual acts and indecent exposure for 
dressing in a wig and womens clothes and exposing himself to 
customers at a laundromat 
a hearing will be held may 31 to determine if modesto should be 
courtmartialed said fort carson spokesman mike howard 
modesto a selfprofessed bisexual denied the indecency charges 
tuesday 
i think theyre trying to make an example of me and i dont 
know why i know that im an excellent oral surgeon my military 
career is excellent modesto said 
court documents filed last month show that modesto performed as 
carmen at benefit shows at the hide n seek club in colorado 
springs where he dressed in wigs and sequined gowns and 
lipsynched bette midler songs 
but modesto said that he performed as part of a benefit for aids 
patients and that he felt it was not unbecoming behavior 
homosexual acts are prohibited by military regulations and some 
groups are working to get that regulation changed 
we feel that the regulation common to all of the services that 
homosexuality is incompatible with military service is inane and 
without a rational foundation said charles bumer attorney with 
the military law task force of the national lawyers guild 
this is plain oldfashioned homophobia and in our society 
should not be tolerated said task force cochairwoman kathy 
gilberd thousands of lesbians and gays serve honorably in the 
military with considerable bravery 
the modesto investigation began in march after another officer 
was arrested for homosexual activity and identified other 
homosexuals at fort carson including modesto three other soldiers 
have been charged and others are being investigated howard said 
modesto said investigators took the informant to gay bars in 
colorado springs they used him to point out other military 
officers with whom the investigators would strike up a 
conversation he said 
i feel its a type of entrapment to try to engage you in a 
conversation just to find out if you are gay he said i feel 
thats wrong 
i dont think it was done for any other reason except to 
humiliate me he said 
modesto has been removed from patient care but still is working 
at the army hospital howard said 
if convicted of all charges modesto could face 74 years in 
prison fines dishonorable discharge and lose pay and benefits 
after nearly 18 years in the military modesto was just over two 
years from retirement when he was arrested 
theres a big inequity here most of the gay enlisted people 
are being allowed to resign he said he added that all he wants 
now is a discharge because that would allow me to continue my 
profession and go on with my life

in an effort to loosen ties to the east 
bloc hungarys secondlargest political party on wednesday asked 
the government to declare its intention to leave the warsaw pact 
and become a militarily neutral nation 
the league of free democrats in making its proposal to 
parliament cited a 1956 government statement that annulled 
hungarys membership in the sovietled bloc the statement prompted 
a soviet invasion that crushed the rebellion 
deputy parliament speaker matyas szueroes said the proposal 
would be discussed at the lawmaking bodys next session 
until now hungarys leadership has pledged that it would remain 
in the sovietled alliance although individual leaders have 
repeatedly suggested the country could one day become neutral 
the free democrats proposal said hungary should make clear that 
it does not wish to belong to either the warsaw pact or the western 
military alliance nato 
the party which won the secondlargest number of seats in 
parliament in april elections proposed the new declaration on the 
basis of the 1956 statement 
the proposal was presented by miklos vasarhelyi an associate of 
imre nagy the leader of the 1956 uprising vasarhelyi who was 
imprisoned following the uprising helped draft the declaration 
three days after hungary declared its withdrawal from the 
alliance soviet troops and tanks rolled into budapest to crush the 
revolt nagy was executed following a show trial 
kremlin troops have remained in hungary since then now with 
the countrys transition to democracy hungary has negotiated the 
complete withdrawal of soviet troops from her territory by the 
middle of next year 
the new parliament would like to see the accord negotiated by 
the outgoing socialist government renegotiated to speed the 
pullout a special subcommittee of the foreign relations committee 
in parliament is to deal specifically with this issue 
vasarhelyi made clear the proposal does not call for hungarys 
immediate withdrawal from the warsaw pact but opens negotiations on 
the topic with moscow 
he said if the proposal is adopted however hungary should 
suspend all activity in the east bloc alliance and forbid warsaw 
pact exercises on hungarian soil 
the new parliament is no longer dominated by communists or their 
successors the socialists in free balloting in march and april 
the socialist party gained only 33 of the 394 parliamentary seats 
jozsef antall the leader of the centerright hungarian 
democratic forum which has the most seats in parliament is trying 
to form a new government with the likeminded independent 
smallholders and the christian democrats 
antall told parliament he expected to present his new government 
and its program may 22 
the free democrats campaigned on a platform of swift transfer to 
a free market economy while the hungarian democratic forum 
emphasized the need to avoid social disruption and generally 
emphasizes conservative traditional values

billionaire adnan khashoggi claimed ownership of 
a wall street building allegedly bought by ferdinand and imelda 
marcos several months after a court order froze the marcoses 
assets a banker said wednesday 
john sanderson a citibank vice president testified that the 
representation was made by a khashoggi associate during a 
discussion in the summer of 1986 about a 39 million citibank loan 
that had been secured by the building 
sandersons testimony addressed the prosecutions allegations 
that khashoggi assumed ownership of four new york buildings held by 
the marcoses after a march 1986 injunction prohibited any transfer 
of their properties 
khashoggi a saudi financier who is charged with mail fraud and 
obstruction of justice is on trial in federal court with mrs 
marcos 
she is accused of helping her husband the late philippines 
president loot their nations treasury of more than 220 million 
using the money to support lavish living and to secretly buy the 
four buildings 
mrs marcos 60 also is charged with defrauding banks of more 
than 165 million in loans including the citibank loan to finance 
the real estate 
she has pleaded innocent to charges of racketeering 
racketeering conspiracy mail fraud and obstruction of justice 
sanderson said his initial dealings concerning the loan were 
with gliceria tantoco a close friend of mrs marcos mrs tantoco 
owner of a department store in manila also was charged in the 
indictment but is a fugitive 
sanderson testified that he had at least two meetings with mrs 
tantoco in 1984 and 1985 about problems with the wall street 
buildings management 
in july 1986 he learned that the management company was 2 
million behind in city real estate taxes and became concerned 
because any city claim would come before citibanks sanderson said 
a short time later he got a call from a karl peterson who told 
him he was working for khashoggi and said khashoggi was the 
buildings owner 
sanderson said the loan agreement had prohibited any transfer of 
the property without the banks written consent 
the bank started foreclosure on the loan in the fall of 1986 
because a substantial amount of interest and real estate taxes were 
not paid and required rehabilitation of the building was not 
undertaken sanderson said 
he left the account in the summer of 1988 but said he believed 
citibank did win a judgment and recover its money 
mrs marcos who fell ill tuesday with high blood pressure for a 
second time returned to court wednesday wearing a monitor 
shes feeling better today her attorney gerry spence said 
after the morning testimony

at the height of violence that rocked 
south koreas capital wednesday a young woman with a ponytail 
ducked into a doorway with a makeshift medical bag to aid a student 
bleeding from the head 
the thunder of volleys of police tear gas shells shook the 
ground clouds of acrid gas billowed along the street in front of 
her like great balls of fog nearby students gagged or vomited 
the girl carefully wrapped the young mans head with bandages 
and gave him a hug 
moments before the young man had been hurling firebombs at a 
us diplomatic building and yelling yankee go home his 
friends later forced riot policemen to kneel and then they beat 
them 
the two both radical students are among the elite of south 
koreas young those able to gain admittance to universities they 
are the pride of a country that equates education with prosperity 
yet they are a deep embarrassment in a society that values harmony 
most of the radical students claim they are serving their 
country the countrys government says most of them are naive 
leftists who have been brainwashed by communist north korean 
teachings some of them the government has said may be communist 
agents 
who are these students and what do they want 
radicals wear american jeans and sneakers carry their books in 
a backpack and look like college students everywhere they go to 
some of the best schools in south korea 
radical students number only about 5 percent of the roughly 1 
million students in college other students listen to their 
rallies read their newspapers or may agree with some of their 
views but they do not usually participate 
radicals are demanding more democratic reforms from a government 
they claim has been too slow to do so they view the january merger 
of the governing party with two opposition parties as a political 
coup intended to prolong a hold on power without an election 
down with president roh taewoo they shout many feel an 
overthrow of the government could solve the countrys problems but 
offer few details on how a new leader could do better 
radicals claim washington makes decisions for a seoul puppet 
government they demand the withdrawal of 43000 us troops based 
in south korea because they say their presence hinders unification 
talks with north korea 
none of them are old enough to remember the bloody 195053 
korean war launched by north korea the war in which 5 million 
americans served some of them say they have never talked to an 
american 
at protests women collect rocks wave banners tend to injuries 
and sing support songs men deployed in platoon fashion hurl 
firebombs and rocks 
the radical student movement lost momentum after roh took office 
in february 1988 promising broad democratic reforms the smaller 
numbers forced radicals to become more violent to be noticed some 
began to use homemade explosives 
the government privately worries the violent protests could 
breed discontent among older south koreans especially laborers who 
often feel underprivileged and underpaid 
with escalating prices and doubledigit inflation rohs 
government has declined in popularity and its mindful of 
studentworker alliances that have wrought change in the past 
in 1960 hundreds of thousands of students took to the streets 
to demand the fall of president syngman rhee regime in 1987 
hundreds of thousands of students spurred an authoritarian former 
president chun doohwan to make reforms discontented workers 
joined those protests 
in korea protests are a statement the president of a seoul 
university said on condition of anonymity eventually the country 
may mature enough not to have to make the statement with violence 
its embarrassing

a puzzling breakdown in columbias 
cooling system has forced nasa to delay next weeks scheduled 
shuttle launch by an estimated two to three weeks the space agency 
said wednesday 
columbia had been scheduled to lift off may 16 or may 17 with 
seven astronauts and the 100 million astro observatory capable of 
probing ultraviolet and xray radiation but engineers this week 
spotted a problem with a valve that controls the flow of coolant in 
the shuttle 
we are obviously disappointed that we are not ready to fly 
said william lenoir head of nasas space flight program 
however this particular system is absolutely critical to the 
safety of the crew and overall mission success so we have decided 
to change the component 
nasa had hoped to confirm a launch date at the end of the 
twoday flight readiness review meeting on wednesday afternoon but 
that did not occur mission managers agreed an apparently faulty 
valve would have to be replaced and that the work could be done at 
the launch pad 
they dont understand the problem enough to feel comfortable 
flying with it so theyve got to go in and fix it said bascom 
murrah a nasa official in charge of prelaunch operations for 
columbia 
we feel we can do that at the pad but how long that will take 
i really would only be guessing 
launch teams expect to have a better idea by early next week as 
to how long the job will take nasa said in a statement the agency 
has never replaced a cooling valve at the launch pad 
returning columbia to its hangar for the valve to be replaced 
would have resulted in a considerably longer delay 
nasa said mission managers decided that completing the 
replacement and checkout on the pad is as safe and effective as 
performing the work in the shuttles hangar 
engineers noticed the problem sunday when there was an 
unexplained change in the flow of coolant 
the valve is in one of columbias two freon cooling loops 
beneath the payload bay liners it controls the proportion and rate 
of freon distributed between the crew cabin heat exchanger and the 
cooling system for payloads 
columbias nine to 10day flight will be the 36th shuttle 
mission provided it goes before an atlantis mission in july it 
also will be the first spacelab mission since 1985

firefighters aided by cool damp weather 
gained the upper hand wednesday over two forest fires that 
blackened more than 12 square miles of dry woods and grasslands and 
destroyed 75 homes 
up to 300 people were evacuated from their homes most of them 
along the au sable river after the fires broke out tuesday in a 
sparsely populated section of the northern lower peninsula 
authorities said 
the only known casualty was a firefighter treated for smoke 
inhalation said scott heather assistant regional forest manager 
with the state department of natural resources 
the larger fire began five miles east of grayling fanned by 
20mph gusts it burned an 8by1mile swath of woods and 
grassland and destroyed 66 houses and more than 30 other structures 
such as shacks and garages heather said 
we feel at this point weve got the fire 75 percent 
controlled he said the weather conditions are with us its 
cool and damp we dont anticipate any further problem 
flames persisted in a mainly marshy area where it was difficult 
to bring in firefighting equipment heather said 
the second fire broke out 10 miles to the south in southern 
crawford and northern roscommon counties 
it consumed 450 acres and nine homes and five other structures 
before being brought under control early wednesday with help from a 
quarterinch of rain that fell overnight heather said 
light rain continued wednesday as four national guard 
helicopters dumped 185gallon buckets of water on flames 
about 30 evacuees spent tuesday night at nearby camp grayling a 
michigan national guard base about 100 turned up at a red cross 
center wednesday to obtain warm clothing and instructions for 
seeking financial help 
this one little old lady in particular struck me said 
crawford county sheriffs deputy heide miller who was meeting 
evacuees at the door she had apparently got word her house was 
gone she was in shock 
the cause of the fires remained under investigation heather 
said other department of natural resources officials said they 
suspected a trash fire had gotten out of hand 
most of the northern lower peninsula went 13 days without any 
rain and longer than that without a heavy downpour said 
meteorologist chuck defever of the national weather services ann 
arbor office in addition snow melted early this year allowing 
undergrowth to become very dry 
gov james blanchard and department director david hales arrived 
to survey the damage 
up to 150 department and local firefighters battled the blazes 
at their peak late tuesday but only about 75 remained wednesday 
afternoon heather said 
miller said most residents would find out wednesday evening 
whether their homes were among the few saved when firefighters 
expected to remove road barricades 
there will be a lot of broken hearts said bill mahalak 
acting regional forest manager with the department of natural 
resources 
the areas yearround population is relatively sparse but grows 
when cabin owners visit for the summer and fall drawn by deer or 
bear hunting and trout fishing along the au sable river 
norbert szkotnicki said he snuck past police barricades to check 
on his home along the river he found part of it burning 
i got a chain saw and cut off a burning corner of the 
cabin he said firefighters then arrived and doused the house

record floods that are saturating 
hundreds of houses are striking at people who often dont have 
flood insurance a state official says some cant get it some 
cant afford it and some dont bother 
flood insurance is a hot topic while the arkansas river is 
slopped over its banks the river crested tuesday to a record level 
at little rock and was expected reach 48 feet wednesday at pine 
bluff a foot above flood stage 
fa crockett wishes he hadnt let his flood insurance policies 
lapse a few years ago he says he cant recall getting a renewal 
notice for his flood insurance and assumed he no longer needed it 
i went along for years and didnt think nothing about it 
said the 72yearold crockett who owns a used car dealership i 
dont know much about insurance except that i pay the premium 
now water is waist deep or higher in five houses he owns 
statewide about 500 homes are under water between 250 and 300 
of them in jefferson county official said corps of engineers 
spokesman pj spaul put early estimates of flood damage at 15 
million to 20 million statewide 
the damage to agriculture is not yet tallied cattlemen say 
hundreds of cattle have drowned or are trapped by flood waters the 
spring wheat crop is lost in some counties and flooded fields 
further delay spring rice planting 
jefferson county probably will lose onesixth of its 60 million 
annual agricultural sales said frank plafcan of the county 
extension office 
a federal disaster declaration for arkansas flooded counties 
could come later this week civil defense officials said 
in texas where flooding and heavy rains have claimed 12 lives 
in the last two weeks and president bush declared disaster areas in 
16 counties the red cross estimates that 4000 homes have been 
damaged or destroyed by flooding 
officials in texas say the first federal disaster relief checks 
are being handed out in 1383 requests for help the federal 
emergency management agency has received since may 2 
arkansas officials say they dont know how many flood victims 
have no flood insurance only how many arkansans have it it is 
low i know that said alison mccollum of the state soil and 
water conservation commission 
as of march 31 there were 7628 flood insurance policies in 
arkansas paying premiums that totaled 1687926 said fema 
official greg solovey 
solovey said 337 areas in arkansas participate in the federal 
insurance program but some areas along the arkansas river arent 
in the program and property owners in those areas must absorb any 
losses due to flood damage 
ms mccollum said people ignore the need for flood insurance 
because they think its expensive but its not as expensive as 
people think she added 
flood insurance costs are not astronomical she said 
people should check because i know it gets out that you just 
cant afford it if people dont live in a designated flood plain 
they can get very good rates 
wanda irving who was forced by rising water to leave her home 
here said she had to get flood insurance to finance her house she 
pays 119 a year to insure the house and its contents she said 
tina mullins a sales representative said flood insurance rates 
vary but generally are inexpensive in north little rock a premium 
of 100 a year will buy 40500 worth of coverage on a house and 
1000 on contents 
the federal government underwrites all flood insurance programs 
and only those who live in cities towns or counties that 
participate in the governments national flood insurance program 
can obtain flood insurance 
to join a flood program a city or community must agree to 
certain land management goals 
in other words stop the shopping centers from building in a 
flood zone area stop the developers from putting in a residential 
area where its going to flood said bill starkey of the 
independent insurance agents of arkansas 
the federal government subsidizes flood insurance to restrict 
building in flood plains and because flood insurance never can pay 
for itself he said 
the people on the mountain top dont buy it only the ones 
next to the river starkey said

newsday turned a reprimand into a suspension for 
jimmy breslin after the pulitzer prizewinning columnist went on a 
radio show and spoke flippantly about his racial and sexual tirade 
against another reporter 
don forst the editor of new york newsday announced the 
twoweek suspension without pay late tuesday 
jiyeon yuh a koreanamerican reporter who was the target of 
the columnists epithets said wednesday the punishment was 
appropriate 
i think newsday did the right thing yuh said from her desk 
at the newspapers office in queens i think when these kinds of 
things happen you really need to send a strong message that it is 
completely unacceptable 
asianamerican staffers who had told management that the 
reprimand and breslins apology were not enough called off a 
planned byline strike 
calls to breslins apartment wednesday for comment were met with 
busy signals 
forsts announcement of the suspension said the newspaper had 
believed breslins apology in response to its reprimand of his 
conduct had been genuine and sincere 
but his radio conversation tuesday morning with howard stern 
indicates a lack of sensitivity to what has been and continues to 
be a painful episode for all of us he said 
stern is a talkshow host who has tangled with the federal 
communications commission over his sexual and ethnic jokes 
breslin 61 telephoned stern while he was on the air and 
bantered about what may occur when he attends the approaching 
wedding of his nephew to a korean woman breslin said he called the 
program at the urging of his children because stern was devoting 
much of his show to the controversy 
i think that even without the howard stern show he should 
have been suspended yuh said 
the brouhaha was touched off when yuh criticized as sexist a 
column breslin wrote last week complaining that women officials 
especially his wife a member of the new york city council didnt 
spend enough time at home 
yuh delivered her comments to breslin the following day via 
interoffice computer memo breslin roared his response to other 
newsday staffers in the manhattan office describing yuh who was 
not present with an obscenity and calling her yellow cur and 
slanteyed 
later friday afternoon breslin submitted an apology to 
newsdays staff in an internal computer message in which he said 
i am no good and once again i can prove it i am sorry i 
said things i shouldnt have said the racial and sexual insults i 
spewed are never appropriate 
he apologized again in his column on monday 
after meeting with protesting staffers tuesday evening and 
saying they did not intend to go beyond rebuking breslin the 
newspapers editors listened to a tape of the columnist on sterns 
program and decided to suspend him 
breslins wife ronnie m eldridge issued a statement wednesday 
defending him and saying he is neither racist nor sexist 
he is an artist he has written fine books and memorable 
columns his view of the world is special and consistent and 
wonderful she said but he is also outrageous and he has a 
quick and miserable temper he lost it the other day and said 
terrible and regrettable things sadly for him he found no 
compassion or forgiveness 
his comments on the radio show she said were a poor attempt 
at humor

luxembourgs envoy to nato has quit after he 
committed a minor security infraction foreign minister jacques 
poos said wednesday 
he told parliament that guy de muyser 64 resigned on april 25

the north atlantic treaty organization 
indicating the infraction was minor poos said de muyser will 
remain envoy to belgium 
luxembourg traditionally combines the two brussels 
ambassadorships 
sources said the security breach stemmed from trips de muyser 
made to the soviet union where he gave out nato documents whose 
contents had already been publicly reported 
on april 25 the government citing preventive reasons 
withdrew de muysers security clearance denying him access to 
secret nato papers and effectively forcing his resignation that 
same day 
the sources spoke on the condition of not being identified 
officials at nato headquarters declined to comment on the case 
de muyser became nato ambassador in 1986 he was envoy to the 
soviet union from 1981 to 1983 during the 1970s he held senior 
positions at the palace of grand duke jean luxembourgs monarch 
de muyser was not available for comment wednesday a man 
answering the phone at his brussels residence said the envoy was 
vacationing in france

investigators seized a homemade poisoning 
guide boxloads of chemicals and bondage gear from a man charged 
with the 1988 poisonings of his neighbors according to court 
records unsealed wednesday 
the property of george james trepal 41 who was arrested and 
charged last month with firstdegree murder attempted murder and 
product tampering was listed in an itembyitem inventory 
if you believe everything youve heard so far sure it looks 
bad but when our side is finally heard youll see the whole 
picture said defense attorney jonathan stidham whos called his 
client a bit of a different person 
prosecutors say trepal a computer programmer and mensa member 
used poisonspiked bottles of cocacola to kill neighbor peggy carr 
of alturas and poison her husband and children leaving two of them 
partially paralyzed 
in the six years before the poisonings trepal complained about 
the carrs dogs chasing his cats loud radios the carr children 
played and the allterrain vehicles they rode police said 
and in the months prior to the october 1988 poisonings the 
carrs were mailed a typed warning you and all your socalled 
family have two weeks to move out of florida forever or else you 
all die this is no joke 
mrs carr lapsed into a coma and died in march 1989 an fbi 
analysis of the cocacola showed it was laced with highly toxic 
thallium nitrate 
when questioned in 1988 trepal said his only knowledge of 
thallium came from tv news according to authorities but trepal 
was convicted in 1975 and served three years in prison for running 
a drug lab in north carolina that produced 7 million in illegal 
methamphetamines thallium is used in amphetamine manufacture 
bottles of the poison found in the garage of trepals alturas 
home late last year led to his arrest and further searches 
according to court documents 
among the things seized from trepals home in sebring where he 
moved late last year were boxloads of labeled and unlabeled 
chemicals laboratory equipment and a neat green ledger on 
poisoning according to authorities 
it looked to be a homemade journal with different pages from 
different books placed in it its a very extensive book 
polk county detective ernie mincey said during a court hearing last 
month 
detectives seized hundreds of books in trepals home but listed 
one in particular pale horse an agathie christie murder 
mystery in which a chemist kills many people by putting thallium in 
makeup medicine and foods 
trepal and his wife orthopedic surgeon diana carr were members 
of mensa an organization for people of high intelligence diana 
carr is not related to the victims family and has not been charged 
in april 1989 trepal and his wife organized the groups 
murder mystery weekend investigators said 
a booklet of background material trepal prepared for the event 
detailed a staged voodoo poisoning death one passage of that 
seized book reads when a death threat appears on the doorstep 
prudent people throw out all their food and watch what they eat 
according to court documents 
more than 60 books and six videotapes on bondage were also found 
in the sebring home along with leather bondage tools the search 
warrants showed 
detectives testified in detail last month about finding a 
soundproof torturetype room in the basement complete with a 
flat wooden bed and stirrups we believe it was probably used in 
bondage mincey said 
in addition to the search of the sebring and alturas homes 
detectives also searched a miniwarehouse trepal rented diana 
carrs medical office and her airplane warrants showed 
the prosecution has come out with a lot of evidence defense 
lawer jonathan stidham said wednesday its all very interesting 
but none of it shows my client put thallium in coke bottles and put 
it in these peoples home

two auctions of contemporary art featured lower 
prices this week suggesting that the market has stopped its 
frenzied climb upward and buyers are becoming more selective art 
experts said wednesday 
the experts said the contemporary art market is still healthy 
and they did not fear a bust even though many paintings didnt 
sell or sold well below their estimated prices 
people are more than willing to pay top sums for excellent 
pieces of art but are not willing to pay inflated prices for 
secondrate works of art said larry gagosian a madison avenue 
art dealer 
roy lichtensteins kiss ii from 1962 a cartoon image of a 
young couple kissing sold at christies auction house in new york 
city on monday for 6 million the highest price ever paid for a 
work by the artist its presale estimate was 5 million to 7 
million 
at that same sale 26 artworks out of 77 offered failed to find 
buyers because no bids reached the minimum set by the seller the 
auction house sold 4017 million worth of art well below its 
presale estimate of 50 million to 718 million 
at rival sothebys on tuesday 32 artworks out of 87 went 
unsold and the sale brought in 559 million against house 
expectations of 866 million to 1129 million 
still cy twomblys 1971 untitled blackboard painting fetched 
55 million the most ever paid at auction for a work by the 
artist 
i think a lot of the hysteria has gone out of the market 
said milton esterow editor and publisher of artnews 
allan stone a new york dealer agreed whats been going on 
the last couple years has been absolute insanity he said 
they said selective buying was replacing the buying sprees of 
the last several years but the change doesnt indicate the art 
market had hit rocky times 
i think the business will remain very good said gagosian 
some experts particularly art dealers have blamed sothebys 
and christies for creating unrealistic price expectations among 
consignors who place their art with the auction houses for sale 
the problem i think is that too many collectors are too 
greedy and the auction houses have not put their feet down strongly 
enough in telling collectors that their reserves have no relation 
to reality esterow said 
auction houses and sellers agree to a reserve price below which 
an artwork cannot be sold it is in our interest to give the 
consigner the most accurate estimate we can its also in our 
interest to make sure the painting sells nash said 
david nash senior vice president in charge of fine arts at 
sothebys said there was something of a rather frenzied and 
heated atmosphere over the last several years which we knew could 
not be sustained 
we sort of had the feeling you could sell almost anything 
regardless of price and we knew this was not an ideal place for 
the market to be in 
nash said the turnover for the auction houses contemporary art 
department in 1984 was 13 million compared to 250 million in 
1989 during the last three years prices of artworks were doubling 
every six months he said 
he called the change in the market a healthy development 
christopher burge president of christies said contemporary 
art prices had been pushed to their limit in recent several years

in the race to become the champions of 
big breakfasts civicminded chefs in western massachusetts have 
stirred oceans of batter flipped mountains of pancakes and brewed 
rivers of coffee 
rival battle creek mich has served up cereal pop tarts 
doughnut holes and tang cold 
were not talking apples and apples and oranges and oranges 
says state rep athan catjakis a cochairman of this saturdays 
breakfast in springfield 
officials hope to dish up 35000 pancake breakfasts to hang on 
to the biggest breakfast title wrested from battle creek last year 
by a margin of about 1000 breakfasts served battle creek answers 
the challenge june 9 
springfield ore which tried and failed to beat its 
massachusetts namesake in 1989 will send mayor william e 
morisette and his wife to pick up pointers although no immediate 
challenge is planned 
as far as a pancake breakfast i dont think theres anybody 
in the united states that can touch us catjakis said its a 
lot easier to take a box of cereal and pour some milk 
officials in battle creek home of three major cereal makers 
defended their menu is it fair you bet said spokeswoman 
helen royal 
she said battle creek with a population of about 70000 is at 
a disadvantage to springfield a city of about 150000 so the 
michigan city has to work harder to get the big numbers 
besides cereal goes back a long way in battle creek home of 
the kellogg co the post division of general foods corp and 
ralston purina co she said 
we are the cereal capital of the world thats a title that we 
really honor and that we defend and were the only city in the 
world that can claim that right royal said 
battle creek held a free cereal breakfast in 1956 to celebrate 
the 50th anniversary of the founding of kellogg the event was 
repeated four times from 1958 to 1962 the tradition was resumed in 
1976 
a decade later springfield set up a table on main street and 
served 24000 pancake breakfasts to celebrate its 350th anniversary 
we were looking for something different to do catjakis said 
the cities first competed for worlds longest breakfast 
table but after that became logistically difficult the race 
switched to feeding the most people 
battle creek won in 1987 and 1988 but in 1989 springfield won 
with 33869 breakfasts served battle creek officials blamed a 
cold windy day for only attracting 32856 people 
in 1987 springfield tried serving cereal but it bombed with 
new england breakfasteaters catjakis said 
the springfield pancakes provided by a restaurant chain at 
150 per adult calls for 600 pounds of egg yolks 220 pounds of 
butter 3000 pounds of flour and 400 gallons of water sixteen 
griddles are used and the flapjacks are served with 2000 pounds of 
butter and 200 gallons of maple syrup 
six hundred gallons of coffee and orange juice complete the meal

the acting head of the general services 
administration said wednesday the defense department not the gsa 
should pay for the 11 billion renovation of the pentagon 
richard g austin told a house public works and transportation 
panel that he supports the transfer of the pentagon from his 
agencys control to the defense department a step expected later 
this year 
once the transfer takes place the defense department should 
handle the expense of repairing the 48yearold building 
the renovation and modernization of the pentagon building will 
create unique security problems and the logistical difficulties 
inherent in any major renovation will be complicated by the 
extremely high sensitivity of the building tenants austin said 
the acting gsa administrator also told the subcommittee on 
public buildings and grounds that the cost of 11 billion over 
seven years for the pentagon repair would place a significant 
demand for resources on the federal building fund 
earlier this year sen james sasser dtenn chairman of the 
senate appropriations subcommittee on military construction said 
the bush administrations request for 11 billion to renovate the 
pentagon is out of the question 
sasser acknowledged that the building is in need of repair but 
said the administrations call for 11 billion over seven years 
would be difficult to heed in a time of shrinking budgets 
the military construction bill is going to get smaller not 
larger sasser said theres simply no room for such an 
undertaking 
the pentagon the largest office building in the world has 175 
miles of corridors 131 stairways 19 escalators and 13 elevators 
and covers 29 acres in northern virginia

an interstate probe of computer hacking has 
uncovered losses that may reach millions of dollars and could be 
just the tip of the iceberg federal law enforcement officials 
said wednedsay 
no computercrime arrests resulted however when 27 search 
warrants served in a dozen cities were served by 150 secret service 
agents and police on tuesday officials said three people one 
each in chicago los angeles and pittsburgh were arrested for 
unrelated offenses officials said 
secret service officials declined to release any specifics 
including the number of people targeted saying the twoyear 
investigation codenamed operation sun devil was continuing 
the probe is focused on illegal entry into computer systems and 
unauthorized use of creditcard numbers and longdistance codes 
said garry m jenkins assistant secret service director for 
investigations 
the losses that we estimate on this may run to the millions of 
dollars said us attorney for arizona stephen mcnamee who 
joined jenkins and arizona attorney general bob corbin at a news 
conference 
most of you have been taking this as a game corbin told 
reporters it is not a game theyre not all kids theyre 
adults too 
much of the alleged loss stems from unpaid telephone and 
computer access charges the officials said 
they said it was possible that hackers had gotten goods or cash 
through use of unauthorized credit cards but could not cite any 
instance of it 
in addition to misuse of credit cards and phone lines the 
hackers are believed to have gotten into computers that store 
medical and financial histories the officials said 
the case appears to be the largest so far in the field said 
assistant us attorney tim holtzen however it is probably only 
the tip of the iceberg when it comes to computer crime he said 
statements from the secret service and the justice department 
gave conflicting information on the number and locations of the 
cities where searches were made 
in addition to searches in or near phoenix there were searches 
conducted this week in or near chicago cincinnati detroit los 
angeles miami newark nj new york city pittsburgh richmond 
va plano texas and san diego 
also listed in some of the statements were san jose calif 
saginaw mich san francisco and tucson officials said they were 
unable to explain the discrepancies 
documents on the search warrants will be sealed pending further 
investigation assistant attorney general gail thackery said 
under new computer crime laws the secret service has 
jurisdiction to investigate allegations of electronic fraud through 
the use of access devices such as creditcard numbers and codes 
longdistance companies issue to individual callers 
defendants convicted of unauthorized use of such access 
devices can be sentenced up to 10 years in prison if they commit 
fraud of more than 1000 according to the law 
a similar investigation supervised by federal prosecutors in 
chicago has resulted in several indictments

attorney general dick thornburgh said 
wednesday he has asked congress to stiffen criminal penalties for 
cross burnings and other forms of racial harassment that do not 
result in personal injuries 
the proposed amendments to the landmark 1968 civil rights act 
would make cross burnings a felony under federal law punishable by 
a fiveyear prison sentence and a fine up to 250000 
the offense is now a misdemeanor that carries a maximum oneyear 
sentence and a 100000 fine 
misdemeanor penalties would be retained to allow prosecutors to 
bring lesser charges in appropriate cases the department said in a 
letter to congress 
the harsher penalties are proposed for what thornburgh called 
particularly egregious cases those where firearms are used or 
fire or threats of fire including cross burnings are employed 
thornburghs statement cited a case in which people who burned 
down a home rented by a black family were prosecuted for a 
misdemeanor because there were no injuries 
the law would also apply to situations in which shots are fired 
into homes but there are no injuries prosecutors would have to 
prove racial or ethnic harassment motivated the incident 
in another case prosecutors could only bring misdemeanor 
charges against people accused of burning down a house trailer 
occupied by a biracial family thornburgh said 
the proposed amendments deal with the use or the threat of force 
to interfere with a citizens right to fair housing 
the message of hatred and violence that cross burnings convey 
inflicts enormous psychological damage on victims particularly 
children who live in a targeted house the justice department 
said its letter to congress last month that was released wednesday 
frequently lives are disrupted as families flee neighborhoods 
altogether or members alter schedules to protect their families and 
homes said the letter by bruce c navarro the acting head of 
the departments legislative affairs office 
state charges of arson may be filed by local prosecutors in many 
jurisdictions these crimes carry heavier penalties 
but cross burning is often treated as malicious mischief and 
shootings that do not result in injuries may be minor felonies 
such as assault or attempted assault 
local authorities may not be willing to invest the time to 
investigate a crime that carries a light penalty said daniel 
rinzel head of the justice department unit that prosecutes hate 
crimes 
most cross burnings take some work to try to figure out who 
did it rinzel said 
there are some incidents that you could consider to be serious 
simply because people were lucky they werent injured but are 
nonetheless treated as misdemeanors by the law rinzel said

a scottish drifter who critically wounded 
actress theresa saldana in a 1982 stabbing has agreed to return to 
england to face charges in a homicide committed there nearly 23 
years ago 
arthur richard jackson 53 waived extradition proceedings 
during a tuesday hearing before us magistrate venetta s 
tassopulos 
jackson could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted in the 
shooting death of a passerby during a june 1967 bank robbery in 
london said angus mackay britains vice consul in los angeles 
jackson still faces trial in los angeles superior court on 
charges he sent 16 threatening letters to miss saldana 34 while 
serving a 12year prison term for attacking her with a kitchen 
knife outside her west hollywood apartment on march 15 1982 
the actress was hospitalized for 3 months and underwent five 
major operations to repair wounds to her heart lungs legs and 
arms 
it is our intention to try him on those charges and convict 
him here said sandi gibbons a district attorneys spokeswoman 
but he can serve his sentence anywhere in england as well as the 
united states once weve convicted him england is welcome to have 
him 
the charges filed last june were based on seven letters jackson 
is accused of sending miss saldana and former water delivery man 
jeff fenn who rescued miss saldana during the 1982 stabbing attack 
and held jackson for police 
jackson allegedly wrote in one letter that he regretted using a 
knife because a gun would have given me a better chance of 
reunion with you in heaven authorities say 
jackson had a history of mental problems when he entered the 
united states illegally in 1982 
in britain jackson is accused of killing a passerby who chased 
him after the june 1967 bank robbery he also is accused of 
wounding two bank employees in that robbery as well as two other 
armed robberies in 1965 and 1967 
jackson was not identified as a suspect in those crimes until 
june 1987 when he sent scotland yard a letter admitting his 
involvement and saying he wanted to be extradited to england 
immediately us court documents say 
miss saldanas agent morgan paul said he worried that jackson 
would avoid a long prison term in england and return to the united 
states to stalk the actress again 
he has been extradited three previous times and hes always 
gotten back here paul said we want a sure thing we want to 
know where he is at all times

a lawsuit filed against the fbi after the 
agencys illfated investigation of an organization opposed to us 
intervention in central america was dismissed by a federal judge 
wednesday 
us district court judge george revercomb granted the fbis 
motion to end the lawsuit filed by cispes the committee in 
solidarity with the people of el salvador 
the case is moot because the fbi agreed feb 24 to transfer all 
records pertaining to cispes to the national archives revercomb 
said 
the fbi investigated cispes for alleged terrorist activity based 
on a tip from a paid informant who was found to be untrustworthy 
earlier the fbi conceded that its investigation was flawed 
disciplined a number of agents and amended its guidelines for 
conducting investigations 
the group said the feb 24 agreement does not cover copies of 
cispes records provided to other agencies such as the terrorist 
information center the state department or foreign police agencies 
the fbi can only dispose of records over which they have 
custody or control revercomb said information and records 
already disseminated are beyond the disposal power of the 
bureau 
cispes sought an injunction directing the fbi to recover all 
copies of its files and computer data bases and to deposit them 
with the archives 
people have to get more sophisticated about potential 
government abuse and understand it can occur with computers as well 
as paper said margaret ratner an attorney representing the 
committee 
she said cispes had not been allowed to see the agreement 
between the fbi and the archives and that she doubted computer 
files had been purged 
revercomb said that although cispes records have been 
distributed to other agencies the possibility that a federal 
employer is going to contact these other entities for security 
checks is too remote to be tenable 
members of a number of groups were placed under surveillance as 
a result of the fbi investigation and spinoff probes cispes 
alleged the fbi had violated the first amendment and the privacy 
act of 1974

tanks missiles and troops paraded through red 
square on wednesday to celebrate the world war ii defeat of nazi 
germany stirring emotions over the reunification of a former foe 
and the secession of three republics 
military danger still exists in the world defense minister 
marshal dmitri t yazov said moments before he sent five new pieces 
of military hardware roaring past the assembled kremlin leadership 
and western spectators 
yazov who led a rifle regiment in world war ii also praised in 
his speech the new thinking of president mikhail s gorbachev 
which he said had lowered tensions in a europe that was divided 
after the nazi defeat in 1945 
gorbachev did not address the event but smiled at participants 
as he led the leadership onto lenins mausoleum to watch 
western diplomats applauded as he left the tribunal afterward 
and in salute he raised a bouquet presented by military cadets 
during the ceremony 
the celebration affected other soviets differently 
some veterans interviewed after the parade expressed misgivings 
about german reunification one senior naval officer thundered i 
killed germans then and if i have to ill kill them again he 
refused to give his name to an american reporter 
emotions also ran high in the baltic republics of lithuania 
latvia and estonia which the soviet union forcibly annexed during 
the war but which have moved toward independence this year 
the army staged victory day rallies in all three baltic 
capitals and in latvia and lithuania they turned into 
demonstrations for and against secession 
in latvia which declared independence on may 4 a rally turned 
into a march by 5000 protesters supported by the communist party 
and military 
we consider the declaration of independence a defeat for 
everyone said lt gen oleg zinchenko head of the political 
directorate of the baltic military region which encompasses the 
three republics 
zinchenko saying he spoke for the armed forces said appeals 
from the military to the kremlin to intervene more forcefully in 
the baltics were not signs of weakness 
nothing could be more dangerous than that misperception he 
told the crowd many of whom waved bright red banners as well as 
latvian flags emblazoned with the soviet hammer and sickle 
in the lithuanian capital of vilnius a witness said 200 people 
tried to block a victory day procession they shouted occupiers 
go home as the veterans marched along gediminas avenue near a 
monument to soviet gen ivan chernyakhovsky a world war ii hero 
the protesters tried to block the veterans who were apparently 
russians but a cordon of paratroopers prevented them said pranas 
karlonas a lithuanian radio editor 
lithuania declared independence on march 11 and latvia followed 
suit on may 4 on tuesday estonia took some steps toward 
independence without formally declaring it 
in the estonian capital of tallinn the soviet army paraded but 
there were no confrontations said neme bruus an editor at 
estonian radio 
at the red square parade in moscow the army took the unusual 
step of displaying five new pieces of hardware some of which had 
never been seen by western military observers 
i think its a very strong message that the army is still 
valued within soviet society that theyre still a capable force 
and that theyre still valued by president gorbachev said henry 
dodds editor of janes soviet intelligence review in an interview 
broadcast by britains sky tv 
the motorized portion of the parade began with an echelon of 
t34 tanks which were first produced in 1943 and were the 
workhorse of soviet armor in the march to berlin 
overall the soviets showed 18 modern weapons systems 
for the military buffs there were some very interesting pieces 
of equipment the first thing that we saw was a new armored 
personnel carrier dodds said referring to a bmd2 airborne 
combat vehicle equipped with an antitank missile and designed to 
be dropped with paratroopers 
this is absolutely brand new there was only some suggestion 
of it having been in existence towards the end of last year and it 
was absolutely remarkable to see it being displayed in moscow 
today dodds said 
a senior western military attache said the centerpiece of the 
soviet display was a new sam10 surface to air missile long sleek 
trucks each carried four of the new missles inside cannisters 
painted in camouflage 
another hot item in the soviet parade was the latest tank a 
t80 variant known to the west as the soviet medium tank 1989 for 
the year it entered service said the nato officer 
one thing missing from the parade was an american legion 
marching band that traveled to moscow from massachusetts soviet 
officials initially told the band it could march but said 
wednesday it would not be allowed onto red square 
instead the 70member band played outside the bolshoi theater 
and band leader dorothy dot hill said she was not disappointed 
victory day was far more impressive to me than where it was 
she said having it where they had it was perfect it couldnt 
have been any better

tens of thousands of students 
dissidents and radicals battled riot police in more than a dozen 
cities wednesday to demand the ouster of president roh taewoo 
police arrested more than 900 people 
in downtown seoul students hurled rocks and firebombs in the 
most violent antigovernment protests in the capital since 1987 
dozens of police and protesters suffered injuries some serious 
but no figures were available 
protesters set fire to a us diplomatic building firebombed a 
police bus truck and jeep occupied the front of one of the 
capitals luxury hotels and took control of a fashionable downtown 
shopping area for more than three hours 
two us guards were slightly injured by rockthrowing 
demonstrators a state department spokesman richard boucher said 
in washington 
violence erupted as the newly created democratic liberal party 
held its inaugural convention radicals and dissidents claim the 
gigantic party a merger of three political groups will lead to 
dictatorship 
rohs party is declining in popularity as inflation rises but 
most south koreans do not support radicals who espouse violence 
yankee go home screamed thousands of students hurling 
firebombs and rocks down with roh taewoo 
at the height of the fighting some 15000 students rampaged 
through an area two or three miles wide from the seoul railway 
station to dondaemun market the countrys largest wholesale market 
protesters ripped up sidewalks and metal grating to make 
missiles street signs were taken apart to use as weapons against 
police armed with teargas masks truncheons and shields 
clouds of choking tear gas billowed over the center of this 
capital city of 10 million people sending office workers and 
shopkeepers racing for cover at the evening rush hour holding 
their mouth and nose to keep out the acrid gas 
thousands of riot police in the city center appeared to be taken 
by surprise as throngs of 300 to 2000 radical students dashed 
along sidewalks to occupy main downtown shopping streets 
screaming protesters overpowered at least two groups of 200 to 
300 riot police and seized their helmets clubs shields and other 
items students forced dozens of police to kneel with their hands 
behind their backs and shouted insults kicking and beating them 
with fists and clubs 
disband the dlp students yelled repeatedly 
after nightfall about 3000 students occupied a block around 
the us information service center for two hours before being 
driven back by volleys of tear gas fired from black armored police 
vans 
students broke at least seven windows at the fourstory center 
and threw firebombs into a firstfloor window touching off a fire 
that raged out of control for more than an hour with flames 
reaching up to the second story 
firefighters and us army fire trucks from the nearby american 
base extinguished the blaze after police regained control of the 
street 
the front gate of the center was shuttered and it was unknown 
whether there were people inside the building which includes a 
library and agriculture and trade offices 
boucher said the two injured us guards were outside the 
building he said no us personnel were known to be in the 
building during the fighting 
early indications are that there was considerable smoke and 
water damage to the building he told a news briefing in 
washington

zoo officials on wednesday announced the 
birth of the worlds first testtube tigers and said invitro 
fertilization could help preserve the endangered tiger population 
as well as other species 
dr lee simmons said two yellow tiger cubs and one white male 
were delivered by caesarian section on april 27 at omahas henry 
doorly zoo to the surrogate mother a 9yearold siberian tiger 
named nicole 
the parents of the three cubs were a white bengal tiger and two 
bengal tiger mothers simmons said 
the white male cub died shortly after birth because of 
respiratory complications unrelated to the invitro fertilization 
but the other two yellowandbrown striped cubs a male and a 
female are strong and healthy and being handreared at the omaha 
zoo simmons said 
the births mean preserving an endangered species is possible and 
helps the cause of researchers and zoos simmons said 
for some of the conservationists research has been a 
fourletter word simmons said 
seeing the two cuddly little cubs can help show that maybe 
research isnt such a bad thing he said 
three zoos doorly the national zoological park in washington 
dc and the minnesota zoological gardens in minneapolis have 
collaborated on the project for more than 10 years 
the invitro techniques have been used successfully in humans 
and in farm animals but progress has been slow in adapting the 
techniques to wild animals simmons said 
research has focused on tigers because at least three of the 
eight remaining tiger subspecies have become extinct in the past 20 
years and only 50 tigers remain in the critically endangered south 
china subspecies simmons said 
the program began with a national zoo research program using the 
techniques on domestic cats it is aimed at ultimately taking the 
technology and techniques into the wild simmons said 
he outlined a scenario that begins with frozen embryos from 
tigers in captivity in omaha or other zoos 
we go into the wild in india and nepal and capture a female 
for a short time he said 
during that time scientists would induce ovulation and collect 
the tigers eggs he said they also would transfer the frozen 
embryos to the wild tiger and turn her loose 
about 110 days later she would deliver cubs that she would 
raise in the wild simmons said they the cubs would expand 
and enhance the gene pool 
expanding the gene pool is important as the populations of 
endangered animals decrease simmons said 
as the habitats shrink and become more isolated the wild 
populations fall prey to inbreeding simmons said 
the dwindling habitat means that the tigers may still be 
running free in a forest but they have unfortunately become just 
as captive as animals in the zoo he said 
the techniques can help enhance the survival of the zoo 
captives and the wild captives simmons said 
the program in the wild still is years away as technology 
develops to make the mobile invitro lab really mobile simmons 
said 
the invitro technique involves a veterinarian treating the 
donor female tigers with a hormone to stimulate growth of follicles 
in the ovaries the eggs in the follicles then are stimulated to 
develop further with a second hormone injection 
a day later the tiger is anesthetized and examined the eggs 
then are collected with a needle inserted through the abdominal 
wall 
the eggs are placed with sperm collected from a male in a 
special medium in a warm incubator in 12 hours embryos are 
surgically transferred into the reproductive tract of the surrogate 
mother 
the tigers involved in this first birth all came from the omaha 
zoo which has 40 tigers one of the largest tiger populations in 
the world simmons said

foreign secretary douglas hurd said wednesday that 
direct talks with iran to secure the release of british hostages 
were possible if they were likely to produce results 
iran broke diplomatic relations with britain in feburary 1989 
after the countrys spiritual leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
urged moslems to kill indianborn british author salman rushdie for 
blaspheming islam in his novel the satanic verses 
britain has come under increasing pressure to try to free four 
hostages missing in lebanon following the release of american 
captives robert polhill and frank reed who strongly criticized 
british inaction 
i do not rule out the possibility of direct talks if we felt 
that they were likely to produce results but the restoration of 
diplomatic relations is certainly not a matter for us alone 
hurd told the house of commons 
we shall do everything we can to bring about the release of 
all the hostages short of making concessions or striking bargains 
with those who hold them because we want a safer world not a more 
dangerous one he said 
hurd acknowledged the syrian role in reeds release but added 
we broke with syria in 1986 on the issue of statesupported 
terrorism an issue that remains unresolved 
we have had indirect talks with them since then on behalf of 
the hostages 
britain cut diplomatic ties with damascus for allegedly using 
its embassy in london to help plot the unsuccessful destruction of 
an israeli jetliner at heathrow airport 
opposition labor party lawmaker gerald kaufman referring to 
reeds charge of british inaction asked hurd to say the 
government is active dayin dayout in efforts to secure the 
release of the british hostages 
hurd agreed people had every right to expect dayin dayout 
efforts and these were continuing 
i have every sympathy with mr frank reed but he is not in 
any position to know anything about the efforts we have made on 
behalf of the british hostages hurd said 
the hostages are church of england envoy terry waite journalist 
john mccarthy retired pilot jack mann and brian keenan a teacher 
who has dual british and irish nationality 
the foreign office says it also seeks word on alec collett a 
new yorkbased british journalist whose palestinian abductors claim 
they killed him his body was never found 
former liberal leader sir david steel suggested there was a case 
for considering the reopening of diplomatic links with libya and 
syria 
hurd said there were three substantial problems with iran 
the hostages the imprisonment of briton roger cooper on spying 
charges and the threat to kill rushdie 
labors harry barnes urged ministers to stop taking an 
intransigent stance in developing links with iran and syria and 
take a lead from the united states 
i have discussed policy with the us secretary of state mr 
james baker in the last few days and it is entirely on on 
allfours with that of the us hurd said 
lawmakers also criticized claims by british moslem leader sayed 
quddus that waite would be released by his beirut captors only if 
rushdie was extradited to iran 
quddus a former secretary of the council of mosques in bradford 
who was one of the first moslems in britain to publicly burn 
rushdies novel said he was told this during a recent visit to 
iran he said he was also told waite is alive and well 
conservative lawmaker gary waller said the idea of extraditing 
rushdie was totally outrageous 
the british hostages are among 16 westerners including six 
americans believed held in lebanon the longest held is terry 
anderson chief middle east correspondent of the associated press 
who was abducted march 16 1985

failure by the us military to issue a 
warning before attacking panamanian defense force headquarters may 
have led to the deaths of dozens of civilians living nearby a 
report said wednesday 
some 15000 persons were left homeless in the attack and a 
very rough estimate is that 50 to 70 civilians were killed 
according to the americas watch study conducted after the december 
invasion of panama 
many more were seriously wounded the report said 
the pentagon had no immediate comment 
americas watch which promotes human rights in latin america and 
the caribbean contends that both the us and panamanian military 
violated international humanitarian law governing armed conflict 
it said the us military failed to observe the laws of war in 
its attack on the pdf headquarters located in the midst of a poor 
panama city neighborhood called el chorrillo 
the report gave little credence to allegations by some observers 
that forces loyal to gen manuel antonio noriega were responsible 
for fires that broke out in el chorrillo and left numerous civilian 
casualties 
noriega was ousted by the invading force and later brought to 
the united states for trial on drug trafficking charges 
the study said us military leaders were unable to cite 
military necessity such as the need for surprise as a reason for 
not informing el chorrillo residents that an attack was imminent 
roman catholic priests said in january that about 20 people died 
in el chorrillo many in a fire set by retreating paramilitary 
supporters of noriega they said that nearly 10000 people sought 
refuge in the church and the school and a home for the elderly next 
to it 
the rev javier arteta said members of the panamanian 
paramilitary dignity battalions bear much of the blame for the 
casualties 
they came out of their homes shooting in every direction 
arteta said adding that the us military never fired in the 
direction of the church 
the americas watch report also said the us military failed to 
follow the laws of war in refusing to free prisoners after 
hostilities ceased 
noriegas forces violated international law by taking civilian 
hostages and by dressing as civilians during the fighting thus 
attracting fire and exposing innocent people to combat the report 
said 
the study said the us southern command in panama undercounted 
the number of civilian deaths the pentagon total was 202 but the 
report said 300 was more likely the real figure 
former us attorney general ramsey clark has estimated the 
death toll at 4000 to 7000 but the report said there was no

supporters of a bill guaranteeing unpaid time 
off for workers in family emergencies cited president bushs own 
1988 campaign rhetoric wednesday saying he supported provisions in 
an election year that he now threatens to veto 
the house began debating the family and medical leave bill with 
a vote scheduled for thursday 
rep bill green rny a liberal republican who supports the 
bill quoted bush from a september 1988 campaign appearance in 
which he said the presidential candidate seemed to be supporting 
just such a measure 
bush green said told a republican womens group we need to 
assure that women dont have to worry about getting their jobs back 
after having a child or caring for a child during a serious 
illness that is what i mean when i talk about a gentler nation 
bushs press secretary marlin fitzwater said a day earlier that 
bush would veto the bill if passed and that while bush urged 
employers to offer guaranteed jobprotected leave he opposed any 
bill requiring periods of leave 
let me note he used the word assure green said referring 
to bushs campaign speech he didnt say we should urge employers 
to do it the only way we can do that is by legislation 
the bill would require businesses with 50 or more employees to 
offer unpaid time off for the care of newborn newly adopted or 
seriously ill children as well as to deal with personal health 
problems or ill spouses or parents 
house opponents of the bill charged it would be too costly and 
burdensome for businesses 
rep james quillen rtenn said it would reduce employers 
flexibility in offering benefits to employees 
this bill will do serious damage to many small businesses and 
mediumsized businesses quillen said 
rep bob carr dmich charged his own partys leaders were 
using unfair and heavyhanded tactics and trying to ram the 
bill through without permitting moderate amendments 
the family leave bill is the second of two major social issues 
that the white house has threatened to veto this year a conference 
committee has been named to work out house and senate differences 
on a broader bill providing designed to help families find and 
afford child care which also is under a veto threat 
under the bill sent to the house floor employers would have to 
offer up to 18 weeks of unpaid family leave over a twoyear period 
and up to 15 weeks a year for a sick worker a proposed substitute 
backed by the bills bipartisan supporters and expected to be 
adopted would change that to 12 weeks in both cases 
under the bill an employee returning from leave must be 
restored to his or her previous job or an equivalent position 
employers would have to continue health insurance benefits for 
those on leave 
womens groups supporting the bill contend that workers 
particularly women suffer substantial earnings losses after the 
birth of a child or during illnesses because many cant return to 
their jobs at the same pay 
business groups including the us chamber of commerce opposed 
the bill they charged it would be a costly burden for employers 
hurting productivity although the bill requires employers to offer 
only unpaid leave some opponents were concerned it could lead to 
later legislation requiring paid leave or other benefits 
the presidential veto threat was backed up in a formal 
statement of administration policy sent to congress by the 
office of management and budget saying the administration 
strongly opposes the bill 
if this or any other mandated leave legislation were presented 
to the president his senior advisers would recommend that it be 
vetoed the statement said 
it said the bill would induce employers to reduce overall 
employee benefits because of the expense of the new requirement

the two opposition candidates said 
wednesday they would withdraw from the presidential race if interim 
president ion iliescu also agreed to step down and let a newly 
elected parliament choose the president 
the offer came after violence and a prolonged antigovernment 
demonstration marred the first weeks of campaigning for the may 20 
elections 
presidential candidates ion ratiu of the national peasants 
party and radu campeanu of the national liberal party both suffered 
violent attacks during campaign appearances 
campeanu canceled campaign appearances this week after suffering 
cuts to the face in an assault in braila on saturday he said he 
hoped the withdrawal would restore a climate of peace and 
stability to the country 
the two opposition parties say supporters of iliescus national 
salvation front have disrupted their campaigns and are harassing 
their candidates 
wednesdays offer drew no immediate reply from iliescu who was 
out of bucharest at large campaign rallies 
the development highlighted the uncertainty surrounding the 
political process in romania almost five months after the december 
revolution that ousted communist dictator nicolae ceausescu and 
less than two weeks before elections 
in separate ballots voters are to choose a new parliament and a 
new president opinion polls whose reliability has been 
questioned by foreign observers heavily favor the front and 
iliescu who have dominated politics since the revolution 
a downtown bucharest demonstration against iliescu and the front 
entered its 18th day wednesday about 2000 people gathered to 
demand iliescus resignation and to shout slogans denouncing the 
front as neocommunists 
leading former dissident doina cornea said she was joining 56 
hunger strikers in the protest some have taken nothing but tea for 
10 days 
the demonstrators want former communist officials such as 
iliescu barred by law from politics 
campeanu and ratiu made their offer to withdraw at the request 
of an antigovernment group that wants the elections postponed 
police said wednesday they detained five people responsible for 
the attack on campeanu and filed charges against two of them a 
third was sent to a psychiatric hospital for examination all were 
from 28 and 39 years old 
the state news agency rompres said a man with six previous 
criminal convictions was jailed for 18 months for disturbing the 
peace during a campaign appearance by ratiu in buzau northeast of 
bucharest april 24 
iliescu meanwhile continued his campaign staterun radio said 
100000 people attended iliescus rally in the central city of 
brasov 
in liberty square in ploiesti 38 miles north of bucharest 
about 20000 enthusiastic front supporters heard iliescu dismiss 
the demands of the bucharest demonstrators as an electoral maneuver 
we love him because he took us out of ceausescus hell said 
ion radu a 66yearold peasant who was in the audience

ninetyfive antiabortion protesters held 
11 weeks in a vermont jail for failing to identify themselves after 
their arrests finally did so and were promptly released wednesday 
for some reason they all agreed to give their names be 
fingerprinted and signed a waiver of right to trial said edward 
sutton deputy states attorney 
under the agreement district judge matthew katz then found them 
guilty of unlawful trespass a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum 
of 90 days in jail they were sentenced and released for time 
served 
the protesters agreed to give their names after being told they 
would not have to pay bail or a fine and that no probation would be 
set on them said their lawyer daniel lynch 
in addition lynch said under the agreement they did not plead 
guilty to unlawful trespass instead they admitted to the facts of 
the case and were found guilty by the judge 
the 95 had been held without bail even though they were charged 
with only a misdemeanor because they refused to identify themselves 
in court 
many of us will be back said joan andrews 41 a founder of 
the antiabortion rescue movement in 1979 who was among those 
jailed if the movement here is being threatened again i will 
certainly try to make it back 
the protesters had been arrested following a series of sitins 
at two burlington abortion clinics between feb 21 and april 17 
frankly these people are not acting as individuals but as 
followers of a few leaders said sutton they take orders 
the protesters were jailed for up to 78 days about a week more 
than they most likely would have been held had they been tried and 
convicted 
during their arraignments they had identified themselves as 
baby jane doe and baby john doe the judges decision to 
hold them without bail for refusing to give their names is under 
appeal to the vermont supreme court 
only eight of the 95 protesters were from vermont the rest were 
from canada california iowa michigan new mexico ohio 
tennessee texas washington state and the northeast 
in addition to ms andrews several national leaders of the 
antiabortion movement were among those jailed they included the 
rev norman weslin 59 head of the victim souls for the unborn 
christ child headquartered in mountlake terrace wash 
the jailing cost the state of vermont 6000 a day

lithuanian prime minister kazimiera prunskiene 
said wednesday transportation and industry in the breakaway baltic 
republic will halt within two weeks because of the soviet economic 
blockade 
by may 25 we will have a crisis our reserves of crude oil 
will run out by then she said because of a lack of black 
crude oil and fuel light industry transport and in general 
different branches of our economy will close 
mrs prunskiene addressing a news conference after talks with 
prime minister margaret thatcher said her administration is saving 
emergency fuel supplies for hospitals and schools and was 
selfsufficient in food 
medicine was coming from poland she said 
and we have luck on our side because summer is coming up 
mrs prunskiene told reporters speaking through an interpreter 
she reiterated that lithuania will not rescind its march 11 
declaration of independence but again offered to compromise with 
moscow by suspending subsequent laws on citizenship and property 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has refused to negotiate 
with the baltic republic and retaliated against its declaration of 
independence with an economic blockade 
she said it appeared doubtful moscow would use force if the 
crisis worsened 
those who wanted to punish lithuania have actually been 
satisfied she said 
mrs prunskiene spoke at the end of a twoday visit to britain 
part of a tour to drum up support in the west she arrived after 
meeting with president bush in washington and will travel from 
london to paris and bonn 
she said mrs thatcher was sympathetic during their 75minute 
meeting but mrs prunskiene appeared to have gained little in 
substance mrs prunskiene saw similar results after he meeting 
with bush 
thatcher aides said britains priority remained not to upset 
gorbachev 
we dont want the apple cart upset but we do sympathize with 
them lithuanians said one british official speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
mrs prunskiene at the news conference at a house in west 
londons notting hill district used as a lithuanian center 
acknowledged that the west is not rushing to help 
but she said she was encouraged by moves toward independence by 
the neighboring baltic republics of latvia and estonia 
i cannot imagine that the west will simply look on while 
latvia and estonia have sanctions imposed against them while they 
are being suffocated she said 
also wednesday finnish president mauno koivisto in an address 
before the 354member parliamentary assembly of the council of 
europe urged the three baltic republics to negotiate with moscow 
for their independence 
citing finlands history of accomodation with the soviet union 
he suggested the baltic states offer moscow neutrality in return 
for independence 
our own experience tells us that with a great power neighbor 
one has to reach negotiated solutions that will stand the test of 
time koivisto said 
in 1948 moscow pressured finland into a friendship treaty 
guaranteeing finnish neutrality and precluding antisoviet policies 
in helsinki

the justice department on wednesday urged a 
court to make public the pleadings filed by suspected spy felix 
bloch in his fight against state department efforts to fire him 
the justice department said in a court filing that bloch had 
failed to demonstrate any reason why the court document his 
attorneys filed may 2 should not be placed in the public court file 
blochs attorneys are challenging the governments attempt to 
use information obtained from foreign counterintelligence 
surveillance as evidence against the suspended diplomat in state 
department administrative proceedings 
blochs lawyers contend that the surveillances were illegal the 
justice department has asked us district judge stanley s harris 
to declare that the information was legally obtained and therefore 
can be used against bloch in the termination hearing 
the justice department has not brought criminal charges against 
bloch whom law enforcement sources say is suspected of having 
passed secrets to the soviet union while he was posted in europe as 
a diplomat there have been reports that french agents videotaped 
him passing a briefcase to a kgb agent in paris 
the justice department disputed the argument by blochs lawyers 
that the may 2 pleadings should kept under seal because they 
contain sensitive information 
blochs memorandum contains no classified information and 
filing it on the public record of this case would not harm the 
national security nor impede the underlying administrative 
proceeding being conducted by the state department the justice 
petition argued 
blochs hearing was scheduled to begin this week but it has 
been postponed 
in a separate pleading the justice department reiterated its 
opposition to an attempt by blochs lawyers to obtain access to all 
the audio tapes and transcripts of the electronic surveillances 
blochs attorneys have received copies of the tapes and 
transcripts of the material the state department wants to use but 
the lawyers have asked harris to order the government to turn over 
all the surveillance information 
the fbi has filed an affidavit stating that further disclosures 
to bloch would endanger national security 
the justice department also rejected a suggestion by blochs 
attorneys that they could receive the material because they already 
have security clearances 
blochs lawyers had pledged not to disclose any of the material 
to their client but the justice department said this would place 
them in an untenable position 
blochs lawyers would have access to materials their client 
has not seen and cannot see the department said this fact 
would make it difficult or impossible for them to give proper 
advice to their client as mr bloch attempts to make informed 
decisions throughout the litigation the department said noting 
bloch might be confronted with the choice of whether or not to 
seek a settlement 
blochs lawyers then would have a conflict of interest in 
representing their client the department said

a federal judge wednesday sided with three 
states and ordered the army of corps of engineers to maintain water 
levels at a huge missouri river reservoir in order to protect the 
states fishing industry 
us district judge patrick conmys ruling regarding lake oahe 
prompted shippers to begin moving barges off the missouris 
730mile shipping channel to keep them from being marooned as the 
river falls 
the order will virtually halt navigation along the channel 
which runs from sioux city iowa to st louis said chet worm 
chief of the corps reservoir regulation branch in omaha neb 
officials warned that power shortages also could result 
the ruling was in response to a request by north dakota south 
dakota and montana 
those states governors said the order could help end disputes 
over management of the droughthit missouri at 2540 miles the 
longest river in the united states but spokesmen for govs terry 
branstad of iowa and kay orr of nebraska two states downstream 
criticized it 
the news is very alarming said orrs legal counsel bud 
cuca 
downstream states rely on the river for water for drinking 
cooling power plants and sustaining fish and wildlife populations 
of their own officials said 
conmy ordered the corps of engineers to maintain the reservoir 
at its current level until june 1 when the lakes walleyed pike 
hatch will have ended south dakota officials contend the hatch 
would have been destroyed had the corps been allowed to proceed 
with plans to lower the level by 3 feet this month 
lake oahe spans both dakotas and has a storage capacity of 233 
million acrefeet or enough water to put 233 million acres under 
1 foot of water 
the governors of montana and the dakotas contend the corps is 
sacrificing millions of dollars worth of recreation and fishing 
interests in their states to provide enough water for shipping 
the corps filed notice it would appeal conmys order us 
attorney steve easton said but south dakota gov george mickelson 
said the three states have already won 
even an expedited appeal is likely to take a few weeks 
mickelson said before it is decided we will have accomplished 
most of what we set out to do he said 
there is justice after all and this running battle has come 
to a temporary halt at least north dakota gov george sinner 
added the water will stop flowing away from us and we will stop 
being washed down the river 
attorneys for the corps argued the agency had balanced a number 
of disparate needs in deciding how to manage the flow of water from 
six upper missouri dams 
sinner mickelson and montana gov stan stephens said they 
intended no longterm harm to states along the lower missouri 
my intention is to get them to sit down with us and 
recognize the contemporary needs of all the states mickelson 
said 
governors of the missouri basin states plan to discuss the 
dispute next wednesday in des moines iowa following a meeting by 
the executive committee of the national governors association 
branstad said 
charles findlay a justice department attorney representing the 
corps said it may have to reduce the missouris flow through 
august due to conmys order to avoid harming two rare birds that 
nest near the river the piping plover and the interior least tern 
if that happens electricity shortages could crop up downstream 
said omaha public power district spokesman mark gautier 
barge owners worried wednesday that they might not be able to 
get their vessels off the river in time 
weve got five barges up above omaha right now said roger 
blaske coowner of blaske marine inc of alton ill 
depending on how fast the river falls the barges could be 
stranded blaske said i guess wed just hang them up on a stump 
somewhere and hope theyre there next fall he said 
missouri river marinas also could be put out of business as the 
river drops an expected three feet as a result of the decision 
said john ferrell a corps spokesman in omaha neb 
but sinner mickelson and other officials say upper basin states 
have suffered virtually all the impact of a lingering drought 
entering its third year in the upper great plains 
its the worst drought in this century and theres going to 
be losers said former south dakota gov william janklow the 
lead attorney in the three states lawsuit 
the point we make is there shouldnt be any winners janklow 
said we should all suffer together

republicans losing several votes on 
amendments abandoned efforts wednesday night to stall senate 
action on a bill loosening restrictions on political activities by 
government workers 
gop leader bob dole of kansas agreed to allow a vote late 
thursday on final passage of the wholesale revisions in the 1939 
hatch act which now forbids federal employees from participating 
actively in partisan politics 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine said the senate would 
then proceed to consideration friday of rival campaign finance 
bills in the hope of finding a bipartisan compromise by the end of 
next week 
mitchell however acknowledged tat a compromise will require 
some backroom negotiations with dole and others 
in the meatime he said democrats will try next week to pass a 
bill authorizing 300 million a year in emergency aid for 13 cities 
whose public health systems face collapse because of local aids 
epidemics 
the 13 cities are atlanta boston chicago dallas houston los 
angeles miami new york newark nj philadelphia san 
francisco washington and san juan puerto rico 
under the agreement on the bill to revise the hatch act 
republicans may offer nine more amendments including one by dole 
to continue the current restrictions on employees in intelligence 
agencies the justice department the internal revenue service and 
the federal election commission 
a similar amendment by dole was defeated 5146 tuesday 
earlier wednesday democrats overwhelmingly beat back a 
republican effort to make federal employee unions refund part of 
the dues paid by members who disgree with the organizations 
political stands or endorsements 
on a 6335 vote the senate rejected an amendment by sen mitch 
mcconnell rky to force the dues rebates as part of a bill 
loosening restrictions on political activities by 3 million 
government civil service and postal workers 
mcconnell said his amendment would remove for federal workers 
the hobsons choice of having to pick between getting out of a 
union and losing their voice in collective bargaining or accepting 
the use of a portion of their dues for political causes they dont 
support 
a similar measure is one of the main features of the gops 
version of a campaign finance reform bill introduced wednesday in 
the senate 
both seek to write into law and expand a 1988 supreme court 
decision that workers who pay fees to labor organizations under 
union shop agreements can demand a rebate of any portion of those 
fees not devoted to collective bargaining 
the bill already approved in a broader form by the house would 
lift most of the current offthejob restrictions on political 
activities by government workers under the 51yearold hatch act 
also defeated on a 6236 vote was an amendment by dole to let 
workers in each federal agency decide by majority vote whether to 
accept a loosening of the rules on their outside political 
activites 
the senate spent more than a week on the legislation with 
majority democrats joined by about a dozen republicans rejecting a 
series of amendments by the gop leadership to maintain the 
restrictions 
president bushs senior advisers have said they would urge him 
to veto any change in the law as undermining the integrity and 
independence of the traditionally nonpartisan civil service 
george gould a lobbyist for the national association of letter 
carriers said wednesday the stream of amendments is an attempt by 
gop leaders to slow the process to give the white house time to 
try to peel away votes 
senate gop whip alan simpson admitted republicans lack the 40 
votes needed to maintain a filibuster against the bill he said the 
real test will come later when the white house asks republican 
leaders to scrape together the 34 votes needed to sustain a veto by 
bush 
the house passed the bill by a vetoproof 29790 majority in 
april 1989 with the support of 17 senate republicans democrats 
in a test vote last week mustered a 7028 majority also 
sufficient for overriding a veto over the gop leaderships 
opposition to bring the bill to the senate floor 
the unionsought legislation would lift current restrictions 
that prohibit federal workers from attending state and national 
political conventions as delegates or holding other party office 
the house version also would allow them to run for public office 
and solicit campaign funds from the public acts that would 
continue to be prohibited under the senate bill 
mcconnells amendment would have required federal employee 
unions to mail out notices annually to all 3 million government 
employees whether members of a union or not the notices would 
have to say that union members are entitled to a dues reduction 
equal to a prorata share of what the organization spends on 
political activities

the kgb may have played a role in 
the peaceful revolution by influencing czechoslovak security 
forces the state news agency ctk said wednesday 
the agency cited the sketchy findings of a parliamentary 
commission investigating the nov 17 attack on protesting students 
an event that sparked the swift popular revolt against more than 
four decades of communist rule 
according to ctk the commission said it had been unable despite 
six months of work to form a clear picture of events 
the key to understanding the events of november 17 is 
especially in the obviously illogical inactivity of the ministry of 
interior in the days that followed november 17 the commission 
reported according to ctk 
state security did virtually nothing although it had precise 
reports on what was happening the report continued as quoted by 
ctk it hinted without specifics that some kind of a second 
center existed inside the security forces and directed events 
the report said the commission was so far unable to to expose 
all culprits identify the second center those who directed the 
events and give the public a satisfactory explanation 
the report said lt gen antonin lorenz considered a key figure 
in the interior ministry had dinner nov 17 with a man it 
identified only as groshko a deputy chairman of the kgb and chief 
of its counterintelligence 
a kgb official reached by telephone in moscow said wednesday the 
organization has a deputy chairman named viktor grushko 
the report said lorenz made some 20 phone calls during the 
90minute meal 
it said lorenz visited moscow in august and september where he 
held talks with kgb chairman vladimir kryuchkov and both his first 
deputies but it stressed the content of the talks was not known 
months before the uprising rumors circulated in prague hinting 
that soviet president mikhail s gorbachev was dissatisfied with 
the rigid prague regime and pressing for more democratic change 
two days after the nov 17 beatings dissidents established the 
civic forum movement that eventually guided the revolution strikes 
and street protests spread around the country by nov 20 
unhindered by police 
police allowed the dissidents otherwise detained on every 
significant anniversary to establish in peace and quiet the civic 
forum and overthrow the regime the report said 
by nov 24 the orthodox chief of the communist party milos 
jakes and his politburo allies had been ousted 
lorenz is currently in custody pending investigation of charges 
that he abused the power of a public official 
miroslav stepan a former prague communist party boss is also 
in custody pending results of a similar investigation 
stepan and jakes have denied they ordered the attack nov 17 
if found guilty stepan and lorenz could spend up to 10 years 
imprisonment

the small claims agreement 
announced wednesday opens the way for settling about 16 billion in 
claims that have been a major financial irritant between iran and 
the united states for 10 years both nations agree 
an american official and an iranian official at the iranunited 
states claims tribunal in the hague told the associated press the 
settlement will speed resolution of the big cases 
settlement of the major cases could help reestablish economic 
relations between the two nations the american official said 
the iranian official denied however that better usiran 
economic ties would result 
the economic relationship depends on the political 
relationship he said if you dont have a good relationship in 
the political sector how can you have a good relationship in the 
economic sector 
both officials spoke on condition of anonymity 
governmenttogovernment talks are expected to begin soon on 
settlement of the foreign military sales or fms claim by iran 
which the tehran government has put at about 11 billion 
the largest case before the tribunal it deals with military 
supplies ordered by shah mohammad reza pahlavi before his overthrow 
in the 1979 islamic revolution 
washington disputes tehrans figure as exaggerated claiming 
that while some of the materiel is under us embargo much of it 
was never paid for and is being held by us contractors 
the american official said once small claims are settled the 
tribunal will have more time for military equipment and oil claims 
the ninejudge arbitration panel was established as part of the 
1980 algiers accords which gained freedom for the 52 americans 
held hostage at the us embassy in tehran by iranian militants 
the tribunal has presided over the settlement of more than 22 
billion in financial disputes stemming from the iranian revolution 
resulting expropriations and broken contracts 
the oil expropriation claims filed by the american oil giants 
amoco arco and sun and by consortiums of smaller firms total 
about 5 billion 
a key to their irans economic recovery is settling all of 
them the american official said 
settlement of these cases particularly if they entailed a 
softening of us import restrictions on iranian oil would reflect 
and accelerate a thawing 
a reopening of the us oil market to iran is considered vital 
to the iranians who depend on oil exports for about 90 percent of 
their foreign exchange earnings 
theyre desperate for hard currency said the american 
official 
the small claims talks have been held almost monthly between the 
state departments chief legal adviser judge abraham sofaer and 
irans jaromi eftekhar 
sofaer is due to resign from his state department position next 
month and the american tribunal official said sofaer is expected to 
begin settlement talks before then with iran on the fms claim 
known as b1 
without the small claims the tribunal will have more 
resources to devote to b1 and the oil claims said the american 
a more speculative question is whether resolution of the 
military equipment and oil cases could provide the goodwill gesture 
sought by tehran in response to the recent release of american 
hostages robert polhill and frank reed who were held by 
proiranian shiite moslem militants in lebanon 
the american official and iran have denied any link between 
agreement on small claims and the release 
resolution of the fms and oil cases would allow the tribunal to 
shut down after almost a decade as the only official forum between 
iran and the united states which broke off diplomatic relations 
following the 1979 hostagetaking 
if we do all the things necessary to close it down doors will 
have been opened in the process said the american tribunal 
official 
it would result in improved good will

us officials allowed american 
troops to leave their bases wednesday for the first time since the 
weekend slaying of a marine and us diplomats began changing 
license plates to prevent identification by insurgents 
also wednesday prosecutors ordered police to release three 
suspects in the killing of gunnery sgt john fredette 34 saying 
the arrests were flawed and evidence linking the men to the slaying 
was insufficient 
police have refused to obey the court order pending approval 
from the chief of police and the mayor officials said 
assistant prosecutor dorentino floresca said his ruling does not 
absolve the three in the slaying of fredette but added that 
evidence presented by the police against them is not convincing 
he ordered police to submit additional evidence against the 
suspects within five working days 
on tuesday police lt col macarthur torres said renato 
angeles 38 a former subic base worker confessed to having 
accidentally killed fredette in a robbery attempt but on wednesday

philippines banned offpost leaves saturday after fredette was 
murdered near the subic bay naval base 50 miles west of manila

one legacy of the exxon valdez disaster 
has been several spill bills to strengthen alaskas pollution 
laws but two tough antispill measures have run aground on 
legislative shoals 
gov steve cowper said wednesday he was pleased with the bills 
that passed before tuesday nights adjournment deadline but he 
said the oil industry had played a major role in preventing 
stronger bills from passing 
they weakened the legislation that passed and they probably 
were instrumental in stopping the bills that didnt get through 
cowper said 
the democraticcontrolled house sent six oilspill bills to the 
republicanled senate which killed a major enforcement bill house 
republicans meanwhile stopped the only senatepassed bill in 
their chamber 
in addition some provisions on bills that passed were weakened 
by the legislature cowper said 
nonetheless he said state industry and federal government 
measures since the spill will help prevent another disaster like 
the exxon valdez the worst oil spill in the nations history 
the tanker struck a charted reef on march 24 1989 and spilled 
nearly 11 million gallons of north slope crude in the hitherto 
pristine waters of prince william sound 
walt parker chairman of the alaska oil spill commission which 
investigated the exxon valdez disaster said the oil industrys 
massive lobbying presence against the bills was understandable 
it is their no 1 priority to have no state involvement in the 
oil transportation system parker said 
a house bill that would set strict standards for oilindustry 
cleanup plans including a 72hour requirement for response to 
major spills had to wait until the final hours of the session 
before winning senate approval 
its not a performance standard its a planning standard 
said dennis kelso commissioner of the state department of 
environmental conservation 
the measure also requires companies either to prove they can pay 
spill cleanup costs or risk a state shutdown of their operations 
although revamped in senate committee the bill is still worth 
having kelso said 
a tough enforcement and inspection bill died in the senate 
resources committee when the session adjourned 
the original bill would have let the department of environmental 
conservation order companies to pay for independent audits of 
pollution problems the senate version said companies could refuse 
the states request 
the senate judiciary panel removed a provision allowing 
warrantless searches of suspected polluters replacing it with a 
plan allowing such searches only if agreed on as part of the 
companys operating permit 
the bill also was changed to give companies more time to obey 
state compliance orders for correcting violations of environmental 
laws 
house republicans blocked passage of a senate bill that would 
have increased municipal access to the states oilspill fund 
which is financed by a 5centabarrel tax on alaska oil production 
the new tax was instituted last year as an immediate response to 
the tanker accident and the bill would have increased municipal 
access to the fund for cleanup and other emergency costs 
other bills that won legislative approval and were sent to the 
governor include measures that would 
increase criminal penalties for negligent operation of oil 
tankers 
establish a citizens oversight council on oil and other 
hazardous substances 
establish state management plans for oilspill response 
efforts 
increase corporate fines for negligence in oil spills and 
other crimes

an investigating team from antigua questioned 
israeli reserve col yair klein about a shipment of israeli arms to 
the caribbean island that instead was diverted to a colombian drug 
lord kleins attorney said wednesday 
attorney yigal shapiro said the four antiguan investigators 
spent hours over inner talking with klein and added it was 
unlikely he would be questioned further 
from our point of view the answers given by the government of 
israel clear us and i dont think it is necessary to meet 
again he said 
the antiguans headed by the un diplomat patrick lewis were 
given a file of 53 documents by foreign ministry officials on 
tuesday 
the file included an enduser certificate bearing the signature 
of vere bird jr antiguas top defense official assuring israel 
the arms would be used exclusively by the islands military and not 
sent on to a third country 
a ministry official demanding anonymity said the israelis 
asked the antiguans some hard questions on how the enduse 
agreement was violated 
the delegation is also expected to meet with the captain of the 
ship that carried the weapons to antigua and a military officer who 
accompanied the arms 
shapiro said klein had no information on how the arms got to 
colombia and that the antiguans gave no sign they planned to take 
legal steps against klein 
the new york times identified klein and maurice sarfati an 
israeli who was a businessman in antigua as the men responsible 
for the arms diversion 
colombian officials said klein is wanted for organizing 
training and equipping paramilitary groups 
klein said earlier the weapons were paid for by panamanian 
exiles and intended for a military training camp set up in antigua 
for panamanian rebels opposed to manuel noriega the countrys de 
facto leader now deposed and awaiting trial on drug charges in 
florida 
after plans for the camp fell through klein said the 
panamanians wanted the arms shipped to panama but they wound up in 
the hands of gonzalo rodriguez gacha a drug boss killed by 
colombian police last december 
israel television said sarfati acting as special envoy for 
antigua came to israel and arranged for a ship from ashdod to 
carry a 10ton container marked dangerous material which 
contained israelimade weapons and rockets 
the vessel sailed for antigua under a panamanian flag the cargo 
was supposed to be transferred to a ship named sea point which was 
bound for panama but instead continued on to colombia the tv said 
the tv said the antiguans planned to meet the captain 
the jerusalem post identified the ship as the else ph owned by 
svendbog enterprises of denmark and said it sailed from haifa on 
march 28 1989 bound for chile it arrived in antigua on april 24

a judge who once granted chippewa indians 
100 percent of the fish caught in northern wisconsin ruled 
wednesday that the regions harvestable natural resources 
should be divided 5050 between indians and nonindians 
us district judge barbara crabbs decision which came in a 
case that set parameters for deer hunting has sweeping 
implications that limit the tribes right to half the available 
fish and timber in northern wisconsin lawyers said 
under treaties that ceded the northern third of the state to the 
united states in the 19th century wisconsins six chippewa bands 
retain the right to spearfish hunt and cut timber offreservation 
on public lands in the region 
since a court affirmed the treaties in 1983 the chippewa have 
exercised their spearfishing rights on northern lakes encountering 
huge and sometimes violent protests by opponents who claim the 
special treaty rights are unfair and threaten to deplete fish and 
timber resources 
wednesdays decision contrasts with mrs crabbs previous ruling 
that the chippewa are entitled to 100 percent of the safe 
allowable catch of fish in the 23929 square miles of territory 
ceded in the 19th century 
state lawyers said the new ruling essentially alters the 
previous decision 
its our understanding of this decision that it does not apply 
only to deer but that it applies to all natural resources 
attorney general donald hanaway said and i think thats 
extremely significant 
mrs crabbs office said the judge would not further interpret 
her intentions beyond what was stated in her 74page decision 
since the 1983 court ruling the chippewa bands have filed a 
series of lawsuits asking the court to define how much of the 
resources of northern wisconsin they are entitled to under the 
treaties and to what degree the state can regulate tribal 
activities 
tribal attorneys declined immediate comment on the ruling but 
tom maulson a lac du flambeau chippewa spearfishing coordinator 
and a leader in the treaty rights group waswagon treaty 
association said the philosophy of sharing the resource has been 
supported by the tribe for years 
maulson said the split in allocation of resources did not 
unfairly deprive the chippewa of their rights 
i bet the tribe will never touch 50 percent he said we 
say the resource is for everybody maybe theyll start to realize 
that what weve wanted all along 
administration secretary james klauser the top aide to gov 
tommy g thompson said wednesdays ruling was significant because 
it recognizes the nonindian right to the resources 
the important findings are that the treaty provisions only 
apply to public lands and the state has regulatory authority for 
the hunting seasons he added 
the leader of an antitreaty group said the latest ruling 
wouldnt anger nonindians and could lead to a solution to tensions 
over tribal rights 
i think shes beginning to open the door to cooperation to 
open the door for settlement between all parties said larry 
peterson of the protect americans rights and resources 
the judge said she was setting the deer limit for the chippewa 
at 50 percent of the estimated population based on the tribes 
needs for a moderate standard of living and to prevent the 
frustration of the nonindian treaty right

the socialist government narrowly defeated a 
noconfidence motion introduced after a politician was granted 
amnesty under a widely unpopular law that had been sponsored by the 
governing party 
only 262 deputies voted for the motion 27 short of the majority 
needed in the 577seat national assembly 
if the motion had succeeded premier michel rocards government 
would have been forced to resign leaving president francois 
mitterrand to name a new prime minister or call legislative 
elections 
it was the fifth failed noconfidence motion since mitterrand 
was reelected in 1988 
the assembly passed the socialistproposed amnesty bill in 
december with all communist deputies and many rightists voting 
against it 
the amnesty came as politicians and newspapers began reporting 
that kickbacks on public contracts had become a major source of 
funding for nearly all the established parties 
the opposition says it understood the amnesty law would protect 
contributors but exclude members of the assembly 
they claim the government misrepresented the bill and were 
especially angered when former cooperation minister christian nucci 
received amnesty in the financial scandal 
the amnesty has contributed to mitterrands decline in public 
opinion polls only 39 percent of french citizens expressing 
approval with his performance in a recent newspaper survey

the navys decision to let two gay rotc cadets 
keep their scholarships could signal hope that a pentagon policy 
barring homosexuals from the armed services might one day be 
abolished activists said wednesday 
i think the military realizes that it needs to change and is 
fully working towards it said discharged cadet robert bettiker 
a chemistry major at the massachusetts institute of technology 
the navy had ordered bettiker and all other rotc cadets who are 
homosexuals to reimburse the government for all tuition payments 
but this week bettiker and another discharged cadet harvard 
university graduate david carney received letters from the navy 
exempting them from the tuition demand the navy had been seeking 
38612 in tuition from bettiker and 50687 from carney 
im not exactly sure what it all means bettiker said my 
lawyer and i will talk and see how this will help other people im 
willing to do my part 
bettiker 22 had wanted to enter the navys nuclear propulsion 
program but has instead decided to work at a cancer research 
laboratory at the university of california berkeley after 
graduation 
carney 23 is working toward a masters degree in management at 
templeton college in oxford england while in the reserve corps 
he was working toward a submarine assignment as a nuclear engineer 
navy lt greg smith said there was no real information 
provided about the navys aboutface but said the decision was 
related only to the cambridge students cases 
the decision was handed down on a personal review of the cases 
that were involved and the navy elected in these instances to not 
require them to repay the money smith said in a telephone 
interview from washington dc 
smith said bettiker and carney were so far the only two former 
cadets to receive such a dispensation he said the decision would 
not exempt them from the broader pentagon policy barring 
homosexuals from rotc and military service 
rep gerry studds dmass who is gay complained in a letter 
to navy secretary h lawrence garrett iii that he had learned of a 
third homosexual naval rotc cadet from whom the navy was seeking 
repayment 
studds released his letter but declined to identify the cadet 
must i look forward to hearing from midshipman after 
midshipman who has been ordered to repay funds which as the navy 
acknowledged with regard to carney and bettiker he should not be 
required to pay studds wrote 
the defense department issued a statement in march saying it 
views homosexuality as incompatible with military service for 
reasons of morale discipline and security 
carney said that while he disagrees with the policy he harbored 
no animosity about being rejected from the rotc 
i dont like the fact that an institution in our american 
society had this particular policy but that policy does not make 
the navy an institution filled with evil people carney said in a 
telephone interview from england 
mary bonauto bettikers lawyer welcomed the navys decision 
but said she was looking at it as a crack in a very large wall 
they havent changed their policy they simply made an 
exemption she said 
james holobaugh a former army rotc member at washington 
university in st louis was awaiting word on a similar appeal 
holobaugh 24 was due to receive his army commission last may 
but after informing his superiors that he had come to the 
realization that he was gay an army professor recommended the 
cadet be denied commission and be ordered to pay back 25000 in 
scholarship money 
i think its nice that the navy admitted that its wrong for 
going after the money said holobaugh who is enrolled at the 
university of new haven in connecticut but the money is not the 
issue here 
army spokesman maj joseph l allred said the army would 
consider appeals on a casebycase basis and would not be swayed by 
the navys recent decisions regarding bettiker and carney

the rainbloated arkansas river reached 
its highest level in 37 years wednesday in flooding that put more 
than 500 homes under water and has drowned or trapped hundreds of 
cattle officials said 
the river began slowly receding after cresting wednesday morning 
at 475 feet at pine bluff about 40 miles southeast of little rock 
the highest its been since reaching 521 feet in 1943 the 
national weather service said 
floods that swamped texas and oklahoma as well as arkansas began 
late last week following heavy rains rains and flooding have 
claimed 12 lives in texas and one in oklahoma but none in 
arkansas officials said 
in texas where 4000 homes have been damaged or destroyed by 
flooding up to 400 volunteers national guard soldiers and 
officials patrolled levees near the arkansas line that threatened 
to give way on the swollen red river 
residents of flooded sections of dallas tried to save what they 
could from homes under several feet of water others began cleaning 
up 
several hundred homes were flooded in oklahoma but the waters 
are starting to go down said civil defense spokesman richard 
hill theres still a lot of places we cant physically reach 
in arkansas about 300 homes in jefferson county which includes 
pine bluff were flooded wednesday and more than 200 homes were 
underwater along the river from that county to fort smith on the 
oklahoma line authorities said about 16000 sandbags were sent to 
jefferson county 
officials say its difficult to estimate the number of people 
evacuated because most are staying with friends or relatives 
rather than at emergency shelters 
about 400 cattle were missing from herds along the river basin 
and were believed to have drowned said arkansas cattlemens 
association president walt rowden 
officials continue to watch the weather said army corps of 
engineers spokesman ron helton 
our biggest concern now is rain helton said our 
lakes are full and they cant handle any more water so it will 
have to come down river 
the white house may declare arkansas a federal disaster area 
later this week state and federal officials said at a news 
conference at little rocks riverfront park as the river rolled by 
at 440000 cubic feet per second 
people could begin receiving federal assistance as early as 
monday if the declaration is signed before the weekend said joe 
brady operations supervisor for the state office of emergency 
services 
no firm estimates on damage were available officials said 
brady estimated damage to roads and bridges at about 10 million 
but said that figure is expected to escalate 
theres no way to get precise counts until the water 
recedes he said 
the floods have caused millions of dollars worth of damage to 
farmers in jefferson county alone the flooding is expected to 
cause an estimated 20 million in damages including reduced rice 
and cotton crops said frank plafcan of the county extension office 
direct losses to cattle ranchers across the river basin are 
expected to top 250000 and expected higher feed costs due to hay 
and alfalfa crops now underwater will add to ranchers woes rowden 
said 
bradley harris regional director for the federal emergency 
management agency said he expects state emergency officials 
assisted by fema personnel to complete preliminary damage surveys 
by thursday or friday that information will be forwarded to the 
white house 
in another development corps officials continued to discount 
complaints the flooding was worse because of mismanagement along 
the mcclellankerr arkansas river navigation system 
buddy dyke of swan lake where about 35 families have been 
forced to leave their homes complained about misinformation from 
the corps 
they said it was going to crest on monday then tuesday then 
wednesday then in pine bluff on thursday said buddy dyke of 
swan lake where about 35 families have been forced to leave their 
homes itll probably be here on friday 
he said the river rose several feet higher than residents were 
told to expect cut off from land they didnt have time to move 
out valuables 
col charles mccloskey with the little rock district of the army 
engineers said in little rock that water would have been higher in 
most places without the navigation system and said the system 
worked like it was supposed to 
pj spaul another corps spokesman said earlier this week that 
flood damage would have been three to four times greater without 
the levee system the reservoir system in oklahoma prevented 
another 105 million in damages in arkansas he said 
among those with trapped cattle was state rep lloyd george of 
danville who has about 150 head stranded on 40 dry acres on a 
2000acre pasture 
obviously thats not enough for them to feed on said 
george whos paying 100 a day to feed cattle that otherwise would 
graze 
im concerned about these cattle he said if i have to 
keep feeding them it gets expensive

sen richard lugar and rep henry hyde said 
wednesday they have no recollection of discussions about assisting 
the contras which turned up in newly released portions of oliver 
norths notebooks 
in a march 4 1985 meeting about the contras hyde rill 
brought up private efforts 3rd countries taiwan saudi 
arabia according to an entry on one of 1400 pages of norths 
notebooks 
in 1985 during a us military aid ban to the contras saudi 
arabia was providing them with 1 million a month taiwan 
contributed 1 million to the rebel force in mid1985 
hyde says he didnt know anything about the saudi contributions 
at the time assuming norths notes are correct hyde said he 
probably suggested taiwan and saudi arabia as possible donors 
because they were anticommunist 
norths notes say the comments came in a meeting about the 
contras between national security adviser robert mcfarlane and four 
congressmen mcfarlane had arranged the saudi contributions in 1984 
hyde a staunch backer of the reagan administration in the 
irancontra affair said i may have suggested thirdcountry 
contributions on other occasions but had no inkling that they 
were actually occurring until the congressional hearings into the 
irancontra affair 
lugar rind was told by contra leader adolfo calero and 
national security adviser john poindexter about ilopango air base 
a key link in the contra resupply operation according to norths 
notebook 
calerojmp both told lugar that ilopango was active says 
a jan 9 1986 entry 
lugar has no recollection of being told such information 
said his press secretary david shapiro lugar has said he was 
unaware in 1985 and 1986 of the arming of the contras in 
contravention of the boland amendment restrictions 
meanwhile the white house declined to make any substantive 
comment about a newly disclosed entry suggesting north met with 
president bush on aug 6 1986 the day the vice president returned 
from a trip to the middle east 
the apparent northbush meeting occurred a few hours after the 
white house aide lied to the house intelligence committee by 
denying he was offering military advice to the contras in 
connection with iran north received a call that day from amiram 
nir the main israeli contact regarding arms sales to iran three 
days earlier 240 spare parts for hawk missiles had been delivered 
to iran 
bush has said he didnt learn the full details of the iran 
initiative until dec 20 1986 but on july 29 1986 during his 
mideast trip he met with nir in jerusalem and was briefed on it 
bush chief of staff craig fuller took notes saying that we are 
dealing with the most radical elements in iran 
the various committees both congressional and independent 
counsel have looked at all these matters and we dont have 
anything to add beyond that said white house spokesman roman 
popadiuk 
rep lee hamilton dind suggested tuesday that the page of 
norths notebooks pointing to a meeting with bush apparently wasnt 
turned over to congress 
i dont know which parts were or were not made available to 
the congress said the white house spokesman but i know that 
basically the independent counsel and the congressional 
investigating committees have been provided all kinds of material 
including norths materials so we will not comment on it 
norths other notebook entries for the morning of aug 6 1986 
referred to conversations with others in the us government 
including elliott abrams then assistant secretary of state for 
interamerican affairs and col james steele a us military 
adviser in el salvador as well as thenassociated press washington 
bureau chief charles j lewis 
terry anderson the aps chief middle east correspondent is one 
of the us hostages north directed the reagan administrations 
efforts to win release of hostages by selling arms to iran and was 
the national security council staff member in charge of hostage 
matters 
north also met about a month later with ap president louis d 
boccardi to discuss andersons situation according to notes 
supplied to a special presidential commission that investigated the 
irancontra affair

a jury wednesday found a man guilty of 
trying to poison the historic treaty oak a centuriesold tree that 
was severely damaged by the powerful herbicide velpar 
paul stedman cullen 46 faces a possible life sentence because 
of a prior conviction he has been jailed since his arrest in june 
1989 state district judge bob perkins scheduled the sentencing 
phase of the trial for thursday 
cullen stood expressionless as the verdict was read after about 
three and onehalf hours of deliberation he refused to comment as 
he was led from the courtroom 
prosecutors contended that cullen used the powerful herbicide 
velpar to poison the centuriesold live oak tree in a ritual 
apparently designed to end his affection for his counselor at a 
methadone clinic 
legend has it that the giant live oak estimated to be at least 
500 years old was the site of a treaty signing between stephen f 
austin and indians during the 1820s 
prosecutors during the 1week trial produced a tape recording 
in which cullen told cindy blaco he had killed the tree adding 
the only evidence is my mouth 
cullens defense lawyers said cullen was lying to try to impress 
ms blaco who secretly taped the conversation for police 
they contended that ms blaco may have been testifying to 
collect more than 11000 in rewards the defense also called 
witnesses who said cullen wasnt interested in the occult but was 
prone to telling outrageous lies 
ms blaco testified that during february 1989 when experts 
believe the tree was poisoned cullen had several books on 
witchcraft and the occult she also testified that she saw two 
containers of velpar in the back of cullens truck that month 
since the poisoning was discovered last memorial day more than 
100000 has been donated as city foresters and outside experts 
have taken extraordinary measures to save the tree 
velparcontaminated earth was removed from around its roots the 
tree has been doused with spring water and shaded by elaborate sun 
screens but foresters say at least half the oak is dead 
news reports about the trees plight have brought visitors and 
getwell messages from around the world

pope john paul ii speaking to an 
audience of mexicos wealthiest businessmen assailed the idea that 
capitalism has beaten socialism and said wednesday that mexico is 
still very far from the ideal of justice 
he said the poor had suffered the worst consequences of mexicos 
economic crisis and accused the small powerful upperclass of 
generating even more poverty 
the events of recent history have been interpreted 
sometimes in a superficial way as the triumph of the liberal 
capitalist system john paul said in a speech in durango a 
provincial capital 450 miles northwest of mexico city 
some interests would like to take the analysis to the extreme 
of presenting the system they consider the winner as the only way 
for our world but he said that conclusion avoids the necessary 
critical judgment about the effects that liberal capitalism has 
produced in the socalled third world countries 
on the fourth day of his trip here the pope earlier wednesday 
visited a state prison and spent 20 minutes greeting and blessing 
inmates including murderers and drug traffickers 
wednesday evening the pope ordained 100 new priests during a 
mass in a local plaza attended by 200000 people the novices 
prostrated themselves as the pope prayed then knelt before john 
paul one by one as he placed his hands on their shoulders to 
indicate the transmission of the spirit of god 
his message to latin americas business people also appeared 
aimed at us officials and intellectuals who have pushed the idea 
that western capitalism beat communism with the upheaval in eastern 
europe 
it was the polishborn pontiffs strongest warning yet not to 
gloat over communisms decline and not to ignore the problems of 
materialism and poverty 
john paul used the economic situation in this nation of 85 
million people as an example of the failings of capitalism 
the last few years have seen the deterioration of buying 
power and phenomena typical of the organization of the economy 
such as inflation have produced painful effects at all levels 
he said 
it is necessary to repeat once again it is always the weakest 
who suffer the worst consequences because they see themselves 
closed in a spiral of growing poverty 
mexicos economic crisis exploded in 1982 due to overborrowing 
and plunging prices for crude oil the countrys main export the 
average mexicans buying power was cut in half between 1982 and 
1988 
mexico despite the inherent resources that the creator gave 
this country is still very far from the ideal of justice the 
pope said before noting the vast contrast between the rich few and 
the poor majority 
he said foreign creditors were not the only cause of mexicos 
economic problems 
the pontiff said that by taking too big a share of the countrys 
resources the very wealthy accumulated a wealth that is a 
generator of poverty for others 
john paul asked business leaders in overwhelmingly roman 
catholic mexico to create more jobs pay proper salaries and 
protect the environment 
he said the economic interests of capitalism often fomented

a vietnamese refugee was 
sentenced tuesday to 21 months in prison for negligence in the 
drownings of two malaysian women he was attempting to smuggle 
across the niagara river into the united states 
ba minh hoang 28 of niagara falls ontario was transporting 
the women across the river aboard a flimsy raft in december 1988 
when it capsized in icy turbulent water 
hoang swam to shore but vasugee krighan 27 and fong yew cheah 
38 drowned both women were illegal immigrants 
hoang pleaded guilty in april to two charges of criminal 
negligence in the deaths and to charges of conspiracy to violate 
us immigration laws 
he was sentenced tuesday by provincial court judge harry 
edmondstone to 21 months for each charge of criminal negligence 
and 12 months for conspiracy the sentences are to be served 
concurrently 
hoang was paid for his part in the smuggling operation but the 
amount was not disclosed in court

swimming pool than the currents and whirlpools of the lower 
niagara river 
defense attorney larry obrien argued that his clients motive 
was a belief he was helping refugees better their lives

the guidedmissile destroyer uss conyngham 
limped back to port under tow tuesday after a boiler fire spread to 
its nerve center killing the ships operation officer and injuring 
12 others officials said 
in a second fatal navy accident tuesday a crew member aboard an 
aircushioned landing vessel off the east coast was killed when a 
propeller malfunctioned it was the latest accident since a series 
of problems forced a worldwide navy standdown last fall 
the fire on the 27yearold conyngham started around 530 am 
while it was on routine operations about 100 miles southeast of 
norfolk where it is based said lt cmdr carrie hartshorne a 
spokeswoman for the us atlantic fleet 
the blaze broke out in the no 1 boiler room when the boiler was 
fired up according to white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
the fire spread to the combat information center spaces which 
caused the captain to evacuate the combat information center and 
the bridge temporarily leaving the ship without communications and 
dead in the water fitzwater said 
the combat information center contains all of the ships 
communications equipment plus sonar and radar and is considered the 
ships nerve center 
the norfolkbased ship whose skipper is cmdr wr williams 
has a crew of 383 
the main fire was put out after about 2 hours and the crew 
battled smaller secondary fires through the morning 
atlantic fleet officials said the conyngham was able to move 
under its own power en route to norfolk at about 3 mph until 
midday when it lost power about 60 miles east of norfolk it was 
then taken under tow by the salvage ship uss opportune 
navy officials were unable to say when the conyngham would reach 
its homeport 
the guidedmissile cruiser uss normandy the briscoe and coast 
guard cutters point arena gentian and forward also assisted the 
conyngham said capt paul hanley a spokesman for the fleet 
the navy identified the dead man as lt algernon pope gordon 
jr 34 of montgomery ala a spokeswoman for the us bankruptcy 
cort in montgomery said the victim was the son of a us bankruptcy 
judge there the spokeswoman who asked not to be identified said 
gordon was married with three children 
gordon was assigned to the conyngham in july 1989 and was the 
ships operations officer said mike lewis a spokesman for rep 
bill dickinson of alabama the ranking republican on the house 
armed services committee 
lewis said gordon had joined the navy after graduating from the 
university of alabama and worked as a recruiting officer in 
montgomery from 198486 
the 12 injured sailors were flown by helicopter to hospitals 
three sailors initially taken to sentara norfolk general 
hospital trauma unit were transferred to the portsmouth naval 
hospital to join the others three were in guarded condition and 
the rest listed as satisfactory the navy said the navy said nine 
had burns and three suffered smoke inhalation 
the navy identified the injured as lt cmdr martin moody of 
indian head md the ships executive officer lt jg oscar 
dansby of atlanta lt jg john beaver of falls church va petty 
officer 1st class joseph sanchez of seguin texas petty officer 
1st class timothy mccauley of thomasville nc petty officer 3rd

albuquerque new mexico seaman daniel bartolo of ozone park ny 
seaman james choss of hammond lake ind and seaman edward gardner 
of scott city mo 
dansby beaver and repik were in guarded condition the navy 
said 
the 437foot ship was commissioned in 1963 it is armed with 
harpoon antiship missiles and standard antiaircraft missiles as 
well as torpedoes depth charges and two 5inch guns it can reach 
speeds of 30 knots and can fire up to six missiles a minute 
the navy as is its practice refused to say whether the 
conyngham was carrying nuclear weapons according to janes 
fighting ships the conyngham has the capability of firing nuclear 
depth charges and torpedoes 
pentagon spokesman bob hall said he ship was scheduled to be 
decommissioned in june 1991 he declined to say if it might be 
decommissioned sooner because of the damage 
in may 1987 the conyngham helped rescue the uss stark after it 
was hit by missiles from an iraqi jet in the persian gulf sixty of 
the conynghams crew members were decorated for valor for their 
actions in fighting the fire aboard the stark and evacuating the 
wounded and dead the conyngham later towed the disabled stark to 
port 
in 1988 an irish stowaway was discovered aboard the ship as it 
made its way back from ireland the teenage girl was found in a 
2footby15foot passageway where she had hidden for 10 days 
four crew members were courtmartialed 
the second navy accident occurred tuesday afternoon aboard an 
aircushion vehicle near the chesapeake bay bridge from virginia 
beach to the eastern shore said chief petty officer bob gimblet of 
the atlantic fleet 
gimblet said he did not know whether the propeller itself or 
other debris struck and killed the crew member who was not 
identified pending notification of relatives 
the flatshaped boat which travels on a cushion of air 
generated by huge fans or propellers has a crew of five and is 
used for carrying troops and equipment into battle the vessel was 
assigned to assault craft unit 4 based at the little creek naval 
amphibious base in norfolk the navy said 
last fall a series of accidents around the world in which 14 
people died prompted the navy to order an unprecedented twoday 
standdown to review safety procedures 
in addition to fires aircraft crashes and sailors being swept 
overboard a shell fired by the cargo ship el paso during an 
exercise in the atlantic struck the helicopter carrier iwo jima 
killing one person and injuring another and the pilot of an attack 
jet accidentally dropped a 500pound bomb on the cruiser uss reeves 
in the indian ocean slightly injuring five sailors

congressional democrats are worried that the 
public will blame them for any tax increases that emerge from talks 
with president bush over the worsening federal deficit 
i think we should hear straight from the president where he 
stands on taxes rep richard durbin dill said tuesday as the 
administration outlined the need for up to 100 million in 
deficitfighting actions the president hasnt said what his plan 
is and we shouldnt lead with our chin on this issue 
leaders of both parties in the house and senate were meeting 
again with bush at the white house today to discuss the widening 
fiscal 1991 budget gap caused partly by a weakerthanexpected 
economy and the rising cost of bailing out failed savings and loans 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater refused tuesday to rule 
out a boost in income taxes but some republican senators 
including bob packwood of oregon said they believed bush would not 
seriously consider that option

burger king walmart kinney shoes dunkin 
donuts are hardly names that stir feelings of fear and loathing in 
the masses 
but for joseph and lorrie liani the owners of a quaint doughnut 
shop down the road from salem state college the names are like a 
punch in the stomach its the feeling that strikes any momandpop 
business when a national franchise liani calls them the big 
boys rides into town 
dunkin donuts is the newcomer in their case and it has hitched 
itself up right across the street from the lianis little shop 
what youve really got here is two countries fighting a war 
and ones fighting with sticks and the other country has guns 
said liani 31 
the lianis have poured their adult lives into the donut ring a 
shoeboxsize diner with 10 swivel stools a formica counter and 
freshly brewed coffee 
there was always security knowing that we had our own 
business said lorrie liani 30 there wasnt a threat until 
now somebodys next door taking our customers away and taking 
money out of our pockets and taking food out of our mouths 
the lianis said their business has dropped 10 percent to 15 
percent over the first month so its not as bad as i thought it 
might be liani said 
much of the donut rings business comes from the morning traffic 
of professors and students to salem state and from commuters on 
their way to boston about 20 miles to the south 
the lianis depend on the shop to pay for their home their two 
cars and the hundreds of other debts that come from raising two 
children and running a business 
basically were just working people like everybody else its 
not like were making more money than we know what to do with 
liani said we have mortgages we have car payments like 
everybody else we rely on a weekly paycheck to pay for all that 
patrick kaufmann an assistant professor of business 
administration and marketing at harvard university who specializes 
in franchises said theres not much more to say than thats 
business 
he said about onethird of all retail dollars in the united 
states are spent at franchises each year 
the numbers suggest a homogenization of our society and our 
tastes and our mobility he said standardization is something 
that is being sought franchising is a huge business 
kaufmann said that while the situation the lianis face is sad 
it should be remembered that most franchises also are owned by 
smallbusiness men and women with their own families 
i dont see much evidence that franchises actively try to 
threaten independent businesses large franchises look for good 
retail space and potential customers if they find them they 
compete with everyone nearby he said but im sure when these 
small independents find themselves competing with the franchises it 
can be quite daunting 
liani is frustrated by the money franchises have behind them 
money for advertising facilities and equipment its hard for 
independent shops to compete he says 
and you know i cant afford to lose money as long as that 
guy because he might have three or four more successful stores if 
ones losing money the others make up for it he said 
fernando cafua a businessman from north andover runs the 
dunkin donuts across from the lianis he also owns three 
franchises in lawrence and is planning more 
dunkin donuts which speaks for its franchises has 1651 shops 
in the united states and 191 in massachusetts said lawrence 
hantman a vice president and general counsel for the company 
there are four dunkin donuts in salem a city of more than 
38200 people best known for the witch trials of the 1690s a fifth 
is on the way 
hantman said for the most part franchise owners decide on their 
own locations we have no real estate involvement in it he 
said 
the lianis arent giving up so far they havent had to worry 
about a price war both doughnut shops charge about the same 
prices the donut ring for example has cheaper coffee but more 
expensive filled doughnuts 
and they upgraded their shop they bought a new refrigerated 
display case and expanded and remodeled they also added specialty 
items like pie crusts and croissants 
were going to try and offer things that they dont have like 
if you want a chocolate cupcake with real whipped cream like mom 
used to make youd be able to get it here not there liani 
said 
i have 11 years of my life here he said i have a loyal 
following im not going to give my business away because someones 
threatening to put me out of business id rather go out fighting 
than give up

these days are a time of special grace say 
the us roman catholic bishops they say changes in eastern europe 
signal not only new freedoms for peoples but enable conversion of 
arms budgets to enhancing life and peace 
that theme was sounding in many religious circles 
with the fading of the cold war the global mission ministry 
unit of the presbyterian church usa applauded moves for mutual 
troop reductions and hailed the surge for freedom for truth 
and international concord 
it should replace eastwest competition with a new partnership 
for peace and justice in europe and the world the catholic 
bishops said 
curbing the arms race and putting a greater share of resources 
into easing social ills and improving the lot of the poor has been 
a longtime plea of most mainline churches 
the changed circumstances accentuated that cause 
the evangelical lutheran church in americas socialaction 
commission says the new opportunities for peace open the way 
for redirecting military expenditures to humanitarian purposes 
representatives of major protestant and eastern orthodox 
churches in the the national council of churches were expected to 
speak out on the matter at a meeting may 1618 in pittsburgh 
in one of several recent statements on social policies urging 
the shift of arms spending to alleviate human needs at home and 
abroad the 53bishop board of the us catholic conference said 
we thank a providential god for the gracefilled time in which 
we live for the advent of a new era declaring that this new 
moment has swept away years of stultifying controls in 
eastern europe the statement added 
we see signs of a deeper movement of the spirit a reassertion 
of the transcendent of a deeper understanding of the full meaning 
of what it is to be human 
americans have an historic opportunity to assist the newly 
freed peoples in rebuilding their societies the midapril 
statement said adding 
with a reordering of national priorities we will be able to 
do our part in this region of the world while at the same time 
meeting other unmet human and social needs both at home and in the 
developing world 
the presbyterians in a statement proposed for their general 
assembly in june said they rejoiced at the crumbling of barriers 
between east and west and added 
we give thanks for the strong and courageous leadership of the 
many christians who were at the forefront of the movements for 
freedom for truth for human rights 
we strongly support moves in your country and ours for troop 
reductions in europe those of the united states the soviet union 
and those of your individual countries 
bishops of the catholic conference in another statement put 
before the house and senate budget committees in late march noted 
that they have long urged less military spending and greater 
investment in human needs adding 
these concerns take on added urgency given the dramatic 
changes in the world the pressing needs of new democracies 
and the continuing reality of hunger homelessness and poverty in 
our own land and around the world 
the bishops specifically questioned going ahead with the 
strategic defense initiative called star wars the stealth 
bomber and mx missile saying many experts consider them of 
dubious value 
military outlays can undermine human welfare the bishops said 
adding we see the tragic consequences of misplaced priorities in 
our shelters and soup kitches in our hospitals parishes and 
schools 
in a letter to members of the congressional committees 
archbishop roger mahony of los angles chairman of an international 
policy committee and bishop james malone of youngstown ohio head 
of a domestic policy committee said 
we can support democracy abroad and fight hunger and 
homelessness at home we can also address the problems of 
inadequate health care and education in our own land 
but that demands cutting unnecessary spending including reduced 
military expenditures in light of the diminishing threat and 
transition to an economy less dependent on military spending 
the bishops said 
abroad they said a major shift from military assistance to 
economic aid is essential if we are to meet our international 
moral obligations 
the federal budget was termed not just a fiscal blueprint but 
also a moral document reflecting the conscience of america about 
its responsibilities

it was 1987 and there was the softspoken 
and fatherly dr donald westphall of st elsewhere baring his 
bottom in a showdown with the fictional hospitals new owner 
but that really was actor ed flanders bottom and it really was 
naked and it really was broadcast to millions of television sets 
during prime time 
this season la law broke ground by breaking wind a young 
man suffering from tourettes syndrome uttered racial slurs on the 
witness stand the insufferable douglas brackman was the recipient 
of a sexual favor delivered by a female bailiff crouched under his 
desk 
during a recent impromptu lovemaking session on 
thirtysomething michael promised an undiaphragmed hope that he 
would practice coitus interruptus in the same series two gay men 
were shown in bed together 
all of this on network television in prime time 
you bet and theres more 
it used to be that you couldnt say the p word on 
television as in pregnant as in when lucy was carrying little 
ricky and everyone referred to her as being in the family way 
but now as networks struggle to compete against independent 
stations cable networks and home video rentals shows on the big 
three in the 10 pm time slot break taboos with each broadcast 
fox broadcasting pushes the envelope earlier on sundays with the 
raunchy sitcoms the simpsons and married with children 
so if youre sitting on the couch flipping through the dial 
you will see cursing sex societal nonos plenty of double 
entendres and even some nudity 
but although the networks have lightened up and audiences have 
become more sophisticated there still are taboos 
yet the producers of two of televisions more adventurous shows 
say it is an arbitrary and weird bargaining system that decides 
what makes it onto television and what doesnt 
its like arms negotiations said william finkelstein 
supervising producer of nbcs la law 
explains executive producer david kelley the network will say 
things like well let you have two bastards if you take out that 
son of a bitch 
when finkelstein and kelley wanted to have a bare bottom on 
their show nbc said no even though it let st elsewhere show 
one three years ago 
the reason context said kelley evidently nbc considered 
the demure westphalls mooning more compelling than la 
law wanting to film a naked derriere as part of an episode that 
opened at a nudist colony 
but when brackman enlists the help of a sex surrogate 
experiences pronounced flatulence during their interlude and passes 
out the network said nothing 
the producers said nbc gives them great license when it comes to 
story lines but when it comes to enforcing programming standards 
finkelstein said it is a sliding scale that has nothing to do with 
morals 
i think its all money finkelstein said i dont think 
morality enters into it at all if they thought the market would do 
well theyd put nudity on tv 
dont viewers protest dont they write letters 
according to kelley the biggest viewer outrage was over taking 
the lords name in vain 
we used goddamn twice last year the network said ok the 
public backlash was so severe we had to dub it for the reruns 
kelley said 
over at abcs thirtysomething the network threatened to not 
air the episode in which michael promises hope during sex that he 
will er stop early 
we went around and around and around on this thing said 
scott winant the shows supervising producer when they saw the 
cut and the way in which we portrayed it they gave in they let us 
keep the scene 
like finkelstein and kelley winant said network standards are 
sometimes impossible to predict 
who knows winant said theres nothing in writing we are 
just amazed at where they draw the line 
its ridiculous to some extent he said in the case of 
the two men in bed we just pushed it a little too far with them 
they said do you have to say bitch twice in one episode and we 
said ok youve given us two guys in bed so well take out one 
bitch 
you couldnt say pregnant years ago so i guess weve overcome 
that winant said the networks want to give at least the 
appearance of being more openminded 
elsewhere in television 
more on the diceman speaking of curse words comedian marty 
brill issued this statement about saturday night live performer 
nora dunn refusing to participate in this weekends show because 
foulmouthed comic andrew dice clay is the host 
andrew dice clay showed a great deal of class and restraint in 
the muchpublicized saturday night live matter by not pointing 
out that nora and dunn are both fourletter words 
so are dice and clay

the task of managing money in a personal 
retirement plan brings out the cautious streak in many american 
savers 
with their longterm future resting heavily on individual 
retirement accounts employersponsored 401k plans and similar 
taxfavored arrangements they tend to see these nest eggs as too 
important to be exposed to the risks of volatile markets 
hence theres a widespread appetite for interestbearing 
investments especially those covered by some sort of guarantee 
rather than alternatives that are subject to the ups and downs of 
the securities markets 
for example even after the runaway bull market in stocks of the 
1980s more than half of all americans individual retirement 
account assets was on deposit at banks savings institutions and 
credit unions 
about 22 percent of the total ira assets of 393 billion as of 
the end of 1988 was entrusted to mutual funds according to 
estimates by the investment company institute a trade group 
whats more within the mutual funds share of the ira business 
54 percent of the money was invested in income and money market 
funds leaving 46 percent entrusted to managers of stock funds 
most experts on the subject agree that these statistics show a 
justified sense of prudence 
retirement accounts are designed to foster longterm saving not 
speculative financing of highrisk ventures some of the tax rules 
covering them reinforce that basic principle 
ordinarily a capital loss on something such as a stockmarket 
investment can be written off against your ordinary income up to a 
limit of 3000 per year on your tax return no such consolation 
is available however within retirement accounts that provide for 
deferral of any income taxation until withdrawals begin 
yet with all this many financial advisers say it is easy to get 
too cautious in your retirement saving choices overemphasizing 
safety of your dollar investment while overlooking the hazards of 
inflation 
the longer the time you have before retirement they say the 
stronger the historical case for stock marketrelated investments 
over a long time horizon an equity portfolio should perform 
at least as well as and most likely better than a fixedincome 
portfolio says the accounting firm of deloitte amp touche in a 
current bulletin on the subject 
for all 20year periods starting in any month dating back to 
1926 the standard amp poors 500stock composite index posted a 
better return than was available from treasury bills the firm says 
stock returns vary drastically they reached 193 percent a year 
in the 1950s fell to 59 percent by the 1970s and rebounded to 
175 percent in the 1980s according to the investment management 
firm of t rowe price associates 
however says deloitte amp touche people who make regular 
contributions to retirement savings programs actually can turn 
these ups and downs to their benefit through the phenomenon known 
as dollar cost averaging 
when similar dollar amounts are invested at intervals in say a 
stock mutual fund the money buys more shares at lower prices 
helping to reduce the average price paid per share 
the periodic investing that occurs in retirement accounts 
which is in effect dollar cost averaging has a much more 
positive effect on volatile investments than on nonvolatile 
investments deloitte amp touche notes 
the risk in this of course is that stocks in the future might 
not live up to the standards of the past in an investment that 
drops steadily over time and never rebounds dollarcost averaging 
isnt much help 
but over the past couple of generations longterm investors 
have been amply rewarded for taking that chance

there is a bright side to the malicious looking 
inflation rate of the first quarter and probably to the higher 
jobless rate too 
each of these reports issued separately caused a flurry of 
worry 
if the high inflation rate were sustained it was feared the 
federal reserve would be forced to raise interest rates which 
already are high enough to crimp the style of buyers and sellers of 
homes and cars 
if the jobless rate in april it had its first pronounced rise 
in more than a year were to continue rising then it would 
indicate that the economy was losing even more of its already 
feeble strength 
when you look for trouble in the economic numbers you can always 
find it a lot depends upon the psychological mood into which the 
statistical confetti is tossed and judging by the reaction that 
mood already was turning dour 
the shocking jump of the consumer price index in the first three 
months helped to blacken the mood rising at an annualized rate of 
more than 8 percent the worst showing since the first quarter of 
1981 the cpi suggested serious trouble 
the worries were deepened by the breadth of the numbers 
practically all major categories showed increases some of 
sufficient size to remind worriers about the double digit days of 
the 1970s 
food prices were up 11 percent energy up 19 percent apparel 11 
percent and lodging costs 22 percent some of those items are so 
necessary to personal well being that buyer resistance could not be 
applied to bring prices down 
the good news 
spring has come the amazing output of the nations agriculture 
industry is now providing a cornucopia for markets warmer weather 
already has forced reductions in fuel costs lodging vacancy rates 
are high everywhere 
these factors logic suggests would make double digit inflation 
a very unlikely event during the summer months but what about 
clothing costs a very typical situation that is bound to correct 
itself say those who know 
in late winterearly spring and again in the fall new 
merchandise is put on the market generally at higher prices in 
the months that follow however those prices come down because 
merchants must clear the racks for newer items 
heres how analysts at shearson lehman hutton inc explain the 
phenomenon 
march and april have seen 30 percent or higher price increases 
for many years normally this retail pricing pattern washes out in 
yearoveryear comparisons as one years high march prices are 
compared to the previous years high march prices and conversely 
lowpriced months are compared 
in short there was little that couldnt be explained about the 
firstquarter runup in prices the news wasnt really sufficient to 
bring out all those bleak views of the future the facts werent 
there but the mood was 
the rise in the jobless rate for april might be something of the 
same sort a signal not to be taken too seriously it rose after 
all by just twotenths of 1 percent to 53 percent of the labor 
force from 51 percent in march 
is that a significant rise 
janet norwood commissioner of labor statistics seemed not to 
think so she told congress that thus far we can discern no 
meaningful changes in the measures that might signal a 
deteriorating unemployment situation 
jobless figures moreover are subject to statistical revision 
and it would be no surprise to see the number lowered as additional 
data are analyzed 
the smallest downward revision would be just onetenth of 1 
percent but you might find it worthwhile to consider that such a 
reduction would mean cutting in half the worrisome jump in the 
jobless rate for april

always before madison avenue has aimed its 
religion advertising pitch at the nonuser urging outsiders to 
attend worship that rarely worked so the approach has been 
changed 
its now aimed at the users themselves the loyal churchgoers 
with some large expectations and a risky dash of humor thrown in to 
add some sparkle 
invite a friend goes the keynote phrase and in some 
cartoon ads and television spots a hardy worshipper virtually 
drags a reluctant nonparticipant into involvement 
theres a great deal of gloom and doom in most public service 
advertising said ruth wooden president of the advertising 
council which cooperates in the venture with an interfaith 
coalition religion in american life 
its much more effective psychology to say lets laugh 
together at ourselves she added it diffuses hesitations 
however the basic switch is in focusing the appeal on active 
members of churches and synagogues rather than on nonmembers as in 
the past seeking to enlist millions of present worshippers into 
inducing others to come along 
thats the big ticket approach in advertising parlance said 
laurel cutler vice chairman and director of marketing planning for 
the fcb leber katz partners agency which developed the current 
campaign 
advertising no matter how brilliant cant do it alone on a 
long considered decision but is only one step so we turn to 
mobilizing those already doing it to foster it through friends 
she said 
that also has been found through studies to be the 
overwhelmingly principal draw that gets newcomers into religious 
activity 
the rev nicholas b van dyck president of rial including 
protestant roman catholic eastern orthodox and jewish bodies 
said 86 percent of americans involved in congregations were invited 
by a friend or relative 
much recent data suggests that to encourage human behavior 
needs persontoperson influence he said were shifting the 
focus from those who arent attending worship to members who are 
he said only 1 percent of newcomers are drawn by direct 
advertising appeals to them this is a very different campaign 
with extensive grassroots involvement 
introductory materials including an action guide on 
enlisting and training volunteers and forming task forces are 
being distributed to participating groups totalling more than 56 
million members 
van dyck a presbyterian told a news conference that this 
years campaign launches a 10year project with fresh ads 
developed each year or so to increase church membership about 40 
percent to top 200 million in the decade 
currently us religious membership totals 154 million 62 
percent of the population polls find that 42 percent of the 
population attends worship weekly 
public service ads were distributed to newspapers and magazines 
across the country in april spots on television and radio transit 
posters and outdoor billboard ads appear this fall 
estimates put the combined value of the advertising used at 20 
million 
the current campaign also is emphasizing the public service 
contributions of religious congregations 
surveys find members are three times more likely than 
unaffiliated people to be involved in social services such as 
feeding the hungry housing the homeless and elderly caring for 
the sick providing child care 
congregations provide money outside their own expenses for 
such human services twice that given by all corporations and 
foundations combined studies have found 
religion is one of the key resources in meeting human need 
ms wooden said to the extent we increase participation it 
contributes proportionately more to improving society 
she said results of the new campaign will be measureable over a 
period of time since it asks specific action rather than being 
aimed at modifying attitudes of nonparticipants as in the past 
the 40yearold rial was started in 1949 as a collaboration 
between religious bodies and the advertising industry including 
numerous corporate advertisers 
ms cutler whose firm contibuted about 500000 worth of work 
on this years campaign said participating religious leaders 
solidly backed the use of humor in some of the ads 
it was a gutsy strongmided decision she said noting 
that religious appeals usually are solemn she said humor can be a 
dangerous device but it also can help humanize an appeal 
and give it more natural empathy 
noting the studies showing that people who participate in the 
life of a church or synagogue truly make a difference in society 
she added 
this country would clearly be better able to meet todays 
challenges if more of us were part of the mix of friendships 
aspirations and service to others that comes with being a part of a 
church or synagogue

jeanne white knew her son probably would 
lose his battle against aids at a young age now a month after 
ryans death she has taken up his aids education mission to keep 
his memory and ideals alive 
ryan had fought for the right to attend public school near 
kokomo battled against aids discrimination and struggled to 
promote aids education 
he won each battle but his last he died april 8 at age 18 of an 
aidsrelated respiratory infection 
mrs whites home is filled with photographs of ryan with the 
celebrities he called friends his car magazines and comic books 
are scattered through the house his dogs romp in the yard and the 
red ford mustang his buddy singer michael jackson gave him is in 
the garage 
his suitcase packed with new clothes for a trip to florida 
remains opened across his bed 
hes all around me said mrs white 42 
but some things are different this mothers day the house is 
colder 
ryan who was diagnosed as having acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome in december 1984 at age 13 was often cold a special 
heater he used to warm his hands is still in front of the 
television and a pair of slippers sit empty nearby 
ryan was always with his heater because ryan was always 
cold mrs white said now the spring breeze sweeps through open 
windows and doors 
before ryan entered riley hospital for children for the final 
time mrs white had considered moving him and her 16yearold 
daughter andrea to californias more moderate climate 
those plans are no longer being considered instead mrs white 
plans to continue ryans work in aids education from their home 
about 20 miles north of indianapolis 
already she has testified on capitol hill for the passage of a 
bill that would provide 600 million to help fight aids the senate 
labor and human resources committee approved the legislation last 
month and dedicated the bill to ryan 
a member of the american federation for aids research mrs 
white traveled to new york city to speak about aids on world kids 
day may 6 
the torch has been passed 
im just going to try and work in the back of things if 
progress can be made through ryans name im going to work through 
it i want to work any way i can she said 
ryan contracted aids from a blood byproduct used to treat his 
hemophilia his mother knew he would have health problems when he 
was only a few days old was circumcised and bled profusely at 5 
he began twiceweekly injections to help clot his blood 
mrs white said she thought the blood byproduct was a miracle 
drug because at that time hemophiliacs lived only to age 12 or 13 
little did we know that the same thing we thought would save 
them would destroy them she said nobody told us where they 
get the blood they pay people to donate it chances are that ryan 
got it from an iv drug user but it could have been from anybody 
thats why we never pointed any fingers 
the whites were unable to sue the company that produced the 
blood product because of a state law that bars lawsuits for 
illnesses stemming from blood or blood derivatives 
mrs white said she wont fight the law im through with 
attorneys she said 
the family did however win a legal battle to keep ryan in 
public school he was barred from western middle school nea kokomo 
in 1985 because school officials feared the health risk for other 
children was too great 
the courts finally ruled that ryan could attend school his 
courage and determination captured the hearts of people worldwide 
and suddenly he was in demand as a spokesman 
now that aids is better understood mrs white said some 
kokomoarea residents have told her they regret their part in 
trying to keep her son out of school 
david rosselot attorney for the group of parents who sued to 
keep ryan out of school attended ryans funeral he said if he 
had to do it again he would not have taken the case mrs white 
said 
after winning the legal battle the whites moved about 20 miles 
away to cicero where they were welcomed by the school district and 
the community 
ryan lived the life of a normal teenager hanging out with 
friends dating his prom date for this year heather mcnew 
decided not to go to the dance after ryan died 
mrs white is trying to move forward her friends and family 
keep expecting her to wear out with all the activity especially 
answering the thousands of cards and letters she has received since 
ryans death but she believes she can stay strong 
she is planning a memorial day ceremony to mark her sons 
achievements at that time a headstone will be placed on the grave 
at the cicero cemetery 
ryans grave is covered with flowers notes and wax from a 
burning candle mrs white tends twice a day there is also a poster 
made by soldiers from fort benjamin harrison it is special to her 
because of ryans fondness for gi joe dolls she said 
actor matt frewer who played the computergenerated tv 
character max headroom bought the headstone which was planned at 
first to be 5 feet tall ryans height now it will stand 6foot8 
because ryan always wished he was taller his mother said 
the inscription on the blackandwhite headstone will be written 
by ryans friends jackson and elton john 
i just want everything to be as positive as he was jeanne 
said in the evening i pray and i tell him stupid stuff that 
happens i really think he would not come back from where he is 
at mrs white said as much as we loved each other hes 
happy 
the only thing he might come back for is a saleen a 
highperformance version of the mustang automobile she said 
with a laugh wiping away tears

anyone whos tried to forage for vinyl in a 
music store knows the frustrating truth records are dying 
but the speed with which they are disappearing has led some 
music fans not just vinyl romantics to wonder whether its a 
natural death or if records are being killed off prematurely 
the bad news has been piling up this year 
warnerelektraatlantic announces it will cut out more than 40 
percent of its vinyl catalog that means 1205 album titles owned 
by the conglomerate will no longer be available on records 
the tower records chain says it wont sell 7inch singles 
anymore thats after several major labels including cbs and aampm 
say they wont accept returns on unsold records 
two major labels polygram and chrysalis announce that with 
a few rare exceptions all their new releases will be only on 
cassette tape and compact disc 
its really kicked in with a vengeance for the last six 
months said robert cohen manager of the finyl vinyl record 
store in new york city things that people took for granted 
things that they used to see in the record bins for the last 20 
years are now gone 
the day will come sooner than most people expect when it will 
be rare to find a new album released on vinyl predicted michael 
stotter chrysalis vice president for marketing 
by christmas 1990 when the next burst of cd hardware buying 
takes place vinyl will be virtually nonexistent he said 
the facts show record buyers are part of a minority group 
growing smaller every day manufacturers shipped out 34 million 
records in 1989 according to the recording industry association of 
america thats less than half what they shipped the year before 
and a fraction of the 341 million during the precd era year of 
1978 
by contrast manufacturers shipped out 207 million cds and 446 
million cassettes during 1989 
the reasons are simple boom boxes and small portable 
cassette players are the favorites of kids these days and 
wealthier music lovers have been seduced by the sound of cds 
weve seen this happen in the industry before said trish 
heimers riaa spokeswoman from the 78s to the compact disc the 
industry has always been changing as the technology changed 
people moved on 
the music business has powerful reasons for helping people move 
on as fast as possible it doesnt pay to keep pressing plants 
humming when theyre turning out a trickle of records 
merchants in turn would like to ditch records so theyll have 
more room to store cassettes and the more expensive compact discs 
only 2 percent of sales in the 82store record world chain are in 
records so vinyl is being phased out said mitch imber purchasing 
director 
something had to give he said 
thats all ammunition for conspiracy theorists who think records 
are being killed off too fast 
the industry itself has tried to make records obsolete 
instead of the marketplace making them obsolete said johnny 
konrad who owns johnnys record store in darien conn its the 
tail wagging the dog the industry wants to make it harder to get 
records to establish the cds 
john riopelle a student at the junior college of albany said 
he frequently feels like an antiques collector when searching for 
records riopelle cant afford a cd player and said he prefers the 
look of an album with its cover art and liner notes to a cassette 
its disconcerting he said when he can find his favorite 
alternative rock albums only in the import bin priced higher than 
cds i would like to be able to continue to buy them and not have 
the latest technology shoved down my throat 
merchants still interested in stocking records say return 
policies and reordering difficulties are putting pressure on them 
to relent 
many record companies charge a penalty for return of an unsold 
record for instance konrad said hell get only 450 to return a 
record for which he paid 6 even if its defective but theres no 
penalty for cassette and cd returns 
the decisions of so many record companies not to accept returns 
on 7inch singles is what drove tower records out of the business 
of 45s store managers had to worry about ordering too few records 
and selling out or ordering too many and being left with worthless 
extras 
konrad said hes continually frustrated in ordering new copies 
of records hes ordered copies of keith richards talk is 
cheap album every week since september and in late march still 
hadnt gotten any hes had only one shipment of the b52s cosmic 
thing album on vinyl and its a top 10 hit 
rocky roy owner of the music shack in albany tries to keep new 
records in stock because many of his musichungry customers arent 
willing to risk 15 for a cd of an artist they barely know 
a recent experience by chrysalis shows the volatility of this 
changeover the second album by irish singer sinead oconnor 
released in late march was initially one of the albums the record 
company planned to release only on cd and cassette 
oconnor coming from a country where vinyl still reigns cried 
foul chrysalis relented and printed records and stotter said 
the company received almost 40000 orders for lps before the album 
was even released far more than it expected 
stotter admitted he underestimated the appeal of vinyl for 
oconnors new album which has topped the charts since its release 
but it doesnt change his opinion that the days of vinyl are 
numbered and he says the industry is innocent of forcing the trend 
i dont think the record companies are trying to kill it off 
at all he said its the people who frequent records stores 
who are showing less and less interest in records 
as a collector with thousands of records herself heimer 
sympathizes with record fanatics but the one or two or 12 or 100 
lp buyers who are shouting that theyre killing it off prematurely 
just arent buying millions of lps to make it worthwhile for the 
companies she said 
the fast disappearance of lps has given rise to a new type of 
specialty store trying to fill the vacuum created by big chains 
abandoning lps one such store last chance records in chicago 
shuns cds 
finyl vinyl had no irony in mind when it took its name five 
years ago cohen said now it specifically caters to a 
vinylstarved public particularly with hardtofind used records 
from the 1960s 
you can go into any chain store today in any mall looking 
for a copy of any of the famous bob dylan albums from the 1960s and 
you wont find it anymore on album he said 
thats amazing to me thats scandalous

the supreme court this weeks takes up 
congress attempt to protect the american flag from desecration 
while the issue before the justices is the laws constitutionality 
politics wont be far below the surface 
the high court will hear arguments monday and is expected to 
rule by the time its current term ends probably in late june or 
early july if the law is struck down a proposed constitutional 
amendment to protect the flag almost certainly would become a 
leading issue in congressional and state legislative races this 
fall 
the onehour argument session is extraordinary on only three 
occasions in recent times has the court heard arguments on a case 
so late in a session 
the law the flag protection act of 1989 makes it a crime 
punishable by up to a year in prison for anyone who burns 
mutilates defaces or tramples on the flag or maintains it on 
the floor or ground 
the court will examine its past rulings on the first amendment 
safeguards of free speech and expression 
while the bush administration defends the law its no secret 
president bush and leading republicans would prefer a 
constitutional amendment to ban flag burning something that would 
be unnecessary if the justices uphold the law 
the prime sponsors of the law are democrats who learned a 
bitter lesson from the 1988 presidential campaign in which bush 
exploited patriotic values in defeating gov michael dukakis of 
massachusetts 
new york gov mario cuomo possibly a future democratic 
presidential contender put the matter in perspective in a brief 
submitted to the high court 
if the law is struck down the brief said there will be a 
serious and profound impact on new york and other states because 
such a ruling would almost certainly trigger a divisive battle in 
congress and in the states over whether a constitutional amendment 
to permit a ban on flag burning should be passed 
the speaker of the house rep thomas s foley dwash has 
promised a house vote on a constitutional amendment within 30 days 
if the court invalidates the law 
such an amendment proclaiming that a ban on flag burning does 
not violate free speech would require approval by twothirds of 
the members of the house and senate and then ratification by 38 
state legislatures 
the first amendment has not been modified since it took force 
199 years ago 
when lawyers for the administration and demonstrators who have 
burned flags address the court monday they may target justice 
harry a blackmun more than the other eight jurists 
blackmun voted with the majority in june when the justices by a 
54 margin struck down a texas law barring desecration or 
destruction of the flag the court said that burning the flag as a 
form of political protest is protected by the constitutions 
freespeech guarantees 
but blackmun in a 1974 ruling indicated he might go along with 
some laws to protect the flags physical integrity 
in that case blackmun dissented as the court threw out the 
conviction of a massachusetts man who wore a small flag on the seat 
of his pants 
the flag protection act was a reaction to the courts june 
ruling and the political firestorm that followed 
house democratic leaders say the law differs from the texas 
statute because the federal act does not single out flag burning as 
a means of expression 
the texas law specifically banned flag burning that seriously 
offends others 
the federal law forbids defiling or destruction of the flag for 
any purpose except to destroy a soiled or tattered flag 
the justice department in a written brief to the court said 
it is the physical assault and accompanying violation of the 
flags physical integrity not robust and uninhibited debate 
that occasion the injury that our society should not be called upon 
to bear 
moreover the department said the court owes congress special 
deference in this case because an equal branch of government has 
determined flag burning can be outlawed without violating freedom 
of speech 
lawyers for the demonstrators said their clients consider flag 
burning an essential element of their political expression because 
for them the flag represents not glory but oppression 
they also said flag desecration has been an american tradition 
the united states flag was born of a desecration the lawyers 
said george washington in 1776 defaced a british flag by 
ordering sewn upon it 13 red and white stripes

four years ago a band called poi dog pondering 
gathered once a week under swaying palm trees in front of a 
woolworths store in waikiki playing for small change from bemused 
tourists 
today the group has a sevenalbum contract with columbia 
records after an agonizing eightmonth major label bidding war 
that was won primarily when columbias president intervened to woo 
the band 
besides the record deal poi dog has acquired other 
accoutrements of success a manager a lawyer videos on music 
television and a european tour their debut album with columbia 
wishing like a mountain thinking like the sea was released 
last month 
the journey from lava rock to black rock cbss monolithic black 
marble headquarters in manhattan began in 1986 when poi dogs 
leader frank orrall proposed that anyone who wanted to tour the 
mainland show up at honolulu international airport 
nine took the leap and ended up cramming all their instruments 
and belongings into two cars for an extended openended 
crosscountry trip not knowing where they would go or how they 
would support themselves two of the original group remain in the 
band today 
poi dog hawaiian slang for a mixbreed dog is a fitting 
moniker for the group that combines the usual guitar bass and 
drums with the notsousual latvian lap harp an accordian the 
flugelhorn tin whistle wood block and somebodys used frying pan 
for five months the musical caravan rambled across the 
continent on the road and off orrall wrote songs that combined 
earthy imagery with a focus on love and death endured lifes pain 
and reveled in its joy most songs have upbeat flourishes that have 
led some critics to grumble that the tunes are just too happy 
during their meanderings orrall nurtured a contract deal with 
texas hotel records based in santa monica calif he met the 
labels owners michael meister and susan farrell in 1984 when 
they had a record store texas records that catered to alternative 
bands and small labels bands such as rem 10000 maniacs and 
concrete blonde stopped by the store to play for free 
meister and farrell later closed the shop to join forces with 
steve tesluk to create a label full of ripe acts including former 
black flag leader henry rollins and his band downy mildew and new 
acts such as baby flamehead and new chestnut 
orrall liked the people at texas hotel because they were such 
defenders of the young and the raw poi dog made two ep records 
with texas hotel under a fivealbum contract but the terms were 
not ironclad 
poi dog began to get gigs and huge exposure at major 
recording industry conventions and the suits as those from 
independent labels like to derisively call major label record 
executives were hungry for the alternative sound one that 
doesnt generally rely on synthesizers or heavy technology in the 
recording studio 
alternative songs also shy away from traditional pop and rock 
structures and often combine influences from other cultures and 
ethnic groups recording is cheaper done in fewer takes and rarely 
is heavily remixed sometimes giving it more of a garage band feel 
and alternative music is rooted in idealism music for musics 
sake and not for commerical prosperity 
poi dogs big break came in 1988 when texas hotel arranged 
several gigs at the new music seminar in new york city a hotbed of 
record execs looking for the next new big thing 
the group traveled by van once again to new york a trip that 
was chronicled by avantgarde filmmaker and animator laura 
margulies who is currently working on an animation for a future 
music video 
thats when people became interested orrall said record 
executives called aamprs for artist and repertoire started 
appearing at poi dog concerts 
one was michael hill who was scouting sounds for warner bros 
i thought they were fun hill said but i didnt get a great 
impression of them one way or another 
a few months later hill saw them in a better venue and became 
an instant fan i was just knocked out by it 
hill made overtures and told orrall hed like to talk more he 
also began to follow the group around the country like a school 
boy with a bad case of puppy love 
by the time they reached austin for the southbysouthwest 
music conference it was so out of control everyone in the 
business came to the show they were great hill said 
one aampr executive who took notice was columbias michael 
gallelli i heard their music on tape before i saw them he 
said and it was really one of those things where i was a fan 
first 
he liked poi dogs diverse influences they were combining 
lots of different styles like african to caribbean to celtic 
infuences i thought that was really great that they were able to 
bring it all together and then there was a storytelling aspect 
that i really liked 
in the meantime thoughts of playing an east coast gig were 
making orrall nervous because he knew that after the last song was 
performed the stage would be overtaken by a tribe of record execs 
by that time even though orrall wasnt rushing to sign with 
anyone it was boiling down to a deal with either warner bros or 
aampm 
warners with its solid reputation as a haven for independent 
alternative music interested orrall but the label wasnt sure if 
it could sign poi dog he said because they had a lot going on 
with other bands aampm which had been independently owned and was 
in the process of being bought out was tempting but the prospect 
of new ownership made the band nervous 
we were on texas hotel we had all the creative freedom that 
we wanted we could do anything he said it was a perfect 
situation i was in no hurry to give any of that away for a bigger 
venue

ienner at 36 became the labels youngest president when he took 
over last april he was at his new job for less than 48 hours when 
he heard the poi dog tape and decided to make the band his cause 
celebre 
i must have had 40 tapes that weekend ienner said all of 
the sudden this thing came on and i was astounded by it 
he especially liked the song living with the dreaming body 
which begins with a lilting tin whistle and listened to it about 
100 times he later mastered the tin whistle so he could play the 
intro himself 
after checking around he found columbia was either the 11th 
or 12th company interested in the band that really got my juices 
going 
basically we told them we wanted them and they said they 
dont want to be with columbia ienner said the band 
thought its too corporate its too monolithic its too 
bureaucratic 
but when ienner met poi dogs manager mike stewart they 
n of america 
in 1975 an infamously slow time for the recording industry 
earnings totaled 237 billion the riaa said in 1978 punk and 
new wave signaled a revival and the figure jumped to 413 billion 
in 1988 625 billion was earned 
we needed to change direction ienner said there was 
nothing just retreading the superstars just one after another 
after another 
poi dog would be the columbias signature band ienner said 
to show our musical sensitivity 
it would also help establish a division within columbia that 
would cater to a huge audience carved out in large part by college 
radio stations looking for an alternative to top 40 music 
those involved refuse to discuss the deals financial side but 
many in the industry say the band was signed for more than 200000 
for the first album a new pop band can fetch anywhere from 75000 
to 350000 for its first record contract industry officals say 
the sum however doesnt just pile into the musicians pockets 
much of it is reinvested to pay for the recording costs for the 
first album the ballpark figures for recording an album go from 
about 200000 to 400000 said harold vogel an entertainment 
industry analyst with merrill lynch amp co 
another hunk goes to practical expenses such as paying off band 
members debts and still another chunk is invested in upgrading 
the bands equipment and buying new instruments 
the rest goes to lifestyle expenses to maintain the band while 
they are recording and keep them going until they get to record 
number two which brings another windfall 
although orrall is tightlipped about how much poi dog got he 
does give a general breakdown for how it was used 
what we essentially are doing with our advance is just putting 
it in an account and paying everyone in the band 1000 a month so 
everyone can quit their jobs pay their rent get their guitar 
strings and buy their beer he said 
to celebrate the contract poi dog pondering played a surprise 
set at columbias offices they set up in an elevator and when the 
doors opened they began to play 
people slowly drifted from their offices into the halls the 
sound traveled down the elevator banks and people were coming up 
the stairwells from all the floors said mary ellen cataneo a 
columbia publicist 
literally people had tears in their eyes ienner said 
people were all standing there with tears in their eyes 
it was the first time in 20 years a musician had played live at 
columbias offices the guy who did it was also a new artist a 
young piano player by the name of billy joel

tie me up tie me down 
 
by turning normal values of society topsyturvy pedro almodovar 
has established himself as spains most provocative filmmaker 
women on the verge of a nervous breakdown brought him 
international acclaim and an academy award nomination for best 
foreign language picture of 1988 
almodovars new film descriptively titled tie me up tie me 
down attracted a minor storm of controversy before its release 
in this country the ratings board of the motion picture 
association of america recoiled at a graphic sex scene and dealt 
the film an x rating an appeal failed to reverse the decision now 
miramax films is releasing the film without a rating but with a 
caution about its adult material 
the rating controversy may attract those in search of sensation 
they are likely to be disappointed admirers of almodovars work 
are likely to feel the same way 
almodovars screenplay is primarily a pas de deux between 
unlikely lovers the protagonist is a handsome young mental 
patient ricky antonio banderas who manages to talk his way out 
of an asylum where he has serviced the director as well as most of 
the nurses 
ricky is obsessed with marina victoria abril a pornography 
star who is trying to become an actress in mainstream films they 
had a brief encounter during one of his escapes from the hospital 
and he is convinced she will marry him 
how to persuade marina by kidnaping her tying her up in her 
own bedroom and waiting for her to submit 
that is the essence of tie me up there is also a subplot 
about the movie marina has been making and almodovar scores some 
satiric jabs at the absurdities of the film business 
its easy to see why the ratings board decreed the x the 
lovemaking scene is depicted in graphic style and the bondage 
theme is treated lightly 
almodovar is a worldclass filmmaker and his work is replete 
with surprises tie me up is likely to rank as one of his minor 
works provocative but unrealized the saccharine ending seems 
unworthy of him 
the actors many of them seen in previous almodovar films are 
uniformly excellent both banderas and abril are skilled as well as 
attractive adding to the voltage of their eventual union 
tie me up unrated contains sex nudity and rough 
language in spanish with english subtitles running time 105 
minutes

class of 1999 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
the program notes for class of 1999 suggest that theres 
some kind of serious message to be gleaned from this film 
dont believe it 
class of 1999 shouldnt be taken seriously it shouldnt be 
taken as satire it shouldnt be taken any way 
the ostensible premise of this gory humorless film is that if 
you think high schools are violent today wait until the turn of 
the century 
in this nightmare world we find malcolm mcdowell playing miles 
langford principal of kennedy high school in seattle gang warfare 
has grown so pervasive that the schools surroundings have been 
declared a freefire zone where even the cops dare not go 
welcome to kennedy high school says a mechanical sounding 
voice at the school entrance all weapons must be surrendered 
before entering the school grounds 
with violent incidents occurring every two hours and 38 seconds 
on average the board of education has been renamed the department 
of educational defense 
in desperation mcdowell calls in dr bob forrest played 
nonchalantly by stacy keach sporting a graywhite rattail his 
company megatech has produced three androids who look and 
sound like teachers but who give new meaning to the word 
paddling 
at first this final solution to the student discipline 
problem seems to work some kidhating audiences may even cheer as 
these mechanical teachers forcefeed pills down the throats of 
young druggies or administer earsplitting spankings to 
foulmouthed gang members until blood oozes from their mouths 
meanwhile young cody culp a semireformed youth gang leader 
played by bradley gregg senses something vaguely inhuman about 
these teachers he vainly tries to convince langfords comely 
daughter christie that her fathers drastic cure for student 
violence just might be worse than the disease 
after a few more broken necks impalements and throat gougings 
skeptical christie is convinced that theres something faintly 
unwholesome about these new faculty members though too late to 
save the life of her father who becomes another victim of these 
androids run amok 
the hopelessly muddled plot finally has rival gang members 
putting aside their blood feud to defeat the common mechanical foe 
mark l lester produced and directed class of 1999 his 
previous credits include direction of class of 1984 another 
blackboard jungletype yarn 
in program notes lester suggests some serious message in his 
latest project that the violence plaguing schools today could 
easily lead to the horrors shown in this film unless we act to 
quell it now 
forget it if this offensive film has any message at all its 
that the producers apparently believe theres a big moviegoing 
market for wholesale violence against children 
class of 1999 is rated r richly earned because of 
almost nonstop blood guts and foul language

think of an ending said he was supposed to have it ready for this 
summer but he wont have it until next summer 
next season charleston may hear two trios menotti is composing 
for cello violin and flute and for cello violin and piano 
he has finished a dirge for the death of orpheus for 
orchestra chorus and tenor soloist for the atlanta symphony 
inspired by sonnets to orpheus by rainer maria rilke in the 
cantata followers of dionysius tear orpheus body to bits and 
throw his bleeding head into the sea the head keeps singing and 
floats to a greek island where a temple was built 
its a bit of comment on the music of today menotti says 
some people have done all they can to destroy good music but the 
head of orpheus proves that true beauty goes on singing 
after the july festival in spoleto italy menotti will go to 
davos switzerland for a festival of his music then to phoenix 
where his cello fantasy will be played before charleston 
hell attend his son chips first staging of menottis the 
medium and the telephone for the hollybrook festival in 
glassboro nj 
one of menottis greatest joys is his grandson claudio who 
will be 3 on july 14 they often have breakfast together talking 
italian 
he heard that i was old the composer says he comes to me 
and says nonno grandfather youre old but youre only a 
little old 
on july 7 1991 menotti will be 80 next year a number of 
opera companies will perform his operas the medium the saint 
of bleeker street and the consul 
what he most desires is to build a private theater in scotland 
then i could do all my staging there and go to my festivals 
all i need is 1 million not two or three only one i hope 
for my 80th birthday somebody will say menotti here it is

lets talk about love robert plant says on 
the opening track of his newest album and so he does 
manic nirvana is full of reflections on love physical love 
fantasy love love gone sour but dont expect the usual or the 
serious from this rock veteran 
hes always been known as the master of capricious naughtiness 
and musical wackiness but his solo efforts since the breakup of 
led zeppelin in 1980 have been relatively tame no more 
on manic nirvana plant returns to playfully sexual lyrics 
liberally sprinkled with wit and innuendo and blended with 
abundant puns 
in big love he juxtaposes a romantic encounter with being 
at 15000 and holding on an airplane he imagines a 
relationship with a magazine model in the frustrated i cried 
and in what is probably his most accessible song to date hurting 
kind ive got my eyes on you plant moans over his love just 
like old times 
the album also contains the first acoustic song of his solo 
career liars dance a quiet but terse commentary on greed and 
religion 
and as always plant rejoices in keeping his audience guessing 
in his remake of the 1961 kenny dino song your ma said you cried 
in your sleep last night he slips in the first two verses of the 
zeppelin classic black dog just to keep you on your toes 
the music must change and it must give me the variety and 
the humor and the pomp and the mock splendor and all that sort of 
thing depending upon the mood that im in plant said in an 
interview 
the constant changing makes his music difficult to categorize 
and he likes it that way but he teasingly called it angstpomp 
part of the reason that i change it so much is to be quirky 
and to maintain the quirk he said it certainly doesnt help 
me sell more records in fact if it does anything at all it 
diminishes the chance because im not playing the natural 
straightdowntheline middleoftheroad game 
that sense of humor has helped plant to make himself less 
serious there are parts of my personality that need a lot of 
tender loving care and attention from myself to myself he said 
and there are other parts that really are very flippant and have 
to be a bit derisive 
im serious because i want to make this music sound exactly as 
it does now but at the same time i cant be too serious about it 
because there are so many holes in it and theres such folly in a 
rock n roll singers ego 
it seems that plant can now accept the strutting barechested 
attitude of his youth and temper it with the cleverness and 
imagination of maturity but despite his 42 years he is by no 
means a prude 
hes called his new album thunder and lightning condensed in a 
condom in other words its lusty but it gets its sexiness from 
plants fantasies and double entendre rather than blatant 
vulgarity 
in big love he talks of a bathroom rendezvous aboard an 
airplane i just felt that it was fair game because its 
something that everybody dreams of happening even if you have the 
most straightlaced moralistic point of view he said 
however he said hes not out to exploit or degrade women you 
have to be careful not to take it as if im heralding male 
dominance and its only for my benefit everybody would benefit 
from those sort of impromptu meetings 
plant wistfully spoke of his complete incapacity to have a 
nice calm love affair he quoted from his song she said 
which he said describes him 
so i say give me fresh horses let me ride the wild beat 
women in their houses i cant deal with their heat 
i like the seduction he said i like the kind of intrigue 
of relationships and i dont like what they do to me or what i do 
to them 
part of plants new musical freedom has come from his band 
formed before the release of now and zen guitarist doug boyle 
bassist charlie jones keyboardist phil johnstone and drummer chris 
blackwell are roughly 20 years younger than their leader but plant 
said his outlook keeps him young 
i think my attitude is my fountain of youth with or without a 
band because i feel kind of timeless he said 
i know im getting older but i dont think thats affecting 
my state of mind i surround myself with young guys because theyre 
keen and theyre excited and their contribution to everything is 
very wholehearted that marriage of enthusiasm and lack of cynicism 
and lack of worldly overwisdom its perfect for me 
as plants personality is a combination of adult wisdom and 
youthful energy so are his heroes he is a devotee of early 
bluesmen howlin wolf and gene vincent but said he admired anyone 
who could swing their hips and make me wonder what that meant 
he also praised robert smith of the cure 
of the wide variety of his heroes he quipped some of them 
are dead some of them are tired and some of them are young 
plants 1990 tour kicks off in europe on may 1 and should be in 
the states shortly after 
im very lucky he said i have a particularly strong live 
following and i havent had huge top 40 hits but ive got a pretty 
big interested live following which is great its kind of 
greater than if id had top 40 hits and nothing else

whats on the dinner table in the 1990s may 
represent one of the most tangible legacies of the 1960s even for 
those who never sprouted a bean 
the rebellion by health food nuts against plastic food 
was part of a bigger effort to live better that included the civil 
rights environmental and womens movements warren j belasco 
argues in appetite for change how the counterculture took on the 
food industry 19661988 published by pantheon books 
in his preface including the story of his discovery of 
alternative ways of eating belasco connects the dinner table to 
the political changes of the 1960s 
indeed ive found that rather than just being silly or 
perverse as our parents and skeptical peers probably thought we 
were cooking up something quite serious ambitious and yes 
radical an alternative food system with its own ideology staples 
and supply lines a countercuisine 
food he said often is ignored by analysts of our history and 
culture belasco in fact began his research intending to write 
about how the mainstream coopted counterculture efforts in rock 
n roll clothing and food the food just became too big 
the new left argued over and over that the personal was 
political and belasco argues nothing is more personal than food 
and what could be more political than challenging agribusiness 
americas largest and most evironmentally troublesome industry 
i really do think that food is one of the most substantial 
parts of our lives central to our health and our pleasure he 
said in a telephone interview from the university of maryland 
where he is an american studies professor 
belasco presents an engaging and copiously footnoted tale 
that connects food giveaways in the haightashbury of the mid1960s 
to the chocolatecovered granola bars that pass for healthy kids 
food today 
he adds spice to his theories by liberally quoting many 
underground food columnists of the 1960s appetite for change 
is not just fun though it is that it forces readers to consider 
whats in their pantries and why 
business figured out pretty quickly that the countercuisine 
could be profitable and today the profusion of socalled health 
and lite foods is ironic evidence of success of course the 
legacy also exists in food cooperatives concern over health 
organic farms and other alternative enterprises 
but the countercuisine has not turned us into a nation of 
healthy socially conscious eaters and belasco tries to explain 
why the supermarket is an additive minefield processors are 
consolidating rapidly the farm belt is a disaster area pesticides 
are out of control and we reek with contradictions like everyone 
else 
the reasons are complicated the fault of the ecofreaks as 
well as the food industry there were plenty of conflicts 
vegetarians vs meateaters white bread vs wholegrain brown 
convenience vs homemade natural vs processed ethnic dishes vs 
wasp food 
belasco also criticizes the press and the response in the 70s 
to public concerns about the food supply by a government that was 
itself a bundle of contraditions inconsistencies and 
vacillations 
and there were disputes within the counterculture over the role 
of food communes and cooperatives and hip capitalists 
it may now be hard to see revoluntionary significance in the 
eating of unhulled rice and curried carrots or granola and yogurt 
in 196970 however dietary change was one of the more substantial 
household reforms belasco writes 
twenty years later americans are again being coaxed to make 
changes that start at home consume green recycle conserve 
its good that there is all this news but im kind of 
skeptical as to how deep it is as far as earth day belasco said 
in the interview i had very mixed feelings about that as a 
really meaningful set of activities on that day 
green sounds today a lot like natural did 20 years ago 
hard to define and therefore open to fraud and real change is 
slow he noted 
the problem is the public is not going to see immediate 
gains he said people like me im a believer and im in 
there for the long pull 
todays news seems all too familiar a lot of this is deja vu 
to me we went through this 20 years ago and i think a lot of it 
got coopted he said beyond defining the content of food 
natural was a liberated state of mind a symbol of opposition to 
mass production efficiency rationalization limits 
at the other end of the spectrum massproduced processed 
food encouraged alientation from nature society ones own body 
unfortunately most consumers seemed to collaborate in their own 
alientation 
but he said he is a bit more optimistic today than even two 
years ago when he finished his book with the lessthan enthusiastic 
plea that since the odds against us were always steep i suppose 
theres no reason to lose heart now

the rules are simple for the grand ole 
oprys melvin sloan dancers 
rule no 1 is to have fun rule 2 and 3 is the same rule 
says sloan 
the energetic colorful eightperson square dance troupe is 
celebrating its 10th year on the live country music show the 
group possibly the best known square dance act in the world also 
has appeared on the tv shows hee haw the nowdefunct dolly 
parton show and other programs 
the 50yearold sloan says his troupe dances a different style 
than amateur square dance clubs around the country his group 
dances to his spontaneous calls during the routine nearly all 
the local square dancers use set patterns he says 
our style is self taught he said in an interview no one 
teaches you how to do this its kind of like playing music by ear 
ours is dancing from the heart we dance like we feel you express 
yourself by moving your feet 
sloans brother ralph directed his own opry square dance group 
from 1952 until his death in 1980 melvin then took over the group 
to maintain the tradition of a sloanled opry dance troupe 
he had never danced before but he learned quickly 
i had jumped into a lake of water and i didnt know how to 
swim he recalled about his first dance steps there was 
confusion there were times wed dance and then go to the dressing 
room and cry 
he eventually mastered the art by studying patterns that other 
group members had drawn for him on paper he spent hours in front 
of a mirror in his loft perfecting the dance steps and his 
coordination 
he finally picked up where his brother left off and the group 
continued its reputation as one of the oprys most popular acts 
theres nothing that puts electricity in a crowd like a loud 
banjo and some good dancing sloan said 
the troupe ranges in age from mid20s to 50 and is recruited 
from square dance groups in tennessee no one else in the country 
dances exactly the style done in middle tennessee he said 
i tell my dancers that if you cant give me 100 percent you 
dont need to go to the stage we are always received well sloan 
said 
they perform every other weekend on the opry a fabled show that 
has been presented weekly since 1925 a million people see the 
production in person every year and millions more listen on the 
radio thirty minutes of the threehour show is carried live each 
saturday night on cable tvs the nashville network 
the sloan dancers can tell while standing behind the curtain 
just before show time whether the crowd will be responsive or 
quiet if you hear a lot of laughter and everything sounds alive 
when the curtain goes up you can feel it its a feeling of 
energy sloan said 
his group and his brothers before it boast of never having 
missed a scheduled opry performance in 38 years but melvin sloans 
troupe barely made it to a show about three years ago during an ice 
storm 
we rushed in to the opry house and didnt have time to change 
our clothes he recalled we ran out on the stage and danced in 
our street clothes to keep the streak going 
sloan designs their costumes each of the four mens attire has 
a belt and buckle shirt necktie hanky and white pants and white 
shoes these are coordinated with the womens dress apron or 
pinafore and sash hosiery and matching ties for the shoes and 
pantaloons 
the group also performs at various nashville conventions and in 
1983 at the request of then president ronald reagan they 
performed at the kennedy center for the performing arts in 
washington 
despite the tradition and the acclaim the group is not perfect 
sometimes we make a mistake sloan said but it makes me 
feel good when someone tells us it looks like we enjoy our dancing 
so much we are as proud of our dancing as any singer is of his 
singing

deep rcabmg peter murphy 
 
the deep of former bauhaus singer peter murphys fourth solo 
project could refer to his unfathomable lyrics but murphy has said 
the title reflects both how he feels about his work deeply and 
his perception of the music which he calls deep rock 
it sounds more like doomsday disco 
murphys old outfit a postpunk british band with artistic 
pretensions was among the first to mix infectious dance grooves 
with brooding introspective lyrics 
the style lives on in this recording and in records by the cure 
the the and others favored by masses of blackgarbed club hoppers 
cuts you up a single from deep is a hit in dance clubs 
and on college radio and its hook is undeniable but it is 
difficult to imagine the selfabsorbed murphy finding a broader 
audience with songs this obtuse

ace of harps alligator charlie musselwhite 
 
charlie musselwhite sings like his vocal chords are on a leash 
but his singing is no reason to listen to ace of harps his 
debut with chicagos alligator records a master of the blues 
harmonica his playing knows no bounds 
he can play down he can play dirty he can even play pretty 
whenever he blows you hear a tradition born by little walter who 
sparked the explosion of urban blues out of chicago in the 1950s 
mississippiborn musselwhite and the late paul butterfield built 
off that tradition in the 1960s and musselwhite carries it on today 
its gritty and hard driving and powered by nononsense blowing 
that says the man with the harp is in charge for musselwhites 
definition listen to leaving your town or hangin on 
just to show he learned his blues lessons well musselwhite 
sings my road lies in darkness accompanied only by his own 
playing on acoustic guitar its the cut most suited to his deep 
drawl a man with lesser convictions would not ring true but 
musselwhite proves he hears the calling on his 14th solo album as 
strong as he did on his first 
behind musselwhite on ace of harps stand andrew jones jr 
on guitar artis joyce on bass and tommy hill on drums joyce and 
hill are solid while staying out of the way and jones punctuates 
musselwhites blowing with some wellplaced solos 
what musselwhite chooses to sing on this record is less 
important than how he approaches the material as a whole since the 
fare is pretty standard but the moment he lights into the blues 
overtook me to start things off you believe him and being 
overtaken yourself is an easy next step

lockheed corp said it will phase out all 
operations at the site where rosie the riveter cranked out 
30000 warplanes in world war ii and the skunk works designed 
americas most secret aircraft 
the nations sixth largest military contractor said the changes 
would help it adjust to a likely decline in defense spending 
we will take advantage of this situation to streamline our 
aircraft operations and enhance profitability said chairman 
donald tellep 
lockheed which has built planes in burbank since 1928 said 
tuesday it will move its aerospace division to marietta ga 
outside atlanta 
the move to georgia where lockheed already builds and services 
cargo planes at a governmentowned facility will cut costs 
substantially tellep said 
the skunk works research unit where spy planes and the stealth 
fighter were developed will become a separate subsidiary and 
gradually move from the 320acre burbank site to palmdale in the 
desert 50 miles north of los angeles 
corporate headquarters will remain in calabasas calif 
the moves mean more bad news for the aerospace industry in 
california state rep george miller said last week the state could 
lost 200000 defenserelated jobs by 1995 
mcdonnell douglas corps douglas aircraft is eliminating 3000 
jobs most of them in long beach lockheed said recently it would 
lay off 2000 workers in burbank palmdale and santa clarita along 
with 750 in marietta 
lockheed spokesman ron meder said the company would finish 
moving all operations out of burbank by the mid1990s and then 
everything will have been sold or will be for sale 
lockheeds profits plummeted from 624 million in 1988 to 2 
million in 1989 last year and the company faces tough times as 
easing world tensions pressure the government to slash defense 
spending 
the company recently won a proxy battle for control waged by 
texas investor harold simmons who owns 19 percent of lockheeds 
stock and claimed the company was mismanaged simmons did force the 
company to allow big shareholders more participation however 
tellep said lockheed would continue to develop its new p7 
submarinehunting plane in california but will build it in georgia 
lockheed also will build the advanced tactical fighter in 
georgia if it wins the competition for one of the last major 
aerospace defense contracts in this century a lockheedled team is 
competing with one led by northrop corp and a decision is 
expected by the middle of next year 
defense secretary dick cheney recently called for the atf to go 
into production in 1996 two years later than previously planned 
lockheed said delays also were likely on the p7 
securities analysts said the moves may help lockheed curry 
support for its atf bid from sen sam nunn the powerful georgia 
democrat who heads the senate armed services committee 
hes certainly somebody youd like to have on your side 
said paul h nesbit of prudential bache research in new york 
they have that huge facility down there that sam nunn has 
virtually insisted that the air force continue to keep open with 
the hope in mind there would be work 
lockheed aeronautical systems co was formed in 1987 when 
planebuilding operations in california and georgia merged under 
one management 
the division has come on hard times of late with four major 
military plane programs ended or about to end the c5 cargo plane 
the p3 antisubmarine patrol plane the tr1 highaltitude 
reconnaisance plane and the f117a stealth fighter 
employment at the marietta plant has fallen from 20000 workers 
two years ago to about 9000 lockheed officials said the shift of 
the aerospace division wouldnt lead to any immediate surge in 
employment in marietta because no new aircraft production is 
scheduled until the mid1990s 
lockheeds operations in burbank date back to 1928 it produced 
30000 fighters and bombers there during world war ii and later 
built the constellation and l1011 passengers planes the skunk 
works designed secret aircraft such as the u2 and sr71 spy planes 
and the stealth fighter 
corporate headquarters were moved from burbank to calabasas five 
years ago and lockheed recently put 225 of its 320 acres in 
burbank up for sale 
lockheed has a number of other operations throughout the country 
including its missiles and space division in sunnyvale in northern 
california which is thriving

fourteen states claimed victory in their effort 
to stop visa and mastercard from launching a national debit card 
and one state official hinted the vastly larger credit card market 
could be next on the states antitrust hit list 
visa usa inc and mastercard international agreed to settle 
charges brought by the states in us district court in manhattan 
last june by agreeing to abandon their joint entree debit card 
network the state attorneys general announced tuesday 
each company promised to develop separate debit card systems 
eventually 
a pointofsale debit card is presented at stores like a credit 
card but the money is deducted automatically from the cardholders 
account and transferred to the merchant 
the antitrust suit claimed entree had an unfair advantage over 
smaller regional competitors because virtually every major us 
bank already was a visa or mastercard member 
the credit card associations are the worlds largest with a 
combined 370 million cardholders 
visa and mastercard also have gained control of the nations two 
largest automatic teller machine networks cirrus system inc of 
downers grove ill and plus system inc of denver both of which 
had been formulating their own plans for national debit card 
networks since the early 1980s 
visa also took over the interlink network based in san mateo 
calif the nations largest regional debit card network 
there would have been no competitive forces at work robert 
abrams the new york attorney general who led the states action 
told a news conference the agreement doesnt prevent the concept 
from going forward it prevents a monopoly 
david brancoli a spokesman for visa disagreed we feel the 
program would have been competitive and we would have prevailed in 
the courts 
he said entree was abandoned partly because some banks had begun 
to lose interest in it in the face of what could have been a 
lengthy court battle 
the other states involved in the suit were arizona california 
connecticut louisiana maryland massachusetts minnesota 
tennessee texas utah washington west virginia and wisconsin 
at the end of 1989 there were 1839 million debit cards in 
circulation nationwide according to bankcard holders of america a 
consumer group based in herndon va but not all those cards 
operate online as entree would have by electronically 
accessing a comsumers bank account the same way as an automatic 
teller machine 
visa and mastercard began developing entree in 1986 and had 
signed up about 200 banks to participate according to richard 
woods a spokesman for mastercard two of those banks bank one of 
columbus ohio and us national bank of oregon already had 
issued around 100000 cards although none has been used he said 
under terms of the settlement signed tuesday by us district 
judge pierre n laval in manhattan visa and mastercard will 
abandon entree and notify bank participants it will be terminated 
by oct 1 in exchange the states dropped efforts to compel visa 
and mastercard to divest cirrus plus and interlink 
the speedy resolution of this complex lawsuit is the first 
important step in establishing a more competitive environment in 
the nations electornic payment systems abrams said 
he said the states agreed to set up a task force to investigate 
competition in that field particularly with credit cards 
although there are approximmatly 20000 financial institutions 
offering plastic debit credit and atm cards the interest rates 
and other fees charged is disturbingly high uniform and 
rigid said abrams 
abrams said visa and mastercard had been engaged in a creeping 
merger that already had resulted in largely uniform pricing in 
the credit card industry average credit card rates which are set 
by banks have hovered around 19 percent in recent years despite 
fluctuations in other interest rates 
david robertson a vice president for the nilson report a bank 
industry newsletter published in santa monica calif predicted 
states eventually will challenge the duality of the creditcard 
industry which allows financial institutions to be members of both 
visa and mastercard 
the competition is done with mirrors said robertson how 
can you be a member of both and remain competitive

the guard is changing at the top of time warner 
inc 
the companys president nicholas j nicholas jr succeeds j 
richard munro today as cochief executive of the media and 
entertainment giant 
the toplevel changes had been widely expected and the 
50yearold nicholas said no major changes are expected because he 
and munro have worked together so closely for years 
this represents continuity not change nicholas said 
the 59yearold munro announced he was stepping down at the 
first annual meeting of time warner shareholders since time inc 
completed its acquisition of warner communications inc earlier 
this year 
munro had been chief executive at time since 1980 and chairman 
since 1986 he shared both titles with warner boss steven j ross 
since time bought a controlling interest in warner and changed its 
name last year 
a onetime sports illustrated publisher munro had said he wanted 
to serve only 10 years as chief executive and the company spelled 
out succession plans when the warner deal was first announced in 
march 1989 
munros contract at time warner entitled him to deferred 
compensation of nearly 43 million if he retired from his posts on 
or before this may 31 
nicholas 50 has been with time since 1964 and president since 
1986 
the future belongs to him and to steve and to the remarkable 
people at time warner i wish you all godspeed munro told 
shareholders and others who filled the 1150seat ziegfeld theater 
for tuesdays 2hour meeting 
ross 62 becomes the companys sole chairman with munros 
retirement plans are for him to share the chief executives post 
for four more years after which he is expected to leave that job 
entirely to nicholas 
time spurned a 122 billion buyout offer from paramount 
communications inc last summer and proceeded with a 14 billion 
purchase of warner the deal completed in january created a world 
leader in magazines books films recorded music tv production 
and cable tv systems 
time never allowed shareholders to vote on the paramount offer 
but there were few complaints expressed tuesday about times 
tactics 
shareholders rejected a proposal which was opposed by 
management calling on time warner to either redeem or submit to a 
shareholder vote a key antitakeover defense known as a poison pill 
william steiner who presented the resolution said time 
management had cost its shareholders about 5 billion by rejecting 
paramounts 200ashare offer without allowing a vote 
about 43 percent of the shares voted in favor of the proposal 
and 578 percent against the company said 
in trading tuesday on the new york stock exchange time warner 
stock fell 50 cents a share to 94 
ross said uncertainty about congressional efforts to impose more 
regulations on the cable industry had cut the value of time warner 
stock by 25 billion to 3 billion time warner is the nations 
second biggest cable tv system operator 
one shareholder asked ross to explain why he deserved his 
lucrative benefits package under which he is entitled to deferred 
compensation of about 122 million 
ross said the package mainly reflected stock bonuses and stock 
appreciation rights he was granted in 1987 at warner and noted the 
company he founded had grown at a remarkable pace in recent years 
munro who will stay on as a time warner director and chairman 
of its executive committee joined the time magazine circulation 
department in 1957 
he became president and chief executive of time inc in 1980 
and took on the title of chairman in 1986 passing the presidents 
job to nicholas 
munro defended the decision to combine with warner rather than 
take the paramount offer saying the new company offered a 
potential longterm return on investments that would far outstrip 
any single shortterm gain the sale or breakup of time might 
bring 
time warner lost 256 million on revenue of 108 billion last 
year mainly because of costs associated with its purchase of a 
majority stake in warner nicholas said a top priority is reducing 
the companys 108 billion debt

lin broadcasting corp has amended its 19 
billion offer for metromedia cos stake in the new york city 
cellular telephone franchise to a combination of cash and stock 
instead of an allcash deal 
the new deal announced tuesday will ease the debt burden on lin 
and indirectly on parent mccaw cellular communications inc as it 
takes control of a system in a premiere market 
mccaw took on a heavy debt in march when it paid 34 billion to 
boost its stake in lin to 52 percent 
the new deal increases lins financial flexibility as we move 
ahead with the development of the nationwide seamless cellular 
network said craig o mccaw chairman and chief executive of 
both lin and mccaw cellular 
in a related transaction lin said tuesday it had agreed to give 
metromedia control of the philadelphia cellular franchise by 
selling a fraction of its interest in that system to metromedia for 
155 million 
metromedia based in secaucus nj has interests in 
telecommunications and other activities and is headed by 
billionaire john kluge 
there had been speculation lin was having trouble raising the 
cash needed to buy metromedias stake in the new york franchise 
metro one it agreed to buy the interest two months before agreeing 
to be acquired by the kirkland washbased mccaw 
lin said metromedia has agreed to accept 105 billion in cash 
and 850 million in preferred stock rather than the 19 billion in 
cash originally offered for metromedias 463 percent interest in 
the new york system 
lin already owns a 45 percent of metro one 
metromedia will be given preferred stock in a new lin 
subsidiary lch cellular inc the new unit will own all of lins 
cellular businesses lins specialty publishing operation called 
guestinformant which produces city guides for hotel rooms and one 
of lins seven tv stations wotv which serves the grand 
rapidskalamazoobattle creek area in michigan 
the preferred stock will provide dividends to metromedia and 
will entitle metromedia to representation on the lch cellular board 
in a separate deal disclosed tuesday lin said it had agreed to 
buy another 17 percent stake in the metro one franchise from other 
investors for 60 million that purchase combined with the 
metromedia deal would boost lins stake to 93 percent of the new 
york franchise 
in the transaction involving the philadelphia metrophone 
franchise lin agreed to sell a 101 percent stake in that system 
to metromedia for 155 million at the same time that metromedia 
gets the preferred stock in the new york deal that would cut lins 
51 percent stake in the franchise to just under 50 percent while 
boosting metromedias 49 percent stake to over 50 percent 
the transactions are expected to close in the third quarter of 
the year and are subject to several conditions including regulatory 
approvals and approval by lins independent directors the company 
said 
if the conditions are not met lin said it will proceed with 
completion of the purchase of metromedias new york interests for 
cash

the southland center once dallass premier office 
address has been sold to a swedish investor in the largest deal in 
the citys central business district since the real estate market 
collapsed in the mid1980s 
larserik magnusson chief executive of larmag investments group 
of amsterdam said tuesday he had paid about 60 million for the 
threebuilding downtown complex and would spend another 130 
million to renovate them 
magnusson made the purchase in partnership with kti associates 
another investment firm 
i think dallas has had its worst years behind it magnusson 
said by telephone from his home in the netherlands ive been 
looking at dallas for a couple of years but last year i felt it 
was too early to go in this year i feel much more comfortable 
the largest building the 42story southland tower was the 
tallest in dallas when it was completed in 1959 by southland 
financial corp its companion 31story skyway tower was finished in 
1981 the office buildings have about 1 million square feet of 
leasable space but are only 30 percent occupied 
the 508room 29story sheraton dallas hotel completes the 
complex 
the collapse of the local real estate market in the 1980s left 
many skyscrapers almost vacant and sent rental rates plummeting 
boosters welcomed the deal as the latest indication of a 
recovery but some said the deals success depends on the 
refurbishing magnusson said he planned to replace the 
turquoisetile and florescentlight facade derided by locals as 
well as remove asbestos 
the recladding could dramatically increase the appeal of 
that building if they can do all that work and can get acceptance 
by the public as a new project rather than just a rehashing of the 
old project said bob edge executive vice president of cushman amp 
wakefield of texas inc real estate firm 
but edge said theyre going to have do one heck a job of 
retrofitting that building to get that kind of acceptance 
magnusson whose personal worth has been estimated at about 200 
million said he planned to begin work by the end of the year with 
completion during 1992 
i think that the lease market in dallas will be tighter in the 
next 18 months and that gives me just the time i need to 
renovate he said im sure i can deliver top class buildings 
the purchase is another piece of the recovery said larry 
fonts president of the central dallas association a downtown 
business group it is a big deal 
magnusson who has invested more than 2 billion in europe is a 
relative newcomer to us real estate paying 630 million last 
year for three trophy properties in new york and chicago 
the center once was the headquarters for southland life 
insurance co later a subsidiary of southland financial an 
insurance company owned by dallas carpenter family 
the life insurance company was sold in 1984 and the office 
complex followed in 1988 in a deal with ashton development corp a 
partnership owned by saudi arabian investors and new york investor

according to the complaint garvy bought 5500 shares in the 
investment trust before the tender offer was made public 
the complaint also charged that garvy told his father eugene 
70 of hinsdale ill and a friend betsy perk 29 of chicago 
about the pending deal and they purchased shares in the saul trust 
the complaint does not accuse the elder saul garvys father or 
ms perk of any wrongdoing 
rogers the younger sauls lawyer said he was surprised the sec 
was bringing the case despite a federal appeals court decision in 
new york last week that overturned an insider trading case in which 
a broker received merger information from a client whose family 
owned the company in question 
sometimes people have to be told twice no ones ever accused 
the government of being smart said robert stephenson garvys 
attorney in chicago he said his client also denied the charges and 
would seek a quick trial 
the sec charged that garvy his father and ms perk made a total 
of 61000 in profits using the information supplied by the younger 
saul 
the sec is seeking from both garvy and the younger saul who was 
not accused of trading for himself a total of three times the 
total illegal profits or 183000 in penalties

after months of hinting at its position the 
bush administration is siding with the securities and exchange 
commission in its jurisdictional dispute with futures regulators 
treasury undersecretary robert glauber told a senate panel 
tuesday that the administration will introduce legislation to strip 
the commodity futures trading commission of control over 
stockindex futures and hand it to the sec 
the announcement marks a victory for the sec which regulates 
the nations stock markets in a turf battle with the rival cftc 
which oversees futures markets 
the dispute centers on which agency should oversee financial 
products that have elements of both a security and a futures 
contract these socalled hybrid products include stockindex 
futures 
in testimony before the senate agriculture committee which 
oversees the cftc glauber said the administration wants the sec to 
have authority over all stockrelated products including 
stockindex futures and stockindex options 
sen patrick leahy the committee chairman said he would ask 
the leadership to bring the matter to the senate floor for action 
he did so after berating both the sec and cftc for their 
increasingly combative rhetoric and complaining that the measure 
might delay muchneeded futures market reform 
reaction from the futures exchanges was swift and predictable 
in chicago thomas r donovan chairman of the chicago board of 
trade said the proposal would solve a perceived problem only to 
create a very real one by placing futures markets under two 
regulators 
the proposal is clearly just the first step of creeping 
regulatory imperialism he added in a lengthy statement released 
by the cbot 
such a move could serve to endanger our nations number one 
status in the world in financial services said leo melamed 
chairman of the chicago mercantile exchanges executive committee 
that is a risk that congress ought not take he said in a 
statement 
john damgard president of the futures industry association who 
sat in on the hearing said therell be no jurisdictional change 
this year but it sure mucks up the reauthorization scene which i 
think everybody will agree is unfortunate 
in his opening remarks leahy complained the dispute has held up 
passage of a bill that adds several market reform measures to the 
cftcs reauthorization legislation 
congress remains blocked from enacting the tough reforms we 
all agreed are needed the vermont democrat said 
leahy also said the committee should consider responsible 
appropriate solutions possibly even the ultimate merger of the 
sec and cftc if this is shown to be justified and feasible 
cftc chairman wendy gramm told the committee a change in 
jurisdiction could cripple her agency 
splitting off stock index or financial futures from the cftc 
would result in the loss of some of our most experienced personnel 
which could damage agency morale and threaten our ability to 
oversee the remaining markets within our jursidiction she said 
in addition to glauber and gramm federal reserve board chairman 
alan greenspan and sec chairman richard breeden also testified 
before the committee the four witnesses sit on the white house 
working group on financial markets which was set up in the wake of 
the 1987 stock market crash to handle intermarket issues

pan american corp chairman thomas plaskett says 
the company is still looking for partners as it comes off one of 
the worst years in its 62year history 
pan am which failed in a bid last year to buy northwest 
airlines wants to strengthen its route network and has talked to 
nearly every other major carrier about some form of combination 
ranging from joint marketing to fullscale mergers plaskett said 
we are looking at every conceivable idea but as for now we 
dont have an agreement with anyone plaskett said during 
tuesdays annual shareholders meeting 
in a meeting repeatedly disrupted by protesting teamster union 
employees plaskett said pan am would begin reducing losses this 
year but he cautioned that the carrier was on a long slow route 
to recovery 
although plaskett said the company needs capital company 
officials said there are no plans to sell pan ams northeast 
shuttle service as eastern airlines sold its northeast shuttle 
last year to new york developer donald trump 
pan am has not made a profit since 1980 pan american world 
airways its major subsidiary posted a 4371 million net loss in 
1989 compared to 1183 million in losses in 1988 pan am corp 
lost 190 million the first quarter of this year 
hundreds of pan ams nearly 5000 teamstersrepresented 
employees demonstrated outside the hotel intercontinental then 
jammed into the shareholders meeting most employees hold shares 
because of past stockwage programs 
plaskett was interrupted repeatedly as he opened his annual 
report including when he discussed the financial losses resulting 
from the december 1988 terrorist bombing of pan ams flight 103 
over lockerbie scotland which killed all 259 on board and 11 
people on the ground 
i find it incomprehensible that a tragedy like this would 
engender jeers and guffaws plaskett snapped 
the teamsters representing reservations ticket computer and 
cargo agents have been working under companyimposed conditions 
for two years since federal mediation failed starting wages for 
most jobs are under 6 an hour and some are at 1978 levels the 
union said 
jack barmon chief steward of teamsters local 769 said the 
union hasnt struck because it fears members would never get their 
jobs back tuesday marked the beginning of sporadic work stoppages 
he said 
pan am spokeswoman pamela hanlon said a small number of 
employees failed to report to work on time tuesday but their 
duties were covered by management personnel with no effect on 
operations 
she said the rowdy protests were basically what we expected 
because of the big presence of employees in miami 
plaskett said pan am is concentrating on improving and marketing 
its customer service reputation increasing business to europe 
including eastern europe and the soviet union and expanding its 
pan am express as a feeder service 
in miami he said pan am is up to 60 departures daily from 45 
last year making pan am the leading carrier out of the city it 
aims to have 150 to 180 daily flights here by 1995 along with 
13000 employees compared to 6900 now 
pan am is hoping to capitalize on miamis growth and the woes of 
miamibased eastern airlines eastern still is struggling to emerge 
from chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization and is basing its future 
on its atlanta hub eastern is down to 48 daily miami departures 
from 110 when its union workers walked out march 4 1989 
by midsummer easterns south american routes will be taken 
over by american airlines

once shunned by foreignlanguage students german 
is making a comeback at some schools thanks to the fall of the 
berlin wall and the move to reunifying the two germanys educators 
say 
though german still takes a backseat to spanish and french at 
most high schools and colleges students are becoming increasingly 
aware of its value as a possible career tool said helmut ziesle 
president of the northern illinois chapter of the american 
association of teachers of german and a professor at suburban 
wheaton college 
theres been a 30 percent increase this year in the number of 
wheaton students majoring in german he said 
once germanys united its economic role will become more 
important ziesle said in a telephone interview tuesday 
the more we are aware here how important that is the more 
interest we stimulate in the study of german i think it will help 
both countries tremendously he said most germans know 
english but relativley few americans know german 
at south suburban homewoodflossmoor high school the expected 
enrollment in firstyear german will be 19 next year up from 12 
this year said principal charles smith 
the illinois math and science academy in aurora will add a 
second section of firstyear german next year said teacher john 
stark 
and the chicago public school systems german language summer 
camp in suburban lake forest is filled up with 20 students said 
david oliver coordinator of the department of language and 
cultural education for the chicago board of education 
its way over what we expected he said last year we had 
a problem getting more than eight students 
i think its based on whats taking place in germany oliver 
said i think theres a whole new spirit 
before world war i german was the most popular foreign language 
in american schools both world wars and especially nazi germany 
helped change that ziesle said 
so did the growth in the number of hispanic immigrants in this 
country which helped give spanish topbilling said sherry 
parriott president of the southern illinois chapter of the german 
teachers association 
in 1985 the most recent statistics available about 4 million 
high school and college students were taking spanish about 15 
million were taking french and about 500000 german said helene 
zimmerloew executive director of the association the cherry 
hill njbased group has about 6500 members mostly high school 
and college teachers 
the news ive heard from most colleges and universities is 
that theres been a greater request for german courses ms 
zimmerloew said

americas blackowned businesses slumped notably 
last year and must get leaner stronger better to cope with 
big debt burdens and a less favorable stance by the government 
black enterprise magazine reported 
hit by the sluggish economy the nations biggest blackowned 
businesses saw employment fall sharply and sales decline last year 
the magazine said tuesday 
in its annual tally of the biggest blackowned us businesses 
the magazine said the coming years posed even more hurdles because 
of cutbacks in areas such as defense spending and what it deemed 
weakening government commitments to affirmative action and minority 
aid programs 
black entrepreneurs will have to rethink their strategic focus 
and restructure their organizations if they are to keep their 
competitive edge and reap profits from the ensuing chaos said 
earl g graves editor and publisher in other words black 
business is going to have to get leaner stronger better 
among the 100 biggest industrial and service companies 
employment fell by 104 percent while sales dropped 38 percent to 
446 billion the magazine stated 
for the 100 biggest blackowned auto dealerships which are 
listed separately sales rose by 84 percent to 233 billion but 
total staff dropped 13 percent reflecting the slowdown in the 
nations auto industry 
nineteen of the biggest companies from 1988 twothirds of them 
auto dealerhips sought bankruptcy court protection from creditors 
during the year 
retaining the top spot among industrial and service companies 
was tlc beatrice international holdings co the foods processor 
and distributor the new yorkbased holding company acquired the 
international food businesses of the former beatrice cos in a 
debtfinanced 985 million buyout in 1987 
tlc beatrices gross sales of 151 billion accounted for about 
a third of the total sales of the be 100 biggest industrial and 
service companies 
but like many of the other companies tlc beatrice suffered from 
weak conditions in the economy and financial markets a planned 
public offering of 35 percent of the company which would have made 
tlc beatrice the first blackowned company on the new york stock 
exchange was withdrawn in december due to a sagging stock market 
and a weak reception by investors 
in short be 100s companies like much of american industry 
are paying for the excesses of the 1980s the magazine stated 
debtridden and immurred in cyclical industries many be 100s 
companies realize that the flush times are over or at least 
stalled 
not only will black businesses have to confront an economy 
chugging at a much slower pace but they must profit as national 
state and local government agencies begin to reregulate sagging 
industries and develop an increasingly laissez faire attitude about 
affirmative action and minority setasides the magazine said 
johnson publishing co inc of chicago the publisher 
broadcaster and maker of cosmetics and haircare products retained 
second place on the list with 2413 million in revenue 
j bruce llewellyns philadelphia cocacola bottling co inc 
the soft drink bottler kept third place with 240 million in 
sales 
hj russell amp co of atlanta involved in construction 
property management and food and beverages held fourth place 
although its revenue of 1329 million was down 168 percent from 
the previous year 
ranked fifth again was gordy co the former motown industries 
inc with sales of 100 million 
computer and office supply companies accounted for 18 of the 
biggest 100 industrial and service businesses followed by 17 
manufacturing companies 16 food and beverage companies and 10 
media companies 
california led all states with 23 of the companies belonging to 
one or the other of the two top100 lists michigan had 22 
followed by new york with 19 illinois with 17 ohio with 13 and 
texas with 11

a federal jury has found that ford motor co 
didnt intentionally infringe on an inventors patent rights to his 
intermittent windshield wiper 
however the partial verdict decided on tuesday still means 
robert w kearns could collect a considerable amount of money said 
cincinnati patent lawyer jim hayes 
it does not alleviate the jurys initial ruling but it does 
mean that he will collect less hayes said 
the us district court panel adjourned after releasing its 
partial verdict in the claims by kearns and was scheduled to begin 
a sixth day of deliberations today to decide how much money the 
inventor should receive 
the same jury on jan 29 ruled that ford had violated the patent 
held by kearns a former wayne state university professor who now 
lives in gaithersburg md 
kearns claims in his 12yearold suit against ford that he 
installed a set of his wipers on a 1962 ford and took it to the 
automaker he said he believed that ford would buy his system since 
engineers questioned him at length about it 
kearns 62 also is suing general motors corp chrysler corp 
honda motor co ltd and a dozen other automakers and autorelated 
companies the case against ford was the first to go to trial 
after the jurys january decision judge avern cohn issued an 
order forbidding kearns or ford officials from talking about the 
case

british aerospace and aerospatiale of france said 
wednesday they will conduct a fiveyear study to decide whether to 
develop a new supersonic airliner to replace their jointly produced 
concorde 
a final decision on whether to proceed with a 10 billion 
production program would be made in 1995 aerospatiale president 
henri martre told a news conference 
he said the feasibility study would cost about 34 million and 
focus on such issues as market potential technical factors and 
environmental protection 
martre said the british and french companies would welcome 
cooperation with other industrial powers including the united 
states soviet union west germany and japan 
british airways and air france together operate 13 concordes on 
transatlantic routes these planes are due for retirement within 
15 to 20 years and the new planes if developed would be ready by 
about 2005

japan with some of the most expensive real estate 
in the world could suffer economic problems if land prices fall as 
history indicates they might the bank of japan said wednesday 
experiences abroad suggest that it is important to forestall 
any turbulence which might arise from a sudden change in land 
prices in order to maintain a safe and sound financial system 
the central bank said in a report 
land prices in tokyo jumped 238 percent in 1987 and 653 
percent in 1988 before the increase slowed to less than 2 percent 
last year according to the national land agency 
nationwide land prices soared 17 percent in 1989 after a 217 
rise in 1988 as speculative inflation spread to other japanese 
cities 
the most expensive commercial property in the world in central 
tokyos marunouchi and ginza business districts was valued at 
23700 a square foot the agency said 
the bank of japan said history shows that it is wrong to assume 
land prices will keep climbing and never decline this assumption 
among corporate and individual investors is driving economic 
decisions and poses a risk to the economy it said 
the bank called for legal and tax reforms to end incentives for 
property speculation and encourage more efficient land use 
meanwhile it said financial institutions should be monitored 
closely to ensure that a drop in land prices doesnt undermine the 
value of the currency 
the scarcity of land is one basic factor behind the high prices 
but more fundamentally institutional factors such as the tax 
and legal systems seem to work to push up land prices by inhibiting 
the more efficient utilization of land the bank of japan said 
it said cases in the united states and britain show that when 
land prices climb steeply over a short period they may decline 
harming financial institutions such as savings and loan firms 
involved in property lending 
a sudden decline in land prices could be triggered by tighter 
monetary policy which raises interest rates as well as changes in 
the economy and legal and tax systems the bank said 
rising prices in other areas have led the bank to raise its 
official discount rate four times in the past year to its current 
525 percent from a historic low of 25 percent the rate is what 
commercial banks pay to borrow from the central bank

volkswagen ag west germanys 
largest automaker reported wednesday that its first quarter profit 
rose 55 percent over last year and that 1989 income grew by a 
record 33 percent 
earnings for the first three months of 1990 totaled 191 
million compared with 181 million last year sales were up 7 
percent to 103 billion worldwide 
volkswagen also disclosed its total net income for 1989 jumped 
by a record 33 percent to 609 million from 475 million in 1988 
sales for 1989 rose 10 percent to 396 billion 36 billion 
it was the first time the company disclosed actual financial 
data for 1989 chairman karl hahn had indicated earlier though 
that net income had risen by more than 30 percent last year 
hahn buoyed by record sales from last year also announced 
tuesday that volkswagen was considering expanding in eastern 
europe just as it plans to grow in east germany 
it would undoubtedly be a mistake if we in a europe with 
nearly 500 million people looked only at east germany with its 16 
million people hahn told a news conference 
hahn said volkswagen was conducting talks in hungary bulgaria 
and czechoslovakia but he did not elaborate 
volkswagen already is arranging joint production with the east 
german carmaker ifakombinat and is shooting for an annual output 
of 250000 units after 1994 hahn said

shedding nicknames like chateau de 
bubba and cowboy cabernet a west texas winery has proven 
beyond a sip of sauvignon that wine from the south plains can get 
some respect even from the french 
this month three labels from llano estacado winerys 
awardwinning stock have begun appearing in 350 restaurants in 
france 
we know llano wines are going to be a success said 
jeanmichel maumont of selected distributors and vintners in 
cognac france at first it will be curiosity but after 
tasting this wine they will realize its quality 
maumont is importing red blush and white wines from llano for 
restaurants sdv already supplies with the makings of southwestern 
cuisine from tecate lone star and carta blanca beers to pinto 
beans picante sauce and taco shells 
the french importer and llano say they hope to capitalize on a 
european craze for texmex cuisine 
maumont sought out llano after the winery won a gold medal at 
the international wine and spirit competition in london last 
october 
the export deal is a coup for a winery that still touts its 
bestselling blush wine as the perfect companion to chicken fried 
steak 
kicking a cowboy image has been tough for the winery says john 
lowey llano president and chief executive officer the operation 
started in 1976 it began commercial production in 1983 and grew 
despite the economic downturn that stalled the growth of some other 
texas wineries 
lowey said west texas has an ideal environment for grape 
growing with a 3200foot elevation and regular daily temperature 
swings of 30 degrees 
in grapevine physiology that causes the wine grapes to build 
sugar as the cooler temperatures help them retain acid he said 
a good sugaracid balance is the secret to a strong vintage 
but he said when we first started we couldnt give a bottle 
of wine away here in lubbock 
we couldnt beg our way onto a wine list in 1982 and 1983 it 
was very difficult to establish any credibility at all 
llanos big break came at the 1986 san francisco fair exposition 
and national wine competition where it snatched a double gold 
medal the highest honor for its 1984 chardonnay 
it was like winning the kentucky derby lowey said 
still us publications dubbed llano products cactus blanc 
and chateau de bubba lowey is happy such stories and names 
have not circulated in europe 
i think we have much more highly developed skepticism in the 
united states than in france he said in europe we are judged 
on our merits 
most frenchmen dont know that wine is made in texas 
maumont said in a telephone interview from sdv headquarters 
llano produces a very good wine he said i found other 
texas wines that disappointed me greatly its certainly one of the 
best wines of texas 
maumont contends llanos cabernet sauvignon the winerys 
trademark will satisfy the most discriminating french palates 
its style is a little different he said the texas 
bordeaux has a more complex aroma it has a taste that is quite 
extraordinary 
french customers will get to try three llano wines a 1987 
cabernet sauvignon 1989 red and 1989 blush 
llano which sells 95 percent of its wine in texas recently 
completed another transatlantic deal to stock 300 to 400 cases of 
cabernet and chardonnay in a chain of wine boutiques throughout the 
united kingdom international distiller and vinters hunter and 
oliver wine shops will carry the llano stock within a few months 
lowey said 
llanos success at home and abroad has been helped by its 
relatively low prices llanos 14 labels range from 5 to 25 for 
the topoftheline sauvignon that allows european dealers to 
cover their shipping costs and still make a profit lowey said 
he doesnt know how much his wines will cost in france but said 
theyll be expensive 
llanos french debut a may 21 tasting at the american embassy 
in paris expands a connection between the lone star state and the 
french wine industry that began almost 100 years ago 
in the 1890s the disease phylloxera which kills the 
grapevines root was decimating french vineyards 
texas horticulturist tv munson developed a diseaseresistant 
rootstock and sent it to france munson was credited with saving 
the french wine industry and officially recognized by the french 
government 
there is a real knowledge that we owe texas greatly for this 
help maumont said

the us dollar fell against other major 
currencies in europe on wednesday hit initially by a rush of 
japanese selling and later by general bearishness over the american 
currencys prospects 
gold prices ended the day narrowly lower 
foreign exchange dealers linked early european pressure on the 
dollar to continued japanese interest in selling dollars for swiss 
francs 
dealers said some technical selling also was kicked off when the 
dollar moved below the important support levels of 1655 west 
german marks and 157 japanese yen 
the sentiment is antidollar at the moment said laudy bahl 
head corporate dealer for the bank of tokyo in london 
she said the japanese selling and later broaderbased selling 
when the us markets opened were exerting significant pressure on 
the dollar 
a dealer at a large european bank in frankfurt cited the 
possibility of a weakening us economy and the potential for 
interest rate cuts there as a factor in the dollars decline 
analysts have pointed to the april us employment report 
released friday which showed lower job growth that month than 
economists anticipated 
in tokyo the dollar closed at 15703 yen down 102 yen from 
tuesdays close later in london the dollar was quoted lower at 
15640 yen 
the british pound cost 16785 in london more expensive than 
16697 late tuesday 
other dollar rates in europe compared with late tuesday 
included 16375 west german marks down from 16580 14039 swiss 
francs down from 14332 55010 french francs down from 55710

jordan announced wednesday that it had 
received a 20 million grant from the united arab emirates and said 
more arab aid was expected to help overcome a financial crisis 
jordan has relied on oilrich arab states as its primary 
financial donor a shortfall of previously pledged arab aid to 
jordan has led to a decline in foreign currency reserves the 
countrys foreign debt totaled 83 billion at the end of 1988 
as a result of the debt burden jordan in november 1988 
introduced an economic adjustment program and sought international 
creditors help to reschedule its debts 
central bank governor mohammad said nabulsi said wednesday he 
was unhappy with an initial draft agreement with creditors in 
london for finalizing a 580 million rescheduling package 
he said the banks foreign currency reserves totaled 390 
million including the new aid received up from a 200 million 
deficit last year reserves hit bottom around april 1989 when the 
country sustained four days of rioting sparked by economic problems 
nabulsi said the latest total does not include additional arab 
central banks deposits totaling 100 million considered as second 
line reserves for the next five years 
nabulsi said the expected arab aid will not exceed 400 million 
he said that finalizing the 580 million rescheduling package 
with the london club a committee of six bank creditors was 
expected later this month jordans total debt to the group is 11 
billion he said 
nablusi said that by the end of 1990 remittances from jordanian 
expatriates were expected to increase to 800 million compared to 
650 million in 1989 
jordan with a population of 31 million also depends on an 
estimated 350000 jordanians working in the oilrich gulf countries 
who bring millions of dollars home in 1987 remittances totaled 1 
billion

grain and soybean futures prices were mostly 
higher wednesday on the chicago board of trade as a surge of buying 
by professional funds boosted soybeans 
the strength of soybeans was surprising in that no new 
features presented themselves to the market said rich feltes an 
analyst with refco inc 
feltes noted that export sales from the united states remain 
weak while brazilian exports on a weektoweek basis are strong 
i think we have a market that is looking at factors not 
immediately apparent he said 
the strength of soybean futures spilled over into the corn 
market which also received a boost from continued strong export 
business feltes said the strength shown by the livestock market 
also provided a boost to corn prices 
wheat futures were relatively weak with trading light in 
anticipation of the release thursday of the us ariculture 
department crop report estimating the winter wheat crop 
feltes said the failure of a bid by the soviet union to purchase 
550000 metric tons of wheat under an export bonus program had 
little effect on wheat prices he said traders expect the sale to 
be approved eventually 
at the close wheat was 1 cent lower to 3 cents higher with the 
contract for may delivery at 381 a bushel corn was cent to 3 
cents higher with may at 290 a bushel oats were 1 cent to 2 
cents lower with may at 165 a bushel soybeans were 12 cents to 
13 cents higher with may at 646 a bushel

membersonly warehouse clubs introduced more 
than a decade ago to allow buyers to purchase office food and 
household goods in bulk have emerged as the retail industrys 
fastest growing sector 
sales at the estimated 600 clubs nationwide which target small 
businesses churches and nonprofit groups with the lure of 
wholesale purchases previously available only to large companies 
are projected to reach 25 billion this year a tenfold increase 
over 1984 
it took about five years for people to realize the concept was 
viable said arthur markowitz senior editor of the trade 
publication discount store news which has monitored the growth of 
clubs its a discount store for businessmen 
for an annual fee of about 25 club members are offered goods 
ranging from peanut butter to fax machines in large buildings that 
look more like construction warehouses than retail outlets 
the draw of the nofrills clubs industry officials say is that 
small businesses can save by buying goods at near wholesale prices 
for that reason the glitter of regular department store chains is 
unneeded and unwanted 
our member is a very intelligent consumer said john f 
geisse founder and chief executive of indianapolisbased wholesale 
club which operates 24 warehouses in the midwest youd better 
have the right item at the right time the best price and make sure 
its presented properly 
finding the right way to present the clubs to the target 
consumer was a matter of finetuning particularly in the midwest 
where geisse was working 
it was rather rough in the early years he said we opened 
west allis in suburban milwaukee and had a fabulous grand 
opening but people didnt come back i dont think we did our 
homework well this was only our third unit 
that was in 1984 when industry sales nationwide were about 24 
billion for 79 warehouses according to discount store news geisse 
said defining the products for small businesses was the key to 
overcoming three profitless years and opening 21 new warehouses 
since 1984 
discount store news estimates the warehouse clubs are the 
fastest growing sector of the retail industry with annual sales 
increases ranging from 140 percent to 26 percent over the last five 
years sales advances in other areas of retailing have been much 
more modest 
stephen mandel a securities analyst with new yorkbased 
investment bank goldman sachs and co agreed with the warehouse 
clubs emerging prominence in the retail industry he said small 
business owners churches and nonprofit organizations attacted by 
prices typically 9 percent over manufacturers cost are fueling the 
growth 
what makes the warehouse clubs stand out even more is the 
trouble that other parts of the retail business have been facing 
recently because of large debts rapid expansion and overly 
optimistic forecasts of aggressive spending by consumers who now 
seem to be holding back because of economic uncertainty 
some of the swankest department stores such as bloomingdales 
and jordan marsh now operate under bankruptcycourt protection 
because of parent company financial crises even a few big 
discounters have sought bankruptcy refuge most notably the ames 
department stores inc chain last month 
unlike discount stores which offer about 50000 items 
warehouse clubs sell only about 4000 items specific to small 
business needs at near wholesale prices markowitz said 
also unlike other retailers that operate on profit margins of 
more than 20 percent membership warehouse clubs operate on a 10 
percent profit margin because they offer a limited assortment of 
fast turning items markowitz said 
the clubs carry staple items and basic office supplies like 
sugar and copier paper on a regular basis but beyond that members 
dont know what they might find on any given visit 
the whole concept of buying is different said cathy roper 
community relations manager for the pace warehouse chain based in 
aurora colo were able to negotiate some bulktype deals with 
our vendors unlike a retailer that will get the same items again 
and again 
the clubs combine wholesale and retail by buying items for 
business use in bulk and carrying a few fastturning consumer items 
for their customers personal use like dress shirts and 
electronics markowitz said 
if an item moves slowly the club wont carry it again he said 
thats the only thing that matters to them if it sells he 
said since theyre not locked into anything they can go into 
wherever they can sell merchandise 
the clubs also keep costs low by avoiding members whose checks 
might not always clear and by refusing to accept credit cards if 
theres a margin of only 10 percent they cant afford to pay two 
or three percent of that to visa or mastercard markowitz said 
the clubs were introduced in the united states in 1976 when the 
price co opened its first price club in san diego the company now 
has 48 warehouses nationwide said giles bateman vice chairman 
price cos founder sol price got the idea for the warehouses 
from huge cashandcarry stores popular in europe markowitz 
said 
the price club began expanding rapidly after the first unit but 
other companies didnt seize the market for several years 
markowitz said 
pace entered the industry in 1982 and now has 54 stores in 15 
states ms roper said adding the companys expansion has not 
slowed 
discount store news projects continued growth for the entire 
industry markowitz said states in the northeast hold extraordinary 
potential 
in california in the los angeles market you have about 30 
stores he said but in the 1012state northeast region in 
the entire market they only have about 30 stores theres still a 
lot of growth because theres still a lot of areas where there 
arent many of them

united states following former president reagans 1985 trade 
embargo sending a shipload of sugar from the port of corinto

sandinista government president bush lifted it after 
americanbacked violetta chamorro de barrios won the presidency in 
february elections 
nicaragua shipped 18000 metric tons of sugar on tuesday part 
of the 54328 metric tons nicaragua can sell to the united states

export crop to soviet bloc nations 
despite tense diplomatic relations the united states remained 
the biggest buyer of nicaraguan goods until the embargo was imposed 
the us embassy which announced the shipment said the bush 
administration is considering a series of steps to reduce 
barriers and tariffs and open the market to nicaraguan exports 
other exports include cotton tobacco beef and seafood

a group of drexel burnham lambert group inc 
creditors asked a federal judge wednesday to place a commodities 
trading subsidiary into bankruptcy court because it is not paying 
more than 500 million in debts 
the move by several large foreign central banks and other 
creditors would toss drexel burnham lambert trading corpinto 
involuntary chapter 7 liquidation proceedings removing the company 
from control of its parent 
drexel said in a statement it would not challenge the petition 
but would exercise the right to convert it to a chapter 11 case 
which allows a company to reorganize its assets and business under 
protection from creditors 
the petition was filed in us bankruptcy court in manhattan 
where the parent of the wall street firm sought protection from 
creditors on feb 13 after a cash crunch and continued problems 
from its 1989 securities fraud guilty plea 
drexel burnham lambert inc the brokerage subsidiary is 
liquidating its assets outside of bankruptcy court creditors were 
said to be considering whether to place the firm in involuntary 
liquidation where its actions would be controlled by the court 
the bankruptcy petition filing by the commodities subsidiary was 
made by creditors banco de portugal the national bank of 
yugoslavia nissho iwai corp a japanese trading concern and 
ultramar energy ltd an oil trading company in tarrytown a new 
york suburb 
the commodities subsidiary owes those and several dozen other 
creditors between 500 million and 550 million said barry 
dichter an attorney for banco de portugal 
dbl tradings largest asset is a 645 million claim against the 
parent company for money that was funneled to the parent before it 
filed for chapter 11 protection under the us bankruptcy code 
dichter said 
drexel said the commodities trading subsidiary has estimated net 
liabilities of 505 million while its claim against the parent 
company is about 558 million 
dbl trading indicated that the amounts recoverable from group 
represent the balance of loans and advances made to dbl group in 
line with similar transactions dating back over a number of 
years the statement said 
the commodities subsidiary based in fort lee nj traded in 
oil precious metals and foreign exchange it has ceased 
operations attorneys said it had resolved its trading positions 
except for several involving the future delivery of gold from 
foreign mining companies 
the creditors believe that their future is tied to exercising 
control over the matter dichter said basically it was a 
rudderless ship on which we were all passengers and we wanted to 
steer the vessel 
he said dbl tradings employees including senior officers had 
left the subsidiary and the parent company was controlling its 
destiny which he called much like having the fox to guard the 
chicken coop 
we had no confidence the claim would be actively pursued for 
the benefit of tradings creditors dichter said we feared the 
claim would be dealt with for groups benefit 
the hundreds of millions of dollars owed by drexel to the 
subsidiary involves precious metals such as gold and platinum that 
were leased from central banks of various governments a common 
trading practice 
the metals then were used in other transactions that generated 
cash for the commodities trading subsidiary that money then was 
upstreamed into the parent company which was short on cash 
under the filing dichter said the subsidiarys creditors would 
retain an independent consultant to examine the relationship 
between the subsidiary and parent and make recommendations on how 
it should resolve its liabilities 
drexel still would control the company with oversight by 
creditors and us bankruptcy judge howard c buschman iii in a 
chapter 7 case a trustee is appointed who must collect and 
liquidate all property of the debtors estate and investigate any 
claims made by creditors 
lawyers said nissho iwai is owed about 160 million portugals 
central bank 95 million to 120 million yugoslavias central bank 
about 70 million and ultramar energy 11 million

crude oil and gasoline prices rallied wednesday 
as several news developments raised the possibility that supplies 
of both fuels could be tighter in the near future 
the june contract for delivery of west texas intermediate the 
benchmark grade of us crude rose 71 cents a 42gallon barrel 
closing at 1899 on the new york mercantile exchange 
the market moved higher on reports that saudi arabia was 
exploring ways of cutting its oil production said andrew lebow an 
analyst with edampf man international futures inc 
the prospect of reduced output by the largest member of the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries raised hopes that the 
glut of oil on world markets which has depressed the price of 
crude this year might abate 
a job action by oil workers and a gas leak in the north sea 
raised further concerns about the nearterm supply of crude lebow 
said 
unleaded regular gasoline for june delivery advanced 149 cents 
a gallon to 6397 cents on the nymex 
supply concerns also dominated trading in gasoline as a pipeline 
in the gulf of mexico remained shut analysts said 
the pipeline which serves 36 six drilling platforms and handles 
95000 barrels a day might cause supply disruptions to refineries 
just as they are preparing to process large09 0025

greyhound lines inc the target of a lengthy 
oftenviolent strike said wednesday it was cutting its weekday 
fares in half for two weeks beginning may 14 in an effort to lure 
back riders 
this is a business that is based on trial and then high 
repeat usage said ralph borland greyhound marketing vice 
president we want to induce them to ride and to see that the bus 
line is unencumbered 
while the promotion could mean less cash in the short term 
were in this for the long term borland said 
greyhound bus drivers walked out march 2 in a dispute over wages 
and job security but the company immediately began replacing them 
with new drivers and crossovers the strike has been marked by 
violence with buses in a number of locations hit by gunfire 
greyhound chairman fred g currey said monday that the company 
which operates the only nationwide bus system now has enough 
drivers to run at or near prestrike levels 
currey said greyhound is serving markets which provided 98 
percent of its revenue last year although ridership and revenue 
hovered around 70 percent of yearago levels not quite enough to 
meet expenses 
greyhound is offering halfprice tickets for travel monday 
through thursday in the two weeks beginning may 14 the company 
also is offering mothers day fares of 1 for travel of up to 500 
miles on sunday to mothers 18 or older 
borland said he had no projections of the fare cuts impact on 
ridership 
analysts have expressed doubts greyhound has enough cash to 
operate for the long term but company spokesman george gravley 
said we have the capacity here to run things in a reasonable 
way 
the strike has cost greyhound more than it anticipated and 
helped give the company 558 million in first quarter losses in a 
move to preserve operating funds greyhound last week said it would 
not make a 975 million interest payment due tuesday and had not 
made about 5 million in lease payments due in april 
although the missed payments open the door for creditors to take 
action to force the company into bankruptcy currey says he 
believes they will give him time to rebuild the company 
reclaiming passengers is a key to that recovery 
the typical greyhound passenger rides several times a year 
gravley said if they take one trip they generally take a lot of 
trips our job is to get them to take that first trip and then 
treat em right

energy futures prices surged wednesday on the new york 
mercantile exchange amid concerns that gasoline and crude oil 
inventories would be tight in the near term 
on other markets grains and soybeans were mostly higher 
precious metals futures gained slightly copper prices advanced and 
livestock and pork prices gained 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent to 71 cents 
higher with the contract for june delivery at 1899 a barrel 
heating oil was 11 cents lower to 6 cents higher with june at 5134 
cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 020 cent to 149 cents 
higher with june at 6397 cents a gallon 
gasoline futures advanced on good cash buying on the gulf coast 
said jerry samuels an analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc in 
new york 
prices also were boosted by american petroleum institute figures 
that showed a drawdown of nearly 1 million barrels of unleaded 
gasoline the figures indicated the drop of gasoline stocks had a 
particularly large impact on the gulf coast region where prices 
are higher than those on the mercantile exchange 
the institute also reported a drop in gasoline output by us 
refineries samuels attributed the decline to maintenance work at 
the refineries 
crude oil futures also rose on supply concerns as labor 
problems and a gas leak in the north sea raised the possibility of 
reduced output there and as saudi arabia was reportedly seeking 
ways to curb its production 
fears of tight supplies and high open interest in contracts 
about to expire sent copper futures soaring on new yorks commodity 
exchange 
adding to the surge was increased labor tension in peru and new 
guinea 
in peru where a labor dispute at the southern peru copper corp 
was recently settled workers at the centromin mines are 
threatening to strike as are workers at the oktedi mines in new 
guinea 
meanwhile labor talks were under way at several north american 
copper mines 
copper was 4 cents to 535 cents higher with may at 1244 a 
pound 
precious metals futures were higher on the comex as the value of 
the dollar fell in relation to foreign currencies 
gold had difficulty getting on the plus side in early trading on 
rumors the soviet union sold bullion to cover costs of recent grain 
purchases said jim steel an analyst with refco inc in new york 
but the decline in the dollar was too strong for the precious 
metals market to ignore he said 
gold was 170 to 190 higher with may at 37190 a troy ounce 
silver was 34 cents to 39 cents higher with may at 5028 a troy 
ounce 
grain and soybean futures were mostly higher on the chicago 
board of trade as a surge of buying by professional funds boosted 
soybeans 
the strength of soybeans was surprising in that no new 
features presented themselves to the market said rich feltes an 
analyst with refco inc 
feltes noted that export sales from the united states remained 
weak while brazilian exports on a weektoweek basis were strong 
the strength of soybean futures spilled over into the corn 
market which also received a boost from continued strong export 
business feltes said the strength shown by the livestock market 
also provided a boost to corn prices 
wheat futures were relatively weak with trading light in 
anticipation of the release thursday of the us ariculture 
department crop report estimating the size winter wheat crop 
wheat was cent lower to 2 cents higher with may at 379 a 
bushel corn was 1 cent to 3 cents higher with may at 290 a 
bushel oats were 1 cent to 2 cents lower with may at 165 a 
bushel soybeans were 13 cents to 14 cents higher with may at 
646 a bushel 
livestock and pork futures were mostly higher on the chicago 
mercantile exchange 
live cattle futures were supported by firmness in the cash 
market and the perception that tuesdays selloff was overdone 
live hogs were boosted by higher pork product prices but pork 
bellies were hurt by the belief that futures were overbought 
live cattle were 15 cent to 83 cent higher with june at 7475 
cents a pound feeder cattle were 05 cent lower to 58 cent higher 
with may at 8452 cents a pound live hogs were 40 cent to 85 
cent higher with june at 6442 a pound frozen pork bellies were 
45 cent lower to 138 cents higher with may at 6795 cents a pound

in what is believed to be the first broad offer 
of its kind one of the nations biggest advertising agencies said 
wednesday it would give clients a chance to get a guarantee on its 
work 
executives from ddb needham worldwide said the guarantee means 
the agency would get bonuses for work that produces results that 
exceed expectations and make rebates for ads that fall short 
the precise terms would vary from account to account but agency 
executives said the performance plan could increase or decrease an 
advertisers bill by as much as 30 percent 
the plan comes as advertisers are questioning the value of 
paying the standard rate that has prevailed in the ad business for 
decades without regard to performance 
an ad agency traditionally gets a 15percent cut of what an 
advertiser spends on print space or commercial air time 
there is a lot of pressure from clients for agencies to go on 
the line and be accountable for what their advertising does for the 
clients business said arthur anderson a principal in morgan 
anderson amp co an adviser to advertisers 
william weilbacher an advertising consultant said his latest 
survey for the association of national advertisers indicated only 
about a third of companies contacted last year said they pay the 
standard 15 percent rate for advertising down from about 50 
percent in a 1983 survey 
the proposal also comes as marketers are spending a greater 
portion of their budgets on activities such as package design 
sales promotion and direct mailing rather than on conventional 
advertising to the dismay of ad agencies who are paid on the basis 
of what is spent for media placements 
ddb needham was the 10th largest advertising agency based on 
worldwide billings with nearly 41 billion in 1989 according to 
the trade journal advertising age 
it produces ads for volkswagen and audi cars michelob beer 
clairol hair products ralston purina pet foods michelin tires and 
oreida potatoes 
keith l reinhard chairman and chief executive told a group of 
media representatives that the agency has been working on the 
program for more than three years 
he said it should inspire new heights of original thought and 
surprising execution because the goals are clearer and workers 
will have new incentives 
the plan works like this 
the agency and the advertiser decide on precise objectives such 
as increasing the number of customers coming into stores by a 
certain percentage or increasing consumer awareness of a brand 
the client agrees to spend a certain amount on behalf of the 
brand to integrate all of the brands marketing efforts with the 
main advertising message and to maintian the quality price and 
distribution of the product 
at the end of an agreed timeframe the results would be tallied 
and the agency would either have to pay a rebate if results came up 
short or would get a bonus if the results meet or exceed the target 
the agency would share twothirds of any bonus with employees 
who produced the improved results 
reinhard said the program has been tested with different 
clients who he declined to identify and would be made available 
first to the agencys us and canadian clients he said two have 
already said they plan to use the program the agency has 65 major 
national advertisers 
we feel confident that we have both the tools and the talent 
in hand to support this kind of guarantee he said 
several ddb needham clients such as ralston purina corp 
anheuserbusch inc and volkswagenaudi were asked for their 
reactions to the proposal but declined to comment 
industry analysts were divided on the potential impact of the 
plan for the industry in general 
they said many agencies are already working for some clients 
under compensation plans that give them bonuses for good work 
leslie winthrop the domestic president of the advertising 
agency register which matches advertisers and agencies said it 
was a very courageous thing to do for ddb needham to make the 
plan available to all clients 
she said other agencies would probably sit back and wait to 
see how it will work 
but weilbacher said ddb needhams plan is a threat to other 
agencies i dont see how an agency cannot respond to this 
gauntlet that has been thrown down he said

the dollar fell sharply wednesday against most 
other major currencies as the foreign exchange market grew 
increasingly concerned about indications that the us economy is 
softening 
gold prices rose 
traders and currency analysts said the strength of the west 
german mark and the swiss franc accounted for much of the dollars 
losses although the dollar also fell sharply against the japanese 
yen 
the dollar traded at 14020 swiss francs late wednesday in new 
york down sharply from 14310 francs late tuesday in london the 
dollar fell to 14039 swiss francs from 14332 late tuesday 
the swiss franc is being viewed as a safe haven for investors 
because many other major currencies appear troubled by domestic 
concerns said brian guidera a currency trader for swiss bank 
corp in new york 
its being seen to be the only logical alternative to the 
uncertainty elsewhere in the world he said as far as 
highyielding currencies go its seen as stable 
traders also said the swiss franc is boosted by that nations 
relatively high interest rates 
the dollar was viewed as the currency of choice until friday 
when government figures showed employment growth in april was far 
lower than economists expected traders said that report altered 
the belief that the us economy was expanding and that higher 
interest rates would result 
higher domestic interest rates increase the relative 
attractiveness of returns on a nations currency

dollar was trading at 16365 marks in new york late in the day 
down from 16575 marks late tuesday the dollar fell in london to 
16375 marks from 16580 marks late tuesday 
william harrington an international economist with the wefa 
group in bala cynwyd pa said the mark has benefited from the 
recent belief that the union of the currencies of west and east 
germany will go more smoothly than originally forecast 
the dollar also fell sharply against the japanese yen 
in tokyo the dollar closed at 15703 yen down 102 yen from

bond prices fell wednesday despite the 
completion of another wellreceived round in the treasurys 
threepart quarterly refunding auction 
the treasurys benchmark 30year bond finished down 1332 point 
or 4 per 1000 face amount while its yield which rises when 
prices fall rose to 886 percent from 882 percent late tuesday 
prices moved generally lower in advance of the announcement of 
the results of the treasurys auction of 10 billion in 10year 
notes 
kevin flanagan a money market economist for dean witter 
reynolds inc said prices were depressed by weakness in the dollar 
and worries that demand for the 10year notes was weak 
but the auction results announced late in the session turned 
out better than expected as investors grabbed the 10year notes at 
yields of 888 percent the highest level since a similar auction 
averaged 918 percent may 10 1989 
flanagan said 30 billion in bids were received for the 10 
billion in notes reflecting exceptionally strong demand for the 
issues 
that also was reflected in the amount of noncompetitive bids 
which amounted to 659 million and the highest level since august 
1985 noncompetitive bids often are submitted by individuals or 
small accounts who are content to buy securities at whatever the 
average yield turns out to be 
the refunding auctions began tuesday with the sale of 1057 
billion in threeyear notes with an average yield of 874 percent 
the highest since such notes averaged 912 percent last may 9 
market watchers say the strong demand for threeyear and 10year 
notes may not necessarily spill over into thursdays scheduled 
auction of 10 billion in 30year bonds that sale will complete 
the refunding auction 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
governments fell by 116 point intermediate maturities fell lsqb 
point to 732 point and longterm issues lost as much as 716 
point according to telerate inc the financial information 
service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer fell 198 to 113866 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively 
traded municipal bonds fell 132 point to 89 2932 the average 
yield to maturity was unchanged at 765 percent the same as late 
tuesday 
yields on threemonth treasury bills fell to 799 percent as the 
discount lost 4 basis points to 774 percent yields on sixmonth 
bills fell to 818 percent as the discount fell 3 basis points to 
776 percent yields on oneyear bills fell to 836 percent as the 
discount lost 1 basis point to 777 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest rate banks charge each 
other on overnight loans was quoted at 8 316 percent unchanged 
from late tuesday

usx corp has fetched 25 million in an 
auction of 15 works of art in a sale that art analysts say runs 
counter to a corporate trend of buying expensive art 
the steel and energy giant has decided to sell a total of 64 
works from its 100piece collection because they can fetch a 
price said usx spokesman bill keslar 
buyers this week snatched up the 15 contemporary pieces for 
750000 more than the preauction estimate 
the market is strong for art work keslar said this was a 
privately held collection and it is like any other asset of a 
corporation 
a morris louis contemporary painting beta zeta and a frank 
stella painting concentric squares each sold for 462000 
about 100000 more than their preauction estimates 
joan mitchells belle bete which sold for 385000 was 
estimated to be worth up to 250000 jules olitskis strips 
heresy sold for 352000 more than double its estimated value 
most of the buyers were european asian and american collectors 
said jay cantor director of museum and corporate services at 
christies 
impressionist and modern works will be auctioned may 1516 and 
american selections will be sold may 2223 at christies in new 
york a selection of european postwar abstract art will be sold at 
christies in london on june 28 
most companies that buy fine art do so to enhance the working 
environment said cantor 
no company has embarked on an art program primarily as an 
investment said beatrix medinger manager principle of viart 
corp in new york which helps companies create collections in 
the last 10 years theres been an astronomical increase in the 
number of corporations who have worked at putting art collections 
together 
chase manhattan corp started the trend in 1959 the banks 
13000piece collection is spread among 350 locations worldwide 
said margaret della cioppa manager of chase manhattans art 
program 
the bank has several pieces from famous artists including a 
picasso painting none of the collection has been sold ms della 
cioppa said 
they companies dont think of it as an investment she 
said i think its more to do with their image than buying and 
selling if it were to be considered an investment it would be 
a good investment because the art market is up 
some companies have opened their collections to the public but 
others keep them behind closed doors 
at usx some museums offered to exhibit the companys collection 
but executives turned them down said leon arkus former director 
of the carnegie museum of art 
arkus led the committee that selected the usx collection more 
than 20 years ago 
its got to do with the attitude of a corporation who sees 
only dollar signs and doesnt see beneath it all arkus said 
why usx kept that collection secret heaven knows 
keslar however said the company is not under any obligation to 
keep the collection in its headquarters city also usx wouldnt 
have received tax breaks by donating the collection keslar said 
the profits from the sale will be returned to the companys 
general funds he said 
corporate art collecting is extremely popular but the incentive 
to donate works to nonprofit institutions diminished in 1986 when 
us lawmakers removed tax breaks cantor said

federated department stores inc and allied 
stores corp on wednesday obtained a fourmonth extension in which 
to file their plan to emerge from chapter 11 bankruptcy 
reorganization 
lawyers for the retailing units of campeau corp told us 
bankruptcy judge j vincent aug jr they might need even longer 
than the newly approved deadline of sept 12 because the case is so 
complex 
federated and allied have more than 200000 creditors about 
100000 employees and operate 260 stores in 28 states 
the judge also approved a settlement federated negotiated with 
the internal revenue service in a dispute over how taxes on 
inventory movement and size in 198183 
under the agreement federated will receive a 23 million refund 
from the irs but will adopt irs tax computing methods over a 
10year period starting with the 1983 tax year that could 
increase federateds taxes by 14 million during that time 
federated lawyer rick cieri said the settlement increases the 
value of federated for creditors provides additional money for its 
operations and saves the cost of continued litigation 
aug approved the settlement over the objection of new yorkbased 
citibank which wanted to know whether federateds parent company 
federated stores inc would claim any of the 23 million refund 
robert seppelt vice president of taxes for federated department 
stores said fsi has no claim to the 23 million 
none of the federated or allied creditors objected to the 
extension aug granted without it federated and allied would have 
had to file the plan by sunday four months after the companies 
filed their chapter 11 petitions jan 15 
the petitions listed 77 billion in debts most accumulated 
when torontobased campeau bought both companies in leveraged deals 
in 1986 and 1988 
in another matter wednesday aug ruled against b bros realty 
limited partnership landlord of bloomingdales posh flagship store 
in manhattan the partnership had claimed the lease for the store 
which runs through 2006 had become invalid because it was 
transferred from federated to bloomingdales the landlord wanted 
the store vacated by may 17 
but the judge angrily rejected the claim determining that the 
store was continuing to operate normally and paying the rent 
promptly he further ordered the landlord to pay federateds 
defense costs in the matter accusing the partnerships owners of 
vexatious conduct and harassment carol sanger federated 
spokeswoman said the defense costs hadnt been determined

the governments top telephone regulator said 
wednesday he can safely control the huge regional bell telephone 
companies if they are allowed to design and manufacture telephone 
equipment 
but bell rivals and consumer groups told a senate hearing they 
were concerned bell companies could drive out competition and 
subsidize new business ventures with their monopoly local telephone 
earnings 
a bill by sen ernest f hollings dsc would lift 
manufacturing restrictions imposed on the seven regional bell 
companies by a court ruling that ended an american telephone amp 
telegraph co antitrust suit in 1984 
the hollings bill would allow the bells to design develop and 
make telecommunications equipment including network and customer 
premises equipment 
it also has provisions requiring that such activities take place 
in the united states and assuring against crosssubsidies 
the fccs admitted inability to fully monitor the business 
practices of atampt led to the federal consent decree in which atampt 
in 1984 spun off the regional bells 
but fcc chairman alfred sikes told the senate commerce science 
and transportation subcommittee on communications that the fcc 
with an increased budget and new price regulatory scheme was 
prepared to monitor bell manufacturing activities 
existing pending and proposed fcc and state regulatory 
safeguards will be adequate to safeguard the interests of telephone 
ratepayers and potential bell company manufacturing competitors 
sikes said 
sikes said the fcc also is aided now by bell competitors eager 
to blow the whistle on any bell missteps 
but gene kimmelman legislative director of the consumer 
federation of america said lifting the manufacturing restrictions 
could mean substantial local rate increases and diminished 
competition in return for theoretical vaguely articulated 
benefits 
albert kramer general counsel of the north american 
telecommunications association said his group of equipment 
manufacturers and distributors opposes the bill because it would 
not improve competitiveness 
hollings said he was not sure when he would try to advance the 
bill a similar version is pending in the house of representatives 
previous efforts to free the bells from restrictions have not 
advanced in congress but the bells have launched a 
multimilliondollar campaign this year to try to swing public and 
congressional opinion to their side

a federal judge declared a mistrial wednesday 
after a jury failed to agree on how much money to award an inventor 
whose patent for an intermittent windshield wiper was violated by 
ford motor co 
us district judge avern cohns decision came after six days of 
deliberations 
the jury decided on jan 29 that ford had infringed on the 
patent held by robert w kearns but ruled tuesday that the 
infringement was not intentional limiting the amount he could be 
awarded 
tuesdays ruling meant kearns only could be awarded compensatory 
damages and not punitive damages court executive john mayer said 
the jury of five women and three men was dismissed by the judge 
who will oversee a new damages trial with new jurors 
we are disappointed the jury was unable to reach a verdict in 
damages ford spokesman tom foote said however we are pleased 
that the jury recognized that ford didnt intentionally infringe 
the kearns patents 
foote said ford already has asked the judge to overrule the 
jurys finding that kearns patents were valid we expect the 
court to hold a hearing on that motion in the near future he 
said 
kearns said the delay was a disappointment they stole more 
than my invention they stole a business opportunity he said 
they stole what makes america great 
after the jurys january decision cohn issued an order 
forbidding kearns or ford officials from talking about the case 
kearns 62 of gaithersburg md claimed in his 12yearold 
suit that he installed a set of his intermittent wipers on a 1962 
ford and took it to the automaker he said he believed ford would 
buy his invention since engineers questioned him at length about it 
the former wayne state university professor also is suing 
general motors corp chrysler corp honda motor co ltd and a 
dozen other automakers and autorelated companies the case against 
ford was the first to go to trial

cbs inc boss laurence a tisch conceded 
wednesday that the television networks primetime ratings are a 
disaster but said there will be improvement with next falls 
schedule 
during a raucous shareholders meeting the cbs president and 
chief executive also called for regulators to free the three major 
tv networks to share in the financial rewards from reruns of 
programs sold in syndication 
cbs third in prime time ratings for three consecutive seasons 
had its worst primetime record in the 30week season that ended in 
april cbs averaged a 122 rating a 4 percent drop from 198889 
each ratings point represents 921000 households and by some 
estimates is worth 100 million in advertising revenue over a 
years time 
tisch has insisted for the past two years that he is intent on 
having the network regain leadership in prime time 
but some shareholders said during the 2hour meeting that they 
saw little evidence of progress 
one shareholder complained that members of the cbs board other 
than cbs founder william paley and former cbs news anchor walter 
cronkite have no background in broadcasting another said cbs 
programming puts her to sleep 
tisch said the board members are knowledgable and pointed out 
that cbs is first in daytime and sports ratings adding we are 
not a total disaster 
the company committed itself over the past year to spend more 
than 35 billion for the rights to broadcast the major league 
baseball playoffs professional football the ncaa basketball 
tournament and two winter olympics 
the network hopes those highprofile events will help draw 
viewers to its primetime lineup 
we are a total disaster only in prime time tisch said 
adding that he was confident that was being corrected 
he said you will see progress in september with the new fall 
schedule drawn up by jeff sagansky new president of cbs 
entertainment sagansky was hired late last year to succeed kim 
lemasters who held the job for two seasons 
nonetheless tisch said cbs will suffer some effect from the 
federal communications commissions oneyear waiver that allows fox 
broadcasting co to offer its 129 affiliates up to 18 hours of 
programming a week 
the waiver lets fox expand beyond the 15 hours the fcc considers 
the threshold for defining a network a mantle fox doesnt want to 
wear 
had the waiver been refused fox would have had to scale back 
its plans to expand programming this fall or withdraw from the 
luucrative program syndication business from which cbs nbc and abc 
now are barred by fcc rules 
unlike the television networks the major studios and cable 
companies freely participate in ownership of both programs and 
delivery systems tisch said he said foreign companies have also 
benefited from these restrictions on the networks by buying 
american studios 
if the 90s are to be a decade of robust healthy competition 
among all industry forces the handcuffs must come off the three 
american broadcast networks he said

president bush and congressional leaders 
announced plans wednesday for emergency budget talks to cut up to 
100 billion from a rapidly worsening federal deficit tax 
increases as well as spending cuts will be on the negotiating table 
severe action is needed to avoid the huge automatic cuts 
that would be triggered throughout federal programs if 
deficitreduction targets are not met next fall said presidential 
spokesman marlin fitzwater 
the leadership in the house and the senate has accepted 
the presidents invitation to a budget summit with no 
preconditions declared house speaker thomas s foley dwash 
negotiators for the house senate and white house will meet for 
the first time next tuesday at the white house said fitzwater 
bush will chair the first session after that he will be 
involved as necessary fitzwater said 
the spokesman blamed increasing interest rates lower revenues 
to the treasury from a sluggish economy and a higherthanexpected 
cost of the savings and loan bailout for the widening deficit gap 
internal administration estimates suggest that the government 
will miss deficitreduction targets next fall by up to 100 
billion fitzwater said 
while the numbers arent clear it does seem clear to the 
legislative leaders as well as the administration that severe 
action needs to be taken to reduce the deficit and keep the economy 
on a sound track he said in announcing the budget talks 
although a no new taxes pledge was a central part of bushs 
1988 campaign deteriorating economic conditions now make massive 
spending cuts likely next fall in the absence of major 
deficitcutting action administration officials say 
neither white house officials nor congressional leaders would 
predict whether tax increases might be included in an ultimate 
compromise or what kind or size they might be if included 
however there seemed a growing feeling on all sides that 
deficit reductions of the magnitude now being discussed could not 
be achieved through budget cuts alone 
no timetables or deadlines were set but house minority leader 
bob michel rill said he hoped for some real significant 
progress before congress fourth of july recess 
no decisions have been made other than to begin discussions 
next week on what we hope will be a good faith effort to deal with 
a very serious national problem senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine said 
seriousness was more evident than optimism 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas said in a senate 
speech i think were prepared to succeed but we may not 
succeed he said coming up with a longelusive bipartisan budget 
agreement was like putting humptydumpty together again 
rep dan rostenkowski dill the chairman of the taxdrafting 
house ways and means committee pointed to political differences 
among the negotiators and said i dont think were going to be 
able to come up with anything out of this group 
the budget summit proposed by bush earlier in the week was 
annunced after top congressional leaders met with the president for 
about an hour 
foley named house majority leader richard gephardt dmo an 
outspoken critic of bush administration policies as leader of the 
house negotiating team 
i expect that were going to proceed in good faith with these 
discussions and were not going to attempt to politicize them on 
either side foley said 
some democrats have voiced concerns that the administration may 
be trying to trap them into advocating electionyear tax increases 
but foley said i trust the white house until i have reason not 
to and i have no reason not to

the textbook publishing and insurance 
concern harcourt brace jovanovich inc said wednesday it has 
terminated discussions on selling some of its assets and public 
debt 
former us sen eugene mccarthy who has served for a decade on 
hbjs board has previously said the company was holding talks with 
the thomson corp a canadian company that owns newspapers other 
publishing interests and a travel business 
harcourt which has been struggling under a huge debt incurred 
in avoiding a takeover in 1987 acknowledged last month that it was 
in talks but did not identify who it was talking to or what was 
being discussed 
thomson offered no comment on the reports 
on wednesday harcourt said the talks had involved acquisition 
of certain limited assets of hbj by a third party and the 
purchase of some or all of hbjs existing public debt at a 
discount from book value 
hbj incurred a 2 billion debt through a recapitalization that 
it undertook as it resisted a hostile 1987 takeover bid by british 
publisher robert maxwell 
last year harcourt sold its theme parks business for about 11 
billion below what some analysts expected the company would get 
in an effort to reduce debt 
but moodys investors service the credit rating agency lowered 
the companys debt rating in february and said the companys cash 
flow from publishing and insurance will provide only narrow 
coverage of anticipated interest payments and capital expenses 
coming due shortly 
within three years harcourt is to start paying hundreds of 
millions of dollars more in annual dividends and interest to 
bondholders 
moodys said those obligations will likely necessitate further 
asset sales andor debt restructuring

since last novembers 65 percent it left inflation over the 
previous 12 months at 169032 percent and 2518 percent for the 
year to date 
officials on wednesday attributed the sharp april decline to a 
severe antiinflationary adjustment to economic policy put into 
effect by the 10monthold government of president carlos menem

confirmed a tendency toward stabilization initiated in the second 
half of march and predicted the may inflation rate would be even 
lower than aprils

decline in inflation indicated that public finances are under 
control a return to hyperinflation experienced from december

in january and 616 percent in february the 12month inflation 
figure hit a high of 20266 percent in march 
in its recent policy adjustment the government sharply reduced 
the money supply halting the practice of printing money to finance 
deficit spending by public companies and other government entities 
earlier economy minister antonio ernan gonzalez removed 
exchange controls allowing the local currency to float against the 
dollar and sharply increased public utility rates and fuel prices 
menem a 59yearold lawyer and former provincial governor has 
pledged to spur economic growth by balancing the budget selling 
moneylosing state companies deregulating monopolies ending 
subsidies lowering trade barriers reforming the tax code and 
eliminating corruption 
economic policy has been criticized by organized labor which 
charges that real wages have fallen 50 percent below the average 
for the 1980s and claims that privatization will lead to loss of 
jobs and benefits as well as national patrimony

the governments prosecution of three commodity 
traders is simply a case about fraud a federal prosecutor said 
wednesday at the first trial resulting from an fbi probe at the 
worlds largest futures exchanges 
assistant us attorney mark pollack cautioned the jury in 
opening remarks at the us district court trial not to be 
distracted by the unfamiliar rules and intricate mechanics of 
futures trading 
these are not complicated crimes pollack said these are 
simple crimes that occurred in a complex setting 
stripped to its barest essentials the evidence will 
demonstrate that this is a case about fraud he said 
defendants robert d mosky danny l scheck and david zatz are 
accused of defrauding public customers as they traded swiss franc 
futures at the chicago mercantile exchange 
they are the first to go on trial of 47 traders and a clerk 
indicted last year after an unprecedented fbi sting operation at 
the merc and the chicago board of trade the worlds two largest 
commodity futures exchanges 
defense lawyers were to make their opening statements thursday 
morning followed by the first prosecution witness an official of 
the federal commodity futures trading commission the cftc 
regulates futures trading 
pollack began his opening statement after 12 jurors and five 
alternates were chosen in a morning session before us district 
judge ann c williams 
the three defendants were motivated by greed pure and 
simple he said 
a thief who plies his trade in the guise of a bright trading 
jacket and uses a deck of customer orders is no less a thief than a 
common cat burglar the prosecutor said 
pollack devoted much of his statement to explaining the basics 
of futures trading educating the jury could prove a daunting task 
in the trial expected to last about six weeks 
the prosecutor also told jurors they would hear conversations 
about illegal trading secretly recorded by fbi agent randall 
jannett who posed as a corrupt trader 
among the recorded comments the jury will hear pollack said is 
a statement mosky allegedly made to jannett that good things 
happen to those who help out 
pollack said mosky made the remark after jannett agreed to a 
trade that deprived a customer of a profit opportunity 
that phrase captures the essence of what this case is all 
about pollack said ill help you you help me well each 
make money at the expense of the unwitting customer 
mosky faces charges of racketeering conspiracy 28 counts of 
mail or wire fraud and 51 counts of violating federal 
futurestrading rules if convicted on all counts he could be 
sentenced to 415 years in prison and fined 124 million 
zatz and scheck are charged with more than a dozen counts each 
of mail or wire fraud and trading violations they face maxiumum 
sentences of 70 years and 90 years in prison and fines of 21 
million and 3 million respectively 
sixteen of those indicted have pleaded guilty to reduced charges 
in return for their cooperation 
the governments case hinges on the testimony of two traders who 
worked with the defendants and have pleaded guilty to fraud 
charges and on the observations and taperecorded evidence 
gathered by jannett 
a swiss franc future is a contract to buy or sell a specified 
amount of the currency at a future date at a price agreed upon in 
advance 
banks and multinational businesses trade currency futures as 
insurance against foreign exchange losses futures contracts also 
are traded by speculators seeking to profit from the constantly 
changing prices

the state of florida moved wednesday to join 
the st petersburg times in a legal battle over stock dividends 
with a shareholder group led by texas billionaire robert m bass 
attorney general bob butterworth filed a motion to intervene in 
us district court in tampa saying he wanted to help fend off an 
attack by profiteers 
his action fulfilled a promise in march to join the times in the 
case 
the bass group known as the poynterjamison ventures limited 
partnership filed suit in february against the times publishing 
co and the poynter institute a nonprofit journalism school that 
uses times stock dividends to support its operations 
the bass group owns 40 percent of the companys voting stock but 
receives only 57 percent of its dividends the poynter institute 
owns a majority of the voting stock and receives 83 percent of the 
dividends by virtue of its control of most of the companys 
preferred stock 
the bass group wants to change the stock structure to get a 
better return on its investment times publishing defends the stock 
arrangement as beneficial to the journalistic standards of the 
newspaper and the health of poynter institute 
the relief sought by the ventures partners would significantly 
diminish the future resources of the poynter institute 
butterworth said 
the attorney general has determined that it is important to 
florida public policy to protect such arrangements from attack by 
profiteers 
also butterworth said he wanted to send a message to 
reassure those persons who desire to give money to charities that 
their request and wishes will be honored by the state of florida 
and that the state will not permit charitable bequests to be 
usurped by outside speculators and interlopers 
the bass group includes relatives of the late nelson poynter 
who founded the institute and set up the unusual stock arrangement
