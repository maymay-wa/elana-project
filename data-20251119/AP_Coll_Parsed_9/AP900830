president bush promised wednesday that 
american combat troops would do what it takes to deter iraqi 
aggression while the white house rejected conditions that an 
official said were secretly offered by baghdad for releasing 
foreign hostages and withdrawing from kuwait 
bush in a pep talk intended for us forces in the persian gulf 
but heard by very few offered the nations thanks for their 
service amid scorching temperatures and other hardships 
youre now in the middle of one of the toughest military 
missions in modern memory he said well as tough as it is 
know this thanks to you nobodys feeling the heat more than the 
government in baghdad 
a report that iraq had sent the white house a secret message 
brought mixed signals from the administration a white house 
official confirmed a message had been received but said the offer 
had been rejected the state department denied any knowledge of 
such a message 
the white house official said a former highranking us 
official recently delivered a secret message from iraq offering to 
release hostages and pull out of kuwait if certain demands were 
met the message was delivered to brent scowcroft the presidents 
national security adviser said the official 
this is basically a nonstarter the white house official 
said of the offer our position has always been that iraq must 
withdraw from kuwait anything that seeks to circumvent the un 
resolve does not provide great optimism for movement he said 
commenting only on condition of anonymity 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said secretary of 
state james a baker iii had no knowledge whatsoever of a secret 
back channel message 
in the message iraq demanded that un sanctions be withdrawn 
and that it be guaranteed access to the persian gulf as well as 
sole control of an oil field that dips into kuwait according to 
newsday which first reported the proposal 
in baghdad iraqs official news agency said no such proposal 
was made 
the white house issued a statement late wednesday acknowledging 
that a former administration official relayed ideas concerning 
the persian gulf situation to scowcroft recently 
the statement did not identify the source of the ideas but 
said scowcroft did inform baker about what had been suggested 
the administration has received many such proposals and ideas 
as it does at any time during a crisis from various individuals 
white house deputy press secretary roman popadiuk said there was 
nothing in this particular proposal that merited its pursuit 
both baker and scowcroft were invited to dinner with bush at the 
white house along with an unspecified number of senate and house 
members 
popadiuk at a briefing for reporters originally had refused to 
confirm or deny the existence of any message from iraq saying 
merely were aware of many initiatives that are being undertaken 
by various bodies 
he said it would be selfdefeating to start singling out one 
proposal or one putative proposal or initiative at the expense of 
others he said the main point is that the united nations has 
spoken as one voice in demanding that iraq pull its troops out 
of kuwait 
popadiuk also said there was no indication iraq had carried out 
its promise to free foreign women and children the state 
department said it would be a significant step in the right 
direction if iraq did follow through on that promise 
in other developments 
two television networks nbc and cnn said us agencies 
particularly army special forces troops and the cia were helping 
the kuwaiti resistance in hitandrun attacks on iraqi occupiers 
no us troops were said to be involved but kuwaiti fighters based 
on the saudikuwait border were reported to be getting 
intelligence weapons radios advice and instruction from the 
united states 
a us diplomatic source confirmed the reports in general terms 
saying were aware of their action and were supporting them 
this source claimed to be unaware of details 
white house spokesman roman popadiuk said we dont comment on 
intelligence matters 
the white house under pressure from congress said it was 
seeking help from allies to defray the expense of deploying tens of 
thousands of us combat forces to the persian gulf the cost is 
estimated at 25 billion through september 
japan pledged money medical assistance and nonmilitary 
supplies but said it would not provide soldiers or weapons 
the washington post said in thursday editions a draft plan 
prepared for a national security council meeting wednesday called 
for total contributions of 13 billion from japan 600 million 
from germany 4 billion from saudi arabia 1 billion from the 
united arab emirates 3 billion from kuwait and an undetermined 
amount from south korea the draft called for substantial sums 
would be paid to countries hurt by the trade embargo with iraq 
the administration confirmed it had asked congress to approve a 
22 billion dollar arms sale to saudi arabia including 24 f15 
warplanes 150 m60 a3 tanks 200 shoulderfired stinger missiles 
and 50 launchers and several thousand rounds of antitank 
ammunition 
other arms deals were being considered the administration said 
the 593rd area support group from fort lewis wash left with 
an undisclsoed number of soldiers for the middle east the unit 
helps other units involved in maintenance supply and 
transportation 
the 4th tactical fighter squadron based at hill air force base 
in utah flying 24 f16s and other suppporting aircraft left shaw 
air force base sc for the middle east a sister squadron the 
421st will leave hill on thursday 
the 437th services squadron meanwhile dispatched 20 members 
from charleston sc air force base to take care of mess halls and 
other installations for air force units in the middle east 
as for the proposed release of women and children about 1000 
americans could be affected 
we hope saddam hussein will have the human decency to live up 
to his word state department spokeswoman tutwiler said 
iraqs ambassador to the united states mohamed almashat went 
to the state department to formally notify the united states of the 
decision to let women and children go he said americans will be 
allowed to leave through jordan or turkey but gave no timetable 
for their departure 
almashat said that once the united states gives assurances 
that they are not going to strike iraq and attack iraq or 
aggress upon iraq then we are going to let even men out 
from the oval office bush offered words of appreciation fo the 
us forces in the gulf 
our troops around the world are providing the kind of strength 
and security that makes this mission possible bush said and 
with the support of friends and family and the admiration of this 
great nation youre proving that youll do what it takes at any 
hour anywhere to contain aggression and keep freedoms light 
alive 
the message was beamed live over armed forces radio but was not 
heard by most us soldiers because the radio network does not have 
a transmitter in saudi arabia the white house said it was heard on 
ships in the area 
in dhahran navy capt mike sherman said transcripts and tape 
recordings of the speech will be distributed to each unit stationed 
in saudi arabia a process which including delivery time would 
take a week 
bush encouraged the troops to stand strong despite many 
hardships 
he told them you stand on the front line against aggression 
and international lawlessness

nasa on thursday canceled the launch 
of space shuttle columbia scheduled for saturday because of a 
failed electronic part on one of the four telescopes in the 
shuttles cargo bay 
the launch of the shuttle with its astro observatory mission 
will take place no earlier than next wednesday said bruce 
buckingham a nasa spokesman 
nasa had been hoping for a weekend flight that would be the 
first since the discovery carried the flawed hubble space telescope 
into orbit in april launches since then have been scrubbed because 
of fuel leaks 
but the delay will give nasa a chance to put the shuttle 
discovery on another pad so it can stay on schedule for an early 
october launch the space agency has only a 19day opportunity to 
begin a discovery mission dispatching the ulysses space probe to 
study the sun the launch window will not open again for 13 
months 
engineers had been struggling most of the day thursday trying to 
establish communication with an xray observatory one of the four 
telescopes carried in the cargo bay of the columbia at first they 
could not determine whether the fault lay in a ground link or with 
the circuits inside the shuttle 
they eventually traced the problem to an avionics box on the 
xray telescope 
were not exactly sure about how were going to fix that 
box buckingham said 
nasa spokeswoman lisa malone said there are two different 
components within the box and the length of time needed for repair 
depends on which of the parts is broken 
were talking midweek for the launch she said its going 
to take several days to look at it 
the launch of the astro observatory aboard the columbia already 
had been delayed five years it originally was scheduled for march 
1986 but the challenger disaster in january 1986 cancelled all 
flights 
the mission was rescheduled for may 30 but when fuel was pumped 
into the shuttle tanks a leak was discovered 
the new problem surfaced after columbias payload bay doors were 
closed wednesday night 
the shuttle sitting on its seaside pad is connected with the 
launch control center 3 miles away with regular telephonetype 
lines 
program scientist ed weiler said full contact with the 
observatory is necessary for launch the scientific returns from 
the flight will not suffer if the flight must be delayed a few 
days he said 
a few days slip really wont affect it at all it really 
wont change it weiler said 
the delay in launching columbia has created the longest gap 
between shuttle missions since flights resumed following the 1986 
challenger disaster 
the 150 million astro observatory will probe some of the 
hottest objects in the universe during the mission which will last 
nine to 10 days a comet and supernova are among the approximately 
150 targets 
four astronomers aboard columbia will work nonstop in shifts to 
operate astros three ultraviolet telescopes the xray telescope 
will be managed by computer commands sent from goddard space flight 
center in greenbelt md 
it is the first shuttle mission in five years devoted entirely 
to scientific research 
were just as enthusiastic as we ever were about having an 
absolutely firstclass stateoftheart scientific mission 
astronaut jeffrey hoffman said after arriving wednesday night from 
johnson space center in houston we hope to come back having seen 
some things that nobodys ever seen before 
columbias commander vance brand said the crews morale dropped 
after the first failed launch attempt but has since shot back up 
my morale is great and i think i can detect the same in the 
other crewmen brand said

the smallisbeautiful fraternity of 
ale fanatics had a bitter surprise at the great british beer 
festival 
the grand champion burton ale was made by one of the six giant 
breweries that are the betes noires of the british beer snob 
michael jackson an englishman who calls himself the worlds 
bestknown beer writer declared that burton ale really is a very 
serious english bitter a classic example of an english bitter 
he rhapsodized about the beautiful balance of the sweetness of 
the malt and the flowery floral character the drier 
characteristics of the hop i think in the end the hop wins 
through 
definitely an exception in the eyes of the campaign for real 
ale the festival sponsor 
on the whole we dont think that the national brewers do a 
particularly good job said stephen cox spokesman for the 
organization 
that doesnt mean that we dont give praise where its due 
and burton ale is actually an example of a national brewer doing 
something that we think is right 
another big brewer whitbread was banned from the festival as 
punishment for closing two old breweries in liverpool and producing 
the brands elsewhere 
burton ale is the case of a large very commercially minded 
brewery setting out its stall to show that it can make a classic 
example of this style jackson said 
closer to the heart of the campaign for real ale was woodfordes 
wherry best bitter honored as the best new beer 
allied breweries which produces burton ale controls 6500 pubs 
and 13 percent of the british beer market 
that much of the market amounts to about 90000 barrels a week 
woodforde produces 150 barrels on a good week at its brewery in 
woodbastwick in norfolk said bram lowe the sales manager 
britains traditional ales the bitters milds and stouts 
have been shoved aside in recent decades by lagers many of them 
from such foreign brewers as heineken grolsch and fosters 
real caskconditioned ale once the working mans pint has gone 
upmarket while lager gave birth to the lager lout an 
allpurpose term for young rowdies 
im really an unapologetic beer snob jackson said i feel 
that beer is demonstrably as complex a product as wine and deserves 
taking as seriously as wine does 
since the campaign for real ale began in 1971 the number of 
breweries in britain has grown from about 100 to roughly 250 cox 
said 
british ales even the style of drawing a pint vary noticeably 
by region 
i personally like to see quite a nice thick creamy head 
john hayward of allied breweries said by telephone from company 
headquarters in burtonupontrent people in london dont like 
one at all 
the festival held in a warehouselike hotel annex in the first 
week of august offered 300 varieties of ale 
included in the fanciful convention of brands were titanic 
lifeboat shepherd neame bishops finger crouch vale 
willie warmer trough hogshead uley pigor mortis 
archers headbanger orkney skullsplitter and whitbys own 
woblle 
if real ale must be old ale there were old growler old 
grumble old peculier old merlin old hookey old 
buzzard old thumper owd roger and old lubrication 
each cask was labeled with its specific gravity with 1000 
representing water and higher numbers indicating higher potency 
we drink first of all the 1030s the 1040s said peter 
crombecq leading a delegation of three from the belgian beer group 
de objectieve bierproeuers and then as pousse cafe a 1050 or 
a 1060 
crombecq said there was a limit to how many bitters milds 
stouts and ciders he could taste at one session 
depends as he put it if you want to taste in depth 
five if we want to taste the hop taste the basic taste 10 
he was well past 10 but agreed to analyze the vaux double maxim 
in his glass dry and bitter roasty a little sweet the 
aftertaste is especially dry 
belgium has 107 breweries less than half the british total but 
may do better per square mile 
ah i know the figures per square mile in bavaria crombecq 
said dreamily there is one brewery for 33 square miles in 
germany as a whole its one brewery per 240 square miles in 
belgium its one brewery for 330 square miles

an army unit on the kansas plain 
has produced a booklet to help us soldiers in saudi arabia learn 
the lifeordeath lessons of the desert 
the desert can easily kill an unprepared soldier warns the 
new manual prepared for operation desert shield 
filled with commonsense plainspoken language the 25page 
booklet is packed with a few basic rules of survival for those 
unprepared for desert climes 
its a basic training document if youve not had any 
experience in the desert said brig gen james lyle the 
commander of the unit that put the publication together 
some of its hints 
you lose less water if you keep your clothes on 
dont play with snakes 
before putting clothes on in the field check for critters 
wood shrinks in the desert make sure axheads are secure 
before using 
check your feet daily change socks frequently 
the army has printed 250000 copies of the little manual and 
5000 were flown to saudi arabia this week lyle said 
its designed to fit in the pocket right here the general 
said slapping the thigh pocket on his camouflage uniform 
lyle is in charge of the center for lessons learned the army 
unit that gleans studies and reports from many army exercises or 
activities and then compiles a huge data base to help commanders 
teach their soldiers the best way to plan organize and carry out 
their missions 
the booklet winning in the desert was put together in four 
days it uses information gathered from the armys desert training 
center at fort irwin calif from joint ussaudi exercises held 
during the past 10 years and exercises conducted by the saudi 
arabian national guard lyle said 
the publication is brief and blunt about the dangers the desert 
can hold 
but it also points out that men have waged war in those harsh 
environs for centuries some more successfully than others 
knowledge of the desert is key 
priorities may alter techniques will vary but soldiers 
leaders and units who are fit and welltrained to fight will 
have little difficulty adjusting to desert war lyle said 
small maps of saudi arabia and iraq are accompanied by brief 
discussions of each countrys geography and climate 
a section on the desert clearly points out the dangers of too 
much sun and too little water but it also tells soldiers not to 
lie or sit on the ground since those surfaces can be 30 degrees 
hotter than the air 
dont panic if you become lost it says remember that the sun 
rises in the east the booklet advises offering a way to find 
ones direction with a rock and a stick 
if you have water drink it if water is limited keep 
your mouth shut do not talk to conserve moisture in your body 
it says 
the environment plays havoc with the militarys equipment the 
booklet warns 
on rocky deserts the m54 5ton truck is prone to air 
hydraulic cylinder failure and powersteering leaks it says 
batteries dont hold their charge in intense heat either 
you must keep ammunition away from direct heat and sunlight 
if it can be held by bare hands it is safe to fire the 
publication says one way to keep it cooler is to bury it at least 
three feet deep and in a shaded area 
weapons may become clogged or missiles jammed on launching 
rails due to dust or sand accumulation leading to early detonation 
driving in the desert is best on tracked vehicles but success 
has less to do with mobility than the skill of the driver 
a relatively agile vehicle will sink up to the hubs if its 
driver insists on gunning the engine in soft sand the 
publication warns 
dust sand rough terrain and temperature extremes cause a 50 
percent increase in the repair parts needed to support a combat 
unit it says 
lyle said his unit has been getting an average of 17 to 25 
queries daily from us commanders in saudi arabia asking how to 
cope with such problems as conkedout batteries tread life on 
tanks or operating helicopters in the desert 
and he added were getting feedback constantly on whether 
the suggestions work 
over and over the book reminds soldiers to drink even if they 
arent thirsty 
experience indicates that if a man feels thirsty in the 
desert he is already on the borderline of trouble the arabs drink 
a very sweet hot tea it is possible there is good reason to 
imitate them the booklet says 
lyle added we tell them to drink until they bust

iraqi leader saddam hussein said in an interview 
wednesday that god is on our side and satan is on the side of the 
united states in the persian gulf crisis 
saddam spoke in separate interviews with cbs and french 
television his first to western reporters since the iraqi 
president sent his forces to invade kuwait on aug 2 
in a 90minute interview with cbs anchor dan rather taped in 
baghdad on wednesday the iraqi leader declared flatly kuwait is 
part of iraq 
we have said this and the legislative bodies in iraq have 
issued a clear decree saying that kuwait is an iraqi province he 
said 
saddam also denied making any secret proposals to pull out of 
kuwait 
a white house official confirmed wednesday that the bush 
administration received a secret iraqi offer to free all captives 
and withdraw from kuwait if certain conditions were met 
the conditions were that the international trade embargo against 
iraq be lifted and baghdad be granted access to the persian gulf 
and sole control of an oil field that dips into kuwait according 
to the new york area newspaper newsday 
the white house official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the offer was rejected 
saddam questioned the united states right to negotiate kuwaits 
status 
is kuwait the 52nd state of the united states he asked 
no you have said it is the 19th province of iraq replied 
rather referring to the recent annexation of kuwait 
saddam gave evasive answers to many of rathers questions 
including one on whether iraq would use chemical or biological 
weapons if invaded however he said iraq is not going to be an 
easy bite to swallow 
iraq will come out victorious saddam said god is on 
our side and satan is on the side of the united states 
in his comments for french television saddam asserted once 
again the united states cannot defeat iraq adding i do not beg 
before anyone 
the iraqi president said he is not an easy target because he 
does not remain in one place to invite being bombed he said 
defiantly that the united states is not the angel of death 
that inteview was conducted in baghdad on tuesday by french 
anchorman patrick poivre darvor of station tf1 
the first part of the twohour session with excerpts broadcast 
on the evening news took place in front of a group of western 
hostages poivre darvor said later he objected when the iraqis 
proposed including the hostages in the session and it was then 
continued in private as the two men strolled together 
poivre darvor said the film was confiscated and returned eight 
hours later with a question on western hostages deleted 
saddam who has barred westerners from leaving iraq and sent 
some of them to stategic installations to deter any us attack 
announced tuesday that women and children could leave the french 
interview was taped that day before the annoucement 
saddam spoke with an air of confidence despite the huge buildup 
of us european arab and other forces in the region to counter 
iraq 
a victory for the united states is not realistic saddam 
said he said america would have to defeat the iraqi army the 
iraqi economy and defeat the iraqi regime 
in his cbs interview saddam renewed iraqs argument that the 
foreigners held by iraq should not be called hostages 
a hostage by definition means that you have to take someone 
and ask for someone in return for releasing them what have we 
asked from the united states in return for releasing them we have 
asked for nothing he said however he did call them guests 
against their will 
saddam also said he had instructed that in the event of an 
attack the foreigners be first to go into any shelters 
these are guests he said we are treating them as guests 
and according to arab tradition guests come before households 
saddam claims he has 65 million men under arms iraq is 
estimated to have armed forces of about 1 million but saddam 
claims about 5 million iraqis serve in a militia known as the 
popular army 
in the french interview the iraqi president also denied earlier 
reports he had pledged to egyptian president hosni mubarak he would 
not invade kuwait 
when did i say i wouldnt invade kuwait tell me he said

columbias seven astronauts arrived 
wednesday night for this weekends launch expressing confidence in 
the newly repaired shuttle that is to carry them into space on an 
astronomy mission 
were ready to go we shouldnt fool around with this any 
more columbias commander vance brand said on arrival from 
johnson space center in houston we have a great ship out there 
columbia is scheduled to lift off at 117 am edt saturday with 
the 150 million astro observatory 
the hallmark of being an astronaut is being patient or being 
flexible and i think this crew has put that to the test said 
astronaut robert parker 
nasa will be making its second attempt to launch columbia for 
this mission the shuttle was supposed to go up may 30 but a 
hydrogen leak was discovered during fueling and the flight was 
called off 
atlantis was next in line but its classified pentagon mission 
was delayed from july to november when similar leaks were found 
the discovery prompted nasa to temporarily ground the entire 
threeshuttle fleet 
the countdown for saturdays launch proceeded smoothly wednesday 
amid worries over the long lull between shuttle flights and 
numerous other problems besetting the space agency 
theres anxiety said mission scientist ted gull nasa 
needs to be successful 
nasa engineers originally believed atlantis leaks were in a 
different spot than the ones on columbia both problems now appear 
to be in a 17inchdiameter valve that connects the orbiter and 
external tank 
thats clearly where the problem is said bob schwinghamer 
deputy director for space transportation if you step back and 
away from it you can expect to have some leakage there the 
question is we just have to control it keep it within acceptable 
limits 
if the new plumbing installed in columbia leaks beyond those 
limits during fueling well just stop schwinghamer said 
in addition to leaky shuttles nasa has spent the summer 
struggling with the flawed hubble space telescope carried into 
orbit by discovery in april on the last shuttle flight a mirror 
defect is preventing the 15 billion telescope from focusing 
clearly 
more recently nasa has been stymied by communications problems 
with the magellan spacecraft which is orbiting venus the 
spacecraft twice has lost contact with earth and the agency has 
delayed its mapping of venus until late september 
if all goes well columbia will be the first shuttle to fly 
since discoverys trip with hubble thats the longest gap between 
missions since flights resumed following the 1986 challenger 
disaster 
during the nine to 10day mission astros three ultraviolet 
telescopes and one xray telescope are expected to observe some of 
the hottest objects in the universe the four astronomers aboard 
will operate the ultraviolet telescopes while the xray telescope 
will be managed at goddard space flight center in greenbelt md 
weve done the best we can weve made the best payload that 
we know how weve thoroughly tested it said mission manager 
jack jones 
weve certainly had ample opportunity to simulate and train 
for the mission thats more than we would normally have so in a 
way thats a plus the astro mission originally was scheduled for 
march 1986 but the challenger disaster earlier that year delayed 
the flight and all others astros observing schedule was revised 
for the may flight and again for saturdays launch attempt 
about half of the approximately 150 objects that astro will 
observe some of them millions of degrees are the same targets 
from those in mays mission most of the others had to be replaced 
because they got too close to the sun for the instruments to see 
columbias flight will be the first shuttle mission in five 
years devoted entirely to scientific research

republican gov edward d diprete has 
watched three fellow new england governors decide not to run for 
reelection as their political fortunes deteriorated along with the 
regions economy 
his approval ratings in a brown university poll have dipped to 
16 percent less than half that of two years ago three democrats 
are fighting like wolves confident that whoever wins the sept 11 
primary can beat him 
and two local newspaper pundits have started a diprete 
political suicide watch 
yet the embattled governor says he loves his job and professes 
confidence hell be reelected to a fourth twoyear term 
in the executive branch of government you can bring about 
change you can move more quickly he said recently 
ive never been one inclined toward suicide and if i thought 
i couldnt win this race we wouldnt be having this interview 
diprete 56 who headed the familys insurance and real estate 
firm before being elected governor in 1984 cultivates a 
winnebagoandbolognasandwiches image even president bush 
stumping at a country club recently for gop candidates said he 
expected to see winnebago one there 
the governor is at his best working the coffee shops going door 
to door in shopping centers shaking hands 
give me 15 minutes and i wont turn everyone around but ill 
turn a lot of them diprete said 
nearly all the new england governors have suffered along with 
the regions economy three democrats michael dukakis in 
massachusetts william oneill in connecticut and madeleine kunin 
in vermont decided not to run again 
diprete stung by ethics questions and charges of mismanagement 
two years ago is casting himself as an experienced leader against 
untested newcomers 
the governor is heavily favored over radio talk show host steve 
white in the gop primary he has yet to launch his tv ad campaign 
hoping to trade some political ground now for a strong close in 
november 
diprete counts on the three democrats providence mayor joseph 
r paolino jr warwick mayor francis x flaherty and millionaire 
businessman bruce g sundlun to tear each other apart in the 
roughandtumble politics of the smallest state 
democrats did it in 1984 paving the way for dipretes first 
term sundlun was left to wage lonely battles in 1986 and 1988 
against a thenpopular governor 
paolino won the party endorsement in june but sundlun and 
flaherty supporters walked out as paolino spoke august brought a 
spate of negative tv ads mostly from sundlun and paolino 
its getting embarrassing said flaherty considered the 
long shot theyre whacking each other personally and 
frankly its given me the opportunity to sit back and say i agree 
with both of them 
sundlun 70 running an i am not a politician campaign 
projects flaherty and paolino as beholden to contributors 
paolino charges that sundlun traded support for contributions to 
other candidates he also accuses the former outlet stores 
president of ruining the chain a state icon although sundlun sold 
the stores two years before they closed

forest damage caused by air pollution worsened 
last year in eastern europe and the western soviet union 
officially reported a major problem for the first time a new un 
report says 
the survey by the un economic commission for europe said 
forest damage continued to grow in 1989 in several eastern european 
countries 
in parts of western europe the health of woodlands reportedly 
rebounded said the survey which was issued on wednesday 
in the soviet union heavy damage was reported by the 
byelorussian republic and in the kaliningrad region which is 
sandwiched between lithuania and poland on the baltic 
pine forests were especially affected byelorussia said a 
limited survey showed threequarters of its evergreens were damaged 
czechoslovakia poland and bulgaria also reported significant 
problems czechoslovakia had the highest share of moderately and 
severely damaged deciduous trees among 24 european countries 
providing data 
a un source said some of the increase was undoubtedly due to 
wider surveys conducted in eastern europe after last falls 
democratic changes 
the survey did not specify in which areas the problem worsened 
britain showed the broadest damage in western europe denmark 
and west germany also reported a considerable toll particularly 
among leafy trees

some of the most unscathed forests in western europe

albania has denied western reports it is 
building a wall around embassies in its capital to restrict access 
to them 
in a bid to emigrate about 5000 albanians crashed the gates 
and climbed over embassy walls last month to gain access to foreign 
missions they eventually were allowed to leave albania 
the official ata news agency quoting unidentified government 
sources said wednesday that officials were not building a wall 
instead it said at the request of some embassies themselves some 
adjustments of the walls and their lattices are being made 
it did not say which embassies are involved 
western travelers and us congressional sources reported last 
week that the only road into tiranas diplomatic quarter was 
blocked by metal barricades 
western businessmen said brick walls up to 16 inches thick were 
being erected around the embassies and that the wall was already 
10 feet high in places 
albania is the last holdout against the democratic reforms 
sweeping eastern europe

democrats are mobilizing local officials to 
protest preliminary census figures and pressure the government to 
take another look at the count for the nations cities and rural 
areas 
i dont believe it new york gov mario cuomo said wednesday 
when the census bureau estimated that his states population grew 
by fewer than 70000 during the past decade 
way out of line atlanta mayor maynard jackson said of the 
estimate for his city 
an analysis done for democratic state legislators said the 
preliminary figures for rural areas particularly in the south 
were consistently below the population estimates issued by the 
census bureau in february 
with the release of numbers for new york illinois pennsylvania 
and texas the census bureau completed its estimate of the 
population for all 50 states 
overall the preliminary census figures show the united states 
with a population of 245837683 ten years ago the census set the 
nations population at 226545805 
to no ones surprise the numbers showed americans continued to 
move south and west during the past 10 years 
nineteen us house seats will follow that population shift to 
the sun belt 
that trend was good news for republicans who consider the sun 
belt the area of their strongest growth but a similar trend in the 
1980 census when 17 house seats shifted south and west failed to 
yield expected gop gains because most of the state legislators who 
drew the new district lines were democrats 
the big winner when the shift takes place in time for the 1992 
election will be california which is expected to gain seven new 
house seats for a total of 52 with a population expected to push 
close to 30 million california would have 21 more house seats than 
the secondlargest state new york 
based on the preliminary population figures florida would gain 
four house seats and texas three picking up one each would be 
arizona georgia north carolina virginia and washington 
new york would lose three house seats and ohio pennsylvania 
michigan and illinois two each losing one seat each would be iowa 
kansas kentucky louisiana massachusetts montana new jersey and 
west virginia 
officials who think the census bureau missed a lot of people in 
their areas have 15 working days to submit information to support 
claims they were undercounted 
mayor david dinkins of new york called the estimate that his 
city lost 40000 people unadulterated nonsense and pledged to 
comb through the bureaus data to locate those areas where the 
count is too low identifying housing units the bureau overlooked 
and buildings it missed entirely 
do you really honestly believe everybody who should be counted 
was counted cuomo asked answering his own question the 
governor said of course not my mother had trouble she didnt 
want to answer 
rep vic fazio of california chairman of the house democratic 
group monitoring reapportionment urged local officials to 
challenge the preliminary figures 
now is not the time to be ringing partisan alarm bells said 
fazio but when a republican administration is on a track leading 
us to a less than fair and accurate census count democrats must 
challenge at every opportunity available 
kimball brace president of election data services a consulting 
firm that analyzes census data for democratic state legislators 
told a news conference that the figures were subject to 
considerable adjustment before the government comes out with final 
numbers on dec 31 even then the commerce department will have 
until july 15 1991 to determine whether to adjust for an 
undercount 
brace said he understood the census bureau has found up to 4 
million additional people but has not yet included them in the 
state figures he said no estimate was available on where those 
people are distributed among the states 
brace cited alabama louisiana and tennessee as states where 
figures for rural areas were well below earlier estimates

cbs news anchor dan rather got the first us 
interview wednesday with saddam hussein and the iraqi president 
used the forum to repeat his assertion that kuwait is now part of 
iraq 
saddam spoke first with french television and then with rather 
the first interviews he has granted western journalists since he 
invaded his oilrich neighbor prompting a massive us military 
buildup in saudi arabia 
cbs said the taped interview lasted 90 minutes and began shortly 
after midnight in baghdad rather was told there would be no 
interview that day but suddenly was summoned to the presidential 
palace 
the tape of the interview still was being transmitted from iraqi 
tv facilities to new york when cbss evening news was on the air in 
the eastern and central time zones 
saddam previously used tv to make his case in the persian gulf 
crisis by broadcasting two meetings between himself and groups of 
his western hostages 
kuwait is part of iraq saddam told rather we have said 
this and the legislative bodies in iraq have issued a clear decree 
saying that kuwait is an iraqi province 
saddam denied during his cbs interview that iraq is holding 
hostages even though he has barred westerners including 
americans from leaving the country and put them near military 
targets to deter attack 
when asked by rather if he expected a us military strike 
against him saddam speaking through an interpreter said we 
take this into account and we are prepared on the basis of that 
eventuality 
but he later added we want the war not to come about because 
if it were to erupt it will cause harm to the united states to 
iraq and to the world 
there were no restrictions on what rather could ask said cbs 
spokeswoman donna dees the only conditions were that iraqi tv 
cameras be used and that it be a onehour straight interview that 
would air as recorded she said 
he agreed to let the interview run longer so it could be cut for 
translation and minor editing dees said 
two excerpts first appeared on the cbs evening news and 
more was shown during a onehour special at 10 pm edt wednesday 
parts of the interview also were aired during another special 
broadcast at 1130 that program was the first of a series of 
latenight news programs that might evolve into a series to 
challenge abcs nightline the new york times reported quoting 
unidentified cbs executives 
the full interview was scheduled to be shown at 2 am edt 
thursday on nightwatch 
the rev jesse jackson who arrived in baghdad on wednesday has 
been promised an interview to be shown on the syndicated show 
inside edition said the shows executive producer 
rather theorized he was granted the interview because of 
proximity and persistence dees said

these women dont know when they are going home and they cant

it could go higher

fields including as nurses forklift operators jet maintenance

i know she is well taken care of valentine said of her

she would find him 
her children tricia 16 and shaka 15 were none too happy

the grisly slayings of five students 
have shaken to the core this gracious town in northern florida that 
leans heavily on the university of florida for its existence 
the community itself is a victim here said rick mulligan of 
the gainesville area chamber of commerce you hate to have a 
spotlight thrown on you for something like this 
the killings have left a sick feeling in the community but 
also instilled a sense of cooperation of community among the 
residents and among the students he said 
four women and a man have been found stabbed to death in 
offcampus apartments since sunday and three of the women were 
mutilated authorities said hundreds of students have locked their 
doors or run to their parents 
gainesville is home to 88000 permanent residents and 34000 
students many arriving for the first week of fall classes the 
university and its related facilities employ nearly 30 percent of 
the towns work force 
the university traces its beginnings to the towns founding in 
1853 and was formally established in 1906 with an enrollment of 102 
historians say that freezes in the late 1800s ended the towns 
brief tenure as a citrusgrowing center for generations the town 
was virtually dependent on the school for its survival but since 
the 1950s it has developed as a major healthcare center and 
attracted light industry 
four large hospitals including a veterans center provide jobs 
for 15 percent of residents 
our most important industry is education said mayor 
courtland collier but said mulligan the community is growing 
away from education we are not as strictly a college town as we 
used to be 
community leaders organized a rally wednesday for all those 
who are outraged fearful and in mourning about 100 marchers 
wearing black armbands and carrying flowers walked from the campus 
to the courthouse 
this series of killings is completely foreign to the 
city the mayor said wednesday but its a time of coming 
together for the people we will survive and well be the better 
for it there is no rampant panic in the streets 
alachua county commissioner kate barnes cautioned against the 
spread of rumors about gory aspects of the slayings or the motive 
police said there was no evidence that satanic cults or drugs were 
involved in the killings 
fear and rumors are our worst enemies she said adding that 
the homicides are bad enough without macabre imaginings

the army is behind schedule and over budget in 
its destruction of old chemical weapons but congress shares blame 
for some of the problems the general accounting office says 
in a report released wednesday the congressional investigative 
agency said the armys prototype disposal facility now in 
operation is 32 months behind schedule and will cost at least 190 
million more than 1985 estimates delays also will boost costs of 
storing chemical weapons by 33 million 
the gao said two laws passed by congress were largely 
responsible for delays and cost overruns although technical 
problems and poor contractor performance also caused problems at 
the prototype facility on a pacific island 
one of the statutes adopted in 1985 required destruction of 
all us chemical weapons causing the army to vastly expand a 
program that only was to dispose of m55 rockets with nerve agents 
the report said 
in addition a 1987 law ordered tests to make sure the weapon 
destruction did not harm the environment 
most of the increased estimated cost can be attributed to the 
two statutory requirements and the technical and contractor 
problems the report said 
rep john conyers dmich chairman of the house government 
operations committee said congress had given the defense 
department more than enough additional time to complete the 
task despite the program expansion and testing program ordered by 
lawmakers 
conyers was one of three lawmakers requesting the report on the 
facility at johnston island in the pacific ocean 
the delays at johnston are holding up construction of three us 
disposal sites that will rely on lessons learned from the island 
facility the sites are at anniston ala pine bluff ark and 
umatilla ore 
while fullscale operations at johnston were originally 
scheduled for february 1989 the date has been pushed back 32 
months to late september 1991 the report said 
despite the delay of a fullscale destruction program an army 
spokesman said wednesday that the prototype plant began disposing 
of its first chemical weapons july 1 
the spokesman lt col steve roy said the johnston island 
plant has destroyed more than 4000 pounds of nerve agents and more 
than 800 rockets filled with nerve agents in its nearly two months 
of operation 
existing stocks on johnston island and chemical weapons removed 
from europe should be destroyed at the facility by late 1994 he 
said 
chemical weapons stored at eight us locations are scheduled to 
be destroyed in this country by april 30 1997 
before congress expanded the program the army estimated the 
original cost of the johnston facility at 371 million the new 
estimate is 561 million but the figure would increase with 
additional delays the gao said 
the gao study was requested by conyers sen john glenn dohio 
chairman of the senate governmental affairs committee and rep 
earl hutto dfla chairman of the house armed services 
subcommittee on readiness

catfish farmers are cashing in on a growing 
american appetite for something besides red meat and poultry 
the latest agriculture department figures show however that 
other livestock producers are in no imminent danger of being routed 
by legions of catfish trucks headed for city markets 
according to a report by the departments economic research 
service the us farmraised catfish industry has matured and 
now is a major supplier to the national seafood market 
by last year for example sales of processed catfish had grown 
to 372 million from 36 million just a decade earlier 
catfish ranked only behind pollock salmon and cod in domestic 
landings of finfish species during 1989 the agency said in the 
september issue of agricultural outlook magazine today 
farmraised catfish are found in retail outlets across the 
country 
the surge in catfish production and sales is expected to 
continue this year and in 1991 sales to processors were up 12 
percent from a year earlier during the first half of 1990 and 
inventories of hatcheries and growers were up 17 percent 
mississippi delta states accounted for 90 percent of last years 
catfish production area 
but farmraised catfish production now is growing in other 
states the report said new processing plants are promoting 
production in florida texas and the carolinas 
as of early july usda said the surface area of ponds for 
catfish production was up 139 percent from a year earlier in the 
carolinas 83 percent in texas and 53 percent in florida 
these states account for only about 4 percent of total pond 
area the report said however additional pond area probably will 
be built because of recent increases in plant processing capacity 
despite rising output catfish prices have remained firm the 
report said processors paid an average of 79 cents per pound in 
june up from 75 cents a year earlier 
according to another usda report per capita consumption of fish 
and shellfish rose 5 percent in 1989 to an annual average of 157 
pounds that was up 42 pounds from 1971 
by comparison americans ate an average of 1347 pounds of red 
meat last year a retail weight equivalent the total included 689 
pounds of beef 632 pounds of pork 12 pounds of veal and 15 
pounds of lamb and mutton 
poultry consumption on a per capita basis was 858 pounds in 
1989 including 666 pounds of broilers

rising energy costs prompted by the mideast 
crisis are adding to production expenses this year but a new 
agriculture department analysis shows net farm income is still 
edging higher than earlier expected 
the iraq situation pushed the price of crude oil up sharply 
the report said wednesday if a price increase of 10 a barrel is 
maintained for the remainder of the year agricultural fuel 
expenses in 1990 will be 10 percent higher than in 1989 
earlier the departments economic research service had forecast 
a 5 percent increase in 1990 fuel costs 
but the report also said net cash income of farmers this year is 
expected to be record high in the range of 59 billion to 63 
billion up about onetenth from 1989 the previous high was 572 
billion in 1988 
the forecast for net cash income had been in the range of 55 
billion to 59 billion in recent months 
as used by the research agency net cash income measures the 
value of commodities sold in a calendar year plus government 
payments less outofpocket costs some commodities sold 
actually may have been produced in earlier years and stored until 
marketed 
in another method of accounting the report said net farm income 
may be in the range of 47 billion to 52 billion compared with 
the previous forecast of 47 billion to 51 billion last years 
was about 47 billion a downward revision of 2 billion from 
previous 1989 estimates 
net farm income is used to measure the value of agricultural 
production whether sold or stored in a calendar year plus 
government payments minus all costs including depreciation and 
other allowances 
the report said 1990 cash receipts for crops and livestock are 
expected to climb by 6 percent to 8 percent from last year direct 
government payments are down somewhat from 1989 however 
cash expenses were forecast to be up 1 percent to 3 percent from 
1989 those include higher costs of fuels marketing storage 
transportation and farm rents 
overall the report said the 1990 balance sheet reflects a 
strong position for us agriculture with rising asset values 
mostly land and steady debt 
the rise in energy prices will have negligible effect this year 
on the farm cost of fertilizer and other chemicals but will 
probably be more pronounced in 1991 because most application is in 
the spring the report said

the kuwaitis who fled their country 
in the iraqi invasion may be refugees but some now call fivestar 
hotels home 
they are among the most affluent displaced persons ever 
a municipal committee in this saudi city tries to fulfill their 
every need but has balked at requests for massages and visits to 
the hairdresser a birthday cake was approved because it qualified 
as food 
weeks of living in close proximity to hundreds of strangers is 
also beginning to fray on the nerves of some kuwaitis used to 
keeping their families sheltered behind villa walls in their 
oilrich emirate 
its never happened before that when families fled a country 
they lived in fivestar hotels said khaled alrashed a kuwaiti 
businessman now living in a luxury seaside hotel 
the saudi government is picking up the tab for the hotel rooms 
all meals and laundry it also is distributing between 133 and 
800 to penniless families medical care is free as will be 
schooling when it starts next month 
the center for assisting the refugees is housed in a room at the 
dammam municipal building where operations have dropped from 24 
hours a day to 16 
the committee of municipal workers has registered 80000 
refugees since iraq invaded on aug 2 up to 40000 more fled to 
other parts of the kingdom 
committee coordinator faisal althani says every available hotel 
room furnished apartment and municipal housing complex as well as 
55 schools have been filled with kuwaiti refugees 
those living in the schools have no kitchen facilities so 10 
catering firms are delivering 20000 meals a day 
for the first two weeks after the invasion the municipality 
served up to 4000 people lunch and dinner in the entrance hallway 
of its municipal building 
school starts in 20 days so the committee is furnishing 
hundreds of villas and more than 5000 apartments for the kuwaiti 
families 
by chance the municipality had just completed a massive housing 
complex for saudi citizens lacking the land to qualify for one of 
the governments 80000 housing loans 
one hotel said it sends the city a bill totalling nearly 19000 
a day for the 1000 kuwaiti refugees housed there but no one on 
the municipal committee wanted to talk about the cost of taking 
care of the refugees 
no one is worried about figuring it out at this point said 
committee member mansour almuhana you have to do what you have 
to do 
althani said people were signing for all kinds of things at the 
hotel some of which he refused a birthday cake got by but a 
massage and new hairdo were refused 
he said many kuwaiti families fled with two or three asian 
housemaids and the saudi government paid for 2000 airplane tickets 
to send them home 
despite the government grants some kuwaitis have been selling 
their gold jewelry and cars in order to be able to buy clothes and 
their own food 
the kuwaitis are grateful to the saudis but the constant living 
with strangers is beginning to cause tension 
workers at one luxury hotel said the police were called in three 
times this week to settle arguments and one kuwaiti upset over 
service in the coffee shop tried to hit the manager over the head 
with a perrier bottle 
most of them are not happy at the hotel said an assistant 
manager speaking on condition of anonymity the women and men have 
to mix and they dont like mixing he said 
kuwaiti women staying at one junior college have been asked not 
to leave their converted dormitories and school rooms after dark 
women traditionally do not wear veils in kuwait while those in 
religiously orthodox saudi arabia are almost always completely 
covered in accordance with moslem tradition 
the kuwaiti women were given floorlength abayas to wear but 
this has caused some tension kuwaiti men said 
when you were living happily in a house you have your own 
privacy you will not have your own privacy here said alrashed 
the kuwaiti businessman 
the converted schools usually have playgrounds and organized 
activities for the children the saudis have also distributed 
copies of the koran the islamic holy book and cassettes with 
readings from the koran or arabic literature 
there are few activities in the big hotels discussing the 
situation and watching home videos of the iraqi invasion and 
kuwaiti resistance are the favorite pastimes 
we have no projects except kuwait said one man

the national endowment for the arts faces a 
lawsuit charging that it supported hateful hostile and 
antireligious expression with a 15000 grant for a new york 
artists controversial exhibition 
the lawsuit was filed in us district court on wednesday by the 
rutherford institute of charlottesville va a nonprofit legal 
services organization on behalf of los angeles lawyer david 
fordyce who was described as a devout christian it was the 
third lawsuit filed in response to the neas antiobscenity policy 
fordyce accused the nea and its chairman john e frohnmayer of 
displaying open and notorious hostility toward religion in 
violation of the first amendment doctrine of separation of church 
and state 
the suit charges that the neasubsidized catalog for tongues 
of flame an exhibit of works by david wojnarowicz of new york 
includes an image depicting jesus christ as an intravenous drug 
user 
the suit says the catalog also includes the artists reference 
to roman catholic cardinal john oconnor of new york as a fat 
cannibal and the worlds most active liar about condoms and 
safer sex 
fordyce said nea support for the exhibition and catalog conveys 
a message of hate and animosity toward institutionalized 
religion endorsed by the federal government 
he asked the court for a permanent injunction prohibiting the 
federal arts agency from funding sponsoring and endorsing works 
which promote blasphemous and sacrilegious hate material 
the nea had no comment on the lawsuit 
the endowment already is the target of separate federal lawsuits 
in new york and los angeles challenging frohnmayers requirement 
that nea grant recipients sign an antiobscenity pledge as a 
condition for receiving federal money 
frohnmayer instituted the pledge last november after congress 
at the urging of sen jesse helms rnc and other conservative 
lawmakers amended the neas current 171 million budget to include 
a ban on federal support for works that may be deemed obscene 
wojnarowicz said by telephone from new york that the nea had an 
awful track record of supporting works by minority artists 
including homosexuals 
if this kind of heat comes from cult or extreme conservative 
religious groups over the few coins that finance minority 
expression then this country is in pretty bad shape he said 
the lawsuit also drew fire from barry blinderman director of 
university galleries at illinois state university which used the 
nea grant to mount the tongues of flame show last winter the 
exhibit is currently on display at the santa monica museum of art 
in california 
at a news conference after he filed the lawsuit rutherford 
institute president john w whitehead said religious people must 
no longer be the personal targets of cannon fire from national 
endowment projects 
in late june wojnarowicz won a court battle in new york against 
the rev donald wildmon and his conservative lobbying group the 
american family association which had reproduced fragments of his 
works in an antinea pamphlet mailed to members of congress church 
leaders and media outlets 
the federal judge in that case ruled that the pamphlet probably 
had damaged the artists reputation and the value of his works and 
ordered its publication halted

about 300 million a year in existing federal 
energy research money should be diverted into projects that could 
help fight global warming a panel of scientists says 
in a 127page report ordered by congress the national research 
council committee also said wednesday that the united states should 
consider launching a much larger research program to be ready if 
concerns about global warming intensify 
developing what the panel called backstop technologies would 
cost billions of dollars per year these are not economically 
viable now but could be needed if emissions of carbon dioxide and 
other greenhouse gases have to be cut by large amounts 
scientists say atmospheric buildups of carbon dioxide methane 
nitrous oxide chlorofluorocarbons and other gases mostly from 
burning of oil coal and other fossil fuels could cause a 
disastrous warming of the earths temperature 
the bush administration argues that there is still too much 
scientific uncertainty to warrant expensive steps such as a 
proposed worldwide ceiling on carbon dioxide emissions 
the research councils committee on alternative energy research 
and development strategies chaired by david l morrison of the iit 
research institute in chicago was asked to consider what policy 
moves should be made if the government decides to take action on 
global warming 
funds in the energy departments current research budget should 
be shifted to earmark about 300 million per year for projects to 
improve energy efficiency and encouraging adoption of technology 
that would cut greenhouse gas emissions the panel said 
these steps would make sense for other reasons even in the 
absence of concerns about global climate change it said 
the scientists said the energy department could reduce spending 
on research into fusion power fossil energy and other projects to 
get the money 
energy secretary james d watkins welcomed the report in a 
statement but said the departments current research projects 
should not be cut 
although we agree with the priorities highlighted by this 
study we believe that these priorities should not be met at the 
expense of other programs promising substantial longterm 
environmental and energy security benefits watkins said 
the committee did not make a precise cost estimate for what it 
called an insurance strategy for advanced research into renewable 
energy conservation nuclear energy and a range of other new ideas 
these alternative technologies would be developed to the level 
necessary to understand their costs and impacts if concerns about 
greenhouse gas emissions and climate change heighten the panel 
said

five slayings discovered on a florida campus 
show the need for congressional action to combat a wave of violence 
against women a senate committee chairman says 
it should not take such a grisly and horrifying incident for 
us to act sen joseph r biden jr ddel said tuesday we 
already know that young women are disproportionately victimized by 
violent crime 
biden said the five murders in gainesville fla dramatize 
just how vulnerable americas young women are as they return to 
campus 
biden commented as his judiciary committee heard two young 
victims of acquaintance rape appeal for help in fighting the 
problem 
the committee released results of a new study made on behalf of 
the american psychological association that said the chances of any 
woman being raped in her lifetime were one in five it said the 
odds of being raped by an acquaintance were one in six 
we are here to debunk the myth that real rape only happens 
when a man jumps out of the bushes and attacks an unsuspecting 
victim biden said in fact rape by someone the victim knows 
usually referred to as acquaintance rape is real rape and it is 
far more common and may be even more devastating to its survivors 
biden said there is growing support for legislation that would 
direct more federal resources into combatting violence against 
women 
witnesses before the committee included paralegal christine 
shunk who has twice been a rape victim 
in 1984 when she was a college freshman she was raped while 
being escorted home from a fraternity party by a man she believed 
to be a friend two years later she said she was raped at knife 
point by a stranger 
i have already been raped twice and i have survived ms 
shunk said i do not know how i would survive a third assault 
mentally you see being raped is like having your whole world 
turned upside down 
the 25yearold coatesville pa woman said she was plagued by 
guilt after the first attack because she had agreed to accompany 
the young man to his dormitory room to pick up his jacket before he 
escorted her home 
nicole snow 21 of new canaan conn said that the summer 
before her junior year in high school she was raped by a boyfriend 
she at first thought was my dream 
i thought he was a popular caring wonderful football player 
and he seemed crazy about me she said my dream was quickly 
shattered a month after our first date he changed my life 
forever by brutally raping me 
she said that afterward she pretended that it had not happened 
i continued my life robotically striving socially 
academically and athletically but inside there was a crying young 
girl ms snow said it took 3 years until i got the courage 
to seek therapy

us officials rushed to jordans border with iraq on wednesday 
to greet americans leaving iraq but no sign emerged that saddam 
hussein had carried out his pledge to free western women and 
children 
in new york 36 iraqi diplomats and their families left the 
country early thursday after being expelled 
two iraqi airways flights arrived in amman jordan from baghdad 
on wednesday but neither brought western hostages and although 
us ambassador roger harrison hurried to the border post of 
ruweishid northeast of amman to help greet americans none showed 
up 
i have no evidenceindicating that people have been allowed 
to leave white house spokesman roman popadiuk told reporters in 
washington 
iraq has said all women and children who wish to leave must have 
exit visas britain said wednesday britain also has been told that 
each of the foreign embassies must give iraq a list of their 
nationals who wish to leave said a british foreign office 
spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
in new york 91 iraqi men women and children boarded a royal 
jordanian airlines jet that took off for amman early thursday 
the state department expelled the diplomats in response to a 
series of iraqi moves including baghdads attempt to make the us 
embassy in kuwait close it also restricted the travel of the 19 
diplomats allowed to remain 
also wednesday japan announced an aid package to assist in 
multinational efforts to deter iraqi aggression japan plans to 
spend 1 billion on medics transportation and nonlethal aid for 
the multinational effort the top government spokesman chief 
cabinet secretary misoji sakamoto said thursday 
a defiant saddam meanwhile declared in a tv interview wednesday 
that america cannot defeat iraq adding i do not beg before 
anyone 
he told a newsman from french tv station tf1 that a victory 
for the united states is not realistic 
in an interview with cbs news in baghdad shot by iraqi tv 
saddam declared kuwait is part of iraq the legislative 
bodies in iraq have issued a clear decree saying that kuwait is an 
iraqi province 
nbc and cnn said us agencies particularly army special forces 
troops and the cia were helping the kuwaiti resistance in 
hitandrun attacks on iraqi occupiers no us troops were said to 
be involved but kuwaiti fighters based on the saudikuwait border 
were reported to be getting intelligence weapons radios advice 
and instruction from the united states 
a us diplomatic source confirmed the reports in general terms 
saying were aware of their action and were supporting them 
this source claimed to be unaware of details 
on tuesday the state department said iraq took nine more 
americans into custody in iraq and kuwait bringing to 70 the 
number rounded up and apparently moved to military installations as 
shields against a us attack 
nevertheless state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
said wednesday that if saddam carries out his promise to free the 
western women and children it will be a significant step in the 
right direction 
as the west waited to see what would happen to its hostages a 
white house official confirmed that the bush administration 
received a secret iraqi offer to free all captives and withdraw 
from kuwait if certain conditions were met 
the conditions were that the international trade embargo against 
iraq be lifted and baghdad be granted access to the persian gulf 
and sole control of an oil field that dips into kuwait according 
to newsday which broke the story 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
offer was rejected saddam told cbs that no such proposal was made 
iraqs us ambassador mohamed almashat officially notified 
the state department on wednesday of saddams decree that all women 
and children of foreign nationals would be allowed out of iraq 
almashat told reporters the americans would be allowed to leave 
through jordan or turkey but he gave no timetable for their 
departure 
it is not possible administratively that everybody go on the 
same day almashat said he said he did not know whether the 
iraqi government would provide aircraft to facilitate the 
departures 
cable news network quoted unidentified iraqi officials as saying 
an iraqi airways plane filled with westerners would leave baghdad 
for amman thursday 
almashat also said that once washington assures baghdad that 
the usled multinational force massing in saudi arabia and the 
persian gulf will not attack iraq then we are going to let even 
men out 
saddam previously offered to free all the roughly 21000 western 
hostages in iraq and kuwait if washington withdraws its forces from 
the region and guarantees the lifting of trade sanctions against 
iraq the united states rejected the offer 
about 3000 americans were trapped in kuwait and iraq on aug 2 
when iraqi forces overran its oilrich neighbor then annexed it 
the state department estimates that about 1000 of them were women 
and children 
on the diplomatic front un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar left for amman where he is to discuss the crisis on 
thursday with iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz 
the international trade embargo designed to force iraq to end 
its occupation of kuwait got an important boost from the opec oil 
cartel 
opec oil ministers approved a plan allowing saudi arabia 
venezuela and other member countries to pump more oil and help hold 
down crude prices one opec minister predicted the agreement could 
replace 3 million of the 4 million barrels of oil the day that 
disappeared from the world market because of the embargos on iraqi 
and kuwaiti oil 
that shortfall caused oil prices to skyrocket 
in an effort to rally the tens of thousands of us soldiers 
patrolling the saudi desert in scorching heat each day president 
bush on wednesday gave them a radio pep talk broadcast over armed 
forces radio 
bush called the persian gulf crisis one of the toughest 
military missions in modern memory and told the soldiers they 
stand on the front line against aggression and international 
lawlessness 
in the first major accident of the us deployment a cargo 
plane headed for the gulf crashed wednesday after taking off from 
ramstein air base in west germany killing nine us reservists and 
four active military personnel the plane was carrying medical 
supplies food and aircraft maintenance equipment the cause of the 
crash was under investigation 
air force officials said the reservists had volunteered for duty 
to help with the buildup

ultrasound scans on pregnant women can accurately 
detect spinal abnormalties and other severe birth defects without 
raising the risk of miscarriage the way amniocentesis does a study 
today concludes 
when blood tests signal the possibility of spina bifida and 
other serious problems doctors routinely perform amniocentesis a 
test that removes amniotic fluid for analysis this technique is 
generally safe but carries a small risk of triggering miscarriage 
the new research suggests that ultrasound which uses sound 
waves to take pictures of the fetus and carries no known risk is 
also a highly accurate way of checking for these birth defects 
we may have to modernize our way of thinking said dr beryl 
r benacerraf a coauthor of the study i wouldnt say that 
nobody has to have amniocentesis but women can choose they need 
to be involved in the decision and given the odds 
pregnant women are frequently given a blood test to check for 
elevated levels of alphafetoprotein while many things can cause 
this protein to be higher than normal there is a 1 percent chance 
that it means the baby has a defect 
to make sure the fetus is healthy doctors frequently withdraw a 
sample of amniotic fluid with a needle to see if it too contains 
elevated levels of alphafetoprotein its presence may indicate 
spina bifida abdominal wall malformations and other serious birth 
defects 
in the study researchers found that if a woman has an elevated 
alphafetoprotein level and a normal ultrasound scan there is a 
less than onetenth of 1 percent chance that her baby will have 
defects associated with the protein 
however if she opts for amniocentesis there is a half of 1 
percent risk that the test itself will terminate the pregnancy 
dr allan s nadel principal author of the study noted that 
some women may still want to rule out the slight risk of a birth 
defect even if that might also pose a small risk of losing their 
pregnancy 
the study was conducted at brigham and womens hospital in 
boston and published in the new england journal of medicine 
doctors reviewed the ultrasound findings of 51 fetuses with 
spina bifida and related abnormalities that were delivered or 
aborted at the hospital in every case ultrasound had correctly 
identified the birth defects 
however the doctors cautioned that ruling out these defects 
requires sophisticated ultrasound equipment in the hands of doctors 
who are well trained in its use they said this expertise is 
available in most large medical centers 
amniocentesis is also frequently recommended for pregnant women 
over age 35 to check for downs syndrome ultrasound is not 
routinely used to screen fetuses for this birth defect

the police officer of the nottoodistant 
future may be armed with new nonlethal weapons test kits that 
turn him into a curbside lab technician able to determine in 
seconds whether a suspect recently handled illegal drugs or 
explosives 
the kits are being developed for the fbi by two contractors and 
could be fieldtested as early as next month said dr dean 
fetterolf of the fbis forensic science research unit in quantico 
va 
the tests use antibodies produced in laboratory animals to 
detect the presence of as little as onemillionth of a gram of the 
target substance on skin desk tops luggage and other surfaces 
fetterolf said wednesday if the target substance is present the 
antibodies cause a portion of the kit to change color 
taking laboratory technology from a threehour analysis with a 
trained technician down to a 30second analysis that can be done by 
someone whos not trained as an expert in chemistry or science is 
not a trivial task fetterolf said 
fetterolf described the new test gear for drugs and similar 
new equipment to test for the presence of explosives at a news 
conference held in conjunction with a meeting of the american 
chemical society 
a main feature of the drug tests is that a police officer would 
only have to swab the palm of a suspects hand and add antibody 
solution to discover residues of cocaine or heroin 
its a much less intrusive method of testing for drug use than 
the traditional urine test fetterolf said 
and he said because antibodies are specific to the triggering 
substance other chemicals should not cause false positives 
that have plagued many current tests for example some urine tests 
indicate drug use if the subject has eaten a lot of poppy seeds 
the tests are calibrated to ignore the tiny but detectible 
amounts of cocaine on virtually all the 20 and 50 bills in 
circulation fetterolf said 
the drug kits are being developed under a 50000 contract by 
biometric systems inc of eden prairie minn a similar kit for 
certain explosives is being developed for 35000 by westinghouse 
corp in baltimore 
the first drug test kits 200 for cocaine and 200 for heroin 
should be delivered next month to the fbi for field tests to 
determine if changes are needed fetterolf said future kits might 
be developed for amphetamines and phencyclidine or pcp he said 
dr patrick guire biometrics vice president for research and 
development said the company is ahead of schedule and may ship the 
kits early 
guire said the kits will be massproduced and sold either by 
hycor biomedical of garden grove calif with which his company 
has a licensing agreement for other antibody tests or by 
biometric itself 
fetterolf predicted each would cost 7 to 8 but guire said he 
expected the cost to be about 5 apiece once mass production begins 
a sample test kit fetterolf displayed consisted of three small 
tubes of liquids and a plastic container smaller than a matchbook 
meanwhile the fbi soon will receive a prototype of an antibody 
test kit for explosives fetterolf said 
its very well documented in the scientific literature that 
someone who handles explosives and then picks up a briefcase 
will transfer the explosives from the outside of their hand to the 
briefcase he said 
the fbi has a procedure to detect tnt in traces as small as one 
part per billion and an antibody was developed in just the last 
few weeks for petn a major component of plastic explosives for as 
little as 30 parts per trillion the fbi scientist said

double murderer robert alton harris lost a 
round in a federal appeals court moving closer to californias 
first execution in 23 years 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals ruled 21 wednesday that 
harris has no right to a factfinding hearing on his claim that 
psychiatrists at his 1979 trial were incompetent for allegedly 
failing to detect a brain disorder 
harris cannot now obtain a second bite at the apple because 
he believes a new group of psychiatrists would offer a different 
defense the court said 
harris 37 was convicted of the 1978 murders of two san diego 
teenagers whose car he used in a 3000 bank robbery of the 286 
prisoners on californias death row he is the closest to the gas 
chamber no one has been executed in california since 1967 
defense lawyers can ask for reconsideration by an 11judge panel 
of the court a procedure the court has used several times from 
other states it can be authorized by a majority vote of the 
courts 27 active judges 
after that harris only remaining appeal is to the us supreme 
court which has ruled against him four times 
harris had been set to die april 3 but the execution was blocked 
by the appeals court with four days to spare 
no new execution date has been set 
attorney general john van de kamp said the case was getting 
toward the end of the line but he would not speculate on when 
harris might be put to death 
the american civil liberties union of northern california which 
furnished one of harris lawyers said of wednesdays decision 
to rule that a man should be put to death without even a 
hearing to examine the most essential elements of his defense is a 
travesty of justice and must be reversed

while others were still fashioning resolutions 
margaret thatcher dispatched military forces to the persian gulf to 
support washington in a crisis 
in the process the prime minister breathed new life into a 
special relationship widely regarded as having been overshadowed by 
the rise of germany and the end of ronald reagans presidency 
it was natural that britain with its vast economic stake in the 
persian gulf and its historic ties there should respond more 
vigorously than other european countries to iraqs seizure of 
kuwait 
that the response came in tandem with president bushs military 
buildup also seemed natural to mrs thatcher maintaining the 
special relationship with the united states is a pillar of foreign 
policy 
every time you think the special relationship is dead some 
event comes along and brings it back to life said robert 
skidelsky professor of international relations at warwick 
university in central england 
theres a whole network fortified by a common language that 
somehow goes on and that always seems to come into play in a 
crisis he said in an interview 
and theres the personal element mrs thatcher has found she 
can have most influence with the united states from a rather weak 
position by being absolutely reliable and that pays political 
dividends in washington 
the persian gulf crisis flies in the face of the fashionable 
view in britain that mrs thatcher has been marginalized by the 
upheavals in europe and her squabbles with the european community 
many analysts argued that with the collapse of the iron curtain 
the economic might and strategic position of a united germany would 
eclipse britain in washingtons eyes therefore they maintained 
mrs thatcher should get on board a united europe or be squeezed 
aside 
but europe quickly showed itself unable to produce a swift 
united military response to the persian gulf threat 
once again britain stood alone in backing a risky us 
endeavor just as it stood alone in 1986 in letting the americans 
use british bases for the bombing of libya 
no us ally actually refused to help all 12 european community 
nations supported sanctions against iraq france sent its military 
others sent ships turkey sealed an iraqi oil pipeline 
japan promised to help other nations pay for chartered ships and 
airplanes to ferry troops and arms to the persian gulf 
but bernard reich professor of political science at george 
washington university in washington dc maintains that what 
americans will remember is who was actually there the tv footage 
of british tornado and jaguar warplanes roaring into saudi arabia 
i think the question will be where were they reich said in 
a telephone interview for example where were the italians 
nobody will blame them but they are certainly not going to be 
rewarded 
opinion polls show strong support for mrs thatchers action 
83 percent in the first gallup poll after britain sent forces to 
the gulf it conflicts sharply with mrs thatchers otherwise poor 
ratings in the popularity polls 
this may well be a godsend for her said reich if i were 
her campaign manager i would now stress the image of a tough 
lady prepared to take action for what is right she and george bush 
are at the center of this and i think it is a real portrayal 
so far however her actions on the persian gulf dont seem to 
have affected the opposition labor partys near 18month lead in 
opinion polls now at between eight and 15 points 
when the crisis ends the main problem is still going to be 
the new european security order mark fielder an analyst at 
londons royal united services institute said in an interview 
then once again i suspect the new relationship between 
germany and the united states will reassert itself

cambodian guerrillas have endorsed a un 
plan to take over most of the government until free elections but 
the vietnameseinstalled cambodian authorities havent yet agreed 
the communist khmer rouge and two noncommunist guerrilla 
allies led by prince norodom sihanouk and former premier son sann 
endorsed the un plan wednesday 
chances of making the plan stick were strengthened when the 
united states soviet union and china which bankroll the warring 
parties all voted in favor tuesday at a meeting of the five 
permanent members of the security council 
the united states supports the two noncommunist rebel groups 
china arms the khmer rouge and the cambodian government gets aid 
from sovietsupported vietnam 
vietnam and the united states planned negotiations friday on 
cambodia and us diplomats said they would try to persuade hanoi 
to back the plan 
analysts in bangkok thailand believe the cambodian government 
wants to retain interim power and limit the un role to organizing 
the balloting 
the plan by the security councils five permanent members 
which also include france and britain would entail the united 
nations most extensive peacekeeping effort 
it could involve as many as 20000 un employees and cost 
billions of dollars its goal would be to restore peace and 
representative government to cambodia after decades of strife that 
have claimed more than a million lives 
the khmer rouge official in charge for foreign policy khieu 
samphan announced in new york on wednesday that his party fully 
supports the statement of the five permanent members of the un 
security council 
all the parties of the cambodian national resistance 
including the democratic kampuchea party khmer rouge have 
repeatedly expressed their full support for the works of the five 
permanent members of the united nations security council and viewed 
that the documents successively adopted by them should constitute 
the framework of a comprehensive political settlement of the 
cambodian conflict he said 
the documents by the five security council members call for the 
world body to supervise and control if necessary five key 
cambodian ministries defense foreign affairs finance public 
security and information 
the plan covers 
transitional arrangements regarding the administration of 
cambodia during the preelection period 
military arrangements during the transitional period 
elections under un auspices 
human rights protection 
international guarantees that cambodia will be nonaligned 
neutral and democratic 
the operation could cost the united nations up to 5 billion 
over one or two years and involve as many as 10000 peacekeeping 
troops and 10000 civilian personnel us officials say 
all the cambodian factions including the government of premier 
hun sen are to meet in jakarta indonesia next month 
vietnam invaded cambodia in december 1978 to oust the khmer 
rouge which had tried to transform the country at gunpoint into a 
radical agrarian society during its nearly fouryear rule the 
khmer rouge was responsible for the deaths of up to a million 
cambodians mostly by execution or starvation 
in july secretary of state james a baker iii announced that 
washington nervous about khmer rouge battlefield gains was ending 
its diplomatic recognition of the threeparty guerrilla alliance 
and would open talks with hanoi on ending the war 
the united states had previously followed the position taken by 
the united nations and most of the world of recognizing the 
resistance alliance as cambodias legitimate government

police chief mack vines today faced renewed calls 
to resign after being charged with lying to a panel investigating 
the fatal shooting of an unarmed man by an officer 
humpty dumpty is broken and i dont think theres any 
reasonable way of putting that all together again said city 
councilman jerry bartos 
prosecutors on wednesday charged the chief of the 2400member 
police force with seven counts of perjury each carrying up to 10 
years in prison 
district attorney john vance refused to detail the allegations 
against vines he said the charges will be presented to a grand 
jury on sept 10 
city manager jan hart named an acting chief and said vines 51 
who was appointed in 1988 will remain off the job he was 
suspended aug 3 and has been dogged by calls for his resignation 
for his part in the slaying probe 
vines said he welcomed the involvement of a grand jury 
i am confident that they will make a just decision he said 
in a statement 
city councilman glenn box said the charges would hamper vines 
leadership ability and the dallas police union president monica 
smith reiterated that we would like his resignation 
immediately 
i think it would be nearly impossible for chief vines to lead 
this police department with the confidence of the city into the 
future bartos said 
during his tenure vines angered veteran officers who accused 
him of favoring minorities in hiring and in his dealings with the 
public he won the support of minority leaders who now claim he is 
being persecuted vines is white 
the perjury charges stem from the fatal shooting last year of a 
mexican by officer patrick lemaire vines fired lemaire 17 days 
after the killing 
an administrative law judge who said vines failed to justify the 
firing reinstated lemaire last month during the administrative 
hearing an internal affairs detective testified his initial report 
on the shooting was altered 
that led the city manager to appoint a threemember panel to 
look into the detectives allegations and the speed with which 
lemaire was fired 
ms hart suspended vines and holliday after holliday told her 
vines called him at home the night before and tried to persuade him 
to downplay his testimony about the speed of vines firing of 
lemaire 
the panel decided the haste created a frenzied atmosphere 
conducive to mistakes and said that cast suspicion on lemaires 
suspension 
prosecutors said holliday was helpful in the investigation and 
ms hart lifted his suspension wednesday 
sam gonzales 49 a 26year veteran officer was named acting 
chief

a woman caught with more than a 
quarter pound of pure heroin she brought from thailand walked free 
today after a judge accepted that it was for personal use 
vivien kay stevenson 32 wept as judge david jones gave her an 
18month suspended sentence that includes provisions for two years 
of drug testing 
outside melbourne county court lawyers noted she probably would 
have faced a life jail term if she had been arrested in thailand 
ms stevenson was arrested by customs officials after a qantas 
flight from bangkok to melbourne on dec 12 she had pleaded guilty 
to importing 47 ounces of the drug 
jones said that at first glance it seemed inconceivable that 
such a large quantity of heroin with a street value of about 
250000 was merely for personal use 
however he said after hearing extensive evidence he was 
satisfied ms stevenson was stupidly and naively caught up in the 
drug world 
she had visited thailand several times to get stock for a 
handicraft business and had bought some marijuana for personal 
use jones said when marijuana was unavailable her supplier had 
offered heroin which she smoked 
ms stevenson said she planned to discard any unused heroin but 
decided to take it to australia after learning she had family 
problems the judge said

numbers quantify the fear eight or 
even 10 to an apartment for safety 4000 worried calls to a crisis 
hotline dozens of pleas for street lamps 90 officers on this 
small citys streets 
five students dead 
the toll of an apparent serial killer has changed the way 
everyone lives students at the university of florida and others 
said wednesday 
thousands of lights stay on all night unknown numbers of 
weapons have come out 
i stayed at a friends apartment last night and we had eight 
people there said linda helton 20 a junior from west palm 
beach we had eight baseball bats and we had knives and we had 
things blocking the doors 
todd silberman who said 10 people crammed in together in a 
onebedroom apartment has seen many people carrying weapons 
some have pistols a lot are carrying knives he said 
the business at sapps pawn and gun shop a few blocks from 
campus bore him out 
yesterday was probably the busiest day we ever had said 
butch ford whos been in the business for about 30 years but 
weve never had five murders in gainesville before 
he sold everything from 38caliber revolvers to shotguns to 
women men college students little old ladies he wouldnt 
say how many 
fear was a salesman too for gainesville regional utilities 
where up to three dozen requests for street lamps came in and more 
for street lamp repairs 
installations are being expedited because of the situation 
the murders were trying to get it done in two to three days 
said customer service manager linda smart 
porch bulbs floodlights even interior lamps burn at homes all 
nighti went home last night and ive never seen so many lights 
on in this town said john babb owner of the gainesville gym 
his is one of many businesses that would normally be busy as a 
new semester starts like others he complained sales are off 
substantially because many students have packed and left campus 
my door traffics down about 20 percent he said its off 
30 to 40 percent after dark 
on a normal night the hotline run by the alachua county crisis 
center gets 150 calls weve handled 4000 calls in the last 24 
hours director marshall knudson said wednesday 
the period he described began as people were learning that a 
fourth and fifth body had been found and that one of the victims 
was a man 
not 50 percent of the population but 100 percent was at 
risk said knudson a psychologist describing callers feelings 
and maybe it was even more random 
as the level of fear rose so did the rumors that callers sought 
to verify or better to have debunked 
many rumors were about additional bodies found others 
apparently grew out of news reports that some victims bodies were 
mutilated 
its like whats the worst thing you can imagine knudson 
said 
marty rogers was one of those answering the hotline early 
wednesday as phones buzzed in the background he described the 
callers a lot of scared kids a lot of scared everybody 
we have a city here with a lot of anxiety police chief 
wayland clifton said on the other hand i see people pulling 
together i havent seen people building fortresses i havent 
seen a mass exodus 
he offered numbers of his own to describe the fear his 
department has received up to 1400 calls per hour and with the 
addition of state troopers and others called in the force has 
nearly quadrupled 
on a typical evening wed have about 25 officers on the 
street right now weve got about 90 the police chief said 
the sight of patrol cars and traffic stops is common around town 
it is an imposition an officer walks up with a 45 on his 
hip clifton acknowledged but he said its necessary for the 
investigation and even those stopped understand 
the city and the university police came in for some criticism at 
a march and rally wednesday evening sponsored by the local chapter 
of the national organization for women and the gainesville womens 
health center 
speakers also echoed the call to courage on one marchers sign 
which said simply we are not afraid 
another read i am armed and angry it was carried by fran 
alshouse who said she sleeps with a semiautomatic pistol on her 
pillow it feels good she said she was one of 100 or so 
people who made the march 
in the avalanche of numbers that the tragedy has brought the 
only number missing is 1 
nobody said student linda helton is by themselves 
anymore

equal time to jacksons political rivals a federal official says 
jackson is attempting this week to interview iraqi president

program inside edition which is broadcast on the local 
nbcowned station wrctv 
jackson is a candidate for the district of columbias us 
senate shadow seat an unpaid lobbyist post for dc statehood 
news programs can claim exemption from federal equal opportunity 
commonly known as equal time rules if candidates are the 
subjects of bona fide newscasts documentaries or other types of

but because jackson will be an interviewer and not an

parents and students who inaccurately estimate 
college costs and fail to draw on all available sources of 
assistance may be prematurely slamming the door on higher 
education says sen edward m kennedy 
the massachusetts democrat who chairs the senate labor and 
human resources committee commented wednesday on a general 
accounting office report that said a review of nine studies and a 
gao analysis found students in grades 10 through 12 knew little 
about federal financial aid 
the studies generally revealed that parents had little idea of 
college costs most parents greatly overestimated costs or offered 
unrealistically low estimates ranging from a low of 2000 to a 
high of 60000 a year 
pell grants the largest aid program are available to all who 
qualify but a 1988 study by the council for advancement and 
support of education found 49 percent of the high school students 
polled incorrectly believed they were ineligible for aid to attend 
an expensive private school if their parents could afford a state 
school 
onethird of those polled also incorrectly believed financial 
aid is set aside solely for minority students and almost a quarter 
incorrectly believed that students with average grades dont 
qualify for financial aid

washington rightwing extremists are igniting an explosion 
of censorship attempts in the public schools but their success 
rate is slipping as school officials learn to handle the 
challenges an advocacy group says 
our research suggests that when censors encounter no 
resistance from the community they prevail said arthur j 
kropp president of people for the american way a liberal 
organization that focuses on constitutional liberty issues 
when they are met head on they generally lose 
the group said wednesday it had documented 244 attacks on 
academic freedom across the nation in the 198990 school year up 
from 172 incidents it cited in 198889 
this years total was the highest since the group began its 
annual survey in 1982 but it probably represents only a fraction 
of all the incidents that occurred the report said 
from novels to television programs to fine art to music to 
movies to textbooks we are witnessing an explosion of censorship 
an explosion sparked by the match of far right and religious right 
intolerance kropp said 
but the report also said only about onethird of the censorship 
attempts succeeded this year while the others were rejected by 
principals school boards or other officials 
in 198889 about 50 percent of the attempts succeeded

washington drivers in 27 states may be stopped at labor day 
weekend sobriety checkpoints says a private group that surveyed 
law enforcement agencies nationwide 
the proliferation of such roadside checkpoints follows a 
february supreme court ruling that allowed random checks for 
drunken drivers 
the american alliance for rights and responsibilities a new 
group that supports checkpoints said it contacted public safety 
officials in every state by telephone the organization had written 
all governors urging a start of the program this weekend 
the 20 states without plans for sobriety checks said they would 
step up patrols to catch drunken drivers during the weekend said 
roger conner alliance president three states hawaii iowa and 
nebraska failed to respond to the survey he said 
four states louisiana michigan oregon and vermont have 
ongoing litigation or court rulings based on state constitutions 
that prohibit checkpoints conner said 
police checking motorists for drunkenness generally have to 
delay a driver for only about 90 seconds he said 
the court ruled that the minimal intrusion for lawabiding 
motorists is outweighed by the benefit of preventing drunken 
driving alcohol figured in about half of the 46000 traffic 
fatalities last year

dont worry mom and dad surprisingly few 
schoolchildren trade the fruit in their lunch boxes for twinkies 
take the kids word for it 
of 400 children ages 612 queried in a nationwide gallup poll in 
august 77 percent said they eat the fruit their parents pack for 
them five percent said they trade or throw it away others said 
that what they do depends on the fruit 
it could be that there is simply less junk food to trade for 
the survey commissioned by the florida department of citrus 
found that 57 percent of 414 parents who were polled said they pack 
fruit daily in lunch boxes four percent of parents said they never 
packed fruit 
in addition 27 percent of the parents said the lunches they 
pack are healthier than lunches their own parents gave them and 85 
percent said they would like to eat what they pack for their 
childrens lunches 
leann birch a university of illinois professor who has 
specialized in childrens eating habits for 15 years thinks the 
popularity of fruit is not surprising and said children tend to 
choose familiar foods over novel ones 
i think most kids like fruit fruit is very high in sugar and 
sweetness is one of the things we come into the world liking she 
said in a telephone interview 
if you expose a child to fruit and not as much to twinkies 
for example other things being equal youll find the child will 
develop a liking for fruits 
apples followed by oranges and bananas were the fruit most 
often packed in lunches and the fruit children perceived as 
healthiest the children said they have fruit an average of 345 
times a week 
the lack of lunchroom wheeling and dealing may be due to 
parents increased awareness of healthy foods said vicki lansky 
author of several books about food and children 
i think probably more people are putting more apples in 
there she said from her office in deephaven minn 
among the surveys other findings 
virtually all the children said they usually get a sandwich in 
their lunches 
asked what drinks they would include in their favorite 
lunches 60 percent of the children picked soda or koolaid 
however milk was the most common beverage they got for lunch 
mentioned by 26 percent of the respondents 
asked what theyd pack in a healthy lunch the children 
selected in order fruit sandwiches potato chips and milk 
when parents include treats in lunches 45 percent said they 
pack cookies followed by snack cakes and chips 
the survey screened out children who buy lunch at school and 
had a margin of error of 49 percentage points

international passengers at 15 us airports 
routinely waited two hours or more to clear customs this summer and 
government action is needed to correct the problem said the 
president of an airline trade association 
one example said robert aaronson of the air transport 
association was an incident last sunday in which passengers on a 
swissair flight from zurich had to wait five hours to get out of 
the los angeles terminal 
while the swissair passengers were delayed longer than most 
such inhumane inconveniences are becoming more common said 
aaronson whose group represents air carriers 
airlines and airports lose money because of the delays said 
aaronson and other aviation officials who held a wednesday news 
conference angry passengers complain about being kept waiting on 
planes because of full customs areas backedup flights and other 
problems they said 
thats some welcome mat for millions of tourists who visit our 
country each year aaronson said the problem has become so 
serious that it is likely to start discouraging tourism he said 
industry officials proposed that a current 5 immigration charge 
be extended to travelers from canada mexico and the caribbean who 
are currently exempt the additional 80 million could pay for 
1200 additional inspectors they said 
aaronsons group the airport operators council international 
and the travel industry association are proposing that congress 
require federal inspection agencies to abide by a 45minute maximum 
processing standard established by the international civil aviation 
organization 
obviously the united states is nowhere near meeting it at 
peak travel time aaronson said 
the groups also recommended that the administration allow more 
inspection of arriving passengers at foreign airports before they 
depart extend a visa waiver program with a decrease in the amount 
of paperwork passengers are required to fill out and set up a 
governmentindustry task force to look at a model program for 
clearing passengers at a us airport 
airport immigration operations blamed for the worst delays this 
summer included those at boston logan chicago ohare minneapolis

latin american debtor nations failed 
to honor 18 billion in financial obligations last year as the 
regions foreign debt continued to climb despite efforts to curb 
it a new study says 
by the end of last year 27 latin american nations had a 
combined foreign debt of 4346 billion including 645 billion 
owed by communist cuba according to the study by the caracasbased 
latin american economic system 
that amount is 15 percent higher than 1988s total of 4275 
billion the study said 
the latin american economic system the only regional 
organization that includes cuba issued the document in preparation 
for a ministerial meeting to be held in caracas next week 
since its formation in 1975 as a forum for latin american 
countries to debate economic issues the organization has focused 
on discussing foreign debt problems and promoting regional economic 
integration 
next weeks meeting also is scheduled to discuss president 
bushs initiative to create a continental freetrade zone the 
initiative launched in june has been welcomed warmly by most 
latin american leaders the meeting will be the first time the 
region debates the plan collectively 
but debt still remains latin americas main concern 
since the outbreak of the debt crisis in 1982 latin american 
nations paid creditors mostly us banks more than 250 billion 
but in new loans during the same period they barely received 50 
billion the survey says 
debt represents 509 percent of the regions total domestic 
product and is almost three times the value of all regional exports 
combined in one year 
interest payments alone represented 23 percent of the regions 
annual export revenue last year the study says 
debts among latin american nations also are a problem latin 
american nations owe each other 11 billion the main creditor 
nations are brazil mexico argentina and venezuela also the 
regions most indebted countries the study found 
despite debtrelief programs such as one by us treasury 
secretary nicholas brady latin american financial horizons are 
still stormy the study said 
the organization called bradys plan a significant step but 
insufficient so far only mexico costa rica and venezuela have 
completed refinancing programs under the proposal 
bradys plan offered incentives for us commercial banks to 
write off some of their 13 trillion in third world debt but did 
not address the debt owed to the governments of the united states 
and other industrial nations 
bush in june unveiled a plan to forgive part of 12 billion owed 
by latin american and caribbean nations to the us government he 
said the united states would work with western european nations and 
japan to channel up to 300 million annually to latin america to 
spur foreign investment 
most economic indicators place the region in a critical 
financial situation the study says 
while nine countries could not meet their financial obligations 
and overdue amounts totaled 1801 billion last year only eight 
could service their debt regularly it says 
countries overdue and the amounts they owed were brazil 584 
billion argentina 325 billion ecuador 119 billion peru 
586 billion panama 733 million costa rica 400 million 
dominican republic 379 million bolivia 248 million and 
paraguay 107 million 
chile colombia jamaica el salvador mexico trinidad and 
tobago uruguay and venezuela were able to service their debt 
regularly the study says

after a 20year battle an inventor with the 
habits of a monk has received a patent that could make him a rich 
man assure him a place in the history of the information age and 
spell trouble for the computer industry 
gilbert hyatt a 52yearold engineer received the patent july 
17 for a singlechip computer he invented in 1968 
the patent appears to cover chips in everything from pocket 
calculators to cars to phones to electronic dishwashers but 
experts disagreed on whether it applies to all microprocessor chips 
and millions of personal computers based on them 
hyatt who lives in suburban la palma battled with the us 
patent office for two decades before he was granted the patent but 
didnt even crack open a bottle of wine when he learned of the 
decision 
i dont have time to do anything like that he said 
wednesday i have a lot of randd work to do and i dont 
drink 
hyatt who doesnt smoke either works 14 hours a day seven 
days a week he doesnt take vacations 
he said he hopes to negotiate licenses under which electronics 
companies will pay him royalties for using his invention but any 
money will go toward expanding his laboratory near his home and 
perhaps hiring researchers a departure from his solitary work 
habits he said 
the patent appears broad enough to affect many companies said 
roger borovoy who was general counsel at santa clarabased intel 
when it received microprocessor patents in 1973 
it spells trouble borovoy said 
daniel l klesken an analyst for prudential bache research 
said that a 05 percent royalty on computer giant intel corps 
yearly revenues would yield 15 million a 2 percent royalty would 
bring him 60 million the comparable figures for motorola inc are 
7 million and 28 million he said 
experts however predicted hyatt would face a stiff fight from 
big companies that hold patents on chips 
twenty years after the fact its going to be hard for him to 
collect anything right away said tim bajarin an industry 
consultant in santa clara 
placing the power of a computer on a single chip of silicon 
allowed the invention of the pocket calculator the personal 
computer and numerous other products 
the invention of the microchip is frequently credited to a team 
of intel engineers that included ted hoff federico faggin and stan 
mazor they began working on the idea in 1969 although intels 
chip wasnt shipped until 1971 texas instruments inc also entered 
the market in the early 1970s 
intel spokesman gordon casey said lawyers for the company still 
were studying the 80page patent document to determine what it 
covers 
hyatt began working on the technology at micro computer inc 
which he founded in 1968 the company grew to about 25 employees 
before going out of business in 1971 he said 
the work i did at micro computer inc is the forerunner of the 
pcs hyatt said i dont know if all pcs are using the same 
technology in the patents but they sure stem from the work i did 
he said he is not bitter about seeing his invention widely used 
without financial gain to him in the years since he filed his 
claim and he will not seek retroactive payments thats how 
business works he said 
the biggest loser he said has been the industry keeping me 
poor and tight has kept really marvelous technology out of the 
market he said 
bajarin said the patent assures hyatt a place in computer 
history 
he can lay claim to being a forefather of the processor 
bajarin said i was made aware of this case over 10 years ago 
our comment was at that time show us a patent well now hes 
got the patent

inmates at rikers island jail said guards lined 
them up and bludgeoned them with nightsticks in a melee that left a 
corridor spattered with blood and several prisoners with fractured 
skulls and other broken bones 
a state watchdog panel in albany backed up the prisoners 
allegations ruling that the guards used excessive force in putting 
down an uprising aug 14 
the uprising began as guards demanding more authority to use 
force were ending a twoday blockade of the jail that left the jail 
shortstaffed 
guards claimed they struck the inmates in selfdefense during 
the uprising but the inmates shouting through glass partitions to 
reporters touring the jail wednesday for the first time since the 
incident told a different story 
it was horrible horrific brutal said victor lantey 50 
chairman of the inmate council i saw heads busted eyes swollen 
up ribs broken it was excessive 
lantey said there was a massive amount of blood in the 
corridors 
charges that inmates destroyed property were trumped up to 
explain the injuries the prisoners suffered other council members 
said 
the hallway was clean and freshly painted wednesday 
corrections commissioner allyn sielaff who took over the city 
jail system in march declined to comment on the allegations of 
brutality because the riot is being investigated by the city 
department of investigation 
correction officials also revealed a shakeup in command a new 
warden and deputy warden were brought in last week at the sector 
where the melee occurred 
william mcmahon chairman of the state commission on correction 
said 144 inmates and 18 guards were injured in the melee two or 
three inmates required neurosurgery 
some prisoners suffered defensive injuries like broken arms and 
skull damage he said 
correction officers used force that was far in excess of what 
was reasonable and necessary to establish control of inmates and 
defend themselves mcmahon said the numbers of officers and 
inmates injured and the nature of their injuries are grossly 
disproportionate 
other inmates handed reporters copies of their infraction 
notices from that night forms filled out by guards detailing 
alleged inmate wrongdoing an inmate charged with smashing windows 
was subdued with batons body holds punches all parts of 
body one form said 
i got hit with a nightstick so hard they nearly tore my finger 
off said ronald king 30 holding up his bandaged right hand 
king said he was standing with his hands on his head when a 
guard smashed him with the stick the inmates had been forced from 
their beds on an upper floor by tear gas and by the guards he said 
whitaker 35 said the first indication the inmates had of an 
impending assault was when guards began moving through the cells 
taking blankets coats and other items they could use to absorb any 
blows

prime minister toshiki kaifu heartened president 
bush today with a telephone call telling him japan will initially 
spend 1 billion on the multinational effort to isolate iraq 
government officials said 
the united states had pressed for concrete japanese military aid 
but had to settle for what amounted mostly to financial aid 
including potentially generous assistance to countries hurt by the 
embargo on trade with iraq 
turkey egypt and jordan were singled out as nations that will 
get substantial economic assistance though the amounts and 
details have yet to be worked out 
bush told kaifu in their conversation that japans assistance 
would be favorably viewed in the united states according to an 
official of the prime ministers office who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
it was the second phone conversation between the two leaders in 
as many days to discuss japans role in aiding the forces arrayed 
in the middle east to stop any aggression by iraq after its 
invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
with the invasion iraq has cornered a total of 20 percent of 
the worlds oil reserves and japan imports virtually all of its 
oil 
japans 1 billion will cover a medical team of about 100 
people transportation of food water and medical supplies by 
chartered civil aircraft and ships and the provision of water air 
conditioners and housing units for forces in the persian gulf 
region 
also kaifu on wednesday mentioned 10 million in aid for people 
who have fled iraq and kuwait to jordan 
additional money will go to middle eastern countries suffering 
financially because of the unordered embargo on trade with iraq 
according to a foreign ministry official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the official declined to give a figure on that kind of aid 
us ambassador michael h armacost who had been urging a 
military contribution from tokyo issued a brief statement today 
saying the aid package was most welcome 
i particularly appreciate the announcement that japan will 
make a major contribution to the multinational force and provide 
substantial assistance to the countries most aeffected by iraqs 
invasion and occupation of kuwait 
in announcing the package wednesday night kaifu ruled out a 
role for japans military 
but tokyo will help other nations pay for chartered ships and 
airplanes that could be used to ferry troops and arms to the 
persian gulf the united states had urged tokyo to provide such 
military transportation itself 
we did everything we could within the boundary of the 
constitution kaifu said when asked if he thought the proposal 
would satisfy washington 
the united states has been seeking assistance from allies to 
help foot the bill for the massive usled military buildup in 
saudi arabia that began in reaction the the iraqi invasion 
washington has estimated the us cost of the buildup will reach 
25 billion by the end of september 
although japan quickly joined the embargo on trade with iraq a 
further response to the crisis was slowed by a debate over what is 
permissible under japans constitution 
kaifu acknowledged that pressure was increasing on japan to act 
if our response was delayed any further i was afraid we would 
give the impression to the world that japan is not doing anything 
about this serious problem he said we cant afford to be 
isolated from the rest of the world 
japan relies on middle east imports for about 70 percent of its 
needs about 12 percent of japans oil needs came from iraq and 
kuwait in the first quarter of 1990

indian barricades started coming down 
peacefully at a bridge into montreal but mohawk warriors say their 
confrontation with authorities isnt over in this quebec village 
after 50 days of armed standoff that began in oka on july 11 
with a bungled police assault on a mohawk barricade the situation 
showed the first positive signs of resolution 
masked mohawks on wednesday helped soldiers tear down barricades 
set up at the mercier bridge which connects montreal with suburbs 
on the southern shore of the st lawrence river 
residents of several south shore communities cheered wildly as 
wrecked cars concrete blocks and mounds of earth were pushed aside 
the barricades had gone up in sympathy with mohawk barricades 
thrown up in in oka 18 miles west of montreal nearly two months 
ago to protest plans to expand a golf course onto land the mohawks 
claim is theirs 
this place holds the key to everything mohawk dan david 
said wednesday at the barricade overlooking the village of oka and 
the canadian army installations below 
everybody knows that this is where it started and this is 
where it will end david said as armed indians and reporters 
alike scrambled to find out the latest information on the situation 
at mercier bridge 
the ostensible reason for the mohawk uprising expansion of the 
golf course was settled when the federal government purchased the 
land and said it would turn it over to the indians but militants 
seized the situation to air a much wider range of indian grievances 
against the government including demands for sovereignty 
tensions had been near the boiling point since monday when 
quebec premier robert bourassa broke off talks with the mohawks and 
ordered the army to tear down the barricades as the army made its 
tactical plans lastditch negotiations were launched at a suburban 
hotel 
early this morning it was still unclear exactly where and how 
the breakthrough came but after meeting in front of the bridge 
barricade soldiers and unarmed members of the mohawks militant 
warriors society began removing the barrier 
the sevenweek blockade has forced commuters living in 
chateauguay and other south shore communities to make long detours 
to get to work on the island of montreal as the conflict wore on 
tempers wore thin 
chateauguay residents first vented their frustrations on police 
in three nights of vicious rioting and increasingly against 
mohawk civilians on the adjacent kahnawake reservation 
though some of the barriers came down traffic still was not 
moving either down the approach roads or across the vital bridge 
in suburban dorval government and indian negotiators said they 
had made progress and would continue into the night it was the 
first note of optimism in many weeks 
but at oka the optimism was tempered by lack of precise 
knowledge about what was happening at kahnawake and determination 
not to give up the struggle 
were going to be here when they the army get here said a 
20yearold warrior who calls himself hunter 
hunter an american mohawk and a former student at the 
university of minnesota said the decision on how to react to any 
army move would be made at the last minute 
the army has said it will not fire first under any 
circumstances the mohawks have said they will not fire first 
the indians manning the barricades were asked what would happen 
if soldiers marched up the hill to carry out bourassas orders to 
tear down the barricade the soldiers not shooting the indians 
not shooting but the barricade slowing starting to move in front 
of bulldozers 
thats gonna be wild huh said a smiling warrior called 
black jack peering through blue sunglasses and sucking on a soda 
at this point its difficult to measure the residue of 
resentment felt by south shore residents 
violent incidents and anger that exploded as the confrontation 
wore on will take time to forget and what had been a large store of 
sympathy for the cause of canadian natives began to evaporate in 
many quarters 
im worried about the future said bob grant a chateauguay 
resident its going to take years and years for people in 
chateauguay to learn to get along with the mohawks again

sri lanka will stop selling tea to 
iraq in compliance with sanctions imposed by the united nations as 
punishment for iraqs seizure of kuwait a cabinet minister said 
today 
we have got clarification from the un that tea cannot be an 
exception to the sanctions of food items to iraq said plantation 
minister ranjan wijeratne 
sri lanka had hoped that it would be permitted to continue 
selling tea to iraq its largest single customer 
the un decision may be moot on monday iraqi purchased just 
100 tons of tea at the sri lankan auction onefifth its normal 
level and at tuesdays auction iraq whose shipping is now made 
difficult by enforcement of the unordered ban on trade settled 
its outstanding bills but made no new bids 
wijeratne who is also the deputy defense minister had said 
earlier that sri lanka hoped tea would be exempted from the embargo 
we have now received clarification and decided to comply 
wijeratne said we cannot defy the un resolution because there 
can be serious repercussion 
last year iraq purchased 30000 tons of sri lankan tea nearly 
24 percent of the indian ocean islands export crop egypt buys 
more tea than iraq but purchases are made by several individual 
companies 
bangladesh another of iraqs chief tea sources barred iraqi 
buyers from its tea auctions earlier in the week

a prosecutor whose nomination to the superior 
court bench had been held up for months by a excon on an obscure 
state board was rejected by the panel on the grounds she lacked the 
temperament to be a judge 
the executive council voted 54 on wednesday against confirming 
diane kottmyer 44 an assistant us attorney who gained a 
reputation prosecuting mobsters and corrupt police officers gov 
michael s dukakis had nominated her 
normally nearly all the councils work in examining state 
expenditures and judicial appointees is routine elected every four 
years it is a holdover from colonial days originally intended to 
check the power of the royal governor 
a felon who serves on the council joseph jo jo langone had 
held up a vote on ms kottmyers nomination since march langone 
represents the district in which she lives and thus was in charge 
of bringing up the nomination 
i just believe she hates italians and thats it langone 
said wednesday 
the 73yearold undertaker initially suspected ms kottmyer had 
played a role in his sixmonth sentence for assaulting a drug 
investigator in 1971 
though he later learned ms kottmyer had nothing to do with the 
case she clerked for the judge who sentenced langone but not 
until 1974 he pledged to stop her nomination 
several other councilors said they had received anonymous 
complaints from defense lawyers that ms kottmyer lacked the 
temperament to be a judge 
councilor rosemary tierney said she was told ms kottmyer was 
humorless and a headhunter who has contempt for the defense 
the councils objections are that diane kottmyer is an 
aggressive prosecutor responded dukakis aide steve crawford 
the governor believes and the people of this state believe that 
those are the kinds of judges we want on the bench 
crawford said no decision had been made on whether to resubmit 
ms kottmyers name for confirmation

saudi arabias civil defense 
organization is preparing for the worst in the persian gulf crisis 
including an iraqi chemical weapons attack 
the group has been educating hundreds of volunteers in weeklong 
crash courses that began after iraq invaded neighboring kuwait aug 
2 and massed tens of thousands of troops on the saudi border 
col mohammed almagrabi the civil defense chief in saudi 
arabias oilrich eastern province expressed confident that most 
people would be safe if they followed civil defense instructions 
at dammams civil defense center more than 200 men undergo 
training every week magrabi said in an interview 
the saudis civil defence organization combines firefighters 
rescue teams and other emergency services but the fear that iraqi 
president saddam hussein will send surfacetosurface missiles with 
chemical warheads deep into saudi arabia is foremost in saudis 
minds 
any iraqi missiles fired from occupied kuwait would reach 
eastern province and even the capital riyadh to the south within 
minutes 
magrabi said saudi and us defense systems now in place should 
be able to destroy incoming iraqi missiles before they reach their 
targets but he acknowledged that one or two might get through 
civil defense has focused on developing a warning system to give 
the countrys estimated 12 million people at least a fiveminute 
warning of an attack 
the organization has a hotline to the air force radar control 
center magrabi said once civil defense is informed of an attack 
it will broadcast a warning on radio and television and sound 
sirens many of which are now mounted on fourwheel drive vehicles 
all fulltime civil defense personnel have been outfitted with 
gas masks and protective suits but magrabi hopes to acquire enough 
masks to begin handing them out to the rest of the population 
the saudis have ordered millions of gas masks from manufacturers 
in the united states and britain 
civil defense is also supplied with atropine a nerve gas 
antidote 
in the event of an iraqi attack the organization has planned 
major relocation operations 
if khafji which lies on the border with occupied kuwait were 
attacked civil defense would try to transport the population to a 
tent city 90 miles away magrabi said 
he said civil defense has similar plans for other major cities 
that are potential targets

lyrics about murder rape robbery and 
dismemberment have scared off a record company from handling an 
album by the rap group the geto boys 
the decision by geffen records has stirred accusations of 
censorship and racism that were raised earlier this year when an 
album by 2 live crew was declared obscene in florida and members of 
the rap group were arrested 
geffen said its decision earlier this month to back out was 
based on lyrics in the geto boys that glamorize violence 
racism and misogyny 
i was flabbergasted that people would describe violence that 
graphically in music said bryn bridenthal a geffen vice 
president people will think this is like 2 live crew which is 
kind of silly just pure sex i was frightened by this 
the houstonbased band accused geffen of a double standard that 
some in the industry suggested is based on skin color not song 
content 
geffen also records artists such as guns n roses which has 
been accused of racism and homophobia in its lyrics and 
distributes andrew dice clay whose act has come under attack from 
women minorities and homosexuals 
you have to wonder if this inconsistency borders on racism 
rap publicist bill adler said 
its easier to single out a black group on a small label than 
any white group said debbie bennett a spokeswomen for 2 live 
crews luke records 
albums such as 2 live crews as nasty as they wanna be led 
the louisiana legislature to pass a bill requiring warning labels 
on recordings with potentially offensive lyrics gov buddy roemer 
vetoed it as unconstitutional 
geto boys lead rapper bushwick bill said his lyrics reflect 
houstons destitute fifth ward 
the groups spokeswoman heidi robinson said there are 
reasons for the songs theyve written she added to dismiss 
them as four guys doing this for shock value is to take them simply 
at face value 
robinson said the group wants to put money into a boys club and 
encourages black youngsters to get an education she also said the 
group has positive lyrics citing the antidrug life in the fast 
lane 
but womens rights groups are appalled by such rhymes as her 
bodys beautiful so im thinking rape shouldnt have had her 
curtains open so thats her fate 
francoise jacobsohn president of the new york chapter of the 
national organization for women praised geffens decision this 
art perpetuates and makes acceptable certain violence against 
women we think that is abhorrent she said 
but she questioned why the geto boys were singled out we 
think the same set of rules should apply to andrew dice clay

a rapist who forces his elderly 
victims to pose for lewd photos and lectures them about inviting 
attack by inadequately securing their homes has claimed his fourth 
victim police said 
all the attacks have occurred in the last year in one section of 
the city police said the women ranged in age from 64 to 86 
each victim was awakened in the early morning blindfolded and 
photographed in obscene poses before being raped and in each case 
the man unplugged or cut telephone lines police sgt dave geyer 
said wednesday 
a 73yearold woman was attacked early tuesday in the most 
recent attack police said in the other cases the man attacked on 
a sunday morning and stole cash 
a 75yearold woman avoided becoming a victim earlier this year 
by pushing an alarm button in her home and scaring off the rapist 
geyer said 
police said they believe the same man committed all four rapes 
because of the method of the attack and the womens description of 
the rapist 
the man apparently gets in through windows and doors police 
said 
we are convinced that there are a lot of attacks that have 
occurred that we dont know about geyer said he uses a 
psychological ploy on the victims to cause them to believe theyre 
responsible for the attack which makes them less likely to report 
it

prime minister margaret thatcher of 
britain rebuked most of her western european allies today saying 
they are relying on the united states to defend their interests in 
the persian gulf 
the western allies cannot expect the us to go on bearing 
major military and defense burdens worldwide acting in effect as 
the worlds policemen mrs thatcher told a conference of 
european conservative party leaders 
she said european countries have shown excellent solidarity in 
protecting each others citizens and in trying to keep open our 
embassies in kuwait 
but in defense terms the european response was much slower and 
more patchy she said the only countries in europe which have 
done significantly more than the minimum are britain and france 
italy west germany greece spain belgium and the netherlands 
have sent or plan to send warships or minesweepers to the region in 
support 
mrs thatcher thanked the united states and president bush for 
giving leadership and moving rapidly and decisively in 
protecting western interests in the gulf 
she spoke on the first day of a conference of 10 european prime 
ministers and about 30 leaders of conservative and christian 
democratic parties that form the european democratic union 
british foreign secretary douglas hurd said today that he doubts 
iraqi president saddam hussein could hold on to power if he 
complies with united nations resolutions that aim to force iraq to 
withdraw from kuwait 
hurd said however that he believes there is a reasonable 
chance that economic sanctions will achieve un objectives 
without any resort to force 
i dont myself think that saddam would find it easy to 
survive withdrawal from kuwait hurd said in an interview with 
bbc radio 
iraq seized kuwait on aug 2 in a lightning invasion

other doortodoor workers fear being attacked by residents 
terrified the killer of five college students may be knocking at 
the door 
deliverers have been told to take precautions because of the 
weapons their customers might wield 
they are more nervous of the customers than they are of this 
person greg sausaman owner of three dominos pizza franchises 
said of the student killer heaven forbid you knock on the wrong 
door right now 
the drivers have been instructed that if anything looks 
suspicious not to even get out of their car he said wednesday

deliveries to identify drivers by name and appearance and honking 
their horns on arrival 
at rocky rococo pizza employees said people were asking for 
descriptions of delivery drivers 
i had some girls that i delivered to that i didnt know if 
theyd open the door said geoffrey dunnam they were scared 
and i knew i was scared 
after each delivery customers and dunnam exchanged a be

to make sure that all of our carriers get back all right from their 
routes said gainesville postal supervisor james hardy 
the gainesville sun had planned to promote newspaper

who flew into jordan today aboard the daily morning iraqi airways 
flight 
the others were asians and arabs 
the american said he slipped out of iraq after lying about his 
nationality iraqi officials have been holding westerners as human 
shields against us and other forces assembling in the persian 
gulf region since iraq invaded kuwait 
jn sharma 55 an agricultural engineer of idaho falls idaho 
told reporters on arrival that he had spent three weeks in hiding

lentils he said he said he hid his american passport and left 
iraq using an indian travel document

shirt i nearly died of fright he said 
he burst into laughter when asked whether he told the iraqis 
that he was an american 
the british girl may barakat was on the verge of tears as she

survivors of northern illinois deadly 
storm say it struck virtually without warning and a weather 
forecaster said that even when there are warnings in most cases 
its too late 
your chances of being warned before a tornado hits arent all 
that great national weather service meteorologist greg dickey 
said wednesday pointing out that the notice comes only after a 
tornado has been sighted 
multiple tornadoes tuesday left at least 24 dead and more than 
300 injured 
we didnt get any warning said plainfield police chief don 
bennett 
the tornadoes that swooped into plainfield appeared out of a 
single thunderstorm that rumbled across northern illinois for about 
two hours spitting hail 2 to 3 inches in diameter as it went 
the weather service issued a severe thunderstorm watch at about 
130 pm as the storm approached rockford then followed it up 
with more notices as the storm moved southeast warning of 
dangerous lightning heavy rain and strong winds 
remember severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do 
produce a tornado with little or no advance warning so be on 
the lookout read one warning 
but the storm seemed to be limited to hail and high winds 
the system seemed to have gotten less threatening said john 
plunk director of the illinois emergency services and disaster 
agency then this hit out of the blue when it forms that fast 
and moves that quickly theres nothing you can do 
at 345 pm the first call came in to the weather service 
reporting a tornado touchdown at plainfield said forecaster 
richard kenneman the weather service moved a bulletin at 351 
pm but by that time the twisters had already smashed through the 
town and into joliet about 15 miles away 
janet fazio said the few teachers and administrators at 
plainfield high school at the end of the day didnt know the storm 
was coming until a school worker eyed it while closing a window 
that had blown open 
the emergency radio didnt even go off in the main office 
said mrs fazio a secretary 
the tornadoes virtually destroyed the school which had been 
scheduled to open for classes wednesday most teachers and 
administrators had left for the day when the storm struck and some 
took shelter in the school vault 
in a joliet subdivision 35 miles southwest of chicago rich 
alberti got the warning from his wife michelle moments before 
their house was destroyed 
i was sleeping and she was getting ready to take a shower 
alberti said she told me to look out as soon as i saw it i 
knew it was a tornado there werent seconds to spare 
kenneman said tornadoes themselves are too small to be detected 
by available radar but thunderstorms sometimes contain radar 
patterns that indicate a tornado may be developing the 
thunderstorm tuesday did not contain the telltale indications that 
twisters were lurking inside kenneman said 
more sophisticated radar is being developed but he said even 
fair warning cant always protect against natures most devastating 
force 
even assuming the whole warning process plays through 
successfully and people hear the warning there are some tornadoes 
that are violent enough that they are flat out not survivable 
kenneman said 
we have to live with the fact that unless we want to live in 
concrete reinforced bunkers and drive 80000pound steel cars that 
we are going to be vulnerable when weather is severe enough he 
said

police today announced the discovery of an arms 
cache including shoulderheld missiles that reportedly was meant to 
blow up the dome of the rock one of the holiest shrines of islam 
police found the cache belonging to a radical jewish activist 
convicted in a 1984 attempt to attack the golddomed mosque in the 
ultraorthodox neighborhood of mea shearim national police 
spokesman roni yishaya said 
the israeli daily haaretz reported the arms were stolen from the 
army by shimon barda leader of a cavedwelling mystical jewish 
sect for a second attempt on the mosque the daily hadashot said 
several more arrests were expected in the alleged plot 
yishaya refused to comment on the reports he confirmed two law 
missiles were found but would not reveal what else was in the arms 
cache 
the dome of the rock sits atop what is known to jews as the 
temple mount and to moslems as the haram eshsharif or noble 
sanctuary 
the area in jerusalems old city is revered by moslems as the 
site of prophet mohammeds ascent to heaven and by jews as the site 
of solomons temple and the second jewish temple destroyed by the 
romans in 70 ad 
radical jewish groups have called for removal of the dome of the 
rock and adjacent al aqsa mosque for creation of a new jewish 
temple 
barda 31 was sentenced to eight years in jail september 1985 
for the earlier attempt to blow up the dome of the rock he escaped 
in mid1988 and avoided capture until september 1989 by disguising 
himself as a bearded jewish scholar in mea shaarim 
barda led police to the arms cache on wednesday but it was 
unclear why he revealed the hidden weapons now haaretz said he 
stole the weapons during his time out of jail 
in january 1984 barda and two accomplices were caught hauling 28 
pounds of tnt and 15 hand grenades over the walls of the temple 
mount the accomplices were committed to psychiatric care but were 
later released 
the three men had formed a tiny mystical sect that lived in a 
cave in the abandoned palestinian village of lifta on jerusalems 
outskirts 
the temple mount is a frequent source of tension between jews 
and moslems 
it is heavily guarded by police partly because of fears that a 
successful attack on the moslem shrines could endanger the lives of 
jews living in islamic countries

a renegade paramilitary group agreed to disband 
after the armenian parliament outlawed it and declared a state of 
emergency the republics president announced today 
leaders of the armenian national army were to make a television 
appeal for several hundred members to turn in their weapons levon 
terpetrosyan told parliament according to the official tass news 
agency 
acceptance of the appeal would defuse tensions in one of the 
soviet unions most volatile republics where fighting with 
neighboring azerbaijan has claimed hundreds of lives in the last 
two years 
the armenian national army claims to protect armenians from 
armed groups from the neighboring republic of azerbaijan but its 
members have also attacked police stations and gasoline depots in 
armenia to steal weapons and fuel they need to fight azerbaijanis 
the group formed in january is thought to have several hundred 
hardcore fighters and many more sympathizers 
parliament declared the emergency wednesday following shootings 
in the republics capital yerevan members of the armenian 
national army with automatic weapons had attacked the headquarters 
of the armenian national movement a group loyal to the local 
government 
separately a lawmaker and a member of the armenian national 
movement were shot and killed early wednesday as they approached 
the armenian national army headquarters to investigate an earlier 
attack on a gasoline station 
parliament imposed an overnight curfew and gave the armenian 
national army until wednesday night to disband disarm and turn 
over vehicles and buildings it had seized 
when the deadline passed armenian interior ministry troops and 
police in central yerevan surrounded three buildings that are the 
armenian national armys headquarters where about 250 armed 
members had gathered the independent interfax news agency said 
lawmakers negotiated with the armed men who demanded their 
members be allowed to leave with their weapons so they could join 
legal military forces under the governments jurisdiction tass 
said 
their demand was rejected and shortly after midnight about 200 
of the militants surrendered and turned in their weapons tass 
said about 50 managed to flee with their weapons and ammunition 
tass said 
the parliamentary decree granted immunity to those who 
surrendered peacefully and provides severe punishments for those 
who ignored it 
the mainly christian armenia and mainly moslem azerbaijan have 
for two years waged a bloody battle for control over 
nagornokarabakh a largely armenian enclave inside azerbaijan 
the protracted fighting prompted president mikhail s gorbachev 
to issue a decree in july ordering illegally armed groups 
throughout the country to disband and disarm the decree was 
largely ignored and extended into september 
terpetrosyan said the state of emergency and curfew would 
remain in effect until violence ended parliament said the measures 
would be enforced solely by police and troops under their control 
not by soviet forces 
armenias parliament recently voted to become independent from 
the soviet union and to create its own armed forces to safeguard 
the border

pennsylvania says it will enforce a ban 
on virtually all abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy rejecting 
arguments from abortionrights forces that the provision was struck 
down last week 
at issue is pennsylvanias restrictive abortion law which is 
likely to be put to a test in a federal appeals court later this 
year and could ultimately reach the us supreme court 
us district judge daniel j huyett iii threw out key 
provisions of the law on friday including requirements that women 
notify their husbands if they want an abortion and that minors get 
the consent of a parent or a court to have an abortion 
the american civil liberties union and the womens law project 
in philadelphia said wednesday that the ban on abortions after 24 
weeks also was overturned 
but kate l mershimer who argued the case for the state said 
the prohibition remained largely intact the state health 
department has been instructed to enforce the ban 
since only a handful of abortions in pennsylvania each year take 
place after 24 weeks the dispute would appear to carry relatively 
minor significance but the issue could take on greater importance 
if it surfaces in the appeals court 
the 24week ban which prohibits abortions except in cases where 
a woman would face death or irreversible harm was widely viewed as 
a direct assault on roe vs wade the 1973 supreme court ruling 
that established the right to an abortion 
that ruling said a womans decision to have an abortion during 
the first three months of pregnancy must be left to her and her 
doctor it said states may interfere in the abortion decision 
during the second trimester only to protect the womans health and 
may take steps to protect fetal life in the third trimester 
twentyfour weeks falls near the end of the second trimester 
proponents of a ban on abortions after 24 weeks say that a fetus 
has a good chance of surviving at that point in pregnancy 
huyetts ruling which is being appealed by the state stemmed 
from a lawsuit filed by a group of doctors and clinics 
the lawsuit did not challenge the 24week ban but it came into 
play because huyett overturned the laws definition for medical 
emergency which appears in the section 
some provisions that doctors would have to follow in performing 
abortions after 24 weeks such as obtaining the consent of a second 
physician would be suspended in cases of medical emergencies 
according to the law 
aclu spokesman simon heller said the judges action overturns 
the 24week prohibition itself 
but robert gentzel a spokesman for attorney general ernie 
preate jr said the health department was told to enforce the 
24week ban after lawyers concluded it was not voided by huyetts 
ruling

former first lady nancy reagan has 
returned to her home in los angeles and wont need followup 
treatment for the small cancerous tumor she had removed here a 
family spokesman said 
the surgery will not affect the reagans scheduled visit to 
germany poland and the soviet union beginning sept 10 said mark 
weinberg spokesman for mrs reagan and former president reagan 
the basal cell carcinoma was discovered just beneath mrs 
reagans left nostril during a routine dermatological examination 
at the mayo clinic a plastic surgeon removed it wednesday at st 
marys hospital and the reagans returned to california a short time 
later weinberg said 
a basal cell carcinoma is the least dangerous type of skin 
cancer and usually is caused by too much sun said dr peter lynch 
head of the university of minnesotas dermatology department 
though theres little danger of serious illness early diagnosis is 
important because if untreated a carcinoma can destroy the skin 
around it lynch said 
mrs reagan 69 and the former president 79 had been at the 
clinic since monday for routine annual checkups 
weinberg said doctors found the reagans in otherwise excellent 
health he said he didnt know how long mrs reagan had the tumor 
and neither he nor the mayo clinic could give further details of 
the surgery 
in 1987 doctors at bethesda naval hospital removed mrs 
reagans left breast and lymph glands after a cancerous tumor was 
found

iraqi leader saddam hussein said in an interview 
that foreigners held in his country will be the first to go into 
bomb shelters in the event of an attack 
these are guests he said in an interview shown wednesday 
night on cbs we are treating them as guests and according to 
arab tradition guests come before iraqi households 
the 90minute interview taped wednesday in baghdad with cbs 
anchorman dan rather and a separate interview taped tuesday by 
french station tf1 were his first with western reporters since iraq 
invaded kuwait on aug 2 
we do not want war he told rather but he said iraq will 
come out victorious in any conflict god is on our side and 
satan is on the side of the united states saddam said through an 
interpreter 
the iraqi leader declared kuwait is part of iraq and he 
questioned the united states right to demand iraq pull out 
is kuwait the 52nd state of the united states saddam asked 
saddam denied making any secret proposals to pull out of kuwait 
a white house official said wednesday that the bush administration 
received a secret iraqi offer to free all captives and withdraw 
from kuwait if certain conditions were met 
the conditions were that the international trade embargo against 
iraq be lifted and baghdad be granted access to the persian gulf 
and sole control of an oil field that dips into kuwait according 
to the newspaper newsday 
the white house official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the offer was rejected 
saddam stressed that kuwaits status was a separate issue from 
that of saudi arabia where a multinational force has formed to 
head off an invasion by iraq 
he avoided direct answers to many of rathers questions 
including one on whether iraq would use chemical or biological 
weapons if invaded however he said iraq is not going to be an 
easy bite to swallow 
saddam said he was serious about his proposal that he debate 
president bush and british prime mininster margaret thatcher 
washington and london have rejected the idea 
arent the people of the west interested in debate to see the 
facts as they are saddam asked 
he reiterated that the foreigners being held by iraq should not 
be called hostages because iraq was not asking for anything in

a texas drilling company says it cant afford to 
continue paying its six american workers stranded in kuwait and 
iraq 
houston drilling company oge inc said wednesday athat the 
company cant pay the workers families becase the company stopped 
receiving money from kuwait oil co after the invasion of kuwait 
oge provided drilling crews for kuwait oil 
our contracts with these people ended by basis of an act 
of war something beyond our control our contract with them ended 
the day of the invasion aug 2 said oge vice president jay 
simpson 
but family members in texas said the employees were hired and 
paid as oge workers and not as kuwait oil employees one said she 
was angry the company has refused to tell her whether her husbands 
salary would be cut off 
they dont have the guts to tell us said donnita cole of 
odessa whose husband john is an oge employee stranded in 
occupied kuwait they keep putting us off but i feel the 
decision has already been made 
four of the stranded workers are from texas two are from 
florida 
simpson said the company is trying to find some means to help 
the workers whose families were scheduled to receive a monthly 
paycheck on sept 1 he said the company is trying to contact 
kuwait petroleum co the parent company of kuwait oil but has not 
received any indication that money can be sent to the families of 
the stranded workers 
simpson confirmed that oge officials contacted the texas 
employment commission last week to determine whether the stranded 
workers could qualify for unemployment compensation 
simpson conceded the companys position could present a public 
relations problem 
were very very troubled by this obviously he said 
there is nothing that we can do 
simpson refused to say whether oges employees still in the 
united states were continuing to receive paychecks 
if the workers are placed on unemployment compensation the 
maximum payment their families could receive would be 214 per week 
for 26 weeks said bill grossenbacher administrator of the texas 
employment commission in austin 
to be honest we have questions about whether they would even 
qualify grossenbacher said

president najibullah of afghanistan said 
today he was willing to relinquish control of the state media and 
of some troops to an interim commission if new elections are held 
but he rejected the key us demands that the entire armed 
forces and secret police be placed under the authority of a neutral 
council during a transitional period aimed at ending afghanistans 
12yearold civil war 
najibullah who concluded a fourweek trip to the soviet union 
on saturday spoke at a news conference during an official visit to 
india 
we have accepted a transitional period this process begins 
with the opening of talks and dialogue between all afghan political 
forces involved in the conflict he said 
so far the moslem guerrilla leaders based in neighboring 
pakistan have rejected any negotiations with najibullah 
the soviet union which ended its combat support for 
najibullahs government 19 months ago and the united states which 
was one of the chief suppliers of arms to the guerrillas have been 
searching anew for a political solution to the afghan impasse 
washington has dropped its demand that najibullah step down 
before elections are held instead the americans have said he 
could remain president during the elections provided he 
relinquishes control of the army secret police and staterun news 
media to a neutral body 
while the united states and the soviet union seek a compromise 
the rebels continue to insist najibullah must resign before any 
elections are held 
two months ago in a largely cosmetic exercise najibullah 
created a new political party the hezbewatan or national party 
but all the top posts in it went to stalwarts from his old peoples 
democratic party of afghanistan 
asked whether he or his party was willing to step down during a 
transitional period najibullah said we are of the opinion that 
stepping aside cannot solve this problem the same applies to the 
stepping down of this or that personality 
najibullahs lengthy visit to the soviet union had prompted 
speculation that moscow might be trying to ease him out of kabuls 
political picture 
but the 44yearold former secret police chief claimed he had 
simply gone to moscow for some medical checkups my visit to the 
soviet union was not an official visit 
he said all sides in the afghan conflict should open talks 
followed by a ceasefire a peace conference creation of a joint 
commission and finally elections for a new government 
he said this joint commission would then supervise elections 
for a new parliament any party that wins the majority in the 
parliament will form the new government he said

anthem to be played before a concert 
before a concert the croppedhaired 23yearold singer went 
nearly unrecognized wednesday evening at the saratoga performing 
arts center but walked away when some fans and television reporters 
caught on to her 
later during her concert she thanked her fans for their 
support 
i never said i had disrespect for the american people 
oconnor said i have nothing but respect for people of any 
country 
oconnor drew the ire of protesters for her refusal to perform 
at the garden state arts center in new jersey last week unless the 
arena dispensed with its usual practice of playing the 
starspangled banner before concerts arena officials relented 
but later banned oconnor from appearing there again 
several radio stations in new york and new jersey have banned 
her songs they were joined wednesday by kggifm in san bernardino 
calif 
about 10 demonstrators sang the national anthem outside the 
saratoga performing arts center gates wednesday evening and urged

the government announced today 
that it will stop paying for electricity and other essential 
services in black and mixed race townships hit by rent boycotts 
planning and provincial affairs minister hernus kriel said 
services would be phased out in townships where people failed 
to pay for them because of rent boycotts protesting conditions in 
the segregated settlements 
we do not intend to cut off electricity in sensitive areas 
where essential services will be affected like hospitals he 
told reporters 
we also do not want to jeopardize the health of the community 
by cutting off the water totally but we will reduce the flow of 
water or install services where members of the community can only 
use water at certain times of day 
the announcement came as police confronted protesting residents 
of the mixedrace ennerdale township firing tear gas to disperse 
the crowd later more than 500 people marched through the township 
to protest what they claimed were incorrect utility bills 
also today the independent south african press association 
reported that negotiators were finishing a draft agreement to end a 
5yearold rent boycott in soweto the black township of 2 million 
people near johannesburg 
since the boycotts started some five years ago as a protest 
against high rents and poor conditions local township governments 
have been unable to pay electricity water and sewage bills to 
power companies and others 
the government has helped make up the difference but kriel said 
today that it would stop that practice 
suppliers of such services will have no choice but to 
discontinue their services to certain communities especially those 
with a poor record of payment kriel told a news conference in 
pretoria 
the government simply does not have the funds to continue to 
provide bridging finance and the onus to pay for these services 
rests with the consumers themselves he said 
on tuesday electricity water and sewage services were cut in 
the silobela township in the orange free state in central south 
africa township residents complained they never had taken part in 
a rent boycott 
security forces patrolled the township wednesday and today 
perishable food was rotting and residents collected water from a 
nearby stream 
the conflicts have so far involved the black and mixedrace 
townships against white local authorities 
kriel said rent boycotts had increased in recent months despite 
warnings from the government 
he accused some township residents of being intimidated by 
militants into joining the boycott but kriel said the governments 
position was that township residents had the ultimate 
responsibility for paying their bills 
he said electricity would be cut off first then garbage 
collection

diplomats in the iraqi capital today were 
pessimistic that the promised release of foreign women and children 
would get under way before the weekend 
no one expects any development before saturday said one 
senior diplomat involved with negotiations with the iraqi 
authorities iraqi president saddam hussein had said that women and 
children among the foreigners held in iraq would be allowed to 
leave starting wednesday 
diplomats said today that iraq had demanded that foreign planes 
wishing to fly to baghdad to airlift stranded western women and 
children would be allowed to land only if they carry food and 
medicines 
but iraqs ambassador to the united states denied baghdad had 
made such a demand it is absolutely not true the ambssador 
mohamed almashat told reporters after visiting the state 
department 
the official iraqi news agency monitored in nicosia cyprus 
said today a total of 237 foreign women and children guests had 
requested by today to leave the country and 28 had said they 
wished to remain it did not elaborate 
in another development the british broadcdling paperwork to send women 
and children home 
the situation in kuwait is rather complicated by the fact that 
it is impossible for people to come to us and hand in their 
passports said the spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity 
if an airlift of the trapped foreign women and children is not 
allowed the western evacuees will travel in convoys overland most 
likely to the turkish border 370 miles north of baghdad the 
diplomats said insisting on anonymity 
they said in telephone interviews that by midday in baghdad no 
exit visa had been issued for any westerner pending a response 
from foreign governments to the demand for food and medicines 
the senior diplomat said embassies in baghdad were asked to 
compile detailed lists of the women and children who will be 
leaving and that will take all day 
tomorrow no government department will be open he said 
noting that it was friday the moslem sabbath 
he and two others interviewed said they did not believe western 
governments would agree to iraqs request for food and medicines 
which would go against the embargo imposed after the aug 2 
invasion of kuwait 
iraq closed its airspace to all foreign airlines after the 
invasion and subsequent annexation of kuwait its national carrier 
iraqi airways is flying only to amman jordan 
kuwaits airport also has been closed since the invasion 
hundreds of thousands of arabs have crossed into jordan through 
the border post at ruweishid after fleeing kuwait and iraq 
but more than 20000 westerners and japanese stranded in kuwait 
and iraq have not been allowed to leave as iraqis insisted their 
presence would prevent a potential attack by usled western 
forces assembled in saudi arabia 
saddam said tuesday he would allow the women and children to 
leave to preserve the arabs humanitarian image 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said wednesday 
that about onethird of the 3000 americans who have been barred 
from leaving iraq and kuwait are women or children age 18 and under 
she also said that if implemented saddams policy shift was a 
significant step in the right direction she refused however 
to say whether the new policy improves the climate for a negotiated 
settlement

rusty nalley who started the local newspaper the citizen four 
years ago says she consulted with oldtimers and went back through 
the books before settling on the spelling la pine 
residents such as helma holverstott who have studied the issue 
have traced la pine to a developers document from about 1910 
i dont know where that one word with the capital p in the 
middle came from holverstott said 
thats a real bone of contention said nalley even the 
residents of la pine all spell it differently and unless the town 
is incorporated i really dont see anything but a big dispute over 
it nalley said 
postal authorities added to the confusion by establishing a 
postmark spelled lapine but they switched to la pine in 1951

brian keenan who spent 4 years as a 
hostage in lebanon today called for negotiations to release others 
from a capitivity he recalled as a silent screaming slide into 
the bowels of ultimate despair 
its time to talk its obviously time to talk there is a 
willingness why not talk keenan told a news conference 
keenan a native of belfast northern ireland was released by 
his captors last week and handed over to irish authorities in 
damascus syria on saturday he was released from the private 
mater hospital in dublin this morning 
speaking slowly sometimes pausing to avoid crying keenan 
talked at length about life in captivity 
hostage is crucifying aloneness theres a silent screaming 
slide into the bowels of ultimate despair he said reading from 
a handwritten statement 
hostage is a man hanging by his fingernails over the edge of 
chaos and feeling his fingers slowly straightening 
hostage is the humiliating stripping away of every sense and 
fiber of body and mind and spirit that make you what you are 
hostage is a mutant creation full of selfloathing guilt and 
deathwishing but hes a man a rare unique and beautiful creation 
of which these things are no part 
tiny tiny cells constant blindfolds prolonged days in the 
dark sometimes weeks without light create kinds of insanity that 
drive men deep deep into themselves keenan said 
keenan who was teaching english in beirut when he was kidnapped 
on april 11 1986 spoke with particular affection of british 
journalist john mccarthy with whom he had been held 
other people one begins to look at with strange mistrustful 
apprehension but the irrepressible wit that is the golden kernel 
of john coped ultimately and always emerged he said 
jill morrell mccarthys friend who was seated behind keenan 
broke into a bright smile as keenan talked about his fellow captive 
keenan described american hostage terry anderson the chief 
middle east correspondent of the associated press as a bulky and 
belligerent newspaperman with a voracious appetite for 
intellectual conversations 
thomas sutherland a scottishborn american who was acting dean 
of agriculture at the american university of beirut gave the other 
hostages long lectures on genetics animal husbandry and his 
beloved 27yearold volvo car keenan said 
thirteen westerners including six americans are still held in 
lebanon by extremists groups believed to have ties with iran 
anderson the longestheld western hostage was kidnapped in 
beirut on march 16 1985 
mccarthy was kidnapped april 17 1986 and sutherland on june 9 
1985 
keenan said anderson suffered from a digestive ailment and was 
frequently in pain but he took it stoically for in truth all 
pain and illness was generally dismissed by our keepers though 
they would eventually supply us with some form of antibiotics 
keenan said anderson sometimes kept him awake for hours of 
conversation 
i think he debated with himself a lot while we tried to plug 
our ears keenan joked terry would also have his periods of 
despair and seek solace in his family terry and myself would sit 
through those long nights and speak with great pain and remorse and 
longing for his daughter gabrielle 
with many tears he would elaborate his plans when he was 
finally back in the states to help her to shape and discover her 
future 
in those confessional moments which were common to us all a 
deep and enduring and unbreakable bond was formed 
he said anderson talked of starting a project for delinquent 
boys in the united states 
keenan said he last saw anderson 11 months ago and that they 
spent eight months together 
the doyen of hostages as he has been called is a man who 
felt so committed to these things that he inspired us to our own 
survival projects keenan said of anderson 
to a reporter who asked how he felt about the prospect of 
returning home to belfast keenan said ive been locked up in a 
hole in the ground for four years how would you feel 
keenan appealed to journalists to be careful about their 
reporting 
all of us are but teeth on a comb and if one of us is snapped 
off in a sudden rage it cannot cannot be put back 
keenan said he did not see british hostage terry waite though 
he was aware at one time of the presence of another prisoner he 
could not identify 
i felt in the last place we were in there was certainly 
another hostage whom i heard in the early hours of the morning 
saying oh no oh no that could be french that could be 
anything he said

us coast guardsmen trained for 
caribbean drug interdiction have been added to navy boarding 
teams enforcing the economic embargo of iraq us military 
sources said thursday 
the coast guardsmen arrived in the persian gulf region this week 
and are aboard several of the 27 us ships patrolling the gulf 
the arabian sea and the red sea the sources said they spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the combined teams of five to 10 navy and coast guard members 
carry sidearms and m16 assault rifles when they board ships 
usually from small boats 
the teams question ships officers and ask to inspect the cargo 
if one is found to have iraqi connections the ship may be 
diverted to another port said the sources 
they said us warships have intercepted about 170 ships and 
boarded at least 10 in the gulf and red sea since president bush 
issued his aug 16 order aimed at strangling iraqs economy and 
warmaking potential 
while most were allowed to continue the sources said navy 
boarders found at least two with iraqirelated cargo and induced 
them to alter their sailing plans usually this means they are 
asked to return to their port of origin said a gulfbased source 
one ship a chinese freighter went to a southern gulf port 
after a team from the cruiser uss england found it was carrying 
iraqi fertilizer the sources said they could not provide details 
on the other ship 
challenging a ships identity and destination is a routine 
naval practice in peacetime 
most interceptions occur in the persian gulf and its gateway 
the strait of hormuz others have taken place in the approaches to 
jordans red sea port of aqaba a key port used to import goods 
destined for iraq 
according to lloyds shipping intelligence service in london a 
number of ships have been turned away there and at least one was 
boarded in recent days but allowed to proceed 
the us sources said there have been no incidents of resistance 
or shooting since aug18 when two american missile frigates fired 
warning shots in an attempt to stop a pair of iraqi tankers exiting 
the gulf 
still under surveillance the tankers reached the yemeni port of 
aden on the south arabian peninsula where they remain anchored 
the sources said 
yemen has denied the ships unloaded at aden 
the sources said no other iraqi oil carriers have been sighted 
moving to or from kuwait or southern iraq since the firing 
incidents 
since that incident it was reported that iraqi officials had 
instructed ship captains not to resist challenges by us and other 
warships a move that analysts saw as possibly eliminating one key 
potential trigger for war 
the coast guard was brought into the gulf operation because it 
has men specially trained to board and inspect ships at sea said 
lt cmdr paul milligan a coast guard spokesman in new york 
he said the teams sent to the gulf were veterans of the 
7yearold us drug interdiction program in the caribbean where 
they also operate from navy ships 
neither milligan nor military sources in the region could say 
how many coast guardsmen were assigned to the gulf 
british defense sources were unable to say how many 
interceptions or boardings had been carried out by the three royal 
navy warships in the gulf or whether they had found any with iraqi 
cargo 
in another development military sources said two australian 
missile frigates have arrived in the gulf bringing the total 
number of warships directly involved in the multinational blockade 
force to at least 32 three italian six french warships are also 
en route

jordans ambassador to the united states said 
thursday that the us military presence in the middle east will 
radicalize the region and endanger the existing arab political 
order 
do not delude yourselves that most arabs welcome the presence 
of american troops in the area ambassador hussein hammami said 
at the national press club 
hammami also said a settlement to the crisis caused by iraqs 
invasion of kuwait must be linked to the palestinian problem and 
the arab conflict with israel 
jordan he said needs about 2 billion a year in aid over the 
next five years to compensate for economic losses sustained by 
supporting sanctions against iraq he welcomed a reported plan 
under which president bush would ask us allies to assist 
countries affected by the trade embargo against iraq 
jordans king hussein while condemning iraqs aug 2 takeover 
of kuwait has differed sharply with washington over the 
introduction of american troops in the region and sought to keep 
the door open for mediation with iraq 
hammami said jordan was not siding with iraq and that king 
hussein was a voice of sanity in a climate of frenzy 
us troops in the area hammami said can only fuel radical 
sentiments in the arab world endanger the existing arab political 
order and hit hard at american and western interests in the middle 
east 
he said the radical right in jordan has for the first time 
joined he radical left including communists to oppose the us 
presence 
the jordanian envoy said iraqs withdrawal from kuwait would 
only bring temporary respite to the mideast crisis 
one cannot divorce the kuwaiti problem from the palestinian 
problem or the variety of other problems that have plagued arab 
societies hammami said 
he said the united states in opposing iraqs occupation of 
kuwait should also move to end israels occupation of territory in 
the west bank and gaza strip 
we would like to see the standards applied to kuwait also 
applied to palestinians he said 
iraqs president saddam hussein has suggested that a withdrawal 
of iraqi troops from kuwait was possible if israel pulled out of 
occupied territory 
hammami said jordan supported un resolutions on economic 
sanctions against iraq but asked are we required to commit 
national suicide 
he said jordans losses from the sanctions would include 200 
million annually in exports to iraq 250 million in transit 
business 180 million in higher oil prices 310 million in debt 
repayment from iraq 135 million in grants pledged by kuwait and 
320 million in remittances from jordanians working in kuwait 
most of the 100000 jordanians in kuwait will return home 
boosting unemployment in jordan from 15 percent to a possible 35 
percent he said 
hammami said the 2 billion in grants and cheap loans needed 
over the next five years amount to about 50 percent of jordans 
gross domestic product 
he said no ship with goods bound for iraq had entered the 
jordanian port of aqaba since aug 19 but that jordan would 
continue to allow food and other basic commodities into iraq unless 
it receives other guidelines from the un 
the iraqis as a people should not be punished he said 
hammami denied reports that jordan was training the iraqi 
military in the use of us hawk missiles seized in kuwait 
we have not in any way helped the iraqis in this crisis he 
said

diplomats in baghdad said iraq will allow planes to pick up 
trapped western women and children only if the aircraft fly food 
and medicine into iraq but iraqs ambassador to the united states 
today denied that 
the iraqi envoy mohamed almashat said baghdad had attached no 
such conditions to the release of the foreigners 
it is absolutely not true he told reporters after a visit 
to the state department i categorically deny that 
if flights could not be arranged the western evacuees would 
have to travel overland most likely to turkey 370 miles north of 
the capital said the diplomats in baghdad who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
iraqs airspace is closed to all foreign carriers 
red tape will prevent any release before saturday a senior 
diplomat said 
iraq promised tuesday that the thousands of western women and 
children would be able to begin leaving the next day but president 
saddam hussein has yet to fulfill the promise 
of the 21000 western hostages in iraq and kuwait 3000 are 
americans including about 1000 women and children 
the british broadcasting corp said a group of captive 
foreigners was paraded before the international press in baghdad 
today 
it was for some of them a rather distressing experience 
children cried a great deal and some of the women cried 
correspondent john simpson reported the nationalities of the 
foreigners involved was not known 
on wednesday saddam denied seeking a deal for an iraqi 
withdrawal from kuwait despite mounting international military and 
economic pressure iraqi seized the oilrich emirate on aug 2 and 
later annexed it 
in other developments 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar heading for 
talks in jordan with iraqs foreign minister said today he seeks 
to apply security council resolutions not to negotiate what has 
been decided the main resolution calls for iraqs withdrawal from 
kuwait 
it is not my job and i want to be very clear about it to 
negotiate the resolutions he said during a stopover in paris 
perez de cuellar said he will meet with tariq aziz on friday 
morning according to un officials in new york 
president bush will dispatch highlevel aides to solicit funds 
from several wealthy countries to defray 1 billion in monthly 
costs for the us military buildup in the persian gulf officials 
said today in washington 
the arab league was meeting in cairo today to hear a report on 
whether any progress had been made in implementing its resolutions 
on the invasion which call for an iraqi withdrawal only 13 of the 
21 league members showed up reflecting the divisions the invasion 
has caused in the arab world 
turkey said today that it had rejected an iraqi request to 
resume food shipments for needy iraqi children saying it will 
adhere to the unordered embargo on trade with baghdad 
a us diplomatic source confirmed reports that resistance 
fighters in kuwait are receiving american logistical support 
in new york 36 expelled iraqi diplomats and their families 
left early today on a plane for jordan washington ordered them out 
in reaction to a series of iraqi moves against the us embassy in 
kuwait and its staff 
two westerners made it to safety in jordan today one an 
american of indian origin and a 17yearold british girl of arab 
extraction they were among 185 evacuees who flew into jordan 
aboard the daily iraqi airways flight 
the american jn sharma 55 an agricultural engineer from 
idaho falls idaho told reporters he had spent three weeks hiding 
in occupied kuwait he said he hid his us passport and left iraq 
using an indian travel document 
the senior foreign diplomat in baghdad who is involved in 
negotiations with iraqi authorities said embassies were asked to 
compile detailed lists of the women and children who will be 
leaving and that will take all day 
diplomats said they were drawing up lists for exit visas 
tomorrow no government department will be open the diplomat 
noted referring to friday the moslem sabbath no one expects 
any development before saturday he and two others said they did 
not believe western governments would agree to iraqs request 
flights containing food and medicine 
iraq has been feeling the effects of the militarily enforced 
un embargo bread lines have been reported in the country and 
saddam has urged iraqi women to cut meat and bread consumption in 
half 
saddam gave his first interviews to western reporters with dan 
rather of cbs and a french network since his forces seized kuwait 
the iraqi leader told rather on wednesday that kuwait is part 
of iraq and denied seeking any deals that could lead to an iraqi 
pullout 
iraq will come out victorious saddam said god is on our 
side and satan is on the side of the united states 
a white house official confirmed wednesday that the bush 
administration had received a secret iraqi offer to free all 
captives and withdraw from kuwait if certain conditions were met 
the conditions were that the unordered embargo on trade with 
iraq be lifted and that baghdad be granted access to the persian 
gulf and sole control of an oil field that dips into kuwait 
according to a report wednesday by the new york newspaper newsday 
the white house official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the offer was rejected 
saddam told a newsman from fraces tf1 on tuesday that he is not 
an easy target because he does not remain in one place to invite 
being bombed 
the state department says iraq has apparently moved 70 americans 
to military and industrial installations to prevent a us attack 
nevertheless state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
said on wednesday that if saddam carries out his promise to free 
the western women and children it will be a significant step in 
the right direction 
saddam previously offered to free the 21000 western hostages if 
washington withdraws its more than 60000member force from the 
region and guarantees the embargo is lifted the united states 
rejected the offer 
perez de cuellar was to discuss the crisis friday with iraqi 
foreign minister tariq aziz in amman the un chief who stopped 
over in paris on wednesday was expected to arrive in the jordanian 
capital this afternoon 
senior arab military officials said wednesday that the talks 
could touch on plans by saddam to give kuwait limited selfrule in 
a bid to ease the crisis the officials who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said saddam was likely to announce the move before the 
end of september 
the un trade embargo aimed at forcing iraq into pulling out 
of kuwait got an important boost from opec and japan on wednesday 
opec oil ministers approved a plan allowing saudi arabia 
venezuela and other members of the cartel to pump more oil and help 
hold down crude prices one opec minister predicted the agreement 
could replace 3 million of the 4 million barrels of oil the day 
that disappeared from the world market because of the embargos on 
iraqi and kuwaiti oil 
that shortfall caused oil prices to skyrocket 
japan said today that it plans to initially spend 1 billion on 
medics transportation and nonlethal aid for the multinational 
force challenging iraq however tokyo ruled out a role for japans 
military 
a us diplomatic source confirmed in general terms news reports 
that the cia and army special forces troops were helping the 
kuwaiti resistance in hitandrun attacks on iraqi occupiers 
two television networks nbc and cnn said no us troops were 
directly involved in fighting but that kuwaiti fighters based on 
the saudikuwait border were getting us intelligence weapons 
radios advice and instruction 
the source speaking on condition of anonymity said were 
aware of their action and were supporting them but claimed to 
be unaware of details

investigators say the serial killer 
stalking gainesville college students is a shrewd methodical 
maniac with a talent for slipping inside windows or doors and a 
sick grudge against slim brunettes 
an army of investigators including an fbi expert who worked on 
the ted bundy charles manson and son of sam cases has 
descended on this terrified college town in the hunt for the killer 
of four young women and a man 
the victims students at either the university of florida or 
santa fe community college were stabbed to death in offcampus 
apartments in three attacks discovered since sunday police said 
three of the women were mutilated 
more that a thousand friends and family members gathered at a 
pompano beach church today to mourn one of the victims 18yearold 
sonja larson 
her boyfriend mic ocasio wept uncontrollably as the rev ken 
smith called the murders tragic painful scary and horrible 
was it just last week we sat and talked about the future 
now its gone all gone 
police chief wayland clifton said wednesday that the killer 
apparently tracked certain types of women and entered their 
apartments through unlocked doors or windows or by forcing 
slidingglass doors 
there is a similarity in physical appearance in the four 
female victims as far as hair color eye color and general physical 
build clifton said 
but he warned that the killer could strike at other types or 
find other ways of gaining entry he can change his method of 
operations as he desires he said weve gotten a rather shrewd 
individual on our hands 
we do feel we we have someone who is methodical about the way 
he handles things clifton said we believe the suspect had 
prior knowledge of the occupants of a dwelling 
police have refused to say whether any of the victims were 
sexually assaulted 
the chief said police believed the killer was still in the area 
and that there was enough evidence to track him down each 
passing hour we feel much more confident that we will be able to 
bring this case to a successful closure he said 
the bodies of miss larson and her roommate christina powell 
17 were found sunday authorities said the body of christa hoyt 
18 was found monday the bodies of tracey inez paules 23 and 
manuel r taboada 23 were discovered tuesday 
all were students either at the university of florida or santa 
fe community college and all were found in campusarea apartments 
a double killing was reported wednesday at a house in melrose 
about 20 miles northeast of gainesville and authorities sought to 
allay fears that it was related to the deaths here sheriffs 
spokesman spencer mann said it was unlikely its linked to the 
series of homicides police said the victims were in their late 
30s but released no other details 
since the killings hundreds of students have gone home to their 
parents or moved in with friends in hopes of finding safety in 
numbers some armed themselves with guns mace and knives and 
stores reported a run on deadbolt locks and even broomsticks that 
residents were using to secure doors and windows 
mail carriers pizza deliverers and other service workers were 
told to be careful not to alarm jumpy residents police warned 
people not to open their doors without asking for identification 
the university did not cancel classes but suspended attendance 
regulations 
three of the women had multiple stab wounds the breasts of two 
of them had been cut with a surgically sharp instrument said 
investigators speaking on condition of anonymity the third woman 
was decapitated 
the orlando sentinel reported her head was found on a shelf in 
her apartment but sheriff lu hindery would not comment on that 
the newspaper also said the hands legs or mouth of several of the 
women were bound with tape 
about 600 local police state law officers and fbi agents were 
investigating and providing security at apartment complexes 
an fbi team and state experts worked on a psychological profile 
of the killer among the fbi experts was john douglas who was 
involved in the serial homicide cases of bundy who died in 
floridas electric chair last year manson and david berkowitz 
the 1970s son of sam killer in new york city 
criminologist alexander bassin of florida state university 
where bundy killed two women in a sorority house rampage said 
there was an absolutely chilling resemblance between the 
gainesville slayings and the bundy murders of 1978 
university of florida criminologist ronald akers said the killer 
is most likely white older than his victims and probably has a 
background of violence

its simply a business decision based on lyrics that glamorized 
violence racism and misogyny 
not so says the band accusing the record company of a double 
standard when it comes to standards some in the industry suggest 
the double standard is based on skin color not song content and 
womens rights groups remain appalled by the groups insensitive 
rhymes 
imagine a mix of nwas violent imagery and 2 live crews 
sexual nasties the la times steve hochman wrote of the geto 
boys rappers nwa had their own lyric problems last year when 
police officers nationwide were riled by a song urging violence 
against law enforcement 
the geto boys are just as graphic about violence a sample 
lyric her bodys beautiful so im thinking rape shouldnt have 
had her curtains open so thats her fate 
as a business decision its probably crazy this record with 
the publicity is no doubt going to sell a lot of copies were 
talking tonnage bryn bridenthal geffen vice president of media 
and artist relations said about the lp the geto boys 
i was flabbergasted that people would describe violence that 
graphically in music people will think this is like 2 live crew 
which is kind of silly just pure sex she continued i was 
frightened by this 
yet geffen is the label for heavy metal guns n roses which was 
accused of racism and homophobia in its lyrics and it distributes 
the infamous andrew dice clay whose scatological sexist shows 
created a furor earlier this year clay like the geto boys is 
signed to def american 
this is the same label which backed dice and guns n roses 
without any hesitation even when there was a big flap you have to 
wonder if this inconsistency borders on racism veteran rap 
publicist bill adler said last week 
debbie bennett director of public relations for the 2 live 
crews luke records was more direct its easier to single out a 
black group on a small label than any white group right now it 
seems like the racist easy thing to pick on 
the controversy is the latest round in the record 
labelingcensorship battle the 2 live crew remain under fire for 
their as nasty as they wanna be album which was ripped for its 
graphic sexual content and its denigration of women 
in louisiana a bill requiring labeling for recordings with 
potentially offensive lyrics passed the legislature but was vetoed 
artists are striking back bruce springsteen allowed 2 live crew 
to sample his born in the usa for the groups rap response 
to its critics banned in the usa neil young included a song 
with an obscenity on his upcoming lp to insure it gets a parental 
advisory sticker 
as for the geto boys themselves lead rapper bushwick bill has 
defended his lyrics as reallife reports from houstons destitute 
fifth ward publicist heidi robinson says to focus on the salacious 
side of the group is to miss the point 
this band is very very threedimensional there are reasons 
for the songs theyve written said robinson to dismiss them 
as four guys doing this for shock value is to take them simply at 
face value 
theres little doubt about the offensive content of the black 
groups lyrics mind of a lunatic details the rape and murder 
of a woman trigga happy nigga is about a liquor store heist 
and the slaying of a stool pigeon gangster of love includes a 
litany of graphic sex 
this art perpetuates and makes acceptable certain violence 
against women we think that is abhorrent said francoise 
jacobsohn president of the new york chapter of the national 
organization for women 
jacobsohn hailed geffens decision but questioned why the geto 
boys were singled out were pleased that misogyny and violence 
are out but we think the same set of rules should apply to andrew 
dice clay 
publicist robinson mentions the positive things the band is 
about life in the fast lane is an antidrug song the group 
wants to funnel some of its profits back into the fifth ward for a 
boys club they encourage black youth to get an education 
to focus on violence and sexism is to be flat 
onedimensional she said they have an awful lot of good 
things too

women and handicapped people are having a 
tougher time than healthy men finding work in east germanys 
rapidly shrinking job market activists said thursday 
the government confirmed that disabled workers were being 
unfairly targeted for layoffs by factories forced to slash payrolls 
to compete in the new capitalist economy 
officials also conceded that companies still in a position to 
hire people are reluctant to employ women because of special 
benefits women were given by the former communist government 
christina schenk an official with the independent womens 
association a rights group said layoffs of east german workers 
are being distributed almost evenly among men and women 
however women are having a harder time qualifying for jobless 
benefits 
slightly more than half of the unemployed men are able to 
qualify for the minimum jobless benefit 325 per month compared 
to 27 percent of the women she said 
according to ms schenk men also are three times more likely to 
be hired for the increasingly dwindling job openings in the country 
gabriela reinhardt spokeswoman for the governments central 
labor agency said ms schenks figures were correct she said 
fewer women qualify for unemployment because many held parttime 
jobs 
those women still can qualify for social assistance of 263 per 
month she said 
she conceded that many companies are reluctant to hire women 
because east german law currently grants women one paid day off per 
month to give them time for housework she said women also have a 
higher absentee rate because of illnesses among their children 
experts say more than 90 percent of east german women held jobs 
under the former communist regime a sharp contrast to west 
germany where most women stay at home 
womens groups have charged that because of the situation in 
west germany east german women will be forced out of the labor 
market when the two german states unite oct 3 
ilja seifert head of the east german disabled persons 
association said handicapped people are among those being targeted 
for layoffs first by companies 
ms reinhardt also said disabled people were losing their jobs 
at a disproportionate rate 
unfortunately many firms work outside the law she said 
it is not lawful to fire someone for the sole reason they are 
disabled but unfortunately it happens often 
seifert and ms schenk both spoke at a news conference called by 
activist groups that have formed since east germany began 
experiencing serious economic problems 
many east german enterprises typically overstaffed and often 
inefficient and outmoded have been pushed to the brink of collapse 
since east germany moved to a free market july 1 
some experts said east german joblessness could reach 4 million 
klaus grehn head of a workers rights group called the 
unemployment association said the total number of unemployed in 
east germany is about 15 million or 18 percent of the workforce 
east germany pegged its number of jobless at about 350000 as of 
last friday about 4 percent 
joachim hildebradt spokesman for the government labor 
committee said grehns group counts east germans who do not fall 
under the governments definition of unemployed and said the 
figures were too high

federal health investigators said thursday 
theyve isolated a chemical compound contaminating certain batches 
of ltryptophan the nutritional supplement that sickened perhaps 
5000 americans and killed 27 
investigators still dont know how the contaminant got in the 
product and scientists have yet to determine whether the compound 
is itself the cause of the illness or just a marker of another 
substance 
but data indicate that implicated ltryptophancontaining 
products were contaminated with the compound the cdc said the 
compound called chromatography was discovered during tests to 
break down and analyze the defective product batches the cdc 
reported 
nationwide cdc has received reports of 1536 cases of a rare 
blood disorder called eosinophiliamyalgia syndrome or ems which 
has been linked to consumption of ltryptophan an amino acid 
twentyseven patients have died 
the actual case count may be substantially higher the cdc said 
noting the presence of a number of cases that dont meet the 
agencys initial case definition but still appear to be 
ltryptophanrelated ems 
maybe our figures might be missing half the cases id say 
3000 to 5000 is a reasonably good estimate said dr edwin 
kilbourne chief of health studies at the cdcs center for 
environmental health 
the food and drug administration ordered all ltryptophan 
products off the market after the outbreak began last fall it was 
sold through health food stores as a remedy for conditions 
including weight problems sleeplessness and depression 
a new england journal of medicine report this month concluded 
that the japanese chemical company whose ltryptophan product has 
been linked to most cases had made two changes in manufacturing 
that could have caused the problem the introduction of a new 
strain of genetically altered bacteria and a change in its 
filtering process 
that report spurred biotechnology watchdog jeremy rifkin a 
critic of genetic engineering to pronounce the deaths to be the 
first ever caused by genesplicing 
theres no way to answer whether genesplicing could be to 
blame for the compound contaminating the ltryptophan said dr 
larry needham toxicology chief for the cdcs center for 
environmental health we dont know how its produced yet 
the compound is known as a ditryptophan aminal of acetaldehyde 
needham said it was identified in trace amounts in 
chromatography tests of 50 lots of ltryptophan produced by the 
implicated manufacturer which has been identified in other reports 
as japans showa denko kk 
its an impurity needham said its not supposed to be in 
the product 
lab investigations found no signs of bacteria or viruses 
contaminating the product 
federal researchers will now attempt to produce the chemical 
compound and test it in laboratory rats to see if they show ems 
symptoms needham said 
symptoms of ems include pains fever rash and shortness of 
breath

dianne feinstein and pete wilson are 
virtually tied in the governors race according to a poll that 
shows many voters swayed by gender bias and dislike for one 
candidate 
twentytwo percent of those polled said theyd vote for democrat 
feinstein because they dont like wilson but most 32 percent 
said theyd vote for feinstein because she did a good job as san 
francisco mayor 
meanwhile 35 percent of wilsons supporters polled said theyd 
vote for the us senator because they dont like feinstein that 
was the no 1 reason given for favoring wilson over feinstein 
overall the statewide california poll of 894 voters showed 
wilson with a slight edge over feinstein 45 percent to 42 percent 
according to results released wednesday the telephone poll was 
conducted aug 1727 and has a margin of error of 45 percentage 
points 
poll director mervin field said the nearly even split is the 
result of pronounced but offsetting gender biases women voters 
preferred feinstein 47 percent to 41 percent and men voters favored 
her republican opponent 49 percent to 37 percent

opiumproducing poppies have popped up in 
dozens of yards at public housing complexes and authorities are 
warning residents to remove the plants or face eviction and arrest 
all of the apartments where the flowers had been growing were 
rented by tenants of southeast asian descent who may not have 
realized that raising the plants is a crime said edie 
piercethomas who oversees the management of the public housing 
projects 
we are talking about many many families she said the 
situation had become rather extensive 
public housing complexes were saturated last week with fliers 
ordering tenants to remove the plants most have been pulled up 
authorities said 
st paul public housing agency officials said they did not 
become aware of the problem until about six weeks ago when 
interpreters employed by the agency reported seeing opium poppies 
blooming 
police said while they are concerned about the number of tenants 
apparently growing the plants they doubt it was part of a 
largescale opium operation 
i dont think there were enough flowers to support something 
like that said lt jim singer head of the narcotics unit 
but singer said investigators did find a number of plants had 
been prepared in such a way as to produce opium 
there are more than 90 species of poppies but only the opium 
poppy p somniferum produces opium the powerful narcotic that is 
the source of heroin codeine and morphine 
before the flowers can produce opium cuts must be made on the 
surface of the unripe seedpods a milky resin flows from the 
lacerations and turns into a brown gummy material that is then 
dried and pulverized to make powdered opium 
some southeast asian community leaders said wednesday they heard 
of attempts to raise opium poppies but they doubt the practice is 
widespread 
but what they got wasnt good for anything it wasnt really 
opium not strong like the opium in laos said yao lo a staff 
member at lao family community inc 
lo said the drug is used in some traditional medicines by some 
southeast asians

president bush said today that the shape of 
the postcold war world is at stake in the middle east and 
announced that he would ask other nations to help pay the 
multibilliondollar expenses of the gulf crisis 
were more than willing to bear our fair share of the burden 
but we also expect others to bear their fair share he said 
in an afternoon news conference he mentioned west germany japan 
kuwait saudi arabia the united arab emirates and south korea 
among the nations that would be solicited for contributions 
bush said he had approved a plan to seek funds from those 
countries to help defray military costs and give assistance to 
middle east nations suffering the most economic hardship from the 
persian gulf crisis administration officials said jordan turkey 
and egypt would be the majpr recipients 
the cost of the us buildup in saudi arabia and in the gulf 
waters is now running at about 1 billion a month us officials 
have said bush said his secretary of state and secretary of the 
treasury would travel abroad to seek contributions to the effort 
reiterating his goals including the withdrawal of iraqi troops 
from kuwait and the restoration of the kuwaiti government and the 
security of saudi arabia he said that at stake is the shape of 
the postcold war world 
anyone with a stake in international order has an interest in 
assuring that all of us succeed he said 
bush told reporters he was very concerned about the fate of the 
3000 americans who have been barred from leaving iraq and kuwait 
and added but we cannot permit hostage taking to shape the 
foreign policy of this country the state department was 
expressing anger that bureaucratic steps had been imposed by iraq 
on its offer to release women and children 
bush was asked about the comments of sen richard lugar rind 
who has said he believes the united states should seek the 
overthrow of iraqs saddam hussein lugar has said that even if 
kuwaiti rulers are returned to power saddam could pose a future 
threat because of his large army his willingness to use chemical 
weapons and his efforts to develop the capability to deliver a 
nuclear bomb 
it seems to me important that saddam hussein must either leave 
or be removed lugar said on wednesday 
bush said he had great respect for lugar and that lugar had 
been one among a dozen of members of congress with whom he had 
dined wednesday night but he did not endorse the view that saddam 
had to be deposed now no matter what happens with kuwait 
he welcomed efforts to find a negotiated settlement but despite 
the arrival of the un secretary general in amman jordan he 
said i am not too optimistic 
asked if he agreed with some congressmen who said the chances of 
fighting were diminishing the longer the crisis lasted bush said 
it was difficult to predict what saddam might do 
its so hard to answer that question because of the 
unpredictable nature of saddam hussein himself the president 
said its very hard to measure intentions i dont know what 
is in this mans mind 
bush said he had raised the very same question himself earlier 
today in a meeting with analysts and specialists on the arab 
world 
bush said saddams meetings with western guests televised 
worldwide did not seem to have helped him change world opinion 
i dont think it is cutting in to the desire to see the united 
nations sanctions be fulfilled he said adding that he 
considered saddams use of the western hostages that way 
brutal manipulative and cynical 
he defended his decision to return to his kennebunkport vacation 
home saying he was not bothered by criticism of it he said 
hed managed to handle the crisis workload while still getting some 
time for relaxation 
secretary of state james baker iii and treasury secretary 
nicholas brady were being set to the persian gulf europe and asia 
in an effort to explain the international assistance plan drafted 
this week in washington 
i think theyll be very responsive he said when asked about 
west germany 
japan today announced a 1 billion commitment and bush noted 
that it didnt take an american envoy for japanese officials to 
make the offer 
the administration wants to raise about 12 billion in the first 
year to cover the estimated 1 billion per month in additional 
military costs the united states is spending to keep its forces in 
saudi arabia and the persian gulf region the official said 
clearly it will have some budget implications bush said 
adding i dont feel the answer is a war tax at home bush said 
on top of that economic aid will be solicited for countries 
hard hit by the international embargo on trading with iraq and 
which are suffering additional hardship from thousands of refugees 
fleeing from iraq and kuwait 
theres nothing thats painless bush said in defending the 
economic embargo that is designed to deter president saddam hussein 
but also has hurt the ordinary people of iraq 
japan came up with the extra 1 billion after bush called prime 
minister toshiki kaifu on wednesday and us officials indicated 
they expected more than the package japan had announced earlier in 
the day the official said 
kaifu unveiled wednesday a package of money medics and 
transportation for the multinational effort against iraq but the 
only figure he mentioned was 10 million in economic assistance for 
refugees in jordan he also said turkey egypt and jordan would get 
substantial economic aid 
today a government spokesman said tokyo would contribute at 
least 1 billion on the aid package apart from that bilateral 
economic aid 
bushs arm twisting comes as congress members while voicing 
overwhelming support for bushs persian gulf strategy to date also 
have begun to question why the united states is bearing so much of 
the financial and military burden 
some have said the other wealthy nations especially japan and 
west germany should share in the costs 
since interrupting his maine vacation for a threeday washington 
trip bush has met with cabinet officers treasury officials and 
other top aides to work on the plan 
the national security council on wednesday signed off on the 
financial plan to solicit for money the funds would be in addition 
to the military cooperation that so far has seen 22 countries 
participating in one way or another with the military aspects of 
blockade enforcement and troop deployment aimed at thwarting saddam

a 52 million libel damage award to singer 
wayne newton from nbc was overturned thursday by a federal appeals 
court it said a broadcast suggesting mob ties in newtons purchase 
of a casino was not shown to be deliberately or recklessly false 
a jury in las vegas found that the television networks october 
1980 story about a federal investigation of the singers recent 
acquisition of the aladdin hotel and casino had created a false 
impression that criminal organizations had helped in the purchase 
in exchange for a hidden share and that newton had deceived nevada 
gaming officials 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals in a 30 ruling said 
most of the factual statements in the broadcast were undisputed 
and that any false impressions had not been shown to be deliberate 
or reckless 
for example the court said citing evidence in the case newton 
had contacted a purported organized crime figure guido penosi 
about a problem penosi had arranged a solution and penosi and an 
associate later discussed the possibility of profiting from 
newtons ownership of the aladdin a subject that came under 
federal investigation 
newton testified that he asked penosi to stop organized crime 
threats against himself and his daughter that subject was not 
mentioned in the nbc story the court said newton had testified 
falsely to the state gaming board about his relationship with 
penosi 
the court did not say whether the story as a whole was false 
an issue it did not have to reach instead it found a lack of 
evidence that the journalists had either deliberately lied or had 
been reckless with the truth that standard must be met by public 
figures or public officials suing the news media for libel 
the court said us district judge myron crocker who reduced 
the jurys 193 million libel award to 52 million erroneously 
allowed the damages to be based on a conclusion that nbc should 
have realized its broadcast would give a false impression 
what journalists should have realized or foreseen is irrelevant 
in a libel suit by a public figure which must be based on what a 
journalist actually knew and intended said the appellate decision 
by judge william norris 
he said crocker also improperly substituted his own view as 
to the supposed impression left by the broadcast for that of the 
journalists who prepared the broadcast 
newton had argued that the storys failure to mention the 
threats against him as the reason he had contacted penosi was a 
deliberate omission of the truth but norris said the reporters had 
reasons to doubt that threats had been made noting that they had 
gotten a denial from newtons lawyer 
norris said the broadcasts statement that newton had financial 
problems at the time of the purchase was true the broadcast had 
some ambiguities about his financial arrangements and testimony 
which might have been cleared up by different wording but 
editorial decisions about broadcasts are best left to editors 
not to judges and juries norris said

here is a text of president bushs news 
conference thursday 
president bush well i have a brief statement and then ill be 
glad to take some questions the united states is engaged in a 
collective effort involving the overwhelming majority of the member 
states of the united nations to reverse the consequences of iraqi 
aggression and our goals enshrined in five security council 
resolutions are clear the immediate and unconditional withdrawal 
of iraqi forces from kuwait the restoration of kuwaits legitimate 
government the stability of saudi arabia and the persian gulf and 
the protection of american citizens 
what is at stake here is truly significant the dependability 
of americas commitments to its friends and allies the shape of 
the postpostwar world opposition to aggression the potential 
domination of the energy resources that are crucial to the entire 
world 
this effort has been truly international from the very outset 
many other countries are contributing at last count 22 countries 
have either responded to a request from saudi arabia to help deter 
further aggression or are contributing maritime forces pursuant to 
united nations security council resolution 665 
and still others are providing other forms of financial and 
material support to these defense efforts or to countries whose 
economies are affected adversely by sanctions or by higher oil 
prices and still others are paying a heavy economic price at home 
for complying with the united nations sanctions 
it is important that the considerable burden of the effort be 
shared by those being defended and those who benefit from the free 
flow of oil indeed anyone with a stake in international order has 
an interest in ensuring that all of us succeed 
the united states has large interests in the balance and has 
undertaken commitments commensurate with them and were more than 
willing to bear our fair share of the burden this includes above 
all the thousands of men and women in our armed forces who are now 
in the gulf but we also expect others to bear their fair share 
a number of countries already have announced their willingness 
to help those adversely affected economically by this endeavor and 
its essential though that this be a concerted and coordinated 
one and that all affected countries participate 
it is important to get the priorities right and make sure that 
those most deserving of assistance receive it and that those most 
able to contribute do so and for that reason i directed an 
interagency effort to develop a strategy to accomplish this 
objective the groups report was presented at yesterdays national 
security council meeting here and this morning i approved an 
action plan 
and our approach calls for substantial economic assistance to 
those states in particular id single out turkey and egypt who 
are bearing a great part of the burden of sanctions and higher oil 
prices the plan also targets additional countries including 
jordan the countries of eastern europe and others for special 
assistance 
the united states will also seek burdensharing for part of our 
own effort at the same time we will be asking other governments 
including japan the republic of korea federal republic of 
germany saudi arabia the emirates free kuwait and others to 
join us in making available financial and where appropriate 
energy resources to countries that have been most affected by the 
current situation 
to facilitate this undertaking ive asked secretary of state 
jim baker and the secretary of the treasury nick brady to lead 
highlevel delegations to the persian gulf europe and asia and 
ill be getting directly in touch with the leaders of these 
countries before secretaries baker and brady arrive to set forth 
spell out our general objectives 
let me close by repeating what i said the other day in meeting 
with the congressional leaders the basic pieces of our policy are 
in place the iraqi regime stands in opposition to the entire world 
and to the interests of the iraqi people it is truly iraq against 
the world but i want to make this point clear we have no argument 
with the people of iraq 
the sanctions are beginning to take hold and in the meantime 
we want to ensure that countries contributing to this unprecedented 
collective response do not suffer for doing so and what ive 
announced today and what i expect will be implemented in the coming 
days should help create a context in which sanctions against iraq 
can be sustained with the intended effect 
another area where there has been unprecedented international 
solidarity is opecs willingness to take up the slack in oil 
production created by the embargo on iraqi and kuwaits oil in 
this connection i met this morning with our energy advisers who 
are watching the oil production situation very very closely and 
we are pleased with opecs decision to help take up the slack in 
crude oil production and although we are in what i would see as a 
transition period the situation appears manageable 
at the present time we dont anticipate major imbalances in the 
oil market but we do have the strategic petroleum reserve tested 
and available if it is truly needed and our energy policy is 
resulting in increased oil production and fuel switching to natural 
gas and to other fuels 
i also repeat my previous request for americans to conserve and 
for all parties to act responsibly right now the situation i 
would say is relative stable and i am very pleased by the 
coordination that has taken place with so many countries in 
maintaining adequate fuel levels

savings and loan prosecutions would be hobbled 
by spending cuts that would take effect if congress and the white 
house dont agree on ways to reduce the deficit the justice 
department said thursday 
the dallas sampl task force which has obtained more than 50 
convictions since 1987 would be virtually shut down as a result of 
a 324 percent spending cut that would take effect when the new 
fiscal year begins oct 1 the department said 
new investigations of sampl fraud nationwide would be postponed 
because of furloughs of justice department prosecutors that would 
be required the department said 
the criminal division would be unable to carry out its mandate 
in resolving the savings and loan crisis deputy attorney general 
william p barr said in a letter released by the department 
the spending cuts would take effect if congress and president 
bush dont reach agreements on alternative ways to cut spending or 
raise taxes 
barrs letter to budget director richard darman outlined a 
number of ways in which the mandatory spending cut would hurt the 
justice department which this week began sending furlough notices 
to virtually all its 80000 employees 
the letter appeared calculated to pressure congress into ending 
the budget stalemate with the bush administration 
budget talks that began in may have produced no breakthroughs 
and are in recess during congress august break bargainers have 
been looking for 50 billion in new taxes and spending cuts for 
fiscal 1991 and 500 billion over five years 
negotiations are resuming sept 7 with sessions at andrews air 
force base in maryland just outside the capital in hopes that a 
secluded location will expedite a deal 
the justice department says the fbi in addition to furloughs of 
agents for 22 days in the coming fiscal year is planning to lay 
off 6160 employees to save 308 million 
for the fbi the 1991 sequester would significantly reduce the 
bureaus ability to thwart terrorist activity that may result from 
the current iraqi crisis barr wrote 
as for the sampl cases the presidents financial institution 
fraud initiative would be severely hampered curtailing current 
investigations and prohibiting the initiation of new 
investigations barr said 
bush asked congress to spend another 25 million to expand 
prosecution after criticism that his administration was dragging 
its feet on the investigation of thrift fraud 
the sequester would eliminate rapid response teams that 
attorney general dick thornburgh announced would be set up to 
quickly investigate allegations of sampl fraud before large sums of 
depositors money is lost barr said 
employee furloughs could last from 22 days to more than 100 
days depending on the division or component of the agency barr 
said furloughs are expected to last up to 105 days for 3800 
prosecutors in the nations 94 us attorneys offices 
the departments civil division would have to furlough its 
employees as long as 86 days and shut down litigation in hundrds 
of cases including many arising from the sampl crisis barr said 
the cost to the treasury of the loss of this caseload will 
result in expenditures or lost revenues that could go as high as 
108 billion barr said 
the government would have to forgo the chance to collect 
billions of dollars by furloughing tax attorneys up to 77 days 
the drug enforcement administration would lose a third of its 
3000 agents to furloughs resulting in a drastic reduction 
efforts to stop cocaine production in south america barr said

about 250 militant armenian nationalists gave up 
their weapons thursday after the republic declared a state of 
emergency and surrounded their headquarters with soldiers police 
and tanks 
the surrender was a major victory for armenias parliament 
which declared independence from the soviet union last week by 
reining in the militants with forces under its direct control no 
troops from the central soviet government were involved the 
parliament dramatically emphasized its authority 
lawmakers had voted unanimously wednesday to outlaw the militant 
group which called itself the armenian national army the vote 
followed a night of violence in which militants attacked a gas 
station killed a legislator and fired automatic rifles at a rival 
organizations headquarters 
the militants holed up in three buildings in the republics 
capital of yerevan at first ignored an ultimatum from the 
parliament to surrender by 10 pm wednesday or face a military 
showdown armenian officials said 
after several hours of fruitless negotiations between 
parliamentary representatives and armenian national army leaders 
about 500 government soldiers and police moved into the buildings 
at about 130 am thursday they met no resistance soviet media 
reported 
later two leaders of the paramilitary group appealed on 
television for the remaining members to turn themselves in 
peacefully 
they did not explain their reasons for surrendering but 
armenian government loyalists said the militants had been convinced 
that they faced overwhelming force and that resistance would 
endanger innocent lives 
the state of emergency and a 10 pm to 6 am curfew remained 
in effect throughout the republic but no fighting was reported 
this was the quietest night in the republic in the past six 
months armenian president levon terpetrosyan told the 
230member parliament thursday the people have seen that the 
republic has a real government and that this government works 
among the weapons surrendered by the militants were 
approximately 60 rifles and shotguns a few hundred rounds of 
ammunition several hand grenades and 1540 pounds of explosives 
said ovanes muradyan a spokesman for the armenian national 
movement a group loyal to the republics government 
muradyan speaking by telephone from yerevan said government 
forces believe that some ana members managed to sneak out of the 
buildings during the night with automatic rifles 
he said some members of the group turned themselves in after the 
television appeal by leaders razmik vasilyan and vardan vardanyan 
but the number still holding out is very difficult to determine 
because the ana was a guerrilla kind of organization and never had 
any constant places of deployment except the headquarters 
the group is believed to have comprised a few hundred hardcore 
fighters and many more sympathizers it claimed to serve as a 
voluntary militia protecting armenians from attacks by militants in 
the neighboring republic of azerbaijan but it occasionally 
attacked armenian government targets such as fuel depots and 
police stations to steal weapons and gasoline 
longstanding ethnic tensions between armenia and azerbaijan 
flared two years ago into fighting for jurisdiction over 
nagornokarabakh a region within azerbaijan that is populated 
mainly by armenians more than 300 people have been killed in the 
dispute 
armenian authorities said all but a handful of the members of 
the armenian national army who surrendered were released and will 
not be prosecuted parliament had promised an amnesty to militants 
who turned in their weapons 
raffi hovannisian a representative of the washingtonbased 
armenian assembly of america said in a telephone interview from 
yerevan that the militants surrendered partly in the interest of 
armenian solidarity 
there was an immense amount of negotiation and i think they 
were persuaded that all military forces should be under the 
governments control hovannisian said 
they also realized they were facing superior forces and that 
if it came to a fight innocent blood might be spilled he added

ask red thompson what he likes about 
alachua county and he says its got quietness others in this 
place of pines and live oaks say the same 
but the quiet has been shattered by seven slayings two in this 
rural bedroom community and five in shaken gainesville 20 miles 
away all in less than a week 
thats as many homicides as in six months last year 
authorities dont believe the melrose killings discovered 
wednesday are related to the student slayings in gainesville home 
of the university of florida and yet they came at a time when 
tensions were already high 
alachua county is eager to get back to its normal self a place 
where people come to study to raise cattle or perhaps to be healed 
at famous hospitals it will get quiet again residents say 
its a great place to live says liz kubisek a resident 
since 1972 i wouldnt let this change my mind 
she keeps statistics for the county sheriffs department and 
said there were nine homicides last year outside the gainesville 
city limits 
thats added to five last year in the city said patrick 
callahan of the gainesville police who added that the mutilations 
involved in some of the recent killings added to their impact 
its not so much the numbers as the intensity thats freaking 
people out he said 
thompson who sells real estate from an office in melrose 
agreed 
all of this is coming on so fast its kind of overwhelming 
us he said 
last night i have to say was the first time in months i 
locked my doors 
for many life normally revolves around fishing in the scores of 
lakes hereabouts those who dont farm mostly commute to jobs in 
gainesville en route they might pass a sign that offers horse 
for sale or blueberries 
its a hardworking county its a peaceful county thompson 
said 
the concentration of educational institutions in alachua county 
gives its population the youngest median age in florida according 
to county manager bob fernandez 
tragically that uniqueness may have been a factor in the first 
five killings the victims were all students three at the 
university of florida and the two at nearby santa fe community 
college 
in the midst of budget meetings fernandez said the killings 
have put everyday activities in a new perspective 
we dont spend a lot of time now haggling over the price of a 
dump truck he said 
it goes without saying he added that people in the county look 
forward to getting back to normal 
for local government that means among other things continuing 
to work toward a more diversified economy one less dependent on 
the university 
nationwide insurance co has a regional office in the county and 
some wellknown hospitals including shands medical center make 
the area a health magnet fernandez said but more employers 
are always being sought 
for much of the county getting back to normal will mean keeping 
up with the florida gators football team 
the county fair is coming up in november and 4hers will get 
their livestock ready 
and some people will just want to get out to paynes prairie an 
18000acre state wildlife sanctuary south of gainesville theyll 
be listening for the quiet

and now i would be glad to take some questions whos first 
terry 
q mr president saddam hussein has rejected demands that he 
pull his troops out of kuwait and hes holding several thousand 
foreigners hostage to keep the world at bay you say you dont see 
much chance for diplomacy to work how long can the west allow this 
impasse to go on and would you take any action that might endanger 
the lives of those hostages 
a it will go on as long as it takes to have these united 
nations sanctions fully implemented and i am glad that these 
diplomatic efforts are taking place perhaps one will hit pay dirt 
but as of now i must say im not optimistic because the man 
keeps reiterating terms that are simply fly in the face of the 
united nations action 
and on the second question look i feel very concerned about 
americans that are held against their will but we cannot permit 
hostagetaking to shape the foreign policy of this country and i 
wont permit it to do that 
q so does that mean that their lives would be expendable if you 
judge the 
a its too too hypothetical a question it means i will not 
change the policy of the united states and i dont think other 
leaders whose foreign nationals are in this same predicament will 
change their policies to pay to pay pay homage or to give 
credibility to this brutal move of staking out citizens and not 
and a brutal move of holding people against their will 
q mr president there are reports that theres a split in your 
administration some who want to expand the goals to include the 
ouster eventual ouster of saddam and also there are many many 
suggestions for a middle east conference that would include in the 
in what you would call the postpostwar shape of the world the 
perennial problems of the middle east what do you think on both of 
those 
a what i think on the second part of the question that we 
ought to get on with the business at hand the shorterrun 
business which is the solution to this question or the making 
right the situation in kuwait meaning the pulling out of forces 
obviously and the restoration of the rulers i do as i look at 
the countries that are chipping in here now i think we do have a 
chance at a new world order and id like to think that out of this 
dreary performance by saddam hussein there could be now an 
opportunity for peace all through the middle east 
but its its we have to get we have to be sure that whats 
been undertaken so far is successful before we can we can move to 
that other agenda it seems to me 
q well would you support then a conference afterwards i 
mean this may be premature but the question is are you shooting 
for that 
a i havent thats not an objective a conference peace 
through the middle east is an objective and as you know we have 
never ruled out a conference of any nature in fact it was part 
of an active part of our diplomacy just several years ago but i 
dont want to get out ahead of the where we are right now on 
this the question right now is what do we do to get saddam hussein 
to comply with international law i left out you had another part 
of it 
q are you do you want to get him out of his job do you want 
to get him out of 
a well it didnt wouldnt disappoint me if the iraqis got up 
and said look this man is our problem ive said right here 
the problem is not with the people in iraq simply isnt and but 
i ive spelled out our objectives here and i i would i 
stopped short of adding to them what you know the answer that you 
were seeking from me on the president 
q mr president some have expressed the fear that saddam 
hussein might seek to inflame the arab world against the united 
states by drawing israel into the conflict here perhaps by a 
strike against jordan can you tell us if youre prepared for such 
a contingency and if so how 
a well thats again hypothetical i cant predict what hes 
going to do but i can tell you that we are we are continuing to 
implement our forces and we are continuing to take all the 
diplomatic moves that are necessary to prepare for any eventuality 
q well let me just follow up by asking a question about 
jordans participation in the un sanctions there are numerous 
reports coming out of the east some quoting israeli intelligence 
to the effect that jordan is a highway really for supplies still 
reaching iraq are you aware of those reports and what 
a im aware of some but brit it is my view that that 
based on what ive seen most recently that commerce has come down 
to a bit of a trickle there there were reports of enormous numbers 
of trucks being being laid up no goods to transport 
so i dont know how effective it is right now i do know that 
king hussein told me looking me right in the eye that they were 
going to comply with the sanctions but ive seen reports that 
indicate theres some leakage there but i just cant give you the 
quantity i just dont know 
its my feeling that commerce through the aqaba the port of 
aqaba and indeed through jordan going to iraq and viceversa has 
slowed down regrettably theres a lot of refugee traffic and i 
think thats hurting the saddam hussein image because people see 
the humblest being brutalized the most and they see a lot of 
refugees out there and i think thats sending a not a very good 
signal as far as hes concerned

former hostage brian keenan on thursday 
urged negotiations for the release of remaining captives in 
lebanon with whom he formed an enduring and unbreakable bond 
during years in tiny basement cells 
keenan a teacher released last week after being held 4 years 
said he often spent weeks in dark chambers suffered repeated 
beatings and rarely spoke above a whisper 
its time to talk its obviously time to talk there is a 
willingness why not talk keenan said during a 75minute news 
conference 
keenan 39 said he saw two of the six remaining american 
hostages associated press journalist terry anderson and university 
professor thomas sutherland about 11 months ago at the time both 
were well he said 
extremist groups believed linked to iran still hold 13 western 
hostages the six americans four britons two west germans and an 
italian 
keenan a native of belfast northern ireland who holds dual 
irishbritish citizenship was handed over to irish authorities in 
syria on saturday he was released from mater hospital in dublin on 
thursday 
he was teaching english in beirut at the time of his capture on 
april 11 1986 
appearing pale and thin keenan periodically gulped back tears 
while describing his captivity 
hostage is crucifying aloneness theres a silent screaming 
slide into the bowels of ultimate despair keenan said reading 
from a handwritten statement 
hostage is a man hanging by his fingernails over the edge of 
chaos and feeling his fingers slowly straightening 
tiny tiny cells constant blindfolds prolonged days in the 
dark sometimes weeks without light create kinds of insanity that 
drive men deep deep into themselves he said 
keenan described 42yearold anderson the aps chief middle 
east correspondent as pacing the floor in tattered socks with a 
voracious appetite for intellectual conversation 
he said anderson sometimes kept him awake for hours with 
conversation 
i think he debated with himself a lot while we tried to plug 
our ears keenan joked 
keenan said guards sometimes gave anderson antibiotics during 
bouts of stomach trouble 
terry and myself would sit through those long nights and speak 
with great pain and remorse and longing for his first daughter 
gabrielle with many tears he would elaborate his plans when he was 
finally back in the states to help her to shape and discover her 
future 
in those confessional moments which were common to us all a 
deep and enduring and unbreakable bond was formed 
anderson has never seen his second daughter sulome born three 
months after he was abducted 
anderson abducted march 16 1985 is the longestheld of the 13 
westerners sutherland was kidnapped june 9 1985 
keenan said sutherland 59 who was dean of agriculture at the 
american university of beirut at the time of his kidnapping taught 
him french using broken matchsticks cigarette papers and an 
ancient french historical novel which i never want to read again 
keenan said he and a british hostage television journalist john 
mccarthy were held with the two americans and a nowfreed us 
hostage frank reed for eight months 
keenan a bachelor wore a tshirt designed by a group called 
the friends john mccarthy keenan said he spent the most time with 
mccarthy and that the two became quite close 
keenans voice broke as he speculated how mccarthy who was 
kidnapped april 17 1986 must be feeling now 
other people one begins to look at with strange mistrustful 
apprehension but the irrepressible wit that is the golden kernel 
of john coped ultimately and always emerged he said 
keenan had no news of anglican church envoy terry waite who 
disappeared in jan 20 1987 while on a mission to beirut to 
negotiate the release of hostages 
but he noted he may have recently heard another hostage 
i felt in the last place we were in there was certainly 
another hostage whom i heard in the early hours of the morning 
saying oh no oh no that could be french that could be 
anything said keenan 
keenan said his captors were mainly aged about 30 poorly 
educated and that some beat the captives until the last nine 
months when the food and general treatment significantly improved 
he said some guards refused to take part in the beatings and 
one as a gesture of remorse brought him an apple 
i feel no desire for vengeance keenan said i dont 
intend maiming myself by going into a rage of anger i see no 
purpose in it 
some of those men who held us and who could speak english were 
reasonable they did talk of their faith they did talk of 
islam they gave us a koran which we had for a year with no other 
reading material it was not an attempt to convert us keenan 
said 
keenan said the captors asked if some of the hostages would like 
to convert to islam 
we simply held up chains and said no chance pal

the aquarium of the americas opens saturday 
on the edge of the citys historic french quarter hailed by its 
director as the nations premier aquarium 
built with donations and a special property tax the aquarium 
was fought by landowners who think it will ruin the areas historic 
qualities and bring in traffic and noise but their lawsuit failed 
and the 40 million aquarium stands ready for a projected 870000 
visitors the first year 
each aquarium grows and learns from the last experience that 
youve had at an aquarium says l ron forman executive director 
of the audubon institute a nonprofit group that runs the audubon 
zoo and the aquarium 
this has taken all of the technologies of the national 
aquarium in baltimore and the monterey bay aquarium in california 
and brought them to new orleans 
the milliongallon 110000squarefoot aquarium sits on the 
mississippi river sixty fresh and salt water displays ranging from 
500 to 500000 gallons house more than 7500 specimens from 395 
species of marine life 
the displays will be geared around four major exhibits a 
caribbean reef environment an amazon rainforest a mississippi 
river and delta habitat and a gulf of mexico exhibit 
the project was financed by 25 million in public bonds backed 
by a special property tax approved by city voters in 1986 and by 
15 million in donations 
despite more than 70 percent approval of the aquarium tax there 
were some who worked to stop the project 
a group of french quarter landowners sued accusing the army 
corps of engineers of approving the project in violation of the 
national historic preservation act 
a federal appeals court ruled against the group last year in 
january the us supreme court refused to hear arguments in the 
suit which was backed by the national trust for historic 
preservation in the united states a private organization chartered 
by congress 
claims that the aquarium which is adjacent to the ultramodern 
canal place hotel and shopping arcade complex will take away from 
the quarters bawdy centuriesold appeal are unfounded forman 
says traffic congestion noise and parking problems predicted for 
the 1984 worlds fair two blocks upriver never materialized 
the aquariums initial operating budget will be about 10 
million annually and no city money will be needed for operations 
after it opens forman says admission is 750 for adults 4 for 
children 
city officials are counting on the aquarium and the adjacent 
17acre woldenberg riverfront park which provides much needed 
green space for residents of the citys french quarter to help 
attract more family tourists 
new orleans has basically had the flavor that its an adult 
town said aquarium spokesman eileen lumarjohnson 
we think that we will draw more tourists because we will in 
fact have some impact on the citys image as a family attraction

police clashed for a second 
day thursday with students protesting black factional fighting and 
the government said the conflict was forcing it to spend money on 
security instead of social services 
witnesses in cape town said students hurled stones at police 
who fired birdshot in return and injured at least two protesters 
the students were demanding an end to battles between xhosas who 
mostly support the african national congress and zulus who back 
the conservative inkatha movement 
officials of the transkei homeland where many xhosas are from 
complained thursday that south african authorities had left bodies 
of victims of the fighting to rot outside johannesburg area 
mortuaries 
they said people who traveled to the city to identify the dead 
were unable to recognize their relatives because the bodies had 
decomposed 
one is bound to ask why are the corpses of the people who died 
in such a violent manner further desecrated in this way the 
transkei statement said is it because they are black 
inkatha and the anc both oppose apartheid but differ on the 
shape of a future south africa inkatha has accused the anc of 
terrorizing other black groups in a bid to consolidate power 
zulu and xhosa tribal leaders met thursday and agreed to make a 
joint plea for an end to the fighting at least 500 people have 
died since the factional fighting broke out on aug 12 in the 
townships around johannesburg 
foreign affairs minister pik botha said he has told anc deputy

message of instability to the rest of the world and will leave

forced the government to spend money on security instead of social 
problems 
those stoking unrest must also decide whether they want money 
for education or if we must spend it on the police and military 
personnel who have to try and sort out the trouble he said 
mandela is under pressure from the government and other black 
leaders to meet with zulu leader mangosuthu buthelezi the anc has 
rejected talks with buthelezi contending he serves as a government 
pawn to divide the black majority

q sir youre going to return to kennebunkport this afternoon 
may i ask how bothered you may have been by the opinion of many 
americans many of whom think youre doing a great job in this 
crisis who nonetheless are bothered by you going out and fishing 
and golfing while in command of the troops in the gulf 
a no im not bothered by it ive expressed myself on that if 
i were bothered i wouldnt be going back there for the labor day 
weekend with my family and i think the american people are 
supporting strongly what im doing so i and i would repeat im 
in very close touch ive done a lot of the diplomatic work that 
has gone into this project from my house there received a couple 
of foreign visitors there have had many briefings there and i 
think the american people are fundamentally fair and i think they 
see that so it im not troubled by it if i were i suspect i 
wouldnt be going back again 
q marlin fitzwater at one point said that you were pretty 
adamant and stubborn about it thinking saying to him at one 
point that you needed a rest is that what it boiled down to 
fitzwater i beg your pardon 
a yeah i need some rest and i havent gotten as much as id 
like but i wouldnt call it adamant or stubborn because i 
refuse to he better not have either marlins going through kind 
of a downer though because the iraqi spokesman has the matching 
tie and hankie you know so its been a little difficult 
charles 
q on the question of your needing rest 
a huh 
q you were about to answer the question 
a no i think i do im getting some not as much as id like 
but its been very pleasant there and yet ive managed to 
accomplish my objectives in terms of work too 
q mr president on the question of burdensharing since youre 
sending your envoys out it sounds like you have not gotten the 
voluntary contributions you might have liked to have gotten can 
you give us a sense of how much youre looking for and where you 
expect to find it 
a no i dont think its a question of doing this because we 
havent gotten what we think is fair for other countries and for 
the and for burdensharing generally what were talking about 
here charles is a consulting and coordinating effort and weve 
had strong indications of support but now we are moving up a 
little bit and trying to take the lead here leadership in helping 
sort out who should help whom and somebody has to do that and 
weve made a significant commitment in various ways and so it 
seemed appropriate that we take the lead in working with our 
friends and allies 
but look prime minister kaifu called me last night you know 
we didnt need a mission for this and made a significant 
contribution and then pledged to do more in terms of support for 
other countries now that is very good and that was voluntary but 
it needs to be coordinated somebody needs to take the lead on 
saying look we dont put all the money to this one country 
several countries are involved here and lets see that these 
generous responses are fairly allocated 
q if i could follow up there have been concerns expressed 
about the japanese not making any military contribution they could 
send minesweepers or something like that is money not enough in 
the japanese case and what has happened to the your good friend 
helmut kohl who seemed extraordinarily silent 
a well i dont i wouldnt say money is not enough im fully 
aware of the constraints on the japanese and i have not pressed 
him to go beyond what his constitution provides helmut kohl i 
think theyll be very responsive and part of part of what were 
talking about here is to follow up on comments like the ones helmut 
kohl made to me about we want to be a part of this we want to 
help so i have no argument with the germans at all yes 
q is the united states doing anything to help the kuwaiti 
underground the kuwaiti rebels training supplies anything 
a one i wouldnt comment on it two but in a broad way i 
support the kuwaiti underground i support anybody that can have a 
hand in restoring legitimacy there to kuwait and to getting the 
iraqis out of kuwait 
q all right but how do you justify it legally under the un 
resolutions which dont seem to call for any support activity to 
the underground 
a well im just encouraging people who are patriots and feel 
that their country has been pillaged and aggressed against 
q well would you draw the line at sending the green berets or 
some sort of american military force on crossborder raids and if 
you 
a just too hypothetical ive given you the principle if there 
were some some quiet support which i wouldnt ever confirm or 
deny because we never comment on those matters i would simply 
leave it out there because but you say am i supportive of i 
think what you said was resistance and id be supportive of 
anybody that wants to try to fulfill the ambitions of the the 
statements that the world has made through the united nations 
q but you didnt rule out crossborder raids by american 
military personnel either 
a well im not if they were going to happen let me be 
clear on this if it were going to happen i wouldnt comment on 
it that would be the dumbest thing i could possibly do in my 
view to tip your hat but i have no plans for that right now yeah

president bush said thursday that his request 
for other nations to share in the cost of the us military 
presence in the middle east does not put american forces in the 
role of mercenaries 
i wouldnt have them look like mercenaries bush said at a 
news conference there are ways that burdensharing can be 
accomplished without making forces mercenary 
a mercenary is a professional soldier hired to serve in a 
foreign army it was common in the past for states to recruit 
entire forces from another state to fight its battles 
bush said fuel and transportation were areas where other 
countries could contribute to the cost of maintaining us forces 
in the middle east 
bush said members of congress had expressed concern about us 
soldiers being regarded as mercenaries under a burdensharing plan 
us forces should never appear to be mercenary forces he 
said 
modern mercenaries often find work in the civil and territorial 
wars of the third world

us marines have established a 
camp a relatively short distance from the saudi troops manning the 
front lines in the standoff with iraq military sources said 
thursday 
the camp represents the forwardmost movement of us ground 
forces in saudi arabia the movement made over the past few days 
was described by the sources as routine and not a sign of any 
imminent hostilities 
you dont keep marines behind everybody else thats not what 
we have the marines for said one of the sources who spoke on 
the condition of anonymity 
this source discussed the forward movement of the marines into 
northeast saudi arabia on the condition the exact location not be 
disclosed 
the second source when asked about the reported movement 
confirmed some marines had moved north into the desert from a 
staging area more than 150 miles from the border they had used for 
initial desert exercises and to grow acclimated to the saudi 
climate 
a navy spokesman capt mike sherman said he could not discuss 
troop deployments the military planned to take reporters to a 
marine camp in northeast saudi arabia on friday sherman said he 
did not know the exact location 
the first source stressed the marines still were behind the 
saudi forces stationed near the kingdoms border with occupied 
kuwait 
the move was not directly related to the recent additions of 
iraqi forces along its border with saudi arabia the source said 
but obviously as we get more people in country we are going to 
spread them around and it makes sense to move them toward the 
border than away from it the source said

hostage thomas sutherland is a dapper 
mr chips who has exercised rigorously and dreamed of his aging 
volvo during 5 years in captivity in lebanon former hostage brian 
keenan said thursday 
sutherland a scottishborn american was acting dean of 
agriculture at the american university of beirut when he was 
abducted june 9 1985 he was known to his fellow captives as the 
dean keenan said 
for many hours we would sit with him while he delivered 
fascinating lectures on genetics and animal husbandry keenan 
told reporters thursday he came to us in these awful places as 
kind of light illuminating our darkness warming that chill that 
despair 
keenan remembered sutherland 59 as courteous in manner and 
very very great in heart certainly a veritable mr 
chips referring to the english schoolmaster of james hiltons 
novel goodbye mr chips 
of all of us perhaps that man was the least prepared by life 
for the horror he now endures said keenan 
though given to long periods of crushing depression he gave 
selflessly of his knowledge to us all he said 
keenan said sutherland talked frequently of the volvo he bought 
new 27 years ago 
we each of us knew that volvo extremely well keenan said 
the dean still clings with a stubborn tenacity that he might 
even yet return and complete his work at the american university of 
beirut sutherland was on leave from the faculty of colorado state 
university and had worked in beirut for two years 
i watched his eyes light in dazzling enthusiasm as he took 
several hours a day to teach me french with a consortium of broken 
matchsticks cigarette papers and an ancient french historical 
novel which i never want to read again in my life keenan said 
tom like most of us maintained his little vanities he keeps 
running he keeps exercising and trying to keep his slim good looks 
such things are absurd perhaps when you havent seen a 
mirror for 5 years in toms case yet they are those lifegiving 
harmless idiosyncracies which keep a man from sliding and giving 
way 
anyway keenan said he is a handsome old devil

gov roy romer defended his staffs decision not 
to send a letter of commendation to two new jersey teenagers who 
earned eagle scout medals in a flap that saw a talk radio host 
chide the governor 
i dont think its the job of the governor of colorado to give 
commendations to every eagle scout in the country romer said in 
a call wednesday to a talk show on radio station koa which had 
criticized him for his failure to laud the teens 
the governor complained about koas treatment of the issue and 
the whole role of talk radio talk show host george weber 
replied take a sedative governor 
the parents of douglas baker 14 and derek kahill 17 both of 
oradell nj sent letters to 50 governors asking them to 
congratulate the teens 
fortynine governors and president bush complied but a romer 
aide replied that the governor couldnt send letters of 
congratulations to eagle scouts outside of the state because of the 
number of requests and a limited budget 
the eagle scout medal is the highest honor awarded to boy 
scouts only about 2 percent achieve it 
both baker and kahill were telephone guests on the radio 
program were not trying to cause trouble were just 
disappointed that your governor didnt recognize what we did

journalist terry anderson the 
longestheld western hostage in lebanon has talked tirelessly 
about his family and remained convinced he will someday be freed to 
pursue plans to aid troubled boys former captive brian keenan said 
thursday 
keenan described anderson as a bit of a bulky and belligerent 
newspaperman who had a voracious hunger for intellectual 
conversation 
and when he did not get it would pace the floor endlessly in 
his patched and repatched and much more patched but still very 
holey socks said keenan who was released to irish authorities 
in syria on saturday 
anderson kidnapped in beirut on march 16 1985 is the chief 
middle east correpondent for the associated press keenan said he 
last saw anderson 11 months ago after being held with him for 
eight months anderson was born in lorain ohio and grew up in 
batavia ny 
keenan said anderson 42 and other the hostages frequently 
suffered from beirut belly which he said is not a pleasant 
illness 
guards generally ignored the hostages complaints of illness but 
would sometimes hand out antibiotics keenan said 
and so having had some ease from his beirut belly terry 
would be back again to his forceful debates on many subjects which 
kept us awake for many hours keenan said 
i think terry debated with himself a lot while we tried to 
plug our ears with bits of mattress and bits of pillow 
yes terry will also like us all take his periods of despair 
and seek solace in his family terry and perhaps myself would 
sit through those long nights speak with much pain and remorse and 
a great longing and love for his first daughter gabrielle 
she is a much older child than when he last he saw her and 
with many tears he would elaborate his plans to bring her to the 
states to have that fatherly sharing of love and affection with 
her to help her to shape and discover her future 
in these confessional moments which were common to us all a 
deep and enduring and unbreakable bond was formed keenan said 
beyond the bluster which we each maintained terrys life was 
shaping itself toward his children with this deep burden of love 
this deep burden of need 
but terrys aggressive quality has not left him i watched him 
and worked with him as he did over all the years design and evolve 
a project for a school for young delinquent boys in america 
everything worked out in fine meticulous and authoritative detail 
indeed quite a masterpiece of thought and the depth of conviction 
he felt so committed to these things that he inspired us to our own 
survival projects said keenan 
asked whether anderson was confident that he would some day be 
free keenan replied simply yes

q mr president a related question about this there are some 
iraqi opposition groups in london and elsewhere and the kurds and 
theyve all said in recent weeks theyve heard nothing from your 
administration if anything theyve been encouraged just to that 
the united states only wants covert contacts with them why not if 
as you say you want the iraqi people to rise up why have you 
why has this administration not done anything with the opposition 
groups 
a weve got weve got a plan and the plan is to work 
diplomatically and the plan is to put on the ground a significant 
military force and if these comments i made today about anybody 
who wants to help the united nations and those of us who want to 
see iraq out of kuwait succeed so much the better 
q if i could just follow up you said also today you dont want 
to hurt the iraqi people but isnt this embargo and these 
sanctions only hurting them and hurting them first before they 
hurt saddam 
a theres nothing thats painless david when you get into a 
situation like this when you have a leader that is could 
brutalize his own people theres nothing thats painless in all of 
this 
q on the question of negotiations mr president are all 
channels still open specifically have there been any back channel 
contacts or proposals from white house officials that are worth 
pursuing 
a none that i know of 
q if i could follow on that sir saddam hussein has suggested 
that that you and he and margaret thatcher go on tv to debate 
this what do you say to that 
a i say you can put an empty chair there as far as im 
concerned 
q mr president in your pep talk to the armed services 
yesterday you mentioned the difficulty of the mission citing the 
weather isnt boredom even a bigger factor as weeks and into 
months over in the desert 
a well i i would hope not but im not sure its the worlds 
most exciting assignment if that whats you mean but i think 
therell be programs to keep morale high right now its 
extraordinarily high 
q a suggestion has been made that some reduction in the troops 
might be made in the days ahead to give a more international tinge 
to the force over there would you entertain such or support such 
a move 
a im im more interested in seeing the fulfillment of 
commitments made yeah 
q mr president youre about to begin a new round of budget 
negotiations federal employees are facing furloughs because of the 
grammrudman law and this operation is costing over 1 billion a 
month how do you assess the impact of the cost of operation desert 
shield on your budget problem 
a its difficult at this juncture to know fully what the impact 
will be clearly itll have some budget implications i have not 
moved off of my view that we must get a budget agreement with 
congress as soon as they get back and ill have more to say about 
that in the weeks ahead but i really havent changed my view on 
that and i think itll be very clear to members of congress that 
that the deficit problem has gotten worse as a result of the action 
that we have had to take 
q if i could follow that up 
a yes 
q sen leahy has suggested a sort of war tax to pay for this 
how do you feel about that concept 
a well i dont feel that the that the answer is a war tax 
yes rita 
q mr president do you have any problem with the live tv 
coverage of saddam husseins media events which a lot of people 
complain that this gives him a propaganda platform 
a no i have no complaints about it i think that that it 
hasnt helped him very much in with world opinion i dont know 
what its done at home maybe its been reassuring to the people 
there but i dont think that it is cutting into the desire to see 
the un sanctions fulfilled it i must say i havent seen the 
last couple of interviews with the man but its i think the one 
with the what he calls guests and what we call hostages 
was really so brutal and so totally unacceptable that it that it 
worked against him it was manipulative and cynical and so i 
havent been concerned that hes got a shot there 
hes had a real opportunity to present his case to the american 
people id like to have a similar opportunity to present our case 
to the people in iraq but i i have no no complains about that 
at all rita

q mr president could you accept a situation where iraq 
withdraws from kuwait but keeps its military power intact 
regardless of whos in charge 
a well again thats too hypothetical i want to see the goals 
that i stated fulfilled and of course i think part of that 
would be i think the world would demand that there be no no 
chance of a you know another invasion right the minute the 
minute this this ended 
q if i can follow sir sen lugar and some others have said 
this is something that we should discuss now 
a well we are discussing it now i had dinner with him last 
night as a matter of fact because i knew he felt that way it was 
a very good evening as a matter of fact i had about 11 12 
members of congress over there and it was helpful to me to get 
these diverse views i got some of the feeling of that from 
briefing the congress but i have great respect for dick lugar and 
so well be talking more but i have not changed my the 
objectives youll notice the publicly stated objectives here 
yeah 
q mr president what is the amount of money youre 
expecting from the allies 
a there is no total price tag that i have in mind yeah i do 
have to go in a couple of questions 
q mr president has 
a after after two 
q has israel served as a strategic ally in this crisis and is 
there anything you can do now to protect israel and saudi arabia 
against chemical attacks as was threatened today 
a israel has behaved very well and israel has never had 
difficulty defending itself and in terms of saudi arabia we are 
committed to the defense of saudi arabia and i believe that we 
have major stake in protecting them against that kind of further 
aggression 
q may i follow up on the countries youre asking for 
assistance have you asked south africa to contribute anything to 
this 
a i dont think we have asked any of these countries well we 
may have asked some of them so far but i dont know that there has 
been a request made of south africa or not yeah last one 
q mr president some of the members of congress who attended 
the meeting with you the other day left here with the feeling that 
the longer situation drags on the lesser the chance there is of 
outright fighting involving us troops at the moment what is your 
assessment of the risk of fighting involving our forces 
a well its so hard to answer that question because of the 
unpredictable nature of saddam hussein himself and so i think 
its almost impossible i have had meetings today with some of our 
top analysts and specialists on the arab world and im not i 
dont want to put words in their mouth but that was one of the 
questions that i asked and its very hard to get a to predict 
its very hard to measure intentions 
but i think the answer is to have the forces in place to be 
ready i would think that the defense of south of saudi arabia is 
far more assured today that it was two weeks ago because the 
united states and others have moved substantial forces there and 
theyre ready and theyre strong and theyre able and their morale 
is high and similarly theres a lot of naval power and of 
course air power thats there and i would think that that would 
be a deterrent to any anybody with any degree of rationality 
having said that i dont know what it what is in this mans mind 
q to follow up sir 
q in the back sir 
q to follow up sir what actions by iraq would trigger 
what actions by iraq sir would trigger a us response 
a well that is too broad a question to get a response from 
but i we are ready and if there is some provocative action why 
then wed have to make a determination at that time but i cant 
i just cant help you your questions too broad last one from 
texas craig and then ive got to go i really do 
q mr president 
q mr president i 
a yeah craig 
q thank you mr president 
a this isnt your back of the room here 
q are you concerned that this burden sharing as you call it is 
going to make american forces look like mercenaries in the middle 
east 
a well i wouldnt want to have anything done that would make 
them look like mercenaries but i dont think so in fact we would 
be very careful that that conclusion could not be drawn i raised 
that question to some one of the members of congress asked me 
that and said i dont want the mercenary forces 
but there are ways that burden sharing can be accomplished 
without making the forces mercenary and im thinking of the 
enormous fuel bills that are involved and transportation and these 
kinds of things that are involved in moves of this nature but im 
glad you raised it because us forces should never appear to be 
mercenary forces and that will not be the outcome of this i can 
guarantee you 
thank you all very much thank you so much 
q mr president what do you make of the back and forth on the 
women and children 
the president does not respond to the last question

the militarys stars and stripes 
newspaper said thursday that some us air force crews flying 
troops and supplies to saudi arabia suffer from fatigue and are 
pushing safety to the limit 
also thursday wolfgang hofmann a spokesman for us air force 
europe at ramstein air base said it may take weeks to determine 
the cause of the crash of a us air force c5a transport plane 
wednesday that killed 13 people and injured four 
officials at the us army hospital in landstuhl said thursday 
the four injured were not in lifethreatening condition 
the most seriously injured was capt cynthia borecky who 
suffered broken ankles and burns to her hands and face said 
hospital spokesman staff sgt rourk sheehan 
the other three injured were recovering from lacerations and 
bruises and are expected to be released within five days sheehan 
said 
stars and stripes an authorized but unoffical military 
publication interviewed a c5 crew at rheinmain air base near 
frankfurt just hours after the ramstein crash 
thousands of us troops and tons of military supplies are being 
flown to saudi arabia through rheinmain in the desert shield 
operation 
considering fatigue limited crew rest and the long days were 
working weve shaved the safety margin in some instances as narrow 
as it should be shaved the newspaper quoted us air force lt 
col jack gray as saying 
gray is the commander of a c5 flight from dover air force base 
del he said he wouldnt speculate on what caused the ramstein 
crash 
but gray and his crew admitted fatigue has been a major concern 
during desert shield in which they have flown several missions to 
saudi arabia 
the newspaper quoted maj tam rogers as saying you can get 
burned out very easily guys can become walking zombies almost 
incapable of making good judgments 
many crews get only a 10to12hour layover after arriving in 
germany from the united states before flying on to saudi arabia 
stars and stripes reported 
officials at ramstein 90 miles south of frankfurt said the 
crew of the c5a that crashed had a 24hour break before taking off 
without specifically commenting on anything that was said in 
the article i have to make the point that during a major airlift 
operation the rules do not change for the military airlift 
command said col james murphy commander of the 608th military 
airlift group at ramstein murphys group handles scheduling of 
transport crews at the base 
he said when there is not a crisis situation such as the desert 
shield operation we are able to give the crews more rest 
murphy said air commanders are required to watch the performance 
of their crews to make sure they are not fatigued 
the aircraft commander can request additional rest time if he 
feels his crew is too tired to fly safely murphy said

excerpts from statement 
hostage is crucifying aloneness theres a silent screaming 
slide into the bowels of ultimate despair 
hostage is a man hanging by his fingernails over the edge of 
chaos and feeling his fingers slowly straightening 
hostage is the humiliating stripping away of every sense and 
fiber of body and mind and spirit that make you what you are 
hostage is a mutant creation full of selfloathing guilt and 
deathwishing but he is a man a rare unique and beautiful 
creation of which these things are no part 
you here the press have now a real opportunity to reach out 
and help those people whoever and whatever they are seize that 
chance to reach out and give part of yourselves to them 
there is no victory in condemnation or retribution that 
separates us from the finest and most creative part of our being as 
people all men everywhere seek that quality of justice by which 
they may fulfill their life and their life experience

how can i forget johnny mccarthy a british journalist and 
fellow hostages whose humor whose mimicry whose abundant love 
of life on so many times seemed to diminish to almost extinction 
those grinding moments of hopelessness 
im trying simply to say that this abundant love of life with 
john suffered as with us all a terrible and awful diminution and 
those moments of hopelessness were certainly a grinding of mind and 
of heart 
in johnboy i saw a man grow i saw a man deepen and it was a 
real joy to be a witness to that 
but sometimes unfortunately for us humor is johns forte and 
it infused and infested us all i remember how when we had no 
reading material for over a year we played 17hour marathon games 
of dominoes during those viciously competitive exercises in 
lunacy we adopted various personae can you imagine what it would 
be like to play with a viennese doctor who was having the most 
exciting sexualisms with some amazing but very plain hausfraus from 
bavaria was usual from john and he usually beat me with 
these exciting stories he would tell in his huge huge box of 
personalities 
there is a famous quotation from john milton the mind is its 
own place and in itself can make a heaven of hell or a hell of 
heaven the problem with that eloquent sentence is that how can 
you control the mind when the mind itself has already chosen to go 
its own way independent of ones will ones desire ones need 
each of us fathomed the depths of mania of despair that awful 
howling wilderness where one felt like no more than a speck of dust 
in an alien cosmos 
johnboys everpresent good nature and sanity touched us all 
with light and thrust us back to the world john was the youngest 
and our evening benediction frequently was a chorus of night 
johnboy night johnboy night johnboy johnboy was not pleased 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
we all often thought how could we relate to anyone how could 
we relate to anyone what we had been thinking tiny tiny cells 
constant blindfolds prolonged days in the dark sometimes weeks 
without light create kinds of insanity that drive men deep deep 
into themselves 
other people one begins to look at with strange mistrustful 
apprehension 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
i am sure that the first few days perhaps weeks will be one of 
the waves of manic states where you go up and down john is a 
strong man now he is a very strong man he will understand and his 
first thoughts will be good brian is home good brian is seeing 
my family his psychological condition will drop he is alone 
my one thought always is that the first time i was alone it 
didnt seem really so bad although there are moments i dont want 
to talk about however having been with john i never wanted to be 
alone again because you now had an experience of what it was to be 
alone so you knew what you didnt want and what was going to happen 
to you even though you were prepared its not always that one can 
have such grasp on the mind 
courage is not something thats got to do with physical strength 
or aggression courage is something that has to do with the ability 
to control fear my fear has different depths and different 
qualities some of it is beyond any mans ability to control fully

gov james blanchard and his spurned running 
mate longtime womens rights champion martha griffiths have 
buried the hatchet after their messy political split a campaign 
official said thursday 
blanchard and his twoterm lieutenant governor held a private 
meeting wednesday night their first since the governor dumped her 
from the ticket aug 24 his spokeswoman katie wolf said the 
meeting made unlikely an intraparty battle at the state democratic 
convention sept 79 in flint 
i think it means that well have a wonderful convention she 
said at least i anticipate that we will have a very unified 
convention and strong support for the governor 
the blanchardgriffiths reunion at an annual democratic 
legislative retreat on mackinac island also produced a denial from 
griffiths that she was referring to her boss when she talked used 
the term son of a bitch in an interview 
she was very very warm to the governor and friendly and told 
him some of the references printed in the paper she did not make in 
reference to him wolf said 
in an interview published in the detroit free press wednesday 
griffiths said to watch some son of a bitch youve done a 
big favor for turn around and hurt you is terrible 
griffiths later denied that she was referring specifically to 
blanchard and said she was just talking about politics in 
general the detroit news reported thursday 
griffiths said she will announce tuesday whether she will try to 
buck blanchards decision at the convention 
the convention must affirm blanchards choice for the second 
spot on the ticket which he has not yet revealed 
blanchard has credited griffiths with propelling him to victory 
in his first gubernatorial election in 1982 with her votegetting 
ability among women and senior citizens 
griffiths a 20year member of congress reacted bitterly when 
blanchard said he needed a running mate ready to step in for the 
governor at a moments notice 
blanchard 48 hinted that it was griffiths health not her age 
of 78 that convinced him to pick another running mate but he 
declined to elaborate griffiths said he had offered to keep her on 
the ticket if she would release her medical records and tax returns 
blanchard faces state senate majority leader john engler in the

the high hopes of american women and children 
in iraq for an early departure from that country have been 
frustrated by inhumane and disgraceful delays the state 
department said thursday 
at the same time president bush said he will press ahead with 
his policies irrespective of the possibility that americans held in 
iraq and kuwait might be harmed 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler assailed iraq for 
failing to issue exit visas after president saddam hussein said 
tuesday that all foreign women and children would be allowed to 
leave iraq 
but iraqi ambassador mohamed almashat said that iraq was 
working to expedite the departure of the estimated 1000 
american women and children in iraq and kuwait 
iraq has said american men will not be allowed to leave unless 
the bush administration gives assurances it will not attack iraq 
militarily 
bush said he will not allow the presence of the almost 3000 
americans in iraq and kuwait to influence his decisions on the 
persian gulf crisis 
i feel very concerned about americans held against their will 
but we cannot permit hostagetaking to shape the foreign policy of 
this country bush told a news conference 
asked whether that means the hostages are expendable bush said 
that question was too hypothetical 
he added that he believes other leaders with hostages in iraq 
and kuwait also will continue to stick by their policies 
ms tutwiler said iraqi authorities are insisting that each 
american wishing to leave submit a letter with a translation into 
arabic outlining that objective the letter must also carry a 
stamp from fiscal authorities certifying that all local taxes have 
been paid 
this emotional roller coaster is inhumane and disgraceful 
she said we hesitate to dignify these demands as exit 
procedures she said the iraqi regulations are constantly 
changing and extremely confusing 
other us officials said they are worried that iraq 
authorities during their bureaucratic inquiries may try to elicit 
from american women information on the whereabouts of their 
husbands 
iraqi troops have rounded up about 70 americans since the 
invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
but americans are continuing to escape the two countries ms 
tutwiler revised the number of americans in iraq from 500 to 400 on 
thursday the last estimate of americans in kuwait was 2500 but 
that figure is now considered obsolete because of departures over 
the past two weeks there is no estimate on the number of those who 
have escaped 
ms tutwiler said the requirements iraq has outlined are 
applicable to american women and children wishing to leave iraq and 
it is not clear whether the same procedures will be applied to 
those in kuwait 
about 25 pregnant women and 60 small children are among the 
americans eligible to return to the united states under the 
saddams new guidelines 
ambassador almashat denied reports that iraq was insisting that 
any american evacuation flights arriving in baghdad carry food and 
medicines for needy iraqis 
the envoy spoke to reporters after an hourlong meeting at the 
state department 
meanwhile 36 members of the iraqi diplomatic staff in 
washington who were ordered out of the united states by the state 
department were heading home thursday aboard a jordanian airliner 
that left new york 
they had been given until thursday afternoon to leave us 
territory the state department expelled them in retaliation for 
iraqs demand that all foreign embassies in kuwait including the 
american embassy be shut down that order has been widely ignored

excerpts from answers to questions 
ill give you a rough day every day was the same they came in 
the morning they gave you a round of arabic bread with some 
processed cheese some jam and a cup of tea and they went off and 
they came in the afternoon and they gave you a bowl of rice and 
lentils or a bowl of rice and spinach or a bowl of rice and dogs 
head soup 
some of the food in the middle period was very bad i must state 
the last nine months approximately when we were brought from 
baalbek to the southern suburbs we had excellent cuisine the room 
was very clean we were frequently asked do you want anything and 
if it was possible for them to get it they did 
like they gave us fruit every day we had meat at that period 
they would occasionally show us a video and the situation had 
very very obviously and very very markedly changed beyond that 
every day was the same 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
i dont think that i was ever in any doubt that i would get 
home or be released at some stage i never allowed myself to think 
that they were going to shoot me and if they were what was the 
point in thinking about it so i was confident i would get home 
sometime i was frightened it would be a long time i continually 
told myself and told them that you take only from me my liberty 
you dont take my freedom that you can never take 
as for my sisters i am dumbfounded i am amazed i am 
thunderstruck at the work that they have put in at the change in 
their personality at the growth they have undergone im a little 
bit afraid of them it is a wonder to me the change marked 
beautiful fantastic 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
after many days fighting with these guys who took me not 
physically i demanded to know on several occasions why i had been 
taken they seemed somewhat confused that they had an irish person 
i refused to eat for six days until they told me and they brought 
me a copy of the times covering the incidents in libya the us 
bombing and told me that was the reason and i didnt believe them 
i think they gave me the times because they were frightened i 
wasnt eating and they had to tell me something 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
i feel no desire for vengeance i feel no desire for 
retribution i dont see those as positive i dont see them as 
meaningful i think i said that those things for myself i find 
selfmaiming i dont intend maiming myself by going into a rage of 
anger i see no purpose in it 
some of those men who held us and who could speak english were 
reasonable they had some but limited knowledge of the world on 
no occasions attempted to brainwash us they did talk of their 
faith they did talk of islam they gave us a koran which we had 
for a year with no other reading material it was not an attempt to 
convert us in fact on one occasion i believe perhaps two two of 
the captors as it is obligatory in their faith asked us quite 
simply would we like to convert we simply held up our chains and 
said no chance pal 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
some most of our captors held and exemplified a great burden 
of guilt whether that is indicative and builtin to islam im no 
theologian some of them would not participate in the beatings 
left immediately some of those who did were overcome by remorse 
 
you must remember that some of these guards have very minimal 
education they have no knowledge of the outside world its not 
taught at school they watch a lot of very very violent american 
tv violence so the whole world for them is that men of 30 years 
old perhaps with a 12yearold mentality someone has stuck a 
kalashnikov in their hand well they just cant control the 
opportunity sometimes to beat very badly 
</TEXT>

the top leadership of the group never spoke to me directly they 
never spoke about themselves any questions that were put to me 
were put to me through a lieutenant so we spoke about iran quite

president bush had some fun thursday at the 
expense of his spokesman marlin fitzwater giving higher marks for 
sharp dressing to an iraqi seen often on television reading the 
words of saddam hussein 
the lighthearted moment came at an otherwiseserious white house 
news conference when a reporter quoted fitzwater as saying bush 
was pretty adamant and stubborn about vacationing in maine 
despite the mideast crisis 
i wouldnt call it adamant or stubborn the president 
answered 
the redfaced fitzwater watching the news conference from the 
wings indicated he certainly wouldnt either 
he better not have bush said to widespread laughter 
marlins going through kind of a downer though because the 
iraqi spokesman has the matching tie and hankie you know so its 
been a little difficult bush teased 
several of the iraqi presidents statements have been read on 
television by miqdad muradi a dapper anchorman on the iraqi 
staterun television network muradi is always impeccably dressed 
in a dark suit and sober tie

a federal judge on 
thursday sentenced a key witness in the trial of washington mayor 
marion barry to five years probation on drug charges 
charles lewis a former virgin islands government employee 
could have received a maximum 80year prison term on his conviction 
in april 1989 for possessing and selling crack cocaine 
instead us district judge stanley brotman sentenced lewis to 
a fiveyear probation program during which he must perform 1000 
hours of community service and undergo periodic tests for drug use 
in handing down the sentence brotman said lewis had extensively 
cooperated with the barry investigation 
lewis thanked his friends and family for their support 
im sorry for it he said of his drug conviction the past 
several months i have been penitent 
lewis 50 returned to his native st thomas on aug 3 after 
serving a 15month prison sentence in washington for a drug 
conviction there 
his washington attorney mark shaffer said that he had been 
rehabilitated and that further time in prison would serve no 
purpose 
in a memorandum filed with the court here terry halpern the 
us attorney for the virgin islands had requested leniency in 
return for lewis cooperation in the barry case 
the mayor was convicted aug 10 on a single count of cocaine 
possession a misdemeanor and acquitted on a second count the 
jury was unable to agree on 12 other counts including felony 
perjury charges 
the federal investigation of barry began after district of 
columbia police called off an attempt to make an undercover drug 
buy from lewis on finding that the mayor was in his hotel room 
during barrys sixweek trial lewis was the star witness 
testifying extensively on the mayors drug use 
the fbi and government motion indicated the defendant provided 
substantial assistance in the prosecution halpern said after 
thursdays hearing 
lewis also reportedly gave federal investigators information 
about a joint district of columbiavirgin islands personnel project 
of which he was previously codirector no charges have brought as 
a result of that investigation although lewis was fired from his 
post by gov alexander farrelly in april 1988 for alleged 
mismanagement 
lewis was arrested march 3 1989 at a st thomas hotel after 
selling crack to a female undercover fbi agent

moving the historical setting of operas around 
is a tricky task and only a few productions have survived the 
transport of time and space 
frank corsaros carmen at the new york city opera is one of 
them and the spanish civil war production that debuted in 1984 is 
being revived this season at lincoln centers new york state 
theater 
instead of putting the action in seville of the 1820s the 
singers are transported to 1936 when francisco francos fascists 
were attempting to overthrow the loyalists 
carmen is a loyalist leader instead of a gypsy and don jose is a 
fascist soldier whom she attempts to win over to the antifranco 
side escamillo the toreador is a drunk with fascist sympathies 
by giving everything political overtones the attention 
naturally is shifted from the singing to the acting and the 
production even in the best of cases this is a stretch leading 
to such absurdities as the rhinemaidens as prostitutes in the 
patrice chereau ring at bayreuth or the citicorp building in the 
background of the peter sellars figaro that was set in new 
yorks trump tower 
nevertheless the corsaro approach holds up for the most part 
its hard to watch escamillo in a sports jacket and tie looking 
somewhat like an overweight golfer but it does fit quite nicely 
into the overall scheme of things 
one does miss the spectacle of the entrance into the bullring at 
the start of the fourth act six soldiers parading back and forth 
do not quite adequately fill in the matadors and animals that are 
customary 
in wednesday nights performance sharon graham sang carmen 
originated by victoria vergara in corsaros original production 
while graham sang ably she was not able to dominate the opera as a 
top carmen should 
brian hilt made his debut with the company as don jose his 
voice was powerful but seemed to strain at times especially during 
the flower song 
dean peterson sang escamillo and michele boucher was an 
especially sweet micaela

f16 jet fighters and antitank combat 
helicopters have been sent to saudi arabia from bases in western 
europe the pentagon announced on thursday 
spokesman pete williams said the f16s from the 401st tactical 
fighter wing based at torrejon air base in spain will be 
positioned in qatar 
defense secretary dick cheney visited qatar earlier this month 
in his quest for additional persian gulf support for operation 
desert shield 
the country joins saudi arabia and the united arab emirates in 
allowing us troops to be based on their soil in response to 
iraqs invasion of kuwait 
williams said the us government was especially pleased by 
qatars decision 
the spokesman added that elements of the 12th combat aviation 
brigade and the aviation elements of the 3rd armored division were 
also deploying to saudi arabia 
both units are located in west germany and become the first army 
helicopter units from european positions to be sent to saudi arabia 
the units include ah64 apache attack helicopters uh60 black 
hawk utility helicopters oh58 kiowa reconnaisance helicopters 
ch47 chinook medium lift cargo helicopters and uh1 huey 
helicopters as well as their support personnel 
the apache is the armys chief antitank weapon and carries 
hellfire missiles to pierce enemy armor 
offering an update of the navys effort to block iraqi shipping 
williams said that some 250 ships have been intercepted 
two ships one sri lankan and one panamanian were boarded on 
wednesday but both were allowed to proceed into the gulf of 
aquaba the spokesman said 
no iraqi or kuwaiti vessels have been boarded during the effort 
he said 
williams declined to give a total number of boardings saying 
slightly more than a handful had undergone a closeup 
inspection by navy officials 
the spokesman also confirmed that the pentagons comptroller 
sean okeefe has asked the services and all departments to 
explore all options and alternatives for reducing costs in 
order to help fund desert shield 
limiting exercises minimizing purchases of supplies and cutting 
back on nonessential maintenance were suggested as belttightening 
measures 
the announcements came as officials also defended the militarys 
sealift operation which has encountered some problems in 
transporting the masses of tanks armored vehicles and heavy 
equipment to saudi arabia 
williams noted that the antares one of the eight fast sealift 
ships heading to saudi arabia has had a number of boiler 
problems was under tow by a navy tug and was being worked on by 
its engineering crew the vessel is carrying equipment for the 24th 
infantry division mechanized a unit with heavy m1 tanks 
two other ships the curtiss and the gulf banker have also had 
boiler problems that were being repaired williams said 
you would expect problems in an operation this massive but i 
would not want it to be described as something that is bogging down 
or going badly williams said 
williams contended that the pentagon has moved more equipment 
personnel and supplies in the first three weeks of this 
operation than we did in the first three months of the korean war 
we just havent done anything this massive this quickly 
before 
asked about complaints voiced privately by some army officials 
about the pace of the shipping deployment williams said 
obviously every commander whos there would like to have every 
part of his group or unit with him as soon as he gets there 
but thats not a realistic thing i dont think anyone expected 
that 
an official from the military sealift command said 19 ships have 
arrived in saudi arabia and been unloaded that two more were 
currently being unloaded and that at least ten more were en route 
to saudi arabia five more ships were being loaded on thursday the 
official added 
the official said that the process has to be a phased one since 
all ships held in the militarys socalled ready reserve fleet 
cant show up at the docks all at once 
also most of the ships are older steamdriven vessels that are 
being taken out of storage and must be crewed and made ready to 
sail the ships were purchased in the past two decades and put away 
for just such an emergency but many have never been used since 
the official said 
the command has also chartered some 20 commercial ships in order 
to meet the need for large cargo vessels eleven of those are 
foreignflagged and come from such nations as panama bahrain 
saudi arabia norway italy and britain the official said 
weve had some problems but were overcoming them the 
official said

un chief javier perez de cuellar arrived 
thursday for talks with iraqs foreign minister and said he was 
hopeful iraq is ready to discuss ways to ease tension and solve the 
crisis caused by its invasion of kuwait 
i believe that the government of iraq is as eager as we all 
are to find a just and lasting solution of the problem which is an 
explosive one i cant understand anyone in the world prepared to 
sacrifice human lives he said 
the un secretarygeneral and iraqs tariq aziz will hold talks 
in amman friday 
the secretarygeneral said his mission was to get iraq to comply 
with security concil resolutions demanding unconditional withdrawal 
of iraqi troops from kuwait and restoration of the government 
ousted by the aug 2 invasion 
these are not my resolutions they are security council 
resolutions i cannot make any concessions on these he stressed 
i am not a merchant to negotiate i came here to discuss ways 
and means of finding a solution to the problem 
i am hopeful that the iraqi authorities have accepted my 
invitation because they are prepared to discuss with me ways and 
means of lessening tension and solving the problem 
perez de cuellar told a crowded news conference that he invited 
aziz to meet and their talks would be within the framework of the 
security council resolutions 
the council has also voted to adopt and enforce an international 
trade embargo against iraq 
perez de cuellar replied it is a good step when asked to 
comment on an iraqi announcement tuesday it would allow foreign 
women and chldren among the hostages to leave the country 
the expected exodus had not materialized as of thursday 
foreign minister marwan qassem of jordan greeted the 
secretarygeneral at ammans civil airport 
their motorcade drove past dozens of parked buses that brought 
hundreds of egyptians who fled iraq and kuwait to avoid becoming 
engulfed in a possible war many egyptians were sprawled in long 
lines on the ground by the airport entrance waiting to join 
special flights taking them home 
the issue of foreigners trapped by the crisis is expected to be 
high on the agenda at the talks between perez de cuellar and aziz 
the un chief is staying at the royal palace as guest of crown 
prince hassan who is acting as regent in the absence of king 
hussein 
asked if he would fly to baghdad to confer with iraqi president 
saddam hussein perez de cuellar said i am not seeking to see 
anyone 
more than 100 news media representatives were at the 10minute 
news conference 
the secretarygeneral joshed with reporters as they yelled 
questions at him 
if you come and see me in private ill tell you he replied 
smiling when a reporter asked him if he had a secret formula to 
propose to aziz 
during his brief stopover in paris on his way to amman from new 
york he said he sought a meeting with aziz because he could not 
remain indifferent 
the situation is very tense and difficult human lives risk 
being lost he said 
he said however his mission came out i will have for me for 
my own conscience a sort of satisfaction you did your best

on the eve of solidaritys 10th 
anniversary prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki returned to its 
birthplace thursday to plead for backing from workers disillusioned 
with the leaders they helped put in power 
at a separate news conference the unions founder lech walesa 
directed harsh criticism at mazowieckis solidarityled government 
walesa said the yearold noncommunist government has been too slow 
in democratizing polands parliament 
poland put itself at the vanguard of eastern europes democratic 
revolution when it installed the regions first noncommunist 
government a year ago however since then that government has 
fallen afoul of solidarity chairman walesa and other critics who 
say it should move faster to jettison the remaining trappings of 
four decades of communist rule 
mazowiecki who came to the gdansk shipyard thursday with five 
of his ministers was asked during the 3hour meeting to explain 
why his government has not moved faster to create a freemarket 
economy and dismiss communist holdovers from government and 
managerial positions 
walesa was absent from the meeting hall at the northern port he 
said earlier he did not want to detract from the prime ministers 
appearance 
it was in the same hall that walesa with mazowiecki then an 
adviser at his side signed the historic accord with the 
communist government on aug 31 1980 to give birth to eastern 
europes first independent workers movement 
at his news conference thursday the chairman of the 10yearold 
union declared he is still fighting for fulfillment of the 1980 
strikes 21 demands walesa said that means bringing poland to full 
democracy by free parliamentary and presidential elections 
walesa also accused the mazowiecki government which he helped 
create of moving too slowly to replace the present parliament 
where 65 percent of the seats were reserved for the subsequently 
dissolved communist party or its allies he also said the 
arrangement under which former communist first secretary wojciech 
jaruzelski is serving as president is outdated 
the solidarity chairman has been waging an unannounced campaign 
for the presidency 
without mentioning walesa by name mazowiecki replied to the 
accusation this government has not been is not and will not 
hinder political changes we have been speeding up not by 
arguing but by acting 
mazowiecki skirted the issue of whether he would be a candidate 
for president opposing walesa 
i will answer this question when the problem is put forward 
formally when the right time comes but i think society should 
have the right to choose between candidates he said 
after meeting workers mazowiecki walked through the spawling 
shipyard also the site of strikes in 1988 he then went on to st 
brygidas the roman catholic church that served as a sanctuary for 
solidarity during its eight years under a ban that followed martial 
law in december 1981 
in the year since the solidarityled government ended communist 
rule it has launched a painful shock reform program to restore 
capitalism dissolved the secret police and made many other changes 
mazowiecki and his ministers all longtime solidarity 
supporters listened to complaints from baltic solidarity leaders 
and rankandfile workers who packed the hall outside several 
hundred more people listened over loudspeakers 
complaints ranged from gasoline prices to lack of change in 
local governments but they concentrated on lingering bureaucracy 
they blame for harming the shipyard industry and the continued 
presence of the old communist elite in privileged positions 
there are big ministries where people from the former 
government are still muddling around doing nothing said wieslaw 
wodyk union leader at the gydnia port will the poor remain poor 
and those rich people become even richer 
in vatican city the vatican newspaper thursday paid homage to 
solidaritys 10th anniversary with a plea for unity within its 
ranks 
the frontpage editorial of losservatore romano recalled the 
role of solidarity in the 1980s in forcing the collapse of 
communism in poland 
were talking about renewing the spirit of solidarity by all 
those who sincerely have the common good at heart said a

infant mortality in the united states inched 
down last year to the lowest level ever recorded but the us rate 
is still higher than many industrialized nations officials said 
thursday 
although weve made progress in reducing this nations infant 
mortality we must do better said louis sullivan secretary of 
the health and human services department 
the provisional data released by the national center for health 
statistics would rank the united states below 21 industrialized 
countries on a list comparing 1986 rates said center spokeswoman 
sandra smith 
the ranking is probably still accurate she said 
we make progress but so do other countries she said 
the new data shows that us infant deaths for 1989 were 97 per 
1000 live births down from 99 per 1000 
the 1989 data for infant mortality was not broken down for 
blacks and whites but final data from 1987 shows that while white 
infant deaths amounted to 86 per 1000 the rate for blacks was 
179 
sullivan said the united states must continue to direct 
prevention education and health care opportunities to our minority 
and poor citizens where infant mortality strikes hardest 
racial disparity was also evident in other health factors 
including life expectancy at birth the 1989 data shows it 
increased half a year for white males but only a tenth of a year 
for black males 
for the entire us population life expectancy at birth was a 
record high of 752 years up from 749 years in 1988 
the new data also shows that aids moved from the 15th to the 
11th leading cause of death the estimated 21360 aids deaths last 
year was 32 percent higher than the 16210 deaths from the disease 
in 1988 the report said 
dr james mason assistant secretary for health credited 
healthier choices many americans are making for lower 
ageadjusted death rates for heart disease and stroke and the 
higher life expectancy 
those choices he said include quitting smoking watching their 
diets and getting more exercise

romania has been particularly hard hit by its 
support for sanctions against iraq and needs credits and other 
economic help from the united states and other countries 
ambassador virgil constantinescu said thursday 
in return constantinescu said romania might be able to produce 
fuel for us jet fighters based in saudi arabia 
we are badly affected he told reporters but the 
decisions were right and have to be carried out 
the ambassador was explaining his countrys plight at the 
embassy shortly before president bush said at a news conference 
that his aides were developing a strategy to help the countries 
hardest hit by the sanctions 
a state department official who spoke on condition of not being 
identified said the details of the plan were yet to be formulated 
and it was unknown how much romania would be included in the 
assistance 
the united states angered by romanian suppression of dissidents 
and demonstrators last june has suspended nonhumanitarian aid to 
the country and has refused to grant it favored trade status 
ambassador constantinescu said romania was still in the process 
of moving away from the communism practiced under overthrown 
president nicolae ceausescu 
nonetheless he said romania has enacted the legal framework 
for free elections on a par with other emerging democracies in 
eastern europe and those countries have been granted favored trade 
status 
because of the sanctions iraq has halted repayment to romania 
on a debt of 17 billion dollars constantinescu said since the 
payment was being made in the form of crude oil romania is having 
to cut back production in its oil refineries by 25 percent 
romania also had a number of joint ventures with iraq that are 
having to be curtailed he said iraq was romanias main trading 
partner in the developing world and its eighthranking trading 
partner overall 
constantinescu said romania was suffering from an unjustifiably 
bad image in the capital markets around the world 
nobody is ready to give money to romania he said

an administrative judge has ordered 
immigration authorities to deport members of a salvadoran family to 
a third country rather than return them to their strifetorn nation 
the ruling was hailed thursday by a refugee advocacy lawyer as 
an important step toward changing the governments policy of 
forcing aliens to return to homelands beset by civil war if they 
cant prove they are likely to be harmed 
what this decision stands for is an articulated justification 
under international law for a generic approach for providing 
protection to those who otherwise would be returned to a civil 
war arthur c helton director of the refugee project for the 
lawyers committee for human rights said about the aug 24 decision 
helton estimated there are as many as 500000 salvadorans living 
in this country the ins last year granted 337 applications for 
asylum status while denying 13861 
its a promising decision and if upheld on appeal would have a 
substantial impact on us practice helton said but he conceded 
that the decision is based on international law rather than federal 
immigration law 
helton noted that an attempt by an immigration judge several 
years ago to invoke an international treaty to stop the deportation 
of salvadorans was overturned on appeal 
ins authorities are confident that the decision by immigration 
judge paul a nejelski would be overturned by the board of 
immigration appeals said an official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the decision does not set a precedent for other cases of 
salvadorans or any other aliens seeking refugee status it only 
applies to the threemember salvadoran family residing in the 
virginia suburbs of washington 
the judge rejected the family members claims that they were 
likely to be persecuted upon returning to el salvador but said that 
under customary international law they have a right not to be 
deported to el salvador as long as the current civil war 
continues 
helton said that even if the decision is overturned on appeal 
it could contribute to the debate in congress over a longstanding 
proposal to provide safe haven for people fleeing civil strife in 
their homelands 
ins grants extended voluntary departure status to selected 
nationalities most recently chinese and afghans who have fled 
civil war in their homelands but helton said some members of 
congress have pressed for a generic safehaven program that would 
apply whenever an alien flees civil war 
in the law of nations the practice is not to return 
individuals to situations of civil strife helton said that is 
something that as a matter of policy the executive branch or the 
congress could take heed and implement

the two germanys pledged thursday to 
nearly halve the troop strengths of a united germany 
the commitment made in a rare open plenary session of eastwest 
talks on reducing conventional forces in europe formalized an 
agreement by west german chancellor helmut kohl and soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev in the soviet union in july 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher said his 
government commits itself to reduce the personnel strength of the 
armed forces of the united germany to 370000 within three to four 
years 
genscher was joined in his presentation at the negotiations by 
east german premier lothar de maziere 
de maziere said his government was in full agreement with 
genscher he said the armed forces of a united germany would be 
slightly more than half of the current total of more than 600000 
he said the number of tanks and other weapons systems would also be 
reduced by about 50 percent 
also thursday the two germanys agreed on measures to guard 
against potential blackmailers gaining access to sensitive 
documents compiled by east germanys secret police 
the issue had threatened to block a proposed treaty laying the 
legal foundations of german unity 
kohls government said both germanys would sign the unification 
treaty friday in west berlin clearing the way for formal 
unification on oct 3 
however officials from the two germanys and west german 
opposition leaders were holding meetings in bonn trying to resolve 
their differences on the draft treaty 
another obstacle to full political agreement on the treaty 
abortion rights in a united germany has not yet been resolved 
the secret police compiled files on the private lives of 
millions of east germans to help the former communist government 
maintain its iron grip on the nation 
angry east german lawmakers in east berlin threatened to veto 
the treaty if 6 million secret police files were sent to a west 
german government archive in koblenz as was initially foreseen in 
the treaty 
interior minister wolfgang schaeuble and east germanys top 
unity negotiator guenther krause agreed an allgerman parliament 
should decide how to keep the documents in safety said schaeubles 
spokesman roland bachmeier 
approval of the unification treaty is not essential for 
unification but leaders of both nations have said it is imperative 
that they negotiate a treaty and not simply allow west german law 
to take effect automatically in east germany 
on the weapons statements the chief soviet delegate at the 
vienna talks oleg a grinevsky told reporters they are an 
encouraging sign of interest in the vienna talks not only on the 
part of the governments of the two german states but also in the 
future of a united germany 
representatives of the 16 nato and seven warsaw pact countries 
are trying to finish a treaty on reducing numbers of troops tanks 
and armaments in europe in time to be signed at a summit of 35 
nations in paris on nov 19 
genscher said two unresolved problems still need to be 
addressed he said these were the limitation of aircraft and the 
socalled sufficiency rule which would limit the number of troops 
and armaments each country could have within the overall 
restrictions for each side 
grinevsky proposed a collective ceiling for each side in central 
europe be set at 40004500 tanks up to 6000 armored combat 
vehicles and 3500 artillery pieces the two sides have agreed to 
an overall ceiling of 20000 tanks for each

a lawyer for a comatose woman asked a 
state court thursday to allow removal of her life support system 
citing new evidence that she wouldnt want to continue living in 
her condition 
the petition filed with jasper county probate judge charles teel 
said three witnesses have come forth who had specific discussions 
with nancy cruzan regarding her wishes about lifesustaining 
medical treatment 
in july the us supreme court barred the removal of ms 
cruzans lifesustaining feeding tube in its first ruling in a 
righttodie case 
the nations highest court said a states interest in preserving 
life may overcome the wishes of family members seeking to end the 
life of a patient in an irreversible comalike condition 
her parents joe and joyce cruzan of carterville in southwest 
missouri fought to have a surgically implanted tube removed from 
their 33yearold daughter 
ms cruzan has been in a persistent vegetative state since a 
january 1983 car crash and is kept alive at the missouri 
rehabilitation center in mount vernon 
in an interview from his carterville home joe cruzan said he 
was about as optimistic as i can allow myself to be given the 
pace of the legal system 
i dont know where its going to end i hope were successful 
i gave up being enthusiastic a long time ago when i learned the 
legal system doesnt work very fast he said 
in the petition attorney bill colby of kansas city noted that 
the supreme court ruled the discovery of new evidence regarding 
the patients intent could allow for modification or reversal of 
the ban on removing her feeding tube 
the petition said the court ruled that missouri can require 
clear and convincing evidence as a legal standard of proof of 
ms cruzans wishes before medical treatment is terminated 
colby declined in an interview to reveal the identities of the 
three people other than to say two were people ms cruzan had 
worked for and the third was a coworker 
missouri attorney general william webster who handled the 
states challenges to the cruzan family had no immediate comment 
on the filing said his spokeswoman mary jenkins

because he opposes us involvement in the persian gulf crisis 
cpl jeffrey paterson 22 refused to leave with members of his 
unit part of the 1st marine expeditionary brigade when it was 
deployed to saudi arabia on wednesday said staff sgt christopher 
grey a public affairs officer at kaneohe marine corps air station 
no charges have been filed against paterson grey said he was 
confined to his barracks area and could face charges of disobeying 
lawful orders and missing movement he said 
eric seitz attorney for paterson said he was unable to contact 
his client thursday he charged marine officials with unlawfully 
restricting access to paterson and said military officials were 
deliberately going out of their way to precipitate a 
confrontation 
paterson of hollister calif filed for conscientious objector 
status aug 17 citing his opposition to us interventionist 
policy in the middle east 
he has been on a hunger strike since aug 24 to draw attention

seitz said he expects the request to be denied and will seek an

a federal appeals court on thursday 
overturned wayne newtons record 52 million libel judgment and 
dismissed his lawsuit over an nbc broadcast that suggested ties to 
the mob 
a jury in las vegas found that the television networks october 
1980 story created a false impression that the mafia had helped the 
singer buy the aladdin hotelcasino in exchange for a hidden share 
and that newton had deceived nevada gaming officials 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals did not say whether the 
story as a whole was false but said any false impressions were not 
the result of the kind of journalistic misconduct required for 
libel suits by public figures 
under us supreme court standards public figures must prove 
that defamatory statements were either deliberate falsehoods or 
reckless made in disregard of the truth the court said the 
evidence failed to support the jurys finding that the nbc 
broadcast met that standard 
the 30 ruling said most of the broadcasts factual statements 
were true newton had a friend with purported mob ties who had done 
him a favor and had then talked with an associate about the 
possibility of profiting from newtons ownership of the aladdin a 
federal grand jury had investigated that subject and newton had 
testified falsely to the nevada gaming board 
although the broadcast did not specify the favor that had been 
done for newton according to newton getting a criminal 
organization to stop threatening him and his daughter the court 
said the omission was not libelous the reporters had reason to 
doubt the story of the threats which had been denied by newtons 
lawyer in newtons presence the court said 
the jury awarded newton 193 million us district judge myron 
crocker reduced the damages to 52 million mostly in punitive 
damages after finding that newtons income and reputation had not 
suffered it was still the largest libel judgment up to that time 
among the reasons nbc gave for challenging the verdict was 
crockers refusal to transfer the trial out of las vegas where an 
annual wayne newton day is celebrated and a street is named after 
him 
the court did not rule on that issue but said the location of 
the trial was a reason to scrutinize the jury verdict closely 
wayne newtons case poses the danger that first amendment 
values will be subverted by a local jury biased in favor of a 
prominent local public figure against an alien speaker who 
criticizes that local hero said the opinion by judge william 
norris 
i dont think this decision would have been rendered any place 
in the country other than in las vegas floyd abrams a prominent 
libel lawyer representing nbc said thursday i dont think the 
jury was as much biased against nbc as it was prone to support 
wayne newton 
nbc news president michael gartner called the ruling a sound 
victory for investigative journalism 
newtons lawyer morton galane said he would not comment until 
he could reach newton

more than 200 women and children who had 
been held hostage at strategic iraqi sites were taken to a baghdad 
hotel thursday in preparation for leaving iraq 
no exit visas were expected before saturday because friday is 
the moslem sabbath and government offices are closed 
iraqi officials denied reports that the hostages were being 
detained in exchange for food and medicine to ease effects from the 
un embargo of iraq 
the united nations imposed sanctions to force iraq to withdraw 
from kuwait and the united states has led a multinational force 
buildup in saudi arabia aimed at discouraging any move by iraq to 
seize any more territory 
president bush told a news conference in washington thursday he 
will not allow the presence of the roughly 3000 americans in iraq 
and kuwait to influence his decisions on the persian gulf crisis

children guests asked for exit visas to leave the country they 
said 28 asked to remain 
the foreigners included 68 japanese but breakdowns of other 
nationalities were not available it was not clear how many of the 
estimated 21000 westerners stranded since iraq invaded kuwait aug

the time of the 2 invasion her british airways flight was not 
allowed to continue the journey 
iraqi president saddam hussein said this week that women and 
children held along with western men to shield his country from 
attack would be allowed to travel beginning wednesday 
diplomats in baghdad speaking on condition of anonymity said 
thursday the government has refused to allow foreign airlines to 
land in the iraqi capital to evacuate western women and children 
unless they carry food and medicines 
otherwise the evacuees would have to travel in convoys 
overland most likely to the turkish border 375 miles north of 
baghdad they said 
iraqs ambassador in washington mohamed almashat told 
reporters there thursday it is absolutely not true i 
categorically deny that 
officials in baghdad also denied the reports

private school in kuwait told reporters she was caught in a 
roundup by iraqi soldiers two weeks after the invasion as she and 
other australians searched for food in kuwait city

or by bus iraqi officials said that would be decided when their 
exit visas are granted 
karen taylor said she was held with other britons at a site 300 
miles from baghdad 
we were treated well but some children were sick and were 
treated by iraqi doctors she said we were given what we

of iraqi president saddam hussein were arrested in kuwait after his 
aug 2 invasion

arbitrary detention and disappearances and over iraqs treatment

iraq was arranging thursday to evacuate some 
british women and children from baghdad aboard iraqi airways the 
foreign office said and virgin atlantic airways said it had iraqi 
permission to pick up more evacuees 
virgin atlantic said that contrary to reports from diplomats in 
iraq it was not told to bring food and supplies to baghdad before 
it could evacuate britons 
the foreign office said iraq was arranging to fly britons 
possibly 132 women and children direct to london but no time or 
date had been specified 
the department spokesman said exit visas for this flight are 
being arranged but he added no exit visas have been issued 
for any subsequent flights 
an estimated 4500 britons were caught in iraq and kuwait when 
iraq invaded its oilrich neighbor aug 2 about 3000 americans 
were among the estimated 21000 westerners trapped in iraq and 
iraqioccupied kuwait 
it was not clear how many of the westerners will be allowed to 
travel 
british airways was standing by to remove up to five aircraft 
from scheduled services to help with any airlift from iraq 
virgin atlantics chairman richard branson said iraqi 
authorities approved his airlines plans to fly to baghdad on 
friday to evacuate at least 140 women and children 
he originally set the departure for 2 am but later said the 
foreign office has asked that we are ready to leave later 
tomorrow 
he said the permission that virgin atlantic has from the iraqis 
lasts 24 hours he said he was confident the iraqis would abide by 
the agreed plan 
the impression we have having talked to various iraqi 
ambassadors is that saddam hussein is very serious about letting 
women and children go 
he wants to make a gesture and we believe he wont want to 
spoil the gesture by doing anything foolish he said 
the boeing 747 planned for the flight could carry up to 350 
passengers 
asked about reports that iraq would insist any foreign planes 
landing in baghdad for the evacuation bring food and supplies 
virgin atlantic spokesman will whitehorn said he never heard a word 
about that from either side 
the iraqi embassy in london denied the reports conveyed by 
diplomats in baghdad who spoke on condition of anonymity 
saddam the iraqi president said this week that women and 
children interned along with western men to shield iraq from attack 
will be allowed to leave 
earlier thursday the government said 32 more british citizens 
had been rounded up in kuwait while its embassy in baghdad has 
begun handling paperwork to send women and children home 
a foreign office spokesman said some passports had been 
collected in baghdad but the advice to british nationals still in 
kuwait remained that they should keep a low profile 
the situation in kuwait is rather complicated by the fact that 
it is impossible for people to come to us and hand in their 
passports the spokesman said 
he said 197 british citizens were known to have been taken into 
custody in kuwait 
the british ambassador in kuwait harold walker was still 
seeking details from iraqs foreign ministry on how the evacuation 
would be organized said a spokesman who briefed reporters on 
condition of anonymity 
foreign secretary douglas hurd told bbc radio he doubted saddam 
could hold on to power if he complied with un resolutions 
demanding a withdrawal from kuwait but he said he believed a 
reasonable chance existed that economic sanctions would achieve 
un objectives without resort to force

president bush called on wealthy allies 
thursday to share the huge expense of americas military buildup in 
the persian gulf declaring that a new world order could emerge 
from the middle east crisis 
anyone with a stake in international order has an interest in 
ensuring that all of us succeed the president said 
bush at a news conference dominated by questions on the gulf 
situation was asked if he might hold back on possible military 
action for fear of harming some of the thousands of hostages held 
by iraqs saddam hussein 
he said he was concerned about them but that their fate could 
not be allowed to shape the foreign policy of this country 
the president said im not optimistic about chances for a 
diplomatic settlement with iraq however he said the situation in 
the persian gulf now appeared relatively stable 
bush met with reporters at the white house before returning to 
maine for the last five days of a 3 week vacation clouded and 
several times interrupted by tensions over iraqs invasion of 
kuwait and its threat to the oil fields of saudi arabia the 
president said he was not bothered by criticism that he was golfing 
and fishing while american troops went overseas toward a possible 
war 
roughly 60000 us combat troops have moved to battle stations 
in the gulf in the past three weeks and their number is expected to 
reach 100000 soon the pentagon estimates the deployment is 
costing 1 billion a month 
it is important that the considerable burden of the effort be 
shared by those being defended and those who benefit from the free 
flow of oil bush said 
he singled out japan west germany kuwait saudi arabia the 
united arab emirates and south korea as nations that would be asked 
for contributions 
early thursday evening presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said bush talked by telephone with west german chancellor helmut 
kohl egyptian president hosni mubarak united arab emirates 
president sheik zayed bin sultan alnahyan turkish president 
turgut ozal and the kuwaiti emir jaber alahmed alsabah to 
discuss his proposed aid program 
fitzwater said bush discussed the needs some countries have 
what kind of resources will be provided 
bush said money was needed to help defray military costs and to 
assist nations suffering from the united nations embargo against 
iraq he cited turkey and egypt as well as jordan which has 
absorbed tens of thousands of refugees from iraq and nations of 
eastern europe 
the president declined to say how much money he wanted to raise 
administration officials speaking privately said bush wanted 
about 12 billion in the first year to cover military costs 
clearly it will have some budget implications bush said of 
us costs adding i dont feel the answer is a war tax at 
home 
bush said the stakes in the gulf were truly significant the 
dependability of americas commitments to its friends and allies 
the shape of the postpostwar world opposition to aggression the 
potential domination of the energy resources that are crucial to 
the entire world 
the crisis has resulted in an unprecedented display of 
ussoviet cooperation in dealing with a major trouble spot 
moreover it has triggered a rare occasion of the five permanent 
members of the un security council acting in concert trying to 
keep the peace 
as i look at the countries that are chipping in here now 
bush said i think we do have a chance at a new world order and 
id like to think that out of this dreary performance by saddam 
hussein there could be an opportunity for peace all through the 
middle east 
bush said he was sending secretary of state james a baker iii 
and treasury secretary nicholas brady to the persian gulf europe 
and asia he said nations would be asked to join us in making 
available financial and where appropriate energy resources to 
countries that have been most affected 
money will be sought in accordance with an economic assistance 
plan drafted by the national security council and approved by bush 
the president said that international funding of the american 
force would not make the us troops mercenaries 
theres ways that burden sharing can be accomplished without 
making the forces look like mercenaries he said 
bush said he was not upset that saddam has been able to express 
his views on american television but the president said hed like 
the same opportunity on iraqi television 
saddams televised appearances with foreign hostages havent 
helped him very much with world opinion bush said he 
characterized the appearances as so brutal and so totally 
unacceptable that it worked against him manipulative cynical 
bush stopped short of saying his goal was ousting saddam from 
power but he said it wouldnt disappoint me if the iraqis got 
up and said look this man is our problem 
the president also said he was pleased with opecs decision to 
take up the slack in oil production created by the trade 
embargo against iraq the oilproducing nations on wednesday 
ratified an increase in production prompting a drop in oil prices 
to the lowest point in nearly three weeks 
bush would not confirm directly that his administration is 
supporting the kuwaiti underground resistance however he said 
in a broad way i support the kuwaiti underground i support 
anybody who can have a hand in restoring legitimacy there to kuwait 
and to getting the iraqis out of kuwait 
asked whether the trade embargo hurts the iraqi people most 
bush said he had no fight with that nations people but theres 
nothing thats painless when you get into a situation like this 
bush also said hes not interested in saddams suggestion for a 
debate with bush and british prime minister margaret thatcher 
they can put an empty chair there as far as im concerned he 
said

the secret police compiled files on the private lives of 
millions of east germans to help the former communist government

german government archive in koblenz as was initially foreseen in 
the treaty 
schaeuble and east germanys top unity negotiator guenther

reduced by about 50 percent

a federal judge awarded 56 million to the 
family of a man and two teenagers who were killed when an 
aeromexico jetliner crashed into their cerritos house in 1986 an 
attorney said thursday 
the award wednesday by us district judge david v kenyon was 
the first judgment involving victims of the disaster who were 
killed on the ground said joseph cook the familys attorney 
eightytwo people including 15 on the ground died when the 
aeromexico dc9 collided with a small plane and smashed into a 
residential neighborhood aug 31 1986 it was the worst air 
disaster in los angelesarea history 
frank estrada sr 43 his son javier 16 and daughter 
angelica 14 were killed inside their home another teenager 
inside the house survived 
a jury in 1989 divided blame for the crash equally between the 
united states and the pilot of the small plane the jurors found an 
air traffic controller failed to warn the pilots they were on a 
collision course 
the family widow theresa estrada and two children will receive 
28 million to 3 million because money already received in a 
settlement with aeromexico will be deducted cook said 
justice department spokesman michael w robinson said the 
government was weighing an appeal of the award we are reviewing 
our options he said 
aeromexico flight 498 was approaching los angeles international 
airport when it collided with a singleengine piper archer plane 
piloted by william kramer of rancho palos verdes 
mrs estrada was returning from the market when the crash 
occurred she arrived to find her home in ruins 
kenyon ruled last year that the government and kramers estate 
must repay aeromexico for payments to the families of passengers 
killed in the crash

president mikhail s gorbachev said thursday he 
welcomes the adoption of sovereignty declarations by soviet 
republics calling them a major achievement of his perestroika 
reform program 
gorbachev appeared to distinguish however between declarations 
of sovereignty which entail greater autonomy within the soviet 
union and declarations of independence which call for seceding 
from the country 
thirteen of the soviet unions 15 constituent republics have 
made some moves toward greater autonomy 
eight have declared sovereignty or the right to overturn soviet 
laws on their territory they are russia the largest repubic the 
ukraine azerbaijan byelorussia moldavia uzbekistan 
tadzhikistan and turkmenia 
five have moved toward independence but only one lithuania 
has declared itself immediately independent of the soviet union 
gorbachev has condemned the lithuanian action as a violation of 
the soviet constitution and he imposed a punishing economic 
embargo against the republic following the march 11 decaration the 
embargo was later lifted in return for lithuanias agreement to 
suspend the declaration pending negotiations 
the other four republics that have declared independence 
latvia estonia georgia and armenia have said they hope to break 
free of the soviet union in the future after transition periods or 
negotiations 
gorbachev spoke thursday at a joint meeting of his presidential 
council and the federation council which comprises the presidents 
of all the republics 
the soviet press agency tass quoted him as saying that the 
sovereignty declarations are a major achievement of perestroika 
and a serious prerequisite for a union of sovereign states 
cooperation and friendship of soviet peoples 
gorbachev has been pushing for a new treaty between all the 
republics that will preserve the soviet union but he has been 
faced by nationalist demonstrations and violence in several 
regions including armenia azerbaijan and georgia 
he warned that the moves toward sovereignty are sometimes 
accompanied by destructive actions that hurt the economy and he 
appealed for peace 
we describe with reason perestroika as a revolution but 
this is a peaceful revolution which is being conducted within the 
framework of law and through a chain of farreaching structural 
reforms he said 
the greatest achievement of perestroika is that in such a vast 
country with a complicated history and presentday problems these 
transformations on the whole are proceeding within the framework 
of peacefu reforms and this should be preserved 
perestroika is the term used for gorbachevs restructuring of 
soviet society and opening of its centrally planned econony to some 
market forces

biology teacher stephen hunt died when a 
tornado grabbed a truck in front of plainfield high school and 
dropped it onto the second floor of the science department where 
he worked 
only rooms away business teacher linda kinnikin survived 
unscathed 
behind the school which was demolished the twister leveled 
shirley and gene fassiottos home plucking their car from a now 
nonexistent garage and depositing it upside down where the living 
room once stood 
across the street lois moffitts brick ranchstyle house still 
stands 
the capriciousness of the tornadoes that spun across northern 
illinois on tuesday is painfully obvious to the survivors of the 
storms 
they say tornadoes touch down and jump all over the place 
mrs kinnikin said shaking her head wednesday as she examined the 
rubble that killed her colleague 
in a matter of a minutes time it all changed she said 
the death toll climbed to 27 thursday when a 3yearold girl and 
16yearold boy died of injuries they suffered in the storms more 
than 300 people were injured 
hunt had been talking with mrs kinnikin only a few minutes 
before the tornado hit 
he was a dedicated teacher mrs kinnikin said softly her 
eyes brimming with tears 
asked how she survived she shook her head 
i heard so much debris hitting the windows of the building 
she recalled there was no visibility because the rain was coming 
down so hard 
and when the window blew i took off running for the mens 
bathroom my department chair and i huddled together in the mens 
bathroom i said oh my god three times and it was over 
when she climbed out of the rubble she saw the walls in ruins 
the roof blown off and smashed cars in the parking lot thrown into 
a heap 
at least two dozen people died in the tornadoes that hit joliet 
crest hill and plainfield about 35 miles southwest of chicago 
the twisters left more than 1000 homes uninhabitable and caused 
over 100 million in damage the region has been declared a state 
and federal disaster area 
and the random misfortunes didnt necessarily stop when the 
storms left on thursday a truck serving as a mobile kitchen for 
relief workers exploded and caught fire in joliet injuring four 
people one critically 
authorities said a propane tank overflowed while being loaded 
and the fuel was ignited by a flame from a stove 
three people died on the plainfield school grounds during the 
storm including hunt 
bruch reed 15 said hunt had like been like a second father to 
him 
ive done so much thinking about the people who died said 
reed who was at a park a few blocks away when the storm hit and 
who was unhurt 
i suppose we should feel guilty not just because i 
survived but because my house was untouched reed said 
you always think it doesnt happen and wont happen to you 
he said it doesnt matter who you are or where you are it can 
happen 
shirley fassiotto knows her home was reduced to boards bricks 
and plaster strewn about the lot 
we had just gotten to the basement when the walls came down 
she said 
glancing across the street at mrs moffitts home she added 
you wonder she just missed the path of the twister who 
knows how 
it doesnt matter what kind of house you have or where youre 
situated the path is so erratic said mrs moffitt who was 
visiting a daughter in joliet when the storm hit windows in her 
home were shattered and the roof was slightly damaged 
across the street and down a few houses don erikson 60 was 
less lucky he was looking out his living room picture window when 
the storm hit 
the tornado drove chunks of glass into his body and threw him 
onto the couch it also tossed his furniture around like toys and 
blew off the roof but left several paper cups sitting on a 
counter 
erikson was in fair condition thursday at a joliet hospital 
he lost a lot of blood said his son jeff erikson 30

leave beginning wednesday but state department spokeswoman

americans who have been barred from leaving iraq and kuwait are 
women or children age 18 and under the americans are among about 
21000 westerners trapped since iraq took over kuwait

been a slight easing of tensions in the region i believe that 
weve halted this very dangerous rapid escalation i hope

threat

high in addition to troops on the ground 27 american warships are 
patrolling the persian gulf the arabian sea and the red sea

least 10 in the gulf and red sea in the two weeks since bush

us military presence will radicalize the region and endanger 
the existing arab political order

israel

attorneys for the families of two youths who 
attempted suicide after listening to the rock band judas priest 
said thursday they would challenge a judges ruling that absolved 
the group of responsibility 
attorney vivian lynch said she would file posttrial motions to 
challenge the courts decision these usually arent granted and 
if not i will appeal to the nevada supreme court she said 
ms lynch said she believes washoe district judge jerry carr 
whitehead who heard the case without a jury put too much of a 
burden of proof on the plaintiffs and too little on lawyers for the 
band and cbs records 
the families of raymond belknap and james vance claimed that 
subliminal messages on the 1978 album stained class drove the 
youths to shoot themselves with shotguns two days before christmas 
1985 
belknap 18 died immediately and vance then 20 severely 
damaged himself and died three painful years later 
whitehead wrote that while subliminal messages did exist on the 
album they were not intentional but a chance combination of 
sounds and did not prompt the suicide pact 
ms lynch who represented vances family said the suit was a 
products liability case and the judge should not have placed a 
legal burden on the plaintiffs to prove that the hidden words were 
meant to encourage suicide 
ms lynch said enough evidence was presented that subliminal 
messages can affect behavior whitehead said he did not feel 
scientific proof of the effect of subliminals had been offered by 
the plaintiffs expert witnesses 
ms lynch said the motions by her and ken mckenna the attorney 
for belknaps family would be filed by tuesday 
attorney suellen fulstone who represented the band and cbs 
records said she would comment on the motions once she had seen 
them

tariq aziz in its editions friday extracts were made available to 
news agencies on thursday 
we say acts of terrorism are proscribed but the arab 
people are threatened with genocide aziz was quoted as saying 
if you use imperialist methods if you threaten iraq with your 
ships and planes then i am free of any moral obligations regarding 
the french american or british governments 
us french and british warships are helping enforce a un 
embargo against iraq and occupied kuwait 
france meanwhile stepped up security at its international 
airports because of the persian gulf crisis and placed the 1700 
iraqis living on french territory under police surveillance 
restricting the movement of 26 of them 
the interior ministry said the 26 iraqis in france for military 
training or with access to national defense secrets were placed 
under special surveillance in four different regions among the 
26 were four iraqi pilots caught last week trying to flee france 
part of a 12man group of air force officers studying languages and

a navy reservist says he was fired after his 
first day as an insurance agent because his boss feared he would be 
called into active duty 
he was more concerned about his company than he was about the 
guys who are willing to serve and maybe even willing to die for 
their country said mark j kershner 27 a hospital corpsman 
attached to the 4th marine medical unit at the naval air station 
atlanta 
his boss state farm insurance agent ron greene told him to go 
home monday after one day on the job kershner said tuesday he 
charged that greene did not want to waste time training him 
its really a terrible situation greene said i have a 
lot of respect for the military and the reserves he would not 
elaborate 
drew hamilton deputy regional vice president for state farm 
said wednesday that greene is an independent contractor who sells 
state farm insurance this agent is not an employee of state 
farm he said 
state farm is in absolute compliance with the law and we 
support it 
firing a reservist is a violation of a federal law that covers 
veterans employment rights according to the national committee 
for employer support of the guard and reserve 
you cant fire someone for being a reservist said houston 
weaver a volunteer with georgias employer support committee who 
investigated kershners complaint and passed his findings on to the 
state labor department 
kershners unit has not been activated and is not on alert 
greenes attorney reid w kennedy said wednesday he will fight 
allegations that greene violated the federal law 
im satisfied that he has not violated any law and that 
kershner was not terminated because of any status he may have had 
in the reserves said kennedy 
kennedy would not say why greene fired kershner 
if greene is found to have violated federal law he may have to 
reinstate kershner and pay him for lost wages said james bishop a 
veterans program specialist for the labor departments atlanta 
office 
ive never wanted a job as bad as i wanted this one 
kershner said my fight isnt with state farm its with mr 
greene i was discriminated against and it was unfair for him to do 
what he has done

a hollywood watchdog group for 
american indians has questioned robert redfords decision not to 
cast an indian actor in the leading role of a navajo policeman in 
redfords new film 
lou diamond phillips has been selected to play jim chee in a 
film based on new mexico author tony hillermans novel the dark 
wind redford plans to begin filming on the navajo and hopi 
reservations sept 10 
thats true hollywood said ray baldwin louis a high school 
drama teacher in crystal nm theyve been coming out here for 
years promising to cast navajos in leading roles but they always 
end up with an italian or a foreignborn 
bonnie paradise director of the watchdog group the american 
indian registry for the performing arts in hollywood calif said 
she will meet with redford and phillips within the next three weeks 
mr redford has bought the rights to several books from mr 
hillerman and knowing there are other films down the line that 
follows the same story line we are concerned she said chee 
appears in many of hillermans mysteries 
ms paradise said that phillips claims he is part american 
indian but has not given the registry any documentation as 
requested 
a publicity packet for young guns ii in which phillips 
played a mexicanindian said he is part cherokee filipino 
scottishirish hawaiian and hispanic phillips also played an 
american indian in the 1989 movie renegades 
earlier this month actors equity voted to bar white actor 
jonathan pryce from playing the part of a eurasian pimp in the us 
production of miss saigon now on the london stage but after 
the producer canceled the production which has the largest advance 
ticket sales in broadway history the unions executive council 
reversed itself 
sammye meadows the native american liaison for dark wind 
productions said phillips was offered the contract two weeks ago 
his agent said contract negotiations remained incomplete thursday 
we would have really liked to have a navajo actor play jim 
chee ms meadows said we spent enormous amounts of money 
traveling to powwows we didnt find the actor 
some navajos have criticized hillerman saying he romanticizes 
navajo culture and has no real understanding of it but in 1987 the 
author received an award from the navajos for authentically 
portraying the tribe in his works 
i have a hell of lot of navajo friends and i make them read my 
stuff and they tell me when i am wrong about something hillerman 
said from his home thursday that criticism strikes close to a 
nerve i am sympathetic to the issue damn it i know its 
important to redford 
hillerman said redford delayed the film project at one point 
because he was unsatisfied with the casting hillerman added that 
he was not a big film fan and was unfamiliar with phillips work 
a call to redfords film development company in san monica 
calif seeking comment from the director was not returned thursday 
afternoon

an ariane rocket lifted two 
satellites into orbit thursday consolidating the european 
commercial programs comeback from an explosion that destroyed a 
japanese payload in february 
the unmanned rocket blasted off from the launch pad in french 
guiana in northeastern south america it was the commercial 
programs 38th mission but only the second since the unmanned 
rocket exploded shortly after takeoff in february its two japanese 
communications satellites were ruined 
the resumption of our launches last month has been 
confirmed arianespace president charles bigeot said at ariane 
headquarters in evry france 
the february explosion was a major setback for the ariane 
project which has been plagued by five launch failures and costly 
delays before the disaster about one ariane rocket per month had 
been lifting off from kourou 
french media said the february explosion may have been due to 
sabotage with pieces of cloth purposely stuffed into a coolant 
tube but arianespace which runs the ariane program for the 
european space agency said the explosion was accidental 
on thursday two strapon cylinders of liquid fuel and two of 
solid fuel powered the unmanned threestage ariane 44lp rocket 
the biggest in the ariane series 
on board were a eutelsat 2f1 telecommunications satellite and 
skynet 4c satellite 
eutelsat 2f1 is designed to channel telephone telex and 
television communications to 600 million people in europe north 
africa and the middle east skynet 4c will handle communications 
for the british military 
thursdays launch marked the first since bigeot took over 
arianespace on july 31 from frederic dallest who had headed the 
program from its creation a decade ago arianespace is made up of a 
consortium of european companies 
the next launch is expected sometime in october with two 
american satellites aboard 
despite the explosion in february ariane dominates the 
commercial rocket industry carrying about half the worlds 
payloads into space its main privatesector competitors are the 
american titan4 made by martin marietta corp the atlascentaur

in a letter smuggled to her family a 
woman described the scene in kuwait city food running out iraqi 
soldiers everywhere fear of death or capture 
there is no way out she said 
the aug 21 letter from ruthie schaeffer alkhalaf the 
34yearold american wife of a kuwaiti air force major was routed 
to her family in memphis from kuwait through poland after mrs 
alkhalafs half sister escaped to that country 
i hope and pray it will be over soon i am eating very little 
so there will be more for the kids said mrs alkhalaf who said 
she was hiding out with her husbands relatives 
she grew up in memphis and met her husband kazem alkhalaf 
while he was in the united states to study computer science at 
memphis state university they have lived in kuwait for 10 years 
and have a girl and two boys 
the letter tells of nights punctuated by gunfire in the streets 
and of the fear of being recognized as an american 
in the days immediately following iraqs aug 2 invasion mrs 
alkhalaf dressed in arab garb to stand in line for hours at 
grocery stores rapidly running out of food but those excursions 
ended when iraq ordered foreigners to report to several kuwait 
hotels 
i dont know if they will be going door to door or not she 
said the days are running into each other and we just pray to 
make it through each night 
iraqi soldiers were stationed throughout the city even grocery 
stores she said 
the economic blockade already is affecting kuwait we are 
suffering not the iraqis saddam hussein is controlling every 
grain of rice pray for us she wrote in the letter 
mrs alkhalaf said the invasion was so swift she and her 
husband had no time to withdraw their money from their kuwaiti 
bank which is now closed 
they have looted and robbed this country of every valuable 
they could find even the iraqi women are coming and helping 
themselves to the gold and dress shops she said 
mrs alkhalafs handwritten account was addressed to her 
father joe schaeffer a former memphis car dealer who lives in 
freeport fla 
she gave the letter to her sisterinlaw ava a polish woman 
who was taken out of kuwait by polish embassy officials ava 
alkhalaf is married to kazem alkhalafs brother 
the letter was undated but ava alkhalaf told ruthie schaeffer 
alkhalafs family by phone from gdansk poland that it was 
written aug 21 she typed the letter and faxed a copy to mrs 
alkhalafs father who faxed a copy to memphis lawyer tim 
schaeffer ruthie schaeffer alkhalafs cousin

feelings 
my fears for her safety are never ending but im glad that 
weve received something mrs buehler said im glad to know 
that shes doing all she can do to stay alive and keep her family 
alive 
mrs alkhalaf said she considered fleeing kuwait but heard too 
many stories of refugees dying in the desert of iraqis planting 
land mines 
driving across the desert is very dangerous as there are no 
roads and its easy to get lost she said anyway its too 
late to move in that direction i cant risk it

an independent research team has 
concluded there is no relation between radiation vented during the 
1979 accident at the three mile island nuclear plant and cancer 
rates among children living nearby 
the study for the three mile island public health fund was 
released in june at the annual meeting of the american society of 
epidemiologists an assistant to one of the authors said the report 
will be included in a broader study on tmi health effects scheduled 
for release friday 
according to an abstract of the earlier report the researchers 
used hospital records and other data to reach their conclusions 
which appear to corroborate previous government reports that showed 
no harmful health effects linked to the tmi accident 
the abstract said the study reviewed cases within a 10mile 
radius of the plant which is located on the susquehanna river 
about 10 miles south of harrisburg 
the study was compiled by columbia university epidemiologists 
mervyn susser and maureen hatch also collaborating on the study 
was jan beyea an investigator for the health fund which was 
established out of a 5 million settlement of a 1981 classaction 
lawsuit against the owners of tmi a fourth author was listed as s 
wallenstein 
the new expanded report will appear in the september issue of 
the american journal of epidemiology the study has been largely 
complete for months but its publication has been delayed because 
of revisions by the authors and review by the journals staff 
some community members continue to contend the accident left a 
legacy of health problems that has yet to be officially recognized 
one survey conducted by two former residents in 1984 found an 
increase in cancer rates around tmi but the health department has 
dismissed the findings 
kay pickering a spokeswoman for three mile island alert a 
citizens group said she doubted that new study would go far enough 
to disclose health effects possibly linked to the accident she 
said a better approach would be to track a sample of residents who 
lived within a 5mile radius of the plant at the time of the 
accident she said a similar survey was done the summer after the 
accident 
the people in the community are suffering they believe 
they have been affected she said 
a fiveyear study released by the health department in 1985 
found no evidence of an increase in cancer in a 20mile radius 
around tmi 
the study found no pattern of increased cancer cases or deaths 
but it did turn up isolated instances of higherthanexpected 
cancer rates in several communities downwind from the plant the 
study dismissed those cases as statistically insignificant 
a 1984 survey conducted doortodoor by norman and marjorie 
aamodts found cancer deaths up to seven times higher than expected 
in sections of newberry and fairview townships near the plant the 
department judged the study invalid because it appeared to focus 
unevenly on streets where cancer victims lived 
the accident at tmi 2 occurred when a combination of human and 
mechanical errors caused protective cooling water to be drained 
from the reactor some of the reactors nuclear fuel melted and 
radiation was released into the environment 
a 1986 gpu nuclear corp summary of governmentsponsored studies 
said the 8 millirem average radiation exposure for individuals 
within 10 miles of the plant during the accident was less than the 
10 millirems generated by a single chest xray 
the highest possible exposure for someone who stood naked at 
the plant boundry throughout the accident would have been less 
than 100 millirems according to the review by gpu the plants 
operator

rocks to get the bananas 
now weve had to try to trade the rocks for bananas more often 
and theyre getting less and less cooperative said zoo 
spokeswoman karen killmar 
borneans like to throw things and they have thrown rocks out 
of the enclosures and barely missed people killmar said she 
said the orangutans keep digging holes and finding more rocks

hope evaporated thursday for a quick end to a 
7weekold armed standoff between police and mohawks and quebec 
premier robert bourassas office said he asked the army to move in 
to remove mohawk barriers at two locations 
it said in a statement that bourassa late thursday broke off 
talks aimed at lifting the barricades erected in a land dispute 
bourassa said that because negotiators for the six nations 
iroquois confederacy announced they were withdrawing from talks 
the government is going back to its original plan to use the army 
to take down the barricades according to the statement 
harvey longboat a delegate from the confederacy said in a 
telephone interview from the six nations reserve near brantford 
ontario that his threeman team pulled out of talks early thursday 
morning at the end of an allnight negotiating session 
the walkout came because delegates from the kahnawake reserve 
put old issues including mohawk sovereignty back on the table he 
said 
billy two rivers a kahnawake negotiator denied that new 
demands were put on the table he said the sovereignty issue had 
always been part of the discussions 
an army spokesman at oka capt yvon desjardins said nothing 
has changed we got our orders about two days ago dismantling 
barricades is our mandate we are to act on our own as we see fit 
our mandate has no limit 
bourassa had broken off talks with the mohawks on monday and 
ordered the army to remove the barricades 
lastditch talks between mohawks and government officials this 
week included delegates from the confederacy the highestranking 
traditional leadership of the iroquois which includes the mohawks 
a solution to the conflict seemed in the offing wednesday when 
indians helped canadian soldiers remove two barricades blocking the 
mercier bridge connecting montreal to its southern suburbs 
those mohawks closed the bridge for seven weeks in sympathy with 
the indians in oka 18 miles west of montreal 
but work to tear down other barricades near the bridge stopped 
abruptly thursday after mohawk leaders alleged harassment by 
police and whites 
mohawk leaders said thursday they made significant concessions 
to end the dispute at kahnawake a reserve near the mercier bridge 
and at the kahnesatake reserve near oka 
however mohawk chief joe norton told reporters at the mercier 
bridge that shipments of food and medicine were being blocked from 
entering the kahnawake reserve both by angry residents of the area 
and by the police 
he warned we can still close the mercier bridge again 
he also said negotiations to end the standoff at kahnesatake 
near oka were headed for trouble if harassment by police 
and whites continues 
chief billy two rivers said mohawks have been asked to give up 
too much 
maybe some of the white people didnt see indian blood but 
unfortunately we cant give them everything he said 
quebec provincial police denied the charges of harassment i 
can categorically state that no food is being kept out of kahnawake 
whatsoever said capt donald roy an army spokesman 
the standoff began july 11 when the quebec provincial police 
stormed an oka barricade manned by mohawks trying to block the 
expansion of a golf course on land they consider ancestral the 
police were repulsed and one officer killed but it is still not 
clear who shot him 
the dispute has prompted sympathy protests by indians at the 
mercier bridge and elsewhere but it has also touched off an 
antiindian backlash amng residents angered by the barricades 
the scene at the main barricade at oka was relaxed earlier 
thursday with only a few mohawks occasionally appearing 
most of kanesatakes 1500 residents have left as a result of 
the confrontation an estimated 200 to 300 remain

a rapist who forces his elderly 
victims to pose for photographs before he assaults them has claimed 
his fourth victim in a northeast section of the city in the last 
year police said 
what hes doing to these women is unbelievable said fort 
lauderdale sexual battery detective jan blackburn 
a 73yearold woman was attacked early tuesday while she slept 
in her home she told police the assailant had a camera and that he 
forced her to be photographed in obscene poses before raping her 
police say they believe the same man committed all four rapes 
because of the methods of the attack and the womens description of 
the rapist the first attack occurred sept 8 and the women ranged 
in age from 64 to 80 
each was awakened in the early morning blindfolded and 
photographed in obscene poses before being raped and in each case 
the man unplugged or cut telephone lines fort lauderdale police 
sgt dave geyer said 
in all but tuesdays case the man attacked on a sunday morning 
and stole cash 
a 75yearold woman avoided becoming the fifth known victim 
earlier this year by pushing a alarm button in her home scaring 
off the rapist geyer said 
the rapist lectured the victims about how they invited the 
attacks because their homes were insufficiently secured blackburn 
said the man apparently gains entry through windows and doors 
some attacks may have gone unreported because the women were too 
embarrassed blackburn said 
he uses a psychological ploy on the victims to cause them to 
believe theyre responsible for the attack which makes them less 
likely to report it geyer said

demonstrated wednesday to press demands that their commanders 
resign and parliament pass a law depoliticizing the force

blaming the police for failing to prevent anticommunist 
demonstrators from torching the headquarters of the ruling 
socialist party the reformed communists on sunday 
later wednesday parliament passed a resolution condemning the 
burning of the socialist party headquarters as a blow against 
democracy 
anticommunist demonstrators ransacked the building in downtown 
sofia and set it afire sunday night incensed by the red star the 
symbol of communist oneparty rule atop the building 
 
the blaze destroyed much of the building and damaged adjoining 
structures police stood by for an hour as the anticommunist 
demonstrators prevented firefighters from fighting the blaze 
police on the scene said they did not intervene immediately because 
they had received no orders to do so 
on wednesday police officers and civilian supporters 
demonstrated on the square in front of downtown alexander nevski 
cathedral to press their demands for a new law defining the 
militias rights and duties 
addressing the rally from atop a police van speaker after 
speaker accused politicians of leaving them in the lurch and warned 
that they might stop protecting parliament unless lawmakers passed 
the new law 
resign resign the police demonstrators chanted as their 
speakers called on interior ministry officials and their commanders 
to step down 
it is high time that the incompetent people quit the criteria 
must be professionalism one militia lieutenant told the crowd 
he and other speakers demanded that parliament pass within a 
week a decree depoliticizing the militia they claimed that many 
militia commanders continued to be associates or relatives of 
communist officials ousted in the democratic upheaval that began 
last november with the removal of hardline communist party leader 
todor zhivkov 
one lowranking officer complained that police were poorly 
equipped to deal with the galloping crime rate 
later in the day the parliament passed a resolution saying that 
lawmakers understand the police demands and would enact a law 
regulating the militias activities soon 
the resolution also denounced the arson attack on the socialist 
party headquarters as a serious political crime and a blow 
against democracy 
the official media did not provide any vote totals on the 
resolution but said that all of the deputies present voted for it 
except for three who abstained a majority of deputies are members 
of the socialist party 
after purging party conservatives the ruling communist party 
renamed itself the socialist party and won the countrys first free 
elections in more than four decades in june but since then its 
popularity has dropped as many bulgarians blame it for shortages 
of basic consumer goods and other economic problems

democrats are mobilizing local officials to 
protest preliminary census figures and pressure the government to 
take another look at the count for the nations cities and rural 
areas

by fewer than 70000 during the past decade 
way out of line atlanta mayor maynard jackson said of the

after a 20year battle an inventor with the 
habits of a monk has received a patent that could make him a rich 
man assure him a place in the history of the information age and 
spell trouble for the computer industry 
gilbert hyatt a 52yearold engineer received the patent july 
17 for a singlechip computer he invented in 1968 
the patent appears to cover chips in everything from pocket 
calculators to cars to phones to electronic dishwashers but 
experts disagreed on whether it applies to all microprocessor chips 
and millions of personal computers based on them 
hyatt who lives in suburban la palma works 14 hours a day 
seven days a week he doesnt take vacations and he doesnt drink 
or smoke 
he battled with the us patent office for two decades before he 
was granted the patent he said he hopes to negotiate licenses 
under which electronics companies will pay him royalties for using 
his invention but any money will go toward expanding his 
laboratory near his home and perhaps hiring researchers a 
departure from his solitary work habits he said

dont worry mom and dad surprisingly few 
schoolchildren trade the fruit in their lunch boxes for twinkies 
take the kids word for it 
of 400 children ages 612 queried in a nationwide gallup poll in 
august 77 percent said they eat the fruit their parents pack for 
them five percent said they trade or throw it away others said 
that what they do depends on the fruit 
it could be that there is simply less junk food to trade for 
the survey commissioned by the florida department of citrus 
found that 57 percent of 414 parents who were polled said they pack 
fruit daily in lunch boxes four percent of parents said they never 
packed fruit 
in addition 27 percent of the parents said the lunches they 
pack are healthier than lunches their own parents gave them and 85 
percent said they would like to eat what they pack for their 
childrens lunches

the students were demanding an end to battles between xhosas who 
mostly support the african national congress and zulus who back

animal cancer tests in which rodents are fed 
massive doses of chemicals may be useless for calculating the 
cancer risks in humans because the dose itself may be causing the 
disease researchers say 
in articles to be published friday in the journal science two 
research groups question the value of governmentsupported cancer 
tests on rats one suggested the united states should drop its 
concern about trivial traces of synthetic chemicals in the 
environment 
bruce n ames a professor of cell biology at the university of 
california berkeley said cancer develops in rats fed high doses 
of chemicals because cells in the test animal are killed by the 
chemicals and are then replaced 
each time replacement cells are grown said ames there is a 
risk of a cancer mutation the more cells that are replaced over a 
lifetime the higher the odds of a cell mutating into cancer but 
he said the cancer may be caused by the dose not by the chemical 
action itself

when murray friedman was at college in the 
1940s and 50s jewish students would sometimes americanize their 
names to avoid being considered outsiders nowadays he said a few 
are even changing back to israeli or biblical names 
weve seen a reethnicization of american life said 
friedman director of the temple center for the study of american 
jewish history recently established here 
this reethnicization has had a positive and some negative 
effects he said in general more positive because the nation 
has always been a nation of groups the multiplicity of groups 
really goes back a long way in american life 
the center part of temple universitys college of arts and 
sciences aims to encourage systematic research and organize 
conferences on american jewish life 
the creation of a center reflects a community reexamining its 
history and traditions said friedman its a relatively new 
field of study american jewish history has not been probed very 
deeply 
a small jewish community existed in america from the countrys 
beginnings he said when the constitution was celebrated in 1787 
philadelphias jewish community was invited to the celebration and 
created a kosher table 
when jews fled pogroms in europe and poured into the united 
states in the 1880s the philadelphia jewish community functioned 
as a cohesive force during a period when several million jews 
needed to be integrated into society both as jews and americans 
friedman said 
in tandem with jewish settlers in new york the philadelphians 
provided intellectual leadership and in the 1920s helped create 
what became the central institutions of american jewish life he 
said 
during a period of intense bigotry overseas and to a lesser 
extent in the united states the basic model was to disappear into 
the melting pot to assimilate friedman said 
however that pattern is changing as a result of greater 
tolerance toward jews and a rise in pride in being one he said 
much of american jewish history is made up of crises 
friedman said citing the problems of immigration and adjustment 
the ku klux klan in the 1920s the great depression and the rise of 
adolf hitler 
at the end of world war ii perhaps for the first time the 
jewish community of america could breathe easier he said we 
rushed headlong into the opportunities that opened up in american 
life by the 50s we were moving up very rapidly 
in general american life has been very good to jews he said 
jews played an active role in the earliest stages of the civil 
rights movement and helped found the national association for the 
advancement of colored people said friedman who was a civil 
rights worker in 195459 in richmond va 
in the 50s and 60s political liberalism was the secular 
religion of us jews beginning in 1967 up to the present period 
israel has been the secular religion of american jews friedman 
said 
friedman said he felt american jews were becoming increasingly 
uncomfortable with israels response to palestinian unrest in the 
west bank but he added i see no diminution of fundamental 
jewish support for israel 
friedman 63 is the middle atlantic director of the american 
jewish committee the author of two books on the history of 
philadelphia jewry he is preparing a book on the history of 
blackjewish relations 
he said the idea that relations between the two communities were 
all great before deteriorating in the late 1960s is a bit of 
a fallacy 
the relationship was always complex and at times ambivalent 
he said 
he said it was hard to give an easy answer on the future of 
blackjewish relations but there are elements in both 
communities anxious to break out of hostilities and conflicts in 
recent years he said 
he referred to a new study by the national opinion center of the 
university of chicago that concluded the overall movement of 
jewish attitudes towards racial tolerance is abundantly evident 
and clearly refutes the idea of a jewish backlash against 
blacks

the us catholic conference is urging reform 
in the nations labor laws to outlaw permanent replacement of 
workers involved in a legitimate strike 
in a labor day message written by monsignor george higgins a 
labor expert the conference said as long as employers can hire 
permanent replacement workers the right to strike will be merely a 
right to quit 
employers know the consequences of hiring permanent 
replacements the message says many who do so are not 
motivated solely by the need to keep their factories operating but 
by a desire to get rid of the union 
the right to strike without fear of reprisal is fundamental in 
our democratic society

you might be too depressed to read this but 
please hang on for a minute 
youre not alone depression afflicts as many as 20 million 
other americans every year if you tune in to abcs 2020 
tonight youll see how people can cope with it and get better 
abraham lincoln had it so did writer william styron who talks 
about it on 2020 winston churchill called it the black dog 
on my back and would simply disappear for days bedridden and 
unable to function 
ten percent of men and at least 20 percent of women will suffer 
at least one episode of depression 
depression is an illness its as real as diabetes and just as 
treatable and just as deadly if left untreated unlike diabetes 
it is curable 
its a very high percentage for a disease that is not 
recognized as a disease said hugh downs who anchors the 
onehour special 
depression is not just a bad case of the blues it is one of the 
purest forms of mental anguish a debilitating unending grief 
without focus people who havent had it cant really understand it 
only a third of people who suffer depression seek help for it 
the destruction of hope is the most cruel aspect of it said 
downs 
clinical depression its severest form is deadly said dr 
harold eist a bethesda md psychiatrist who has treated 
thousands of depressed people during his career 
its a terrible painful illness that interferes with 
motivation that tangles their thoughts that makes them hopeless 
that fills them with despair that fills them with selfhatred 
says eist 
and finally the pain is so great the only way our they can see 
is destroying themselves there are very few illnesses of that 
magnitude 
nobody knows exactly what causes depression or why certain drugs 
can ease it researchers have found that depression tends to run in 
families and they are searching for a genetic link 
i think its worse at times than physical pain said one 
sufferer physical pain you know goes away depression doesnt go 
away overnight its not where you say well ok ill go to bed 
and tomorrow morning ill wake up ill feel fine well start a 
new day depression just lingers and lingers 
depressions milder form is dysthymia which means bad mood 
in the same way that angina pectoris means pain in the chest 
downs said its a constant chronic lowgrade depression that can 
rob life of any pleasure 
in addition to interviews with depressions victims and their 
families tonights 2020 looks at the various treatment 
options available 
new methods of talk therapy combined with antidepressant 
drugs have helped many people and are less expensive than 
traditional psychoanalysis a longterm deep therapy with a 
psychiatrist 
2020 also discusses an old technique used as a last resort 
in treating the deepest intractable depressions electroconvulsive 
shock therapy in which a mild electric current zaps the brain 
inducing convulsions 
downs said he and writerproducer jonathan talmadge hope that 
the program will encourage depressed people to get help 
if it was just another geefolksaintthisawful syndrome we 
wouldnt have put it on downs said

asian governments that want to control what 
their people see on television are fighting a losing battle with 
satellites and receiving dishes 
direct broadcasts from foreign countries into private homes via 
satellite are spreading rapidly 
some officials fret over the impact on their peoples values and 
way of life western diplomats say others fear their social and 
political control might be questioned if citizens have wider 
freedom of choice 
ever smaller and cheaper receiving dishes and the launch of a 
major telecommunications satellite make it increasingly difficult 
for governments to deny viewers direct access to foreign television 
we may not be able to check foreign tv intruding into our 
lives for much longer prime minister lee kuan yew of singapore 
said in 1988 but he has done a pretty good job so far 
the only known satellitereception dish not in his governments 
hands that is capable of receiving foreign programs sits on the 
roof of the us embassy installation was permitted strictly for 
embassy use two years after an application was filed 
others in this prosperous citystate are prohibited by law from 
owning or selling such dishes except for export foreign programs 
for the three singapore broadcasting corp channels are screened to 
filter out unacceptable and harmful values and lifestyles said 
communications official mah bow tan 
one official said full access to foreign tv shows permissive 
american offerings especially could harm a young nation composed 
of different races religions and cultures he said censorship of 
foreign movies magazines and tv was necessary to repel cultural 
subversion 
not everyone agrees lim boon heng a member of parliament said 
the government should consider broadcasting to the surrounding 
region by satellite and stop trying to control the use of receiving 
dishes 
compact new receivers are small enough to fit into a suitcase 
and lim said when dishes get to that size the authorities will 
have a hard time to control the use of satellite receivers so 
why fight it 
a major enemy in this information war is positioned slightly to 
the east and 22753 miles up asiasat1 was launched from china in 
april by a long march iii rocket and is in orbit near the equator 
telecommunications satellites are not new to the region 
indonesia was the first country in asia and third in the world 
after canada and the united states to have a domestic satellite 
japan and australia also have communications satellites 
asiasat1 the first privately owned satellite has the 
potential to beam signals to and from the middle east singapore 
and tokyo and could offer a dozen new channels to an area with 
more than 2 billion potential viewers the owner is a consortium 
led by hutchison whampoa holdings ltd and based in hong kong 
in indonesia alone where reception from the governments palapa 
series of satellites was established in 1976 an estimated 25000 
dishes can pick up asiasat1 
hong kong officials announced in early august that individuals 
could own and operate dishes for personal use without licenses 
lifting a ban that had been widely ignored for years broadcasters 
and operators of dishes that serve more than one viewer must have 
licenses 
elsewhere the picture is equally mixed 
satellite dishes are legal in the philippines upon approval of 
an application but few applications are approved those who can 
afford it put them up anyway apparently assuming the government 
has more important rules to enforce 
direct reception of satellite television still is forbidden in 
thailand which maintains close control over telecommunications 
but pressure against the policy is increasing 
we cannot stop technologies from growing joompol rodcumdee 
of chulalongkorn university in thailand told a regional seminar on 
the socioeconomic impact of broadcast satellites 
today we may say we will not use them but tomorrow we may not 
be able to get away from them he said 
vijay menon secretarygeneral of the asian mass communication 
research and information center said the estimated 150000 
satellite dishes in south korea were not viewed as a blessing or 
even as a sign of progress 
journalism professors have been filling local newspapers with 
letters denouncing the impact of foreign tv on korean society he 
said foreign programs they feel are making viewers in korea 
adopt alien ways of thinking life and customs and deepening the 
dependency of korea on alien culture 
malaysia bans private satellites for direct tv reception and 
madzhi johari of the government broadcast training institute said 
direct access to broadcasting satellites means direct import of 
norms and values of the developed countries and will result in 
stress and conflict in our society indonesians seem relaxed 
about the impact of numerous private dishes which fall into a 
legal nomans land neither permitted nor forbidden 
there is no need to be alarmed over the possible unfavorable 
consequences be they cultural political or economic said a 
senior executive at tvri the government network 
diplomats in jakarta attribute the lack of concern to the fact 
that most foreign programs are in english or other languages 
relatively few indonesians understand

santana also oversaw the auction of 20 governmentowned 
mansions formerly used rentfree by top bureaucrats and ordered 
the sale of 19700 apartments 4800 vehicles and five airplanes 
when he took office collor said the bureaucracy was consuming 
95 percent of tax revenues and causing a 31 billion deficit which 
was considered the main reason inflation had reached 5000 percent 
a year 
he ordered a 25 percent reduction in the governments 16 
million employees as part of his antiinflation plan and chose 
santana 32 to do the job 
after santana went to work the government employees union of 
brasilia held a symbolic funeral for the executioner and he 
even received physical threats 
santana said he feels most brazilians support him 
i dont consider myself a satan and the administrative reform 
is not the work of the devil he said in an interview on the 
contrary the reform will exorcize the states infernal inability 
to attend taxpayers who deserve good services 
the reforms including wiping out 12 cabinet ministries and 
closing dozens of state companies and agencies cut expenses in 
june to just 50 percent of tax revenues he said 
politicians now seek his endorsement and people stop him in the 
street to urge greater reductions he said 
a month ago few congressmen wanted to have their picture 
taken next to me santana told the interviewer now many do i 
even taped political tv spots where i say im with this candidate 
because hes just like me 
santana entered politics as a leftist opponent of the military 
regimes that governed brazil for 21 years until 1985 in 1979 he 
helped found the marxistoriented workers party that now is the 
collor governments main opposition 
he later abandoned leftist politics graduated from the sao 
paulo univeristy law school and worked in the sao paulo state 
government when santanas friend zelia cardoso de mello was chosen 
as collors economy minister she recommended him to carry out the 
bureaucratic reform 
brazilian presidents have tried or promised to shrink the 
bureaucracy for 50 years without success 
jose sarney collors predecessor established a ministry of 
debureaucratization and declared in a speech spending is 
forbidden the bureaucracy got bigger 
joao geraldo piquet carneiro who directed the same task in the 
military years said the problem was not too many government 
workers but poor distribution of them 
the number of civil servants is not disproportional to the 
population of 150 million piquet carneiro said but added that 
it was easier to fire workers than to reassign them 
santana acknowledged the reforms had political enemies and 
had cost the president support in congress 
many dismissed employees have gone to court seeking 
reinstatement the government lost a court case on reducing the pay 
of workers sent home 
another obstacle is a clause in the 1988 constitution that says 
government workers with five years of seniority cannot be fired 
according to santana the main resistance is in brasilia the 
capital which has 70000 civil servants and rio a former capital 
that still has 160000 government functionaries 
a survey of 590 government workers in brasilia revealed to the 
surprise of many people that 58 percent felt the layoffs were 
necessary 
i sleep soundly santana said when i finish the reform we 
will have fewer public functionaries and more wellpaid 
professionals

the latest economic indicators in the soviet 
union offer a dismal verdict of president mikhail gorbachevs 
failure to pull the soviet economy out of a steep nosedive 
official government figures showed that the total output of 
goods and services shrank by 1 percent in the first six months of 
1990 the traditional sign of a recession in a western economy 
in addition the countrys trade deficit has more than doubled 
so far this year while unemployment is up and inflation has 
increased dramatically all of this is coming at a time when soviet 
consumers are having a harder time getting food and the government 
has a dwindling supply of hard currency to buy grain overseas 
the soviet economy is disintegrating said marshall goldman 
the associate director of harvards russian research center 
everybody is standing around watching moscow burn but nobody 
knows what to do about it 
gorbachev is appealing for massive financial aid to turn the 
situation around but the united states and many of its allies are 
demanding a look at the soviet balance sheets before they commit to 
any major assistance programs 
many analysts believe those studies especially one being 
conducted by the international monetary fund could prove critical 
in determining the fate of gorbachevs faltering economic reforms 
gorbachevs appeals for western aid will be considered this 
month when the imf and its sister organization the world bank 
hold their annual meetings in washington on sept 2027 
no decisions on those appeals are expected from the meetings 
but finance ministers from the 152 nations that make up the two 
organizations will discuss the imfled study which was ordered by 
president bush and other western leaders this summer at the 
economic summit of leading industrial nations in houston 
the study was a compromise between demands by the french and 
west germans for an immediate 15billion aid package and 
resistance to direct economic aid by bush and other summit leaders 
it is scheduled to be completed in december 
the international monetary fund generally is viewed as the top 
cop of international finance its clout stems not just from the 
loans it hands out but also from the fact that other lenders take 
their cue from the fund 
if for example the imf does not approve of a nations plans to 
get its economic house in order that nation has a hard time 
getting credit 
but imf austerity programs have in the past triggered bloody 
riots in third world nations unhappy with the prescription to curb 
runaway inflation 
whether the soviet union with its long history of distrust of 
western capitalism will readily accept imf dictates remains to be 
seen 
the study team faces other formidable obstacles 
there is the question of how to measure the soviet economy 
which operates with a currency that is not convertible into other 
foreign currencies 
while the central intelligence agency estimates that the soviet 
economy was roughly 51 percent the size of americas 42 trillion 
economy in 1989 other experts have attacked those figures as 
grossly inflated and suggested that the total output of soviet 
goods and services is really only onethird that of americas gross 
national product 
the imf study may resolve this debate since one of its main 
jobs will be to conduct an exhaustive look at a host of economic 
statistics these include soviet gross national product trade 
statistics and the amount of hard currency on hand to pay for 
shortfalls between what the country sells overseas and what it 
imports 
for decades the soviet union was considered a good 
international credit risk because the government always promptly 
paid its import bills but because of a widening trade gap the 
soviets have fallen behind on their payments and are seeking trade 
credits from other nations 
west germany already has agreed to 3 billion of such credits 
and other european nations are expected to follow suit 
the bush administration however has so far rejected proposals 
for direct financial aid and instead offered technical assistance 
including advice on improving the collapsing food distribution 
system or how to establish private banking 
but many experts believe that the soviet problems are so severe 
they can be resolved only by a major overhaul of the economy and 
massive economic support from the west 
the soviets face fundamental economic problems that are not 
amenable to quick fixes said jeffrey schott an expert at the 
institute for international economics a washingtonbased research 
organization the question of restructuring their entire economy 
and their distribution system will take quite a number of years to 
accomplish

americans arent particularly crazy about lamb 
and mutton they prefer beef pork and poultry by an overwhelming 
margin 
but an agriculture department analysis says the us sheep 
industry is thriving despite the consumer snub partly because of 
drastic adjustments made in management and partly because of 
government subsidies 
the industry has adjusted to a longterm decline unmatched by 
any other livestock sector the report said producers returns 
have consistently been positive in recent years and marketing 
facilities and slaughtering plants have been adjusted to gain scale 
economies for a declining industry 
two distinct enterprises have developed the report said stock 
sheep producers manage grazing flocks on pasture and range forage 
frequently this involves arid land that has few other possible uses 
the other type of enterprise is lamb feeding usually in 
feedlots where young animals are fattened on grain for the 
slaughter market about 65 percent of the lambs slaughtered go 
through feedlots 
historically the us sheep flock has at times seemed on the 
verge of extinction the usda began records on stock sheep in 1867 
when 45 million head were reported the peak was 51 million in 1884 
but dropped to 33 million in 1923 
stock sheep increased again during world war ii rising to 49 
million in 1942 but has declined in most years since 
as of jan 1 1990 the stock sheep inventory was estimated at 
965 million head up 5 percent from a year earlier about 17 
million sheep and lambs were reported in feedlots up 4 percent 
stock sheep inventories are expected to remain in the range of 8 
million to 10 million head in the next few years 
counting lambs in feedlots the total us flock peaked at 56 
million in 1942 the jan 1 total was 114 million head 
lambs on feed are concentrated in the great plains and 
california the report said costs will continue to encourage 
lamb feeding in finishing animals grain feeding generally costs 
less per pound of grain than range feeding 
the report which was ordered by congress in the omnibus trade 
and competitiveness act of 1988 said sheep producers compete with 
cattle producers for grazing land labor water and marketing and 
transportation facilities 
sheep production which generally yields higher returns than 
cattle production also requires more intensive use of labor and 
management the report said 
part of the reason for these relatively higher returns has 
been a government program supporting the prices received for 
domestic wool production the report noted in 1987 17 percent 
of stock sheep receipts came from government payments 
the subsidies stem from the national wool act of 1954 which 
provides payments to producers when market prices fall below annual 
support levels mohair clipped from goats also is eligible 
payments this year for example are expected to be around 100 
million split about equally between wool and mohair 
the house and senate farm bills now waiting on conference action 
to settle differences include sections that would continue the 
annual wool payments although limiting them to 250000 a year to 
individual producers 
according to the report sheep production in the united states 
has become a specialty industry that has only minor consumer 
demand 
unless there is a major change in the demand for lamb that 
would raise returns and attract new producers the level of 
production will likely cycle around present levels in the 
foreseeable future the report said 
figures by usda show per capita consumption of lamb and mutton 
mostly lamb averaged 15 pounds last year based on a retail 
weight equivalent 
that compares with total red meat consumption of 1347 pounds 
per person in 1989 including 689 pounds of beef 632 pounds of 
pork and 12 pounds of veal 
poultry consumption meanwhile was an average of 858 pounds 
per person in 1989 including 666 pounds of broilers or young 
chicken 
the main challenge to the us lamb industry is to expand 
consumption of a relatively expensive red meat in a market where 
poultry is capturing more of the red meat market because of lower 
relative prices the report said furthermore only a small 
segment of the population consumes lamb which means that the 
industry also needs to attract new consumers to expand 
consumption 
although sheep producers have complained for years about 
competition from imports of lamb from australia and new zealand 
the analysts didnt agree this is so 
us imports and domestic production of lamb have both 
declined at about the same rate indicating that the decline in the 
lamb industry is not the result of import penetration but due 
mainly to a decline in consumer demand 
the report was written by economists richard stillman terry 
crawford and lorna aldrich of the departments economic research 
service 
copies of the report the us sheep industry ages 9048 can be 
obtained at 8 each from ersnass po box 1608 rockville md

how to make something worth nothing worth 
something 
the soviet union is trying to turn its practically worthless 
ruble into an internationally accepted currency and the task is 
putting the worlds leading economists to the test 
so far the verdict is that making something of value of the 
bills that carry the hammer and sickle wont be easy but its an 
essential step on the soviet road toward the modern economic world 
rubles are worth nothing outside the soviet union because the 
government has refused to back them with hard currency gold or 
silver tourists are allowed to take only a few rubles into or out 
of the country and even that was prohibited until recently 
this has insulated the ruble from the ups and downs of world 
money markets but has reduced moscow to conducting much of its 
foreign trade as barter trading stolichnaya vodka for pepsicola 
for instance the government sells its precious natural resources 
to earn foreign currency 
as soviet economists debate how to establish a marketdriven 
economy they are increasingly aware of the need for a convertible 
currency 
government economists are expected to announce a 500day plan to 
move toward a market system and make the ruble fully convertible by 
the turn of the century 
transforming the ruble will be complex 
to begin with a rubles comparative worth is unclear the 
government maintains two official exchange rates that allow 
foreigners to buy a ruble for either 159 or 16 cents depending 
on the nature of the transaction 
the second rate available only to tourists is widely regarded 
as more accurately reflecting the rubles real value said ed 
hewett an economist at the brookings institution in washington 
making the ruble freely convertible would allow the world market 
to determine its worth but that could bring substantial pain to 
soviet consumers said jeffrey sachs a harvard university 
economist who has been an architect of polands shock therapy 
economic reforms 
soviet citizens have an extraordinarily high savings rate 
because there is little for them to buy and subsidized prices of 
many staple goods are artificially low 
according to sachs if the ruble became convertible overnight 
people would have a large amount of money to spend on western goods 
the classic money chasing goods form of inflation 
that could create inflation so severe that the government might 
fall said josef brada of arizona state university 
sachs suggested the danger of inflation could be lessened by 
having the government simultaneously double prices and wages 
effectively reducing the potential strength of savings 
raising prices is the least popular element of proposed economic 
reforms however and plans for a gradual change to convertibility 
have been put forward 
brada led a panel of experts that proposed a fivestep plan last 
year in the first phase some hard currency would be made 
available at auction for state enterprises to buy with rubles 
the auction would gradually be broadened to include 
cooperatives private enterprise and joint ventures after that 
households would be allowed to own foreign currencies and 
foreigners would be given the right to exchange their currencies 
for rubles at a rate determined by the market 
in august the government said some businesses would be allowed 
to trade rubles for hard currency at a market rate beginning next 
year as a step toward making the ruble convertible 
brada said his stepbystep approach would protect consumers 
from the first volatile days of convertibility and act as a 
whip to drive industry 
he said soviet industries that produce the best products and 
would have the best chance in world markets are probably the 
richest in rubles and in the best position to buy large amounts of 
hard currency 
they could use the hard currency for successful foreign 
ventures and inefficient factories without the rubles to buy hard 
currency would fall aside 
if convertibility accomplishes anything it reallocates 
resources from inefficient to efficient industries brada said 
proposals with many of the same concepts but in different 
sequences were among the winners of a suggestion contest sponsored 
by an american philanthropist this year in those proposals 
creation of an efficient marketoriented economy is seen as a 
necessary precursor of convertibility 
hewett one of the contest judges said the soviet union must be 
able to offer a range of products that is broad and deep enough 
to compete on the world market before the ruble becomes fully 
convertible 
otherwise he said rubles would be spent on foreign goods and 
the soviet union would have no way of earning hard currency 
to that brada added that having a healthy manufacturing base is 
better support for a currency than gold reserves 
gold is readily indentifiable but the value of a 
currency in international terms is the countrys ability to 
export he said 
after determining how to make the ruble convertible the soviet 
government would have to consider the extent to which it was 
prepared to intervene in the exchange market buying rubles with 
gold or foreign currencies to support the ruble if its price 
started to fall 
my suspicion is that the soviets would do a lot of 
intervention brada said psychologically they have a strong 
preference for stability 
in the initial stages convertibility will be just a look at 
what the ruble can do in various activities brada said 
if it cant do much winners of the convertibility competition 
wont have to worry the prize money was in dollars 42000 of them

this beautiful baroque city built in 
portugals days of empire is crumbling and rotting away 
its 18th century churches are deteriorating and rain penetrates 
their wooden roofs to destroy paintings and sculptures heavy 
traffic tears up the cobblestones 
ouro preto is heading for selfdestruction said the rev 
jose feliciano simoes who was born here and serves on the latin 
american commission of sacred art 
the colonial city in the mountains of east central brazil has 
been designated part of mankinds world heritage by the united 
nations it has 38 churches and chapels dating from portuguese 
rule which began in the 16th century and ended in 1822 
simoes said government neglect has permitted serious damage to 
nearly all of them and the problem is compounded by leaking roofs 
that allow rain to erode walls wooden fixtures and priceless 
paintings 
eight of the 13 major churches in the citys historic central 
district have had to be closed all or part of the time 
if the government doesnt act immediately a primary symbol of 
our art and cultural identity will be lost the priest said 
ouro pretos name means black gold in portuguese huge gold 
deposits were found nearby and during much of the 18th century it 
was one of south americas richest and most important cities 
gold money financed a rich development of arts and culture in 
the city 235 miles northwest of rio de janeiro the opera house 
built in 1770 is one of the oldest in latin america 
culture shared the stage with politics joaquim jose da silva 
xavier who was known as tiradentes and led a revolt against 
portuguese rule in the late 18th century was a resident of ouro 
preto 
he lost and was executed in 1792 but many still consider him 
the george washington of brazil 
the roman catholic church was a pillar of colonial rule and a 
generous share of mineral wealth went to build the ornate churches 
that grace the citys streets and dot its hillsides 
when the gold cycle ended in the early 19th century ouro 
preto entered a long slow economic decline but remains 
internationally known as a treasury of history and culture 
ouro pretos churches were constructed by some of brazils 
greatest artists and are among the most beautiful in the country 
said carlos jose aparecido de oliveira director of the carmo 
museum of sacred art the loss of even one of them would 
represent a national tragedy 
simoes church our lady of pilar is the richest and most 
ostentatious adorned with 950 pounds of gold and 840 pounds of 
silver it was completed in 1733 and is one of only two in 
nearperfect condition 
he traced the citys latest problems to the costcutting of 
president fernando collor de mello who was inaugurated in march 
the two federal agencies charged with historic preservation were 
abolished and the brazilian institute of cultural heritage their 
replacement is still being organized 
collors plan also ended the sarney law decreed by his 
predecessor jose sarney which allowed private companies to deduct 
contributions to cultural projects 
the combined effect was to halt all restoration projects in ouro 
preto and open the door to illegal construction that further 
disfigures the city 
architect janice nascimento is the only remaining employee at 
the office for historic and cultural preservation which is to 
continue functioning until the new institute takes over and 
described her situation as desperate 
she said the offices only engineer and the six staff members 
who inspected for illegal constructions had been dismissed 
we have so little money i have to pay for the gas in the 
agencys car she said there has been a steep increase in 
illegal building and i am unable to do anything about it 
ms nascimento said another serious problem is that city 
officials have ignored pleas to bar heavy trucks that destroy 
cobblestone streets in the central district and weaken buildings 
with vibration 
many residents dont see the need to preserve the city she 
said they see it preservation as a sign of backwardness 
the worst problems plague st francis of assisi church the 
masterwork of antonio francisco lisboa better known as aleijadinho 
and considered the greatest brazilian artist of the colonial period 
it has two round bell towers a trompe loeil painting of the 
virgin mary and a flock of angels covering the nave ceiling and 
two magnificent soapstone medallions above the main entry sculpted 
by alejadinho 
in addition to major cracks and chips in the medallions and 
serious internal damage caused by a leaky roof the arch that 
separates the main altar from the nave is crumbling and held up by 
scaffolding 
elsewhere the situation is equally grim 
rainwater has eaten away elaborately carved wooden side altars 
of the rosary church one of two that was used exclusively by black 
slaves wall and ceiling murals have virtually disappeared 
scaffolding covers much of the facade of st francis of paula 
which was built in the 19th century and is the citys newest 
church money for the restoration ran out recently and the church 
is closed 
our lady of conception the largest church in the city and one 
of the oldest was to be entirely restored with private 
contributions but only the ceiling was fixed before the collor 
plan halted work 
a major landslide late last year damaged a side wall of our lady 
of grace and pardons it has not been repaired 
if we have a period of heavy rains this year we are going to 
have a disaster on our hands and any further damage may be 
irreversible simoes said

the iraqi invasion of kuwait means an end to traditional 
political alignments in the middle east 
saudi arabia and the gulf states have now opted for close 
relations with the west this is a remarkable change from past 
practice it will mean more military security for the saudis but 
opens the possibility of a reaction among those who resent the 
presence of foreign nonmuslim powers in the heart of the islamic 
world the us military presence in saudi arabia and the gulf is 
likely to continue for some time even after this crisis passes 
egypts security ties with the west are likely to grow and will

the threat of a desert war is hanging over the 
1990 midterm campaign and leaving candidates struggling to get the 
attention of an electorate worried about the military confrontation 
between the united states and iraq 
politics in the fall is going to be on hold said michael 
mccurry spokesman for the democratic national committee 
iraq knocked everything off the radar screen said ed 
rollins cochairman of the house republican campaign committee 
this first midterm election of the george bush presidency was 
anticipated as the political battle that could set the tone for the 
final decade of the 20th century 
at stake this fall are 35 senate seats 36 governors and the 
entire us house along with thousands of state legislators 
republicans recruited a strong set of challengers to bolster 
their hopes of narrowing the 55to45 democratic majority in the 
senate for democrats the hottest prospects are in races for 
governor particularly in california and florida 
the biggest prize this year is control of the redistricting 
process the redrawing of us house and legislative districts to 
reflect the results of the 1990 census preliminary census figures 
would mandate a shift of 19 us house seats most of them going 
from the industrial north and midwest to the south and west 
races for governor and legislative seats will determine which 
party draws the lines in many key states including california 
which gains seven new house seats 
a month ago the issues seemed clear the economy was sluggish 
and the budget deficit persistent president bush backed away from 
his no new taxes pledge as he entered budget negotiations with 
congressional democrats politicians in both parties were 
scrambling to distance themselves from former contributors in the 
savings and loan industry 
everyone was against drugs and in favor of improving the 
nations schools and cleaning up the environment the discomfort 
index over past positions on abortion remained high 
then saddam hussein ordered his army into kuwait 
political commercials are on the air candidates are debating 
but there is an uneasy feeling no one is listening and races could 
be decided on local issues rather than broad national themes 
the middle east has pretty well dominated the situation 
here said stephen roberts republican national committeeman for 
iowa its been pretty hard for the politics to get through 
iowa has two hardfought statewide races rep tom tauke is 
challenging democratic sen tom harkin in what is regarded as one 
of the tighter senate races democrat don avenson is trying to 
unseat republican gov terry branstad 
abortion dominated recent debates in both races harkin and 
avenson support abortion rights while tauke and branstad both take 
antiabortion positions 
i dont think either set of debates got a great deal of 
flurry said roberts 
jim ruvolo chairman of the ohio democratic party agreed that 
the political debate cant break through the current concern about 
the middle east 
what people want to hear about is has war started yet and 
whats happening with the reserves he said 
right now he added people seem to be basically supportive of 
what bush is doing but with a lot of questions 
is there any sign that one party or the other will benefit from 
the crisis 
its too early to tell said ruvolo 
its really not been part of the senate campaigns said 
anita dunn communications director for the democratic senatorial 
campaign committee in terms of news coverage it makes it more 
difficult for challengers who are not part of a foreign policy 
story the way incumbents are she said her view reflecting the 
fact that in most cases the senators fighting the toughest 
challenges are democrats 
i dont know where it goes from here conceded rollins 
before the iraq move into kuwait rollins was hopeful that 
republicans would benefit from an antiincumbent mood that was 
starting to build fed by public unhappiness over the political 
ties between members of congress and operators of savings and loan 
institutions 
its awful hard to talk about savings and loans when youre on 
the verge of war he said 
john buckley who once worked for the gop campaign committee and 
now is a public relations executive said he sees no driving issues 
i get the sense its tough for people even to manufacture 
enthusiasm over this election because its an election based on not 
a single issue he said 
he called the sampl scandal a fingerpointing exercise in 
which neither party has an advantage 
any incumbent who has an ethical problem or has a real tie 
into the sampl problem is going to be hurt he said on the other 
hand he does not detect any widespread mood to throw all the 
rascals out 
whether the public starts paying attention or not the polls 
will open as scheduled on nov 6 and a handful of september 
primaries should settle the candidate lineups 
on tuesday florida democrats will decide the contest between 
former sen lawton chiles and rep bill nelson they are competing 
for the nomination to challenge republican gov bob martinez who 
is near the top of democratic lists of incumbent republicans 
the following week arizona republicans will decide whether to 
support former gov evan mechams comeback attempt or opt for 
millionaire land developer j fife symington other races decided 
that day will include democratic contests for nominations to 
challenge republican governors in new hampshire and rhode island 
later in the month massachusetts voters will settle 
gubernatorial primary battles in both parties picking the 
candidates bidding to succeed gov michael dukakis 
missing from this political season is much activity by likely 
1992 presidential candidates 
bush and vice president dan quayle plan a lot of fall 
campaigning but there is an unusual quietude on the democratic 
side 
sen lloyd bentsen of texas the 1988 democratic vice 
presidential nominee is campaigning for fellow democrats but 
disclaims any interest in a 1992 race 
other prominent democrats are on the 1990 ballot and claim they 
have no plans beyond their own reelection none appears to have 
more than token opposition they include gov mario cuomo of new 
york sens al gore of tennessee joseph biden of delaware bill 
bradley of new jersey and sam nunn of georgia 
led by democrats dianne feinstein of california and ann richards 
of texas there is a strong contingent of women on ballots in both 
parties feinstein and richards are running for governor other 
democratic women running for governor include joan finney of kansas 
and barbara roberts of oregon lt gov evelyn murphy is one of 
three democrats seeking the gubernatorial nomination in 
massachusetts 
republican candidates for governor include incumbent kay orr in 
nebraska and challengers barbara hafer in pennsylvania and mary 
mead in wyoming arliss sturgelewski is the gop nominee for 
governor of alaska where democratic incumbent steve cowper is not 
seeking reelection 
josie heath won the democratic nomination for the senate in 
colorado the large field of gop women running for the senate 
includes incumbent nancy kassebaum of kansas and three 
congresswomen rated as strong challengers to democratic senators 
they are lynn martin running against sen paul simon in illinois 
claudine schneider against sen claiborne pell of rhode island and

when saddam hussein sent troops across another 
nations borders a month ago today he did more than that 
he broke a spell his act seemed out of step with recent 
history or at least with the direction history seemed to be 
stumbling toward 
ordinary people were beginning to accept the notion that 
history in the fall of 1989 had made a monumental shift 
on nov 9 1989 people danced on top of the berlin wall what 
joy said a west berliner with their hands germans pulled 
chunks of mortar from the wall that had divided east from west for 
26 years 
they would have been shot dead if theyd done that a month 
before something had happened 
the thought took hold in those heady days that peace and 
peacefulness was possible anthony downs an expert on democracy 
at the brookings institution says americans were going on a peace 
binge and maybe were going overboard 
it was a great thing that the dictatorships had ended downs 
says we all got a big kick out of it but we were overly 
optimistic about the prospects for democracy in eastern europe 
theres going to be a period of chaos and even violence 
something like the same euphoria existed in april 1945 when 
nazi germany and imperial japan were on the verge of defeat fifty 
countries met in san francisco and agreed that henceforth disputes 
between nations would be settled by votes among members of 
something called the united nations 
but the cold war immobilized the united nations and the world 
got used to living with terror for 45 years the prospect of war 
with the soviet union seemed to touch everything 
the bulletin of atomic scientists took up the custom of printing 
a doomsday clock on its cover with every bleak crisis the 
hands were moved closer to midnight with every step toward 
disarmament some distance was put between them 
then came the revolutions of 1989 for whatever reasons mikhail 
gorbachev opened the window to reform and the structure of 
communism was exposed as a potemkin village all facade 
eastern europe captive nations in cold war jargon pulled 
out of orbit moscow acquiesced the soviets got out of 
afghanistan the cubans out of angola 
nicaraguans held an election and ended their war over a 10year 
period all of latin america shed its juntas and turned toward 
government by election the white south africans let nelson mandela 
out of prison and seemed willing to work on whiteblack coexistence 
in the most segregated society on earth 
it looked for a while that mankind had something going here not 
quite a lambsandlions sleepin but at least a tendency to stop 
the killing 
in washington francis fukuyama a state department policy 
planner touched off an intellectuals debate with an essay the 
end of history people took him to be saying that the great 
clashes of ideology were over the western idea had won ergo 
history was done 
evidently saddam hussein didnt read fukuyama he engaged in a 
decidedly oldfashioned enterprise the kind history is full of an 
invasion 
its been a splash of cold water on the national mood says 
m brewster smith of the university of california at santa cruz 
former president of the american psychiatric association as a 
psychologist id say our hopes might have been a little dreamy 
but he quickly adds i would not like to have people conclude 
that war in inevitable built into human nature id be unhappy if 
the result of all this is to quench that bit of hope that was 
beginning to become an effective political force 
and another psychiatrist ervin staub author of the roots of 
evil the origins of genocide and other group violence draws 
encouragement from the way the world has responded to saddam by 
ostracizing him rather than resort to arms the world has told 
the aggressor that his aggression is intolerable 
if the world succeeds this time and responds the same way next 
time then it becomes a little less likely that there will be 
another next time says staub 
from that he concludes that saddam notwithstanding there is 
still hope for hope

the birth and quick death of diana 
perkins has focused attention on the use of forceps in the delivery 
room a practice that can save a babys life or end it 
ronald loffredo a saratoga springs obstetrician was found 
negligent by state officials in nine of 12 births including 
dianas that he handled over three years in each case forceps 
were applied 
loffredo and his attorney are preparing to fight a lawsuit 
brought by dianas parents the only family to sue 
diana was born on may 20 1986 she died three days later 
loffredo was accused of failing to determine diana was too large 
for a vaginal delivery thus neglecting to perform a caesarean 
section he also was found negligent of failing to properly assess 
the babys position before using forceps administering a uterine 
stimulant in a potentially obstructed labor using excessive 
force in delivery and causing unnecessary birth trauma to mother 
and child 
loffredo no longer practices at saratoga hospital and the state 
board of regents which oversees medical licenses in july 
suspended his license for one year once the suspension runs out 
loffredo will be barred from delivering babies or performing 
gynecological surgery until he completes a retraining program 
in the fall of 1988 his admissions privileges were revoked by 
saratoga hospital after a 28yearold woman in his care died days 
after delivering a healthy baby 
he has generated support among some of his longtime patients 
who picketed the hospital and raised at least 50000 for his 
defense fund 
this has been ruinous absolutely ruinous loffredo said in 
an interview 
he defended his actions in the perkins case and criticized 
saratoga hospital for allowing itself to be goaded by the state 
health department loffredo said the hospital exonerated him after 
its own investigation of the perkins case but later was forced by 
the health department to review its findings 
none of the cases was brought about by patient complaints 
said loffredo who has sued the health department and saratoga 
hospital 
this process is being driven by a bureaucracy said 
loffredos attorney frederick killeen 
developed in 18thcentury europe obstetrical forceps have long 
been questioned doublebladed resembling hinged salad tongs 
forceps generally are used to speed up delivery if the mothers 
life is in danger or if the umbilical cord is wrapped around the 
babys neck they also can be used to rotate the babys head if it 
is turned away from the normal birth position 
the shallow steel or aluminum blades mold to the contours of the 
babys head and the birth canal but even for a doctor highly 
skilled in their use forceps can cause permanent injury to both 
patients experts acknowledge in some cases forceps have left 
permanent indentations on the skull as well as cuts and bruises 
around the newborns face ear and head 
actor sylvester stallones delivery by forceps severed a nerve 
on the left side of his face causing a noticeable slur in his 
speech 
in the perkins case it was alleged the forceps left bruises on 
the babys neck and one earlobe loffredo a softspoken man who 
built his practice in saratoga springs after training in forceps at 
rochester general hospital said the baby suffered minor 
scrapes but not enough to traumatize her 
according to the national center for health statistics in 
baltimore forceps accounted for 174 percent or 625000 of the 
36 million live births recorded in a 1980 survey no accurate 
records were kept before that said ken keppel spokesman for the 
agency 
however the frequency of forceps use has declined dramatically 
in most areas of the country partly because of high medical 
malpractice premiums said dr maurice drusin director of 
obstetrics at new york hospitalcornell medical center 
its been linked to all kinds of problems which have nothing 
to do with forceps at all said drusin an expert in highrisk 
deliveries 
loffredo 40 estimates he used forceps in 25 percent to 35 
percent of the 1500 births in his 10year practice 
david stewart executive director of the national association of 
parents and professionals for safe alternatives in childbirth 
charges some doctors dont have the patience to wait during long 
labors 
were not against any kind of technology when its used 
appropriately and for a good cause our organization objects when 
it becomes routine he said 
doctors are not trained to handle normal birth he said 
forceps is a piece of the whole pathological orientation doctors 
have 
a good midwife has alternative ways to handle a difficult 
birth a good midwife never uses forceps 
stewart and his missouribased organization believe the united 
states should replace 90 percent of its obstetricians with midwives 
thats utterly absurd to suggest obstetricians are impatient 
and use forceps to speed up deliveries said kate ruddon a 
spokeswoman for the american college of obstetricians and 
gynecologists in washington dc 
the data on infant mortality speaks for itself ruddon said 
citing figures that show the infant mortality rate fell from 47 per 
1000 live births in 1940 to 99 in 1987 
in february a west viriginia jury awarded a couple 1525 
million after they claimed their obstetrician failed to perform a 
caesarean section to prevent brain damage to their child instead 
using forceps causing a brain hemorrhage 
in anaheim calif dr charles wesley turner jr came under 
scrutiny for using forceps to hasten delivery of a girl so she 
could be displayed on national television as possibly his areas 
first newborn of the year 
a healthy sixpound 12ounce myra kristine palmer was 
officially delivered seconds after midnight quickly cleaned 
wrapped in a blanket stuffed into a christmas stocking and dashed 
to a religious service in a television studio next door 
we had the mother push at 1159 turner said i put the 
forceps on and pulled the infant out we had her at 15 seconds 
after midnight 
i used the forceps because i wanted to have the first baby of 
the new year said turner 
the california attorney generals office filed charges of gross 
negligence and incompetence against turner on aug 6 prosecutors 
want his license suspended or revoked 
the doctor and myras father gary palmer insist brigitte 
palmer went into labor prematurely and was sufficiently dilated to 
begin delivery 
there was nothing done that was wrong in this case he said 
turner 64 said he used forceps in more than 5000 of the more 
than 18000 babies he has delivered over 43 years 
palmer 27 whose wife and daughter have had no complications 
since the birth said he trusts turner who also delivered palmers 
first daughter 
hes doing his best palmer said id go to him for 
anything from the common cold to major surgery

in an age of shrinking forests people 
on the bering sea island of st george are trying to extend the 
forests frontier planting thousands of trees in a place where 
even one is a novelty 
the trees chances of survival are uncertain and some 
environmentalists fear that introducing them to a treeless area may 
harm existing species 
but scientists backing the project disagree as does anthony 
merculief president of the native corporation st george tanaq 
who suggested the idea to the alaska division of forestry 
id just like to see trees he said a lot of places have 
trees why shouldnt we have a few of our own i cant imagine 
anybody not liking trees 
recently officials with the state agency and the us forest 
service planted about 2500 sitka spruce chinese larch and 
lodgepole pine seedlings on land owned by the corporation on st 
george one of the pribilof islands about 225 miles north of the 
aleutians an additional thousand trees were left with villagers 
to plant 
the officials were joined by st georges 33 schoolchildren 
who along with their successors are charged with taking care of 
the trees and sending progress reports to state foresters 
many of them have never seen trees before although they see a 
lot of it on tv said beverly mierzejek who teaches kindergarten 
and first grade in the village of about 140 people 
theyre looking forward to seeing them grow they say well 
im going to be an old man before this things grown up our 
grandkids will get to play on them and we cant 
residents hope the trees will provide scenic beauty and also act 
as windbreaks around homes state and federal researchers plan to 
set up research plots to study trees at high latitudes 
each child was given one tree to plant at home a few hundred 
seedlings will be planted around the town and about 2000 are 
marked for garden cove a recreation area on the south side of the 
island that includes a rare freshwater stream 
about 100 more will be planted near an old russian orthodox 
shrine and another hundred or so at the site of an early 
settlement said bill beebe who is spearheading the project for 
the state forestry division 
we cant guarantee theyre going to have a big beautiful 
forest but we think most of the trees will do pretty well said 
beebe we were careful to pick the species with the best chances 
for survival 
the forest service is contributing about 5000 to the project 
from its urban forestry program the state paid about 500 for 
2000 larch trees the forest service paid about 90 for 500 pines 
and the rest of the trees were free beebe said 
the species were selected for hardiness in subarctic climates by 
john alden a tree geneticist at the forest services institute of 
northern forestry in fairbanks 
the st george project may be the largest in a string of efforts 
to plant trees in alaskas aleutian and pribilof islands alden 
said 
as early as 1805 russian fur traders tried planting a forest at 
what is now dutch harbor in the aleutians so they could have wood 
for ships fuel and homes he said about 24 trees were standing 
there in 1830 four survive now 
during world war ii the army planted thousands of seedlings on 
the aleutian island of adak to boost morale the forest now has 
33 trees none taller than 17 feet 
several years ago oregonbased retree international a 
nonprofit group dedicated to reforestation planted an unknown 
number of trees on st paul another pribilof island many were 
believed smothered by snow or blown away 
st george has one spruce tree although residents say its more 
of a shrub planted by an orthodox priest in the churchyard a dozen 
years ago it stands stunted and bent but alive 
alden estimates no more than 10 percent of the trees planted 
over the years in the aleutian islands have survived the cold 
temperatures and fierce wind 
the pribilofs home to one of the largest sea bird and seal 
concentrations in the northern hemisphere have a mean monthly 
growingseason temperature of 47 degrees alden said trees 
generally need a mean of 50 degrees to grow straight he said 
organizers say these trees might fare better than most however 
partly because of the selected species and partly because of the 
care they will get 
shelters will be constructed over the trees during their early 
years and some will be planted under tar paper to keep native 
grasses from crowding out seedlings 
arctic fox may try to eat the seedlings and reindeer may trample 
them but its too soon to know whether to take preventive 
measures beebe said 
they may have setbacks for a few years and many will gradually 
recover said alden they wont reach great height 
beebe has asked the alaska center for the environment for 
comment on the program the centers cliff ames doesnt know if the 
center will object to the plan and said it may not have much 
influence anyway because the trees will be planted on private land 
but we generally would oppose the introduction of exotic 
species because of the potential for environmental harm he said 
alden disagreed 
i dont know of a tree thats harmful he said and if any 
tree turns out to be harmful its easy enough to solve the 
problem you could do it with an axe the hard thing is to get them 
to grow

rats orbiting earth in the space shuttle 
need a nutritionally complete food that wont break down or allow 
flakes to weightlessly float around the module 
the national aeronautics and space administration had the 
technology for the food but the deadlines strict specifications 
and relatively small orders kept major manufacturers from taking on 
the project 
nasa turned to the american institute for baking in manhattan 
kan an industry and governmentsupported center for research and 
development of baked goods the institute turned to keith behnke a 
kansas state university food and feed researcher 
the university is to make a batch of 1500 bars for a flight 
tentatively scheduled for january 
one of behnkes specialties is extrusion which involves pumping 
dough into molds 
the rat food had to be in bars a little more than an inch wide 
about threequarters of an inch thick and 16 inches long they 
had this device built and then they went out to find somebody that 
would make the bar that would go into the device behnke said 
a wisconsin company made the vitamin and mineralfortified 
feed it is a mixture of wheat gluten soy protein and wheat flour 
that costs about 15 a pound 
when complete the bars have to be soft enough for a rat to gnaw 
and rubbery enough to stick together so small pieces dont get 
loose 
they look like an oddshaped gum eraser have a nutty aroma 
and taste pretty darn good said behnke 
the powdered food is made into a sticky dough with the addition 
of heat and water the dough is extruded into molds about 10feet 
long the molded bars are dried in trays until their moisture 
content is about 20 percent 
because the university doesnt have special rooms for such 
curing the bars are dried in an airconditioned classroom in the 
grain science department 
hundreds of bars are being fed to rat colonies on earth so they 
become accustomed to the dispenser and the food 
if the food is going to fly in space the bars have to be milled 
to exacting tolerances in the thousandthsofaninch range that 
milling takes about 15 minutes per bar and costs 45 an hour 
the space bars are sealed in plastic and irradiated for storage 
the finished bars cost 30 to 50 apiece according to various 
estimates 
that seems extraordinary compared to what you might feed a rat 
in a laboratory behnke said but theres been a tremendous 
effort to satisfy the conditions necessary for space

heart surgeon denton a cooley is best known for 
performing the worlds first successful artificial heart implant 
and the nations first successful heart transplant 
but he also has charted new medical business territory with 
packaged pricing at discounted rates for heart operations and 
cardiovascular treatment 
others are following his example 
the texas heart institute a research organization cooley 
founded in 1962 and the base for his sixmember heart surgery team 
signed its first contract with tenneco a houston oil company six 
years ago it has since negotiated 22 contracts with corporations 
and insurance companies 
cooley said his version of discount heart surgery has been 
inspired mostly by a desire to offer good affordable health care 
the medical directors of corporations and insurance companies 
need help evaluating care people are receiving cooley said i 
wanted to give them a package at a reasonable cost i wanted to 
help eliminate abuse from the health care system 
such deals also help cooley and others who contract out partly 
by keeping their operating rooms full 
if you do a high volume of heart surgery you can do it less 
expensively and you can do it better said jeff goldsmith a 
national health care adviser to the accounting firm ernst amp young 
packaged pricing helps fend off competition from the growing 
number of hospitals that do complicated procedures such as organ 
transplants for the companies the motivation for choosing 
recognized leaders is the old idea that practice makes perfect 
the mayo clinic in rochester minn known for its diagnostic 
capabilities sold its first package deal for organ transplants to 
the insurance company mutual of omaha

tired of hearing all those horror stories 
about plaque building up on your teeth gum disease or the high 
cost of keeping those pearly whites in shape 
chew on this the university of medicine and dentistry of new 
jersey has purchased a mechanical mouth the second in the nation 
that can simulate six months of human chewing in a single day 
devices such as the artificial mouth will help move dentistry 
swiftly into the future where lowcost highquality dental care 
will be at a premium said dr tk vaidyanathan director of the 
dental schools biodental materials laboratory 
it will help us develop materials that potentially can last 
longer and perform better vaidyanathan said 
vaidyanathan said the 267000 machine simulates the stress and 
strain human munching places on teeth the mouth can chew 20000 
times in two hours or about a month of human eating he said 
researchers also can flood the mouths artificial teeth with the 
chemical equivalent of saliva to determine corrosion and stain 
resistance of materials and they can also spray liquids as hot as 
coffee or as cold as ice cream to determine how the materials are 
affected by temperature changes 
researchers can check the results of the chewing and the liquid 
baths anytime during the test by calling up a threedimensional 
profile of the teeth on a computer screen officials said 
besides being quicker the machine is more reliable since human 
volunteers in research must be checked about every six months and 
many times patients do not come back 
the university of minnesota school of dentistry and material 
testing systems corp of minneapolis developed the first mechanical 
mouth six years ago the new jersey school bought its machine from 
the company 
vaidyanathan and other researchers are testing plastics 
ceramics and metal alloys for dentures crowns and bridges they 
are looking for more resilient materials that bond better with 
teeth to replace gold and amalgams of silver and mercury

murdoch magazines has canceled its appointment 
at the beauty parlor 
its plans to launch a commercially sponsored video service for 
hair salons has been supended indefinitely because of the weak 
advertising market an executive overseeing the project said 
wednesday 
the decision represents the most prominent setback to date in 
the recent scramble to create new media through which advertisers 
can reach narrowly targeted audiences 
recent ventures have included a commercial news show for teens 
in the classroom magazines and tv shows aimed at patients waiting 
to see their doctors and tv shows for people in the grocery 
checkout lane 
advertising experts say new ventures like these are most at risk 
as companies cut back on ad spending plans as the economy weakens 
murdoch magazines had announced plans for the video service it 
called the salon network last february saying it planned to have 
its halfhour program running on television sets in at least 3000 
beauty parlors this summer 
the response from the salons was encouraging said phillip 
cassidy director of special projects for murdoch magazines he 
said about 1500 salons had indicated a willingness to run the 
shows which were to be repeated eight times a day and would carry 
15 minutes of commercials each hour 
but he said the outlook for ad spending by some entire 
categories of advertisiers was so weak that the company decided to 
put the project on hold indefinitely it is not a good time to 
launch new media cassidy said 
advertisers were being asked to pay 30000 for a 30second ad 
that would have run eight times a day in each salon for a month 
the ads would have appeared in an entertainment program that 
included fashion and beauty features and other stories adapted for 
video from the pages of the companys magazines which include 
mirabella new woman and seventeen 
cassidy said the decision to suspend plans for the service was 
made in june although it wasnt publicized he said he plans to 
reevaluate the situation in about six months 
the move by murdoch magazines comes as whittle communications is 
set to launch a new magazine designed for beauty parlors and 
another media company communications venture group is overhauling 
its beauty parlor magazines 
whittle based in knoxville tenn is sending the premiere 
issue of its american style magazine into 140000 beauty parlors 
nationwide this week 
the oversized magazine published every other month has actress 
farrah fawcett on the cover stories on fashion beauty health and 
style topics the going rate for a full page is 150000 said 
publisher craige d johnson 
communications venture group meanwhile is consolidating its 
six editions of confetti magazine into a single edition starting 
this fall 
confetti debuted last march with six separate editions devoted 
to style leisure home relationships writing and personalities 
and came out with a second wave of those magazines in late may 
unlike the whittle plans to reach many thousands of salons the 
confetti magazines are distributed to only about 4000 beauty 
parlors located in department stores or malls where patrons are 
presumably going to shop as soon as their hair is done 
publisher david w smith said the company decided to consolidate 
into one edition because both advertisers and readers were confused 
with having six different issues each publishing cycle 
confetti slashed its fullpage ad rate for the single edition to 
9500 from the previous 35000 charge for a fullpage ad in all 
six editions 
johnson and smith conceded the ad climate has made it tougher 
for their new media ventures to sign advertisers but they each 
said they were confident their magazines would survive

tons of irish hamburger are stranded in turkey a 
french potato cooperative stands to lose 10 percent of its sales 
an english company stuck with four turbine generators that havent 
been paid for is cutting 650 jobs 
far from the persian gulf companies are feeling the sanctions 
imposed on iraq 
the crisis has come just as baghdads credit rating appeared to 
be recovering following the eightyear iraniraq war now 
according to several experts interviewed on condition of anonymity 
there seems little hope that iraq will soon repay its debts to 
western financiers 
iraq has the most debts of any middle east country up to 80 
billion by some estimates and japan germany france and italy 
standing to lose most if iraq defaults banking sources say 
iraqi debts once relatively modest rose quickly to finance the 
198088 war with iran according to banking experts 
very soon after the war broke out they went into significant 
default and loans from commercial banks virtually dried up 
said one british banker surcharges on some loans were as high as 
15 percent above the interest rate and iraqs debt spiraled out of 
control sources said 
after the war it was hoped iraqs finances would improve but 
the existing debt proved overwhelming 
the export credit guarantee department the british government 
body that insures loans to developing countries said it stopped 
covering deals with iraq in april when iraqi arrears started to 
mount 
it was this debt that helped bring on the invasion of oilrich 
kuwait 
saddam was getting in a difficult position there were 
expectations of a higher standard of living but at the same time he 
was stuck under a large debt with no signs of formal 
rescheduling said a british banker 
iraq refuses to join the paris club of debtor nations which 
sets up talks on multilateral rescheduling agreements also says 
one banker iraq does not hire western experts to advise it on 
debt theyre too proud for that he said 
on aug 1 an iraqi delegation visited rome for negotiations to 
reschedule 900 million in overdue commercial export credits 
guaranteed by the italian government iraq has refused to pay 
because an order of warships and helicopters was blocked by an 
italian arms embargo 
japanese trading and oil companies could lose more than 4 
billion in debts owed by iraq 
the trading companies had targeted the middle east as a big 
growth area for the next five years they were excited about 
rebuilding iran and iraq said alexander muroncew an 
analyst for jardine fleming securities ltd in tokyo 
the ultimate size of losses is unclear because japanese 
companies are reportedly taking steps to minimize losses such as 
withholding oil funds owed to iraq 
japan was not alone in wanting to cash in on the postwar 
reconstruction boom european companies also were jockeying for 
contracts right up to the invasion of kuwait 
nor are large multinational corporations the only victims of the 
crisis 
goodman international iraqs main irish beef supplier has a 
consignment of hamburger and steaks lying in a turkish warehouse 
according to a source close to the firm iraq owes it about 100 
million 
the money was being paid according to schedule but stopped as 
soon as this fracas started out there the source said 
at the nei parsons plant in northern england work has stopped 
on four turbine generators designed for iraqs al shemal power 
station and 650 jobs have been cut 
a cooperative of about 1000 potato farmers based at quimper 
brittany had a contract to deliver 15000 tons of seed potatoes 
the harvest has begun and if shipments dont begin soon the spuds 
worth about 8 million will rot 
iraq is the cooperatives main export customer accounting for 
10 percent of sales

the golden arch cafe serves up 
oldfashioned coke floats and salisbury steak platters no big macs 
or mcnuggets 
but mcdonalds corp is hoping this smalltown spinoff from the 
1950s will give the company a break in todays sluggish market for 
fast food 
mcdonalds is stepping back in time and possibly creeping 
toward a new franchise with a diner where you have to wait awhile 
for the food but you get an ambience 
with chromeglass decor neon lights spinseat counter stools 
cozy booths and a jukebox that blares 50s and 60s hits the cafe 
has been under secret development for two years targeted at 
communities with populations under 3000 it debuted in this small 
tennessee town last week 
lets just call it the cafe of the 90s said john 
charlesworth vice president for mcdonalds nashville region 
smalltown america is nostalgia this place feels good and this 
concept feels good to me 
aside from its name which draws upon the famed golden arches 
outside mcdonalds outlets there is little about the cafe to 
suggest it is owned by the same people who introduced the world to 
quarterpounders with cheese 
the typical menu fare includes a 299 salisbury steak platter 
with two vegetables 399 lasagna and coke floats in real glasses 
at 119 burgers and fries are there too but without the 
mcnames 
true patrons must place their orders at a counter similar to 
the fastfood system but afterward they find seats and cafe 
workers dressed in 1950sstyle bowling shirts serve them the food 
on ceramic plates 
i think its great said bob rickman 57 a local contractor 
lunching there during opening week hartsville needs it and i 
hope they need hartsville 
mcdonalds executives said the hartsville restaurant is the only 
one planned for now 
charlesworth said the town was chosen because it represents the 
model locale where such a restaurant could thrive a small town 
that cant generate enough business for a regular mcdonalds 
hartsville population 2674 is about 50 miles east of nashville 
this is an opportunity to go places we normally might not 
go charlesworth said 
the cafes premiere was news to some analysts and competitors 
who scrutinize everything mcdonalds does because it shapes trends 
in the industry 
sounds like a new jersey diner to me said joseph doyle a 
fastfood strategist at smith barney harris upham amp co in new 
york he said the concept puzzled him partly because its so 
limited if this thing works why would they keep it just in the 
small towns 
at least one mcdonalds rival wasnt impressed 
what youre going to have is a mcnightmare predicted john 
merritt spokesman for hardees food systems inc they are the 
masters at what they do well but when they get out of the coloring 
lines it doesnt work as well 
hardees calls itself the dominant fastfood restaurant in towns 
under 10000 the companys research shows customers go to 
fastfood restaurants in small towns for the same reasons as people 
in the city merritt said 
the cafes debut comes at a time of slow sales for mcdonalds 
which has unsettled some investors and industry experts because the 
company historically has been considered one of the countrys most 
successful businesses 
john maxwell jr a securities analyst who follows the business 
for wheat first butcher amp singer in richmond va said he wasnt 
surprised mcdonalds would try a new concept the company has been 
experimenting for years from breakfast to pizza to salad bars 
some have endured while others have been quietly dropped 
mcdonalds has tried about everything under the sun maxwell 
said the cafe concept may or may not signal a new direction for 
them

ibm next week will make one of its largest 
newproduct announcements ever unveiling powerful mainframe 
computers that will be its topoftheline machines this decade 
industry analysts say 
the success of the new computers is crucial to the worlds 
largest computer company because about half its profit comes from 
mainframe machines and associated software and equipment 
its a very major deal said jim cassell a vice president 
at gartner group inc a hightechnology research firm in stamford 
conn 
the new machines also are important to ibm from a prestige and 
competitive standpoint 
the two major makers of ibmcompatible mainframes hitachi data 
systems corp and amdahl corp both partly japaneseowned are 
planning major upgrades of their models in fact hitachi beat ibm 
to the punch announcing its nextgeneration mainframes in june 
hitachi and amdahl historically have undercut ibms prices and 
their share of the us mainframe market has been growing while 
ibms has slipped in recent years still ibm commands about 87 
percent of the us highend mainframe market according to 
computer intelligence a la jolla calif research firm 
the new highend ibm machines code named the summit line are 
expected to provide twice the computing power of ibms current 
topoftheline mainframes the 3090 series which debuted in 1985 
international business machines corp also is expected to 
announce replacement models for two of its lesspowerful mainframe 
lines 
ibm wont disclose details about the news conference it called 
for next wednesday but company spokesmen have compared its 
importance to the 1964 unveiling of ibms 360 mainframe line 
considered a milestone in the computer industry 
ibm has even rented a special amtrak train to take reporters 
from new york to the announcement site at its mainframe factory in 
poughkeepsie ny about 80 miles north 
mainframes typically are used by large corporations such as 
airlines and insurance companies they must be quick enough to 
provide instant information to telephone representatives and large 
enough to hold vast numbers of customer records 
the summit machines will feature fiberoptic lines to link the 
computers to datastorage devices analysts say fiberoptic lines 
which transmit information in beams of laser light can move data 
to the computers processor at about twice the rate of the standard 
electrical lines used on the 3090s helping speed processing 
the summit line initially will come in two versions one will 
have two linked processors that will calculate about 160 million 
instructions per second or mips said cassell the second version 
will have six linked processors and run at about 230 mips he said 
by contrast ibms current sixprocessor mainframe its most 
powerful machine runs at about 112 mips 
in addition ibm plans to provide the means to link several of 
the mainframes to act as one giant computer cassell said 
the summit announcement also is expected to feature a broader 
ibm plan to provide ways to link its mainframe computers with 
personal computers and other models to share computing capacity in 
a network cassell said 
while the summit represents a major advance analysts say the 
machines will face several hurdles 
in addition to competition from hitachi and amdahl the 
computers must buck a trend in corporations to rely less on 
mainframes and more on desktop models connected in a network 
as applications are migrated from the mainframe onto smaller 
platforms firms will no longer require the additional mips or 
capacity that summit promises to deliver predicts forrester 
research inc a hightech consulting firm in cambridge mass 
another problem is that summit models are not expected to be 
available until the second half of 1991 that lag could cause 
customers to defect to competitiors or postpone orders that would 
have gone to 3090s hurting ibms revenues 
we think thats going to be a difficult marketing exercise for 
ibm over the next 12 months said cassell a former ibm mainframe 
marketing executive 
to limit postponed orders ibm plans to announce an interim 
summit model that contains fiberoptic connections and other 
enhancements but uses the 3090 processor said rick martin an 
analyst at prudentialbache securities inc the machine later could 
be upgraded to full summit technology he said 
a successful summit launch is important for ibm because 
mainframes which cost millions of dollars represent one of the 
last highprofit computer lines analysts say 
profit margins on midsized and personal computers have shrunk 
as the machines have become standardized making them more like a 
commodity in which price not necessarily brand name is the 
determining factor in a purchasers mind 
however mainframes are not as important to ibm as they once 
were revenues from personal computers and midsized models have 
increased sharply over the past decade

despite the absence of two members opec 
held together through critical talks that resulted in allowing 
higher production to offset lost kuwaiti and iraqi crude during the 
persian gulf crisis 
the essential target was to save and keep opec said 
the cartels president sadek boussena i think we have achieved 
it 
boussena who is the algerian oil minister made his remarks 
wednesday after the 13nation organization of petroleum exporting 
countries authorized saudi arabia venezuela and others to produce 
as much extra oil as possible during the gulf standoff 
at least it shows opec is still capable of taking a 
decision said peter bogin associate director for oil markets at 
cambridge energy research associates in paris they did what they 
could if they had done less opec would have been something from a 
bygone era 
saudi arabia and venezuela friendly to us interests wanted 
to help offset the loss of about 4 million barrels a day of 
embargoed iraqi and kuwaiti oil the sanctions were imposed after 
baghdads occupation of fellow opec member kuwait 
saudi arabia had vowed to boost production with or without the 
cartels consent in response 10 of 11 ministers attending 
informal talks in vienna agreed to suspend temporarily the groups 
quota system to allow the output increases by nations with spare 
capacity 
opec last month set production at 225 million barrels per day 
for the rest of 1990 
iranian oil minister gholamreza aqazadeh protested that the 
western nations should do more to help themselves by opening up 
their stocks iraq and libya didnt attend the discussions but 
ministers felt the organization emerged intact from what could have 
been a bruising round of talks 
ecuadors oil minister diego tamariz said the new accord 
will help to maintain the unity of opec 
we have succeeded fairly well indonesian oil minister 
ginandjar kartasasmita said he said descriptions of the 
organization as an early victim of the gulf tensions were wrong 
with prospects for more oil crude prices plunged on the new 
york mercantile exchange futures prices for the benchmark us 
grade tumbled wednesday by 196 a barrel to 2592 they had 
soared last week above 32 a barrel a mark untouched since the 
mid1980s 
analysts predicted the injection of about 3 million barrels of 
opec crude into the world market could help hold down prices in the 
next few weeks but they cautioned prices could soar again with 
worries about gulf hostilities and rising demand for oil in the 
winter 
the market may pull back some but the trend continues to 
remain on the up side as long as the military option in the gulf 
remains a viable one said michael rothman an energy specialist 
at merrill lynch capital markets in new york 
bogin said gasoline prices at the pump should hold steady as 
long as crude prices do every dollar rise or decline in the 
price of a barrel of oil amounts to a 2cent to 5cent change in 
gasoline prices 
pump prices have risen by 23 cents to more than 130 a gallon 
for selfserve unleaded gasoline at us stations since aug 1 
according to the american automobile association 
the new opec accord was a delayed response to iraqs aug 2 
invasion of kuwait saudi arabia and venezuela had been rebuffed in 
an earlier request for an emergency meeting of all 13 opec nations 
instead boussena traveled to vienna for informal consultations 
beginning last sunday with anyone who wanted to talk to him their 
discussions led to the carefully worded statement that gave saudi 
arabia and venezuela the goahead to pump more oil

three former mai basic four inc workers 
accused of trading on inside information about the computer 
companys planned acquisition of prime computer inc have settled 
with federal regulators 
the securities and exchange commission said wednesday that dale 
t jabour ronald lee thurman and winston m cheong settled civil 
insider trading charges wednesday without admitting or denying any 
wrongdoing 
but cheong and thurmans attorney branded the action a 
travesty because the alleged illegal profits of his clients 
between 1875 and 3830 were miniscule 
jabour 36 of santa ana calif former director of accounting 
at mai basic was accused of buying prime call options in november 
1988 after overhearing two mai basic executives discuss the tustin 
calif companys negotiations to acquire prime 
federal securities law forbids company employees from trading on 
market sensitive information that they know or should know is 
confidential those who do are said to be violating their fiduciary 
duty to their employer 
prime based in natick mass was acquired in august 1989 by 
jh whitney amp co after mai basics hostile takeover bid was 
rebuffed 
jabour was accused of passing the information to thurman 37 of 
orange calif mais director of financial planning and cheong 
31 of costa mesa calif a staff business analyst they in turn 
also bought prime call options 
a call option is a right but not an obligation to buy 100 
shares of a security at a fixed price at a later date buying call 
options is a market strategy that allows an investor who thinks a 
companys stock is going to rise dramatically to make a profit on a 
small investment 
before the sec action jabour returned his 21800 in alleged 
illegal profits to the people who sold him their prime options as 
part of the settlement he also must pay another 21800 in fines 
he suffered a great deal he lost his job it cost him a lot 
and hes glad to have it behind him said jabours los angeles 
attorney james w mercer 
thurman will have to pay a total of 3750 in restitution and 
fines and cheong 7660 
both my clients settled because they couldnt afford the 
lengthy litigation said los angeles attorney robert c rosen 
who called the case a travesty 
although both of them settled they made such miniscule 
amounts he said my personal belief is that the sec should 
allocate its resources in other ways

four businessmen convicted in britains biggest 
financial scandal in decades shared a fatal flaw with some 
whitecollar lawbreakers in america they knew ivan boesky 
boesky the former arbitrager whose alleged lawbreaking set new 
standards for wall street corruption reportedly told us 
authorities about alleged illegal action at guinness plc after his 
1986 arrest 
a published report here gave new details about boeskys 
connection with the case which resulted this week in prison terms 
in an illegal scheme to help the brewery company take over a 
scottish drinks company one of the terms was longer than boeskys 
threeyear sentence 
boesky reportedly told police he was introduced to guinness by 
gerald ronson who was convicted monday with three others on 
charges including stock manipulation theft false accounting and 
destroying documents 
their trial centered on guinness attempt to artifically boost 
its share price during a takeover battle with the food group argyll 
for scottish liquor makers distillers co guinness 526 billion 
bid was successful 
former guinness chairman and chief executive ernest saunders was 
sentenced tuesday to five years and former stockbroker anthony 
parnes to 2 years for their part in the illegal share manipulation 
operation 
ronson was sentenced to one year in prison and given the biggest 
fine in british history 5 million pounds or 975 million for 
what the judge called an attack on the integrity of the market 
sentencing of millionaire financier sir jack lyons 74 was 
postponed until sept 25 after he recovers from surgery 
according to boesky ronson first contacted him about the 
distillers bid in early april 1986 and assured him that guinness 
would repay any losses incurred in the deal the independent 
newspaper reported tuesday 
the report said boesky later struck an deal with an american 
lawyer who served as a nonexecutive director of guinness that he 
would be reimbursed by guinness for losses on any share dealings 
connected with the bid 
he would also receive a monthly kickback fee of 5 percent on any 
sums invested acording to the newspaper which said its report was 
based on notes from an interview british police held with boesky in 
new york on nov 17 1987 
by april 19 1986 the day after guinness won control of 
distillers boesky had built up a holding of 14 million guinness 
shares at a cost of around 80 million the independent said 
according to the newspaper boesky told the american lawyer tom 
ward that he lost 30 million after investing 11 million in 
support of the distillers bid ward faces charges in britain 
stemming from the guinness case and has been fighting extradition 
after his october arrest in washington 
the newspaper said ward accepted the losses and suggested that 
guinness reward boesky by giving him a california vineyard or 
selling him property that had been undervalued 
but at boeskys suggestion guinness agreed against financial 
advice to invest 100 million dollars in boeskys limited 
partnership the independent said 
boeskys agreement to cooperate with us and british 
authorities reportedly included a promise that he would not be 
proesecuted in britain no charges have been brought against him in 
britain 
the newspaper said details of boeskys role in the guinness case 
were obtained from confidential documents not disclosed during 
the guinness trial 
boesky pleaded guilty to one felony count for lying to federal 
investigators and paid 100 million in penalties to settle the 
biggest insider trading case in us history he was released in 
april 4 after serving twothirds of his prison term 
saunders and three other britons are to stand trial later this 
year on further charges arising from the guinness affair

the japanese financial markets cheered the bank of 
japans decision today to raise its key discount lending rate to 6 
percent in a bid to curb inflation resulting from rising oil prices 
during the middle east crisis 
the announcement came one day after the central bank ruled out 
rumors in local media that a rate hike was imminent the increase 
in the discount rate from 525 percent is the second this year and 
fifth since may 1989 
the discount rate the interest charged by the central bank on 
its loans to commercial banks has a strong influence on other 
interest rates 
bank of japan governor yasushi mieno told a news conference that 
higher oil prices added to already worrisome domestic inflationary 
pressures prompting the central bank to act to slow inflation and 
stabilize the nations financial markets 
taking precautionary measures is very important for japan 
whose economic performance has such influence on the rest of the 
world mieno said we have to prevent domestic inflationary 
pressures from growing further in order not to disturb the world 
economy 
the tokyo stock exchanges 225issue nikkei stock average had 
plunged 457522 points or 15 percent since iraq invaded kuwait 
on aug 2 
higher rates are expected to slow business capital expenditures 
and cool economic growth and also generally discourage stock 
investments 
but stock traders reacted positively to the central bank action 
anyway 
the nikkei index rose 77517 points or 311 percent today to 
close at 2566996 the index had shed 81597 points on wednesday 
following media speculation about a possible rate increase 
yasuo miyakawa an analyst with sumitomo bank said the rate 
hike had already been factored into the market 
miyakawa said the higher discount rate may not be an immediate 
remedy for the economy but it could be psychologically effective 
in discouraging speculative trading in reaction to the recent surge 
in oil prices 
although higher oil prices will not start influencing consumer 
prices until october he said both the timing and the amount of 
increase was reasonable 
japan is seen as being particularly vulnerable to oil price 
hikes because it imports nearly all of its oil 
the rate hike also makes yendenoninated investments more 
attractive to foreigners by reducing the gap between japanese rates 
and those in other countries in the united states for instance 
the federal reserves discount rate is 7 percent 
shun ishihara chief of the japan committee for economic 
development a major business organization welcomed the rate hike 
the second this year following a march 20 increase to 525 percent 
the latest discount rate is appropriate to stem inflation 
because the middle east situation looks like it will last a long 
time he said in a statement 
however minister of international trade and industry kabun muto 
spoke out against the rate hike 
muto said the central bank should have waited to raise the 
discount rate because price increases had not been extreme 
the discount rate hike this time was the fifth in a series and 
the pace of their introduction has been rather quick therefore 
miti has thought the action should have been taken very 
carefully he said in a statement 
thursdays action was the fifth interest rate hike since may 31 
1989 when the bank raised its discount rate for the first time in 
two years lifting it to 325 percent from 25 percent

peering into a 21st century mirror the chicago 
board of trade sees itself with an electronic trading system that 
still has the immediacy of the handwaving and yelling in the pits 
it also sees new futures products new members and new capital 
those are some of the goals listed in a report released by the 
exchange wednesday 
as the world continues to change and competition in our 
markets increases the chicago board of trade will face many new 
challenges and opportunities said chairman william f oconnor 
as an institution we must be prepared to act boldly to meet the 
changes headon 
the report was prepared by a task force headed by robert s 
hamada deputy dean of the university of chicago business school 
it concluded that paperless trading is essential to the future 
of pit trading and recommended that the exchange pursue 
technologies that allow paperless trading 
the board of trade should use electronic systems that most 
closely duplicate the open outcry auction trading the study 
concluded the task force contended that the auction system adds to 
the liquidity of the market 
the board of trade is currently negotiating with its crosstown 
rival the chicago mercantile exchange to join in the globex 
trading system developed by the merc but the task force said that 
should not interfere with experimentation with the aurora trading 
system being developed by the cbot 
the report also said the cbot must pursue a diverse set of new 
futures because of the advantage of being first to launch a product 
and because of the intense competition in the futures industry 
the study noted that despite the introduction of a number of new 
trading products in recent years 51 percent of the exchanges 
volume comes from treasury bond futures 
the task force also recommended better incentive systems to 
attract members and capital to new products the study concluded 
that a mix of capital pools permits fee rebates and electronic 
trading systems should be developed and used to accomplish the goal 
also the current trading floor for financial futures is 
overcrowded and that the exchange should consider all alternatives 
in remedying the problem the study said 
the forwardlooking report comes as the exchange battles some 
presentday problems the board of trade and the mercantile 
exchange received a black eye when an investigation into illegal 
trading activity resulted in the indictment of 48 people 
the exchange is also faced with a desire by regulators in 
washington to increase federal oversight of the commodities 
industry industry leaders say that could reduce the 
competitiveness of us futures market at a time of increased 
foreign competition 
to meet the competition the task force recommended that the 
exchange delegate authority at all levels of its bureaucracy to 
allow it to make quicker and bolder decisions the study said such 
a move would allow the exchanges leaders to focus on broad policy 
issues and not on operational details

federal futures regulators have launched 
administrative actions against refco inc a chicago futures 
brokerage firm and one of its floor brokers 
the commodity futures trading commission said wednesday that 
refco settled without admitting or denying wrongdoing a 
sevencount administrative complaint at the same time it was 
issued and agreed to pay a 220000 fine 
also named in the complaint was ray e friedman of palm beach 
fla a refco principal and registered floor broker at the chicago 
mercantile exchange who did not settle the charges 
he faces penalties ranging from 100000 fines for each alleged 
violation to banishment from the industry if the cftc charges are 
proved 
mr friedman is not going to settle said his attorney 
ronald filler we deny the charges and we intend to vigorously 
defend against the alleged violations 
in an unrelated matter the cftc began administrative action 
against a soybean trader who pleaded guilty to improper trading 
practices after he was indicted last year in an fbi undercover 
operation at the chicago board of trade 
the complaint against refco alleged that for a year beginning in 
june 1988 friedman in an express or implied agreement or 
understanding with a refco customer violated merc limits on how 
many open contracts in pork belly futures could be traded by one 
person who is speculating rather than hedging 
a speculator trades commodity futures to profit from 
anticipating price movements while a hedger tries to minimize risk 
by taking offsetting positions in both the cash and futures markets 
refco also was charged with not maintaining written records of 
friedmans records failing to supervise him properly and violating 
two previous orders by the cftc to maintain better records and 
supervision 
we intend to enforce exchange speculator limits and we also 
intend to enforce cease and desist orders said dennis klejna 
the cftcs director of enforcement 
in addition to the 220000 civil penalty refco agreed to 
review its procedures for overseeing trading personnel and to 
submit a written report to the cftc with 120 days 
in the other action the cftc accused craig lacrosse of 
noncompetitive trading by helping another broker enter a false 
record of a customer order and by phony sales 
he was one of 45 traders at the cbot and merc indicted on 
fraudrelated charges last year last august lacrosse who pleaded 
guilty to two criminal counts admitted accepting an illegal

the prices of oil and petroleum products 
rebounded this morning as traders started thinking peace in the 
persian gulf was not as likely as it had seemed a day earlier 
several pieces of news from the middle east were throwing a 
little skepticism into the peace mood said brian tagler a 
broker with shearson lehman brothers inc 
in early trading on the new york mercantile exchange light 
sweet crude oil rose 108 per barrel to 27 for october delivery 
on wednesday crude had fallen about 2 per barrel as traders had 
responded to increased opec production and speculated on the 
possibility of a diplomatic solution to the oil crisis 
unleaded gasoline rose 453 cents to 8925 cents per gallon for 
september delivery by late morning home heating oil was up 336 
cents to 75 cents per gallon also on september contracts 
natural gas was up from 1505 to 1525 per 1000 cubic feet 
for october delivery other contract months were also up for the 
merc petroleum futures 
tagler said oil prices were back on the rise as traders 
responded to news that iraq was failing to proceed with its 
previously announced release of western hostages 
the delay by one day of a planned meeting between un 
generalsecretary javier perez de cuellar and iraqi foreign 
minister tariq aziz was also helping to quash any speculation about 
a peaceful solution to the crisis that began with iraqs invasion 
of neighboring kuwait on aug 2 
the two had planned to meet today in jordan but un officials 
in new york said today that the meeting would instead be held 
friday 
when oil prices tumbled on wednesday the market was responding 
in part to reports that the uniraqi meeting might feature an 
offer by iraqi leader saddam hussein to back off from his claim to 
kuwait but in an interview on cbs wednesday night saddam denied 
such reports

the us dollar rose against most major currencies 
in active european trading today 
gold also rose but trading was light 
most dollar activity resulted from the bank of japans decision 
to raise its discount rate to 6 percent from 525 percent london 
dealers said 
that prompted a surge of japanese yen buying and heavy german 
mark sales as investors unloaded marks to buy yen dollar buyers 
jumped into the market after the dollar rose through 15600 marks 
as a result of the move from mark to yen 
dealers said this gave the dollar a muchneeded boost only days 
after the us currency hit a postworld war ii low of 15385 marks 
on monday 
although the saber rattling has diminished between the united 
states and iraq over iraqs annexation of kuwait west german 
traders said they remain nervous 
the market could swing either way depending on the news from 
the middle east they said 
but some london dealers said the dollars newfound strength may 
be shortlived given the weak condition of the us economy 
in tokyo the dollar fell to a closing 14410 japanese yen from 
14435 yen at wednesdays close later in london it rose to 
14425 yen in early trading in the new york afternoon the dollar 
was quoted at 14437 yen 
in london the british pound fell to 19225f from 19475 late 
wednesday a pound fetched 19150 around midday in new york 
other late dollar rates in europe compared with late 
wednesdays levels were 15675 west german marks up from 15562 
12950 swiss francs up from 12740 52492 french francs up from 
52170 17645 dutch guilders up from 17525 116050 italian 
lire up from 115150 and 11455 canadian dollars up from 11385 
selected rates for the dollar in early afternoon in new york 
included 15695 german marks 130075 swiss francs 11465 
canadian dollars and 116300 italian lire 
zurich gold dealers said there was a feeling in the market that 
the gulf crisis could still worsen 
many investors still saw gold as a safe haven and this had 
helped to boost the metal after it opened in europe to around 385 
an ounce 
gold rose in london to a late bid price of 38960 a troy ounce 
from 38525 bid late wednesday 
in zurich the metal rose to a closing bid of 38905 from 
38425 late wednesday

already affected by the iraqi invasion of 
kuwait the us economy now could come under the influence of 
events unfolding in japan 
while some will see this latter event simply as additional 
evidence that the global economy is really here rather than just 
emerging others will view it primarily as still another dilemma 
for the federal reserve 
japan this week raised its discount rate a basic interest rate 
for the fifth time in just over a year putting it at more than 
double the 25 percent level that existed in may 1989 
an increase of that size could disrupt investments worldwide 
and many of those investments are japanese and as rates rise in 
their own country many japanese might be inclined to call their 
money back home 
much of that money is in united states investments attracted 
there by the safety factor but also of course because of the high 
returns us rates had been generally higher than those in japan 
and many other countries 
what should the fed do it could allow us rates to creep 
higher to compete with the japanese but to do so might be the 
cause of a us recession already close to recession the domestic 
economy needs lower not higher rates 
in fact a widespread impression existed here that the fed might 
ease a bit in order to avoid negative growth even slightly lower 
rates it was reasoned might spur enough economic activity to keep 
the expansion alive 
that was before iraq and kuwait however the iraqi invasion of 
kuwait hit the us economy right in its industrial gut by forcing 
up energy costs and higher energy costs can translate quickly into 
higher prices in general 
with the united states economy on the very edge of recession 
the fed could hardly afford to raise rates neither could it afford 
to ignore the threat of renewed inflation coming from the higher 
prices for imported oil 
the traditional federal reserve technique for dealing with 
inflation has been higher interest rates but that option seems to 
be denied it this time besides how could higher interest rates 
control prices set by foreigners 
the result has been a stalemate the fed has taken no 
substantial action to deal with higher prices nor perhaps can it 
that situation clearly was enough to deal with but now comes 
the japanese threat and similarly it leaves the fed without 
options will japanese money return home or in these insecure 
times stay where it is most secure 
the latter consideration is a genuine one although how much 
foreign money it involves is unknown it is known that big 
investors in europe and japan are willing to pay a price for 
security which the us market represents 
in a sense the current dilemma of the federal reserve does 
illustrate the existence of a global economy 
at least in the sense that more of the monetary decisions 
seem to be made abroad these days than at home leaving the federal 
reserve with fewer options than it used to have

postal service cancelling machines are supposed to check whether 
postage on a letter has a phosphorus coating but sometimes dont 
catch all bogus stamps on the 530 million pieces of mail processed 
daily shealy said 
this marks the second time trudeaus stamps have troubled the 
agency a sunday comic strip in may featured zonker harris in two 
sullen poses on drawings that resembled stamps both had us 
protest written above zonker and showed a value of minus5 cents 
one stamp said mad as heck and the other said ticked off 
postal officials said a few letters showed up with the drawings 
attached 
the drawings were protesting the postal services request for a 
5cent increase in the 25 cents postage rate 
we dont think for a minute that he is asking people to use 
these stamps as a replacement for a stamp shealy said he used 
his artistic license to protest and he chose to do it by using a 
postage stamp 
carol larson a spokeswoman for the postal services south 
jersey division said a postmaster called her last week to report 
finding a letter with one of the stamps 
mail with a bogus stamp is returned to the sender or is sent 
postage due if a return address is not on the envelope it also 
might wind up in the dead letter bin 
shealy said the postal service will investigate the use of bogus 
stamps which is illegal 
lee salem a spokesman for universal syndicate trudeaus agent 
and distributor of his comic strips said he could not reach 
trudeau for comment

a forest products company whose retirement fund 
lost more than 35 million in investment funds has filed a lawsuit 
against the limited partnership where the funds were placed 
the lawsuit was filed this week in us district court by 
weyerhaeuser co of tacoma wash weyerhaeuser claims its 
retirement fund lost the 35 million invested as a limited partner 
in hedged securites associates inc 
hedged securities lost more than 100 million earlier this month 
after allegedly taking excessive positions in options on ual corp 
while the holding company for united airlines was being considered 
as a takeover or buyout candidate 
partnership officials only last week revealed the massive losses 
to stunned investors 
the lawsuit alleges the partnerships manager james donahue 
said the options were covered to minimize risk but trading records 
indicate they were not 
according to the complaint donahue promised weyerhaeuser the 
partnership would hedge its investments but donahue instead sold 
off other investments late last year to invest more in ual stock 
hoping it would rise 
instead the stock price fell when an employee buyout of united 
fell through and donahue was unable to cover his position quickly 
enough the lawsuit claimed 
a donahue lawyer bob dill said hedged securities is likely to 
file for bankruptcy reorganization this week a move that could 
nullify the lawsuit 
on wednesday a state judge put off a hedged securities investor 
motion to force the partnership into receivership

grain and soybean futures prices closed lower 
thursday on the chicago board of trade as the market failed to 
take advantage of higher oil prices 
the market was pressured by nearperfect weather conditions in 
the midwest which is beneficial to the corn and soybean crops 
the national weather services six to 10day forecast out 
wednesday calls for warmer and dryer than normal conditions and 
its 30day outlook promises more of the same 
the good weather should accelerate crop maturity and the 
30day forecast should eliminate fears of an early frost said 
joel karlin an analyst with research department inc in chicago 
karlin said wheat prices were pressured by a lack of export 
demand he noted there are indications members of the european 
community is heavily subsidizing wheat 
the prices of european wheat are far below what we have 
he said the market will have to go lower to attract demand 
at the close wheat was 2 cents to 8 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in september at 267 a bushel corn was 2 
cents to 4 cents lower with september at 245 a bushel oats were 
2 cents to 3 cents lower with september at 101 a bushel

gannett co will consolidate its two newspaper 
divisions with gary watson as president of the new group 
effective oct 1 the company said thursday 
watson 45 a 21year veteran at gannett will oversee all of 
gannetts daily papers except usa today gannett is the nations 
largest newspaper chain with 137 daily and nondaily papers 
watson has been president of gannetts 60member community 
newspaper division since december 1985 the division will be 
combined with gannetts metropolitan newspaper group whose current 
president brian j donnelly will become executive vice president 
reporting to watson 
the washington post in thursdays editions said watsons 
promotion fueled rumors that he was being groomed to become 
president and chief operating officer of the arlington vabased 
media company 
mimi feller gannetts vice president for public affairs 
confirmed the promotion and the consolidation but denied the 
speculation that watson would become secondincommand to gannett 
chairmanpresident john j curley 
feller said the companys vice chairman and chief financial 
officer douglas h mccorkindale and usa today publisher cathleen 
p black would remain in those positions 
there have been no changes in cathy blacks or dougs 
positions and there are no additional changes coming up in 
garys position feller said 
watsons office said he was traveling and was not immediately 
available for comment 
watson according to the post told the newspaper on wednesday 
that the consolidation of the two divisions was partly in response 
to the increasingly tough environment for newspaper advertising 
gannetts newspaper revenue fell 2 percent in the second quarter 
compared with a year ago and was down 1 percent for the first six 
months of this year 
but feller said the post was off base when it implied that 
economics was the reason for the change she said the consolidation 
and promotion of watson just makes sense organizationally at 
this time 
she said gannett created the two newspaper divisions in 1985 
when we were making some larger acquisitions of papers but 
now weve found that it would be better to have it in one place 
you dont need to have the overlap 
she said the change would not mean any reductions in personnel 
its totally an administrative restructuring not a reduction 
in personnel or savings in costs she said noting that both 
divisions previously had been operating under one corporate staff 
the corporate staff stays the same the folks running the papers 
in the field stay the same 
watson started with gannett in 1969 at its rockford ill 
register star newspaper he held various editing and reporting jobs 
with the company and later was named president of its midwestern 
newspaper division and president of the cincinnati enquirer

it makes sense that this former first boston corp executive would 
want to set up his own mergers and acquisitions firm 
some of his colleagues might question the timing of his new 
venture now that the 80s takeover boom has all but dried up 
but duval who left first boston as a managing director in july 
says his duval group will focus on a new phase in mergers and 
acquisitions where the emphasis is on strategic deals that expand 
a companys business and market share here and abroad 
the dealmaker of the 80s was often criticized for being more 
interested in making a quick buck rather than improving the 
longterm health of a company 
in striking out on his own duval 52 is following a path 
forged two years ago by bruce wasserstein and joseph perella heads 
of first bostons prestigious mergers department who left to open 
their own mergers boutique 
and earlier this year eric gleacher head of mergers at morgan 
stanley amp co set up his own company gleacher recently announced 
he was forming a partnership with morgan grenfell plc the merchant 
banking company owned by deutsche bank group 
wasserstein and perella and gleacher have handled some big deals 
since they set up shop wasserella as some people call the pair 
worked on the 2453 billion rjr nabisco inc buyout and gleacher 
helped sew up conagra incs 134 billion purchase of beatrice co 
yet duval who doesnt exude the superconfident bravado one 
expects from an investment banker says he wont be that kind of 
dealmaker 
i have no illusions that im going to be able to put on the 
scoreboard the kind of deal that eric put on he said i cant 
put on the kind of deals that bruce and joe did right out of the 
block 
the essence of their strength is completely different from 
what i can do their strength is this reputation for being the 
consummate dealdoers i cant match that 
nonetheless duval believes he has the ability to cut a good 
deal 
the real skill is in what should be sold where is the market 
at what price should it be sold should it be bought does it make 
sense and then the negotiations to make the thing happen and i 
think those skills i do have he said in a recent interview 
he certainly is no stranger to the business at first boston he 
headed the companys real estate group and then was chosen to 
handle the firms merger with its londonbased affiliate 
financiere credit suissefirst boston 
even at first boston he sought some independence he wanted to 
remain head of the real estate division but was finally persuaded 
to take on the credit suisse deal 
duvals career path has not been that of your average wall 
street dealmaker theres no harvard mba on his resume and hes 
been in investment banking for just six years 
after graduating from georgetown university and getting a law 
degree in 1967 from the university of california at hastings 
duval whose father belonged to a san francisco law firm decided 
to take a more individual track 
i wanted to get the most opportunities the most risks and the 
most experience he said 
a friend suggested the government 
duval went to work in the department of transportation toward 
the end of the johnson administration 
when richard nixon became president he caught the eye of 
thentransportation secretary john volpe and was named by volpe to 
the white house team that arranged nixons visit to china in 1972 
duvals star continued to rise during the nixon years while the 
president was preoccupied with the watergate scandal duval was 
working with theneconomic adviser alan greenspan and thentreasury 
secretary william simon on the 1973 energy crisis 
after nixons resignation he served as a special counsel to 
gerald ford then on the transition to the carter administration 
by then duval wanted out of washingon 
i had enough he said describing his government work as 
literally living the twominute drill in complete and utter 
crisis for six years 
duval turned down the offer of a law partnership again showing 
his independent streak 
i wanted to get away and go in a completely different 
direction he said i wanted to run things and build things and 
not just be in the role of an adviser 
so in 1977 he went to work for mead corp a dayton ohio 
conglomerate and got a taste of the mergers business in 1978 
mead fought off an unwanted bid by occidental petroleum corp 
as meads chief strategic officer duval helped carry out a 
reorganization of the company that included negotiating the sale of 
about onethird of its assets experience that would serve him 
well when he went to first boston in 1984 
a conversation with duval who is lean and tall with graying 
hair is peppered with evidence of a wry sense of humor ask him 
where he went to school and he responds how far back do you 
want to go the nuns 
and musing about the phone calls and resumes hes been getting 
from people interested in working for him duval wondered if they 
werent really a vote of confidence in his idea 
maybe i havent gotten this thing wrong he said 
duval doesnt expect his company to be on line until january he 
said he expects to announce soon an affiliation with a financial 
institution that will work as a partner with his firm a setup 
similar to gleachers business 
he also is keeping his ties to the government duval serves on 
an advisory board at the pentagon and was named in may to a group 
that will counsel the securities and exchange commission on 
emerging markets in eastern europe

cbs officials have discussed the possibility of 
a latenight news series on the persian gulf crisis similar to 
those that led to abcs nightline the head of cbs news said 
thursday 
i wouldnt rule it out said eric ober but for the time 
being the network will only do latenight news specials and decide 
on a daily basis whether to air them said ober who became cbs 
news president only last week 
a latenight special aired wednesday night included excerpts of 
cbs anchorman dan rathers exclusive interview earlier that day of 
iraqi strongman saddam hussein whose aug 2 takeover of kuwait 
sparked the current gulf crisis 
another special was set for thursday night ober said again 
coanchored by lesley stahl and charles kuralt who did wednesdays 
program rather who taped his interview with saddam in bagdhad 
flew thursday to jordan cbs said 
if the specials are ordered and lead to a regular series that 
would emulate the process that spawned nightline during another 
middle east crisis 11 years ago 
that successful profitable show anchored by ted koppel 
acclaimed for his interviewing skills began as a series of 
latenight specials called america held hostage in 1979 
devoted to covering the crisis that began with the taking of 
american hostages in iran 
within a year it became a regular weeknight program that 
tackled a wide variety of subjects on aug 14 koppel became the 
first us network anchorman allowed into iraq since the persian 
gulf crisis began 
i wouldnt rule it out at all ober said again in discussing 
a similar series for cbs however its premature to say when 
and if a decision would be made 
cbs now runs repeats of wiseguy in its 1130 pm time 
period and would have to scrap its plans to start firstrun 
entertainment programming in january if that time period were given 
to the news division 
wiseguy draws lower ratings than nbcs perennial ratings 
champ the tonight show or nightline whose ac nielsen 
co ratings have exceeded those of tonight on some nights 
during the crisis or the syndicated arsenio hall show

the publisher of smart magazine said thursday he 
was near a final agreement to merge that general interest mens 
publication with an unpublished mens magazine that was being 
readied for launch next year 
publisher owen lipstein said he had agreed to buy the proposed 
magazine called men and would incorporate some of the ideas being 
considered for men into the 2yearold smart he declined to 
disclose the price 
in addition lipstein said the cofounders of men publisher 
christopher kimball and editor peter kaplan would join his new 
american magazine co 
he said all three of them had shaken hands on the deal but that 
legal documents would probably not be completed until the weekend 
new american magazine publishes mother earth news and psychology 
today as well as smart the company has been having severe 
financial problems but got a cash infusion earlier this month when 
a japanese media company bought a 50 percent interest in the 
operation 
the proposed merger of smart and men comes as a number of new or 
reworked magazines aimed at men are showing up on newstands 
murdoch magazines is launching mens life capital citiesabc 
incs fairchild group has merged its fashion magazine m with 
manhattan inc into a new magazine called m inc and conde nast 
publications inc has redesigned its nightlife magazine details 
the deal also comes amid one of the weakest periods for magazine 
advertising in years magazine ad pages were off 33 percent in the 
first half of 1990 compared with a year ago publishers information 
bureau reports 
lipstein has been looking for a new editor in chief for smart 
since smarts founding editor terry mcdonell disclosed two weeks 
ago he was leaving to become editor in chief at esquire the mens 
magazine owned by hearst corp 
in a telephone interview lipstein said kaplan would become 
editor in chief of smart which would retain its name and its 
literary mission while incorporating some of the serviceoriented 
ideas kaplan had for men 
kaplan was unavailable for comment 
kimball said he will become publications director for new 
american magazine with responsibilities for all three of its titles 
mother earth news and smart are published every other month 
psychology today hasnt been published since january but lipstein 
said it will resume publication in january 1991 
kimball said in a separate telephone interview that the deal 
would give him and kaplan access to much greater financial backing 
for a mens magazine than they had been able to arrange for men on 
their own 
kimball and kaplan had set up norris publishing in fairfield 
conn to create men magazine which kimball said would serve as a 
sort of handbook for men in the 20s and 30s kimball declined to 
disclose the sale price 
smart offers a bigger audience than had been envisioned for men 
lipstein said smarts circulation is 250000 kimball had said men 
would have a circulation of 100000 
lipstein said he probably could not have made the offer to buy 
men without the investment by his new japanese partner japanese 
independent communication co he has refused to disclose how much 
the japanese company paid for its interest in new american magazine 
but published reports have estimated it at between 85 million and 
18 million

accounts such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations 
of 100000 
in judging its monetary policy the fed has indicated it is 
monitoring the value of the dollar commodity prices and the 
difference between short and longterm interest rates it also has 
shifted its attention from m1 to the two broader money supply 
measures 
the annual growth rate in m2 so far this year is 44 percent 
which is within the feds target range of 3 percent to 7 percent 
the annual growth rate in m3 was 2 percent which is within the

oil prices settled higher thursday propelled by 
an early morning runup that focused on tensions instead of the 
possibility of peace in the middle east 
light sweet crude for october delivery closed up 85 cents at 
2677 per barrel on the new york mercantile exchange at one 
point crude had moved up to 2750 as traders began doubting there 
could be any immediate diplomatic resolution of the persian gulf 
crisis 
but a slight selloff took over later in the day after president 
bush praised the promise of higher opec production and indicated no 
immediate need to tap into the nations strategic crude reserves 
in the afternoon there was a bout of profittaking said 
annlouise hittle a senior oil analyst with shearson lehman 
brothers inc 
a day earlier oil dropped nearly 2 a barrel as speculators bet 
on a possible peaceful solution arising from a meeting between un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar and iraqi foreign 
minister tariq aziz traders learned thursday that the meeting had 
been postponed until friday and focused on tensions instead of 
diplomacy 
your general psychology changed said ed kevelson a trader 
with dean witter reynolds inc your news stories changed a bit 
as oil rose the stock market fell 
the dow jones industrial average which had gained more than 149 
points over the previous four sessions lost 3911 to close at 
259332 
other developments in the middle east including delays in 
iraqs promised release of hostages helped push up the price of 
oil and other energy futures threats of an oil workers strike in 
brazil also helped keep gasoline futures higher kevelson said 
unleaded gasoline rose 435 cents to 8907 cents per gallon on 
september contracts home heating oil for the same month was up 39 
cents to 7554 cents per gallon 
natural gas for october closed at 1537 per 1000 cubic feet 
up from 1505 on wednesday 
several analysts said wednesdays sharp decline in oil prices 
had been caused by some wishful thinking among traders who thought 
diplomacy might solve the oil crisis that began with iraqs 
invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
a renewed focus on the tensions in the gulf pushed petroleum 
futures markets to a strong opening on thursday but tensions 
became less of a focal point after bush gave his afternoon news 
conference said one trader for merrill lynch energy futures 
the rally was tempered by the presidents vocal support for 
increased production by opec members and his statement indicating 
no immediate need to tap into the us strategic petroleum reserve 
said the trader who did not want his name used 
opec oil ministers announced a day earlier that they would lift 
temporarily the cartels production quota of 225 million barrels a 
day allowing nations with plenty of oil to make up most of the 
shortfall caused by the international embargo of iraq and kuwait

892 percent 
the bank of japans decision to raise its discount rate to 6 
percent from 525 percent underscored some concerns about the 
federal reserves willingness to lower interest rates in this 
country

pessimistic about the economy that prompted concerns in the market 
that consumers might curtail their spending making an economic 
downturn selffulfilling

again after traders saw some cause for optimism earlier this week 
un secretary general javier perez de cuellar arrived in jordan

the midwest which is beneficial to the corn and soybean crops 
the national weather services six to 10day forecast out 
wednesday calls for warmer and dryer than normal conditions and 
its 30day outlook promises more of the same 
the good weather should accelerate crop maturity and the

demand he noted there are indications members of the european

the united states ran up a 9291 million 
deficit in trade with china and eastern european nations during the 
first quarter of 1990 in contrast with a surplus in the same period 
of 1989 the government reported thursday 
the deficit resulted from a drop of us exports from 32 
billion to 27 billion while imports grew from 28 billion to 
37 billion the international trade commission said 
a 134 percent decline in exports was due in large part to lower 
grain shipments to the soviet union and china at the same time a 
307 percent increase in imports came primarily from manufactured

venezuela ordered the stateowned oil 
monopoly petroleos de venezuela pdvsa to start placing extra 
petroleum on the market company president arturo sosa pietri said 
thursday 
he said pdvsa was ordered wednesday afternoon by the government 
to begin selling additional oil above the countrys opec quota of 
194 million barrels per day 
at a ceremony to celebrate the oil monopolys 15th anniversary 
he also hinted that venezuelas oil supply should be considered as 
an energy alternative to oil from the middle east 
industrialized nations will not tolerate again a growing 
dependence on middle east oil he said 
also thursday venezuelan president carlos andres perez called 
for foreign investment in venezuelan oil and said he would call a 
congressional session to review nationalization laws that keep oil 
firmly under government control 
we must think of the capacity of foreign and domestic capital 
to expand these petroleum industries especially in petrochemicals 
and oil refining perez said in a speech 
the order to sell more petroleum coincided with a decision by 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries to place more oil 
on the market to offset the loss caused by the embargo against oil 
from iraq and kuwait about 4 million barrels per day were lost 
after iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
sosa pietri told the associated press that brazil and spain will 
each receive 50000 barrels per day of venezuelas additional 
crude while india would receive 10000 barrels per day and the 
united states would receive 200000 barrels 
industry analysts estimate venezuela is now producing 100000 to 
150000 barrels above its quota authorities have said the country 
plans to sell up to 500000 barrels above its quota by the end of 
the year 
in an address he said the company plans to export nearly 25 
million barrels per day by 1993 that would bring venezuela oil 
income to 15 billion per year up from 11 billion estimated for 
this year 
the ongoing situation affirms venezuela as a sure and 
trustworthy oil supplier for industrial nations he said in a 
speech that presented venezuela as a possible energy alternative to 
middle east oil 
our clients will prefer our crudes or our refined products 
despite the fact that our oil is of a quality inferior to that of 
the middle east he said

brazils central bank president said 
thursday the country would not make any payment this year on 
overdue interest owed on its total foreign debt of 114 billion 
the only gesture we are disposed to make is to negotiate 
realistically with our creditors ibrahim eris said in an 
interview with foreign reporters 
brazil which some analysts say has been in a undeclared 
moratorium on debt payments for more than a year is late on 
payments of 6 billion to private banks and 2 billion to the 
socalled paris club composed of 10 industrialized countries with 
the greatest influence in the international monetary fund 
brazils total foreign debt is the largest in the third world 
eris said the moratorium and was inherited from the outgoing 
government by president fernando collor de mello who took office 
march 15 eris said collor was making attempting to resolve 
problems with lenders 
private creditors should not expect any payment this year 
because debt renegotiations would be slow he said late payments 
would be incorporated into an overall setllement iris said 
the government is now negotiating a letter of intentions with 
the imf the first step in reaching an accord that would allow 
brazil to receive 14 billion in new money imf approval also is 
necessary before negotiations can begin with private creditors 
eris said the letter had been delayed over fixing a target for 
public sector deficit but the basics have already been agreed 
to 
the government wants to sign an accord with the imf and then 
negotiate with private banks and the paris club he said 
the banks want to shorten the process and carry out parallel 
negotiations he said there is no deadline for signing a 
letter with the fund but in any case the government has no 
intentions of delaying negotiations with the banks 
brazil last week began a series of consultations with private 
banks to identify possibilities for debt reduction 
thirty of the countrys main lenders who hold 33 billion in 
loans to brazil were invited to attend the meetings ten said they 
would send representatives while the others will send written 
proposals

a judge hearing a recording industry payola 
trial suggested he may dismiss the case because the government 
improperly withheld from defense attorneys prior testimony of a key 
witness 
us district judge james ideman said it was clear to him that 
prosecutors violated a rule requiring disclosure before trial of 
witness statements that would tend to point toward a defendants 
innocence 
material that should have been turned over to the defense long 
ago was not turned over the judge said i have not decided yet 
what to do about this 
ideman said he would announce his ruling tuesday and asked 
lawyers for further briefs on the issue of the importance of the 
witness whose prior testimony was withheld 
he asked defense lawyers to waive a possible claim of double 
jeopardy in the event that he dismisses the case and his ruling is 
subsequently overturned by an appeals court 
attorneys for principal defendant joseph isgro and two 
codefendants agreed to the waiver 
the witness former internal revenue service agent dennis di 
ricco was convicted of tax conspiracy and obstruction of justice 
in san francisco in 1989 the defense discovered this week that di 
ricco had testified in his own defense giving statements that 
contradicted his testimony before a grand jury in the isgro case 
di ricco was not sent to prison because he agreed to cooperate 
at isgros trial 
defense attorney gerson horn brought the issue of withheld 
testimony to the judges attention wednesday 
prosecutors filed a brief with the judge attempting to explain 
why they did not notify the defense of di riccos testimony they 
said the transcript was reviewed very briefly by prosecutor william 
lynch who concluded it did not relate to di riccos upcoming 
testimony in the payola trial 
the government may have been under a mistaken belief that the 
transcript did not have to be turned over to the defense but it was 
not a intentional and conscious effort to hide evidence that may be 
helpful to the defense the government brief said it urged that 
the trial continue and di ricco be allowed to testify 
isgro faces 57 counts of payola racketeering and other charges 
prosecutors say he made cash and cocaine payments to radio stations 
in texas and california in return for playing certain songs 
also on trial are jeffrey monka and former columbia records 
executive raymond anderson 
horn who represents monka said he found 74 contradictions 
between di riccos trial testimony in san francisco and testimony 
he gave before the grand jury in los angeles this year in 
connection with the isgro case

bank of new england stock tumbled thursday after a 
congressional candidate said and the government later denied 
that federal regulators had recommended liquidating the struggling 
bank 
rumors of the institutions demise have circulated on wall 
street in recent days and gained impetus with the statement 
pushing bank of new englands share price down 62 cents to 1 on 
the new york stock exchange 
brokers and regulators repeatedly denied the rumors that the 
bank was about to be taken over which surfaced again wednesday 
analysts said such rumors are not uncommon before a long weekend 
but the rumors gained force after ted dimauro a democrat hoping 
to unseat rep richard neal dmass issued a statement in 
midafternoon casting doubt on the banks future 
this is a sad day for massachusetts as the fdic has 
recommended the liquidation of bank of new england the statement 
said dimauro accused neal a member of the house banking 
committee of ignorance in the matter 
the bank of new england is not regulated by the federal deposit 
insurance corp as a federally chartered institution its regulator 
is the comptroller of the currency 
late thursday dimauro apologized saying his news release was 
based on a financial wire service report and should have noted the 
report concerned speculation he said the rumors should not have 
been presented as fact 
dimauro also said his statement was released by an aide without 
his final approval i apologize to the bank of new england for 
any disservice to them he said 
but hours earlier banking officials scrambled to explain 
dimauros news release 
this release has been so weird that we are saying the bank 
will be open after the holiday said ellen stockdale a 
spokeswoman for the comptroller in washington it will still be 
the bank of new england on tuesday the press release is not true 
the problem is that irresponsiblity like this press release 
can kill a bank she said 
stockdale said the bank is solvent she said the office of the 
comptroller decides when a bank isnt solvent and the fdic would 
then be responsible for liquidation 
the bank also denied any takeover by regulators were open 
for business today and come next tuesday well still be open 
spokesman thomas lavelle said 
the banks chairman and chief executive lawrence k fish later 
issued a statement saying the surprising and harmful rumors that 
have been circulating about bank of new england during the last 
several days are completely untrue 
the facts are that we have been fully liquid since 
midjune operating expenses have been sharply reduced and our 
plans for a recapitalization are well advanced the statement 
said our recovery program is on track 
bank of new england has been operating under federal orders 
since early this year the bank came under heightened government 
scrutiny when a downturn in the economy and the real estate market 
exposed mountains of bad loans 
the bank aug 3 announced it had lost more than 30 million in 
the second quarter of 1990 following a 466 million firstquarter 
loss after a decline that began late last year the company lost 
more than 1 billion in 1989 
under an operating plan in conjunction with federal regulators 
the bank plans to sell off assets and slash its work force to 
reduce costs and raise money 
the bank did not comment specifically on dimauros news release 
and lavelle said it never comments on the activity of its stock 
the rumors about bank of new englands future began before the 
dimauro statement and the stock already was falling earlier in the 
day 
its been a distressed bank for some time and the continued 
deterioration in economic fundamentals in new england made their 
recovery that much more difficult said don kauth a bank analyst 
at first albany corp in new york 
kauth said rumors have surrounded the bank recently about a 
federal takeover which some analysts believe is inevitable 
the stocks been under a lot of heavy selling pressure because 
of the rumors said gerard cassidy a bank analyst with tucker 
anthony inc in portland maine 
if it turned out to be true it would be fairly significant 
he said it would show that for the bank and new england as a 
whole their problems have not disappeared it would be similar to 
the situation with texas banks

a federal judge has fined two box companies 
a total of 550000 for their role in a bidrigging and 
pricefixing scheme in six midwestern states 
us district judge nicholas walinski on wednesday fined general 
box co of meridian miss 500000 for violating the sherman 
antitrust act wisconsin box co of wausau wisc was fined 
50000 for violating the same law 
both companies which were indicted in march 1988 pleaded no 
contest in january and were found guilty each company could have 
been fined a maximum 1 million 
the fines ended a sixyear federal effort to investigate 
allegations of bid rigging and other illegal practices in the 
wirebound box industry 
a special federal grand jury was convened in toledo in 1984 to 
investigate allegations that some wirebound box makers engaged in a 
nationwide conspiracy to divide up markets and fix prices 
about a dozen companies were targets of the grand jurys 
fouryear investigation but general box and wisconsin box were the 
only two indicted 
the indictment charged that from as early as 1960 through march 
1984 the defendants engaged in a conspiracy to allocate customers 
for wirebound boxes in illinois indiana iowa michigan wisconsin 
and minnesota restraining interstate trade and commerce 
the indictment also charged that the companies conspired to 
submit collusive noncompetitive and rigged bids or quotations 
most of the acts listed in the indictment occurred long before 
march 1983 and thus could not be brought to trial under a fiveyear 
federal statute of limitations prosecutors said 
after the company was found guilty wisconsin box attorneys said 
it has lost money for years and shouldnt be penalized they also 
noted the companys cooperation in the case 
general box attorneys said that company also was having severe 
financial problems the company was based in toledo before its 
offices were moved to mississippi in 1985 it was sold two years 
later to a group of local investors

a federal appeals court ruled thursday that 
trans world airlines can prohibit broker sales and other transfers 
of frequent flyer discount coupons 
but the 9th us circuit court of appeals at least temporarily 
set back twa attempt to enforce the ban through an injunction and 
damages lawsuit against a company that buys unused coupons and 
sells them at cut rates 
the 30 ruling reversed decisions by a federal judge in los 
angeles that said the company american coupon exchange had 
violated twas economic rights and was forbidden to trade in twa 
coupons 
the court said twa had not presented conclusive evidence that it 
had been harmed by the brokers practices and would have to go to 
trial on that issue 
american coupon exchange based in newport beach since 1983 has 
bought airline customers extra coupons that entitle them to free 
trips after traveling a certain number of miles the coupons are 
resold at 30 percent to 70 percent below full fare 
some airlines do not restrict transfers of the coupons but twa 
in rules filed with the federal government prohibited its 
customers in 1983 from letting anyone else use their coupons under 
penalty of disqualification from the program 
the airline allowed transfers to relatives and legal dependents 
in 1986 and sued american coupon exchange in 1987 us district 
judge alicemarie stotler ruled in twas favor 
the judge declared its restrictions legal prohibited american 
coupon exchange from dealing in twa coupons and found that the 
broker had interfered with the airlines business relations the 
prohibition has been suspended during the appeal 
in an opinion by judge stephen reinhardt the appeals court 
agreed that twas restrictions were legal but reversed the other 
rulings saying they depended on disputed facts to be established 
at a trial 
in challenging twas policy american coupon exchange cited a 
longstanding legal rule that property may be freely transferred 
but the appeals court said the same rule does not apply to contract 
rights whose transfer can be restricted 
a plane ticket or a coupon entitling a customer to a ticket is a 
contract rather than property the court said 
reinhardt said the flaw in stotlers other orders was that no 
evidence had yet been presented that the couponselling program had 
harmed twa 
he rejected stotlers grounds for finding harm that the holder 
of a ticket from a coupon broker held a seat that otherwise would 
have been occupied by a legitimate frequent flyer or a 
fullfare passenger 
reinhardt it was hard to see how twa loses revenue when a 
frequent flyer decides to sell a coupon rather than using it he 
also said no evidence had been offered that couponholders on twa 
were displacing fullfare flyers 
a twa executive testified that the airline has confiscated more 
than 400 discount tickets that violated its restrictions in the 
last two years and that virtually all of those passengers had then 
bought fullfare tickets 
but reinhardt said those decisions were made at the last minute 
when it may have been too late to change travel plans and might 
have been different had travelers known of the restrictions earlier 
a lawyer for the coupon broker declined comment twas lawyer 
could not be reached

the walt disney co sued a former top movie 
executive thursday for allegedly trying to lure other disney 
employees and projects after the company released him from a 
contract 
the lawsuit says disney allowed david kirkpatrick out of his 
fiveyear contract as a gesture of goodwill in return he 
agreed not to offer jobs to disney employees for two years and not 
to exploit disney trade secrets it says kirkpatrick moved to 
paramount pictures corp 
but the lawsuit maintains kirkpatrick tried to hire away donald 
granger creative director of disneys touchstone pictures it also 
says he used inside information to try to bring the project the 
dead letter department to paramount disney had been negotiating 
for the project 
kirkpatrick former production president of walt disney pictures 
and touchstone maintains he broke no agreements after leaving 
disney last july for paramount where he had worked previously 
david vehemently denies these allegations and paramount is 100 
percent behind him his lawyer howard weitzman said 
fitzpatricks flight to paramount reversed a wellestablished 
trend the numbers of disney top brass who formerly worked at 
paramount are unusually large even for hollywood where executives 
and projects move between studios 
when jeffrey katzenberg left paramount in 1985 to become 
disneys overall studio chieftain he tried to take kirkpatrick 
with him paramount reportedly threatened to sue 
disneys lawsuit filed in state court in los angeles asks the 
court to stop kirkpatrick from luring away talent and projects and 
using disney inside information 
it seeks unspecified damages accusing kirkpatrick of breaking 
an agreement fraud unfair competition misappropriating trade 
secrets interfering with a contract and other wrongs 
the lawsuit says kirkpatrick told disney he wanted out in july 
but didnt say he was going to paramount 
kirkpatrick contended he should be allowed to take granger with 
him because grangers contract with disney had run out the lawsuit 
says it contends thats not the case under the release agreement 
in talking with katzenberg and touchstone pictures president 
david hoberman kirkpatrick continued to maintain there were 
loopholes allowing granger to depart the lawsuit says 
kirkpatrick has been production president for just 15 months he 
was said to have been granted an early release due to a clash in 
management style 
kirkpatrick had been a production executive with paramount for 
more than eight years and most recently was executive vice 
president of production until 1987 
he is now executive vice president of paramounts motion picture 
group trade newspaper reports indicated he was hired to curb 
production costs improve inhouse movie development and strengthen 
the management team 
disneys lawsuit notes that paramount sued kirkpatrick for 
breach of contract when he left the studio in 1987 to head up 
production for the nowmoribund weintraub entertainment group 
weintraub also employed granger 
the lawsuit was settled out of court with kirkpatrick and 
weintraub having to pay about 500000 the trade newspaper daily 
variety said 
kirkpatrick joined disney after leaving weintraub reuniting him 
with disney chairman michael eisner and katzenberg with whom he 
worked at paramount he joined paramounts story department in 1978
