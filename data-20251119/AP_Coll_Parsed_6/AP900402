the investigation of the deadly southeastern mail 
bombings continues like mad a civil rights leader says but 
with a much lower profile since the day agents searched a septic 
tank as tv cameras rolled 
the fbi wont say whether there have been any developments in 
the probe of the bombings that killed a federal judge and a civil 
rights attorney and there have been few signs of progress in the 
case now more than 100 days old 
theres nothing new here fbi spokesman carlos fernandez 
said recently in washington the investigation is ongoing but as 
far as any specifics no one can get into that 
hundreds of federal agents have participated in the 
investigation three men were subjected to extensive searches and 
media scrutiny but no one has been identified as a suspect 
naacp southeast regional director earl shinhoster who has 
received regular briefings on the case said he doesnt feel its 
near being solved 
my own view is theyre as close as they were in december 
said shinhoster but he said hes satisfied the government hasnt 
decreased its investigative effort 
they are on this case like mad he said 
the dec 1619 bombings killed 11th us circuit court of 
appeals judge robert s vance at his mountain brook ala home and 
savannah ga alderman robert robinson who had done legal work 
for the national advancement of colored people 
bombs were intercepted at the 11th circuit courthouse in atlanta 
and the naacp office in jacksonville fla 
followup letters indicated the motivation for the attacks was 
racism and threatened further violence 
shinhoster said the search for the typewriter used to write the 
letters continues to be a main focus of the investigation 
i think the person who finds that typewriter will be given 5 
million he joked 
fbi agents with reporters close behind swarmed over 
enterprise ala on jan 22 and searched property of the probes 
first apparent target junk shop owner robert wayne oferrell they 
apparently came up empty 
there still are some fbi agents in the small town said fbi 
spokesman doug marshall 
oferrell who wrote letters criticizing the appeals court after 
losing a workers compensation case is one of the three who have 
come under the most scrutiny 
the others are brian joseph fleming an enterprise print shop 
owner previously indicted on gunrunning charges with business ties 
to oferrell and walter leroy moody jr a selfemployed literary 
consultant from rex ga who was convicted in a 1972 bomb case 
oferrell said that since testifying before a grand jury in 
birmingham ala on march 6 he has had only one contact with 
authorities 
they returned some of my merchandise and paperwork they 
carried off he said tax papers stuff like that 
i just kind of assume theyll keep a low profile until they 
arrest someone and then theyll leave me alone he said

voters in this college town on monday 
approved a token 5 fine on abortion should the procedure be 
banned and a fivefold increase in the citys 5 marijuana penalty 
with all 63 precincts counted the abortion proposal declaring 
ann arbor a zone of reproductive freedom passed 15698 to 
8578 said deputy clerk yvonne carl 
the proposal to raise the fine for possessing marijuana from 5 
to 25 was approved 12901 to 11419 carl said 
local and statewide elections were scheduled for tuesday in 
three other states 
despite media attention surrounding the proposals carl said 
most residents were concerned about a 28 million bond proposal to 
fund landfills and launch a major recycling program in the city 
carl said 
thats the one that will affect our daily way of living she 
said the proposal passed 18866 to 5601 
about twice as many voters as usual turned out for municipal 
elections to cast ballots on 13 city council candidates for five 
seats and six proposals including the abortion rights and 
marijuana fine questions officials said 
the estimated 33 percent turnout was considerably higher than 
the citys normal election turnout of 15 percent to 18 percent 
said city clerk winifred northcross 
the abortion measure known as proposal c amends the citys 
charter by imposing a fine similar to a parking ticket should 
federal or state law ever restrict abortion who would pay the fine 
would depend on how the penalty was stated in the federal or state 
law 
the marijuana measure or proposal b was put on the ballot by 
the council the 5 fine for possession and sale of marijuana was 
adopted in 1972 and reinstated in 1974 after republicans repealed 
it 
opponents of the small fine said the minor penalty has created a 
perception of the city as being a haven for drugs 
carl said earlier it was difficult to predict how many of the 
25000 students at the university of michigan would vote but 
backers of the abortion provision counted on student support 
a good turnout means to us that well win and its up all over 
town said sabra briere coordinator of the effort to place the 
abortion measure on the ballot 
right to life of michigan has not opposed the provision 
concentrating on its statewide drive to gather signatures 
initiating a measure requiring that girls 17 and younger obtain a 
parents consent for abortion 
republican members of the ann arbor city council opposed the 
charter provision maintaining it will clutter up the charter and 
was designed to draw democratic voters to the polls to help elect 
democratic candidates 
the supreme court has already relegated this issue back to the 
states and thats where it belongs not on a local community 
level said ingrid sheldon a republican council member who 
describes herself as prochoice but against the provision 
in tuesdays races 
in missouri st louis county which does not include the 
city of st louis votes on a proposed increase in hotel and motel 
taxes kansas city mo voters consider a 189 monthly fee for 
curbside trash recycling

in the quiet of the morning when the sun 
peeks over the rolling farm fields the trek to the golden dome 
begins one by one businessmen arrive ready to start their day 
by sitting in silence 
there are oil brokers and engineers a toymaker too all are 
successful entrepreneurs and all are meditators 
thousands of souls have flocked to this meditation mecca home 
of maharishi international university to study share a lifestyle 
and build their own businesses a trend that has spawned 
prosperity and growth in an isolated patch of americas heartland 
it is a remarkable community says daniel dittemore head of 
the iowa product development corporation a statesponsored seed 
capital investment program they have an uncommon appetite and 
knack for entrepreneurship 
in the last several years scores of transcendental meditators 
have moved their companies to fairfield or begun new ones here 
theres an ice cream maker who markets to stores in new york 
chicago and other cities a chimney sweep supplier with thousands 
of customers a studio that photographs many of the countrys top 
marathons and a toymaker who produces the zube tube a hotselling 
cylinder touted as the ultimate cosmic sound machine 
othrs are engineers attorneys insurance agents or computer 
experts by one estimate there are about 20 computer companies 
thus the nickname silicorn valley 
theres a remarkable population of technologically oriented 
companies out of all proportion of what youd expect to find in a 
community that size said dittemore 
iowa gov terry branstad has dubbed fairfield a town of 11000 
one of the states economic superstars 
the local business chamber doesnt track the number of companies 
run or owned by meditators but some in the community claim such 
firms employ about 1000 people and more than 50 do business 
nationally or overseas 
weve put a lot of energy into this town a lot of money a 
lot of talent and a lot of job opportunities said john narducci 
president of chappell studiomarathon foto which photographs 
marathons and nearly a quartermillion graduates annually 
any small town in the midwest would like to have 2500 
people said jerry leahy a meditator who is board chairman of 
overland outfitters a familyowned outerwear firm with 11 stores 
nationwide it just isnt often you have them come in and bring 
their own jobs and bring their own payroll 
though meditators contribute to fairfields success theyre not 
the prime movers said mike brouwer executive vice president of 
the chamber of commerce which has about 400 members 
im not willing to slight 22 major manufacturers in this 
community some have been here over 100 years he said 
but he credits the meditators with creating innovative ways to 
support themselves 
some come because of the university others because the 
benefits seem to grow when youre meditating with other people 
said patty schneider public affairs chief at the college founded 
by the maharishi mahesh yogi the indian guru who once dazzled the 
beatles and other celebrities 
transcendental meditators believe if they gather in large 
numbers they create the maharishi effect a positive 
influence on events ranging from global conflicts to the rate of 
traffic deaths more than 7000 meditators gathered here in 1983 
for the taste of utopia 
each morning and afternoon meditators practice their technique 
in the golden domes of pure knowledge one for ladies one for 
gents to avoid distractions 
estimates of meditators range from 2000 to 3000 many attend 
or work at the university which moved from california in 1974 into 
the campus of defunct parsons college and has a fulltime 
enrollment of 799 meditators also run their own school for 
elementary and high school students 
male miu students often wear ties and jackets and jeans are 
discouraged 
the straitlaced appearance fits in well with midamerica and 
meditators work sidebyside with nonmeditators in businesses and 
the city council 
but theres still the dividing line between those people and 
some people in the community said royse huff president of the 
fairfield economic development association 
some things remain destined to stay separate such as the yogic 
flying competitions which prompted one enterprising company years 
ago to sell cushions to soften levitation landings 
yogic flying according to vedic tradition has three stages 
hopping usually crosslegged on a padded course hovering and 
flying we have been in the first stage quite a number of 
years mrs schneider says 
such happenings trigger jokes and the nickname the flying 
university 
brouwer doesnt mind i have such a thick skin over it over 
the years that it doesnt bother me because there are so many good 
things that come out of the relationship between miu and 
fairfield he said 
mayor bob rasmussen sees envy behind the tongueincheek teasing 
we dont have a lot of empty buildings valuation of houses 
has increased substantially he said they can make all the fun 
they want were doing just fine and thank you 
the town he added is not about to lose its identity im a 
strong believer we have enough of a solid base its not going 
to be a matter of them taking over the city he said 
but the mayor also noted attitudes have changed since the early 
days when some townsfolk wondered if the meditators were a cult or 
a religion 
theres certainly a stronger acceptance and less 
divisiveness he said theyve integrated much better we 
respect each other and get along 
iowans have a work ethic and a sense of clean living that we 
fit very well with as a group said rob glazier a meditator 
whose engineering firm has grown from four employees to 75 in three 
years 
some say acceptance just took time 
people in a town like this have been here three or four 
generations said bob daniels a meditator with a chimney sweep 
supply company they may want to take 10 years checking you out 
thats not bad 
glazier said oldline business leaders also realize were a 
larger economic force attracting outside capital 
indeed huff praises the meditators for demonstrating how 
business can be done internationally others say theyve added a 
cosmopolitan flavor to fairfield 
but problems remain while meditators are terrific promoters 
brouwer said theres a credibility gap they traditionally say 
things before they do things he said and market before the 
fact huff also said there has been a tremendous turnover of 
meditator businesses 
there have been legal troubles too the state sued a 
selfproclaimed millionaire maker after he failed to make 
refunds to 10000 consumers who bought his nodownpayment real 
estate courses advertised on tv a 35 million judgment was 
entered against him but he has filed for bankruptcy 
the meditators remain committed to their goal of creating heaven 
on earth 
were not quite as utopian the mayor responds when they 
say this is heaven i like fairfield but i like naples fla 
too

from the newly initiated quest to send people to 
mars to the decadesold search for a cure for cancer the 
governments science programs are a source of technological 
breakthroughs and national pride federal spending on science is 
far from the largest or fastestgrowing part of the budget but it 
is a favorite target for budgetcutters this is the first in a 
series of articles this year that will track the progress of one 
portion of the federal budget science spending 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
when the white houses chief science adviser 
visited the senate budget committee recently he spent much of his 
time responding to a single recurring complaint 
the panels chairman rep james sasser of tennessee said 
costly projects such as the space station 30 billion over several 
years shortchange other researchers and science students in favor 
of a highvisibility highmedia type operation 
the adviser d allan bromley countered that the expensive 
projects will benefit thousands of scientists and make possible 
scientific understanding of the world of our universe 
the dispute was left unresolved but it sums up a growing 
concern in todays era of relentless federal deficits that a 
burgeoning array of bigticket science programs threatens to crowd 
out a much larger number of less expensive but valuable efforts 
as part of his proposed 12 trillion budget for next year 
president bush wants to spend 68 billion on research and 
development or rampd the studies and experimentation that are at 
the core of science 
billions more spread throughout the budget and not totaled 
would be spent for scientific work that has progressed beyond the 
rampd stage such as the space shuttle 
more than 4 billion would be devoted to five science projects 
alone the space station a study of climatic change missions to 
the moon and mars a giant atom smasher called the superconducting 
super collider and a study of human genes 
investment in research and development is a top priority for 
an administration that believes in investing in the future 
bushs budget request said 
but with congressional work on the fiscal 1991 budget just 
beginning sasser and many of his colleagues are questioning 
whether the government can afford longterm costly initiatives that 
threaten to become more expensive each year 
exploring and uncovering the mysteries of the universe stirs 
us all sasser said but i am afraid we are looking at the 
stars right now from a rather deep fiscal hole 
federal spending on science is not large relative to the rest of 
the budget for example the military will take close to 300 
billion this year 
nor are federal science expenditures growing at an alarming 
rate compared to other accounts adjusted for inflation they are 
barely larger than in the late 1960s medicaid spending meanwhile 
is expected to grow by 15 percent to 40 billion this year alone 
but the grammrudman deficitreduction law is forcing congress 
and the white house to find new sources of savings every year 
making science vulnerable 
large parts of the budget such as social security are too 
politically sensitive to be cut dramatically nor can the 176 
billion in this years interest payments on the national debt be 
cut without causing the government to default 
despite pressure to reduce deficits many people argue that the 
united states cant afford to eliminate largescale science 
programs 
supporters make the same arguments that were heard in 1957 after 
the soviets launched their sputnik satellite the united states 
must remain at the forefront of technology and not just for 
economic reasons 
this country had a goal and a dream when we went to the moon 
what this country is looking for now is goals and dreams said 
robert roe dnj chairman of the house science space and 
technology committee 
one thing this country still has is an advantage in its 
science and technology base says frank press president of the 
national academy of sciences from that point of view the total 
investment in science is justifiable 
but others worry about the tradeoffs 
science is an unmet need but its competing against housing 
education the human side of the ledger says house budget 
committee chairman leon panetta dcalif 
still others complain that too many science spending decisions 
are made by politicians interested primarily in jobs and other 
economic rewards for their home districts 
its like everything else people are getting reelected by 
delivering the bacon says former sen william proxmire dwis 
who until 1989 chaired the senate appropriations subcommittee that 
oversees nasa spending 
congressional support for science is widespread and rarely 
breaks down along party lines but to generalize it has stronger 
backing from conservatives than from liberals who from time to 
time try to shift some science spending into social programs 
as with many areas of the budget support for specific projects 
tends to be strongest from those whose congressional committees 
oversee the programs or whose districts will benefit from them 
hence sen phil gramm rtexas one of congress most fervent 
advocates of spending cuts strongly supports the costly super 
collider because it is to be built in his state 
many who question federal support for expensive science programs 
say they soak up money that would be better spent for small 
projects that involve basic science that work often conducted by 
individual researchers involves a search for basic knowledge 
regardless of its potential application 
for example they note that this year for the first time in a 
decade the number of research awards by the national institutes of 
health will fall below 5000 
money also is scarce because of the way the government spends 
its research and development money of the 1990 64 billion total 
only 24 billion will be for civilian projects nearly twothirds 
40 billion will go to military work largely weapons testing 
with little or no application to the rest of the economy 
adding pressure are the peculiarities of the federal budget 
process which pits programs against each other 
the budget committees will make recommendations for spending 
levels that are politically influential but not legally binding 
the appropriations committees make the final decisions 
their subcommittees have jurisdiction over seemingly random 
groupings of programs it is at that level that dollars are 
distributed among competing demands 
rep robert traxler dmich chairs the appropriations 
subcommittee that oversees nasa the national science foundation 
housing veterans and environmental programs 
what am i supposed to do for science he asked take money 
from the homeless

jockeying for federal science dollars is 
intensifying as demands increase but the money available remains 
roughly constant 
when inflation is considered the government spends barely more 
for research and development today than it did at the height of the 
apollo moon program in the late 1960s 
adding to the competition is the sheer number of participants 
involved in distribution and pursuit of science funding dozens of 
congressional committees and federal agencies thousands of private 
companies and institutions and an estimated 53 million american 
scientists and engineers 
when world war ii ended the government was spending less than 
1 billion annually on research and development most of it for 
atomic weapons work spending grew slowly until the soviets orbited 
the sputnik satellite in 1957 provoking concern about the 
competitiveness of american science and sparking the growth of the 
us space program 
as a result government science spending grew well into the 
1960s leveling off during the vietnam war dollar amounts 
increased with the energy crisis of the late 1970s and president 
reagans defense buildup of the 1980s but spending adjusted for 
inflation changed little 
president bush is proposing 68 billion in science spending for 
the next fiscal year up about 4 billion from this year 
translated into 1982 dollars to even out the effects of 
inflation the government will spend the equivalent of 482 
billion this year for research and development barely more than 
the 46 billion it spent in 1967 
but nearly twothirds of the spending goes for military 
research mainly on weapons making the competition for civilian 
research and development money even more intense 
again using 1982 dollars the government will spend 181 
billion on civilian research and development in 1990 less than 
the 224 billion spent in 1966 
today 26 house and senate committees are involved in science 
policy and spending ninetysix federal agencies and agency 
subdivisions play a role in research and development according to 
the national science foundation 
but just five agencies spend 95 percent of the money the 
pentagon the department of health and human services the energy 
department the national aeronautics and space administration and 
the national science foundation which distributes grants and keeps 
track of federal science efforts 
in 1988 15 agencies accounted for more than 99 percent of 
federal academic support for science they distributed money to 
2769 universities and colleges 46 offices of academic systems 
such as state university headquarters and 717 nonprofit 
independent institutions such as hospitals 
to conduct its own scientific work ranging from the study of 
aids to development of highspeed trains the government employs 
218000 scientists and engineers according to the science 
foundation 
some work at the more than 700 national laboratories the 
government either operates directly or pays other institutions to 
run on the large end of the scale are the 8400 employees at the 
sandia national laboratories in albuquerque nm and livermore 
calif at the other extreme are the 16 workers at the kodiak 
national laboratory in kodiak alaska where shellfish are studied 
in his proposed 1991 budget president bush is pressing for 
annual installments for a number of major scientific initiatives 
that will take years to complete 
six of the biggest and their projected overall costs are 
a 3 billion effort to map human genes in an effort to treat 
genetic diseases and advance agriculture medicine and other fields 
the 8 billion super collider a circular atomsmasher that 
will measure 54 miles around about to be built in texas it will 
be the worlds most expensive scientific instrument 
the socalled mission to planet earth involving nasa and other 
agencies to study global change at a cost of at least 20 billion 
over 20 years 
the 30 billion space station scheduled for construction in 
the mid1990s 
a return by astronauts to the moon in the 1990s and a manned 
mission to mars early in the next century which nasa says could 
cost 541 billion 
the aerospace plane considered part of the moonmars effort 
but which could be developed independently it would take off and 
land like a conventional airplane yet reach speeds above 4000 mph 
if approved construction of two aircraft would begin in 1993 take 
four to five years and cost more than 5 billion

distant from manhattans shining skyscrapers 
lies the darker side of new york city real estate a place where 
buildings crumble from neglect where drugs are dealt where 
unlicensed bars sometimes turn into infernos 
the happy land social club in the bronx where 87 revelers were 
killed march 25 in new york citys deadliest fire in 79 years was 
a firetrap like hundreds of other illegal clubs in poorer 
neighborhoods and the city knew it 
but these bars are as profitable as they are dangerous experts 
say and that is why they flourish in the shadows poorly 
regulated operated on the cheap tolerated by landlords seeking 
what cash they can find 
you own a building you cant rent it all of a sudden a guy 
comes along and offers you 2000 a month for it said barry 
levites a real estate manager and former president of the bronx 
boroughs board of realtors ninety percent of the time nobody 
even asks what he wants it for 
that passes for a business ethic on the unglamorous side of the 
block 
there is a tendency to find things that you dont expect 
from tenants said morris sopher a bronx owner listed as having 
two illegal social clubs in his buildings they may open a 
grocery store up front but then they make a partition 40 feet back 
and they start having gatherings 
say i rent to a guy and he starts doing illegal things said 
james j houlihan another real estate owner with some holdings in 
poorer areas how am i supposed to be responsible for it 
but some landlords may share the blame while some clubs are 
concealed many illegal nightspots operate openly with a sign out 
front and music blaring some are centers of drug traffic 
prostitutes frequent others 
a lot of landlords will rent to unsavory characters without 
getting directly involved without wanting to know whats going on 
making a lot of money and opening their eyes only when the police 
come along said douglas kellner a veteran tenant rights lawyer 
then they selfrighteously take steps to clean it up 
he said landlords in poor neighborhoods include slumlords who 
collect what rental cash they can while allowing buildings to 
deteriorate smalltime owners unschooled in building management 
and real estate companies that provide minimum service while 
seeking the maximum profit 
perhaps the biggest owner is the city which takes over 
buildings for unpaid taxes police records say social clubs operate 
even in some cityowned buildings by one estimate more than 50 
in some cases where private owners remain the rents are 
extortionate said jane benedict a leader of the metropolitan 
council on housing a tenant rights group but theres no place 
else for the people to go the city does not regulate commercial 
rents 
the happy land rented for 1950 a month easy money to recover 
in a club charging a 5 entrance fee and 3 per drink to maximize 
profit many clubs pour cheap booze from refilled bottles 
anybody who thinks that because a bottle says dewars hes 
getting dewars ought to go to the hospital for a mental 
examination said inspector frank biehler commander of the 
police departments social club task force 
the happy land lacked a fire exit and firstfloor sprinkler 
system once flames blocked the front door there was no way out 
the city ordered the club closed in november 1988 for fire code 
violations and it apparently closed for a time but then reopened 
the city said it sent its vacate order to the buildings owner 
alex dilorenzo iii and that a firefighter discussed the issue with 
morris jaffe a real estate manager who leased a block of buildings 
including the happy land from dilorenzo lawyers for dilorenzo and 
jaffe did not return calls 
dilorenzo is part heir to one of the citys largest real estate 
fortunes 
levites the real estate manager called it unusual for someone 
of dilorenzos prominence to own property in impoverished areas 
they can play the big game in manhattan he said why bother 
with something like this 
more common are owners such as sopher who said he owns nearly 
60 bronx commercial buildings and others who own just one or 
several properties 
sopher said he never was notified by the city that it had found 
illegal clubs in two of his buildings and that he learned of it 
only last week when reporters called he said he would move to 
evict them but complained that court protections for tenants can 
delay evictions a year or more 
my responsibility is to come around which i do bother them 
harass them i dont have any police powers i can go to court but 
the courts are totally consumer and tenant oriented he said 
its almost impossible to get out a bad tenant 
sopher and his colleague also laid some of the blame for illegal 
clubs on the city which they said failed to enforce the vacate 
orders that help rid them of unwanted tenants inspectors rarely 
return they said police and firefighters never check up 
happy land had a sign in front complete with a smiling happy 
face symbol youre going to tell me the cops in the area 
didnt know this was going on levites said the fire 
department didnt know what was going on they didnt notice 
whos supposed to police these people well the blame can go 
all over

they are an unlikely group of backroom 
politicians the rabbi of belz the rabbi of gur and the venerable 
litvak 93yearold rabbi eliezer menachem schach 
israels political system is tangled and these three leaders of 
the haredim ultraorthodox jews have the power to decide who 
will lead the next government 
although israel is a jewish state rabbis seldom emerge as 
political kingmakers outrage has been the most common reaction 
among israelis who are overwhelmingly secular 
thousands of israelis tuned in to a televised speech last week 
by rabbi schach a leader in two ultraorthodox parties 
his factions and agudat israel the third ultrareligious party 
hold a pivotal 13 seats in the 120member parliament they can 
determine whether shimon peres the labor party leader is able to 
form a new coalition 
religious party leaders said for a week that schachs speech 
would be a political bombshell and break the parliamentary tie 
between labor and the rightwing likud bloc of yitzhak shamir 
acting prime minister of a caretaker government 
it was a political dud however more of a sermon in which the 
whitebearded rabbi wearing the black hat of religious jews 
literally wagged his finger and lectured israel for ignoring jewish 
traditions 
many were angered by his criticism of the kibbutzim or 
collective farms which led in the settlement of israel and in 
fighting its wars 
schach accused the kibbutzim of raising nonkosher pigs and 
rabbits and of forgetting traditions that have kept jews together 
for 2000 years if there is a war with what will they fight 
he asked 
much of the resentment stemmed from the fact that many 
ultraorthodox are nonzionist and do not accept the state of 
israel their children often avoid army service studying religion 
into their late 20s or early 30s in yeshivas 
i propose to whomever wants to look at the rabbits in the 
kibbutzim that they also look at the cemeteries and count there how 
many kibbutzniks were killed in the wars said raphael eitan a 
former army chief of staff and rightwing politician 
yossi sarid head of the leftwing citizens rights movement 
said i ask if there is somebody among us who in the next war 
will do without the boys from the kibbutz and instead send the 
yeshiva students 
schach criticized the centerleft labor party for its 
detachment from jewish tradition and included likud its 
conservative rival in all the others that have no link to 
judaism 
the lack of a clear endorsement meant politicians on both sides 
continued wooing the ultraorthodox parties offering political 
jobs and funds for yeshivas as enticements and feeding the anger 
of many israelis 
parliament member yigal bibi of the national religious party 
which is not ultraorthodox described the events as a sad moment 
in the life of israel 
the people have had enough he said its as if weve 
returned to the 18th century the war of the lithuanians and 
the hassidim has gone beyond any limit 
bibi referred to the dispute between the hassidim hebrew for 
pietists who arose in poland and the mitnaggedim or 
opponents who originated in lithuania 
agudat israel is a base for the hassidim who stress the 
emotional side of judaism rabbi simha alter who lives in israel 
but has the title rabbi of gur in the ukraine is one of its 
leaders 
rabbi schach is a litvak or native of lithuania he is of the 
mitnaggedim sect which was formed in reaction to the hassidim and 
emphasizes talmudic scholarship 
in his battle with agudat the rabbi helped create shas and 
degel hatorah the two political groups he represents his chief 
ally in degel hatorah or torah flag is rabbi dov rokeach who has 
the title rabbi of belz in the ukraine 
at the moment the ancient and modern disputes of the 
ultraorthodox keep peres from lining up the 61 parliament votes he 
needs to form a government 
because peres has a tentative promise of agudats five votes he 
is unlikely to get the support of the eight members who represent 
shas and degel hatorah 
the irony of it is that schach would seem labors natural ally 
in his televised speech the rabbi expressed willingness to give 
up the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip in return for 
peace with the palestinians who live there a view labor shares and 
likud rejects 
one of schachs allies rabbi ovadia yosef brought down 
shamirs government march 15 yosef withdrew his backing from

highdefinition television widely held to be the 
next wave in video technology is coming it wont be cheap and 
it wont be here soon but people at the nations big broadcasting 
convention want to catch the hdtv wave 
hdtv is real its coming and its important for broadcasters 
to focus on gary shapiro of the electronics industry association 
told a roomful of broadcasters at national association of 
broadcasters convention 
manufacturers prototypes showed conventioneers the sharpfocus 
widescreen format of the movie theater and the compact 
discquality sound but bringing that technological wizardry home 
isnt going to be easy 
the federal communications commission must decide by 1993 which 
of several competing technical proposals will best transmit hdtv 
and whether the nation should settle for a cheaper sortof 
highdefinition tv 
tv and video producers also have to crank out hdtv programs and 
tv networks local stations paytv services and cable companies 
must decide how quickly they can upgrade their equipment to carry 
hdtv signals 
and viewers must decide whether they can afford it right now 
sonys 28inch hdtv color monitor costs about 30000 experts 
think the initial price for the first consumer models will be about 
3000 
that 3000 price point seems high but of course it will 
come down shapiro said its time for broadcasters not to 
break into hives when we talk about it 
as am radio was eclipsed by fm stereo he said the failure to 
get involved in hdtv could turn overtheair broadcast into what am 
radio is now 
the cost of converting an entire tv station or a network 
scares some industry observers who label hdtv huge debt tv 
one study estimates that it could cost a majormarket tv station 
38 million to make the switch 
converting a network of studios and equipment could cost half a 
billion dollars said michael j sherlock president of operations 
and technical services for nbc 
hdtv signals cannot simply be sent in place of the current 
standard to ensure that tv sets dont turn obsolete overnight the 
fcc has determined that current tv transmission must continue 
hdtv broadcasters will have to simulcast a separate 
highdefinition signal on a second tv channel which hdtv viewers 
will turn to instead 
the simulcast system means every tv station showing hdtv will 
need a new antenna and some may need new towers at a time when 
many urban areas dont want any more of them 
it all means a lot of money maybe too much according to 
sherlock we think its real important to be able to have 
something thats costeffective for the consumer and the 
broadcaster too he said 
in addition to five simulcast hdtv proposals the fcc is 
weighing three proposals for enhanced systems sometimes dubbed 
extended definition or edtv 
these systems are designed to improve current tv transmission by 
30 percent or more with more than 400 lines of resolution 
compared to the old system which peaks in the 300s the signal 
could be received by conventional tvs and wouldnt require a 
second transmission channel 
hdtv puts more than 1000 lines of resolution on the tv screen 
but the advanced television research consortium which matches 
nbc with the us arms of frances thomson sa and the dutch nv 
philips is pushing hard for its extended definition system dubbed 
advanced compatible television 
it would not require the second simulcast system and thus would 
cost broadcasters and consumers much less and could be up and 
running a lot faster 
thomsons rca prototype edtv set also was on display showing 
super bowl highlights taped in extended definition 
the fcc announced that it has no intention of adopting a midway 
standard now and an hdtv standard later it could still 
conceivably approve one of each

when genghis khans mongol warriors 
swept south in the 13th century even chinas great wall could not 
keep them out 
again china is on guard against mongolia but the new forces of 
democracy and nationalism bursting forth may prove just as hard to 
keep out 
there are grounds for china to worry democracy is 
infectious said lamjar a prodemocracy activist like most 
mongolians he uses just one name 
lamjar is a leader of the social democratic movement one of 
several new opposition groups that have forced the ruling 
communists to initiate political reforms like their soviet allies 
recently the party promised free elections 
chinese leaders who used tanks and guns to put down their own 
democracy movement in june 1989 already worry about the weakening 
of the soviet party and the collapse of those in eastern europe 
mongolia has brought the trend to chinas border and the 35 
million ethnic mongols in chinese inner mongolia are a potentially 
receptive audience they already are exposed to a potent mix of 
democratic ideas and mongol pride via newspapers radio broadcasts 
and even pop music from mongolia 
one of mongolias biggest hits is a nationalist paean to the 
great emperor lord genghis our ancestor which mourns we 
have become pitiable forgive us 
what impact all this will have on mongols in china whose 
schooling stresses unity with the majority han chinese is a 
subject of great debate in ulan bator 
mongolians who travel frequently to inner mongolia said beijing 
clearly is worried they said china has severely restricted travel 
to mongolia and has increased surveillance of its mongol minority 
at stake is the stability of inner mongolia and other border 
regions populated by traditionally more restive minorities the 
tibetans and uygurs 
unrest is impossible said a man with relatives in inner 
mongolia noting that chinese now outnumber mongols there 
he and other crossborder travelers said however that chinas 
mongols are far from assimilated although many dress like chinese 
and speak chinese 
they always look to outer mongolia an intellectual said 
a mongol is always a mongol 
reuniting the two mongolias is not part of the public program of 
the new opposition groups in ulan bator despite the new 
nationalist climate 
in every mongolian exists such a dream an activist said 
but to talk about it openly is dangerous 
for centuries the only relationship between mongolians and 
chinese was that of ruler and ruled 
genghis khans successors ruled china for a century china later 
invaded mongolia but the nomadic mongols were always more 
resistant to chinas confucian influence than other east asian 
peoples 
they turned to the soviet union for help in gaining independence 
under a communist government in 1921 inner mongolia with a 
heavier chinese presence remained under beijings control 
after china became communist in 1949 the two countries briefly 
were friends but the soviet union split with china in the early 
1960s and mongolia did too 
as late as 1983 mongolia ordered 2000 ethnic chinese living in 
ulan bator to work on state farms or return to their homeland most 
left and china protested the expulsions 
in the past two years mongolia has followed the soviet example 
of improving relations with china border trade resumed in 1989 and 
chinese defense officials will visit ulan bator soon said 
buyanbadrakh head of the foreign ministrys china desk a summit 
meeting is planned in may 
every problem in relations with china is solved 
buyanbadrakh said 
if chinese leaders are concerned about mongolias turn toward 
democracy they have said nothing officially he said nor have 
they halted previously scheduled official delegations 
we have no policy to spread democracy across the border the 
official said it will be best for china if it understands the 
real situation in mongolia 
even so china might find it uncomfortable to have a 
noncommunist mongolia on its northern border if free elections 
remove the discredited ruling party 
when western governments criticized chinas crackdown on student 
prodemocracy demonstrators last june mongolias communist leaders 
said it was an internal chinese matter 
if the social democrats had been in power said ulankhu one of 
the movements leaders we would have done the same as the united 
states did

frustrated by widespread shortages and 
crippling inflation radical politicians in iran want to make 
economic crimes such as hoarding and trading on the black 
market capital offenses 
but some observers believe the real goal of the campaign is to 
scuttle the economic and political policies of president hashemi 
rafsanjani 
rafsanjani the leader of irans socalled pragmatists wants 
improved relations with the west to secure badly needed investment 
and advanced technology to revitalize irans battered economy 
mehdi karrubi irans radical parliament speaker added his 
voice to the debate with a speech in tehran on sunday 
those who are sucking the nations blood should be decisively 
dealt with karrubi told tens of thousands of iranians in the 
citys imam hussein square according to the islamic republic news 
agency 
unfortunately there has been no determined confrontation by 
the government against economic terrorists tehran radio quoted 
him as saying 
the reports monitored in nicosia said karrubis address on one 
of tehrans main squares marked the 11th anniversary of a 
referendum in which the nation voted overwhelmingly for an islamic 
government 
karrubi said the country still faces many difficulties 
following the august 1988 ceasefire that stopped irans eightyear 
war with iraq 
while the people are sacrificing for the goals and values of 
the revolution some are hoarding foodstuffs and other essential 
needs of the people he declared 
karrubi joined a growing chorus of iranian leaders and 
newspapers demanding a crackdown on hoarders black marketeers and 
corrupt officials fueling popular resentment over continued 
hardship 
despite the end of the war iran has an annual inflation rate 
officially pegged at 25 percent but unofficially believed to be 
four times that 
there are widespread shortages 
prices have far outstripped wages factories are running at 
about 40 percent of capacity although that is believed to be 
improving 
the radicals demands are widely seen as part of a campaign of 
opposition to rafsanjani the antiwestern extremists consider his 
political and economic policies a betrayal of the teachings of the 
late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini who died of cancer in june 
they has been sniping at rafsanjanis strategy for months 
adding to the pressure on the president who is seeking to revive 
the economy to ease the hardships of irans 55 million people over 
the past decade of turmoil 
former interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi who was dropped 
from the cabinet by rafsanjani in august was elected to parliament 
in december and has been organizing opposition to rafsanjani in the 
house 
karrubi declared that the economic terrorists should face 
the death penalty on conviction by islamic courts and said 
parliament is prepared for any cooperation with the judiciary in 
confronting economic terrorists 
he likened them to theomachists or those who fight 
against god 
the republics 1979 constitution says theomachists should be 
punished by hanging crucifixion exile or cutting off the right 
hand and left leg 
the leader of irans judiciary ayatollah mohammad yazdi said 
on feb 19 that it will deal with greater force against those who 
disrupt the economic affairs of the country even if theyre in 
government establishements 
he demanded capital punishment for corruption and urged the 
270seat majlis or parliament to approve legislation to that 
effect 
karrubi said the majlis had been preoccupied with debating 
rafsanjanis budget and fiveyear development plan in february 
but he said let them bring whatever article they want to the 
majlis im certain the majlis would vote with nearunaninmity 
to open the way for the judiciary to give the hoarders their 
just deserts 
hoarders should know that they will be punished for exploiting 
the people who are making great sacrifices he said

clujnapoca romania ap this transylvanian city has four 
names which trace its ethnic and political history 
to the hungarians who ruled for centuries it is kolozsvar 
germans who built neat villages all around called it klausenburg 
to the romanians who run it now it is cluj 
the fourth name clujnapoca incorporates the citys supposed 
latin name it is the only one found on signposts and on maps of 
the western region 
nicolae ceausescu the communist dictator overthrown and 
executed in december imposed the hyphenated hybrid in 1966 as part 
of his attempt to prove romania had the strongest claim to 
transylvania hardly anyone uses it in everyday speech 
ceausescus policies of destroying tradition and fanning 
romanian nationalism left a complex legacy in a region where for 
centuries three nationalities have farmed built and battled made 
peace and fought again 
after a brief period of shared elation when he was deposed the 
approximately 5 million romanians and 2 million hungarians in 
transylvania remain deeply divided 
for ethnic hungarians in transylvania which borders hungary 
the new freedom means trying to regain such fundamental rights as 
education in their own language hungarianlanguage schools existed 
for 400 years in kolozsvar ceausescu closed the last two in 1984 
in nearby tirgu mures the medical school was predominantly 
hungarian for centuries a strike last month by ethnic hungarian 
students who demanded lectures in their own language provoked a 
violent romanian reaction 
at least six people were reported killed and 300 injured in 
ethnic rioting that pitted ethnic romanians in the city against 
ethnic hungarians 
eva gimesyi is one of several intellectuals who say they are 
trying to explain their education goals to romanians who suspect 
ethnic hungarians of seeking autonomy she is a philology professor 
at cluj university 
gimesyi fellow ethnic hungarian lajos kantor and others publish 
a journal called bridge to disseminate their views 
they concede it is an uphill task memories are long in the 
balkans 
romanians have not forgotten the excesses of hungarian rule in 
the 18th and 19th centuries or the brief return to transylvania of 
hungarian fascists during world war ii 
traditions of tolerance that accompanied the ancient enmity have 
all but disappeared in an urban landscape of drab houses and dirty 
factories villages preserved for centuries as badges of national 
pride have fallen into neglect 
there is a very thin layer of romanian intellectuals with 
whom we have common aims to reenter europe gimesyi said in an 
interview 
she said most ethnic romanians are ignorant of hungarian 
language and culture discontent and lacking in political 
culture 
she and kantor believe the bulk of romanians for that reason 
could be susceptible to the nationalism of such groups as vatra 
romaneasca romanian hearth which ethnic romanians founded feb 8 
in tirgu mures 
gimesyi and kantor mindful of the old intellectual dreams of 
transylvania as a melting pot that could be a model to europe 
believe they and romanians who share their views must try by win 
converts by patient argument 
many romanians instinctively distrust the ethnic hungarians 
whose case is weakened by nationalist sentiment inside hungary 
itself 
in hungary people remember the loss of transylvania and other 
territories as punishment for being the losing side in world war i 
the emotional attachment to erdely hungarian for 
transylvania and ceausescus harassment of ethnic hungarians 
prompted hungary before the revolution to lead international 
condemnation of a warsaw pact ally 
in 1988 hungary took the unprecedented step of opening its 
borders to refugees from romania 
open nostalgia in budapest for the beautiful mountains and 
rolling meadows of transylvania feeds romanian suspicions about the 
language debate 
the claims of the magyar minority are based on their 
conception that transylvania is separate from greater romania 
said iuliu boila of the cluj branch of the national peasant party 
a preworld war ii political group revived since the revolution 
this is not true we are one nation 
long suppression of ethnic identity and ceausescus policy of 
resettling romanians from other parts of the country in 
transylvania reinforce boilas argument 
communists didnt allow diversity to exist gimesyi said 
they didnt give individuals the right to make themselves 
distinct from others 
kantor said the 45 years of communism had an irreversible 
bad influence 
gimesyis own heritage one grandmother ethnic german and the 
other ethnic romanian illustrates the delicate web of integration 
spun in old transylvania 
one major change wrought on the region was the emigration of the 
german minority that for centuries acted as a kind of buffer 
between the hungarians and romanians 
in the 1930s about 600000 germans lived in transylvania there 
were 380000 in 1966 and now the number is just over 200000 
emigration of ethnic germans averaged about 12000 a year under 
ceausescu who made west germany pay hard currency for each one 
the bright painted houses the germans leave behind either fall 
into ruin or are taken by a fastgrowing gypsy population that adds 
a new element to transylvanias ethnic mix

the world war iivintage barracks are 
hollow and silent but a 12foot fence with razorsharp wire still 
surrounds the buildings where thousands of cuban refugees began 
their stay in the united states a decade ago 
when cuban president fidel castro opened the port of mariel 
and his prisons in 1980 about 14000 of the 125000 refugees who 
came to the united states were sent to this southwestern wisconsin 
army base for processing 
one was julio gonzalez the 36yearold drifter charged last 
week with torching an illegal new york city social club and killing 
87 people 
his arrest has revived the debate over the cost to the nation of 
accepting the refugees who arrived on the shores of florida in 
boats and rafts in what was called the freedom flotilla 
duke austin an immigration and naturalization service 
spokesman said about 2600 mariel cubans are being held by the 
ins 4000 others are serving prison time for for felonies 
committed in the united states 
i would say there is probably in excess of at least 12000 
that have been involved in criminal activity he said 
but barbara biebel director of refugee migration and hispanic 
services for the catholic diocese of green bay said the criminal 
involvement of the refugees has been exaggerated 
probably for every horror story like the new york firebombing 
there are so many success stories of people starting a family or a 
business she said 
darrell neitzel a civilian fort mccoy employee who was in 
charge of plumbing for the twostory barracks where the cubans were 
herded remembered the refugees fears 
they were afraid about everything they didnt know what was 
going to happen to them next they didnt know if there was going 
to be a firing squad that was going to shoot them the next morning 
or what neitzel said 
little is known about gonzalezs activities at fort mccoy 
including how long he was there 
he never tried to become a citizen austin said we had 
never had any problems with him in the 10 years he has been here 
about 80000 of the 125000 mariel refugees have become us 
citizens austin said 
most of the cubans processed through fort mccoy and detention 
centers elsewhere in the nation eventually left for cities with 
larger hispanic communities such as miami and new york 
jesus labrador 48 stayed moving just 35 miles away from the 
army installation to la crosse 
labrador who spent two months at fort mccoy went to a trade 
school learned english and carpentry and said he did fine until he 
stumbled in 1986 when he was convicted of selling cocaine and spent 
two years in prison 
today labrador works a 4anhour job with a small company that 
makes furniture 
i have my house my woman i like it here i love this 
city he said 
other refugees have not fared as well since 1985 the united 
states has returned 375 refugees to cuba including 40 who never 
were released during their time in the united states austin said 
even a decade after the boatlift refugees involved in criminal 
cases still command sensational news media coverage 
andres p montelier 27 was arrested in january and charged 
with murder in the stabbing and beating death of an elderly 
milwaukee woman whose body was found with a large m engraved 
in the flesh montelier is awaiting trial 
lene cespedestorres was convicted of murder shortly after his 
acceptance in the united states one month after a background check 
at fort mccoy he was released into the custody of a family in 
nearby tomah a month later he was arrested for strangling the 
woman who agreed to sponsor him in the united states 
cespedestorres is serving a life term in prison 
immigration officials estimate the total cost to us taxpayers 
for ins services and justice for the mariel refugees easily exceeds 
1 billion 
i dont know how you weigh the advantages and disadvantages 
austin said certainly there were a lot of good people 
certainly there has been an overcharacterization of the boat 
people as a bunch of criminals and misfits 
but there was an element in there that was extremely expensive 
to the american public

a highly paid army of lobbyists and lawyers is 
fighting one of the last battles of the cold war an intense 
struggle to influence us policy in the obscure african country of 
angola 
it is one of the last skirmishes left for the united states and 
soviet union neither is willing to abandon its allies in angola 
but neither is either side willing to let the civil war there hold 
up overall improvements in their relationship 
while the bush administrations approach is low key 
conservatives in washington have adopted a highly visible stance 
a key test of whether the soviets have in fact changed their 
imperial ambitions is soviet behavior in angola according to a 
halfpage ad in the new york times that was paid for by the 
international security council a conservative think tank 
with the marxist sandinistas removed from power in nicaragua and 
the soviets gone from afghanistan conservatives are fast running 
out of opponents its almost their last cause said dimitri 
simes a senior associate at the carnegie endowment for 
international peace 
to counter the conservatives lobby the sovietbacked 
government of angola recently hired the legal firm of washington 
perito and dubuc for 800000 a year to lobby two other firms also 
represent its interests at an annual cost of 350000 
angola wants the united states to grant it diplomatic 
recognition to stop arming the rebels and to bring them to peace 
talks us efforts to arrange peace talks have stalled since last 
summer and fighting has intensified in recent weeks 
but while angola has made some recent advances against the 
rebels in the battlefield in washington its enemy remains 
formidable 
the union for the total independence of angola unita the 
guerrilla organization led by jonas savimbi has been fighting the 
government for almost 15 years 
according to public records the cost of maintaining unitas 
office in washington comes to 800000 a year in addition unita 
retains the services of one of the citys most powerful lobbying 
firms black manafort stone and kelley at a cost of 900000 
annually 
black manafort is closely knit to the bush administration 
through its partners political affiliation and unita hired 
another lobbyist recently robert keefe primarily for his 
contacts in the democratic party 
there is little question that unita has been far more effective 
than the angolan government at washington lobbying unita has 
maintained its influence despite losing one of its rallying cries 
the presence of cuban troops that supported the government under 
an agreement signed in 1988 with soviet and us support cuba is 
pulling its 50000 soldiers out according to schedule the pullout 
ends next year 
but the soviets are still giving angola 800 million annually in 
weapons and support for unita on capitol hill remains solid among 
conservatives and moderate democrats 
savimbi the rebel leader has made numerous trips to 
washington supporters of the charismatic leader say he favors 
democracy in angola while president jose eduardo dos santos wants 
a oneparty state 
liberals in congress led by rep howard wolpe dmich accuse 
savimbi of being an opportunist and tyrant they point to economic 
reforms adopted by dos santos to his call for elections and to his 
overwhelming acceptance by the international community the united 
states and south africa are the only countries that do not 
recognize angolas government 
but their voices frequently are drowned out 
despite us differences with the angolan government the united 
states is angolas biggest trading partner us companies pump oil 
in angolas northwestern cabinda province and new york businessman 
maurice tempelsman has a contract to export 20 million worth of 
angolan diamonds a year 
but us businesses have kept a low profile partly out of 
safety concerns in the wartorn country and partly out of 
reluctance to tangle with the powerful prounita lobby in 
washington 
when the business community clashed with unita several years 
ago congress adopted a bill banning american companies from 
writing off taxes they pay the angolan government

odessa in 1984 
ushakov is seeking not only the return of his anticommunist 
writings but monetary damages for the emotional suffering he and 
his wife irina endured 
im talking about millions he said sipping black turkish 
coffee in his suburban arlington va apartment in hard 
currency of course i dont need their rubles 
ushakov 43 now a russian language instructor recalled how he 
became the target of a twoyear kgb manhunt after he published 
underground criticism of the marxistleninist system while teaching 
at the soviet naval academy at odessa on the black sea 
tipped of his imminent arrest on charges that carry an automatic 
sentence of 12 years in the gulag ushakov said goodbye to his 
bride who gave him cash and jewelry and told him better you are 
alive in the west than dead in siberia 
at midnight on april fools day 1984 he eluded nearly a dozen 
kgb agents surrounding his apartment and began a 40day flight to 
freedom by taxi bus train and a treacherous climb over the 
snowswept caucasus mountains into turkey under the machine guns of 
circling soviet helicopters 
meanwhile he said his wife was exposed to deadly risk for 
nearly four years finally after an 11day hunger strike and an 
appeal to nancy reagan for help irina was given a passport and 
visa on christmas eve 1987 and flew to washington the next day she 
was the first wife of a border crosser to be reunited with her 
husband 
ushakov described his dramatic escape in a book titled in the 
gunsight of the kgb published last year by alfred a knopf now 
he has the kgb in his own gunsight 
according to experts in international law ushakov would be the 
first person ever to sue the kgb ushakov is confident hell win 
but the experts say the odds are overwhelmingly against him 
already ushakov is learning that it wont be easy when he 
served his legal papers at the soviet embassy last september he 
said they were shocked they didnt know what to do 
after six weeks of silence the embassy responded with a 
procedural complaint ushakov had failed to sign the 25 money 
order required for processing his civil petition 
they were stalling for time he said they were playing 
games with us 
finally the embassy responded in a feb 22 letter stating that 
the confiscated literature was being held as evidence in the 
criminal action against ushakov 
ushakov was heartened that letter was a good sign he said 
its a twoway road now its progress before gorbachev such 
letters from a lawyer simply wouldnt be answered they would have 
disappeared in a black hole 
ushakov immediately began preparing for a court battle against 
the kgb sometime next year 
he claims to have found an international arbitration panel in 
london to hear his case although legal authorities say there isnt 
a court in the world with jurisdiction over such a dispute even 
if the soviets agree to join the litigation 
hes hallucinating if he thinks he can find a tribunal to 
handle his claim said bruce fein a washington expert on 
international law this is utterly fantastical 
dr adda bozeman an expert on soviet affairs and international 
law at sarah lawrence college in new york said ushakovs lawsuit 
doesnt stand a chance in court 
no one in soviet government circles including the kgb is 
subject to the law and the soviet union does not recognize 
property rights of its citizens she said 
ushakovs lawyer myron mintz said he is reviewing all possible 
legal avenues for ushakov but added i dont think one can sue 
the kgb 
ushakov is undeterred 
nobody has dared do this because everyone was afraid of the 
vengeance of the kgb he said if such a trial is held i am 
going to win i will open the door for hundreds of writers who were 
jailed and whose rights were violated

a worldwide celebration of the environment 
will envelop this battered and polluted planet this month and by 
all accounts earth day 90 will dwarf its namesake of two decades 
ago 
even corporate america wants to get involved 
planning for the environmental extravaganza has been in the 
works for more than a year president bush has proclaimed april 22 
earth day and governors and mayors across the country are issuing 
similar proclamations 
that spring sunday comes exactly 20 year after earth day 70 
ushered in the modern environmental movement 
denis hayes a california lawyer who was instrumental in the 
first earth day activities and is chairman of earth day 1990 says 
he wants this years event to be more than a birthday party 
the goal is to galvanize a new outpouring of public support 
for environmental values and grab the attention of a new 
generation of activists in the environmental struggle of the 
coming decade and the next century he says 
earth day 1990 the corporate entity that is coordinating earth 
day activities has refused sponsorship from most corporations and 
the environmental protection agency reacting to complaints from 
environmentalists scrapped plans for an industryfinanced 1 
million earthfest on the national mall to publicize corporate 
environmental initiatives 
theres a legitimate argument going on says tina hobson 
executive director of renew america a group that has both business 
and environmental ties who has the right to participate in earth 
day only those who are clean environmentally or anyone i take 
the side that everyone is entitled to participate 
christina desser executive director of earth day 1990 
responds we made a decision early on that earth day was a day 
for people not a day for corporate publicity or corporate 
rehabilitation she says many companies may promote 
environmentally sound programs on the one hand but at the same 
time fight to defeat environmental legislation or continue to be a 
major polluter 
jeremy rifkin who for years has been among the most militant of 
environmentalists is more critical the corporations are 
attempting to steamroll and take over earth day to sell products 
and to cash in he maintains 
organizers say there will be events in 130 countries ranging 
from simple nature walks and teachins to massive outdoor rallies 
his group working with a budget of 3 million has amassed a 
130page calendar of events planned for earth day 
among them 
elementary school students in arizona will plant hundreds of 
trees 
many communities will close streets to motorized traffic and 
open them to bicyclists 
operators of chemical plants will hold open houses 
the elephants at the national zoo in washington will crush 
aluminum cans to promote recycling 
a rival group called earth day 20 has organized 
representatives of the united states soviet union and china for a 
climb up mount everest to dramatize the need for international 
cooperation in dealing with todays global environmental problems 
gaylord nelson a former senator who founded the first earth 
day said this years celebration will likely be the largest 
grassroots demonstration in history 
nelson a longtime conservationist who now is counselor to the 
wilderness society says the goal of earth day 90 should be to 
create such a stir that it shakes the political leadership of the 
world out of its lethargy and forces it to deal with the globes 
environmental problems 
ruth caplan who as a mother of two young children participated 
in the 1970 earth day celebration said the momentum created by the 
first earth day has slowed 
we must have activism in the 1990s if we are to prevent 
disaster in the next century says ms caplan now executive 
director of the environmental action foundation a washingtonbased 
environmental group 
many fortune 500 companies are planning events often in 
conjunction with their employees or local community leaders to 
mark april 22 as a day for the environment and many trade groups 
have been advising their members how to play up environmental 
issues on both the federal and local level 
the enthusiasm has not grabbed everyone 
what earth day is going to be is an antitechnology 
antibusiness antiwestern civilization orgy by people who have no 
serious concern about environmental objectives complains fred 
smith president of the competitive enterprise institute

robert alton harris waited in a special 
death row cell for word from the us supreme court today on 
whether it would let californias first execution in 23 years go 
forward on tuesday 
the court was to consider the case today after defense lawyers 
filed papers sunday asking the justices to review whether harris 
had adequate psychiatric assistance at his 1978 trial for abducting 
and murdering two teenagers 
harris 37 had been scheduled to go to the gas chamber early 
tuesday but a federal appeals judge issued a stay of execution 
friday he said the psychiatric questions raised by the defense 
were worthy of review 
prosecutors then went to the us supreme court seeking to lift 
the stay 
opponents of the death penalty continued their vigil outside san 
quentin prison sunday and a small crowd held a morning prayer 
service at the foot of the huge cross in san francisco where a 
fullsize cardboard model of the gas chamber was erected 
californias last execution was in 1967 when aaron mitchell was 
put to death for the murder of a sacramento policeman 
opponents of capital punishment say harris execution could open 
the floodgates on the death penalty 
in their attempt to save harris life lawyers argued that 
harris did not receive adequate psychiatric evaluation and that new 
evidence including exposure to alcohol before birth suggested he 
may have mental disorders 
on friday judge john noonan of the 9th us circuit court of 
appeals granted a stay saying more study of harris mental 
condition may be needed 
but prosecutors argued that noonan had misread a 1985 high court 
ruling saying defendants have the right to competent psychiatric 
counsel 
if noonans ruling is allowed to stand prosecutors fear the 
criminal appeals system would grind to a halt as defense lawyers 
go shopping for psychiatrists willing to disagree with earlier 
diagnoses

senate majority leader george mitchell has 
passed a test no other majority leader ever had to take he squared 
off against his predecessor and won 
the maine democrat in his second year as majority leader had 
proven himself a strong partisan warrior most notable last year 
was his success in defeating president bushs proposed capital 
gains tax cut which democrats said would mostly benefit the 
wealthy 
but until last week there was still a nagging doubt about 
mitchells command of the senates institutional powers that doubt 
was personified by sen robert c byrd of west virginia 
byrd preceded mitchell as democratic leader he is the only 
senator ever to relinquish the majority leaders job and stay in 
the senate hes now senate president pro tempore third in line to 
the presidency and chairman of the almighty senate appropriations 
committee 
when byrd ran for reelection in 1988 he said he was giving up 
the majority leaders job so he could concentrate on doing more for 
west virginia 
that promise eventually put him on a collision course with 
mitchell as the new leader worked to wrap up the first major 
revision of the nations air pollution laws in 15 years 
byrd for years worked against clean air legislation because it 
would cost thousands of coal miners their jobs he was convinced to 
support the newest version an intricately compromised solution 
but he still wanted an amendment to provide a 500 million package 
of special unemployment and retraining benefits for coal miners who 
would be thrown out of work 
labor groups and clean air activists endorsed the byrd 
amendment but the white house threatened a veto of the bill if 
byrd won mitchell was thrown into the position of going against 
byrd to save the bill 
for two weeks the tension in the capitol increased as the 
personal stakes mounted in a dramatic climax mitchell prevailed 
thursday on a 5049 vote 
this was his first real test to show he could knock heads 
together and make things happen said norman ornstein a 
congressional scholar at the american enterprise institute 
it was an important vote for him as majority leader to be able 
to put together a majority even though it was razor thin said 
sen john breaux dla 
mitchell can expect a far more comfortable margin this week when 
the senate plans its final vote on the clean air bill 
for byrd and the miners it was a sour defeat but while the 
vote may go far to boost mitchells power rating it probably wont 
do much to tarnish byrds image and power 
tough lastminute lobbying from president bush and help from 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan were needed for mitchell 
to defeat byrd 
more than twothirds of the senates 55 democrats sided with the 
former leader over the current one and more than that thought byrd 
was right on the merits 
if this were not a deal buster if it would not kill the bill 
i would vote with byrd said sen joseph biden ddel who was 
swayed to side with mitchell by a lastminute telephone call from 
white house chief of staff john sununu 
after the vote byrd avoided criticizing mitchell and gave 
credit to the white house for swinging votes i have no regrets 
no recriminations said byrd who can try to help the miners 
later with other legislation 
byrd said three of his colleagues said they would vote with him 
but did not when it came down to the crunch hell remember who 
they are and as chairman of the appropriations committee hell 
have plenty of chance for revenge if he so desires when those 
senators seek money for projects in their states 
as for mitchell he still can expect byrds help in the future 
byrd knows that a majority leader must sometimes take stands and 
stick by them even when many in his own party think hes wrong 
byrds not going to go away hes got his own power and you 
cant ignore it said a top senate aide after the vote mitchell 
and byrd need each other the aide said

after a twoyear delay construction is about 
to begin on an interfaith chapel at camp david the presidential 
retreat in western marylands catoctin mountains 
the privately financed wood and glass building is expected to be 
dedicated sometime around thanksgiving said kenneth plummer sr 
president of the camp david chapel fund 
i have staked it out and we are ready to go said plummer a 
semiretired chambersburg pa building contractor 
he said earth moving would start this week 
plummer immediate past president of the national lay leaders 
association of the united methodist church first announced plans 
for the chapel early in 1988 
at that time he said the board hoped to start construction in a 
few months and have the building ready before former president 
reagan left office in january 1989 
reagan and his wife nancy took part in ground breaking 
ceremonies for the chapel on july 2 1988 at that time the white 
house said it was scheduled for completion early in 1989 
plummer said the main reason for the delay was that funds have 
not come in as rapidly as he anticipated 
now however he said that between 850000 and 900000 of the 
1 million goal has been raised or pledged he said this enabled 
the board to give the navy which runs camp david the surety bond 
it required before construction could begin 
i agree with that he said we didnt want to get the 
building half up and then stop on it now there is no question we 
are going to be building it this summer 
plummer said fundraising accelerated after the original 
fivemember board dominated by protestant church officials was 
expanded the present 15member board includes leaders of jewish 
roman catholic and greek orthodox faiths 
sean walsh a staff assistant in the white house press office 
said president bush now attends religious services in an auditorium 
at hickory lodge one of the camp buildings when he is at camp 
david on sundays 
other presidents also have either joined navy personnel at 
services at the camp or visited nearby churches when they used the 
presidential retreat 
nancy reagan who gave one of the first contributions to the 
chapel fund a check for 1000 wrote in her book my turn 
that it will be nice for the men stationed there and for the 
president whoever he is 
mrs reagan said that after her husband was wounded in an 
assassination attempt in 1981 the increased security measures 
made it virtually impossible for us to go to church without causing 
an enormous disruption the reagans have resumed attendance at 
bel air presbyterian church since returning to los angeles 
plummer said he first visited the camp as a boy scout and a 
scout leader before it was taken over as a presidential retreat by 
franklin d roosevelt in 1942 he later did construction work there 
during several administrations

les aspin whose credentials as a democrat at 
times are suspect among his colleagues is keeping peace in his 
house armed services committee with a new more combative style 
politically hes keeping the administration in check the 
democrats in check and the budget committee in check observes 
republican rep john rowland of connecticut a member of the armed 
services panel 
aspin fired the first shot at the white house earlier this year 
when he rejected the bush administrations attempt to shift 
pentagon funds to military personnel accounts to avoid massive 
layoffs 
president bush had a chance to exempt the personnel accounts 
from the budgetcutting law last august but decided against it 
pentagon officials said they did not propose the exemption because 
they assumed congress would grant them the authority to transfer 
the funds 
budget brinkmanship aspin said of the administrations 
action in a letter earlier this week 
the wisconsin democrat also has been highly critical of bushs 
307 billion fiscal 1991 defense budget a military blueprint that 
cuts some conventional programs but calls for increasing funds for 
strategic weapons 
aspin believes the budget fails to reflect the rapid changes in 
the soviet union and eastern europe 
all this comes from a democrat whose hold on the chairmanship 
appeared tenuous just one year ago 
aspin angered his colleagues then by urging them to accept 
cheneys fiscal 1990 defense budget but when the house approved a 
bill that cut bushs strategic programs he referred to the 
legislation as a michael dukakis budget 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo a senior committee member 
says the chairman has got a better pulse on it this time 
aspin points to a series of events that he says made 1989 the 
transition year for defense including the increase in warning time 
for a soviet invasion of western europe and the intelligence 
communitys confirmation that the soviet union is reducing its 
troops consistent with president mikhail s gorbachevs december 
1988 announcement 
in addition there were moscows concessions in ussoviet 
talks to reduce conventional arms and the collapse of the warsaw 
pact as a military alliance 
having adopted those arguments for cutting bushs budget aspin 
then chose witnesses for his hearings who would make the same 
points 
first was cia director william webster who said the changes in 
the soviet union will be difficult to reverse a contradiction of 
statements by defense secretary dick cheney 
cheney bristled at websters comments saying the testimony 
was not helpful to bushs policies 
aspin also discussed a classified report and said the joint 
chiefs had concluded that the united states and its allies could 
fight and hold off the soviet union in europe without resorting to 
nuclear weapons 
aspin said thursday that he plans to hold hearings on the 
disintegration of the soviet army saying he was building toward 
making a case to cut the cheney budget 
issues irking members of congress include cheneys candidates 
for base closings which drew charges of partisanship the 
pentagons request for authority to shift funds deferral of funds 
for pet congressional projects and proposals for funding the aid 
package for nicaragua 
the nicaragua aid package would be partially funded by closing 
some of the military construction projects at bases on cheneys 
list of proposed base closures 
a senior member of the panel rep dave mccurdy dokla said 
aspin has a responsibility to fill the policy void this year 
if he doesnt move and we dont move were wasting a valuable 
opportunity mccurdy said

why do they want to know all that stuff 
anyway 
thats the question on millions of lips now that most americans 
have sent in their census forms but government officials say 
theres a reason for the questions theyre asking 
the census has grown from its original intention of counting the 
population so seats in the house of representatives can be 
distributed among the states 
knowing that the nation was going to be counted every 10 years 
officials couldnt resist the urge to ask some questions and once 
the questions were being asked officials started using the answers 
to design social programs and distribute money 
in many respects the census is an index to our quality of 
life said john g keane dean of the business school at notre 
dame university and former head of the census bureau the census 
shows us anew where our nation hurts and needs help recite the 
national agenda and we realize how its resolution is directly or 
indirectly rooted in census data 
nonetheless each census finds opposition to answering the 
detailed questions evidenced this year by resistance from the 
american civil liberties union and the libertarian party 
they already know too much about the citizens complained 
leslie williams of the vermont aclu who objected to questions 
about household relationships whether a home has complete plumbing 
and whether anyone in a home is disabled 
the libertarian party urges that answering the census be made 
voluntary it is encouraging people to send in cards with their 
census forms stating either that they refuse to cooperate are 
doing so under threat or law or will only answer some questions 
census officials point out that the law requires people to 
answer the census although prosecutions rarely occur 
the more detailed questions on the long form sent to one 
family in six are necessary the bureau said 
in fiscal 1988 there were 82 federal programs that allocated 
387 billion in money and other assistance based on census 
information the programs are based not just on the number of 
people but who they are their ages and incomes jobs and 
relationships to one another 
the transportation department topped the list at 166 billion 
the vast majority of it highway planning and construction money 
distributed according to census results the education department 
hands out 7 billion based on census figures 
the 55 billion from the department of health and human 
services helps illustrate changes in social trends 
the agency used census population information to distribute 26 
million to aid runaway and homeless youths 269 million for 
services for the aging 345 million for nutrition programs for the 
elderly and 239 million for child welfare programs 
census population data provides statistical proof when city 
officials apply for money to establish day care centers 
racial and ethnic information can be used to determine if 
communities comply with voting rights laws for example minority 
residents of a city could use census data in a suit seeking to 
redistrict local city council seats to provide more balanced 
representation 
during a severe summer heat wave officials in st louis mo 
used census data to locate areas with large numbers of elderly 
residents city workers then went door to door telling the elderly 
about cooling centers where they could go for relief 
outside the government big brothers of america has used census 
information on the characteristics of city populations to estimate 
where it might best find volunteers for its programs to help youths 
in newport news va a church official used age data in 
planning a new church building a high proportion of elderly in the 
area resulted in a decision to build a onestory structure instead 
of two 
many businesses have become avid users of census information 
using it to design products and services to specific audiences 
locate stores and plan for future growth

no wish list of american farmers comes even 
close to the incredible saga of how saudi arabia turned from a 
wheat importer to an exporter in a single decade 
all it took was a decision big oil revenues and some 
fantastically high farm subsidies says agriculture department 
economist john parker 
in 1980 saudi arabia decided to become selfsufficient in wheat 
by offering domestic producers 1032 per metric ton or about 28 
per bushel at that time parker said us wheat was selling on 
the world market for 175 per ton or 478 per bushel 
the result was startling he said saudi wheat production 
doubled in 1982 and nearly doubled again in 1983 by 1984 saudi 
arabia was selfsufficient in wheat 
surprised at the rapid gains saudi officials reduced the 
price by half in 1984 parker said but 530 per ton was still 
a very rewarding figure and production continued to climb 
then planners in riyadh the capital tried to encourage farmers 
to shift from wheat to lessprofitable barley those efforts 
fizzled last year when saudi farmers harvested a record wheat crop 
of 31 million tons 
exports meanwhile rose to 24 million tons in 198788 more 
than double the level of the previous year but parker said usda is 
forecasting some decline in those exports for 198990 
last year he said wheat accounted for about 310 million of 
saudi arabias 400 million in agricultural exports 
as a key member of the gulf cooperation council saudi arabia 
ships about 200000 tons of wheat to other council members kuwait 
united arab emirates bahrain qatar and oman parker said the 
saudis lose about 300 per ton on those shipments 
other mideast countries get saudi wheat including jordan and 
turkey which received 200000 tons last year previously turkey 
was the mideast wheat leader but has suffered from drought 
parker writing in the april issue of agricultural outlook 
magazine said saudi wheat also goes to indonesia china the 
soviet union portugal norway the united kingdom and colombia 
despite the governments price cuts domestic wheat prices and 
production subsidies are still high enough to allow saudi farmers 
and investors to afford the best imported us seed farm tractors 
combines and irrigation systems he said 
alarm at the depletion of underground water reserves 
especially near riyadh has not yet stopped the wheat production 
boom parker said some farms still have land area to develop 
although new licenses were prohibited 18 months ago 
the concern about water reserves helped prompt the governments 
reduced wheat price guarantees and curtailing some of the other 
subsidies 
but removing the seed subsidy and cutting the price still left 
a hefty profit margin parker said many saudi farmers earn a 
profit of 600 per acre compared with 60 to 80 earned by us 
farmers 
parker noted that despite the programs cost of more than 1 
billion annually the saudis main objective selfsufficiency 
has been achieved overall the countrys dependency on net food 
imports has been reduced to about 50 percent from 87 percent in 
1980 
during the oil embargo of 197373 when saudi arabia and other 
petroleum exporters sent prices soaring there was some talk in 
international trade policy circles of linking the price of oil to 
the price of wheat 
now this is very unlikely to happen because saudi arabia is 
no longer a wheat importer parker said

another record for exports of wood products 
was set last year with japan accounting for nearly half of the 
total 1989 value according to an annual report by the agriculture 
department

products were exported last year a 14 percent increase from 1988 
said the report by the departments foreign agricultural service 
hardwood sales rose 23 percent to more than 12 billion and 
the value of softwood products increased 9 percent to 41 billion 
other products made up the remainder 
japan the biggest customer of us solid wood products boosted 
its imports 27 percent to 28 billion other major buyers included 
canada 645 million south korea 354 million united kingdom 
233 million and mexico 224 million 
softwood logs were the largest seller at more than 21 billion 
with japan accounting for 16 billion of the total softwood

there are more than 1 billion head of cattle 
and buffalo in the major livestock countries according to 
agriculture department statisticians 
the most current estimates published by the departments foreign 
agricultural service show the us cattle herd at 993 million 
head brazils is slightly larger at 1003 million and chinas is 
1014 million the soviet union was shown at 1183 million 
all are dwarfed by indias cattle and buffalo inventory 
estimated in 1990 at 2735 million head most of the buffalo are 
the domestic buffalo used as work animals in much of the world 
particularly in asia 
but when it comes to putting beef on the table the soviet union 
is expected to slaughter 415 million head of cattle this year 
followed by the united states at 366 million 
brazils 1990 cattle slaughter was shown at 122 million and 
chinas at 10 million head indias cattle slaughter was estimated 
at 65 million head

rainer korkow leaned back on a park bench in 
a grassy square called marxengels forum and pointed to the stark 
gray apartment building across the street 
one hundred and nine marks a month it costs for my four 
rooms said the 32yearold window washer as he lounged in the 
sun with his wife and two children on a beautiful sunday in east 
berlin 
how much will it cost after reunification six hundred marks 
seven hundred and how much will i make half as much 
the 109 marks that korkow pays monthly for a threeroom 
apartment is officially about 36 west german marks 21 
the same modest apartment in west berlin one of the worlds 
most expensive cities could go for 1000 marks 600 perhaps 
1500 marks 900 
east germans who can barely follow the labyrinthine political 
wrangling that is a prelude to merging two economically disparate 
countries got a serious dose of price sticker shock during the 
weekend 
the bundesbank the government institution that controls the 
west german money supply said it was proposing east german marks 
be valued at a 21 rate against west german marks in a planned 
monetary union 
that would appear to be a good deal since east germany itself 
has only an official 31 rate in truth the currency is 
nonconvertible and virtually worthless in western markets 
but for many east germans some of whom fear a westernstyle 
cost of living as much as they hope for westernstyle wages the 
news was disturbing 
i think its terrible i work for 600 marks monthly now i 
cannot live on 300 marks said miriam jonas 20 an employee at 
the government travel bureau in east berlin all prices for rent 
and groceries will go up but our savings and salaries will go 
down 
we were very optimistic now i dont know if we can live with 
such conditions she said 
the idealism that brought down communism last year has been 
quickly replaced by shock over the cost of capitalism 
some blame west german chancellor helmut kohl for promising them 
western prosperity while campaigning for his political surrogate in 
east germany christian democrat leader lothar de maiziere 
de maizieres conservative coalition easily won east germanys 
first free elections on march 18 now he is trying to negotiate an 
even larger alliance with the leftleaning social democrats so he 
can have twothirds control of parliament and push through kohls 
plan for swift unification 
kohl said sunday that he never promised a 11 money conversion 
rate but he also did not say whether he supported the 21 formula 
proposed by bundesbank chairman karl otto poehl 
kohls sidestep triggered a deluge of criticism in east germany 
and even de maiziere responded by saying he was against a 21 
conversion 
lameduck communist premier hans modrow told the west german 
bild newspaper sunday that east germans are increasingly upset 
they will be shortchanged by the monetary merger which west 
german leaders have been seeking to realize this summer 
he said kohl would bear responisibility for any strikes or 
demonstrations 
the head of east germanys labor union federation helga mausch 
told the official news agency adn the organization was telling its 
86 million members to fight for their rights and demonstrate 
next week against the proposed exchange rate 
kohl facing his own elections in december is trying to walk a 
thin line between living up to election promises to east german 
voters without placing too great an economic burden on the west 
german electorate 
west german financial experts say it will cost of billions of 
dollars annually to improve obsolete industries and repair roads 
and communications in east germany over the next five to 10 years 
much of the burden is expected to hurt the wealthy west german 
economy in the shortterm resulting in a rise in inflation a 
decline in the value of the powerful west mark and even new taxes 
but some officials have predicted that anything less than a 11 
conversion could cause a new exodus of east germans to the west 
east germanys collapsing economy and the nearly 500000 east 
germans who emigrated west since january 1989 were main factors in 
the revolt that ousted the hardline communist regime 
many say a straight 11 conversion is necessary to allow east 
german workers and elderly people living off savings accounts to 
maintain adequate living standards in a unified germany 
east germans currently depend on heavy government subsidies for 
housing food and employment the subsidies would be phased out in 
the new freemarket economy under unification 
because of its outmoded factories unemployment would also rise 
quickly 
on sunday in downtown east berlin thousands walked through the 
historic heart of the old city 
a 55yearold man in a wheelchair said he misses the old regime 
he receives a disability allowance cheap housing and buys beer 
for the equivalent of about 16 cents 
in the first world war all was lost in the second world war 
all was lost now even without a war all is lost said the man 
who would not identify himself 
others are angry that east germans may be consigned to 
secondclass status in a unified germany 
some people think that the east germans are stupid but were 
not said sabina plesser 20 a lot of people will be 
unemployed but it will only last a little while we will learn and 
things will get better

incensed by a sniper attack that could 
cost a bus driver his arm greyhound says it wont bargain with its 
striking employees until a week has passed without violence against 
the company 
no american worth his salt negotiates with terrorists 
greyhound chairman and chief executive fred g currey said at a 
greyhound terminal sunday on a visit from dallas to see the wounded 
southeastern trailways driver 
david e bryant 58 of cincinnati was critically wounded by a 
shot fired through the front window of his bus saturday night from 
a pickup truck that pulled alongside police said none of the 46 
passengers on the louisvillebound bus was injured 
southeastern trailways is carrying passengers on some greyhound 
routes under a pooling arrangement that existed before the strike 
said a company official 
its an openandshut case of terrorism currey said at a 
news conference 
striking drivers said they dont believe any of their members 
would shoot another driver 
doctors at vanderbilt university medical center operated for six 
hours trying to save bryants left arm but wont know for several 
days whether they succeeded said wayne wood 
if everything goes perfectly his arm will not need to be 
amputated wood said 
currey was not able to visit bryant who was recovering from 
surgery when the executive arrived 
about 6300 greyhound drivers went on strike march 2 over wages 
and job security the company has reported 29 shootings of buses 
70 bomb threats and more than 100 other incidents since then 
the company had said it would meet with the union today but on 
friday canceled the session citing continued violence 
no arrests were made in the shooting 
let the facts speak for themselves whatever comes out of it 
if it ends up being strikerelated it is if it isnt it isnt 
said bill holt spokesman for the tennessee bureau of investigation 
joe semmes a local union executive blamed demented people 
they hear mr currey wont negotiate while this violence 
continues and they say heres a good chance i can stir up a lot 
of trouble he said 
i cant say with absolute certainty that it wasnt one of our 
drivers but i dont believe it was because southeastern 
trailways drivers are honoring greyhound picket lines said local 
union spokesman jr green 
by that i mean not crossing them they pull the bus over on 
the street and a supervisor has to drive it into the terminal and 
bring it out again green said 
holt called the idea of police escorting buses premature

cmdr william lewis herndon left the deck of 
his foundering ss central america and went below to don his dress 
uniform with that last act of decorum 133 years ago herndon went 
down with his ship 
on tuesday us district judge richard b kellam hears opening 
arguments in the dispute between treasure hunters and insurance 
companies over the millions in gold that sank with the sidewheel 
steamer on sept 12 1857 
on one side are more than 100 investors in the columbus america 
discovery group that used space age technology to locate and 
recover the treasure they claim the gold was abandoned and belongs 
to them by the rights of salvage 
on the other side are 45 insurance firms that have filed suit 
contending they have ties to the 19thcentury companies which paid 
more than 12 million in claims after the ship sank 
lost in the legal wranglings over the fortune is the story of 
the ss central america and the valor of its sailors and passengers 
the ship left from what is now colon panama after picking up 
passengers and mail from california among its cargo were gold bars 
and freshly minted double eagle gold coins from the san 
francisco mint 
four days later the ship ran into a hurricane and sank in 8000 
feet of water 200 miles off south carolina reports at the time put 
the number of dead at between 362 and 423 of the 578 people aboard 
and the value of the gold at 16 million 
not all the ships gold was recovered in salvage expeditions 
last year and its exact value has yet to be determined the ship 
was carrying about three tons of gold which would be worth about 
450 million at todays prices 
in addition many passengers were carrying fortunes they had 
made in california so the total treasure could be worth up to 1 
billion experts have said 
herndon had rallied his crew to keep the vessel afloat through 
the two days the ship tried to ride out the storm he kept order on 
the deck as the women and children were loaded into the four 
lifeboats 
a nearby ship took on survivors when a lifeboat returned to the 
sinking ship a witness said that herndon ordered the boat to keep 
off fearing it would be swamped by the central america it was his 
final order 
among the passengers were capt thomas badger and his bride 
jennie badger and his brother john had left virginia years earlier 
to find their fortunes in california said curtis badger a 
greatgreatgrandnephew 
apparently he was returning with about 20000 in gold the 
story goes that when the women were put in lifeboats jennie 
wrapped the gold in towels and packed it in a carpetbag she threw 
the carpetbag into the captains cabin and left the ship 
badgers descendant said 
jennie badger survived and was taken to new york city her 
husband later was pulled from the sea having clung to a piece of 
wood for many hours 
history may hold a lesson for the current gold seekers curtis 
badger said 
thomas and john badger found their fortunes in the gold fields 
and both lost them in their lifetimes curtis badger said 
after the war john returned to the family farm and lived 
out his life as a farmer and fisherman along the barrier islands 
thomas lost it all and died without much he said perhaps it 
was john who found the only true fortune

the international monetary fund says the 
united states regained its position as the worlds leading exporter 
last year three years after losing it to west germany 
us foreign sales were worth 364 billion for 1989 compared 
with 3414 billion for west germany the imf said sunday japan 
was third with 2739 billion 
west germany had toppled the united states from the no 1 trade 
spot in 1986 
both west germany and japan had trade surpluses last year while 
the united states had a deficit of 1289 billion down from 1371 
billion according to the imfs trade calculations 
the deficit is due to the fact that the united states also is 
the worlds greatest importer and its imports grew rapidly to 
4929 billion from 4595 billion 
the fund reported that the west german surplus now the worlds 
largest amounted to 714 billion japans was 639 billion 
the commerce department using different means of calculating 
the trade imbalance has put the 1989 merchandise trade deficit at 
109 billion 
of six major countries the united states had the largest 
increase in foreign sales 125 percent the imf said west german 
exports also rose by 56 percent to 341 billion since east 
germany also is an important trader a reunified germany may take 
over the worlds first place as exporter once again 
as a group the 22 countries the fund classifies as industrial 
increased their buying faster than their sales last year with many 
of the imports apparently from the third world 
led by the united states they imported 22 trillion worth of 
goods in 1989 up 87 percent their exports also rose to 21 
trillion but that was an increase of only 65 percent a 
widening of their overall trade deficit 
but the west germans imported only 270 billion dollars worth 
japan imported 210 billion worth in 1989 up from 187 billion 
the year before under heavy pressure from the united states and 
other trading partners to buy more of their industrial goods 
for the other 130 countries reported by the fund which does not 
include the soviet union figures for the year were not complete 
the funds monthly imf memorandum said their overall trade surplus 
in the first three quarters of 1989 rose to 117 billion compared 
with 88 billion in the same period of 1988 
latin american countries were an exception in the third world 
struggling to find cash to meet the interest on their debts they 
increased their surplus to 131 billion from 108 billion for the 
ninemonth period in 1988 
the fund noted that latin america was reporting record 
inflation a price increase of more than 365 percent in the 
julyseptember period over the same period in 1988 the largest 
rate was nicaraguas 4267 percent that is prices more than 42 
times the previous years rate 
nicaraguas rate affects a population of fewer than 4 million 
however brazils 144 million people suffered from 1287 percent 
annual inflation brazil accounts for a third of latin americas 
economy 
in asia many countries are under pressure to buy from the west 
as a group asian third world countries increased their excess of 
imports to 99 billion from 26 billion for the first nine months 
of 1989 
south korea still had a 1 billion surplus of exports in 1989 
down from nearly 9 billion in 1988 others including china 
contributed to the increasing deficit of the group by selling less 
than they bought 
asian countries as a whole nevertheless continued to show the 
fastest growth in both imports and exports the fund said

environmental protection agency chief william 
k reilly predicts that a threatened veto by president bush will 
stir the senate to reject a housepassed effort to establish a 
politically independent bureau for collecting and analyzing 
environmental data 
we do not want an independent agency that we have no control 
over as part of a proposed cabinetlevel department of the 
environment replacing the epa reilly said sunday we are 
confident the senate will not have a provision of that sort 
president bush in january endorsed a congressional effort to 
elevate the epa to cabinet status but the house in approving the 
bill last week said it wanted an independent bureau of 
environmental statistics in the new department headed by a civil 
servant who could be dismissed only for malfeasance 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater immediately raised the 
threat of a veto saying the house bill gives a degree of 
independence to this unit of the agency which we feel is 
unconstitutional 
reilly appearing on nbctvs meet the press program called 
the proposal for an independent data agency a slight to the epa 
rep john conyers dmich who as chairman of the house 
committee on government operations is the chief sponsor of the 
independent data agency provision said it would put a halt to 
conflicts of interest that had raised questions in the past 
about epa analyses

the united states should crack down on iraq 
for allegedly trying to dodge american restrictions on nuclear 
technology shipments and for using chemical weapons three senators

this week with david brinkley program 
i dont think weve done enough sen john mccain rariz 
said on cbstvs face the nation 
sen jeff bingaman dnm agreed saying on the abc program 
i think we need to get tough not just with those middle eastern 
countries but also with those that are supplying them 
mccain said the iraqis must be forewarned that the united states 
will exercise all options including that of military if 
necessary to prevent this enormous threat from continuing if they 
acquire the nuclear weapons we think they are maybe three to four 
years away from 
iraqs president saddam hussein must be stopped on his 
messianic mission to become a dominant force in the middle 
east mccain said 
us and british intelligence forces broke up an alleged iraqi 
smuggling ring in london last week officials claimed the iraqis 
were trying to obtain usmade nuclear triggers for atomic weapons

the us government is requiring some french 
and italian vineyards to certify that wines imported by this 
country do not contain traces of a fungicide not approved in the 
united states a spokesman says 
we have found a little bit of italian sparkling wine and some 
french wine that contains traces of a fungicide not approved in the 
united states food and drug administration spokesman bill grigg 
said sunday 
there is no ban on the wines he said but the vineyards 
involved must retain independent testing labs to certify the wines 
are fungicidefree before shipping them to the united states 
the fda will conduct spot tests on the wines to reaffirm the 
certifications said grigg 
the fungicide procymidone is made in japan and is applied to 
grapes while they are growing rather than to the wines themselves 
said grigg 
grigg said only a tiny percentage of total exports from the two 
countries to the united states was affected 
he said there is no indication the fungicide approved for use 
in europe constitutes a health risk but it has not undergone 
us clearance procedures

planners of peorias tricentennial 
celebration are going shopping across the river for a little 
history 
the group the peoria 1691 foundation has proposed buying four 
old houses in missouri and moving them to illinois to reconstruct a 
french colony of the banks of the illinois river just like the 
settlement that evolved into peoria 
the original village in what is now downtown peoria was 
destroyed by fire in 1812 so civic leaders have set their sights 
on the french colonial houses built in the late 18th and early 19th 
centuries in ste genevieve mo 
but what might play in peoria doesnt play well in ste 
genevieve 
this is just like the rape of antiquities in the colonial 
days said melburn thurman a ste genevieve anthropologist 
this is a totally unethical and reprehensible action by the city 
of peoria they are trying to steal our great prize our historic 
jewel 
but dorothy sinclair administrative director of the peoria 
historical society views the action as one of historic 
preservation 
we came along and expressed an interest in them after learning 
they were being sold and threatened with possible destruction 
mrs sinclair said 
we did not go down there in the night and carry them away we 
think its better they be saved and preserved in peoria than being 
torn down in ste genevieve 
ste genevieve a town of 5000 situated 75 miles south of st 
louis was once part of frances louisiana territory bought by the 
united states in 1803 
the historical society estimates it would cost 500000 to buy 
and relocate the houses the nonprofit group would raise the money 
through donations and doesnt need peoria officials approval 
ste genevieve city commissioners could block the plan since the 
houses are on the national registry of historic places but they 
have taken no action so far the peoria group has yet to sign an 
agreement to buy the houses 
royce and margaret wilhauk who own three of the houses said 
they contacted the state of missouri after officials in peoria made 
an offer last fall 
we have given the state an option on the houses and theyve 
asked for an extension mrs wilhauk said wed like the houses 
to stay here but if we cant work something out we will consider 
the peoria offer 
frank myers of ste genevieves foundation for preservation says 
the houses should stay wed like to share our knowledge with 
peoria but we dont necessarily want to share our buildings with 
peoria he said

jose ambrosio alvarez left for 
the united states three years ago with cooking skills learned in a 
hospital kitchen and an immigrants dream of a better life 
on sunday his body was returned in a plain wooden box along 
with the bodies of 47 other hondurans killed with him in a blaze at 
an illegal new york social club 
you leave here with such high hopes of better things said 
his 32yearold brother gerardo alvarez this has been a 
terrible blow to us 
at least 79 of the 87 people killed in the march 25 fire at the 
happy land social club in the bronx were hondurans authorities 
have said a cuban immigrant set the blaze after being spurned by 
his girlfriend a club employee the happy land club was a 
homeawayfromhome for honduran immigrants who went there to 
dance chat and drink 
the coffins on sunday arrived in the northern industrial city of 
san pedro sula aboard a dc8 transport plane chartered by the red 
cross 
the victims mostly young people in their late teens and early 
20s were largely poor immigrants from san pedro sula and towns 
dotting honduras atlantic coast such as puerto cortes tela la 
ceiba trujillo 
the story of 27yearold jose alvarez is familiar in these parts 
of high unemployment low wages and wide poverty 
clothing and furniture factories and food packing plants are san 
pedro sulas backbone but the jobs they provide are far fewer than 
the numbers of poor from outlying areas who flock to the city 
looking for work 
at the airport early sunday family members clung to each other 
for support as an orange forklift unloaded the coffins four at a 
time the coffins were laid in rows on the airport tarmac before 
the griefstricken families 
wreaths were laid atop each box and the roman catholic bishop of 
san pedro sula monsignor jaime brufeau said a brief mass 
most of them went to the united states with high hopes and 
they come back dead we are very sad said president rafael 
leonardo callejas who came to san pedro sula to be with dozens of 
mourning relatives 
army helicopters were to fly some bodies to the victims home 
towns others were simply carried away by their families 
many relatives who stood at the airport under a hot tropical 
sun for more than two hours collapsed and were carried away by 
honduran red cross volunteers 
one mans grief broke into fury toward the suspected arsonist 
damned cuban ill kill you shouted juan alberto pena 19 
clenching his fist pena of progreso was at the airport awaiting 
the body of his brother jeremias 
on friday cuban immigrant julio gonzalez 36 was indicted by a 
new york state grand jury on 178 counts of murder arson and other 
charges authorities say he set the fire at the happy land club 
with gasoline from a nearby gas station 
some relatives said they were preparing to file lawsuits 
we have made our decision a grimfaced gregorio hernandez 
said his nephew 24yearold jose manuel marquez hernandez was a 
victim 
were going to sue the city of new york the gas station and 
the owners of the building hernandez said 
wakes and funerals were scheduled for today and tuesday in 
surrounding towns

investigators worked to sort auto parts 
and lawn equipment from a pieces of a small plane that crashed and 
exploded in a neighborhood demolishing a home and garages and 
killing at least one person 
the twinengine plane flew out of control from the foothills at 
up to 150 mph sunday afternoon plowing into one of the most 
densely populated sections of this city of about 100000 situated 
30 miles from denver authorities said 
the plane hit a goodsize tree and disintegrated city 
spokesmsan david grimm 
i heard the sound of trees snapping and the most incredible 
sound i had ever heard and i realized that no one could have 
survived that crash said john mink who lives across from the 
crash site the whole center of the block was on fire 
one body burned beyond recognition was pulled from the 
wreckage and authorities were working to determine whether the 
victim was bill layne listed on the flight plan as the pilot 
grimm said the flight plan indicated there may have been a 
passenger but investigators saw no immediate signs of another body 
the crash destroyed a vacant home up for sale six parked cars 
and at least four garages authorities said 
one person on the ground was injured harold parks 54 had been 
working in his garage and was thrown some 40 feet by the explosion 
authorities said he was listed in good condition with a broken hip 
at boulder community hospital 
national transportation safety board investigator verlin b 
tranter said said it was pure luck there werent more deaths 
and injuries 
the cause of the crash was under investigation 
grimm said the plane was experiencing some sort of engine 
trouble before the crash 
tranter said it will be difficult to make sense of the wreckage 
the aircraft struck a garage and spread the equipment and junk 
from the garages around so its mixed in with the aircraft parts 
he said ive been doing these investigations for 12 years as a 
civilian and six years in the military before that and ive never 
seen such a mess weve got a real sorting job ahead of us 
tranter said the flight plan indicated the cessna 421c aircraft 
took off from the denver area to take a passenger to granby west 
of the continental divide in the colorado rockies then return to 
denver 
tranter said he didnt know whether the plane had made it to 
granby or how many people were on board the plane when it crashed 
the plane which seats six or seven was owned by skyways 
associates of raton nm he said 
mink said he watched from his balcony as the plane came in over 
a rock outcropping banked with its wings almost vertical he 
leveled out but was losing altitude rapidly mink said i saw 
him go down across the street 
witnesses aid flames climbed 20 to 30 feet high 
utility crews worked restore telephone and electricity to two 
blocks that were left without service when the plane clipped 
overhead lines

palm springs and its mayor singer sonny 
bono dont want the spring break crowd anymore but neighboring 
orange county is working hard to lure young sunseekers to shores 
freshly scrubbed after a big oil spill 
were ready for them were excited to have our beaches ready 
for easter vacation i know the merchants are gearing up for them 
and we expect a good crowd said huntington beach mayor tom mays 
the 400000gallon spill by a tanker feb 7 is now just an 
unpleasant memory the crude gone and the shoreline between 
huntington beach and newport beach cleaner than ever mays said 
come witness one of the finest surfing schools on the west 
coast you dont have to hang 10 or shoot the curl to have a good 
time reads a 73000 fullpage color ad in todays usa today 
there is no mention of the spill 
but 100 miles inland the sunbaked palm springs oasis notorious 
for spring break madness has bluntly declared it doesnt want the 
teenage exercise in excess 
libidinous high school and college students bent on celebrating 
booze sun and each other traditionally descend on the desert 
resort with one motive in mind to party down 
but now said palm springs spokesman frank cullen we dont 
see any value in having all these kids here 
this has been a growing sentiment ever since it started 
getting out of control in the 1980s and after the riot of 1986 
cullen said 
some of the estimated 15000 students in palm springs that year 
went on a rampage harassing motorists pulling clothing off women 
and hurling bottles and rocks at police since then law 
enforcement has been bolstered during spring break 
the 81member police force supplemented by highway patrol 
officers and sheriffs deputies begins a week of 12hour shifts on 
friday 
we mean business when it comes to enforcing the laws cullen 
said mayor bono feels very strongly about this 
it appears that bono himself may intervene in enforcing local 
laws just last weekend while riding his motorcycle his honor 
chased down a speeding biker 
the mayor who became famous singing i got you babe with 
exwife cher said he told the biker youd better learn to read 
real fast unless you want to spend the night in jail 
thats when the young rider noticed mayor sonny bono printed 
on the tshirt 
it costs the city about 350000 to beef up the police force to 
keep order during easter week a time when the citys population 
swells from about 40000 to more than 100000 its just a real 
drain on our resources said cullen

tiananmen square reopened today with armed police 
maintaining a conspicuous presence among sparse rainy day crowds 
the vast square was closed to the general public on sunday a 
day overseas dissidents had asked students and others to stroll 
through it in a silent protest over the military suppression last 
june of the prodemocracy movement 
on sunday the city instead brought in some 5000 schoolchildren 
who banged cymbals and beat drums as part of ceremonies to 
encourage civic enthusiasm for the asian games to be held in 
beijing in september 
chinese offices and factories told people to stay away from the 
square on sunday and warned they should not go to tiananmen on 
other anniversaries of events highlighting the apriljune democracy 
campaign 
the 100acre square chinas symbolic political center was open 
as usual today but with a heavy police presence about a dozen 
police vans and jeeps were parked on the square and at least 10 
pairs of police armed with pistols and walkietalkies were seen 
patrolling the plaza 
people were not allowed to walk around the base of the monument 
to revolutionary martyrs in the center of the square the monument 
normally open was guarded by about 15 police up from the usual 
four sentries 
fire trucks with water cannons were parked on the east side of 
the square next to the history museum and outside the great hall of 
the people to the west a dozen plainclothes police were seen 
gathered next to the great hall 
small groups of chinese and foreign tourists wandered around the 
square and long lines formed as usual to see the body of mao 
tsetung in maos mausoleum on its south end crowds were thin 
however because of the wet weather 
heavy police surveillance is likely to continue through april 5 
the annual qingming festival when chinese honor their dead 
dissidents have also called for a protest stroll through the 
square on that day to honor the hundreds of people killed june 34 
when the military stormed the city to wrest control of the square 
from prodemocracy students 
the capitals beefedup security forces will also be on alert on 
april 15 the first anniversary of the death of former communist 
party chief hu yaobang the event that touched off the biggest show 
of resistance to chinas political system in the partys 40year 
rule

forgot to set their clocks ahead

dozens of people received telephone messages sunday with a 
number and instructions to call george back upon dialing the 
number they learned the george they were looking for had left

april fools day ruse

historic site in newburgh north of new york city george and 
martha washington lived at the site for 16 months as the 
revolutionary war drew to a close

washington theyre asking for said site manager tom hughes we 
try to gently clue them in that george is george washington and 
that he hasnt been here for a long long time

day for 20 years he said some callers are slow to accept they have 
fallen victim to a practical joke 
there are many people that are convinced that there must be a 
george here and want to speak with him hughes said

voters in this college town today 
weighed a proposal by abortionrights activists to make abortion 
punishable by a 5 ticket 
advocates said the largely symbolic act could give local 
authorities an alternative to criminal prosecution should state or 
federal laws change to outlaw abortion 
what it says to police is dont go looking for abortion 
criminals go look for murderers and rapists said sabra briere 
a student services coordinator at the university of michigan who 
led the drive to put the measure on the ballot 
the president of right to life of michigan said abortion foes in 
ann arbor rather than fighting the 5 plan have been 
concentrating on a statewide petition drive to require parental 
consent for anyone under 18 to have an abortion 
were putting our energies where theyre more needed and more 
effective said barbara listing 
ann arbor is a rather unique community she added even if 
it does pass its really not going to have any effect abortion is 
still legal 
voters in this city of 108000 also were to decide today whether 
to increase the penalty from 5 to 25 for selling and possessing 
marijuana 
the 5 fine has been on the books since 1974 when the 
studentbacked human rights party petitioned to place it on a 
ballot and voters passed it 
opponents of the fine said this has created a perception of the 
city as a haven for drugs a perception reinforced with the annual 
april 1 hash bash a big marijuana party on the university 
of michigan campus 
sundays hash bash billed as a rally to retain the 5 fine 
took place only after the american civil liberties union went to 
court to force university officials to honor a permit issued 
earlier but then withdrawn more than 3000 people attended 
about 15 percent of the voters today were expected to be 
students

rival christian forces clashed with 
artillery and tanks in east beirut and mountains to the northeast 
today setting fuel tanks ablaze in an inferno that threatened a 
liquor factorys alcohol stocks 
the fighting in the citys christian sector and fogshrouded 
kesrouan highlands broke out around midnight shredding a 
ceasefire brokered by vaticanbacked mediators only a few hours 
earlier 
one person was wounded by sniper fire in the fighting between 
rebel gen michel aouns 19000 troops and the lebanese forces 
militia led by samir geagea a police report said 
at least 839 people have been killed and 2290 wounded since 
jan30 when aoun attacked the militia in a bid to crush the main 
challenge to his authority in the 310squaremile christian enclave 
police said both sides pounded each others positions with 155mm 
howitzers tanks and multibarreled rocket launchers in the latest 
flareup 
the shelling set fire to fuel tanks in the aouncontrolled area 
of jal eldib in east beirut before dawn turning the night sky red 
as flames shot up over the christian enclave 
the fire threatened to engulf a nearby factory that makes arak 
a licoriceflavored pernodlike liquor that is lebanons national 
drink 
associated press photographer eddy tamerian said firefighters 
were battling to keep the blaze from reaching the factory but 
the fire is so big it could continue to rage for days 
witnesses said a dozen other fires burned in the christian 
enclave 
the shortlived ceasefire negotiated by a threeman committee 
of neutral christians on sunday was the 15th such truce since jan 
30 
so far neither side has been able to score a decisive victory 
but geageas forces control twothirds of the christian sector 
including the ports in beirut jounieh and byblos and all airfields 
aoun must secure at least one port to open a seaborne supply 
route hostile syrian troops and their moslem militia allies ring 
the christian sector on its landward sides 
sundays truce halted two days of fighting in which aoun tried 
in vain to break through the lebanese forces defenses in kesrouan 
and geageas east beirut strongholds in the ashrafiyeh and 
karantina districts 
beiruts leftist assafir daily quoted a source close to aoun as 
saying of the ceasefire the committee has failed there will 
be no more mediations 
police estimated that up to onethird of the 1 million 
christians living in the enclave have fled to safer areas since 
jan 30 those who remain in the battle zone seek to retain some 
semblance of normality 
salim abusamra and rita zgheib took advantage of sundays lull 
to get married in the aouncontrolled zalka area but they took no 
chances both wore flak jackets over their wedding outfits 
aoun has refused to recognize hrawi who was elected in november 
to implement an arab leaguebrokered peace plan and rejects the 
plan because it does not provide castiron guarantees of a syrian 
withdrawal from lebanon 
he considers the 40000 syrian troops deployed in lebanon under 
a 1976 arab league peacekeeping mandate an army of occupation 
but there have been signs that aoun his forces isolated is 
softening his antisyrian stand he confirmed a report in kuwaits 
alqabas newspaper friday that he told arab leaders he was ready to 
accept an amended peace accord 
he did not say how he wanted the treaty changed but he has said 
before his main concern remains getting the syrians out of lebanon 
previous mediation efforts have foundered 
hrawi 64 a maronite catholic like aoun and geagea dismissed 
aoun as interim prime minister and army commander in november but 
aoun refuses to step down

american civil liberties union lawyer accused of violating the 
nations most restrictive abortion law by encouraging others to 
seek abortions

charges of solicitation to commit abortion

the united states has told afghan 
guerrillas to stay out of the drug business or risk losing support 
in the fight against their countrys government a senior american 
official said today 
what we have made very clear to the mujahedeen commanders is 
that they must stay out of drugs and that they must discourage 
production of drugs said melvyn levitsky an asssistant 
secretary of state for international narcotics matters 
we cannot accept a situation where we are giving assistance to 
the mujahedeen and they on the other hand are encouraging drug 
production and drug trafficking he said at the end of a 
threeday visit to pakistan 
the major mujahedeen groups which are based in pakistan have 
acknowledged that some of their local commanders are involved in 
poppy cultivation but the groups leaders deny they condone it 
levitsky is touring thailand india pakistan and turkey as part 
of president bushs efforts to involve more countries in the fight 
against drugs 
afghanistan produced an estimated 750 tons of opium in 1988 
making it the worlds second biggest supplier after burma 
the decadeold war between the sovietbacked government in kabul 
and the moslem guerrillas has destroyed much of afghanistans 
agrarian economy 
but the fighting has turned the small centuriesold tradition of 
poppy cultivation into a multimillion dollar industry and spawned 
what many pakistanis call the heroin and kalashnikov culture 
referring to the preferred automatic weapon of the regions drug 
lords 
the poppies yield a sticky substance that is refined into heroin 
powder in makeshift laboratories along the rugged frontier and then 
spirited through pakistan to markets in europe and the united 
states 
the united states provides an estimated 300 million in annual 
assistance to the mujahedeen or holy warriors who are fighting to 
replace the communiststyle government in kabul 
levitsky said washington would not support any government in 
afghanistan that tolerated or encouraged drug production and 
trafficking 
the point we have made to the mujahedeen is that if there is 
considerable evidence that there is support for drug production 
and drug trafficking we would not be able to assistant that 
government he said 
opium production and to some extent export have existed for 
centuries in afghanistan and pakistan 
poppy cultivation has declined steadily in pakistan but it has 
risen sharply in afghanistan where tribal areas along the 
mountainous frontier have become a haven for drug lords 
the united states has only recently started working with 
guerrilla leaders to discourage poppy cultivation and launched a 
program to promote drug awareness among the insurgents offering 
incentives to substitute poppy with other crops but most are 
unattractive to poppy growers accustomed to huge profits 
according to us officials about 80 percent of the heroin sold 
in europe and 25 percent sold in the united states comes from 
afghanistan pakistan and iran the socalled golden crescent 
the rest comes from mexico and the golden triangle of thailand 
laos and burma 
we are now beginning to look very seriously at a 
counterheroin strategy levitsky told a news conference 
many experts believe that the crackcocaine epidemic may not 
last so long based on the history of epidemics centered on 
stimulants like cocaine being rather shortlived and often being 
followed by an epidemic based on depressants like heroin he said

president robert mugabe said his partys 
sweeping victory in elections gave him a mandate to push ahead with 
oneparty rule but many said the poor voter turnout indicated 
dissatisfaction with the government 
mugabes zimbabwe african national union won all but three of 
parliaments 150 seats in three days of elections that ended friday 
it is a mandate for all our policies including a oneparty 
state mugabe said at a news conference sunday 
but the three seats lost to the opposition were two more than 
after the last elections in 1985 
mugabe had urged voters in this nation of 92 million to send no 
opposition legislators to parliament and permit his party to amend 
the constitution to institute oneparty rule that would require a 
unanimous vote 
also election officials said only about 54 percent of the 48 
million voters cast ballots in the last elections turnout was 
more than 80 percent 
most observers said this years poor turnout raised the question 
of whether mugabe 66 received the strong mandate he was seeking 
they said voter apathy was a result of feelings that none of the 
parties could bring down the nations record unemployment and 
soaring inflation and deal with transportation problems 
mugabe indicated his party would not immediately outlaw 
opposition parties or bar the three opposition legislators from 
taking their seats 
as we get to a stage when we feel the moment has come for us 
to establish a oneparty state we will do so they can continue to 
operate until that moment comes he said 
two of the opposition victories were in eastern zimbabwe the 
traditional stronghold of edgar tekeres main opposition party the 
zimbabwe unity movement tekere 52 declined to comment on the 
outcome of the elections 
the third went to a member of the ndonga party which represents 
the rev ndabaningi sithole who founded mugabes party but now 
lives in exile in the united states mugabe accuses sithole of 
plotting to overthrow him 
mugabe led the former british colony of rhodesia to independence 
a decade ago after a sevenyear guerrilla war

lithuania sent a delegation to moscow today in 
hopes of beginning talks with mikhail s gorbachev and president 
vytautas landsbergis said he hoped for a peaceful settlement 
despite a kremlin demand he back down 
about 1000 proindependence demonstrators rallied outside the 
lithuanian prosecutors office in the lithuanian capital of vilnius 
against the occupation of the building friday night by soviet 
soldiers sources said 
both a prosecutor appointed by lithuanias breakaway government 
and one sent from moscow were working in the building today and 
employees reported no direct conflicts between the two 
spokesmen for the lithuanian supreme council said legislator 
egidius bickaukas went to moscow in hopes of starting talks with 
soviet leaders and that three other people including deputy 
premier romualdas ozolas were following 
bickauskas has spent much of the past two weeks in moscow trying 
without success to begin talks with the kremlin on lithuanias 
march 11 declaration of independence 
official radio moscow quoted landsbergis as saying lithuania 
will do everything to regulate relations with the soviet 
union 
landsbergis does not view the present situation as hopeless 
it said 
the republics presidium of the supreme council legislature met 
sunday night and landsbergis was expected to address the full 
legislature during a session this afternoon to discuss a statement 
late saturday from gorbachev 
the soviet president urged lithuanians to renounce their 
declaration of independence and then enter into talks with the 
kremlin on the basis of the soviet constitution he warned that a 
refusal may result in grave consequences for all of us 
gorbachev has promised lithuania and other independenceminded 
soviet republics to establish a constitutional mechanism on 
secession but the measure presently before the soviet legislature 
gives the kremlin final authority in such issues 
landsbergis rejected gorbachevs appeal saying the soviet 
leader was demanding impossible things 
it cannot be now demanded that we annul everything that we 
bore in our hearts he said in comments carried sunday by the 
official soviet news agency tass 
at the republican prosecutors office secretary henrika pocei 
said by telephone that the chief prosecutor approved by the 
lithuanian government arturis paulauskas and a team sent from 
moscow both had appeared for work today 
soldiers occupied the building friday night after a failed 
attempt by the moscow team to make employees obey their orders but 
the workers returned monday she said 
absolutely everyone is at his workplace she said 
about 1000 proindependence demonstrators rallied outside the 
prosecutors office in support of paulauskas sources said by 
telephone from vilnius speaking on condition of anonymity 
the last western correspondents were forced to leave lithuania 
on sunday night on orders of the soviet government 
last week gorbachev said he would use force only if lives were 
threatened but soviet troops subsequently rounded up several dozen 
lithuanians who had deserted the red army and seized several 
buildings on friday taking over the lithuanian prosecutors office 
and the main newspaper printing plant 
i fear they are going to start shooting one middleaged 
lithuanian woman said sunday 
western reporters counted nearly 30 armored vehicles being 
unloaded from trains that arrived near the vilnius airport on 
sunday others drove through the city their treads slicing into 
the asphalt apparently on their way to a nearby base 
on friday neighboring estonia pledged to join lithuania in its 
drive to regain independence lost in 1940 when the soviet union 
forcibly annexed them along with the third baltic republic latvia 
latvia is expected to pursue independence next month and 
possibly move with the caution exhibited by the estonians who 
opted to defer declaring a formal break from moscow until after an 
unspecified transition period 
algimantas cekuolis a lithuanian newspaper editor who has 
become a de facto spokesman for his republics government compared 
the kremlins strongarm tactics with those of soviet leaders of 
the authoritarian past 
its the same brezhnev doctrine at work as in 
czechoslovakia only this time gorbachev is moving with a 
smile slowly and easily he said referring to the premise used 
by the late soviet leader leonid i brezhnev to justify the 1968 
sovietled invasion of czechoslovakia 
despite the pressure lithuanian officials said they are 
confident moscow will become less hostile as gorbachev presses on 
with his transformation of the soviet union into a more democratic 
state 
our tactics are to hold on a couple of months cekuolis said

the japanese make better cars the chairman of 
ford motor co says 
if you look at the japanese i think were equal to some and 
not as good as the best harold poling told the detroit news in a 
story published sunday our objective is to get there 
poling said operational costs not technology put the big three 
automakers at a disadvantage 
can we get plants in the united states to produce vehicles as 
inexpensively as the japanese do you bet he said but that 
requires shutting down your plants and starting from scratch we 
cant do that 
we have a work force we have retirees were committed to 
pensions and were committed to health care and that gives us a 
serious noncompetitive disadvantage going in we have to deal with 
that somehow 
polings comments contradict chrysler corp chairman lee 
iacocca who has appeared in television commercials and vigorously 
attacked claims that japanese cars are better than americanmade

pilots airlines and community groups have agreed 
on a drastic noise reduction plan for seattletacoma international 
airport 
irene jones a community leader participating in the talks said 
the accord could cut noise at the airport known as seatac in 
half by 2001 
this is the most comprehensive noisecontrol program of any 
major airport in the country said paul dunholter a noise 
consultant with mestre greve amp associates of newport beach calif 
the agreement was reached late saturday after 17 months of 
informationgathering and negotiation 
dunholters firm provided technical assistance to the seatac 
airport noise mediation committee a panel of representatives from 
airlines community groups the port of seattle and other 
organizations 
the plan will be submitted to port of seattle commissioners on 
thursday the port owns the airport 
it would establish a steadily shrinking noise budget for 
airlines narrow flight corridors over heavily populated areas and 
restrict noise during plane maintenance 
the agreement is unusual because it was designed by 
representatives of all groups working together instead of 
piecemeal by lawsuits said jerry cormick a mediator in the talks 
im sure that if any airport tried to to impose the various 
things these groups did theyd end up in court in a moment said 
cormick who is northwest director for the mediation institute 
cormick who helped referee the talks predicted the plan would 
serve as a model for airports around the country he said the 
plans strength lies in its direct detailed changes to reduce 
noise 
it isnt just a set of fuzzy recommendations he said 
the plan calls for an allowable noise budget for each airline 
serving seatac the budget shrinks over successive years as 
airlines would be encouraged to acquire newer quieter planes 
to reduce ground noise the agreement calls for less revving of 
plane engines at night and bans the use of engines to power a plane 
as it backs out of a gate area 
a noiseabatement committee would be established it would 
include local residents who would help monitor and enforce noise 
restrictions 
one issue the committee could not agree on was an overall flight 
plan for the airport the federal aviation administration has 
proposed a plan but cormick said the committee did not endorse it 
cormick said port commissioners were likely to approve the 
overall plan the port of seattle spent more than 800000 on 
committee activities and technical assistance

the charismatic head of east germanys social 
democratic party quit his post amid allegations he had links to the 
hated stasi secret police his party announced today 
ibrahim boehme who denies the allegations said he was 
resigning because it will take lengthy investigations to clear 
up the accusations said august kamilli a highranking social 
democrat 
east germany has been thrown into a political crisis by charges 
that many of its politicians had links to the stasi secret police 
which the former hardline communist leaders used to control east 
germany 
the accusations have seriously overshadowed efforts by the 
conservative alliance that won east germanys march 18 elections to 
put together a coalition government with the social democrats 
boehme became the second top political leader to give up his 
post because of allegations of stasi links 
just before the elections wolfgang schnur admitted former ties 
to the communists secret police and resigned as head of democratic 
awakening one of three parties in the alliance for germany which 
won the elections 
boehme announced his resignation in a letter dated sunday 
kamilli said 
he went to the former secret police headquarters in east berlin 
on friday to look at former classified documents aiming to clear 
his name 
but according to kamilli after viewing the records boehme 
decided a speedy clarification was impossible and he wanted to 
avoid burdening the young east german democracy and the work of 
the party 
boehmes attorney friedrichwilhelm von sell said his client 
found no incriminating documents the news came as a surprise 
because boehme had said after looking at the records that he would 
resume his party post today 
however von sell said more documents need to be searched for 
and examined he did not elaborate 
kamilli said a special party congress will convene to name 
boehmes successor but did not say when that would occur markus 
merkel the parts deputy chairman took over in boehmes absence 
lothar de maiziere leader of the alliance and the east german 
christian democrats has also been accused of having worked with 
the secret police which he denies 
manfred stople top administrator of east berlins lutheran 
church last week examined secret police files kept on de maiziere 
and later reported he saw nothing that incriminates the top 
christian democrat 
de maiziere has been trying to forge a coalition with the 
leftleaning social democrats to ensure a majority in the new 
parliament in order to clear the way for adopting a plan for swift 
unification with west germany 
the alliance for germany finished with the most votes in the 
march 18 elections the social democrats came in a distant second 
and the communists third

japans whaling fleet returned from the antarctic 
ocean after catching 330 small whales in the third season of a 
controversial research program aimed at counting the whale 
population officials said today 
we believe we were able to achieve good scientific results 
from the research said nobuyuki yagi a fishery agency official 
after the expedition ended saturday 
the japanese government hopes the international whaling 
commission which imposed a worldwide moratorium on commercial 
whaling in 1986 will decide there are sufficient numbers of some 
species to partially lift the ban 
japanese whaling officials say the mammals must be killed to 
accurately determine their age sex diet and health but 
antiwhaling groups call the research a veiled form of commercial 
whaling and say skin sampling and other nonlethal research methods 
are available 
good weather and frequent sightings allowed japans fourship 
whaling fleet to catch 30 more nonendangered minke whales than its 
original 300whale quota during the fourmonth expedition yagi 
said 
the research whaling plan allows a 10 percent leeway in the 
catch he said 
yagi said japan will present its findings on numbers sex and 
age to the international whaling commission which currently 
estimates there are about 730000 minkes 
the commissions moratorium on whaling was passed to allow 
scientists to study whale stocks without the disruptions caused by 
regular whaling activities 
the commissions scientific commission is to meet in june to 
recommend whether to extend the moratorium followed by a decision 
by the full commission at a meeting scheduled in july 
even if the scientific committee agrees after studying the 
scientific findings that commercial whaling should be resumed 
there is a large possibility that the full commission will reject 
it because of opposition within it to whaling yagi said 
many of the 38 nations in the commission do not conduct whaling 
and several are strong whaling opponents under the commissions 
charter members are allowed to conduct research whaling whenever 
they wish despite the commercial whaling ban 
environmental groups have charged that japans research program 
is actually commercial whaling in disguise 
the same boats and facilities are used as in commercial whaling 
and the meat obtained by the research program is sold for food as 
permitted under the commissions regulations 
japan halted commercial whaling in the antarctic at the end of 
the 198687 season when it caught 1941 whales it then began a 
program of research whaling which it says is aimed at assessing 
whale stocks 
japanese whalers killed 273 minke whales in the first year of 
the program and 241 last year 
japanese whaling officials have said at least 825 whales must be 
caught each year to make the research program scientifically 
accurate the quota for the programs first year was initially 875 
but strong opposition from environmental groups and from other 
commission members led japan to reduce the quota to 300 
in the early 1960s when japanese whaling was at its peak 
whales provided about 23 percent of all meat consumed in the 
country since then declining whale supplies have turned it into a 
delicacy

two women unearthed more than 60 sticks of 
old dynamite in their back yard and police evacuated a twoblock 
area for several hours until the bomb squad could remove the highly 
unstable explosive 
the dynamite discovered by melinda costello about 130 pm 
sunday was in a rusted metal chest and had no identifying marks 
police said it was not immediately apparent how long it had been 
buried 
costello who has lived in the house for more than five years 
said the dynamite was in a plastic bag and was wet on top she said 
she unwrapped one of the sticks and found the crystallized 
substance inside 
my friend and i were digging it up costello said she was 
smoking we were banging around i guess we were lucky 
several hundred residents in a twoblock radius around the house 
in the bernal heights neighborhood were evacuated while the bomb 
squad removed the explosive said police sgt john sterling 
the aged explosive was so unstable it could be triggered by an 
electrical charge as small as that emitted from a camera flashbulb 
he said 
while police searched the backyard with metal detectors bomb 
squad experts soaked the dynamite in diesel fuel to neutralize the 
nitroglycerine sterling said 
costellos roommate isabel saques said she discovered the box 
three or four days ago as she was turning over the soil in her yard 
for a garden and struck something hard about a foot down 
she said she found the metal box under a cement slab but left 
it because i was tired she said

the supreme court today let stand rulings that 
protect automobile manufacturers from designdefect lawsuits for 
not installing airbags 
the justices without comment refused to revive three such 
suits against general motors one against honda and one against 
nissan 
three federal appeals courts and a california state court ruled 
in favor of the car makers 
the lower courts relied on federal safety laws that until 1986 
did not require any type of passive restraints and now give 
manufacturers the option of installing airbags or automatic 
seatbelts 
the issue in each of the four appeals was whether the federal 
safety laws preempt productliability suits when the alleged 
design defect the lack of an airbag does not violate federal 
standards 
the justices in 1987 refused to order the government to adopt 
tougher standards for installing airbags or automatic seatbelts in 
new cars 
thentransportation secretary elizabeth dole adopted a socalled 
passive restraint rule in 1984 that phased in the use of airbags or 
seatbelts that automatically wrap around frontseat occupants 
car makers were required to equip 10 percent of their 1987 
models with such devices the percentage was gradually increased 
and all 1990 model cars are required to have dashboard airbags at 
least on the drivers side or automatic seatbelts 
in the cases acted on today the justices were told that 
thousands of designdefect suits are pending against car makers 
over a hundred of which involve claims concerning passive 
restraints 
the preemption issue has been raised or is lurking in every 
one of them the court was told 
massachusetts resident patricia wood sued gm after being left a 
quadraplegic from a may 19 1981 accident the 1976 gm blazer in 
which she was a passenger struck a tree she was not wearing a 
seatbelt 
the 1st us circuit court of appeals threw out her suit last 
december 
the family of willard f kitts sued gm under new mexico law 
after he was killed in a july 17 1982 crash he was wearing the 
seatbeltshoulder harness system in his 1982 pontiac 
the 10th us circuit court of appeals threw out the kitts 
familys suit last may 
florida suits were filed against gm and american honda motor 
corp respectively after charles taylor and paula evans were 
killed in separate twocar collisions taylor was driving a 1980 
chevrolet and mrs evans a 1977 honda accord legal documents 
submitted to the justices did not specify the dates of either 
accident 
combining their cases the 11th us circuit court of appeals 
threw out both suits last june 
james r meiers family sued nissan motor corp in california 
four years ago after he was killed in a crash of his 1982 nissan 
stanza 
a state appeals court dismissed the suit last may 
asked by the justices for its views in the massachusetts case 
the bush administration said ms woods appeal should be rejected 
justice department lawyers said the governments policy of 
letting car makers offer the public a choice of either automatic 
seatbelts or airbag passive protection systems is likely to be 
frustrated if manufacturers are held liable for not installing 
airbags 
the cases are wood vs gm 8946 kitts vs gm 89279 taylor 
vs gm 89852 and meier vs nissan 89940

usborn rabbi meir kahane went on trial today 
on charges of sedition for calling arabs a cancer spreading in 
our midst at a rally protesting a bloody attack on israelis last 
year 
defense lawyers called the trial a test case for free 
expression and kahane has won unexpected support from civil 
libertarians who argue the sedition law is too broad and vague 
kahane head of the antiarab kach movement and former member of 
parliament said he didnt regret his july 7 speech 
i admit to the words and i would say them again at another 
rally the 57yearold brooklynborn leader said in an interview 
outside the courtroom in israeliannexed arab east jerusalem 
only about 20 kahane followers and journalists attended the 
trial at jerusalem district court kahane wearing a black suit and 
black skull cap sat quietly during the fourhour hearing 
occasionally shaking hands with supporters and browsing through his 
appointment calendar 
defense attorney zvi hadar and prosecutor uzi hasson did not 
address the charges they instead debated a defense motion that the 
trial be dropped because the prosecution forgot to sign the 
indictment within six months of the alleged offense as required by 
law 
judge ruth or reserved her decision and did not set a date for 
the next hearing kahane is free on his own recognizance 
at issue is a kahane rally in jerusalem on july 7 a day after a 
palestinian from the occupied gaza strip grabbed the wheel of an 
israeli bus plunging it into a steep ravine on the tel 
avivjerusalem highway sixteen people were killed in the attack 
kill those who come to kill you kahane told a crowd of 
about 1000 people on july 7 his supporters chanted death to the 
arabs and waved signs demanding that all arabs be expelled from 
israel and the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
kahane is the first israeli to be prosecuted under the sedition 
law in civil court said defense attorney aharon levy in military 
court the charge was brought three times in the 1950s 
the law which stems from the time of the british mandate 
defines sedition as including speech that promotes feelings of 
illwill and enmity among different sectors of the population 
the sedition law has been criticized by civil rights advocates 
including the association for civil rights in israel 
the use of the sedition law which really has no bounds and no 
safeguards is potentially dangerous to freedom of speech the 
associations legal director joshua schoffman said today he 
declined to comment directly on the kahane case 
kahane served as a member of israels parliament for four years 
but was barred from running for reelection in 1988 after 
legislators passed a law banning parties that have a racist 
platform 
kahane founded the militant jewish defense league in the united 
states in 1968 he renounced his american citizenship to run for 
israels parliament

the supreme court today left intact a ruling 
airlines say could make it more difficult for them to merge 
the court without comment refused to shield delta air lines 
from binding arbitration that could lead to a monetarydamages 
award for a flight attendants union 
the case stems from deltas acquisition of western airlines in 
1986 
western agreed in 1984 that should it merge the association of 
flight attendants would continue to represent western employees in 
any newly formed company 
deltas flight attendants were not unionized and delta did not 
honor westerns union contract after the merger the union then 
sought arbitration to retain its status as bargaining agent or to 
win a damage award 
a federal judge threw out the unions complaint but the us 
circuit court of appeals here reinstated it last july and ordered 
the dispute submitted to arbitration 
the appeals court rejected deltas argument that arbitration is 
barred by the federal railway labor act governing labor relations 
for airlines and railroads 
the law gives the national mediation board power to certify 
unions as bargaining agents for airline and railroad workers 
delta said the boards authority over union representation 
precludes arbitration in this case 
but the appeals court said due respect for privately 
bargained outcomes cautions against freeing airlines from union 
contracts signed by the companies they acquire 
the most that can be said in support of deltas position is 
that it might prompt an airline to forego entering into an 
otherwise desirable merger the appeals court said 
the bush administration urged the justices to reject deltas 
appeal 
review is not warranted merely because the airlines fear mergers 
will be inhibited justice department lawyers said such concerns 
are speculative and in any event are not rooted in policies 
deriving from the railway labor act 
airline industry groups said the appeals court decision 
creates uncertainty and unpredictability for the future of 
mergers 
the case is delta vs association of flight attendants 89459

the supreme court today allowed maryland 
officials to revoke the license of a daycare center where young 
children allegedly were abused physically and sexually 
the court without comment rejected arguments by the centers 
operator who said her rights were violated because a psychologist 
she hired was not allowed to interview the children 
the maryland department of human resources in 1988 revoked the 
license of the bo peep day nursery in bel air state officials said 
there was extensive evidence that some of the 80 children attending 
the center had been abused 
the officials relied in part on testimony by the childrens 
parents and by experts who questioned the children and analyzed 
their behavior the children themselves did not testify at a state 
agncy hearing conducted before the centers license was revoked 
deborah cassilly the centers operator said her right to due 
process was violated because the psychologist she hired was not 
permitted to talk to the children 
she also said the center was open at all times to parents and 
that the children were supervised closely any abuse of the 
children did not occur at the nursery she testified 
the maryland court of appeals the states highest court ruled 
last year that mrs cassillys rights were not violated 
the state court noted that mrs cassillys lawyers were 
permitted to crossexamine all adults who testified about alleged 
abuse or who might have influenced any children to describe falsely 
what happened at the center 
the state court also said revoking the centers license did not 
involve criminal charges and therefore ms cassilly was not 
entitled to the same procedural protections guaranteed by a court 
of law 
hearsay evidence what the children told psychologists who 
examined them is admissible in an administrative proceeding the 
state court said 
the supreme court said last january it will decide whether 
people prosecuted for alleged child abuse have the right to at 
least one facetoface confrontation with their accusers the court 
will use cases from maryland and idaho to define the rights in 
criminal cases of those accused of child abuse 
the case acted on today is cassilly vs maryland department of 
human resources 891294

the european community today submitted a detailed 
proposal to trade negotiators for new international rules to 
protect rights to intellectual property such as patents copyright 
and trademarks 
the proposal is the most comprehensive presented to date in the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade talks and aims to combat 
increasing counterfeiting and piracy 
the ecs draft to be discussed by negotiators at gatts 
headquarters in geneva would protect patents for 20 years to 
prevent third parties from making using or selling a product 
without the patent owners consent 
copyrighting including the rights of authors performers and 
broadcast organizations is protected for 25 to 50 years and the 
initial registration of a trademark would be valid for 10 years 
under the proposal 
new accords on intellectual property rights and 14 other sectors 
of world trade are due to be signed by gatts 96 members in 
december at the end of a fouryear round of negotiations 
while the socalled uruguay round talks on areas such as 
agriculture and textiles are designed to liberalize global 
commerce any agreement on intellectual property is likely to 
increase protection 
the united states the 12nation european bloc and japan have 
pressed for more stringent gatt rules the united states is 
expected to submit a similarly detailed proposal on intellectual 
property in the next few weeks 
by contrast some developing countries led by india have argued 
that ready access to knowhow is essential to their development and 
that it should not be controlled through gatt 
peter carl mogens an ec negotiator said even though 
conventions already existed in these areas basic rights were not 
observed 
he said the plans for new rules on trademarks were meant to 
prevent the sale of counterfeit goods which not only harmed 
producers of the genuine product but but often posed a health risk 
as in the case of counterfeit medicines 
a few internationally agreed rules protect patents mogens said 
but some countries notably india refused to respect patents for 
medicines 
the ec draft also sets out protective measures for geographical 
indications or appelations of origin where the quality and 
reputation of a product is linked with a country or region 
mogens said many countries did not respect an existing 
international treaty citing the example of a third world country 
that imposed an import ban on french champagne while continuing to 
sell a homeproduced version bearing the same name he did not name 
the country 
other areas covered in the ecs proposal are the design of 
semiconductors trade secrets and industrial designs

the most popular usmade assaultstyle 
weapon the colt ar15 rifle may soon be back on the civilian 
market and some gun control advocates are dismayed at the prospect 
theyre putting profits over public safety said susan 
whitmore of handgun control inc we dont want to see one more 
assault weapon on the streets and this is just going to add to 
it 
the colt ar15 was the most popular usmade semiautomatic 
assaultstyle weapon rifle or pistol when colt industries inc 
voluntarily shut down production for the civilian market in march 
1989 
the company took that action a day after the government 
temporarily suspended imports of similar foreignmade rifles and 
it never resumed them according to mike dunn spokesman for colt 
industries 
but colt firearms division of the company was sold march 22 to a 
group of investors cf holding leading to the possible change in 
policy 
ron stilwell executive vice president and chief operating 
officer of what is now called colts manufacturing company inc 
said the company is evaluating whether to start producing ar15s for 
the civilian market again 
we are evaluating that stilwell said in an interview we 
will have some formal statements on it in the future 
we firmly believe it is a legitimate sporting system and in 
fact the only system that can be used for certain national target 
matches he said 
national rifle association lobbyist david conover said good 
for them when told today about the possible resumption of ar15 
production 
i think that there are a lot of lawabiding gun owners out 
there who enjoy owning ar15s and certainly use them in competitive 
target shooting and recreational target shooting conover said 
in 1988 the last full year of production of ar15s for civilian 
sale colt made 17368 of the rifles according to a bureau of 
alcohol tobacco and firearms list 
other us manufacturers made 9411 copies of the colt ar15 that 
year according to the list atf spokesman jack killorin said he 
did not know if those manufacturers boosted production last year to 
fill the market for ar15s 
in all the list showed that domestic manufacturers produced 
about 80000 assaultstyle weapons in 1988 about half of which 
were rifles with the same characteristics as foreign weapons banned 
from import last year 
why on earth would any civilized society allow the manufacture 
and overthecounter sales of any rifle or pistol designed to 
accept silencers or bayonets asked rep pete stark dcalif a 
gun control advocate who sought the information from atf he 
released the list on sunday 
whats a bayonet for charging deer asked stark 
the list included 38108 rifles and an unknown number of quality 
parts bushmaster rifles and ruger mini 14s it also lists 40093 
pistols although the ban on imports did not include pistols 
first on the list in total production was the colt ar15 
followed by intratec tec 9 pistol at 13770 and the swd mac11 
pistol at 12273 
the 26 types of weapons had at least one of the following 
assaulttype characteristics threaded barrels to accommodate a 
silencer flash suppressors that could hide the shooters position 
at night and prevent a loss of night vision provisions for 
mounting a bayonet or folding or collapsible stocks 
the atf listed such characteristics when it defined 43 types of 
foreignmade guns as semiautomatic assault rifles that it 
banned from import last july 
atf director stephen e higgins in announcing the ban said a 
study had found that the models were not being used for sporting 
uses a requirement for imports 
two weeks ago the house judiciary subcommittee on crime 
approved a bill that would outlaw domestic assaultstyle weapons 
the bill introduced by rep william hughes dnj outlaws 
domestic and foreignmade assaultstyle rifles as well as domestic 
and imported assaultstyle pistols which can accept a silencer or a 
bayonet the measure passed 53 awaits action in the house 
judiciary committee 
national rifle association lobbyist dave conover said the 80000 
figure from the atf would tell me theyre being fairly narrow in 
their interpretation of what would be a prohibited firearm 
the nra estimates there are a total of 35 million to 4 million 
militarystyle semiautomatic firearms in us circulation 
to whitmore of handgun control however the total points up 
so clearly that congress has to act quickly these things are 
flooding the market

a 30mile fuel slick drifting down the 
allegheny river today threatened the drinking water supply for 
about 1 million people and some schools were closed to conserve 
water 
one town of 15000 people already had to have water trucked in 
other communities drew water from tributaries to the allegheny 
rather than the river itself to build up reserves 
the slick resulted from a landslide that broke a pipeline friday 
and released 85000 to 98000 gallons of gasoline kerosene and 
other fuels near freeport 
pittsburgh joined with other communities in calling for 
voluntary conservation of water as it prepared to close its 
treatment plant other treatment centers upstream were already 
closed 
we know were next and were just waiting for it to get to 
us said pittsburgh water department spokeswoman donna 
sagmeister the citys system serves 500000 people 
classes for about 18600 students in six pittsburgh area school 
districts were cancelled today to conserve water 
gov robert p casey declared a state of emergency sunday in the 
area of the spill 
we believe we have in place a process and procedure to assure 
a continued water supply to all affected areas casey said 
officials flew over the area to search for the leading edge of 
the slick today but could not immediately determine how far it was 
from the city said pittsburgh public safety spokeswoman margaret 
philbin 
theres a definite sheen farther up the allegheny river and a 
slight sheen was spotted closer to us this morning but were not 
sure if its from the spill or from another source she said 
pittsburgh mayor sophie masloff said her city had more than 
three days worth of pure water in its reservoir conservation could 
stretch that by two days she said 
the spill threatened the water supply for about 1 million 
residents of communities along the allegheny and ohio rivers the 
allegheny and the monongahela join at pittsburgh to form the ohio 
river 
normal water service was shut off to the 15000 residents of 
harrison township and water was sent in sunday by truck said nat 
mastro deputy county fire marshal 
preparations were also made in beaver county which is on the 
ohio river northwest of pittsburgh 
beaver county emergency services director russell chiodo said he 
was advising eight water authorities serving about 40000 people to 
begin saving water 
we want them to be conservative as all heck right now he 
said we dont know whats going to happen 
buckeye pipeline co estimated it lost up to 98000 gallons of 
fuel from its 10inch pipeline which extends from linden nj to 
the pittsburgh suburb of coraopolis the company said cleanup 
workers using floating booms and absorbent pads recovered about 20 
percent of the fuel 
dennis vrotny emergency management director for brackenridge 
upstream said his community and others were drawing water from 
tributaries to the allegheny to add to their reservoirs fire 
departments were pumping as much water out of creeks as possible 
he said but cooperation from residents was essential 
vrotny said the water system in brackenridge a community of 
about 4000 serves 30000 people i dont think its going to 
hold if people dont conserve now vrotny said as it is were 
losing ground fast

donald trump today opened the 
boardwalks newest casino and several hundred wouldbe high 
rollers flocked inside to slap down play money on the gaming tables 
and feed real coins to the slot machines 
the taj mahal casino hotel resort named for indias sacred 16th 
century mausoleum opened in a steady drizzle and a deluge of 
publicity 
turnout is great considering the weather trump said 
flanked by three bodyguards as he walked the 120000square foot 
casino floor and greeted employees 
about 50 state gaming investigators would be checking that 
dealers know their games and that proper internal controls 
surveillance and accounting procedures are in place said anthony 
parrillo director of the state division of gaming enforcement 
the slot machines accepted real coins but gamblers at the tables 
craps roulette baccarat had to forego gambling with real 
money until the state inspectors determine that casino workers are 
following proper procedures 
two state casino control commissioners assigned to supervise the 
opening will evaluate each departments performance today and 
decide whether the casino needs another play day 
parrillo said the average for the 12 casinos that have opened in 
the city has been two days of play money followed by two days 
of permitting small wagers 
the state already has tested the casino in items ranging from 
the arcane securitys response to a hostage situation to the 
mundane whether the fire alarms work employees used friday and 
saturday nights to test their fellow workers at the tables 
parrillo said the trump organization has experience in opening 
atlantic city casinos but the sheer size of the taj mahal a 
third larger than its biggest competitor here leaves room for 
more mistakes 
the trump castle casino by the bay opened june 17 1985 and 
accepted limited cash bets the next day but the trump plaza hotel 
and casino had a rockier road when it opened may 14 1984 
trump plaza also went to limited cash betting the next day but 
went nearly two weeks at 50 percent capacity before the gambling 
hall voluntarily shut to retrain gaming table employees

a massachusetts church lost a supreme court 
appeal today over its claim that religious freedom will be violated 
if state approval is required for its schools curriculum 
the justices without comment let stand a ruling that the new 
life baptist church academy in east longmeadow mass must submit 
for approval the nonreligious education its students receive 
new life baptist a fundamentalist church founded in 1977 began 
operating a school in 1981 to provide a religiously based education 
for the children of its members 
state law requires all private schools to offer in addition to 
any religious training a secular or nonreligious education 
comparable to that provided in public schools 
under state law the church was required to seek the approval of 
a local school committee for the schools academic program 
new life baptists leaders believe it is a sin to seek such 
state approval for the school 
the church does not object to all state regulation such as 
assuring that the school meets health and safety requirements but 
lawyers for the church argued that subjecting the schools 
educational mission to state regulation was too intrusive on 
religious principles said state officials should devise some less intrusive 
way 
such as standardized testing to assure that new life baptist 
academy students are receiving a proper education in nonreligious 
subjects 
but the 1st us circuit court of appeals reversed wolfs ruling 
last september 
the appeals court said wolfs suggested alternatives would not 
be any less intrusive and that the local school committees 
proposed method of gathering information for its approval decision 
does not threaten religious freedom 
in the appeal acted on today new life baptist lawyers urged the 
justices to strike a balanced protection for the church as well 
as the state 
the appeal argued that in this case the government has 
leaped the wall of separation and it is the church crying out for 
protection 
the case is new life baptist church academy vs east longmeadow

republican party chief lee atwater was 
admitted to a new york hospital today for additional treatment 
designed to minimize the potential aggressiveness of a 
nonmalignant tumor on the right side of his brain 
atwaters top deputy at the republican national committee mary 
matalin said in a statement that atwater entered new yorks 
montefiore medical center for a procedure know as a interstitial 
radiation implantation 
the procedure involves inserting a radioactive isotope into the 
tumor for which atwater twice has been hospitalized for treatment 
in the past month the statement said the procedure involves local 
anesthesia and that the isotope would be implanted for five days 
consultations with the top brain tumor specialists in the 
country resulted in a consensus diagnosis that lee has a small 
treatable tumor located in the right frontal lobe ms matalin 
said in the statement after indepth examination and evaluation 
doctors determined that the tumor has the potential to behave 
aggressively 
the statement said atwater after hearing the diagnosis opted 
to have the treatment described in the statement as the stateof 
the art method of radiation treatment 
it said results of the procedure would not be known for eight to 
12 weeks 
but one of the doctors involved in the treatment was optimistic 
mr atwaters age and excellent physical condition together 
with the early diagnosis of the tumor its size and location offer 
favorable circumstances for successful results said dr paul l 
kornblith a neurosurgeon 
atwater 39 has been receiving radiation treatments virtually 
daily since the tumor was diagnosed march 6 after he collapsed 
while giving a speech at a political event 
he returned to work just days after the first episode but was 
hospitalized again 10 days ago for two days after complaining of 
queasiness a republican national committee statement said doctors 
attributed atwaters queasiness to a medication imbalance 
after the first episode atwater said he was told he would have 
to undergo daily radiation treatments his doctors had ruled out 
surgery for the tumor 
atwaters doctors have not explained that decision but other 
physicians have said surgery often is ruled out because of the 
location of tumors 
the source said atwater was very upbeat sunday in talking 
about plans to undergo the treatment 
atwater was named rnc chairman after managing the successful 
bush presidential campaign he also had worked on both reaganbush 
campaigns 
in an interview after being released from the hospital the first 
time atwater said i fooled myself into thinking i was 
indestructible i realize now im down here on someone elses

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether huge punitive damage awards in lawsuits may violate 
constitutional guarantees of fundamental fairness 
the court said it will consider overturning a 1 million award 
and three smaller awards to alabama residents who successfully sued 
an insurance company for fraud 
the case of enormous importance to american business is likely 
to be decided in 1991 
in other action the court 
let stand rulings that protect automobile manufacturers from 
designdefect lawsuits for not installing airbags 
the justices without comment refused to revive three such 
suits against general motors one against honda and one against 
nissan three federal appeals courts and a california state court 
ruled in favor of the car makers 
left intact a ruling airlines say could make it more difficult 
for them to merge 
the court without comment refused to shield delta air lines 
from binding arbitration that could lead to a monetarydamages 
award for a flight attendants union 
turned away an appeal by a massachusetts church that says its 
religious freedom will be violated if state approval is required 
for its schools curriculum 
the justices without commewnt let stand a ruling that the new 
life baptist church academy in east longmeadow mass must submit 
for approval the nonreligious education its students receive 
allowed maryland officials to revoke the license of a daycare 
center where young children allegedly were abused physically and 
sexually 
the court without comment rejected arguments by the centers 
operator who said her rights were violated because a psychologist 
she hired was not allowed to interview the children 
the justices ruled last year that huge awards in civil suits 
often millions of dollars do not violate the constitutions ban on 
excessive fines but the court left open the possibility that such 
awards intended to punish wrongdoers may be so disproportionate 
to the actual harm that they violate dueprocess rights 
the constitution says states may not deprive anyone of property 
without due process of law those wishing to limit damage awards 
say due process prohibits unlimited discretion by judges and juries 
in the case acted on today pacific mutual life insurance co 
was found by a jury to have participated in fraud by one of its 
agents lemmie ruffin 
employees of roosevelt city ala paid health insurance 
premiums to ruffin which he pocketed according to court records 
cleopatra haslip a city worker who had been paying premiums 
incurred 2500 in hospital and medical bills in 1982 and then 
learned her insurance had been cancelled by pacific mutual 
the hospital demanded 600 before agreeing to discharge her and 
her doctor eventually turned her case over to a collection agency 
her credit also suffered from her inability to pay the bills 
mrs haslip and other members of the insurance plan sued pacific 
mutual and ruffin and a jury in 1987 awarded her 1040000 three 
others were awarded 10288 12400 and 15290 
it is not clear from records filed with the supreme court how 
much of the money was intended to compensate the workers for actual 
losses and how much was designed to punish the insurance company 
the alabama supreme court upheld the awards last year the state 
court said jury verdicts are presumed correct and that 
presumption is strengthened when the presiding judge refuses to 
grant a new trial 
pacific mutual said its constitutional rights were violated 
because the jury was allowed to award damages as a matter of 
moral discretion without adequate standards as to the amount 
necessary to punish and deter 
the company also said it is the victim of unfair discrimination 
because alabama law limits punitive damages in some cases 
including usury and some areas of consumer fraud 
the case is pacific mutual vs haslip 891279

president saddam hussein today admitted 
that iraq has sophisticated binary chemical weapons and warned that 
if israel attacked it iraq will retaliate and destroy half of the 
jewish state 
in a speech broadcast by the staterun radio saddam denied iraq 
had nuclear weapons and that sophisticated devices bought from the 
united states were meant for nuclear weapons development 
in a statement issued after saddams speech the iraqi foreign 
ministry denied that iraq was trying to develop nuclear weapons and 
said such charges were intended to prevent it from obtaining 
scientific and technical knowhow 
saddam lashed out at western criticism of what us and british 
authorities said were clandestine efforts by baghdad to smuggle 
parts for nuclear weapons and over the march 15 execution of 
britishbased reporter farzad bazoft on spying charges 
saddam said bazoft a reporter for the london observer weekly 
was a spy and that iraq will chop the heads off spies 
israel condemned saddams comments on chemical weapons 
it is high time for the civilized world to act in unity and 
see to it that mr saddam hussein will not have the possibility to 
pursue his irresponsible and criminal designs said foreign 
ministry spokesman yossi amihud in jerusalem 
avi pazner a spokesman for prime minister yitzhak shamir said 
israel had no aggressive intention against anyone including 
iraq 
asked about the possibility of a preemptive strike against iraq 
to neutralize the chemical threat he said we dont even want to 
talk about that kind of thing 
israeli aircraft attacked and damaged a frenchbuilt iraqi 
nuclear reactor near baghdad in june 1981 israel claimed iraq was 
using it to develop nuclear weapons baghdad denied the charge 
british authorities arrested several iraqis in london last week 
as they allegedly tried to smuggle krytrons or electronic devices 
used to trigger nuclear weapons from the united states 
in his first public comment on the arrests saddam denied claims 
that iraq intended to use the devices for atomic weapons 
he said the devices were only condensors which we bought for 
10500 and its not logical that these could be used in atomic 
bombs 
but he defended iraqs right to build unconventional weapons 
i categorically deny that we have any atomic bombs but let 
them iraqs critics hear here and now that we do possess binary 
chemical weapons which only the united states and the soviet union 
also have he declared 
these weapons contain two relatively safe compounds which are 
mixed shortly before release to create lethal toxic gases 
it was believed to be the first time the iraqi leader has 
admitted that his country possesses binary weapons although 
western intelligence agencies have long said the iraqis were 
developing such weapons at topsecret installations 
in a clear reference to israel believed to be the middle easts 
only nuclear power saddam said those who are threatening us 
with nuclear bombs we warn them that we will hit them with these 
binary chemical weapons 
i also say that if israel dares to hit even one piece of steel 
on any industrial site we will make the fire eat half of israel 
he said 
saddam claimed that criticism of his country was intended to 
intimidate iraq and to pave the way for israel to attack us 
iraqi officials admitted they used some types of chemical 
weapons during the 198088 war with iran but claimed they used 
them in selfdefense 
they deny widespread allegations by governments and human rights 
groups that they used chemical weapons outlawed under a 1925 
geneva protocol against their kurdish minoity in areas held by 
kurdish separatist guerrillas 
almost 100000 iraqi kurds fled to turkey in august 1988 
claiming that iraqi warplanes were dropping chemical weapons on 
their villages 
iraq has warned israel several times in the past two years 
against launching preemptive strikes against its burgeoning arms 
industry that baghdad now says is capable of producing longrange 
missiles and rockets capable of putting satellites into orbit 
in december iraq announced it had tested two longrange 
missiles with ranges of up to 1200 miles enough to reach either 
tehran or tel aviv 
israeli officials said a preemptive strike is unlikely despite 
iraqs development of missile technology 
saddams fierce rhetoric comes amid growing arab frustrations 
with israels refusal to enter peace talks with the palestinians 
and an expected flood of tens of thousands of soviet jewish 
emigrants to israel following moscows easing of travel 
restrictions 
saddam claimed that during the war iraq was offered enriched 
uranium and even a complete atomic bomb by people who were either 
american british or zionist agents but iraq turned down these 
offers 
he gave no details

manuel noriegas defense attorneys showed 
television footage of the us invasion of panama today and called 
a former us attorney general to the stand as they argued that his 
drug case should be dropped 
the video footage showed scenes of buildings in flames 
shootouts and wounded and dead bodies defense attorney frank 
rubino said the scenes depicted outrageous conduct on the part of 
the us government 
rubino said the video was put together by his staff from reports 
on the invasion by the us television networks and a panama city 
station 
government attorneys objected to much of rubinos presentation 
calling it out of place but rubino said it shows noriega was 
brought to this country in a shocking way a legal standard he 
says mandates that the 1988 drug case against noriega be dismissed 
by us district judge william hoeveler 
earlier when both sides were complaining about delays in 
exchanging discovery information hoeveler told the attorneys he 
wouldnt allow such issues to postpone noriegas trial it is set 
to begin jan 28 1991 
ramsey clark former us attorney general testified about 
reports of mass graves and seeing body bags some with more than 
one body in them during an independent inquiry he made in panama 
in prehearing papers filed with the court the defense cites 
conduct by the united states government shocking to the 
conscience and in violation of the laws and norms of humanity 
clark claims civilian deaths following the dec 20 military 
action numbered in the thousands rather than in the hundreds as 
the defense department has stated it also includes reports that 
civilians and in some cases the press were deliberately targeted 
by us soldiers 
key to the defense arguments is a 1974 case called united states 
vs toscanino in which a federal appeals court ruled that shocking 
behavior in the arrest of a defendant even outside the united 
states could be grounds for freeing him 
noriega attorney john may said that us abuses during the 
invasion were sufficiently shocking to require a dismissal 
nothing general noriega is accused of could ever justify such 
a deliberate taking of human life the dismissal motion said 
if ever there were a case where our courts must act to deter such 
conduct from occurring again such a case is this 
the us attorneys office here defends the invasion 
it calls the civilian deaths an unfortunate unavoidable 
byproduct of any military action in an urban area the 
prosecutors also question the findings and integrity of the 
investigatory commission 
we believe that the report of that organization is 
extraordinarily biased and inaccurate in many respects says the 
response filed by prosecutors michael sullivan and myles malman 
but there is no need to debate the invasion the prosecutors 
say because the us supreme court has never accepted the 
toscanino rule 
in fact they say the high court recently ruled in united 
states vs verdugourquidez that the fourth amendment protection 
against illegal search and seizure does not apply to noncitizens 
outside the country the prosecutors say 
the defense had subpoenaed gen colin powell chairman of the 
joint chiefs of staff to testify today but us district judge 
william hoeveler quashed the subpoena 
the subpoena had asked powell to produce civilian and military 
casualty predictions made prior to the invasion reports on 
civilian deaths lists of weapons used and any information on 
management of the press 
noriega faces 145 years in prison if convicted of a variety of 
drug counts in a 1988 indictment that accused him of accepting 
bribes from colombias medellin drug cartel to turn panama into a 
way station for usbound cocaine

turned into a day of horror at the familys 18room mansion in 
westfield said brian gillet an assistant union county prosecutor 
this defendant systematically executed his wife helen his 
wife of almost 20 years his 84yearold mother alma his daughter 
patricia his son frederick his son john all his own flesh and 
blood gillet said 
in reviewing evidence the jury would hear gillet said list left 
notes at the childrens school and employer saying the family had 
to go to north carolina he also stopped mail delivery and canceled 
newspaper subscriptions 
like the accountant he was list closed the books balanced 
out the accounts before he fled and took on a new life assuming 
another identity almost immediately gillet said 
john e list was buried long before alma helen patricia 
frederick and john were laid to rest the prosecutor said 
until today defense attorney elijah l miller jr said little 
publicly about how he plans defend list on five counts of first 
degree murder 
his opening statements said the killings had to be viewed as the 
product of a fragmented man unable to deal with changing times 
list a war veteran began to see failure at every turn in 
an age of rebellion and changing morals 
he saw his family disintegrating and falling from their 
religion but he had to do something under church teachings that he 
was charged with their salvation miller said 
he committed these acts with love in his heart said miller 
for the salvation of his family he had to act as he did 
miller said that he would trace lists past to show these 
killings are something other than murders 
miller said list still suffers from a mental disease he argued 
that lists diminished capacity could let the jury return a 
conviction on a lesser charge 
on dec 7 1971 police found the bodies of lists 45yearold 
wife his mother and the children patricia 16 john jr 15 and 
frederick 13 police said the family was killed nov 9 1971

the identity of robert p clark and lived in the denver area

the federal government has paid about 23 million 
since 1979 for legal fees of rocky flats nuclear weapons plant 
operators who were sued on behalf of workers allegedly killed or 
injured by radiation a newspaper reported today 
yet total damages sought by seven widows and one living worker 
whose cases have come to trial is only about 1 million the denver 
post said 
the post quoted federal records which show the governments 
share of that potential liability is less than 400000 the rest 
of the claims would have been paid out of a state fund created by 
colorado employers 
to date two widows have won workers compensation lawsuits 
collecting a total of about 60000 a third case has been settled 
out of court for an estimated 10000 
in each case the government has argued that the workers deaths 
and cancers were caused by something other than exposure to 
onthejob radiation 
the inspector general of the department of energy which owns 
the rocky flats plant outside denver will conduct an informal 
review to determine if the legal fees are justified said rob 
jacques an assistant to the inspector general 
the legal fee records obtained by the denver post through the 
freedom of information act show that the money was paid by the 
plants two previous operators dow chemical and rockwell 
international corp to the denver law firm of martinez amp allman 
the department of energy then reimbursed the plant operators 
attorneys robert allman and larry martinez said the key legal 
decisions in each case were made by their clients the plant 
operators and the energy department 
federal records show the two lawyers billed an average of nearly 
30000 a month from june 1984 through january 1990 even though 
most of the official legal appearances hearings and appeals were 
concluded before june 1984 
during 1986 and 1987 state records show almost no formal legal 
proceedings took place on any of the cases yet the lawyers charged 
the government 341000 and 273000 for each year respectively 
between 1979 and june 1984 the government spent roughly 
425000 defending its operators the records show since then the 
government has paid almost 19 million on legal fees 
according to bruce deboskey the denver lawyer who has 
represented each of the widows and workers filing cases against 
rocky flats martinez and allman routinely turned down offers to 
settle cases for less than what was being claimed and only settled 
one case in which a living rocky flats worker was the claimant 
this appears to be the last vestige of an official government 
policy to defeat the claims of the widows of rocky flats workers 
regardless of the cost or the consequences to the taxpayers or to 
the workers compensation system deboskey said 
deboskey was the first lawyer in the nation to successfully 
prove in court that exposure to permissible levels of radiation at 
a nuclear weapons plant contributed to the cancer death of an 
employee

county legislators slapped together a 
financial package to rescue buffalos transit system early today 
but the transit authority did not approve the plan about 120000 
bus and subway riders were forced to find other means of 
transportation 
the citys 6yearold 6mile subway and its 1115mile bus 
network serving buffalo and niagara falls made their last runs 
early sunday hours after the transit agency ran out of money and 
became the first federally subsidized mass transit system in the 
united states to fail 
an agreement to finance the agency was announced around dawn by 
erie county executive dennis gorski 
but the niagara frontier transportation authority commissioners 
failed to vote on the package after meeting for more than an hour 
this morning five of the seven commissioners present spoke out 
against the plan which called for a 10cent fare increase to 
110 suspension of weekend service and the layoffs of 125 of 600 
bus drivers 
the commissioners recessed their meeting indefinitely after 
gorski announced that an aide to gov mario cuomo indicated some 
state aid might be available to get the transit system running 
commissioners said they wanted to know more about that possibility 
in albany cuomo spokeswoman anne crowley said she knew nothing 
about the possibility of the state stepping in 
teachers threatened a court fight on behalf of high school 
students who use the mass transit system 
the shutdown of the system deprives 11000 buffalo high school 
students of transportation said philip rumore president of the 
buffalo teachers federation 
the union said sunday it would try to force the transit 
authority back into business by going to federal court and claiming 
the shutdown cripples a courtordered school desegregation program 
begun in 1976 
public and private schools in new yorks secondlargest city 
were open today and buffalos 25000 elementary students rode 
privately contracted buses as usual 
rumore said attendance in buffalo high schools was 50 percent of 
normal 
motorists didnt face bigcity style gridlock buffalo with a 
population of about 324000 doesnt have that type of traffic 
but people can expect at least a halfhour delay coming into the 
city parking board director thomas gallagher said 
the evening commute could be worse with road work closing or 
restricting lanes on three major roads out of downtown 
gallagher said about 65 percent of the 55000 to 58000 people 
who work downtown commute by car and there are about 24000 parking 
spaces downtown 
if most of the people who use public transportation dont stay 
home we couldnt handle everybody coming in gallagher said 
one woman tennizee high said she walked an hour and a half to 
get to her downtown job everybody was walking together with 
sneakers on she said can you believe it 
cathy wlodarczyk manager of a burger king said all her 
employees got to work this morning we had it planned ahead of 
time who was supposed to pick up whom most of them walked she 
said 
gorski offered on saturday night to release 2 million in 
emergency funds but the transit authority refused to consider the 
offer because it didnt address longrange funding for the system 
the county legislature last week voted against a utility tax 
that would have provided 9 million annually toward operating the 
system 
the system cost 55 million a year to run and the costs werent 
covered by a combination of farebox revenues and grants from the 
county state and federal governments 
cuomo said sunday that until a longterm source is found there 
is nothing the state can do to help the governor said the erie 
county legislature had reneged on its pledge to find the longterm 
funds 
a promise to obtain such a source was one reason the federal 
government agreed to pay about 500 million to build the subway 
theyve had over two years and they havent acted on it 
said bus driver ziggy kucewicz who handed out buttons that played 
on the acronym for the transit authority nfta no funding 
today adios 
if the system shuts down i think its on their shoulders 
he said

scores of rioting prison inmates 
surrendered to authorities today and guards retook half of a 
victorian prison devastated by an uprising that one politician 
called the worst this century 
fortynine guards and prisoners were injured in the rioting 
sunday at the mediumsecurity strangeways prison one of europes 
most crowded today the prison looked like the scene of a bombing 
said ivor serle a chapter chairman of the prison officers 
association 
the prison is wrecked inside and will have to be virtually 
rebuilt he said it is like a building that has been blitzed 
firefighters working under police protection brought under 
control fires set in the chapel and a gymnasium but smoke still 
billowed from one corner of the building 
about a dozen inmates were huddled on the shattered roof of a 
100foothigh prison building in the rain this morning 
occasionally shouting abuse and hurling roof tiles into the yard 
below 
some wore prison officers shirts and several were wrapped in 
green prison blankets a helicopter clattered overhead continually 
in this northern industrial city 
earlier eyewitnesses said one prisoner climbed up on the roof 
dangling a police officers riot shield as a trophy 
the home office said all but 119 of the prisons 1648 inmates 
had surrendered by late morning guards seized half of the facility 
without a fight but inmates still controlled five of the prisons 
10 wings serle said 
serle said reports that 12 sex offenders were killed by other 
prisoners could not be confirmed he said no bodies had been found 
all guards were accounted for and no hostages were taken 
prisoners on the roof raised a flag late this afternoon saying 
no dead but home secretary david waddington told the house of 
commons that the possibility of deaths cannot be ruled out 
nine surrendering prisoners claimed to have been forcibly 
injected with drugs by other inmates waddington said 
the home office said 1458 inmates had been transferred to 
prisons throughout the country and 69 were awaiting transportation 
to other facilities 
the riot is the worst prison disturbance this century said 
a labor party spokesman barry sheerman strangeways is a ghastly 
place and conditions there are very difficult for the inmates and 
the staff 
strangeways an imposing redbrick and sandstone facility was 
built in 1868 for 970 men and three inmates are often crammed into 
a cell meant for one 
there was no clear indication of what caused the rioting which 
began during sunday morning service in the prison chapel when 
inmates grabbed keys from guards and used them to gain access to 
large areas of the facility 
the rev noel proctor an anglican minister who conducted the 
service said one inmate grabbed the microphone 
he started shouting at some of the lads and they started 
acting on and shouting back he was shouting obscenities and things 
like this is our opportunity 
initially police managed only to reach the chapel evacuating 
the injured using plastic shields to protect them from roof tiles 
hurled by prisoners 
john bartell president of the prison officers association 
accused the government of criminal negligence he said it was 
known from saturday that disturbances would break out but that 
only five officers were on duty in the prision chapel when the 
rioting broke out 
david evans also of the association described the prison as a 
war zone he said injured guards taken from the prison said 
some prisoners were killed 
i do not know how many but there have been people lying 
prostrate and not moving for hours he said 
twelve staff and 37 inmates were treated for injuries at 
hospitals home office spokesman charles keseru said 
evans said prison guards were injured trying to defend inmates 
from fellow prisoners he said guards had complained for years 
about squalor and overcrowding at strangeways and other 19th 
century jails 
george elliot a spokesman for the guards association said 110 
officers were on duty at the prison over the weekend compared with 
350 on an average weekday 
judge stephen tumim chief inspector of prisons said one shower 
a week was the norm for inmates at strangeways and the most 
dangerous inmates were locked up 22 hours a day 
they rarely left their cells save for slopping out weekly 
showers collecting meals and one hours exercise in a dirty 
yard tumim said in a report last week they could not use the 
main library or gymnasium library books sent to them were limited 
and in poor shape 
slopping out is the morning emptying of chamber pots by 
inmates whose cells do not have flush toilets 
the bestknown riot in british penal history this century was at 
dartmoor the grim jail built in 1809 on the moors of devon there 
a 1932 riot over poor food and conditions left 70 inmates and six 
guards injured

dozens of people arrested in one of londons worst 
riots were brought into court today while government and 
opposition leaders condemned the weekend violence that erupted 
during a peaceful antitax rally 
home secretary david waddington in charge of law enforcement 
told parliament he was outraged over acts of criminal violence 
and viciousness in saturdays riot around central trafalgar 
square that injured more than 400 people 
on sunday a local property tax was replaced by a percapita tax 
that opponents say favors the rich 
waddington said a team of 100 officers will conduct a major 
criminal investigation he said there was plenty of evidence 
in photographs and film to enable those responsible to be 
identified at least 341 people were arrested 
roy hattersley the opposition labor partys deputy leader 
condemned the rioting and said it was literally intolerable 
police said 68 of 341 people arrested in clashes in whitehall 
and around trafalgar square were being brought to five magistrates 
courts today the others were released pending trial 
police said the 68 were charged with public order offenses 
burglary theft and assault some were released on bail today 
among those appearing in court today were three men and a woman 
arrested sunday when waddington touring whitehall was met with 
protests his car was damaged by protesters who attacked him 
shouting no poll tax 
on saturday youths smashed windows set cars ablaze and battled 
police in whitehall and trafalgar square for six hours after a 
protest by 40000 people against a new tax denounced by opponents 
as favoring the rich 
authorities said 331 police and 86 civilians were hurt 
the rioting left the heart of london looking like a war zone 
cleanup crews cleared rubble and burnedout cars from the streets 
and strollers wandered past boardedup restaurants pubs and shops 
whose windows had been smashed 
on sunday prime minister margaret thatcher and opposition 
politicians agreed that a small group of extremists were to blame 
for turning what had been a peaceful protest against the new tax 
violent 
the demonstration organizers the all britain antipoll tax 
federation blamed small groups of troublemakers without 
specifically identifying them they also accused police of losing 
control 
the tax which took effect sunday in england and wales replaces 
a property tax with a levy on each adult critics say it is unfair 
because britains richest man pays the same amount as his gardener 
the new tax is part of mrs thatchers crusade to bury british 
socialism by hitting at its last bastion local government the 
levy which went into effect in scotland a year ago has been 
greeted with frequent demonstrations some violent 
critics have dubbed it the poll tax after a percapita tax that 
set off a peasants revolt in 1381

beverage industry has voluntarily agreed for many years not to 
advertise hard liquor on radio or television

mohawk indians today offered to let state 
police onto their land to investigate the shooting of a national 
guard helicopter it was the first sign of a break in their 
3dayold standoff 
state police negotiators were weighing the offer and considering 
their response officials said 
a doctor on a medical mission was wounded in the shooting 
friday and hundreds of state troopers with shotguns have blockaded 
the traditionalist indian community known as ganienkeh since then 
armed indians some with ak47 assault rifles were spotted 
inside the isolated woodland community of an estimated 40 families 
about 150 miles north of albany the indians have promised to 
defend their lands sovereignty with their lives 
the mohawks offered to let an independent investigative team 
onto the land if the investigators are escorted by mohawks and 
their findings are delivered immediately to both sides mohawk 
spokesman daryl martin said sunday 
martin said the proposal came after troopers granted an indian 
request to allow clan mothers from other mohawk communities to pass 
through the roadblocks for a meeting sunday 
a clan mother is a highly regarded individual in our society 
somebody who always has the interest of the land and her children 
at heart martin said 
this is a very serious matter and its important that all of 
the communities meet martin said they may have fresh ideas on 
how to solve this 
the indians have insisted that a 1794 treaty gives them the 
exclusive right to investigate crimes on their land they said they 
are willing to die over the issue 
busloads of people normally travel on weekends to the territory 
to play highstakes bingo but the buses were turned back at the 
roadblocks throughout the weekend 
on friday gunfire forced down a lowflying vermont national 
guard helicopter on a medical emergency flight dr james van kirk 
27 was wounded but was not seriously hurt he was discharged today 
from vermont medical center in burlington vt where he works 
the national guard flew the damaged helicopter off the indian 
land on sunday the mohawks had let a crew on the territory to 
repair the craft 
state police determined the shots were fired by a gunman 
standing near a building on the territory said maj robert leu 
martin insisted the shots did not come from the encampment 
the crew chief of the helicopter sgt kris samples saw a man 
fire a rifle at the chopper leu said another witness a man who 
had been driving a pickup truck and heard the shots corroborated 
samples account leu said 
the settlement has its roots in a centuriesold claim by the 
mohawks who say the land is among 9 million acres in new york and 
vermont wrongfully taken from them in the 18th century 
in 1974 a man and a 9yearold girl were shot and wounded while 
riding in cars near a mohawk encampment at moss lake and the 
indians also refused to cooperate 
troopers maintained a vigil outside the encampment for nearly 
three years eventually building a guard house but no arrests were 
made and negotiations ended with the mohawks moving to the site of 
fridays incident 
the state has sued the indians to try to close a bingo hall that 
opened in 1988

the american heart association under pressure 
from the federal government has decided to discontinue a food 
labeling program designed to help consumers quickly identify 
products considered best for the prevention of heart disease a 
spokesman said today 
the heartguide program an attempt by the heart association to 
identify and label lowfat lowcholesterol lowsodium foods came 
under attack by the federal food and drug administration which 
opposes endorsements by nongovernment groups 
the fda has made it clear it is against thirdparty 
endorsements howard lewis director of health and science news 
for the heart association said monday the governments only 
concern was that they did not like third party organizations 
entering into an area where they had legal responsibility 
lewis emphasized that only the labeling program will end 
nutrition education and other aspects of the program will continue 
the program was launched in january 
heartguide was proposed in 1987 as an attempt to uniformly 
identify foods with certain levels of cholesterol fat and sodium 
the foods were to be identified with a heartguide seal of 
approval a heart with a checkmark on the package 
consumer groups such as the center for science in the public 
interest expressed concern that consumers would be lulled by the 
label into believing that heartguideapproved foods were actually 
health foods those groups also complained about the fairness of 
the ratings 
the heart association planned to charge between 15000 and 
600000 a year to companies participating in the program the fees 
were to be used for a tollfree hotline and nutrition awareness 
programs the association said 
lewis said independent labs performed the food analyses after 
companies submitted applications to have foods considered 
he said the heart association was encouraged that the fda plans 
to overhaul the governments labeling program 
the fda has stated a commitment now to completely change the 
way food labeling is done in the country and to challenge and get 
rid of and set standards for such claims as low cholesterol high 
fiber lite things like that lewis said were very happy 
that after 17 years the government will move ahead 17 years 
after promises to do something about food labeling

ssociated press writerpluswashington ap the jury in john m 
poindexters trial began deliberating today whether the former 
national security adviser was guilty of withholding details of the 
irancontra affair from congress 
us district judge harold greene instructed the jury of eight 
women and four men to ignore the merits of president reagans 
policies of helping the nicaraguan rebels or selling arms to iran 
in an attempt to free american hostages 
its not for you to decide who was right in political disputes 
between congress and the president between democrats and 
republicans or between liberals and conservatives greene told 
the jury 
you are not called on to decide if the presidents policy 
toward iran and the american hostages was a wise or unwise 
policy the judge said he told them instead to focus on any 
evidence of particular crimes as distinct from broad policy 
poindexter who was reagans national security adviser from late 
1985 to november 1986 is accused of conspiring with former white 
house aide oliver l north and others to obstruct congressional 
inquiries about covert assistance given the contras and usiran 
arms sales 
he also faces charges of obstructing congress and making false 
statements to lawmakers 
in final arguments on friday defense lawyer richard beckler 
told jurors that poindexter a retired navy rear admiral was not 
part of some grimy little conspiracy that the prosecution would 
have you believe 
he tried to suggest that north went behind poindexters back 
saying there was absolutely many things that admiral poindexter 
didnt know oliver north was doing 
beckler told jurors that irancontra prosecutors produced as a 
witness only one of poindexters alleged coconspirators fawn 
hall and that the former white house secretary testified she only 
had a nodding acquaintance with the retired navy rear admiral 
but greene told jurors it was not necessary for prosecutors to 
prove that all the conspirators knew each other or that poindexter 
knew everything that other members of the alleged conspiracy were 
doing 
prosecutors must show that the defendant knew or had reason to 
know a conspiracy existed and actions were being taken to further 
its goals the judge said 
according to testimony by north and hall who was his secretary 
the two destroyed numerous irancontra documents as the diversion 
of usiran armssale profits to the contras was uncovered by 
investigators 
prosecutor dan webb said poindexter contributed to this 
rampage of destruction by deleting 5000 electronic messages in 
his office computer that contained a wealth of information about 
the irancontra affair 
investigators recovered the documents from a computer backup 
system 
poindexter met with north after he discovered that justice 
department investigators were coming over to the white house to 
look for documents during the weekend of nov 2123 1986 
according to testimony 
the prosecution contends that ms hall who was given immunity 
was part of the conspiracy because she helped north destroy or 
remove secret documents 
other alleged coconspirators who did not testify included 
poindexters predecessor as national security advisor robert 
mcfarlane and retired air force maj gen richard v secord both 
have pleaded guilty to irancontra charges and are cooperating with 
irancontra prosecutors 
beckler chided the prosecution for pinning the blame on 
poindexter for the efforts of the missing bud mcfarlane to 
mislead congress in 1985 about covert efforts to assist the 
nicaraguan contra rebels 
mcfarlane pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of withholding 
information from congress while north was convicted last year of 
aiding and abetting an obstruction of a congressional inquiry 
secord pleaded guilty to making a false statement to congress

yosef mendelevitch held up a piece of matzo 
symbolizing jewish freedom from slavery in ancient egypt and 
recited a blessing in hebrew 
about 100 new soviet immigrants in the room watched some with 
bewildered looks then they too broke off and ate for the first 
time in their lives a piece of passover matzo 
mendelevitch was teaching the passover traditions to the new 
arrivals in russian telling them about the unleavened matzo it 
commemorates the haste with which the israelites fled from the 
pharaohs army with no time to wait for their bread to rise 
they did not even recognize the story of moses in the 
bulrushes a story even nonjews know said mendelevitch who 
spent 11 years in a soviet prison for trying to get to israel 
passover begins this year at sundown april 9 the very presence 
of the soviet jews is viewed by israelis as a fulfillment of the 
prayer at the end of the passover story to meet next year in 
jerusalem 
but there is also an element of controversy because the soviet 
jews are living in gilo a jerusalem suburb built on land captured 
from jordan in the 1967 middle east war 
president bush recently criticized the settling of soviet 
immigrants on warwon land including east jerusalem saying it was 
an obstacle to making peace with the arabs 
leon shansviteh who arrived two months ago from baku in soviet 
azerbaijan said we have the right to live in gilo i dont 
understand president bush this area was empty until jews built 
here jerusalem is a jewish city 
reading from the haggada which recounts the exodus from egypt 
mendelevitch said there are similarities between the flight from 
the pharaohs oppression and todays flight of tens of thousands of 
jews from the soviet union 
in the passover story the pharaoh kept saying the jews could 
leave but whenever they tried he stopped them mendelevitch 
said then god sent him 10 plagues to convince him to let the 
jewish people go 
the same thing happened with soviet leaders in the kremlin 
mendelevitch said finally after world economic and medical 
sanctions they had no choice but to let us go 
spurred by reports of antisemitism in the soviet republics 
about 16000 soviet jews arrived in israel in the past year 
according to the american jewish committee the rate has reached 
more than 5000 per month 
mendelevitch was convicted and jailed in 1970 for attempting to 
hijack a plane and fly to israel after being denied an exit permit 
he was freed and came to israel in 1981 
a group of religious women arranged for mendelevitch to teach 
the traditions of the seder or passover dinner in an attempt to 
make entry into jewish culture easier for the immigrants 
white tableclothes long candlesticks and all the traditional 
dishes were on display hardboiled eggs horseradish lettuce 
parsley wine salt water and choroset a sweet pate of 
apples nuts and wine 
asa luzman who arrived a year ago from kiev with her husband 
daughter and soninlaw said i never knew anything about the 
holiday before i came to israel its such a shame 
a few like the shansviteh family only two months in israel 
were at home with the ceremonies even if they didnt join in the 
recitation of hebrew prayers 
shansvitehs grandfather an observant jew had led his familys 
passover seder from memory every year in baku 
in the soviet union it is very dangerous to hold a seder 
shansviteh said in halting hebrew 
an israel radio callin show matched 18000 newcomers with 
israeli hosts for the passover holiday 
many israelis celebrating the seder will speak of another 
miracle taking place said gad ben ari spokesman for the 
quasigovernmental jewish agency which raises funds and helps 
settle immigrants 
in the passover story the sea opened up to let the israelites 
cross and flee their oppressors two years ago the chance that the 
soviet government would let the jews out was just as unlikely

the supreme court said monday it will decide 
whether skyrocketing punitivedamage awards in personalinjury and 
other cases can go so high they become unconstitutional 
in a case of enormous importance to american business and 
consumers the court agreed to hear arguments in an alabama 
insurancefraud case that yielded a jury award of over 1 million 
the court must decide whether punitive damages aimed at 
punishing wrongdoers and deterring similar misconduct may be so 
large in some cases that they are fundamentally unfair a ruling is 
expected sometime in 1991 
in other action the court 
refused to expose car manufacturers to productliability 
lawsuits for not installing air bags suits against general motors 
honda and nissan motor corp were thrown out by lower courts and 
the justices declined to review them 
left intact a ruling that airlines say could impede mergers 
the justices in a case stemming from delta air lines acquisition 
of western airlines in 1986 refused to shield delta from binding 
arbitration in a dispute with the union that had represented 
westerns flight attendants 
turned down an appeal by a massachusetts church that said its 
religious freedom will be violated if state approval is required 
for the curriculum of a school it runs 
the court last year ruled that huge awards in civil lawsuits 
often millions of dollars do not violate the constitutions ban on 
excessive fines but the justices left open the possibility that 
such awards may be so disproportionate to the actual harm suffered 
that they violate dueprocess rights 
the constitution says states may not deprive anyone of property 
without due process of law those seeking to limit awards say due 
process prohibits unlimited discretion by judges and juries 
business leaders for years have clashed with lawyers and 
consumer groups over the legitimacy of huge judgments in civil 
cases 
those who oppose the bigmoney awards say they squelch american 
competitiveness and development of new products particularly new 
forms of medical treatment by discouraging risktaking 
they say juries capriciously penalize the wealthy to help those 
who have suffered serious injuries particularly if the wrongdoer 
is a giant corporation 
on the other side consumer activists and trial lawyers say 
punitive damages are a powerful deterrent to corporate greed that 
can threaten public safety and wellbeing they say smaller 
compensatory awards may be viewed by larger corporations as an 
acceptable cost of doing business 
recent studies show the size of punitive damages has climbed 
dramatically in recent years 
some state legislatures reacting to soaring insurance rates 
have put caps on how much money can be recovered in personalinjury 
cases those laws are not at issue directly in the case acted on 
monday 
the justices will hear an appeal by pacific mutual life 
insurance co found by a jury to have been responsible for fraud 
by one of its agents lemmie ruffin the company denied it had 
sanctioned ruffins conduct 
lower court records said employees of roosevelt city ala paid 
health insurance premiums to ruffin which he pocketed 
cleopatra haslip a city worker who had been paying premiums 
learned her insurance had lapsed after she incurred 2500 in 
hospital and medical bills in 1982 
the hospital demanded 600 before agreeing to discharge her and 
her doctor eventually turned her case over to a collection agency 
her credit also suffered from her inability to pay the bills 
mrs haslip and other members of the insurance plan sued pacific 
mutual and ruffin a jury in 1987 awarded her 1040000 three 
other roosevelt city employees were awarded a total of 38000 
it is not clear from records filed with the supreme court how 
much of the money was intended to compensate the workers for actual 
losses and how much was designed to punish the insurance company 
the alabama supreme court upheld the awards last year saying 
jury verdicts are presumed correct and that presumption is 
strengthened when the presiding judge refuses to grant a new 
trial 
pacific mutual said its constitutional rights were violated 
because the jury was allowed to award damages as a matter of 
moral discretion without adequate standards as to the amount 
necessary to punish and deter 
the company also contended it is the victim of unfair 
discrimination because alabama law imposes a cap on punitive 
damages in some cases

defense lawyers delayed jury selection this 
morning in the case of a black teenager slain by a mob of whites 
the lawyers questioned an assistant brooklyn district attorney 
and a police detective about lineups involving the suspects accused 
in the slaying 
prosecutors had said they were ready to open the trials of 
alleged triggerman joseph fama and keith mondello accused of being 
the ringleader of the young men charged in the aug 23 slaying of 
16yearold yusuf hawkins 
hawkins was shot after he went with three friends into the 
largely italian bensonhurst neighborhood in brooklyn to look at a 
used car 
fama and mondello are charged with murder and face 25 years to 
life in prison if convicted five others have been charged with 
murder and a sixth with assault they will stand trial later in 
groups 
last week assistant district attorney bruce mcintyre who had 
been slated to present opening arguments suddenly quit saying he 
resented being a token black at the prosecution table 
prosecutors suffered a major blow earlier in the month when a 
key witness and alleged participant in the attack reneged on a deal 
to cooperate john vento 21 decided to face murder charges rather 
than testify against his friends 
ventos unexpected defection had forced a onemonth delay in the 
start of the trials 
brooklyn district attorney charles j hynes says hes 
baffled by mcintyres resignation and regrets ventos change of 
heart but insists hes confident he has a case he can win 
judge thaddeus owens ruled that fama 19 and mondello 20 
would be the first to stand trial the judge planned to speed the 
proceedings by impaneling two juries that would sit side by side 
one deciding famas fate and the other mondellos 
the slaying caused a furor across the city it was seen as the 
most serious racial incident in the city since a 1986 attack in 
which a black man chased by a gang of whites in the howard beach 
neighborhood ran onto a highway and was killed by a car 
the bensonhurst slaying was apparently ignited by a dispute 
between mondello and a former girlfriend gina feliciano as word 
raced through the neighborhood that miss feliciano had invited 
black and hispanic friends to her 18th birthday party mondello 
allegedly recruited some friends to take on what they saw as 
intruders on their turf 
a gang of some 30 whites many armed with baseball bats mistook 
hawkins and his three teenage pals all black as the expected 
outsiders and set upon them 
as the gang surrounded the blacks fama allegedly stepped in 
with his gun and fired four shots three of which struck hawkins 
and killed him

a man accused of fatally poisoning his son 
in a scheme to collect damages from an infant formula maker goes on 
trial later this month in a case that languished until a us 
supreme court ruling cleared the way 
ricky irby 28 is charged with murdering his son quinten in 
1986 
irby says he was away when the poisoning occurred and contends 
the babys mother sheila smith fed him sulfuric acidlaced 
formula 
smith 27 whose murder trial begins in may says she had 
nothing to do with her sons death and has indicated the irby may 
have been involved 
the case might never have come to trial because of the 
disappearance of an opened can of formula and a bottle tainted with 
acid but the high court in 1988 ruled that evidence lost by 
accident does not preclude prosecution 
jury selection in irbys case was scheduled to begin today but 
was delayed until april 30 at the prosecutions request assistant 
lake county states attorney matthew chancey said he needed extra 
time to get information about additional witnesses defense 
attorneys plan to call to the stand he said he learned of the 
witnesses over the weekend 
the parents are being tried separately because of their 
antagonistic defenses prosecutors said they will seek the death 
penalty 
smith and irby are being held on 1 million bail each 
threemonthold quinten irby was poisoned in 1984 and lingered 
in a hospital for more than two years before dying at 2 
he suffered severe burns that scarred his mouth and trachea had 
one lung removed and remained on a respirator apparently comatose 
until his death 
prosecutors allege the parents forced the boy to drink sulfuric 
acid in a murderforprofit scheme in which a productliability 
lawsuit was filed against the maker of quintens baby formula irby 
filed the lawsuit in 1987 against abbott laboratories which 
denied the allegations but withdrew it a year later 
smith 27 was not a party to the lawsuit said her lawyer 
laureen cahill casey 
the bottle and can of formula were tested by toxicologist joerg 
pirl at a state crime laboratory but disappeared with pirls file 
in 1984 
pirl underwent hypnosis in an effort to find the evidence but 
the hypnotist later died and pirl could not recall what he had 
told the man ms casey said 
investigators later determined the evidence had been destroyed 
accidentally by a lab clerical worker and with no evidence the 
case essentially was closed but after the supreme court ruling 
smith and irby were indicted in 1989

an earthquake shook a broad swathe of england and 
wales today emptying buildings and sending hundreds of frightened 
people into the streets there were no immediate reports of 
injuries or serious damage 
the quake believed to be centered west of nottingham in central 
england was felt from the outskirts of london to south wales and 
north through birmingham coventry and manchester to the scottish 
border police stations around the country reported 
the british geological survey in edinburgh said it registered 
52 on the richter scale of ground motion the armenian earthquake 
in december 1988 which killed 25000 people measured 69 
leeds university scientists reported a reading of 4 
police switchboards were besieged by frightened callers 
following the temblor which struck between 245 pm and 250 pm 
buildings shook there were reports of cracks in walls and 
ornaments fell off shelves 
margaret hyde press officer of the greater manchester ambulance 
service said her office building in the city center was evacuated 
i felt the floor was moving underneath me it was like 
standing on a platform in a station and feeling a heavy train go 
past she said 
betty hill from a village near rugby in central england said 
i was sitting on a chair in the kitchen and saw the walls shake 
around me the chair itself shook bottles moved toward the edge of 
shelves everything rattled and a kitchen draw slid open 
then about three seconds after the first tremor finished just 
when i thought it was all over i felt another tremor the whole 
thing was very frightening 
two shrewsbury streets were closed one because of a gas leak 
and the other because of falling masonry authorities said 
i was really shocked things started to tumble off the shelves 
and smash the furniture started to move and i thought the house 
was about to collapse said barbara jordan of shrewsbury lots 
of women with their babies ran into the street to see what was 
going on 
bbc studios in cardiff wales were evacuated and there were 
reports of elevators stopping in highrise buildings as the tremor 
activated their automatic brakes 
two trials were suspended as the crown court was evacuated in 
mold wales 
in the past 10 years england and wales have been hit by more 
than 60 earthquakes which have registered more than 25 on the 
richter scale strong enough to be felt by people 
the strongest which registered 54 shook north wales in july 
1984 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 55 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 45

rival christian forces battled monday 
with artillery and rockets in beirut and the snowswept mountains 
northeast of the city in their fight for dominance of lebanons 
christian enclave 
the fighting broke out around midnight shattering a ceasefire 
brokered by vaticanbacked mediators only a few hours earlier 
snow blocked mountain roads and prevented gen michel aouns 
army troops and samir geageas lebanese forces militia from 
launching ground offensives 
at least a dozen fires blazed in the christian enclave in 
beirut several fuel storage tanks burned out of control fires 
spread near stocks at a large liquor factory which manufactures 
arak lebanons licoriceflavored national drink 
police said one person was wounded by sniper fire in east 
beiruts christian district of nabaa 
the battle for the 310squaremile christian enclave has left 
839 people dead and 2290 wounded since it began jan 30 police 
said 
thick smoke formed mushroom clouds over the snowcovered 
mountains of kesrouan province east of beirut as the two sides 
traded fire with rockets howitzers and tanks 
the cold weather snows and thick fog have prevented the 
warring factions from launching any ground attacks said a police 
spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity visibility is 
almost nil in the kesrouan mountains he said 
maronite catholic patriarch nasrallah sfeir continued talks with 
neutral christian leaders on ways of halting the confrontation 
aoun and geagea are members of the maronite sect which has 
dominated lebanese politics since the nations independence from 
france in 1943 
parliamentary deputy pierre helou talking to reporters after 
meeting with sfeir urged the government of syrianbacked president 
elias hrawi to spread state authority throughout lebanon 
as helou left the twostory hilltop stone monastery that houses 
sfeirs seat the thuds of exploding shells could be heard in the 
background 
the christian enclave was home to about one million people 
before the power struggle between aoun and geagea broke out 
police said at least 250000 people have fled the enclave to 
safer areas in the predominantly moslem sectors of lebanon or to 
neighboring syria or cyprus 
a christian security source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said he saw no solution to the fighting 
no one is willing to settle for anything less than a total 
victory which cannot be achieved he said 
the prestigious annahar newspaper said geagea in an effort to 
form an alliance against aoun offered to hand over the east beirut 
district of ashrafiyeh to hrawis government it did not disclose 
further details 
the report came two days after geageas fighters opened a 
crossing gateway linking beiruts moslem sector with ashrafiyeh 
unlike geagea aoun refuses to recognize hrawis authority he 
opposes a peace accord that led to hrawis election in november 
because it did not include a timetable for the withdrawal of syrian 
troops from lebanon 
also monday a fighter of the israelibacked south lebanon army 
militia was killed and two others were wounded when a roadside bomb 
exploded near their armored personnel carrier in south lebanon 
a security source speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
attack was reported near the village of beit yahoun within 
israels selfproclaimed security zone 
israel created the 6to10mile wide strip in 1985 when it 
withdrew the bulk of its invading army from lebanon 
the zone is patrolled by the south lebanon army militia and 
israeli troops and was designed to halt crossborder guerrilla 
attacks on northern israel

went on strike today at seven hospitals and more than 40 medical 
offices in southern california after weekend talks failed to 
produce a contract 
we have launched our strike and we are picketing at this 
moment at all of the facilities said doris boyd snyder first 
vice president of the service employees international union local 
399 well hold off until we get a better offer 
the union earlier rejected a threeyear offer from 
pasadenabased kaiser permanente the nations oldest and largest 
health maintenance organization kaiser has more than 2 million 
subscribers in southern california 
the union includes licensed vocational nurses clerks 
housekeepers and radiology technicians at seven of the kaiser 
permanente medical centers and more than 40 satellite medical 
offices in los angeles and orange counties 
at kaisers anaheim hospital more than 100 workers quietly 
walked the picket lines this morning carrying blackandwhite on 
strike signs 
most of us here have ourselves and families to support its 
hard on both sides said joyce johnston a licensed vocational 
nurse 
kaiser will borrow workers from facilities unaffected by the 
strike said janice seib a spokeswoman for the hmo she said many 
patients had already been transferred out of kaiser hospitals and 
nonemergency surgery had been postponed

nearly one in every six american women in the 
normal childbearing age group has been surgically sterilized as a 
method of birth control a government report shows 
the results of the national center for health statistics study 
indicate that nearly as many women 15 to 44 opt for sterilization 
as choose to use the birth control pill figures on abortion were 
not included 
the study which provides the most recent contraceptive data 
available found that 166 percent of those women interviewed had 
been sterilized while 185 percent used the pill 
in 1982 about 13 percent of women in that age range had been 
surgically sterilized 
the number of men who chose to be sterilized rose only slightly 
from 61 percent in 1982 to 7 percent in 1988 
the centers dr william d mosher said monday that the increase 
in sterilization largely involves women 30 and older who want no 
more children 
we know from other research that by age 30 or so that 
about threequarters of women who have been married have had all 
the births they want mosher said in a telephone interview 
they have 10 to 15 years left when it is physically possible 
to conceive but they dont want to thats a long time at risk of 
pregnancy but wanting no more births 
however mosher said the continuing increase in sterilization 
keeps surprising me 
the highest rate of surgical sterilization 325 percent was 
among women 35 to 44 the report said by comparison just 16 
percent of those 15 to 24 had undergone sterilization the rate is 
166 percent in the 26 to 34 age group 
most of those women have used the pill in the past and want a 
form of contraception that is as effective he said that limits 
them to resuming use of the birth control pill or sterilization for 
themselves or their partner 
use of the pill is discouraged for women who smoke are over 35 
or have health problems 
female sterilization is getting easier and safer so for a 
lot of couples it probably seems the only sensible choice mosher 
said 
nearly onefourth of all currently married women 234 percent 
had been sterilized surgically the study found that was an 
increase from 187 percent in 1982 
among widowed divorced and separated women the rate was even 
higher 292 percent in 1988 up from 218 percent six years 
earlier only 27 percent of single women had been sterilized but 
that was up from 13 percent in 1982 
more single women the study found are requiring their partners 
to use condoms condom use has been stressed in recent years as a 
method to avoid sexually transmitted disease 
use of condoms by nevermarried women doubled from 41 percent 
in 1982 to 82 percent in 1988 for married women it rose from 94 
percent to 106 percent in the same period 
i think the other thing that surprised me was that there 
wasnt more condom use among nevermarried women mosher said 
birth control pills remained the leading method used by single 
women 247 percent in 1988 compared with 187 percent in 1982 
female sterilization was the most common method of birth control 
for widows and formerly married women mosher said 
the studys figures on sterilization were for women who chose 
sterilization as a method of birth control in addition 47 
percent of women in the 15 to 44 age group were sterile as a result 
of surgery performed for other reasons 
the report by the center a division of the department of health 
and human services was based on 1988 interviews with 8450 women 
across the country the margin of error varies but all results 
were considered statistically reliable at a 95 percent confidence 
level 
here is a rundown of the major methods of contraception and the 
percentage of women 15 to 44 using them in 1988 and 1982 the total 
does not add to 100 because many women do not use contraception

the bush administration said monday its 
getting very serious about energy conservation and environmental 
issues it suggested were given short shrift under president reagan 
secretary of energy james d watkins made the assessment as he 
released an interim report on an energy strategy his department 
plans to submit to president bush in december 
the 230page report summarized views expressed in 12000 pages 
of testimony taken at 15 public hearings that began in august 
the hardest choices lie ahead watkins said if we can 
finish a product that will make everybody equally unhappy we will 
have done our job 
the report draws no conclusions but presents an array of 
possibilities and lists potential obstacles including objections 
of industry groups 
the loudest single message was to increase energy efficiency 
in every sector of energy use watkins said energy efficiency 
was seen as a way to reduce pollution reduce dependence on oil 
imports and reduce the cost of energy 
in response to a question watkins said environmental concerns 
would be a significant factor in shaping the final report 
i dont think the department has been that forthcoming in those 
areas in the past and we are getting very serious about it at the 
direction of the president he said 
the report calls for examination of strict conservation 
requirements and governmentfinanced development of renewable 
alternative energy sources such as hydroelectric dams and 
geothermal power 
reagan stoutly opposed such measures arguing that energy issues 
should be left to the marketplace he even advocated doing away 
with the energy department 
bush in asking for the energy strategy said a keystone of 
this strategy is going to be the continuation of the successful 
policy of market reliance 
the report nevertheless lists scores of ideas calling for a more 
active government role including industry regulation 
among them 
new or heightened government efforts to find new energy 
sources including solar nuclear fusion safer and cheaper nuclear 
fission and alternative fuels such as liquefied natural gas 
methanol and ethanol for automobiles 
more demanding government fuel efficiency standards for 
automobiles requiring the manufacture of more compact vehicles 
higher efficiency standards for appliances and other electrical 
devices including home and office lights 
a return to energyoriented tax breaks ranging from special 
allowances for domestic oil explorers to new incentives for 
homeowners to install better insulation and solar heating systems 
the interim report said reliance on foreign oil continues to 
soar despite remarkable strides in efficency since the oil crises 
of the 1970s 
watkins said the best estimate is that us energy efficiency 
could be increased by 10 percent to 12 percent by early in the next 
century if present policies are followed he said the department 
believes that can be doubled by following some of the steps 
outlined in the report

nelson mandela toured a 
violencewracked black township in natal province today and 
appealed for an end to factional battles that have kept blacks from 
uniting to fight white minority rule 
president fw de klerk today announced heavier security in the 
southeastern province including more troops searches roadblocks 
and possibly more detentions 
officials say fighting in natal between supporters of mandelas 
african national congress and inkatha a zulu organization left at 
least 53 people dead and hundreds injured since last tuesday 
we are not fighting inkatha we are fighting apartheid and the 
forces of oppression mandela told 2000 people crammed into a 
church hall in edendale at least 13000 people fled their homes 
around edendale after rival factions burned hundreds of houses 
police said refugees were sheltered at churches schools and 
community centers 
police maj piet kitching said the situation was very tense 
and serious fighting could erupt at any time rival factions 
battled sunday with automatic weapons and police patrols were 
ambushed officials said 
mandela anc deputy president also said today he will meet 
president fw de klerk on thursday to discuss ways to end the 
violence 
mandela who has acknowledged differences with other anc 
leaders decided to meet de klerk despite the anc decision to pull 
out of talks april 11 
the anc canceled the meeting because police shot and killed at 
least nine demonstrators last week in the black township of 
sebokeng near johannesburg the organization said it would 
reconsider entering talks once the government curbs the police 
de klerk addressing parliament in cape town today also said he 
and mandela will meet this week he criticized the anc for pulling 
out of the april 11 meeting and for its continued commitment to a 
guerrilla campaign 
it is difficult to understand why an organization saying it is 
interested in peace refuses to come and talk about that very 
issue de klerk said 
de klerk said security forces will play a more visible role 
setting up roadblocks and patrolling troubled areas by road and 
helicopter he said security forces will play a more visible role 
setting up roadblocks and patrolling troubled areas by road and 
helicopter 
everyone must understand that these decisions could lead to a 
rise in the number of people being detained de klerk said 
more than 30000 people have been detained for varying lengths 
of time under a state of emergency in effect since june 1986 
however no more than a few dozen people presently are in detention 
in his address de klerk also said the government will propose 
legislation that would free more prisoners convicted of politically 
motivated acts 
no details were released but such legislation would presumably 
free hundreds of imprisoned activists and allow exiled members of 
mandelas african national congress to return without fear of 
prosecution 
rival zulu tribe factions of the ancallied united democratic 
front and the conservative inkatha movement have been fighting for 
control of rural areas of natal hundreds of people have been 
killed in the fighting 
inkatha leader mangosuthu buthelezi met today with church 
leaders including anglican archbishop desmond tutu and said they 
were biased in favor of the anc and its ally the united democratic 
front 
quite honestly you are wasting your time here buthelezi 
told the church leaders go to those peole who have 
recommitted the anc to intensifying the armed struggle 
buthelezi accused the anc of cowardice for backing out of 
talks with the government and reaffirmed his readiness to 
negotiate 
de klerk legalized the anc and other black opposition groups in 
february to try and the clear the way for ending apartheid and 
building a new political structure

they wouldnt do it voluntarily dorney park attorney

i cant believe these guys said bob bennett president and 
general manager of six flags its ridiculous if you talk to 
anybody in this business they measure a ride from the ground to the 
top of the lift 
wrong stevens said you measure the length of the drop after 
you get to the top 
it doesnt make any difference how long it takes to go up it 
matters how long it is coming down stevens said we built our 
roller coaster over a cliff

a shiite moslem leader denied monday that 
a recent visit by the brother of iranian president hashemi 
rafsanjani was related to the 18 western hostages held by 
underground shiite factions 
mahmoud hashemis visit late last month to lebanon was for 
humanitarian purposes and not linked to the hostages said a 
statement by hussein mousawi one of the shiite lebanese leaders 
who met rafsanjanis brother 
the conservative newspaper addiyar based in christian east 
beirut had reported that hashemi met in the eastern bekaa valley 
last week with mousawi and leaders of the iranianbacked hezbollah 
or party of god 
hezbollah is an umbrella for shiite groups holding the western 
hostages 
rafsanjani has in the past assigned his brother to sensitive 
missions addiyar suggested that his visit to the syrianpoliced 
bekaa valley was related to the issue of the western hostages 
the statement by mousawi who heads the islamic amal or islamic 
hope movement described addiyars report as fantasy islamic 
amal is closely associated with hezbollah but is not known to hold 
hostages 
the iranian embassy has withheld comment on hashemis visit to 
lebanon the latest in a series since president rafsanjani took 
office aug 3

president bush today appealed to broadcasters to 
stand for freedom and support efforts to beam television 
broadcasts into cuba even though they could suffer retaliation 
bush in a speech to the national association of broadcasters 
convention signalled his strong support for the fledgling 
broadcast efforts of tv marti which castro began jamming as soon 
as it first went on the air march 27 
castro has threatened to retaliate by interfering with american 
broadcast signals of stations in florida 
i do understand the concerns some of you have about this but 
i also understand that you represent the very principle tv marti 
exists to serve the free flow of ideas said the president 
i ask you to stand by your traditions the best traditions of 
america i ask you once again to stand for tv marti to stand for 
freedom said bush 
by asking broadcasters for support bush was talking to those 
who would be most affected by any cuban retaliation to tv marti 
on march 23 as us authorities were gearing up to begin tv 
marti broadcasts cuba broadcast a radio speech by castro to the 
united states am stations along the florida coast and as far away 
as nashville were disrupted 
broadcasters however were skeptical of the presidents appeal 
edward o fritts president of the national association of 
broadcasters said its castros threat of jamming am stations 
that worries us 
he said that while us am radio stations are limited to 50000 
watts castro has the ability to go to 1 million wats he said 
the cubans could theoretically jam radio stations literally across 
the nation 
he also said that the tv marti transmitter itself stationed on 
a balloon in south florida was causing television interference to 
florida stations from miami to jacksonville 
later bush flew to cincinnati and toured the ge aircraft 
engines plant in evendale ohio where the engines for the new air 
force one jumbo jet were made the plant also recently signed a 
deal to sell engines to the soviet airline aeroflot bush said that 
shows the worlds come a long way he will also make stops in 
indianapolis and detroit on tuesday 
bush embarking on a twoday fourstate trip mixing political 
fundraising with public appearances stressing competitiveness and 
conservation applauded the role television and radio broadcasts 
played in inspiring the democratic revolutions that shook the 
communist world over the past year 
television which began as the american forum has become the 
world forum said bush 
and so when a lone brave man stood up to a column of tanks in 
tiananmen square the world stood with him when the people of 
prague sang the first christmas carols in over 40 years the world 
sang with them and when the first german took the first hammer to 
that wall of shame in berlin the world shared in that historic act 
of courage said bush 
he said tv marti was the latest addition to the arsenal of 
american efforts to broadcast the truth to communist countries 
the voice of freedom will not be stilled as long as there is 
an america to tell the truth said bush who also praised other 
us government broadcast outlets including radio marti radio 
liberty radio free europe and the voice of america 
echoing recent praise of voice of america by czechoslovakias 
new president vaclav havel bush said i am convinced that the 
people of cuba will thank us when they too win the liberty they 
yearn for 
bush said he could envision a time when the purpose of radio 
free europe and radio liberty could be utterly fulfilled but for 
now these networks along with usias worldnet and voa must 
continue in eastern europe until change is complete 
he said he has ordered an interagency review of the us 
government international broadcasts 
he delivered the speech in the world congress center home of 
the 1988 democratic convention and nextdoor neighbor to the 
headquarters of the cable news network 
his main event in cincinnati will be a fundraiser for george 
voinovich the former cleveland mayor who is seeking to become 
ohios first republican governor since 1978 
on tuesday bush flies to indianapolis to plant a tree at an 
arbor day ceremony and campaign for sen dan coats rind trying 
to win election to the seat he was appointed to last year when dan 
quayle became vice president

a man accused of killing his exwife 
while he was on an eighthour prison leave went on trial monday in 
a case that forced the governor to overhaul the prison furlough 
program 
jury selection began for alan lehman matheney 39 who was 
serving an eightyear sentence for assaulting his former wife lisa 
marie bianco on the day he allegedly chased her from her home and 
clubbed her to death 
although a gag order prevents comments by the prosecution and 
defense matheneys lead attorney scott l king has suggested he 
will argue that his client was insane 
prosecutors say ms bianco 29 fled her home in terror on march 
4 1989 pursued by a man with a 410gauge shotgun to a neighbors 
closed front door 
there her assailant clubbed her to the ground and holding the 
shotgun barrel in both hands he struck her at least 15 more times 
shattering the wooden stock authorities said she died of a broken 
skull 
ms biancos daughters then ages 6 and 10 were at home when 
the attack occurred and may be called to testify 
matheney surrendered to police later that afternoon around the 
time his furlough from a central indiana prison was to expire 
ms bianco who had served as a counselor to battered women was 
mourned at her furneral by the women she had counseled they said 
she had emerged from a broken and violent relationship with new 
courage and compassion and still lost 
gov evan bayh a democrat mindful of national republicans use 
of prison furloughs as a presidential political issue immediately 
suspended the states furlough program and ordered an investigation 
bayh who urged the prosecution to seek the death penalty later 
tightened restrictions in the indiana prison furlough system to 
block the release of prisoners under similar circumstances 
attorneys at matheneys 1987 sentencing described the marriage 
as an obsessive relationship of love and hate ms bianco yearned 
to be free of him 
if only i could get him put away for a year i could put my 
life back together again she said at one point 
only days before her death though she admitted to friends 
that although she could never again live with matheney she still 
loved him 
matheney allegedly made threatening telephone calls even from 
prison she asked authorities to inform her upon his release 
fearing his freedom would eventually cost her her life 
matheney and bianco divorced in 1985 ending their sevenyear 
marriage but not their hostilities in may 1987 matheney was 
convicted of criminal confinement after he disappeared for six 
weeks with their daughters brooke and nicole 
the judge accused matheney of using the children then 6 and 2 
as pawns in an unsuccessful custody battle he was sentenced to two 
years in prison 
three months later matheney pleaded guilty to assaulting ms 
bianco at his home rape and confinement charges were dropped in 
exchange for the guilty plea but matheney blamed her for the 
unexpectedly stiff eightyear sentence 
guards at his minimum to mediumsecurity prison near pendleton 
called matheney a wellbehaved inmate but during the six weeks 
before ms biancos death he was refused a furlough six times 
finally on march 4 he was released into the custody of his 
mother martha matheney and told not to leave central indiana ms 
bianco was not told of his release 
despite the travel order the matheneys drove north to the home 
of a friend authorities said there matheney got the shotgun and 
headed for ms biancos home to retrieve audiotapes he believed she 
had recorded of their phone conversations authorities said 
matheney said he couldnt explain why he carried the shotgun and 
refused to answer when asked whether he had killed ms bianco he 
would only say that her death resulted from an argument that got 
out of hand 
the trial is expected to last at least two weeks

ryan white the young aids patient whose 
rejection by hometown classmates brought him sympathy and support 
all over the world was reported near death today a state official 
said 
white 18 was in critical condition this afternoon at riley 
hospital for children and was not expected to survive internal 
bleeding that has left him unconscious said carrie van dyke 
director of health promotion for the state board of health 
this is it hes not expected to come out of it van dyke 
told the associated press in a telephone interview hes not 
responding 
i dont think its the aids as much as hes a hemophiliac and 
hes bleeding internally and thats the problem van dyke said 
white was diagnosed as having aids in december 1984 when he was 
13 he contracted acquired immune deficiency syndrome through a 
bloodclotting agent used to treat his hemophilia 
the following year he was barred from western middle school 
near kokomo after school officials and parents there rejected 
health authorities reassurances that aids cannot be spread through 
casual contact 
after months of school board battles and court hearings white 
won the right to attend school 
however pressures on his family later drove the whites to the 
town of cicero where he was enrolled at hamilton heights high 
school in cicero townspeople and fellow students rallied around 
him and befriended him 
he has become a national spokesman for children with aids 
appearing at congressional hearings and fundraisers and the story 
of his life was told in a 1989 television movie white had a small 
role in the film 
white was befriended by such celebrities as michael jackson 
white was admitted to riley hospital on thursday said hospital 
spokeswoman mary maxwell 
van dyke said the hemophilia a disorder that impairs bloods 
ability to clot prevented doctors from taking extraordinary 
measures that would prolong whites life 
he celebrated his birthday in december in ill health with a low 
blood platelet count and staph infections in his eyes and legs 
but he continued his efforts to help fellow aids patients 
last week he appeared with former president reagan and his 
wife nancy at a los angeles event sponsored by athletes and 
entertainers for kids which established the ryan white national 
program for aids education in his honor 
van dyke said she had became close to white while they prepared 
publicservice announcements for world aids day in december

chancellor helmut kohl tried to 
placate angry east germans on monday after the head of bonns 
central bank suggested swapping east german marks 2to1 for west 
german marks 
postal workers in the east german city of suhl held a warning 
strike monday to press for a 1to1 exchange rate east germanys 
labor union federation urged a nationwide demonstration thursday 
east germans were expecting to get a powerful west german mark 
for each of their east german marks under a common currency 
expected to be worked out sometime this summer 
karl otto poehl the influential head of west germanys central 
bank the bundesbank suggested the 2to1 conversion rate 
the suggestion raised allegations kohl was breaking campaign 
promises made before the march 18 east german elections an 
alliance favoring quick reunification won the vote in part because 
of campaigning by kohl 
both german states have agreed to set up a common currency as a 
crucial step toward unification with west germany eventually 
taking over east germanys economic policies bonn would like the 
currency union in place by july 1 
kohl said monday his government will carefully examine the 
bundesbanks recommendation and insisted no decision had been 
made on what exchange rate to use 
the chancellor said he recognizes his responsibility to the 
people of east germany saying i have repeatedly underlined 
this commitment to solidarity during the east german election 
campaign and i stand by it 
during the campaign kohl promised that east german private 
savings would not be decimated by monetary union he said east 
germans would be protected from economic shocks when the currency 
union takes effect 
but the bundesbank repeated its demand that east german marks be 
exchanged 2to1 with the exception of a 1to1 conversion for 
personal savings of up to 2000 eastern marks 
a conversion rate of 1to1 would expose the east german 
economy to an indebtedness and a cost level with which most 
companies couldnt cope in international competition the 
bundesbank said in a statement 
financial experts have previously cautioned that many east 
german factories and shops would not be able to afford wages and 
pensions if east german marks were traded for western marks at 
parity there have been forecasts up to 2 million east germans 
could lose their jobs 
the bundesbank controls the west german money supply it has 
demanded full control of east german monetary policy when currency 
union occurs 
the bundesbank also wants limits on new borrowings by the east 
german public sector 
there were clear signs of tension between kohls government and 
the bundesbank over the issue of conversion rates 
helmut haussmann west germanys economics minister said a 
decision on conversion rates will be made by the government and not 
by the bank 
the bundesbank has made a recommendation the decision will be 
made by politics he told the masscirculation bild newspaper 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher said the bundesbanks 
recommendations do not mark the last word on a conversion rate 
genscher said that for east german pensions especially a more 
favorable rate must be considered than 2to1 
that is not acceptable how could anyone be expected to live 
with such a pension genscher said in an interview with 
deutschlandfunk radio 
lothar de maiziere east germanys premierdesignate warned the 
east german exodus to west germany could swell again if his 
countrymen sense monetary union could do them more harm than good 
in that case we would be able to keep the people here only 
with great difficulties said de maiziere

president fw de klerk said 
monday he would send police and military reinforcements to a 
troubled province where hundreds of blacks have died in a virtual 
civil war between rival factions 
de klerk also said he would meet african national congress 
leader nelson mandela on thursday and he proposed an amnesty for 
politically motivated criminal acts 
he criticized the anc for pulling out of talks with the 
whiteled government and for its continued commitment to a 
guerrilla campaign 
it is difficult to understand why an organization saying it is 
interested in peace refuses to come and talk about that very 
issue de klerk told parliament in cape town 
the anc announced saturday it was postponing talks in protest of 
a march 26 police shooting of black demonstrators in sebokeng a 
township south of johannesburg at least nine people were killed 
and 400 were injured 
de klerk said police and military units were being strengthened 
in the southeastern province of natal the scene of fierce fighting 
between rival groups of blacks in recent weeks 
the security forces will play a more visible role setting up 
roadblocks and patrolling troubled areas by road and helicopter de 
klerk said 
everyone must understand that these decisions could lead to a 
rise in the number of people being detained he added 
more than 30000 people have been detained without trial for 
varying lengths of time under a state of emergency in effect since 
june 1986 however no more than a few dozen people presently are 
in detention 
de klerk warned black radicals and extremist whites that we 
are deadly serious about building the new south africa without 
brutality and without unrest 
de klerk said the violence is jeopardizing plans to arrange 
blackwhite negotiations on a new constitution 
the maintenance of law and order can never be compared to 
anarchistic violence he said therefore purposeful and strong 
action will be taken to maintain good order 
mandela renewed his appeal for peace during a visit to edendale 
a natal township that has been the site of some of the worst 
fighting 
we are not fighting inkatha a rival black group mandela 
told 2000 people crammed into a church hall we are fighting 
apartheid and the forces of oppression 
police in natal said vicious battles between anc supporters and 
inkatha a relatively conservative zulu organization had left at 
least 53 people dead and hundreds injured since last tuesday local 
reporters said the death toll could range up to 100 
the two organizations have been fighting for supremacy in natal 
since 1986 resulting in some 4000 deaths in natal both the anc 
supporters and inkatha members are zulus neutral observers blame 
both groups for the violence 
in his speech to parliament de klerk said the government will 
propose legislation allowing authorities to grant amnesty for 
politically motivated criminal acts 
the full details were not released but it appeared such 
legislation if enacted would allow the government to free 
hundreds of imprisoned activists and permit exiled anc members to 
return to south africa without fear of prosecution the release of 
imprisoned activists is a leading demand of the anc and other 
organizations 
de klerk said cases would be considered individually and 
blanket indemnity is not being considered 
but he added with these steps the government proves it is not 
blind to the problems of the moment the groundwork for the 
creation of a climate conducive to negotiation must continue 
the government released seven anc prisoners monday from robben 
island prison off cape town more than 50 activists have been freed 
in the past two months 
de klerk legalized the anc and other black opposition groups in 
february to try to clear the way for negotiations on a new 
constitution that will include the countrys 28million black 
majority

the us embassy on monday denied 
allegations it tried to kidnap from jail an air force sergeant 
convicted of killing his wife 
us military efforts to gain custody of the man have angered 
dutch officials 
the controversy stems from an incident friday night when eight 
us enlisted men and officers came to the utrecht jail where staff 
sgt charles d short is housed the dutch high court was to rule 
on his extradition the same day 
the court later ruled against the us extradition request 
because short 34 of highwood ill could face the death penalty 
in the united states for the 1988 slaying 
the americans were spotted by prison guards who called the 
police reports said they were then told to leave 
the episode made frontpage news in several major dutch 
newspapers the nations most reputable newspaper nrc handelsblad 
described it as a kidnapping attempt in its headline 
the americans are way off the mark here they should keep 
their paws off short or else therell be a serious diplomatic 
incident said an unidentified justice ministry spokesman on 
dutch television 
on monday the us embassy in the hague said the eight unarmed 
servicemen including shorts commander a legal officer three 
military policemen and three drivers had been waiting for him at 
the jail 
the statement said the men had orders to take short into custody 
only if extradition were approved 
there was never any intent on the part of usaf officials to 
apprehend staff sgt short without the full authorization and 
consent of the netherlands authorities the statement said 
justice ministry spokesman victor holtus said negotiations with 
us officials were still going on in the case but he would not 
disclose details 
a dutch court sentenced short to six years imprisonment oct 
11 1988 on homicide charges he was convicted of killing his 
turkishborn wife esin hasturk cutting her body into pieces and 
dumping the remains in plastic bags 
an appeals court in amsterdam ruled later that the dutch legal 
system has no jurisdiction over short that could lead to his 
release 
dutch law which has no capital punishment bans extradition 
when a suspect might be executed

the number of political prisoners in soviet mental 
institutions may have declined sharply but the abuse of 
psychiatric practices remains widespread an international group 
said monday 
the abuses continue and the abusers are still in place the 
international association on the political use of psychiatry said 
in a statement 
robert van voren the general secretary of the netherlands 
group said the situation in the soviet union remains a cause of 
concern 
van voren who recently visited the soviet union said 
affiliated groups in that nation have files on 40 political 
prisoners kept in psychiatric hospitals that compares with about 
1000 five years ago 
he said it was not possible to estimate the total number of 
political prisoners under psychiatric care because many patients 
were being shifted to remote areas 
it is clear that authorities are still trying to cover up 
abuses he said 
van voren said the soviet interior ministry still maintains 
control over what he estimated to be more than 1000 psychiatric 
hospitals throughout the country 
there are still watchtowers with machine guns still guards 
with dogs still barbed wire and doctors are still holding 
military ranks at those hospitals he said 
van voren said the situation in most of the hospitals has not 
improved since mikhail s gorbachev came to power in 1985 recently 
instituted legal changes give only theoretical rights to 
patients van voren said 
he hailed the formation of independent psychiatric associations 
in moscow leningrad and estonia and said there were very strong 
attempts by lawyers and activists to reform soviet psychiatry 
van voren said the soviet media have been writing openly about 
current abuses including a case in which a declared candidate in a 
local election was taken to a psychiatric hospital on orders from 
the opposing communist party candidate 
but he said the leadership of the official soviet allunion 
society for psychiatry has remained in power despite promises from 
the organization for changes when it was readmitted to the world 
psychiatric association in october 
van vorens group opposed that readmission and said monday it 
would be a good thing to reconsider that membership

in the days before he was gunned down on a 
memphis motel balcony martin luther king jr was a pressured 
worried man who found himself the leader of a slowing movement 
according to aides king was on a roller coaster of optimism and 
doubt he was still getting criticism for a 1967 speech against the 
war in vietnam and was troubled because he had been unable to keep 
a memphis tenn march from turning into a riot he worried about 
young blacks new appetite for violence 
nearly 22 years after a snipers bullet killed king on april 4 
1968 his last days have generated renewed interest in part 
because of his closest aides contention that king spent time with 
two women on the night before he died 
the rev ralph david abernathys account of april 3 1968 has 
been condemned as false by other black leaders and a woman who says 
she served dinner to king at her home that night abernathy who 
spent the entire civil rights movement with king stood by his 
version as true 
abernathy said he decided to reveal kings alleged activities 
because he wanted to portray his friends human side 
but that human side according to friends and biographers 
already was evident by late march 1968 
king felt other black leaders no longer trusted his judgment 
they had rained criticism on him for his april 4 1967 speech 
against the vietnam war 
he was concerned and troubled by people who were supposed to 
be close to him and had been his colleagues but didnt share his 
position on the war in vietnam said rep john lewis dga a 
former student activist who worked with king through the student 
nonviolent coordinating committee 
but lewis said he saw king frequently in the spring of 1968 and 
i never saw him in a state of depression he was looking forward 
to organizing and mobilizing 
king aide hosea williams a former atlanta city councilman said 
other black leaders placed all the pressure in the world on 
king for his antiwar position 
he was having some real problems he suffered severely 
williams said 
abernathy said king was depressed before his death when a 
protest he led in memphis in late march 1968 turned into a riot 
king worried that people no longer would adhere to nonviolence as 
a tool for social change 
he wondered if he should step aside and let violence run its 
course abernathy wrote in his 1989 autobiography and the 
walls came tumbling down 
king returned to memphis on april 3 1968 to prove you could 
still have a nonviolent peaceful march planned for april 5 on 
behalf of striking memphis trash collectors 
the night he arrived king delivered his mountaintop speech 
he was at the height of his powers abernathy wrote i 
never saw him better 
afterward according to abernathy king went to dinner at the 
home of a female friend and went into a bedroom with her for about 
two hours adjua abi naantaanbuu of memphis known then as tarlease 
mathews agrees that king and abernathy came to her home but she 
says it was abernathy who went into the bedroom and passed out 
from having too much to drink 
she has filed a 10 million libel suit against abernathy and his 
publisher harper amp row 
abernathy said king later spent part of the night with another 
woman and then got into a pushing match with a third 
biographer stephen b oates wrote in his 1982 book let the 
trumpet sound that king went back to the lorraine motel after 
his speech and was relaxed and happy while he worked on sermons 
according to biographer david garrow king went to dinner at the 
home of naacp leader benjamin hooks then returned to the hotel 
where he chatted and joked with his brother ad until nearly 
dawn 
on his last day former aides say king was cheerful optimistic 
and playful according to garrows book bearing the cross 
king pummeled andrew young in an impromptu pillow fight hours 
before his assassination 
occasionally he would get in those kinds of hilarious moods 
recalled young the former atlanta mayor

in play money on the line monday opening his 1 billion taj mahal 
casino resort for a dry run where the only real action fed the slot 
machines 
outside on the boardwalk the crowd gathered until security 
guards stepped aside at 10 am and let visitors onto the 
120000squarefoot casino floor for the first time 
im amazed to see how many people are here at this time of the 
morning trump said shaking employees hands and autographing 
mock 10 bills patrons must use until state gaming regulators give 
the goahead for real money 
slot machines needing no breakin period were open for cold 
cash 
gamblers said they came from all over the country attracted by 
the chance to see trumps third casino a 17acre site with 14 
million in chandeliers alone 1250 rooms and more than 3000 slot 
machines 
i figured this would be pretty remarkable so i took the day 
off said brent blanchard 27 of palmyra 
trump accompanied by three bodyguards arrived five minutes 
after the opening and led about 30 reporters and dozens more 
curiosity seekers on a 20minute tour 
about 50 state division of gaming enforcement investigators went 
into action checking whether dealers knew their games and that 
proper internal controls surveillance and accounting procedures 
were in place 
the division reports its findings to the casino control 
commission after the casino closes and the commission decides 
whether to allow limited table betting with real money on tuesday 
or extend the test period 
new jersey regulations require new casinos to use play money at 
table games such as craps blackjack and baccarat during test 
periods 
patrons can buy 10 worth of play money for 1 in real money 
the gamblers get to win more play money and the casinos take goes 
to seven local charities 
patrons seemed more interested in spotting trump than in trying 
their luck in the casino named after a 16th century indian 
mausoleum one woman shrieked i touched him in the middle of 
his zigzag tour of the casino floor 
patrons issued a mixed verdict on the impact of atlantic citys 
largest casino a third larger than the 90000squarefoot 
tropworld entertainment and casino resort 
some said they only came for a first peek at a casino that has 
been under construction for eight years and must win at least 1 
million a day to service the debt on 675 million in bonds 
one minor controversy marred an otherwise perfect media event 
the riviera casino in las vegas disputed trumps claim that his new 
casinos 120000squarefoot gaming floor is the worlds largest 
riviera officials say their 125000 square feet gives them the 
worlds largest casino despite statements in all the literature 
given to reporters by taj mahal officials that the taj mahal is the 
biggest 
ive always heard were the largest trump said its 
acknowledged to be the largest casino in the world 
the billionaire developer then cited the taj mahals 
grandeur and scope minimizing the flap over size you 
understand thats the least important part he said at some 
point perhaps this will be topped

manuel antonio noriegas defense put a former us 
attorney general on the witness stand monday and claimed the 
invasion of panama was bloodier and more destructive than the 
government has admitted 
the testimony which included videotapes of invasion violence 
and the arrest of the deposed panamanian leader was aimed at 
convincing us district judge william hoeveler that noriega should 
be freed to demonstrate that the governments executive branch is 
subject to the rule of law 
nothing general noriega is accused of is equivalent to what 
happened to the force that was used to bring him to the united 
states defense attorney jon may said we have to recognize 
that the methods we use sometimes make us worse than the people we 
are trying to arrest 
the prosecution avoided discussions of united states conduct 
during the dec 20 invasion with deputy solicitor general william 
bryson calling the issue legally irrelevant he said there was 
ample legal precedent showing the court could maintain jurisdiction 
over noriega whether or not the government violated his rights 
for the defense former us attorney general ramsey clark who 
served under presidents kennedy and johnson in the 1960s was put 
on the stand as a representative of an ad hoc group called the 
independent commission of inquiry on the us invasion of panama 
clark who toured panama in january is one of the most 
prominent members of the private group which also includes author 
graham greene 
clark was questioned about the number of civilian deaths in 
panama which the defense department has put at between 200 and 300 
i heard of estimates ranging as high as 7000 clark told 
the judge i still believe it will be at least a thousand and 
probably several thousand you never will know the absolute 
number 
but he refused to condemn the use of what the defense said were 
inhumane weapons used in attacks on civilians including cluster 
bombs and artillery 
on crossexamination by assistant us attorney michael 
sullivan clark acknowledged his stay in panama was brief and that 
much of his information was secondhand 
before clarks testimony defense attorney frank rubino 
presented videotape of invasion coverage from the major networks 
and panamanian television much of it aimed at showing the 
widespread destruction and homelessness caused by the invasion 
throughout the tape noriega sat impassively in his generals 
uniform at the defense table except for a twitch once when the 
film showed him in captivity aboard a usbound military transport 
plane 
key to the arguments is a 1974 case called united states vs 
toscanino in which a federal appellate court ruled that behavior 
shocking to the conscience during the arrest of a defendant 
even outside the united states could be grounds for freeing him 
the us attorneys office defended the invasion calling 
civilian deaths an unfortunate unavoidable byproduct of any 
military action in an urban area prosecutors also question the 
findings and integrity of the private investigatory commission 
prosecutors also point out that the us supreme court has never 
accepted the toscanino rule in fact they say the high court 
recently ruled in united states vs verdugourquidez that the 
fourth amendment protection against illegal search and seizure does 
not apply to noncitizens outside the country 
noriega faces 145 years in prison if convicted of a variety of 
drug counts in a february 1988 indictment that accused him of 
accepting bribes from colombias medellin drug cartel to turn 
panama into a way station for usbound cocaine the judge on 
monday again insisted that the trial will go ahead as scheduled on 
jan 28 1991

president bush saying the voice of freedom 
will not be stilled told broadcasters monday that the 
governments tv marti will keep transmitting into cuba despite 
concerns that fidel castro may widen his jamming of us radio 
stations 
he also told a national association of broadcasters convention 
that voice of america signals will still be beamed into eastern 
europe until change is complete 
there free stations and newspapers are still struggling to 
take root we need to be there now more than ever before to 
describe and explain our own two centuries of experience in 
building a democracy bush said 
he addressed the broadcasting organizations annual meeting as 
he began a twoday trip that will also take him to cincinnati 
indianapolis and detroit mostly to help raise funds for 
republican candidates 
bush waded into a sensitive area with broadcasters particularly 
in the southeast who are concerned about cuban retaliation against 
tv marti 
after testing of the television station began last tuesday 
castro jammed the signals of am radio stations in the region 
within cuba castro jammed tv martis signal with varying success 
look i do understand the practical concerns some of you have 
about this but i also understand that you represent the very 
principle tv marti exists to serve the free flow of ideas bush 
said 
so i have come here to ask something of you bush implored 
the broadcasters i ask you once again to stand for tv marti 
to stand for freedom 
the voice of freedom will not be stilled as long as there is 
an america to tell the truth bush told the audience to subdued 
applause 
broadcasters however were skeptical of the presidents appeal 
edward o fritts president of the broadcasters organization 
said its castros threat of jamming am stations that worries 
us 
he said that while us am radio stations are limited to 50000

the state department denounced on monday as 
inflammatory irresponsible and outrageous a threat by 
president saddam hussein of iraq to use chemical weapons against 
israel 
in a region already volatile enough nobody should be 
trumpeting chemical weapons spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler 
said they should be trumpeting their destruction 
however the state department has not officially determined the 
accuracy of the statement and is condemning it if reports of 
saddams warning are true ms tutwiler said 
the iraqi president in a speech broadcast by the state radio 
was quoted as categorically denying that his country had any atomic 
bombs but let them hear here and now that we do posses binary 
chemical weapons which only the united states and the soviet union 
also have he said 
saddam reportedly threatened to use them in retaliation if 
israel attacked and to destroy half the jewish state 
we have seen these reports and if they are true what we have 
seen is inflammatory irresponsible and outrageous ms tutwiler 
said reading from a prepared statement that she described as 
very strong 
a few minutes later the state department lashed out at israeli 
prime minister yitzhak shamir for an aides announcement on sunday 
indicating work would begin on five new jewish settlements on the 
west bank 
the creation of additional settlements are not conducive to 
the peace process and in fact we see them as an obstacle to 
peace ms tutwiler said again reading from a prepared 
settlement 
its disturbing that an israeli leadership which was unable to 
move forward on peace seems ready to move forward on new 
settlements the us official said 
the criticism was aimed directly at shamir whose likud coalition 
withheld approval of a formula by secretary of state james a baker 
iii for talks between israel and palestinian arabs 
the labor party had urged acceptance of the proposal the 
dispute tore apart the israeli government and bakers initiative is 
stalled 
two years ago the likudlabor partnership approved eight new 
settlements construction was begun on three while the five others 
were held up 
on sunday yossi ahimeir a spokesman for shamir said there 
were artificial delays until now and they will be removed 
but on monday avi pazner an adviser to the prime minister 
denied there had been a new decision to go ahead with the five 
settlements he said shamirs caretaker government which is 
temporarily in charge only continues the policy of the 
government of national unity and there are no plans to establish 
any new settlements 
on another development meanwhile the state department 
responded cautiously to reports that the palestine liberation 
organization had rebuilt its armed forces in lebanon to exceed the 
level in 1982 when israeli troops invaded the country and forced 
their departure 
we are aware that the number of armed groups including 
palestinians has increased in lebanon ms tutwiler said 
again careful not to single out the plo she said the presence 
of all these groups complicates lebanons problems and that all 
foreign forces should be withdrawn 
asked about a report that al fatah the mainstream plo group 
was conducting exercises to prepare for raids against israel ms 
tutwiler said i do not have a reaction to it she said she 
would check on the report 
in criticizing iraq the state department again condemned the 
proliferation of chemical weapons 
last week in a related action undersecretary of state richard 
mccormack registered concern with iraqi ambassador mohammed 
almashat that the arab country is trying to circumvent us 
restrictions on nuclear technology shipments 
we do not foresee a neartime iraqi nuclear capability 
spokesman richard boucher said on friday however we remain 
concerned about the danger 
mccormack also reiterated us opposition to the spread of 
missile technology in the middle east said a us official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
iraq in december launched a longrange threestage rocket that 
is believed capable of reaching israel 
last wednesday british customs officials of a shipment of 
usmade nuclear trigger components destined for iraq the fbi 
cooperated in the case

lithuanias president monday invited kremlin 
officials to lithuania to discuss the republics secession drive 
and struck a conciliatory note by saying lithuania wants gradual 
not immediate full independence 
while government officials sought a compromise solution to the 
dispute 1000 proindependence demonstrators rallied at the 
lithuanian prosecutors office to protest its occupation by soviet 
soldiers 
washington deplored moscow for ordering all 100 foreign 
journalists in the republic to leave by monday 
there was no immediate response from moscow to the invitation 
from president vytautas landsbergis of lithuania 
landsbergis told lithuanian legislators that officials face 
political difficulties in dealing with lithuanias march 11 
declaration of independence 
therefore it is essential to look for a way of helping them 
and ourselves he said in comments carried on lithuanian radio 
and monitored by the british broadcasting corp in london 
gorbachev faces independence movements in several of the soviet 
unions 15 republics lithuania and its baltic neighbors estonia 
and latvia were annexed after the soviets took control of them 
under the hitlerstalin pact of 1940 
the lithuanian declaration of independence may seem to some 
people a demand that power be handed over the very next day 
landsbergis said we did not expect this and did not count upon 
it 
instead landsbergis told legislators the republic had stated 
how by means of agreements and a gradual takeover of certain 
functions we would consolidate our independence 
gorbachev has said talks on independence can take place only if 
lithuania renounces its declaration of march 11 he has pressured 
the republic to do so by sending red army soldiers to take over 
public buildings in the lithuanian capital vilnius 
refusal to take back the declaration of independence may result 
in grave consequences for all of us gorbachev said in a 
statement to lithuanians on saturday 
in a telegram sent to gorbachev on monday morning landsbergis 
indicated that legislators would debate a full response and he 
invited a kremlin representative to take part in the discussion to 
explain moscows stand 
landsbergis also sent a delegation to moscow in the hopes of 
starting negotiations in the soviet capital 
spokesmen for the lithuanian supreme council said legislator 
egidius bickauskas had gone to moscow in hopes of meeting with 
soviet leaders and that three other people including deputy 
premier romualdas ozolas were following 
bickauskas has spent much of the past two weeks in moscow trying 
without success to begin talks 
about 1000 proindependence demonstrators rallied outside the 
lithuanian prosecutors office against the occupation of the 
building friday night by soviet soldiers 
both a prosecutor appointed by lithuanias breakaway government 
and one sent from moscow were working in the building monday 
employees said they reported a tense atmosphere but no direct 
conflicts between the two 
carla gruodis a legislative spokeswoman also said a member of 
the minority communist party that remained loyal to moscow had told 
editors of proindependence newspapers they could not have their 
newspapers published at the countrys main printing plant 
a handful of soldiers occupied that building early saturday 
ms gruodis said juozas kuolelis former head of state radio and 
television in lithuania called a meeting at the printing 
headquarters and told workers he had a decree from the national 
communist party central committee and the soviet council of 
ministers he said the decree gave the loyalist communist party the 
exclusive right to use the building 
ms gruodis said the plant manager and workers told kuolelis 
they were determined to continue printing proindependence 
newspapers despite the order 
papers owned by the lithuanian government that support the 
independence drive and publications of the proindependence 
sajudis political movement are printed at the plant 
the state department criticized moscows decision to expel 
western journalists from lithuania and called on moscow not to use 
intimidation coercion or military force to crush the baltic 
nations independence movement 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said secretary of state james a 
baker iii will raise the lithuanian subject during his meetings in 
washington later this week with soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze

the state department on monday deplored the 
soviet unions decision to expel western journalists from lithuania 
and called on moscow not to use intimidation coercion or military 
force to crush the baltic nations independence movement 
secretary of state james a baker iii will raise the lithuanian 
crisis during his meetings here later this week with soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze said department spokeswoman 
margaret tutwiler 
we have consistently advocated peaceful change ms tutwiler 
said as she repeated us support for lithuanias desire to 
achieve peaceful selfdetermination through negotiations with 
moscow 
it is not our place to prescribe the precise solution to the 
conflict ms tutwiler said 
she expressed the hope that every peaceful means will be 
explored to resolve the situation urging that nothing be done by 
either side to preclude a dialogue on lithuanias future 
the soviets have seized lithuanian government and communist 
party offices rolled armored vehicles through the streets of 
vilnius in a show of force and ordered all western journalists to 
leave the country by midnight sunday 
we regret the action that was taken yesterday ms tutwiler 
said referring to the soviet expulsion of reporters you all 
know how strongly we support freedom of the press 
but she declined to characterize or define what soviet actions 
would represent coercion intimidation or the use of force 
we have been on the record as saying that the use of force 
would be counterproductive and have an adverse impact on our 
relations she said 
it is important that the united states continue to call for 
the resolution of this issue through dialogue through negotiations 
in a peaceful manner so that ultimately the people of lithuania can 
indeed enjoy genuine independence 
as weve expressed in the past we are deeply concerned and we 
continue to be so she said

entire 600000 estate to make sure a pet pig and her dog are taken 
care of for the rest of their lives 
neighbors said margo lamp loved animals and was especially fond 
of her german shepherd named calamity jane cammy for short and 
a runt hog called mr pig the pig followed her around the yard on 
the porch and sometimes in the house 
there was certainly no question about the pig being a pet 
said george goebel attorney for ms lamps estate he would come 
up and rub against your pant leg and she fed him cat food 
about 100 less social pigs on the farm have been sold since her 
death six weeks ago 
ms lamp left bequests of 1000 each to friends in colorado and 
germany but left the rest to her animals

with the profits from her farm near davenport in eastern iowa and 
other assets the estate goes to the scott county humane society 
after the needs of the pets are met 
neighbors said ms lamp lived a solitary life but kept abreast 
of world events by subscribing to four newspapers and traveling to 
new york once a year to visit art museums 
she used to say she believed in solitude and that there was a 
difference between solitude and loneliness said a neighbor jack 
armstrong 
the farm was first run by ms lamps father hugo lamp it was 
one of the first in the area to have a combine 
ms lamp who never married lived alone on the 320acre farm 
she lost interest in the place when a hired man died in 1975 and 
allowed the buildings to become run down

us and japanese negotiators reached 
agreement on a oneyear pact to triple the number of observers on 
japanese driftnet boats and equip all the vessels with monitoring 
transmitters the state department said monday 
critics however said the pact would provide observers for only 
10 percent of japans driftnet vessels and allow the japanese to 
continue to fish the cold salmonrich waters south of the aleutian 
islands 
we still fall short of our goal of eliminating highseas drift 
nets but this is quite an improvement over last years 
agreement said sen ted stevens ralaska 
a spokesman for the state departments office of oceans 
environment and science tom snead said department negotiator ed 
wolfe had reached the agreement over the weekend in japan 
the pact calls for 98 vessels from japans squid and largemesh 
driftnet fleets to be monitored in the 1990 fishing season by 47 
us 41 japanese and 10 canadian observers last year 32 japanese 
driftnet vessels were covered by observers 
now we dont have to play hideandseek with the japanese 
rep john miller rwash said 
the us has made a step in the right direction but its not 
the final answer massive driftnetting efforts need to be 
eliminated drift nets take too many fish and kill too many marine 
mammals and sea birds he said 
the monitoring transmitters will send signals to satellites 
enabling the government to tell when the vessels enter waters where 
driftnetting is illegal critics of driftnetting say the

the man once considered the likely premier of 
east germanys first democracy stepped down as leader of the social 
democrats on monday amid allegations he had ties to the hated 
secret police 
ibrahim boehme became the second major political figure in east 
germany to quit because of reputed involvement with the security 
apparatus of the former stalinist regime 
thousands of people demonstrated in dresden and magdeburg on 
monday to protest the purported connections between new lawmakers 
and the former secret police and to demand a full investigation of 
parliament the government news service adn reported 
fifteen prominent east german social leaders and intellectuals 
including writer christa wolf issued a statement also demanding a 
probe 
boehme who twice lost jobs because he spoke out against the 
former communist government on friday inspected the files kept on 
him by the feared network known as the stasi he fainted and was 
hospitalized after seeing the files the party said 
boehme decided to resign after realizing that clearing his name 
will require lengthy investigations and make it more difficult 
to form east germanys first democratic government said august 
kamilli a highranking social democrat 
boehme 46 also cited health problems including heart troubles 
and an inner ear infection said markus meckel the partys deputy 
chairman and boehmes likely successor 
kamilli said boehme wrote a letter sunday telling of his plan to 
quit 
the party denied a television report that boehme tried to kill 
himself after reading the stasi files he was released from the 
hospital after an examination and was reported staying with 
friends he has not been seen in public since he waved to reporters 
after leaving stasi headquarters friday 
east germany has been thrown into a political crisis by charges 
that many of the newly elected members of the 400seat parliament 
had links to the stasi 
lothar de maiziere leader of the christian democratled 
coalition that won the most parliament seats march 18 has been 
accused of being a stasi informant he denied the allegations 
the charges have overshadowed efforts by de maizieres group to 
forge a governing coalition with the social democrats and clear the 
way for reunification with west germany 
meckel said the stasi network was so vast that only with 
international help can the country be free of the stasis 
influence he said a situation had developed where virtually 
everyone had come under suspicion 
last week boehme examined the voluminous dossiers of the stasi 
which are under control of a governmentappointed group working to 
disband the network 
boehmes attorney friedrichwilhelm von sell said no 
incriminating documents were found but that more documents need 
to be searched for and examined he did not elaborate 
just before the march 18 election politician wolfgang schnur 
admitted former ties to the secret police and resigned as head of 
democratic awakening part of the alliance that won the balloting 
the new parliament is to convene for the first time thursday 
but it is unlikely a governing coalition will be formed before 
then de maiziere is trying to build a voting bloc that would give 
him twothirds control in parliament 
de maiziere is likely to be east germanys new premier and is a 
close ally of west german chancellor helmut kohl 
manfred stolpe administrator of east berlins lutheran church 
last week examined secret police files kept on de maiziere and 
reported he saw nothing incriminating 
richard schroeder head of the social democrats parliamentary 
delegation recommended that every new lawmaker be required to fill 
out a questionnaire detailing their contact with the stasi 
the vast network of agents informants and people who simply 
gave information under intense pressure gave force to the regime of 
erich honecker who was ousted last year in east germanys peaceful 
prodemocracy revolt 
any activity deemed suspicious often resulted in the creation of 
a secret file with detailed documentation of even an individuals 
most innocuous activities the system created a sense of paranoia 
among the populace that still exists to a large extent 
as recently as a few months ago the boehmeled social democrats 
were considered heavy favorites to win the east german elections 
and boehme the likely premier 
but the christian democrats promising fast reunification as a 
quick path to western prosperity surged to a lopsided win 
the social democrats favor a more gradual approach to 
unification and emphasize environmental and social concerns 
boehme was a communist party member for 17 years but had 
numerous disagreements with the government in the 1960s and 1970s 
and was forced to resign from jobs as a school teacher and head of 
a local cultural society 
he quit the party in 1976 and became an active member of an 
illegal social democrat discussion group

negotiations and reschedule talks with south africas white 
minority government 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler noting that the 
anc canceled talks set for april 11 as a protest against police

mandela had planned with followers of chief mangosuthu gatsha 
buthelezi in violenceplagued natal province also has been 
postponed at the urging of anc activists 
mr mandela will visit the area of the fighting in natal today 
and tomorrow and we have heard there is a possibility that he 
might meet privately with chief buthelezi during that time she 
said 
the april 11 meeting would have been an important next step on 
the road to negotiations she said the joint rally would have 
allowed the two chief elements of the opposition in natal to begin 
working together to end the violence there 
we encourage the anc to reaffirm its commitment to peace and 
negotiations and the best way to end the violence is through 
dialogue

percent last year the largest decline in six years the 
agriculture department said monday 
overall american smokers consumed about 533 billion cigarettes 
in 1989 the departments economic research service said in a 
report exports however jumped 20 percent to 142 billion 
cigarettes 
annual use by the us adult population dropped 7 percent to 
2888 cigarettes the report said economist verner grise said that 
was the lowest average since 1942 when the average was 2585 
cigarettes per adult 
the peak was 4345 cigarettes in 1963 before beginning its 
longtime decline 
the average is for all americans 18 years and older smokers and 
nonsmokers alike it is a statistical comparsison only and does 
not indicate the actual smoking habits of the population 
domestic cigarette consumption will probably continue to fall 
this year because of higher prices increased restrictions on where 
people can smoke antismoking activity and declining social 
acceptance of smoking the report said

a leftist group monday said it was 
fighting imperialism in central america when it ambushed a bus 
carrying 28 us servicemen and wounded eight of them 
the honduran military chief gen arnulfo cantero lopez has 
said a nationwide manhunt is under way for the snipers who opened 
fire saturday with machine guns on a bus carrying 28 us airmen 
back from a trip to the beach two of the eight were in critical 
condition with head and body wounds 
the morazano national liberation front has claimed 
responsibility for the daylight attack outside tegucigalpa and the 
us embassy said that claim is given credence 
in the fronts statement published monday in the daily newspaper 
el tiempo it declared we condemn with all our revolutionary 
force the central american occupation by the yankee empire which 
has shed the blood of our people from panama to guatemala 
with this action taken by patriotic morazan commandos against 
the occupying troops we remind our people and the people of the 
world that we continue to fight against everyone who despoils our 
fatherland 
the fight against imperialism in central america has more 
validity today than in the past 
the front is thought to be an arm of the communist party founded 
in 1979 but us officials say little else is known about the 
group 
its a small radical group that has shown itself prone to 
carry out terrorist atacks on us military in honduras embassy 
spokesman terrence kneebone said 
the united states keeps about 1200 troops in honduras on a 
yearround basis mostly at soto cano air base in central honduras 
additional soldiers are frequently brought in for joint exercises 
with the honduran military 
a witness to saturdays attack near tegucigalpa said there were 
three snipers on a ridge about 50 feet up kneebone said a handful 
of 45 caliber slugs found at the scene indicates the snipers used 
a thompson submachine gun and a world war iiera m3 grease gun 
both usmade weapons he said 
the front also claimed responsibility for the last major attack 
on us forces in honduras on july 13 that bombing injured seven 
us military policemen in la ceiba 200 miles north of tegucigalpa 
the front has claimed several other attacks in past years

president bush may shift funds to military 
personnel accounts only if the money comes from star wars the b2 
bomber and other programs the chairman of the house armed services 
committee said monday 
rep les aspin dwis who had blocked bushs attempts to 
transfer the money to avoid massive layoffs said he was not 
opposed to some relief for our men and women in uniform 
however he added conditions for providing that relief 
including explicit assurances from the bush administration that 
the incident will not happen again and the requirement that the 
source of the money will be several bigticket weapons systems 
it must be clearly established that military people are a 
higher priority than hardware aspin said in a threepage letter 
to defense secretary dick cheney 
he said the money must come from four of the favored weapons 
programs the strategic defense initiative popularly known as 
star wars the b2 bomber ssn21 attack submarine and the armys 
light helicopter program 
aspin and several other members of congress are scheduled to 
meet tuesday with cheney on the issue 
the controversy centers on the administrations request to 
congress earlier this year for the authority to transfer the funds 
from several pentagon accounts to military personnel 
bush had the option in august to exclude personnel from the 
budgetcutting law but decided against it pentagon officials 
testified recently that they did not ask for the exemption on the 
assumption that congress would later give them the authority to 
transfer the money 
but four congressional committees are required to approve such a 
shift in defense funds and aspin declined to bring the issue up in 
his committee 
i objected to your fiscal year 1990 reprogramming requests for 
personnel because they represented an attempt to ease the pain of 
grammrudman on the pentagon but nowhere else aspin said in 
the letter that was and is unacceptable 
since aspins action money from the pentagon accounts that 
would have served as the source for the transfer have been 
earmarked for an aid package for nicaragua and panama 
but cheney is still pressing for the funds to avoid laying off 
thousands of military men and women aspin proposes that the major 
strategic weapons the administration has favored serve as the 
source 
cuts from these programs would restore the grammrudman bite 
just where the administrations budget strategy sought to avoid 
it aspin said taking money out of these four programs will 
hurt but that was the point in the first place 
aspin also said the assurances that such an action will not 
happen again must be made by both cheney and white house budget 
chief richard darman in public testimony before the house armed 
services committee

ive all along said that i didnt think that was a good way to 
use funds frenzel said i dont object to members taking some 
modest amounts but that isnt why those moneys were 
solicited 
critics say the perk has allowed house members with safe seats 
to amass huge unneeded campaign money they could put to personal 
use when they retired 
frenzel who had 358347 in the bank jan 1 is one of 186 
house members eligible to keep their campaign funds and one of 69 
holding at least 250000 according to a survey by roll call a 
semiweekly capitol hill newspaper 
frenzel who announced his retirement friday said hell return 
all the contributions he received for this years election 
including the 53366 he reported collecting in 1989 and everything 
he has received this year 
much of the remaining money will be given to other candidates 
he said last year his campaign gave 1000 each to six house or 
senate candidates 
frenzels campaign committee will decide how to dispose of the 
rest of the money he said 
if they want to buy me a goodbye dinner im not going to 
complain about that frenzel said im not running for mexico 
with a big wad of my campaign money

a man who donated one of his kidneys to save his 
mothers life seven years ago died hours before she could repay him 
with a bone marrow transplant to help him overcome leukemia 
authorities said monday 
im really heartbroken ernestine mitchell said if only 
he could have lasted eight more hours 
her 37yearold son hilliary had been unable to work as a 
truck driver since contracting leukemia and was to receive the 
bone marrow transplant during a daylong operation beginning at 
730 am he died of an infection shortly before midnight sunday 
said john easton spokesman for the university of chicago hospitals 
mitchell died from an overwhelming infection related to the 
leukemia and the loss of his immune system easton said high 
doses of chemotherapy needed to combat the disease and prepare the 
patient for the transplant can leave the patient without a 
functioning immune system 
mrs mitchell said she and other family members were at her 
sons bedside sunday and had expected him to hang on for the 
potentially lifesaving procedure 
its a hurting thing but i have to remain strong because he 
was strong at the end mrs mitchell said he talked to us and 
was kissing us all and we thought he was getting better we were 
waiting for 730 to come 
mrs mitchell said she was convinced her bone marrow would have 
helped 
i carried him for nine months his body was a part of my body 
then he gave me his kidney she said i know that if he had 
gotten the marrow everything would have been ok being a mother i 
think it would have 
mitchell himself knew that his odds were not good because his 
disease was already at an advanced stage and he had been 
hospitalized before because of other infections easton said 
leukemia is a form of cancer in which abnormal cells can spread 
in the bone marrow preventing it from making normal blood cells 
this leaves the patient highly susceptible to serious infections 
anemia and bleeding a transplant replaces the patients defective 
marrow with healthy marrow 
easton said the mothers bone marrow removal operation had been 
scheduled for this morning with the transplant to be done in the 
afternoon the operation was filled with risks and the odds of 
mitchells recovery were 25 percent to 40 percent he said 
mitchell had been mentally prepared said dr robert geller who 
was to have performed the transplant when youve got no options 
you go with what youve got geller said 
mitchell already had won one battle in getting the money for the 
150000 transplant from the state medicaid program after gov 
james r thompson stepped in and reversed a decision denying funds 
for the operation 
getting the money was the hard part mitchell said as he 
entered the hospital march 23 im a survivor ive walked in 
here and im going to walk out again well 
geller a bone cancer specialist said mitchell had been under 
intensive chemotherapy for the past 10 days those drugs and the 
antirejection drugs mitchell would have received are highly toxic 
and the kidney is the most important organ in handling that 
toxicity 
he said mitchells leukemia was in an aggressive phase and that 
his mother was not an ideal donor perfect bone marrow tissue comes 
from a brother or sister with an identical tissue match geller 
said 
but geller said tissue match between mother and son had been 
good enough in the kidney operation mrs mitchell had been dying 
of polycystic kidney disease 
her sons act in donating his kidney is more dear to me now 
than ever mrs mitchell said i have an everlasting part of 
him my perpetual mothers day gift

lowincome residents of federally subsidized 
housing may accept temporary jobs as 1990 census takers without 
facing possible rent increases because of the additional income 
the government said monday 
jack kemp secretary of the department of housing and urban 
development said he signed the waiver because it will help 
residents of rent subsidized housing earn extra income and will 
also help the census bureau secure a more accurate account of the 
number of lowincome rentsubsidized americans 
the census bureau hires the temporary workers to canvass homes 
in which residents did not return the 1990 census form received in 
the mail the temporary jobs pay up to 8 an hour 
hud and census bureau officials said hiring residents of 
subsidized housing complexes to canvass their neighbors should help 
provide a more accurate count the formulas for several hud grant 
programs are based on census information 
lowincome residents who receive rent subsidies generally pay a 
percentage of their income for rent the waiver signed by kemp 
would exempt any income from the census bureau temporary jobs from 
the rent calculation

the communist party will change its name 
on tuesday and that of its newspaper informed sources said the 
change will coincide with the beginning of a more realistic dollar 
exchange rate 
the state news agency bta said bulgarians traveling abroad will 
have to pay up to four times as much for us dollars or other 
convertible currencies but no other details were given 
vladimir vladimirov director general of the national bank 
announced that the new rate for one dollar will be 960 leva for 
those seeking to buy dollars those wishing to sell dollars to the 
government can do so at a rate of 969 
but bta later said the new rate would be a floating exchange 
rate governed by supply and demand 
the agency also reported that while final results of a 
membership referendum were not available most favor the communist 
party being renamed the bulgarian socialist party 
sources speaking to the ap on condition of anonymity said a 
decision to that effect is to be announced after a session tuesday 
of the partys supreme council successor to the longtime 
policysetting central committee the sources also said the party 
newspaper would be renamed but did not elaborate 
last week however a small independent party challenged the 
forthcoming decision saying it already had the same name the 
socialist party 
a crane meanwhile lifted the huge rabotnichekso delo workers 
affairs sign off the roof of the communist party newspaper 
building in sofia on monday 
the newspaper with a daily circulation of 800000 from now on 
will be published under the name duma word bta said 
bta said the national bank on monday cut by more than half the 
amount of freely convertible currency that can be purchased by 
bulgarians traveling abroad they are now entitled to buy 30 worth 
instead of 65 
the previous dollar exchange rate was about 250 long 
considered unrealistic informants said the new rate was designed 
to curb a growing black market 
the measure will make it even harder for bulgarians to visit 
western countries however

authorities on monday mobilized 100 policemen to 
track down suspects in a weekend antitax rally that erupted into a 
riot and one of the worst outbreaks of violence in modernday 
london 
the courts took a hard line with some of the 339 people already 
arrested at least 12 taken into custody during saturdays sixhour 
melee at trafalgar square were refused bail at five london courts 
most of the 68 people in court monday were in their teens or 20s 
and gave addresses in london squats illegal residences in 
abandoned houses or apartments the charges ranged from arson to 
criminal damage and theft to threatening behavior 
scotland yard police headquarters said the riot over the 
imposition of a new tax by the thatcher government on every adult 
caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage and injured 374 
of the 2198 police officers involved police said 86 civilians 
were injured 
charges of blame for the violence meanwhile flew back and forth 
authorities accused anarchists who in turn blamed police the 
government partly blamed the opposition labor party and a labor 
member accused the government of playing politics 
home secretary david waddington said 100 policemen were taking 
part in a largescale search for suspects headed by chief det roy 
ramm 
the detective appealed to the news media and public to provide 
film and photographs of the riot to help police identify 
troublemakers 
magistrates set bail for some suspects charged with public order 
offenses however as a condition of bail some were forbidden to 
attend any more antitax demonstrations while others were barred 
from coming within one mile of trafalgar square 
the violence broke out after a peaceful demonstration by about 
40000 people police were attacked automobiles burned and 
overturned shop windows smashed and shops looted 
the demonstrators were protesting a new tax called the community 
charge which is levied on every adult to finance local government 
services across the country the old tax was levied on property 
owners 
many households will be paying up to onethird more while 
millions of people will be paying the tax for the first time 
demonstrations against the tax have broken out across britain 
and the levy has been blamed for contributing to drop in popularity 
for prime minister margaret thatchers conservatives 
the yard said anarchists in a group called class war were 
prominent in starting trouble 
however andy murphy a leader of the group said the police 
were attacked and quite rightly so in comments to bbc radio she 
called the rioters who battled police workingclass heroes 
the demonstration organizers the all britain antipoll tax 
federation blamed a small group of troublemakers but also accused 
police of losing control 
in a noisy house of commons debate waddington denied the 
demonstration had not been sufficiently policed 
what happened on this occasion was that it was not just a few 
but 3000 or so members of our society behaved in a most 
disgraceful criminal and uncivilized fashion said waddington 
the cabinet minister for law and order 
the police showed courage and restraint in dealing with some 
of the most ferocious violence we have ever seen on the streets of 
london he said 
both opposition and conservative government politicians 
condemned the violence however waddington said part of the blame 
had to be shouldered by the opposition labor party because 30 of 
its members had urged citizens not to pay the poll tax 
do they really expect the people they seek to influence to 
stop just trying to break the tax and not in fact encourage them 
to break policemens heads waddington said 
labor party lawmaker peter mandelson called waddingtons attack 
mindless mudslinging he said the minister was trying to score 
political points

ethiopian officials met with four of 
the five major eritrean rebel groups on monday for peace talks 
aimed at ending africas longest civil war 
while the main guerrilla faction did not attend the meeting in 
this north yemenese capital officials hope the talks will develop 
into an overall peace conference involving all factions 
at the opening meeting sunday night at the north yemen foreign 
ministry in sana both sides stressed their desire to end the 
guerrilla war with a lasting political settlement they then went 
into closed session 
shewandani yalta a member of the politburo of ethiopias ruling 
labor party led a 14member delegation to the talks sponsored by 
north yemen a country facing ethiopian on the other side of the 
red sea 
in attendance were rebel leaders from the eritrean liberation 
front the elfrevolutionary council the elfnational council and 
the elfunified organization 
the moslemdominated groups claim to represent half the 
disparate rebel forces fighting for autonomy for ethiopias 
northern province since 1962 
former president jimmy carter arranged talks between the leading 
eritrean popular liberation front and ethiopian authorities in 
atlanta last year and then this year in nairobi kenya 
the front which was not attending the talks in north yemen 
launched a new offensive in february and recently captured the port 
of mussawa 
no one at the new talks has pointed to any basis for an 
agreement although there is a un resolution calling for eritrean 
selfrule 
an eritrean source speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the main thing is to decide whether to continue negotiations or 
not and then possible solutions will be laid out 
the sana meeting is the second between the four smaller 
eritrean groups and the ethiopians the first mediated by the east 
african neighbor sudan was held in khartoum in march and april

republican party chairman lee atwater entered 
a new york hospital monday for intense radiation treatment of a 
type of brain tumor that experts say is persistent and dangerous 
mary matalin chief of staff for the republican national 
committee said in a statement that doctors had determined atwater 
has an astrocytoma a type of tumor that has the potential to 
behave aggressively 
the tumor was diagnosed last month after atwater collapsed 
during a speech 
dr stuart grossman director of neurological onocology at the 
johns hopkins oncology center in baltimore said astrocytomas are 
tough tumors to cure they do have a tendency to come back 
astrocytomas are graded i through iv although grade iv is 
usually called by another name the announcement did not identify 
the grade of atwaters tumor 
all of these types of tumors are potentially curable and 
potentially fatal said dr r william harter an associate 
professor of radiation onocology at georgetown unversity hospital 
he said for a grade i astrocytoma the fiveyear survival rate is 
about 50 percent when treated aggressively for grade ii he said 
the fiveyear survival rate is 25 percent and for grade iii it is 
10 percent to 20 percent 
grade iv more commonly called glioblastoma multiforme or 
anaplastic astrocytoma are always fatal harter said 
grossman cautioned that a five year survival does not equal 
cure 
these types of tumors usually come back he said 
another physician who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
patients with astrocytomas run a substantial risk of dying from 
this disease at some point 
one source familiar with the case said doctors found cells 
within the tumor that had the potential for sudden growth the 
source who also spoke on condition of anonymity said there had 
been no growth in the tumor diagnosed march 6 
atwater 39 checked into new york citys montefiore medical 
center where doctors planned to insert radioactive isotopes into 
the tumor on the right side of his brain after the procedure done 
under local anesthesia the isotopes remain implanted for five days 
the treatment is under the direction of dr paul l kornblith 
chairman of neurological surgery at the albert einstein college of 
medicine 
mr atwaters age and excellent physical condition together 
with the early diagnosis of the tumor its size and location offer 
favorable circumstances for successful results kornblith said 
the treatment provides a higher dose of radiation targeted on 
the tumor over a shorter time period matalin said 
the rnc announcement said atwaters tumor is in the frontal 
lobe both harter and grossman said the frontal lobe is more easily 
treated without the risk of loss of function than are most other 
areas of the brain 
harter said patients receiving radioactive isotope treatment 
directly on brain tumors seldom suffer acute side effects and most 
are able to work while the treatment is under way 
every two to three months after receiving such therapy patients 
are reexamined with xray or magnetic images taken to determine 
if the tumor is growing 
you can have a problem on down the line in that the area 
exposed to the radiation may shrivel up grossman said the 
brain doesnt handle such dead tissue very well so you have to go 
in and clear it of dead cells 
in cincinnati president bush said he wished atwater his best 
right now theres nothing more important for lee to do than 
get well and i know thats exactly what he intends to do given 
that fighting spirit bush said while campaigning for george 
voinovich the gop gubernatorial candidate in ohio 
after atwater was first hospitalized doctors said the tumor was 
nonmalignant and would be treated with daily radiation therapy 
over a fiveweek period 
the doctors are sticking by the original thing that its 
small and its very treatable said charles black a political 
consultant who is a close friend and former business partner of 
atwater 
what he did was seek out the most aggressive kind of radiation 
treatment you can get black said what these guys are going to 
do is in a week give him more radiation than he would get over the 
whole five weeks with the program he was on

soggy commuters walked bicycled and joined 
in carpools to get to work monday and half of buffalos high school 
students were absent from classes because of the citys bus and 
subway system shutdown 
i just dont understand this at all said sheila addison 
who walked three miles through drizzle and fog to her job at a 
downtown bank 
a chance at reviving some transit service in time for monday 
evenings rush hour fell through when commissioners of the niagara 
frontier transportation authority balked at a financial rescue plan 
that would have eliminated all weekend service and 125 of the 
systems 600 bus drivers 
the commissioners agreed to delay taking a formal vote on the 
plan after erie county executive dennis gorski told them aides to 
gov mario cuomo were willing to consider contributing additional 
state money 
a cuomo spokeswoman later said she knew nothing about that 
possibility and the commissioners went home after deciding no 
immediate help would be forthcoming from the state 
bus and subway service for 120000 daily riders ended early 
sunday when the transit agency ran out of cash the shutdown of a 
sixmile subway line and 1015 miles of bus routes came three days 
after the county legislature rejected a proposed tax on utilities 
to raise 9 million for transit 
the system costs 55 million a year to run and depends on a 
combination of farebox revenues and grants from the county state 
and federal governments it barely avoided a deficit in the fiscal 
year that ended friday and faced a 156 million gap in the new 
fiscal year budget 
the shutdown left 11000 public high school students without a 
ride to school attendance was as low as 40 percent at some high 
schools said school spokeswoman kathy shriver she said no 
decision had been made about whether to penalize students for their 
absences 
buffalo teachers federation president philip rumore said the 
union would wait for the transit agency to vote on the bailout plan 
before asking a federal judge to order service to be restored the 
union says the shutdown has illegally disrupted the citys 
desegregation plan 
public and private schools in new yorks secondlargest city 
remained open and buffalos 25000 elementary students rode 
privately contracted buses as usual 
commuters fared better than the students but nearly everyone 
had a story to tell 
my sisterinlaw has this old junky piece of car and said we 
could use it if we could find out whats wrong with it said 
tequita craig a nurses aide we dished out 70 for a new 
battery 
police capt john okeefe said traffic density was near normal 
but a lot of motorists appeared to have joined carpools 
where youd usually have one guy in a car or two guys today 
there were six guys okeefe said 
others braved the chilly damp weather to get to their jobs 
everybody was walking together with sneakers on can you 
believe it said a woman named tennizee high who walked 1 hours 
to her downtown job 
county and transit officials met all night to devise a new 
fiscal plan for the transit system 
county officials agreed to raise real estate transfer taxes and 
starting next year to allocate a portion of sales tax revenue to 
transit the transit agency agreed to raise fares from 1 to 110 
raise transfers from 5 cents to 20 cents and make 25 million in 
budget cuts 
the deal collapsed when transit officials rechecking their 
figures discovered they had been using the wrong fiscal year in 
their calculations and that 37 million in budget cuts would be 
necessary

nelson mandela stood on a muddy 
hilltop monday in natal provinces valley of death and pleaded 
for peace while members of warring zulu factions glared at each 
other from opposite ridges 
this violence must end said mandela vice president of the 
antiapartheid african national congress he was speaking to about 
200 anc supporters in imbali a township where rival blacks have 
battled since 1983 
the main combatants are anc supporters and backers of the 
inkatha party which is headed by zulu homeland leader mangosuthu 
buthelezi 
since heavy fighting began in 1986 more than 4000 blacks have 
died in southeastern natal province the battles have intensified 
the past week with at least 53 injured hundreds injured and 
thousands made homeless 
when the sun sets after soaking autumn rains on the grassy hills 
of edendale valley the night brings the sound of gunshots screams 
and the explosion of gasoline bombs 
the sun rises through the morning mists to reveal bodies lying 
in the streets and fields houses aflame and women and children 
hurrying along the roads carrying their hastily wrapped belongings 
mandela went to the heart of what has been dubbed the valley 
of death with two messages that he and other anc leaders cared 
what was happening and that the enemy is not fellow zulus 
we are not fighting inkatha we are fighting apartheid and the 
forces of oppression he told a crowd of 2000 earlier in the day 
in edendale they shoved into a church hall to hear him then 
stampeded out to chase and cheer his car along the wet dirt road 
later he repeated the message in nearby imbali where local 
residents said four men died the night before in fighting 
hundreds of anc supporters lined the ridges of the hills around 
the township to glimpse mandelas motorcade on the opposite hill 
they said they were afraid to pass through the section of town 
controlled by the rival inkatha group to hear mandelas speech as 
he talked to the few hundred who tramped across muddy fields to see 
him the crowd stirred mumbled and pointed to inkatha men on an 
opposite hill 
mandela repeated his desire to meet with buthelezi an old 
friend despite their political differences he had suggested 
holding a joint peace rally monday with the inkatha leader but 
natal anc leaders and other antiapartheid figures persuaded him to 
cancel friday 
their view seemed to predominate in the noninkatha sections of 
imbali where young men in the streets said a mandelabuthelezi 
meeting would change nothing and a joint peace rally would be 
dangerous 
i think he thought it would stop the war 20yearold 
sibusiso peters said of mandelas desire for a peace meeting but 
i think we know better

a conservative leader monday accused 
former premier andreas papandreou of backing organized violence in 
the campaign for april 8 elections 
constantine mitsotakis leader of the new democracy party made 
the accusation the day after shots from a passing car killed a 
socialist supporter and injured four people in iraklion on the 
island of crete mitsotakis party says one of the injured was a 
new democracy backer 
andreas papandreou and his supporters are trying with all 
legitimate and illegitimate means even violence to block the 
rise of new democracy to power mitsotakis told a news conference 
yesterdays violence on crete was part of a carefully worked 
out plan said mitsotakis 
papandreou leader of the panhellenic socialist movement 
described mitsotakis statements as inflammatory and morally 
unacceptable in televized remarks from his home 
sundays violence broke out after socialist supporters set up 
barricades to stop conservatives from approaching iraklions 
center where mitsotakis was scheduled to address a campaign rally 
papandreou said the dead man and one of the four wounded were 
party members 
new democracy said crete journalist costas papageorgiou 40 
shot in the chest and listed in serious condition is a party 
cadre papageorgiou works for the newspaper kastrina nea of 
iraklion 
mitsotakis said that at his request premier xenophon zolotas 
had earlier asked papandreou to order his supporters to dismantle 
the roadblocks but the socialist leader refused 
papandreou did nothing because he wanted acrimony and he 
wanted to provoke the incidents mitsotakis said 
this is not the first time new democracy is the victim of 
terrorist acts they are trying to intimidate us terrorize us and 
even murder us he said 
mitsotakis soninlaw conservative member of parliament pavlos 
bakoyannis was shot to death by the november 17 urban terrorist 
group in september 
mitsotakis himself was the target of an attack before national 
elections in november a greek air force warrant officer was killed 
as he attempted to plant a time bomb in a theater on the island of 
lesbos where mitsotakis was due to speak later the same day 
greeks have already voted in two inconclusive elections since 
june

the commerce department moved on monday to 
free exports of harddisk drives for personal computers 
last year us sales to other countries were worth about 500 
million the department said despite licensing requirements 
imposed to keep them out of the soviet union and its allies 
dropping the curbs is expected to lead to a large increase in sales 
on wednesday the licensing restrictions will be removed for 
sales of disks with a capacity of 45 megabytes to almost all 
countries outside the soviet union and its allies one megabyte 
holds roughly a million characters 
the net result of this decontrol will be to focus and maintain 
export restrictions on those items that are truly strategic and can 
be controlled effectively said dennis e kloske undersecretary 
of commerce for export control in a statement 
the department has decided the harddisk drives can be bought 
freely from other countries so there is no reason to prevent 
american companies from competing for the business 
for sales to the soviets and its east european allies the 
commerce department is submitting a proposal to the coordinating 
committee on multilateral export controls cocom in paris this 
group includes the member countries of nato except for iceland 
plus japan and australia 
until cocom rules the commerce department will continue to 
require export licenses for shipments to eastern europe countries 
it said 
if cocom agrees as it is expected to do within a few months 
us disk drives will be available for sale anywhere in the world 
except to libya cuba vietnam north korea cambodia and the 
police and armed forces of south africa 
last friday the defense department announced that it had decided 
to drop out of export licensing for what it called minimal 
security risk items and leave decisions on those to the commerce 
department 
these items included some computers medical equipment and 
industrial items including machine tools and telecommunications 
equipment pentagon officials will continue to look at requests to 
export supercomputers 
business people have complained for years that review by the two 
departments cause export delays and complications

pittsburgh braced for a longterm water crisis 
monday as a slowmoving fuel spill snaked down the allegheny river 
threatening supplies to as many as 1 million people 
i think its very possible the worst of this is yet to come 
said the citys public safety director glenn cannon theres no 
end to it 
a hospital served meals on paper plates supermarkets sold out 
of bottled water schools closed and a steel plant trucked in water 
to flush its toilets 
a landslide late friday severed an underground 10inchwide 
pipeline near freeport 35 miles north of pittsburgh the pipe 
spilled between 75000 and 300000 gallons of gasoline diesel fuel 
and kerosene into the river 
like tumbling dominoes water companies along the allegheny were 
forced to close the intakes of their water treatment plants one by 
one as the 20milelong spill oozed toward pittsburgh reaching the 
city early monday evening some were able to reopen monday as the 
spill became more diluted and the water could be treated with 
filters 
the pittsburgh water department which serves 450000 people 
still was drawing water from the river and boosting its reservoirs 
monday afternoon but was preparing to close its intakes at any 
moment 
if the spill should move suddenly well have to shut the 
plant said mayor sophie masloff 
pittsburgh gets only part of its water from the allegheny and 
had enough reserves to last three to five days said cannon the 
longterm impact could be devastating he said 
up to 20000 residents served by the harrison township water 
authority have been without water since saturday and depended on 
national guard portable water tanks set up to provide drinking and 
cooking water 
orders to conserve water were issued to at least 400000 other 
people served by various other water authorities northeast of 
pittsburgh 
at least nine school districts closed monday idling more than 
21000 students and many businesses were affected by the spill 
state emergency officials trucked in water to replenish a 
45000gallon reservoir at allegheny valley hospital which draws 
its water from the river the hospital used paper plates and cups 
to serve meals to its 225 patients closed its laundry and was 
sending dirty linens to another hospital 
drinking water was trucked in for the 2600 employees of the 
allegheny ludlum steel corp specialty steel plant in nearby 
brackenridge and some was used to flush toilets said company 
spokesman bert delano 
at marshalls amoco station in natrona heights about 30 miles 
northeast of pittsburgh the taps and the car wash went dry sunday 
afternoon said attendant laurie maycock 
nothing happens when you turn the tap on she said but 
its not so bad its raining so no one wants to wash their car 
anyway 
like many supermarkets in the area the shopn save in natrona 
heights quickly sold out of 150 cases of bottled water monday 
morning 
thats the thing about water said manager bill rossey 
you dont miss it until its gone 
the thick gellike spill estimated to be 5 to 21 feet deep 
moved almost imperceptibly at times at its fastest it moved half 
a mile an hour 
its almost as if it stops and takes a rest somewhere said 
john kaus of the allegheny county emergency management agency 
booms stretched across the river were having little effect and 
recovered less than 10000 gallons because most of the fuel was 
well below the surface kaus said 
about 100 workers from buckeye pipeline co and two contractors 
worked monday to clean up the leak said roy haase jr of buckeye 
pipeline below the source of the leak crews built a dam on knapp 
run creek to collect fuel flowing from the oilsoaked soil 
the landslide prevented workers from reaching the broken 
pipeline but the danger of an explosion has been minimized by rain 
and wind haase said 
officials said some fish and other aquatic life were killed but 
said it was too early to determine the extent of environmental 
damage

president bush needs a strategy to help new 
democracies around the world before expecting congress to approve 
the 800 million he seeks for panama and nicaragua senate majority 
leader george mitchell said monday 
the administration is asking congress to put together a jigsaw 
puzzle without any overall picture and without all the pieces 
mitchell dmaine said in a statement that called the white house 
approach piecemeal 
the majority leaders comments appeared to place a further 
complication in the way of quick passage of the aid money which 
bush contends is necessary to bolster the new democratic 
governments in the two central american countries 
house passage of the aid measure which has ballooned to 24 
billion with the addition by lawmakers of an array of domestic 
spending was expected to come on tuesday with a minimum of 
controversy 
but no action had been scheduled in the senate on the money 
bill which bush had said he wanted to be enacted before congress 
leaves town thursday for a 12day easter recess 
mitchell said he hoped to begin work in the senate wednesday on 
a companion bill setting up aid programs for the two countries but 
that bill contains no money to fund the programs 
by approaching foreign aid on a countrybycountry basis and 
in oneshot increments the administration has provided no overall 
or longterm view of how all the pieces can and should fit 
together mitchell said 
they have provided no rationale as to how this request relates 
to other parts of the budget to other foreign aid spending to 
defense or domestic spending to the deficit he said 
mitchell contended that the administration has provided no plan 
for future aid to the two central american countries or how their 
priority for aid compares to that of emerging democracies in 
eastern europe and elsewhere 
administration officials testifying before congress have said 
the money is needed as a speedy response to conditions that could 
not have been foreseen when the white house wrote its budget for 
this year it has proposed to pay for the aid through commensurate 
cuts in the pentagon budget 
mitchell said he would not delay in meeting the genuine 
emergency needs for panama and nicaragua but he added i do 
not believe we should appropriate the full amount requested until 
the administration submits a meaningful longterm foreign aid 
plan 
in the first spurt of us aid to emerging democracies it was 
mitchell and senate democrats who led the way last year in 
providing millions for poland and hungary mitchell called bush 
timid for not doing more for emerging democracies 
mitchells statement on monday said it makes little sense for 
the congress to lurch from country to country on piecemeal 
emergency foreign aid requests for different parts of the world 
without some kind of an overall longterm plan that relates aid 
to the rest of the budget 
in a brief interview mitchell said the statement was not 
inconsistent with last years action but was a response to the 
sheer number of these oneshot requests when they accumulate in 
number the need for an overall plan becomes apparent 
mitchell further spelled out his request in a letter to 
secretary of state james a baker iii saying the spending plan 
should cover plans for the next three to five years for foreign 
aid defense spending domestic spending and the deficit 
the administration has not explained the relationship between 
this request and our overall national security objectives 
mitchell told baker 
i believe it is essential that the senate have such a plan 
before it appropriates the emergency aid requested by the 
administration for panama and nicaragua

traces of a fungicide not approved in the 
united states have been found in 11 samples of imported wines the 
food and drug administration said monday 
there is no ban on the wines and none is being recalled said 
fda spokesman bill grigg but the fda is requiring the makers of 
these wines to certify that they do not contain the fungicide 
procymidone before they are shipped to this country 
grigg said the vineyards involved must retain independent 
testing labs to certify that the wines are fungicidefree before 
shipping them to the united states he said the fda will conduct 
spot tests on the wines to confirm the certifications 
the maker of procymidone sumitomo chemical co of osaka japan 
has begun providing the environmental protection agency with data 
on the fungicide which is approved in europe the fda said 
this could lead to the setting of a residue tolerance by epa 
currently the epa has no tolerance levels for procymidone which 
means that no amount of it can appear in any products sold here 
grigg said 
he also said there is no indication the fungicide which is 
applied to grapes while they are growing constitutes a health risk 
the fda initiated a 200sample survey after traces of 
procymidone were found in an italian sparkling wine tosti asti 
spumante 
of the 116 wine samples tested so far seven french and three 
italian wines were found to contain traces of the fungicide 
no traces were found in samples of wines from australia brazil 
chile germany hungary israel spain and portugal the fda said 
the agency so far is requiring testing of tosti asti spumante 
as well as two other wines in which traces of the fungicide were 
found gionelli asti spumante and bampg saintlouis beaujolais 
residues of the fungicide also were found in the following wines 
asti spumante collinetta

iraqi president saddam hussein said for the 
first time monday that his country has deadly binary nerve gas 
weapons and he threatened to use them on israel if the jewish 
state attacks iraq 
binary weapons usually artillery shells or missile warheads 
contain two relatively safe compounds that combine to produce toxic 
nerve gases the first use of chemical weapons was outlawed under 
the 1925 geneva protocol 
iraq is already seen as a frontrunner in a middle east drive to 
develop arsenals of longrange and surfacetosurface missiles its 
development of chemical weapons and possibly nuclear arms has 
raised fears of an arms race in the volatile region 
in israel government officials warned monday that israel would 
retaliate if hussein used chemical weapons against it 
the us state department denounced husseins chemical weapons 
threat as inflammatory irresponsible and outrageous 
hussein in a speech broadcast by baghdad radio denied iraq has 
nuclear weapons concerns about this were raised last week by the 
interception in london of 40 iraqibound trigger devices that 
officials said were designed for nuclear bombs 
i categorically deny that we have any atomic bombs the 
president said at a ceremony in baghdad where he awarded medals to 
senior military officers 
hussein claimed during the 198088 war with iran iraq was 
offered enriched uranium and even a complete atomic bomb by people 
who were either american british or zionist agents but iraq 
turned down these offers 
he did not elaborate such an offer would not be in accord with 
western efforts to block nuclear military technology to developing 
nations 
hussein warned the israelis if they try to repeat their june 
1981 air strike on a frenchbuilt nuclear reactor near baghdad he 
will retaliate with chemical weapons 
i say that if israel dares to hit even one piece of steel on 
any industrial site we will make the fire eat half of israel he 
declared 
let them hear here and now that we do possess binary 
chemical weapons which only the united states and soviet union 
have 
in a clear reference to israel believed to be the only mideast 
power with nuclear weapons hussein said those who are 
threatening us with nuclear bombs we warn them that we will hit 
them with this binary chemical weapon 
a statement issued in jerusalem by prime minister yitzhak shamir 
of israel said husseins remarks reveal once again the basic 
threat at the root of the situation in the middle east which is 
the continued aspiration to destroy israel let there be no 
doubt israel will also know how to defend itself in the future and 
defeat the evil designs of its enemies 
shamir spokesman avi pazner said we have no aggressive 
intention against anyone including iraq 
asked about a possible preemptive strike pazner said we 
dont even want to talk about that kind of thing 
western intelligence officials have long said iraq is developing 
chemical weapons at topsecret research installations 
only the united states and soviet union have officially admitted 
having binary weapons although other countries were believed to 
possess them 
in an interview with the associated press foreign ministry 
undersecretary nizar hamdoon said iraq developed the weapons during 
the iraqiran war but did not use them 
hussein said britain and the united states should recognize 
the rights of nations and peoples to defend themselves 
the iraqis have told israel several times the last two years not 
to launch preemptive strikes against its burgeoning arms industry 
baghdad says it now is capable of producing longrange missiles and 
rockets capable of putting satellites into space orbit 
in december iraq announced it had tested two missiles with a 
range of up to 1200 miles enough to reach irans capital and 
israeli cities 
hussein also made his first public comment on us and british 
allegations that iraq tried to smuggle in 40 usmade krytrons or 
electronic detonators for nuclear bomb detonators 
these are only condensors which we bought and its not 
logical that these could be used in atomic bombs he said 
the foreign ministry released photocopies of documents it said 
proved iraqs innocence and showed that a person it identified as 
an fbi agent attempted to lure iraq into ordering the triggers 
it said attempts by british and american authorities to 
portray iraq as a nuclear power are aimed at blackmailing and 
pressuring iraq to prevent iraq from acquiring scientific and 
technical knowhow 
the ministry said the devices seized at londons heathrow 
airport could be used for nuclear bombs but that iraq wanted them 
for use in a university laser system 
hussein who has ruled iraq as undisputed strongman since 1979 
said recent criticism against baghdad over its human rights record 
and its military ambitions was designed to threaten and 
intimidate iraq as well as pave the way for israel to attack 
us 
israels air force bombed iraqs osirak nuclear reactor in 1981 
while iraq was at war with iran israel claimed the plant was 
developing a nuclear bomb iraq denied it

kaiser permanente the nations largest 
health maintenance organization was hit by a strike monday by 
11000 nurses technicians and maintenance workers cutting 
services at hospitals and closing some clinics 
workers defied the recommendation of a union negotiating team 
and rejected a 44 million contract offer friday by a 
3067to1474 vote 
a sixhour negotiating session with a federal mediator ended 
saturday without an agreement between pasadenabased kaiser 
permanente and service employees international union local 399 
the companys offer includes a 5 percent to 6 percent pay raise 
in the first year and a 3 percent to 5 percent increase in the 
second and third years it also guarantees that employees wages 
are 3 percent higher than the average wage at 12 los angelesarea 
hospitals used as a yardstick 
the union said 314 job classifications were affected it 
declined to outline its contract demands 
management knows what it will take to settle the strike 
said union vice president dave stilwell who said the topwage 
guarantee was simply no match for the work demands placed on kaiser 
employees 
kaiser employees accepted a wage freeze three years ago and have 
stood by the company during nine years of financial difficulty 
said union spokesman tom ramsay 
now that kaiser is back on their feet and prospering 
employees expected some recognition and didnt get that and they 
were very angry ramsay said workload has gone up two and 
threefold and employees are still being asked to sacrifice 
the union includes licensed vocational nurses clerks 
housekeepers and radiology technicians at seven of the kaiser 
permanente medical centers and more than 40 satellite medical 
offices in los angeles and orange counties 
the hospitals affected are in los angeles west los angeles 
panorama city woodland hills harbor city bellflower and anaheim 
kaiser a nonprofit medical institute has more than 22 million 
subscribers in southern california who pay a fee for comprehensive 
health care rather than the traditional paypervisit system 
at kaisers anaheim hospital more than 100 workers walked the 
picket lines most of us here have ourselves and families to 
support its hard on both sides said joyce johnston a licensed 
vocational nurse 
kaiser said medical care will continue to be provided to 
employees not affected by the strike 
by monday afternoon about 150 kaiser patients had been 
transferred to community hospitals said company spokeswoman janice 
seib she said kaiser was trying to reduce occupied beds at 
affected hospitals to about 40 percent down from a usual 75 
percent 
she said some kaiser clinics used for annual physicals 
checkups and outpatient treatment were closed but could not say 
how many 
kaiser borrowed workers from facilities unaffected by the strike 
and postponed nonemergency surgery at affected hospitals seib 
said 
management said union leaders did a poor job of presenting the 
rejected package to members the union agreed that members were 
left confused but said the complex contract offer was handed to 
them at the last moment and was too difficult to decipher in time 
for the vote 
we did the best we could and the members still didnt 
understand and voted not to give management a blank check 
stilwell said 
the feeling generally is that they misrepresented it or 
presented it in an extremely negative way said seib 
several pickets said they might have been better informed but 
said they would still have voted to strike

john e list killed his wife three 
children and mother in 1971 with love in his heart to save 
their souls his attorney argued monday at the start of the former 
sunday school teachers murder trial 
list a strictly raised lutheran was a fragmented product 
of 19th century ethics who despaired while his family loosened 
church ties and felt himself failing as a provider said defense 
lawyer elijah l miller jr 
he was simply not equipped to cope to deal with the pressure 
of our times said miller 
arrested in virginia in june list is charged with firstdegree 
murder in the deaths of his wife mother daughter and two sons at 
his westfield mansion nov 9 1971 
on that fateful day he slipped from despair into oblivion 
he entered hell with his eyes open said miller 
he committed these acts with love in his heart for his mother 
wife and children for the salvation of his family he had to act as 
he did 
the defense contends list was mentally diseased at the time a 
diminished capacity argument that would let jurors return a 
guilty verdict to a lesser charge he is still fragmented with a 
mental disease miller said 
assistant union county prosecutor brian gillet offered a 
different picture saying list systematically executed his 
own flesh and blood 
lists 84yearold mother alma wife helen 45 daughter 
patricia 16 and sons john 15 and frederick 13 were 
unsuspecting and undeserving victims of this defendants cruel 
evil and calculating mind said gillet 
the prosecutor opened his brief statement by reading a fivepage 
letter that list had written his pastor to describe the events and 
explain that he acted out of economic distress and fear for his 
familys souls 
list slumped in his chair without apparent emotion 
gillet told the jury how list stopped the mail and milk 
deliveries wrote notes to his childrens employers and schools 
saying the family was going out of town and settled his financial 
affairs like the accountant he was list closed the books 
balanced out the accounts before he fled and took on a new life 
said the prosecutor 
his careful plan turned into a day of horror at the 18room 
mansion and become his familys worst possible nightmare 
after opening statements witnesses reconstructed the familys 
final day their testimony spoke of an idyllic suburban life where 
a car pool took the kids to school the milkman put the milk in the 
refrigerator and bank tellers knew their customers by name 
gene syfert who is married to the sister of helen list 
testified that he talked with list about a collection of crime 
books at the house during his last visit there in 1968 
he indicated that he was rather obsessed with the unsolved 
mystery syfert said 
barbara a baeder who with list ran a carpool for their 
children to and from school told how she brought john jr home 
police say he arrived early and was the only victim shot more than 
once list in his letter released last week said john struggled 
in order to snuff the life out of that young man the 
defendant needed more than 10 shots to kill him his namesake 
gillet said in his opening statement 
mrs baeders son richard 13 at the time remembered taking a 
telephone message from list the evening of nov 9 list said mrs 
baeder didnt need to pick up the children because they were going 
to visit their sick grandmother in north carolina 
herbert l argast the milkman told how he saw a note on the 
refrigerator saying no more milk until further notice it was 
written by list on a nice piece of lined paper rather than the 
usual scrap left by mrs list he said 
bank employees told how list cashed checks totaling 285 and 
2000 in savings bonds the town truant officer said she went by 
the home several times when the children did not come to school for 
several weeks

struggle was the subject of numerous accounts including a people 
magazine cover story and a televison movie 
he is presently in the intensive care unit and he is in 
critical condition kleiman told an afternoon news conference 
he is heavily sedated and we feel that he is experiencing no 
discomfort 
van dyke said his mother jeanne and his sister andrea were 
among the relatives at his bedside at riley hospital for children 
jeanne and ryan whites father wayne are divorced 
whites hemophilia the disorder that initially exposed him to 
the deadly aids virus prevented doctors from operating said van 
dyke she said she was told about whites condition by his mother 
at lunchtime 
this is it hes not expected to come out of it van dyke 
said hes not responding 
van dyke voiced a small hope white would recover saying hes 
surprised us before 
kleiman whites physician since he was diagnosed as having aids 
in 1984 said white was admitted to the hospital thursday suffering 
from a respiratory infection which occurred as a complication of 
aids 
kleiman said whites family had asked that no additional details 
of his condition be released 
whites battle with acquired immune deficiency syndrome sent him 
to washington to testify before congress and to california for 
starstudded fundraisers he had gained the support and close 
friendship of entertainers such as michael jackson and elton john 
last week he appeared with former president reagan and his 
wife nancy at a preoscar party in los angeles for sick and 
disadvantaged youths sponsored by athletes and entertainers for 
kids the organization has established the ryan white national 
education program for youth an aids education forum 
news of whites condition monday prompted a statement of concern 
from the reagans we are praying for him and his family as we are 
praying for all people with aids and their families the 
statement said 
elton john also called whites family to express concern van 
dyke said 
whites mingling with celebrities and entertainers was a cruel 
contrast to the days when aids hysteria made it impossible for him 
to mix even with his classmates when whites case first made 
headlines misinformation combined with a lack of knowledge of the 
incurable disease made white a pariah 
but he went on to become a national spokesman for children with 
aids after winning a court battle to attend school near his 
hometown of kokomo however he and his family felt ostracized 
there and moved to a new home about 20 miles away in cicero where 
they were welcomed by the local community and school system 
personally i would rather have given it up a long time ago 
mrs white said during the court battle it would have been a lot 
easier on me and a lot easier on the rest of the family 
but believe it or not ryan has always really loved school 
andrea his sister says boy i wish it would be me that could 
stay home but this is what ryan wants to do and i want what he 
wants 
his life story was told in a television movie last year and an 
education program called i have aids a teenagers story a 
321 contact extra which white helped develop it was nominated 
for an emmy and won a george peabody award and an ollie award 
white enjoyed collecting comic books swimming and customizing 
his red mustang he also owned two dogs wally and gizmo although 
his doctors advised the family against having pets 
mrs white said she allowed her son to have the dogs because she 
was unable to tell him another thing he wanted was out of reach 
because he had aids 
ryan said its my life and i want a pup he said i want a 
pup that likes no one but me she said 
white was diagnosed as having aids in 1984 when he was 13 he 
contracted the disease through blood products he received to treat 
his hemophilia a disorder that impairs the bloods ability to clot 
and stop bleeding 
i dont think its the aids as much as hes a hemophiliac and 
hes bleeding internally and thats the problem van dyke said 
she said white was in poor health before thanksgiving when they 
prepared several public service announcements for world aids day on 
dec 7 
white dropped out of classes at hamilton heights high school 
before christmas she said officials there could not be reached 
for comment monday because the school was on spring break 
white turned 18 on dec 16 in continued ill health with a low 
blood platelet count and staph infections in his eyes and legs 
the national centers for disease control in atlanta says it has 
recorded 2055 cases of aids among children since june 1981 as of 
january accounting for 2 percent of the total number of aids 
patients 
there are 1207 hemophilia patients with aids or 1 percent the 
cdc said in its latest statistics released in march transfusion or 
blood related cases account for 3 percent of the total number of 
aids cases or 72153 cases it said

inmates at long lartin prison 
attempted a mass breakout monday night and about 30 convicts 
barricaded themselves on a prison landing after guards foiled the 
escape bid the home office reported 
at a second prison in central england strangeways prison at 
manchester nearly 100 inmates ran loose monday but guards regained 
control of much of the riotdamaged facility and officials were in 
contact with the remaining inmates still inside authorities said 
the home office which is responsible for prisons said in a 
statement that guards at lowsecurity long lartin grabbed a group 
of prisoners as they tried to scale the 15foot wire mesh perimeter 
fence the guards led them back into the building without violence 
it said 
the statement did not say how many inmates tried to break out 
but said other inmates immediately began demonstrating forcing 
guards to retreat 
the home office said about 30 prisoners barricaded themselves on 
one of the landings of a prison wing and kept guards at bay early 
tuesday 
at strangeways prisoners hung up a flag saying no dead but 
the government said deaths could not be ruled out in one of 
britains worst prison riots 
authorities said 37 inmates and 12 prison guards had been 
injured since riots began sunday at strangeways one of the most 
crowded jails in britain news media reported unconfirmed accounts 
of up to 12 deaths 
prison staff regained control of four cell blocks and the 
kitchen monday after scores of inmates surrendered rioters still 
held five blocks said the home office 
the home office said 99 prisoners were still loose but ivor 
serle chairman of the strangeways prison officers association 
put the number at 80 to 90 after more men surrendered in the 
evening 
serle said he was in three wings of the prison and saw no bodies 
about a dozen masked inmates remained on the steep roofs in the 
night cold waving and shouting 
i think it will go on until tomorrow theyve got plenty 
of food plenty of drugs and plenty of fresh air serle said 
referring to looting of hospital storerooms 
home secretary david waddington said some surrendering prisoners 
claimed a number of inmates were dead but no bodies were found 
but the possibility that fatalities have occurred cannot be 
ruled out he added 
he said nine surrendering prisoners claimed to have been 
forcibly injected with drugs by other inmates 
the riot highlighted britains muchcriticized prison system 
with a prison population of 47000 britain has the highest number 
of inmates per capita in western europe 
redbrick strangeways prison built in 1868 to hold 970 men 
contained 1648 prisoners sunday it is a local jail and contains 
inmates of all categories from extremely dangerous to low risk 
the home office said 
roy hattersley the opposition labor partys deputy leader said 
82 oneman cells were crammed with three prisoners and 96 single 
cells housed two inmates each the inmates were confined to these 
cells for all but 11 hours a week and were allowed one shower and 
one change of clothing each week 
if you treat men like animals we ought not to be surprised if 
they behave like animals hattersley said 
dr philip randall of north manchester general hospital said 
most of the more serious injuries were caused by prisoners 
assaulting other prisoners 
by late afternoon 1458 inmates had been transferred to prisons 
and 74 were awaiting transport the home office said 
the prison governor has been in touch with the prisoners all 
day long said home office spokesman roy payne there has been 
no confrontation no demands and no threat 
police with riot gear were on standby along with squads of 
armed officers 
no clear indication emerged as to what caused the rioting it 
began during sunday morning service in the prison chapel when 
inmates grabbed keys from guards and used them to gain access to 
large areas of the facility 
the inmates started fires at one point it was feared the 
19thcentury victorian prison would burn down 
if you imagine a bomb dropped in world war ii in a builtup 
area thats what it looks like john bartell national chairman 
of the prison officers association said monday theyve ripped 
off landing rails wire netting and doors anything has can be 
damaged has been damaged they have burned down a number of 
buildings 
he said the prison management was warned that there would be a 
serious disturbance this weekend and he accused the home office 
of criminal negligence for leaving only five guards to 
supervise 300 men in the chapel 
home office minister david mellor who first called the 
allegation ridiculous later said in a sky news interview i 
gather there was some information given to the governor that he 
regarded as very much the same kind of information hed received on 
several previous occasions when nothing had happened

lava from kilauea volcano on monday 
flowed toward a subdivision of 83 homes in this coastal town and 
authorities ordered most of the residents to evacuate by nightfall 
the slowmoving flow was half a mile from kalapana gardens 
subdivision in the morning a lava flow in 1986 destroyed dozens of 
homes in the same area 
hawaii county civil defense administrator harry kim ordered 
residents in 50 of the houses to evacuate and placed the town on 
alert meaning residents in about 150 homes could be ordered to 
evacuate within 72 hours 
earlier authorities evacuated four outlying homes as the flow 
crossed kalapana bypass highway which lies between the town and a 
lava vent six miles upslope 
lava came within 300 yards of the houses then turned eastward 
toward the subdivision said civil defense spokesman lanny nakano 
the flow posed a serious threat because the only route to the 
ocean is through a populated area said hawaiian volcano 
observatory spokesman reggie okamura 
its just a matter of time if it keeps going okamura said 
authorities also were monitoring a finger of lava to the east 
which was following the course of the 1986 flow that flow was 
threequarters of a mile upslope from the highway 
since its latest and longest eruption began in january 1983 the 
volcano has destroyed 76 homes and a national park visitor center 
causing 20 million in damage

president rafael leonardo callejas 
of honduras said monday the top military commander of the contra 
rebels has agreed to disband his forces 
in tegucigalpa honduras a contra spokesman said all rebel 
forces remaining in that country will surrender their weapons to 
un monitors on april 18 
in an accord march 23 a lowerranking contra commander agreed 
to demobilize but deep divisions remain in the rebel ranks with 
many rankandfile fighters saying they wont lay down their arms 
by the time the new nicaraguan government takes office on april 25 
callejas made his announcement when he arrived in nicaragua for 
a twoday summit with four other central american presidents in 
montelimar a new beach resort 40 miles from the capital managua 
the top item on the agenda was demobilizing the usbacked 
contras who have waged a 10year war against nicaraguas leftist 
government 
callejas said top rebel commander israel galeano also known as 
commander franklyn had assured him the contras would disband by 
the time presidentelect violeta barrios de chamorro is sworn in 
the honduran president spoke with reporters after meetings with 
mrs chamorro and roman catholic cardinal miguel obando y bravo in 
managua the cardinal witnessed the march accord in honduras 
between contras representatives and those of mrs chamorro 
there have been doubts about the viability of the accord because 
galeano did not sign it and thousands of contras have since 
returned to nicaragua with their guns 
the accord said the rebels in honduran base camps would 
demobilize by april 20 but it did not set a deadline for those on 
nicaraguan territory in addition many of the rebels who were in 
honduras have reportedly slipped back into nicaragua 
but callejas said monday that galeano has assured him his forces 
will disband by april 25 
in tegucigalpa contra spokesman alejandro acevedo announced 
that all contras in honduras will surrender their arms to a un 
peacekeeping force a week earlier april 18 
other rebels inside nicaragua will gather inside security zones 
to surrender their arms as specified in the march accord acevedo 
said in an interview he said the decision was made by galeano and 
the rebel high command 
he said the formal surrender of weapons by forces in honduras 
will take place at yamales a small town near the nicaraguan border 
acevedo said their weapons consist mainly of sovietdesigned 
ak47 assault rifles cannons rocketpropelled grenades 
surfacetoair missiles machine guns and mortars he refused to 
specify quantities 
president oscar arias of costra rica spoke enthusiastically of 
peace prospects when he arrived in managua on monday 
he said callejas has brought me the good news that the contras 
and commander franklyn are in total agreement on complete 
demobilization 
arias said that never before in the last 3 years have we felt 
as optimistic as now 
arias won the nobel peace prize in 1987 for working out the 
first of a series of central american peace accords aimed at ending 
civil wars in the region 
he said he was certain the regions presidents would reach an 
agreement that would encourage the contras to hand over their guns 
to a un demobilization force 
as for the civil war in el salvador arias said he expected 
substantive agreements on a dialogue between the usbacked 
rightist government and the leftist guerrillas 
also attending the summit are salvadoran president alfredo 
cristiani guatemalan president vinicio cerezo and outgoing 
sandinista president daniel ortega of nicaragua

the us supreme court on monday refused to 
allow california to carry out its first execution in 23 years 
letting stand an order blocking robert alton harris trip to the 
state gas chamber 
harris 37 who in 1978 kidnapped and murdered two san diego 
teenagers to use their car in a 3000 bank robbery had been 
scheduled to die in the gas chamber at 3 am tuesday 
however a federal appeals court judge imposed the stay friday 
and the nations highest court voted 63 monday to reject an 
emergency request from prosecutors who wanted to execute harris on 
schedule 
because of the supreme courts action one of californias most 
notorious criminal cases could drag on for months the case which 
focuses on harris mental condition will return to the 9th us 
circuit court of appeals prosecutors said 
there is no legal or moral reason why the execution should 
not proceed as scheduled state attorney general john van de kamp 
said in papers filed with the supreme court there has never been 
a question robert alton harris killed the two helpless victims in 
cold blood 
the request went to justice sandra day oconnor who referred it 
to the full court chief justice william h rehnquist and justices 
antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy voted to set aside the stay 
of execution and let harris die voting in the majority were 
justices oconnor thurgood marshall william brennan john paul 
stevens byron white and harry blackmun 
my own reaction in a sense is one of disappointment said 
van de kamp who personally opposes capital punishment 
relatives of harris two 16yearold victims were angered and 
saddened by the justices decision 
this is unbelievable its unfair theyve heard all these 
arguments before said william stalder of carlsbad uncle of 
victim john mayeski theres nothing new im finished with it 
linda herring of escondido sister of victim michael baker said 
she expected the decision 
what are they going to do let him sit in jail and rot she 
said everybody protects the criminals but what about us i just 
hope this doesnt happen to too many people but it will and 
theyll just get the same that we did no justice 
in sacramento gov george deukmejian said he was disappointed 
and frustrated by the supreme courts decision 
deukmejians voice rose steadily as he listed three appeals of 
the harris case to the california supreme court five appeals to 
the federal court and five appeals to the us supreme court since 
the original death sentence 11 years ago 
and still no resolution still no justice just delay delay 
and more delay deukmejian said at a news conference 
but death penalty opponents lauded the high courts decision to 
let the stay remain and planned to turn their vigil at the san 
quentin gates into a celebration 
we are tremendously relieved that california will not become a 
killer tonight said martha kegel spokeswoman for death penalty 
focus of california 
harris would be the nations 122nd convicted killer put to death 
since the supreme courts 1976 decision that allowed executions to 
resume since january 1977 13 states mostly in the south have 
executed prisoners trendsetting california would be the most 
populous state to carry out a death sentence 
california voters overwhelmingly favored executing harris 
reflecting the publics longstanding support for capital 
punishment a statewide poll found 
according to the los angeles times poll released monday 60 
percent said they favored harris execution 16 percent were 
opposed 5 percent were undecided and 19 percent hadnt heard 
enough to respond 
during the sixday telephone survey 1667 registered voters 
were asked if they favored the execution of harris noting he would 
be the first to die in the california gas chamber since 1967 the 
margin of error is 3 percent 
death penalty opponents held a prayer vigil a few miles from san 
quentin 
this execution will of course make many feel that justice has 
been done many will feel avenged but many of us will feel sad 
because we know the cycle of violence and death will continue 
said roman catholic archbishop john quinn of san francisco 
we know that robert harris death will not stop the hatred 
the crime and the violence which rages in our cities and towns 
quinn told about 75 people who attended the service in the chapel 
of the 172yearold mission san rafael before a march to the prison 
prosecutors asked the supreme court to intervene after a 
conservative federal appeals judge in san francisco issued the 
stay saying further studies of harris mental condition may be 
necessary 
the decision by judge john noonan of the 9th us circuit court 
of appeals came after identical defense arguments that harris had 
inadequate psychiatric help at the time of his trial and may have 
mental disorders were rejected by the state supreme court and a 
federal judge in san diego

conoco inc said monday it has proposed 
a 23 million settlement that would involve buying nearly 400 
houses where residents say the groundwater was tainted with 
hydrocarbons 
conoco lawyer mark zehler said he believed the agreement is one 
of the largest relocation settlements ever in the country 
conoco agreed to the settlement because it is the right thing 
to do for these residents for ponca city and for conoco said 
the oil refinerys manager dennis parker 
two comparable cases involved government money the evacuation 
of homes built atop tons of chemical waste at love canal in niagara 
falls ny and the virtual abandonment of times beach mo which 
was tainted by dioxin the love canal buyout involved about 19 
million to purchase 232 homes in times beach about 33 million 
was spent to buy 393 properties 
the conoco proposal which must be approved by a federal judge 
in oklahoma city calls for the company to buy almost 400 houses 
and residential lots and to establish a 5 million settlement fund 
conoco said the property acquisition could cost 18 million 
anthony roisman a lawyer for the residents says anyone 
involved in the lawsuit will be entitled to share in the fund 
conoco does not have the number of plaintiffs involved in the 
classaction suit said lynn hohensee a company spokesman 
conoco said the settlement would resolve the lawsuit without 
either party admitting liability or responsibility for any claims 
injuries or damages 
homeowners in the circle drive residential area in southwest 
ponca city had complained since 1987 that groundwater laced with 
hydrocarbons seeped into their basements and threatened their 
health some residents camped out at the state capitol in oklahoma 
city for weeks in 1988 to get the state to buy their houses 
to conoco and du pont we say thank you in coming forth with 
this settlement said resident anna sue rafferty id just like 
to say none of us is happy to be leaving our home no one intended 
to get rich 
conoco is a subsidiary of du pont inc 
conoco had noted that other oil refinery operations have been 
based in the area over the years 
there has been steady progress on the technical aspects of a 
groundwater remediation effort parker said there has not been 
corresponding resolution of the many difficulties experienced by 
the people and those considerations also deserve our attention 
if approved the settlement would allow owners and renters of 
property within a certain area of the northern oklahoma city to 
receive financial payments and relocate residents of a larger area 
of the neighborhood could receive payments because of their 
proximity to the groundwater problems and the activities needed to 
fix it 
a hearing on the proposal is scheduled june 5 in oklahoma city 
conoco would pay residents who participate the appraised value 
of their homes an above marketvalue premium a moving and 
household disruption bonus and various other bonuses and incentives 
zehler said residents would have six months from when the 
settlement is approved to seek an appraisal

a summary of developments in the news industry for the week of 
march 26april 2 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the newspaper industrys reluctance to 
embrace videotex threatens to create a vacuum that telephone 
companies and others eventually will fill a top newspaper 
executive said march 26 
we ought to be asking ourselves if we are not in the local 
information business instead of the newspaper business said 
phillip j meek president of the publishing division of capital 
citiesabc inc and former publisher of the fort worth 
startelegram 
speaking at the annual meeting of the texas daily newspaper 
association meek chided the industry for failing to pursue 
videotex computerdelivered information 
he said the failure could leave the market open for telephone 
companies and other competitors 
the newspaper industry has fought efforts by american telephone 
amp telegraph co and some regional phone companies to provide 
information over existing lines but meek said he is frustrated 
and alarmed that nothing is happening within the industry to fill 
the void 
although currently restricted sooner or later if newspapers 
dont do something the phone companies ought to come in meek 
said 
some large newspaper chains have offered videotex services with 
little success and some experts doubt videotex will develop a 
following among the general public 
meek said those past failures have scared off other newspaper 
ventures 
its a narrow audience but its a decent business said 
meek who oversaw the creation of startext a videotex service of 
the fort worth newspaper 
meek said startext begun in 1982 now has about 4200 
subscribers in the dallasfort worth area more than prodigy a 
similar venture of ibm and sears roebuck and co 
newspapers must also be aware of attempts to slice up their 
traditional markets he said pointing to the proliferation of free 
publications that advertise homes jobs cars and other items that 
normally make up a newspapers classified ad section 
suggesting the industry provide some of those publications he 
said if it makes sense its going to happen 
meek also called on the executives to fight proposed changes in 
us postal service regulations that would reduce the mailing costs 
of saturation publications while raising fees for newspapers by 
20 per thousand 
its an unfair break to one segment of direct mail that just 
puts pressures on newspapers he said

a suburban kansas city publisher said 
march 29 he plans to launch an afternoon tabloid newspaper designed 
to appeal to news addicts in the wake of the shutdown of the 
afternoon kansas city star

inc said the evening news will be published monday through friday 
beginning may 14

international news provided by the associated press business news 
and national and local sports 
it will be sold at newsstands convenience stores and newspaper 
racks throughout the metropolitan area but wont be distributed to 
homes which rose said would boost expenses and require earlier 
news deadlines 
we expect it to appeal to busy people who want more 
information people who dont want to wait 24 hours to find out 
what happened today rose said 
on march 1 the kansas city star co stopped publishing the 
afternoon star merged it with the morning times and began 
publishing a sevenday morning newspaper called the kansas city 
star 
we certainly felt it left a vacuum rose said 
joe mcguff editor of the star said he didnt know enough

geneva college closed its student 
newspaper march 26 for the rest of the semester after it published 
an editorial critical of roman catholics 
geneva is affiliated with the reformed presbyterian church 
though catholics comprise the largest religious group on campus 
the decision came as the result of a firestorm of complaints 
about editor eric dugans editorial said college spokesman william 
gibbs 
the editorial in the cabinet titled theology of the pointy 
hats says senior clerics in the catholic church who were 
referred to as pointy hats have become authoritarian and 
their councils and traditions supersede scripture 
the editorial says protestants use the bible to assess the 
validity of their leaders statements 
the catholic however finds most of his faith and practice 
moored in the sayings of popes and councils which frequently 
contradict each other the editorial says and just what if one 
pope isnt exactly holy his words are still law 
the editorial closes he who holds to teachings which 
contradict the bible finds a final resting place with the serpent 
gibbs said the decision to close the paper wasnt censorship but 
was an apology to genevas students particularly catholics who 
account for about onefifth of the 1200 students 
dugan said the board acted out of fear the college would lose 
students and tuition 
the college has responded in the way it has in my opinion 
not because of its theological persuasion but because of the 
wealth of their pocketbooks he said

nordstrom inc says its decision to cut 
advertising in seattles two daily newspapers was not linked to 
coverage of the apparel retailers labor problems 
cindy demme nordstrom vice president for sales promotion said 
on march 27 the upscale clothing retailer had been trying different 
mixes of advertising media in other markets and wanted to do the 
same in seattle 
the company cut its ads in the seattle times and the seattle 
postintelligencer from three fullpage and three smaller ads on 
march 22 to one full page a week later 
the newspapers share joint business and advertising functions 
but have separate editorial operations under a joint operating 
agreement 
times ad director marji ruiz said nordstrom is one of the 
afternoon papers top 10 advertisers 
nordstroms stormy labor relations and declining profits and 
stock prices have received extensive media coverage including a 
frontpage article in the wall street journal detailing complaints 
of past and present employees reporter susan c faludi said she 
interviewed more than 30 people for the story 
company cochairman jim nordstrom called the times coverage 
horrible worse than the wall street journal because that girl 
didnt know us she just regurgitated what the union said 
michael fancher times executive editor said he felt no 
pressure to alter coverage 
i think its important for readers to understand that when 
advertisers purchase an ad they are buying exposure to our 
readers nothing more and nothing less were a neutral

the renamed and redesigned saint paul 
pioneer press debuted march 26 with changes intended to make the 
newspaper more attractive and accessible to readers 
the newspaper which had been known as the st paul pioneer 
press dispatch since 1986 dropped dispatch to shorten the 
name publisher john henry said in a column published march 25 
the word saint is spelled out in the new name to reinforce 
and leave no doubt about thng 
guidelines to be applied uniformly in federal courts 
but judges must use discretion in deciding which convicts will 
pay for their prison stay only those who can afford the monthly 
payment of 121005 plus 9166 a month during probation can be 
ordered to pay 
those fees calculated by the us bureau of prisons cannot be 
imposed if they would leave the defendants family destitute or on 
welfare said paul martin a commission spokesman 
it was kind of a very simple thought select those folks who 
have the ability to pay for their cost of incarceration or 
supervision martin said its mainly earmarked of course for 
the white collar defendant someone who has some financial 
resource 
of the 45000 cases that reach federal court every year few 
criminals appear to fit the bill 
most people who are put away in the federal court system are 
indigent they dont have a dime ive had clients who didnt have 
enough money to buy a sixpack of beer said ron wheeler an 
attorney in des moines 
last year wheeler represented a university of iowa student 
charged with possessing lsd with the intent to sell the student 
matthew follett of kenilworth ill pleaded guilty 
in august us district judge charles wolle sentenced follett 
to seven years in prison plus four years of probation 
noting that follett had a substantial trust fund wolle also 
fined follett 20000 and ordered him to pay for his prison stay 
plus the monthly fee during probation 
i dont have any problem with that at all wheeler said 
if theyre convicted and can pay the cost of being kept in 
prison i think they should 
it looks nice on paper but in actuality there arent a lot 
of these kinds of defendants 
in february in another drugrelated case us district judge 
francis j boyle of providence ri ordered three men accused of 
supplying 75 percent of the citys heroin to pay the costs of their 
confinement 
its the just thing to do boyle said at the time to the 
extent that a defendant is able to pay for it the defendant should 
be required to 
wilkins and others who support the program say requiring inmates 
to pay for imprisonment isnt meant as a deterrent 
the deterrent effect comes through the imposition of a prison 
term the judge said 
one critic of the program is alvin j bronstein director of the 
national prison project of the american civil liberties union who 
noted that the federal prison system is running at 170 percent of 
capacity and getting worse every month 
it is clear to me that federal prisons today are basically 
unconstitutional because of the conditions of overcrowding 
inadequate medical care and all the problems created by that mass 
of overcrowding he said 
it seems unseemly and highly inappropriate if not illegal 
to be requiring defendants to pay for room and board or the cost 
of being incarcerated in an unconstitutional facility bronstein 
said

western journalists covering lithuanias standoff 
with moscow from the baltic republics capital were ordered to 
leave the country and most if not all were out by april 1 
more than 100 journalists based in moscow and other european 
capitals followed events from vilnius before they were ordered to 
leave 
despite the greater freedom of movement permitted under 
glasnost soviet authorities have routinely closed areas stricken 
by ethnic violence to foreign journalists some regions regarded as 
strategically or politically sensitive are closed at all times 
others only temporarily 
the order restricting journalists access to lithuania came as 
the kremlin increased pressure on the rebellious republic and as 
lithuanian leaders sought to use the western media to protect them 
from a use of force to crush their effort to establish an 
independent state 
moscowbased foreign journalists must give the soviet foreign 
ministry advance notice of any plans to travel outside the soviet 
capital including the dates and means of their travel and where 
they will stay outside moscow

a judge on march 27 dismissed the lawsuit of 
a minneapolis woman who alleged that glamour magazine went too far 
in identifying her in a story about sexual exploitation by 
therapists 
the woman agreed to provide the magazine details of the sexual 
abuse she suffered during psychiatric therapy in 1979 and 1980 but 
she had asked not to be identified or identifiable in the story 
and sued the conde nast publishing inc and writer claudia dreifus 
for breach of contract 
even though the september 1988 article gave the woman a 
fictitious last name it went on to describe her as a minneapolis 
attorney and gave specifics about her activism on issues involving 
sexual abuse of patients by therapists 
us district judge harry h maclaughlin said the agreement 
between dreifus and the woman was too ambiguous to be enforced 
dreifus had testified that the woman wanted some kind of 
masking but was very casual about it according to court 
records the judge said dreifus honored the womans only specific 
masking request by not describing problems she had at one of 
her previous jobs 
the woman knows only two people who identified her from the 
article and they had been therapists for her the judge said the 
article portrayed the woman as someone who successfully recovered 
from an exploitative situation maclaughlin wrote 
to enforce reportersource agreements in litigation plaintiffs 
at a minimum must prove specific unambiguous terms and to 
provide clear and convincing proof that the agreement was 
breached the judge wrote 
the court has no doubt that in balancing the rights of the 
free press with common contractual rights the free press rights 
under the first amendment must be given preference the decision 
said 
elliot rothenberg of minneapolis the womans attorney said he 
is discussing with his client the possibility of an appeal

a divided indiana supreme court in a case 
watched closely by media groups across the nation ruled march 27 
that two newspaper reporters cant be held in contempt of court for 
questioning former members of a grand jury 
in a 32 decision the court threw out earlier state court of 
appeals decisions that said reporter mark kiesling of the times of 
hammond and william heltzel formerly a reporter at the paper 
could be held in contempt because they violated the secrecy of the 
grand jury system 
the contempt citations were sought by former lake county 
prosecutor jack f crawford after the times published stories in 
1987 detailing why a grand jury impaneled in 1984 didnt return 
indictments in an investigation of a township trustees office in 
that county 
a lake county court had thrown out the contempt request before 
the court of appeals in two 1989 decisions ruled that the secrecy 
of the grand jury was of paramount importance and the reporters 
could be punished for inducing jurors to violate hat secrecy 
the threejustice majority of the supreme court held that while 
the reporters actions werent protected by the freedom of the 
press guarantee in the first amendment they didnt rise to the 
level of contempt because the questioning of the jurors occurred 
long after the jury had been dismissed 
the court said the need to protect the secrecy of the grand jury 
is at its peak while the grand jury is in the process of hearing 
testimony deliberating and voting once the proceedings are over 
and the grand jurors have been discharged however the need to 
protect these policies falls off dramatically 
the court took note of a recent us supreme court decision 
striking down a florida law permanently barring grand jury 
witnesses from talking about their testimony however the indiana 
justices said that because their decision was focused narrowly on 
the issue of contempt they didnt have to address the larger issue 
of permanent bans on disclosure of grand jury information 
were absolutely delighted said jan m carroll who filed a 
friendofthe court brief on behalf of a group of media 
organizations including the american society of newspaper editors 
and the society of professional journalists 
this case had farreaching effects not only for reporters but 
for any citizen who had the temerity to ask questions about a grand 
jury said carroll

about 2 million per year expires in july pilson said money

minorities say theyve gotten a small toehold 
in broadcasting thanks to 18yearold rules that give them 
preference in seeking radio and television station licenses 
the federal communications commissions minority and female 
preference rules have allowed missing voices to be heard 
backers of the rules told the supreme court on march 28 
opponents however said the rules discriminate against white 
males they contended the rules should be dropped and the 
marketplace should determine the bidding 
minority ownership of the countrys stations has increased from 
1 percent a few years ago to 3 percent 
two cases in florida and connecticut involve challenges to 
broadcast minority preferences 
its clear that the court is very troubled by what the fcc is

decide how much programming they want for free 
legislative efforts are under way to allow price controls in 
areas where cable companies have monopolies and to enable 
communities to better ride herd on the service the companies

continental cablevision is returning a 
hit show for a second season on its public access channel live 
coverage of a falcon nest from the 21st story of a downtown 
building 
a camera mounted near the nest was switched back on march 26 
with the spring return of two peregrine falcons that spend their 
summer on a ledge on the 23story monarch place office building 
it amazes me that someone can sit and watch the birds hour 
after hour said continental general manager brian lambert i 
am one of them it stays on in the office all day long we just 
kind of wait to see the bird move or the eggs or whatever its 
mesmerizing 
running cable to the building and mounting the camera behind 
reflective glass cost about 10000 lambert said 
we often joke around the office that we spend tens and 
hundreds of thousands of dollars on new customer service features 
or new programming services and almost as a second thought we 
covered the peregrine falcons story and overnight it became an 
instant success lambert said

fighting one of the last battles of the cold war an intense 
struggle to influence us policy in the obscure african country of 
angola 
it is one of the last skirmishes left for the united states and 
soviet union neither is willing to abandon its allies in angola 
but neither is either side willing to let the civil war there hold 
up overall improvements in their relationship 
while the bush administrations approach is low key 
conservatives in washington have adopted a highly visible stance

ilona nagy is all for democracy but it 
doesnt solve the problem of how to pay a 74 electricity bill and 
still keep a family of six going on the rest of 300 a month 
the monthly budget would be much smaller if she did not have a 
second job her husband daniel has left a secure government 
position to form a private partnership so his income is uncertain 
you have to work out a strategy to survive said mrs nagy 
a 45yearold folklore specialist at the academy of sciences who is 
fluent in english and german i work about 70 to 80 hours a 
week 
her monthly net salary of about 135 after 20 years at the 
academy illustrates how the former communist regime treated most 
intellectuals who were not party members 
a few intellectuals got into the bureaucracy but most faced a 
combination of punishment for dissent and pay lower than that of 
bluecollar workers 
mrs nagy works as a parttime editor of folklore literature to 
supplement the family income and three of her four children take 
odd jobs for pocket money two boys study at budapest universities 
more liberty has been a mixed blessing to the nagys 
with democracy has come greater inflation now approaching a 
yearly rate of 20 percent also mrs nagy often has visiting 
mouths to feed because her husband is a hungarian from 
transylvania in neighboring romania and the revolution there has 
given his relatives freedom to travel 
in this situation i cant care too much about politics but 
one has to think that things will be getting better after all 
mrs nagy told an interviewer in her budapest apartment 
i see the political changes as terribly interesting but in 
our everyday life the situation has not changed you realize that 
with every month the economic situation worsens 
relatives arrive from transylvania in western romania in 
groups of three or four and stay for varying periods 
umpteen times its been like this the door bell rings and

what his income will be from the new partnership 
for a long time i havent bought a new dress she said 
most everything we wear has been bought at a secondhand shop 
to find something suitable there is fun of a kind it is also 
interesting because people who do their purchasing there are 
very poor those who have to eke out a living with very little 
money 
worsening economic conditions have impoverished onefifth of 
hungarys 107 million people hungarians generally seem to feel 
economic problems will be with them for a long time whatever a new 
democratic government does

much lies behind the tower of londons mustached 
beefeaters cobblestone lanes and ravens including ted smith and 
son armorers who preserve an ancient craft from extinction 
the two royal armory craftsmen and five assistants restore and 
conserve the 40000 pieces of armor in the tower collection 
smith 62 will retire in 1992 and is passing on his knowledge 
of making and repairing armor to his 26yearold son christopher 
behind a bright red door away from the crown jewels and the 2 
million tourists who flock to the 900yearold tower each year the 
smiths work together on a replica of a knights fighting helmet 
made in northern italy in 1460 
their one concession to modernity is a propane torch all other 
materials and methods are authentic to the time 
medieval armorers used cumbersome coal forges a propane torch 
makes it easier to work on those awkward lancerests and chanfrons 
we had a small forge for awhile but it blew up a couple of 
times and with a gallery directly above us it wouldnt have been 
practical ted smith explained 
for the rounded helmet which juts out at the back to protect 
the neck ted smith wields the torch while his son strikes on the 
fires bright orange stain with a large chisel their unprotected 
faces redden as they lean over the hot metal 
chris smith is logging their work and plans to publish an 
illustrated guide to armormaking 
medieval armorers were too busy preparing knights for battle to 
leave manuals for future generations armor died out and the 
trade was never carried on ted smith said 
because conservation work for the royal armory collection 
intervenes the smiths need several months to finish a helmet an 
unacceptably long time by medieval standards 
they would have been quicker because they were more skilled at 
it ted smith said they made helmets all of the time whereas 
we can go five to 10 years without making a helmet 
the finished replicas get a handson and onheads going over by 
school children at educational demonstrations tower of london 
spokeswoman cathy butler said 
chris smith has long curly hair his father is balding and 
wears glasses both have a mild affability and look in their white 
coats more suited to a family drugstore than a medieval armor shop 
ted smith went to work at the armory in 1949 after a time at 
the wilkinson sword company and chris joined him immediately after 
graduating from school 
they are proud of their heritage woodcuts of medieval armorers 
hang on the workshop walls 
an armorer was considered a top craftsman ted smith said he 
would have worked for the king in the kings armory or for a 
nobleman he said the more you see the more you appreciate 
what they did those old people 
they were damned good said his son we could never get 
the skill here unless we did it for 40 years 
besides the helmet chris smith is assembling a 16thcentury 
flemish suit of armor used for jousting the lower left arm plate 
came from the philadelphia museum of art in exchange for a 
chanfron the armor that protects the horses head 
exhibits in the tower collection date from the arrival of 
william the conqueror in 1066 they include armor worn by several 
english kings among them charles i charles ii and james ii 
also on show is the only surviving suit of armor for an 
elephant a trophy of robert clive when he defeated the french in 
india in 1757 
constant restoration is needed because of air and dust corrosion 
to items in the collection 
the royal armorers spend a small portion of their time restoring 
privately owned suits of armor sent in from ancestral homes 
fees are determined by the amount of work necessary 
we stick to that rule since i once told someone 100 pounds on 
the phone and itrequired much more work chris smith said

in a capital that takes itself very very 
seriously there is a yearly ritual that cuts pomposity down a 
notch it happens in the speeches and the entertainment at a series 
of formal dinners none so formal and so venerable as the dinner of 
the gridiron club 
president bush was there saturday night watching satirical 
skits about his administration and the rest of the political 
establishment and recalling the observation of television 
commentator david brinkley that this city is nowhere near as 
important as it thinks it is 
bush joined in the jokes about the government he leads and 
about himself he imitated the comics who mimic his sometimes 
choppy semisentences lots of comedians up there doing 
impersonations okay with me 
natural disasters out of bounds california earthquake not 
my fault san andreas fault 
the 105th of the whitetie gridiron dinners featured such acts 
as 
a walking stalk of broccoli seven feet tall led on stage and 
announced as room service for bush 
the alphabet song rewritten to lampoon vice president dan 
quayle 
a i alectable 
b im bice president 
c cocomo thinks i am swell 
a song explaining why senators bill bradley and albert gore 
and new york gov mario cuomo dont seem interested in running for 
president in 1992 
now george bush is kinder and hes gentle 
next to ronald reagan almost mental 
so our calculations elemental 
we cannot win it 
so why get in it 
the gridiron club is an organization with 60 active members 
washingtonbased reporters and editors for newspapers and wire 
services it has no noticeable purpose other than its fancy spring 
dinner and satirical show while irreverence is its mission the 
club itself is not immune from the pomposity it seeks each year to 
puncture warranting some selfsatire 
we know that gathered tonight are dozens of the most famous 
most influential and most admired men and women in the nation 
david s broder of the washington post the club president said 
saturday night to say nothing of those who are here as our 
guests 
then he turned to bush and praised the way the administration 
ousted panamanian dictator manuel noriega you lure him into this 
place he thinks is safe cut him off from the outside world 
you move in your people and block all the exits 
and then glory be you bombard him for hours on end with 
loud bad music broder recounted hell mr president thats 
a perfect description of the gridiron dinner 
bush knows the circuit of course at the blacktie dinner of 
the alfalfa club in january the president lamented the evening 
lasted so long i was about ready to call the papal nuncio to spring 
me the alfalfa club is an organization of 200 political and 
business leaders who invite 300 guests to an annual stag dinner at 
which politicians make fun of themselves and each other 
at this years 77th dinner sen david boren dokla said bush 
had told him that dealing with congress was like his fishing 
expeditions hours of matching wits with tinybrained creatures 
with nothing to show for it 
boren also said he was pessimistic about closing the trade gap 
with japan it seems the only commodity the japanese are 
interested in buying is ronald reagan 
the former presidents 2 million honorarium prompted a gridiron 
song easy street that began with a reagan explanation 
it was only a speech for fujkisankei 
a mere two million a modest fee 
at the formal dinner of the radio and television correspondents 
association last week bush joked about the phony telephone call he 
took from a man claiming to be iranian president hashemi rafsanjani 
today i got him back bush said called him up and asked 
if he had prince abdul in a can but then i forgot to say let him 
out in farsi 
at saturdays affair bush needled his press secretary marlin 
fitzwater about his weight saying he had gone shopping marlin 
said id like to see a bathing suit in my size and the clerk 
said so would i 
he also had a crack about the toughguy reputation of his chief 
of staff john sununu saying that on a latin american trip they 
had to restrain him remember john bite the taco shake the 
hand 
it all goes to the same point and bush made it saying that the 
lesson should not be about influence as much as deflating 
selfimportance

you get bombarded by commercials you see steamy 
scenes of amour youre deluged by filmhawking celebrities youve 
got cable channels galore but is la law ever interrupted by 
a call to prayer 
no but this is american tv and it can be bemusing to an 
american returning home after years abroad the last three in 
bahrain that small island nation in the persian gulf just off the 
coast of saudi arabia 
bahrain has oil wells rollsroyces with goldplated brightwork 
about half a million people and lots of desert but compared to 
whats on the tube in the us television in that vast wasteland 
is not a vast wasteland 
being in the center of the islamic world its tv programs are 
regularly interrupted by the moslem call to prayer but prayer 
never hurt a viewer 
all the commercials and othershow promotions here can drive you 
nuts they can average 105 minutes of each prime time hour and up 
to 16 minutes of a daytime hour youd find instant relief in 
bahrain 
the authorities there keep them to a merciful fraction of what 
americans regularly facea good thing too the commercials on 
television in bahrain and saudi arabia are even more boring than 
those on us networks 
but the desert kind are shown only once or twice an evening 
three or four at a time during breaks between programs and even 
the most aggressive rug merchants do not advertise weekend 
warehouse sales 
for the returning expatriate the biggest change in american 
television is cable the explosion of channels devoted to sports 
movies documentaries on everything from the valdez oil spill to 
the sex life of the newt 
and of course theres news 24 hours a day on the cable news 
network 
so how else has american television changed well the hair of 
jr ewing has turned gray program credits flash by so fast that 
even a speedreader cant tell who did what theres a greater 
preoccupation with celebrities no matter how dubious their 
claims to fame 
in prime time there remains the old violence the bangbang 
but now theres a big difference in the dialogue the shows have 
real swear words in them 
the sex stuff continues although its much racier now and all 
the hugging necking and general messing around by the couples on 
tv here is initially strange to see 
it requires a bit of adjustment just to watch men and women 
embracing and kissing each other in the middle east islamic 
custom does not permit public displays of affection between the 
sexes 
such scenes are excised from programs before they are shown 
thus a man may be about to plant a long passionate kiss on his 
beloved when poof hes suddenly shooting a cannon or jumping 
up and down on a bad guy 
but finer fare is available bahrain and saudi stations choose 
from some of the best tv available from around the world viewers 
are able to see quality documentaries produced by the public 
broadcasting system and a steady flow of bbc programs on 
archaeology shakespeare and the arts 
what does the returnee from bahrain miss most watching american 
tv 
maybe the pomp and ritual of arab kings emirs and sheiks 
welcoming or saying goodbye to each other at airports and palaces 
shots that begin every newscast in the persian gulf 
tom brokaw peter jennings and dan rather may start their 
programs with graphics music and earthshaking news but none of 
it has the unique charm of saudi tvs announcement that the 
custodian of the two holy mosques king fahd bin abdul aziz today 
met with groups of citizens who came to greet him

what is the greatest contribution government can 
make to entrepreneurship 
keep out of the way and dont impede the work says william 
dunkelberg 
his response might seem flip but it isnt it is the considered 
judgment of an economist professor and business school dean who 
has spent many hours analyzing the needs of smallbusiness people 
dunkelberg head of temple universitys school of business and 
management also advises the national federation of independent 
business and in that role listens to hundreds of smallbusiness 
opinions each month 
what he sees and hears is that smallbusiness people have all 
they can do just to remain solvent not just because of competition 
but because of government to them government has become 
oppressive 
to dunkelberg one of the amazing things about these amazing 
people is that left to do their jobs they benefit everyone they 
provide jobs fill marketplace needs and pay taxes their efforts 
help support government 
in some respects government recognizes their efforts and 
strives to help them more often in dunkelbergs view it imposes 
burdens on them in the form of social programs and tax collectors 
jobs they arent trained to do 
firms especially small ones are not efficient administrators 
of social programs or tax collectors he says firms are best 
at producing goods and services 
when their time is diverted to paperwork managing health care 
programs running childcare operations providing health insurance 
and the like the less well they do at producing lowcost goods 
and services 
moreover the added expenses might lower profits and the 
incomes of those who work at the entrepreneurial enterprise 
thats almost everyone dunkelbergs figures indicate 90 percent 
of all employers in the united states have 20 or fewer employees 
making them fit almost any definition of small business 
he explains they do not have large pools of capital that they 
have no use for they are too small to efficiently deal with the 
high fixed costs entailed when interfacing with government 
regulations and programs 
operating in very competitive environments they must pass on 
all of the costs of the programs to their customers or shrink their 
operations 
dunkelbergs comments were provoked by what he sees as a 
legislative state of mind arising from the tightness of federal 
state and local budgets and which seeks to slough off on business 
what government cant afford itself 
its no answer he says conceivably it could even worsen 
matters by overburdening the small business 
from surveys dunkelberg has conducted come these findings 
when asked to compare the reality with expectations in starting 
a company half said they underestimated how difficult government 
regulations and red tape would be 
only 25 percent underestimated the problems associated with 
developing sales managing workers or financing operations 
a mere 10 percent or so said they underestimated the problems 
presented by the competition 
based on his findings dunkelberg has this message for state 
governments each law and regulation must be carefully examined 
for its tax consequences for entrepreneurship 
pressed by government requirements he says small businesses 
can seek greater efficiency raise prices cheapen the product cut 
the payroll or go out of business in all not a pleasant array of 
choices 
he points out that more positively government is in an 
excellent position to effectively develop 
a better infrastructure to lower commuting and transportation 
costs for example 
better workforce quality through education and training 
information and networking capabilities that make it easier for 
new firms to overcome the hurdles they face 
too often however businesses are viewed by government as a 
mechanism for new social programs or greater revenues dunkelberg 
says and with such a mindset it threatens the possibilities of 
both 
he concludes 
we can seriously damage the incentives faced by individuals 
who have the creative power not only to improve their own economic 
situation but also that of millions of others for whom these 
entrepreneurs create jobs and wealth

at dawn on april 25 1915 allied soldiers 
waded onto the gallipoli peninsula in an invasion that would cost 
hundreds of thousands of lives and end in failure 
seventyfive years later veterans of the campaign government 
oficials and tourists will come from as far as australia and new 
zealand for a commemoration some turks liken to a second invasion 
all hotels and boarding houses have been fully booked for 
months said muzaffer ecemis governor of canakkale province which 
includes the dardanelles strait and the peninsula north of it 
visiting dignitaries will be housed on a cruise ship they 
include prime minister margaret thatcher of britain the prime 
minister and defense minister of australia new zealands governor 
general and delegations from france and west germany 
two australian warships and a submarine set out from sydney 
france and britain also are sending two warships each with 
military bands and honor guards 
in world war i the ottoman turkish empire was allied with 
germany and austria against britain its dominions france and 
russia 
about 70 veterans of gallipoli aged 91 to 103 will be the most 
honored guests 
australian newspaper reports said one veteran john mccleery of 
perth planned to celebrate his 103rd birthday at anzac cove 
the place where australian and new zealand soldiers landed on his 
28th birthday 
the object of the gallipoli campaign which military historians 
call the first combined naval and land operation of modern warfare 
was to open the turkish straits to russia capture istanbul then 
known as constantinople in the west and take the ottoman empire 
out of the war 
an allied naval effort to break through the dardanelles the 
ancient hellespont had been halted after the loss of three 
battleships 
turks held their own victory celebrations march 18 to mark the 
end of that battle when they stopped the british navy from 
reaching the marmara sea 
gallipoli then became a battleground for nine months until the 
invading forces were evacuated in december 1915 and january 1916 
half a million soldiers from britain france australia new 
zealand and india fought on the peninsula and more than half became 
casualties including 55000 killed in battle 10000 listed as 
missing and 21000 who died of disease mainly dysentary 
an equal number of turks were sent into battle estimates are 
that half were killed 
historians still debate the mistakes made and opportunities 
missed by both sides 
some say an allied victory would have shortened the long costly 
war by two or three years and prevented or delayed the bolshevik 
revolution in russia 
it was the only victory for the turks in world war i and 
provided the selfconfidence they needed to salvage a nation from 
the dismembered empire 
the battle also gave them a modern hero kemal ataturk who made 
his name as a military genius in gallipoli he later established 
turkey a predominantly moslem country as a secular republic with 
westernstyle laws 
australians celebrate each april 25 as a national holiday 
gallipoli was their first appearance on the global scene and 
historians say it gave them a sense of pride and nationhood 
britain and france now are allied with turkey in nato and 
australia is a valued trading partner thousands of turks have 
emigrated to australia 
huseyin goseler a turk and jane urwin an australian will 
join the celebrations by getting married april 25 at an old 
fortress that overlooks the dardanelles from the hills of 
gallipoli they said in a telephone interview 
just in time to serve the visitors they and another australian 
have opened bobs burger pub named for bob hawke prime minister 
of australia

when the us supreme court was established 200 
years ago its powers under the constitution were only loosely 
defined so perhaps it was inevitable that the court would reflect 
the nations politics the social trends of the times heres a 
look at how that came about 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
of all the institutions that have shaped 
america over the two centuries since its birth shaped its 
political social and even its cultural face perhaps the most 
influential sculptor has been the us supreme court 
now the court goes into its third century pondering issues never 
dreamed of by the framers of the constitution ruling on such 
matters as burning the flag abortion and affirmative action 
they are legal issues to be sure but they are also political 
and social issues 
the court in the words of one scholar has become a barometer 
of political and social change and in the words of historian 
samuel eliot morison the keystone in the federal arch 
it was perhaps unavoidable that the nations highest tribunal 
would reflect national politics 
in one of the first cases to be argued before the court 
attorney general edmund randolph said with this discussion 
though purely legal it will be impossible to prevent the world 
from blending political considerations 
randolph spoke his words on aug 11 1792 in the courts third 
year as the justices considered whether a state could be sued by 
an individual who lived in another state 
at that time the court had five justices who held court in the 
philadelphia city hall now the court which observed the 200th 
anniversary of its first sitting on feb 1 has nine justices it 
meets in a threestory marble building on capitol hill 
without question it has a mystique about it 
most people have a sort of a reverent eye about the supreme 
court says civil rights attorney william m kunstler a harsh 
critic of the institution they go into that building with the 
carpets and the columns and the aweinspiring aspect of it and 
they say oh my god its the fount of all knowledge 
hollywood has mirrored this view in the 1942 comedy the talk 
of the town ronald colman plays a smalltown lawyer who is named 
to a seat on the high court every time the subject comes up 
massed violins strike up a soaring melody 
richard nixon running against democrat hubert humphrey in 1968 
campaigned against the mystique as he promised to nominate 
lawandorder justices if elected president 
whenever i begin to discuss the supreme court mr humphrey 
acts like were in church nixon complained 
more recently president reagan charged liberals with 
politicizing the court in their successful battle against his 
nomination of conservative robert h bork to its bench in 1987 
many jurists scholars and lawyers however say that whatever 
the issue whatever the setting the court cannot get away from 
political currents 
the supreme court has never been above politics says 
historian frank freidel professor emeritus at harvard and the 
university of washington 
i think the court inevitably reflects the social and political 
trends of the age we live in says ae howard professor of law 
at the university of virginia and a supreme court authority much 
of what the court does is a barometer of political and social 
change 
it is totally political says kunstler to pretend it is 
not is to delude the american people 
the turnofthe century humorist finley peter dunne speaking 
through his irish immigrant character mr dooley put the sentiment 
into dialect saying th supreme coort follows th iliction 
returns 
even chief justice william h rehnquist in a 1986 speech at 
suffolk university school of law said judges so long as they 
are relatively normal human beings can no more escape being 
influenced by public opinion in the long run than can people 
working at other jobs 
the constitution merely says the judicial power of the united 
states shall be vested in one supreme court and in such inferior 
courts as congress may from time to time ordain and establish 
the constitution says little about the supreme courts powers 
only that it will hear appeals and will have original jurisdiction 
over some limited categories of cases it does not say how many 
justices there should be congress set the number at six then 
changed it to five six again seven nine seven again and then 
nine again 
in its early days the court was by no means the prestigious 
institution it later became george washington recruiting 
potential nominees for the new tribunal got several turndowns 
john jay the first chief justice resigned to run for governor of 
new york others also left to take other jobs 
after the appointment of chief justice john marshall in 1801 
the court loomed larger it is the bust of the third chief justice 
not jays that is on the bicentennial postage stamp it is also 
his name that is associated with the courts first great milestone 
the power of the supreme court to strike down laws by ruling 
they are unconstitutional is so much a part of american life that 
it is easy to forget it was not always taken for granted the 
constitution says nothing about it george washington believed the 
president would exercise this power through his veto but as it 
turned out presidents used the veto as an instrument of policy 
instead 
then president john adams tried to make one william marbury a 
midnight judge by giving him a justice of the peace appointment 
just before leaving office 
in 1803 marshall writing for a unanimous court struck down 
the law under which marbury sued to force the new jefferson 
administration to honor the appointment there would be no reason 
to have the powers of congress limited in the constitution if 
these limits may at any time be passed the chief justice said 
he said it was up to the courts to say what the law is marbury 
never got to be a justice of the peace 
the court did not again rule a law unconstitutional for more 
than half a century but when it did it added fuel to the 
smoldering controversy that would blaze into civil war 
dred scott was the black slave of an army surgeons widow in st 
louis and missouri was a slave state before the surgeon died 
however he had taken scott with him to army posts in illinois and 
what is now minnesota scott sued for his freedom on grounds he had 
lived for years in a free state and territory he lost in missouri 
courts and in a federal circuit court then the case went to the 
supreme court which had a southern majority and was headed by 
proslavery chief justice roger b taney

<TEXT>
in 1857 the court ruled that congress had exceeded its 
constitutional powers in adopting the missouri compromise 
prohibiting slavery in some territories scott was freed by his 
owner anyway but died of consumption a year later 
the court was so vilified in the north that a later chief 
justice charles evans hughes described the ruling as a 
selfinflicted wound 
abraham lincoln taking office as president in 1861 
acknowledged that the rulings of the court were entitled to very 
high respect and consideration but added that if the policy of 
the government upon vital questions affecting the whole people is 
to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the supreme court the 
instant they are made in ordinary litigation between parties to 
personal actions the people will have ceased to be their own 
rulers 
despite lincolns words the court continued to decide ordinary 
litigation between parties and in the process set national policy 
most presidents at one time or another have made some 
statement like that howard says whenever the executive branch 
has been threatened by the court they immediately invoke 
democracy 
take andrew jackson 
the marshall court ruled in 1832 that two missionaries had been 
wrongly convicted and imprisoned by the state of georgia for living 
among the cherokee indians 
john marshall has made his decision now let him enforce it 
said president jackson 
marshall could do no such thing and the missionaries languished 
in prison for years 
in the federalist papers alexander hamilton wrote that the 
judiciary has no influence over either the sword or the purse 
it may truly be said to have neither force nor will but merely 
judgment 
merely judgment 
a judgment in 1896 that separate railroad cars for blacks were 
not discriminatory as long as the facilities were equal 
establishing a standard for treatment of the races that stood for 
more than half a century 
a judgment in 1905 that laws limiting the work week for men 
were mere meddlesome interferences with the rights of the 
individual a standard that would give way as the court later 
approved wageandhour laws 
a judgment in 1952 that president truman exceeded his authority 
in seizing struck steel mills 
a judgment in 1954 outlawing school segregation ruling that 
the separatebutequal doctrine had no place in public education 
a judgment in 1973 striking down restrictive abortion laws in 
46 states 
a judgment in 1974 that president nixon must surrender 
watergate tapes sought by a special prosecutor 
a judgment in 1989 striking down a law against desecrating the 
american flag 
we have seen a shift from structural questions like federalism 
to social issues like abortion howard says i think the court 
has registered another significant political change and that is the 
vast sweep of government the more government does the more 
opportunities there are for people to complain 
in the 1930s president franklin roosevelt frustrated by a 
string of decisions striking down new deal programs sought 
legislation enabling him to pack the supreme court by appointing a 
new judge for every one who reached age 70 it was his most 
stunning defeat 
it made him look like a dictator says freidel author of a 
new onevolume biography franklin d roosevelt a rendezvous 
with destiny and an earlier fourvolume study of roosevelt 
that was a terrible thing to look like in 1937 with hitler and 
mussolini rampant in europe 
as it turned out the courtpacking plan was unnecessary 
between 1937 and 1940 resignations created five vacancies and fdr 
had a roosevelt court that upheld new deal legislation 
president eisenhowers appointment of earl warren as chief 
justice in 1953 ushered in an era of judicial activism including 
the school desegregation decisions the 1963 ruling against 
mandatory prayer in public schools a ruling the same year that all 
criminal defendants must have counsel and the one man one 
vote rule on congressional reapportionment in 1964 
all governments including supreme courts are influenced 
directly by whats happening in the streets of the country says 
civil libertarian kunstler during the warren era you had the 
pressures that came from the streets of birmingham and other 
places martin luther king and so on that forced the court to do 
right 
president nixons appointment of warren burger as chief justice 
in 1969 and his subsequent naming of three associate justices 
ushered in a more conservative era that has continued under 
rehnquist 
in decisions this year the court has ruled that prison 
officials may force mentally ill inmates to take antipsychotic 
drugs has broadened the power of police to conduct searches after 
making arrests in private homes and has upheld a type of death 
penalty law in effect in 14 states 
i regard the supreme court as an enemy not a friend and i 
think it has to be treated as an enemy now says kunstler who 
has argued the flag burning case among others in the high court 
it should be picketed it should be attacked in every way 
possible because it is not a harbinger of good will and human 
rights and equal rights and liberties for all 
howard however thinks the panel does a pretty good job of 
living up to the motto over its front door equal justice under 
law 
i think by and large it does he said in an interview i 
suspect it is a more evenhanded court than it might have been in an 
earlier age 
of the present members of the court william j brennan was 
appointed by eisenhower byron white by john f kennedy thurgood 
marshall by lyndon johnson rehnquist and harry blackmun by nixon 
john paul stevens by gerald ford and sandra day oconnor antonin 
scalia and anthony kennedy by reagan reagan elevated rehnquist to 
chief justice 
eight of the last 29 justices had political careers before going 
on the bench but the trend in recent years has been to nominate 
people with judicial experience seven of the present nine 
justices all but rehnquist and white were judges on lower 
appellate courts when appointed 
howard said he found this troublesome 
i think when hugo black came from the senate and william o 
douglas from the securities and exchange commission and earl warren 
from california politics they brought a dimension that an 
appellate judge simply does not the virginia law professor said 
i would like some of the nine to have been judges but not all 
nine 
i think it should be political in the broad sense it is a 
place where policy is made for better or worse and therefore it 
should be tested by how people feel about it but it ought not to 
be political in immediate or partisan terms i think it is proper 
that once a justice is on the court he is frequently an ingrate to 
the president who put him there

hugo l black had the rare privilege of 
speaking for the supreme court on march 18 1963 when it 
unanimously reversed itself and decided he had been right all along 
twentyone years earlier black had led a band of three 
dissenters as the court ruled the constitution did not require 
states to provide counsel for criminal defendants who were too poor 
to hire their own lawyers 
now the court was considering the case of clarence earl gideon 
convicted in a florida court of breaking into a poolroom he was 
sentenced to five years in prison 
gideon told the judge he was entitled to a lawyer the judge and 
the florida supreme court both turned him down 
the situation said black was strikingly like the 1942 
case in which an unemployed maryland farmhand denied a lawyer 
was convicted of robbery 
in that case the high court ruled the appointment of counsel 
was not a fundamental right essential to a fair trial 
now with all of his colleagues on his side blacks decision 
ruled that gideon was indeed entitled to a lawyer 
the right of one charged with crime to counsel may not be 
deemed fundamental and essential to fair trials in some countries 
but it is in ours he said 
blacks triumph was a dramatic demonstration of the power of 
dissent a power that often has seen the minority opinion become 
the majority opinion as time passes 
one of the most famous dissents in the courts history was that 
of john marshall harlan in a louisiana railroad case in 1896 that 
established the rule of separate but equal facilities for the 
races 
our constitution is colorblind and neither knows nor 
tolerates classes among citizens harlan said in respect of 
civil rights all citizens are equal before the law 
he was the lone dissenter 
in 1954 however the court unanimously ruled the separate but 
equal doctrine was unconstitutional discrimination against black 
children because separate education facilities are inherently 
unequal 
often more than one justice files a dissenting opinion in the 
courts 1986 term for example there were 156 dissents exactly 
the number of cases the court decided on the merits although 41 of 
the courts decisions were unanimous 
most of the dissents attract little attention in some of the 
more famous ones 
justice louis d brandeis pioneered the theory now widely 
accepted of a constitutional right to privacy 
justice oliver wendell holmes jr warned against attempts to 
check the expression of opinions that we loathe and believe to be 
fraught with death 
justice william o douglas inveighed against loyaltysecurity 
hearings in which faceless people are allowed to present their 
whispered rumors and yet escape the test and torture of 
crossexamination 
chief justice charles evans hughes summed up the case for the 
dissenters this way 
a dissent in a court of last resort is an appeal to the 
brooding spirit of the law to the intelligence of a future day 
when a later decision may possibly correct the error into which the 
dissenting judge believes the court to have been betrayed

spanishspeaking puerto rico at least in cultural terms as a 
separate and older country than the united states 
puerto rico was already a country with grecoroman roots two 
centuries before the united states he says 
still the other puerto rico exists alongside the caribbean 
islands helterskelter commercial development widespread poverty 
and high levels of drugrelated crime and aids among 33 million 
people crowded onto an area only 100 miles long by 35 miles wide 
moreover the islands image is blurred by west side story 
stereotypes of the 25 million puerto ricans living in the 
crumbling urban barrios of the united states 
west side story was a beautiful musical but a very bad thing 
for puerto rico because it gave the wrong impression of puerto 
rico says former gov luis ferre the 86yearold father of 
puerto ricos statehood movement and multimillionaire benefactor of 
the impressive ponce museum of art in the southern coastal city of 
ponce his birthplace 
with the island planning a plebiscite in 1991 on whether to 
remain a us commonwealth form an independent nation or become 
the 51st state some feel prejudices against puerto ricans could 
dampen any enthusiasm for statehood in the us congress 
sure its a problem for us says former gov carlos romero 
barcelo leader of the prostatehood new progressive party its 
a problem for mississippi the image the nation has of 
mississippi 
he says polls have shown twothirds of americans would be 
willing to accept puerto rico as a state if the island favored it 
but if puerto ricans wanted independence 80 percent say they would 
accept that 
theres an underlying prejudice somewhere there he says 
puerto ricans of course have distinguished themselves in many 
fields in the united states singer jose feliciano film stars

christopher columbus discovered 
puerto rico on nov 14 1493 at the time the caribbean island was 
inhabited by aboriginal taino indians who called their land 
borinquen 
columbus companion juan ponce de leon seeker of the mythical 
fountain of perpetual youth established the first spanish 
settlement near san juan harbor in 1508 
spain imported african slaves to work sugar plantations and used 
puerto rico as a way station for goldladen ships from mexico to 
stock up on provisions before continuing their voyage to spain 
in 1898 spain ceded puerto rico along with guam and the 
philippines to the united states at the end of the 
spanishamerican war which was fought to liberate cuba from 
spanish rule 
puerto ricans became us citizens in 1917 and elected a 
governor for the first time in 1948 
the island became a us commonwealth in 1952 the status 
ratified by referendum in 1967 gives puerto ricans most rights and 
benefits of citizenship but they pay no federal taxes and cannot 
vote for us president puerto rico is represented in congress by 
one nonvoting delegate 
congress is now considering the islands proposal for a 
plebiscite in june 1991 on whether to remain a commonwealth with 
increased autonomy form an independent nation or become the 51st 
state 
puerto ricos relationship with the united states has been 
marred by occasional proindependence violence

as dinosaurs go they were the biggest of the 
big they lived in a region that is now the rocky mountains no 
dwarfs themselves when it comes to hills and its in those 
mountains that their bones are interred offering todays 
scientists valuable clues to the history of life 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
for more than a century scientists have been 
digging into a vast dinosaur graveyard in the rocky mountains 
unraveling the mysteries of the largest creatures ever to roam the 
planet 
here lie the fossilized bones of dinosaurs that lived 140 
million years ago when the front range was a great semiarid 
lowland with periods of rain and drought colorado was a flat 
landscape with large meandering streams vegetation and open spaces 
man was still 138 million years away 
called the morrison formation for a small town southwest of 
denver where the first dinosaur skeleton was found here in 1877 
the graveyard lies on either side of the rocky mountains from idaho 
south to new mexico 
paleontologists call it the capital of dinosaur research 
in january a colorado expedition found a jaw and vertebrae 
fragments west of fort collins that belonged to the rare 
meatgulping hunter epanterias 
robert bakker a university of colorado paleontologist who led 
that team says people werent interested in dinosaurs before the 
1877 discovery because they didnt know much about them he said 
that before the colorado find there were miserable fragments of 
fossils from europe 
the morrison finds really put american science on the map and 
continues to surprise us every field season says bakker who has 
been working on the formation since 1974 
a group of preservationminded people in colorado has organized 
friends of dinosaur ridge and is working with local and state 
officials on a project to protect a famous morrison formation 
outcropping southwest of denver 
the group has proposed a park a mile long and 200 feet wide it 
would lie on the first ridge a hogback west of lakewood 
colo a denver suburb if the proposal is approved colorado 
highway 26 would be closed from rooney road to colorado 93 
joe tempel environmental manager for the state highway 
department described the proposed dinosaur ridge park as an 
outdoor education laboratory a handson science ecology 
natural history park 
the most extensive collection of morrison dinosaur fossils are 
housed in the carnegie museum of natural history in pittsburgh 
the morrison gives us the best picture of the really big 
dinosaurs that lived in the age of dinosaurs says david burman 
curator of vertebrae fossils at the carnegie because of the 
nature of the environment it represented it has preserved more and 
better specimens of any formation in any period 
scientists credit the rocky mountains with allowing them to 
study the dinosaur fossils as the earths crust rose and 
contorted erosion exposed layers of sandstone limestone and 
shale the layers display the fossilized bones footprints and 
environment of the jurassic period 
the jurassic a time from 205 million years to 130 million years 
ago is considered the second geological period in the age of 
dinosaurs the morrison formation appeared in the upper jurassic 
period 140 million years ago when the dinosaurs were at their 
largest 
the morrison formation is part of one of the most complete 
records of the history of life you can find says dr richard 
stucky paleontologist at the denver museum of natural history 
there are episodes missing in the rocky mountains but we do have 
a fairly complete record 
in 1877 the dinosaur graveyard was discovered by visiting 
scientists who found an apatosaurus and a stegosaurus near 
morrison that find was quickly followed by the discovery of an 
allosaurus and a camarasaurus north of canon city and dozens of 
dinosaurs north of laramie wyo those discoveries kicked off a 
kind of fossil gold rush that continues today 
there are dozens of theories about the mysterious mass 
extinction of dinosaurs at the end of the mesozoic era among them 
are movements of the earth starvation parasites poisons changes 
in the climate meteorites and even extraterrestrial hunters 
bakker believes dinosaurs became extinct because of worldwide 
diseases that turned into an eptimological nightmare 
dinosaurs didnt go out with a bang they went out with 
worldwide diarrhea he says 
big animals travel and are very vulnerable to disease bakker 
says as land bridges formed throughout the globe the animals 
would move spreading all the hundreds of diseases throughout all 
the herds on all continents eventually killing the lot 
most of the carnegie collection of fossils came from what is now 
dinosaur national monument on the northwestern coloradoutah 
border in moffat county colo scientists took 750000 pounds of 
crated dinosaurs from the quarries 
the expedition brought the best apatosaurus a topnotch 
diplodocus a teenage camarasaurus and the most complete 
sauropod burman says 
the first dinosaur at the museum was the diplodocus found at 
sheep creek wyo which burman says is one of the most famous in 
the world plaster casts have been made and shipped to germany 
france argentina spain and portugal 
one of the first plaster casts was shipped to the british 
museum at a time when these big fossils were relatively new so 
they created quite a stir in europe burman says newspapers 
carried headlines that read dippy comes to england 
the original diplodocus is still in the carnegie museum but 
pittsburgh is not the only place to see such giants 
in terms of seeing big dinosaurs before your eyes you wont 
see anything like the morrison formation in the world burman 
says it gives people a look at how the dinosaurs occur in the 
rock

fossils of some of the dinosaurs that have been 
found in the morrison formation include 
apatosaurus popularly known as the brontosaurus one of the 
bestknown dinosaurs the 70footlong creature had a heavy body 
and legs and a long neck and tail 
diplodocus ninety feet long with most of the length from the 
long thin neck and long whiplike tail its name which means 
double beam describes a special feature of the backbone a 
piece of small bone that pointed forward as well as the normal 
piece that pointed back 
stegosaurus had a tiny tubular skull with a brain the size of 
a walnut it had small flat plates on its neck and bigger 
diamondshaped plates on its back and the first part of its tail 
it grew up to 30 feet long 
allosaurus the largest carnivore in north america in the late 
jurassic period it may have fed on other wellknown dinosaurs it 
was different from other meateating dinosaurs in the shape of its 
skull which had a ridge along the top that ran from between the 
eyes to the tip of the snout it was 35 feet long 
camarasaurus a heavily built suaropod with a shorter tail and 
neck than the apatosaurus or diplodocus its head was short with a 
blunt snout and its nostrils were on the top of its head those 
features have led scientists to believe it could have lived in 
water it generally grew to 60 feet long

the tombstones tell the story a litany of all 
of americas wars and the men who fought in them its not so large 
as arlington national cemetery but the small burial ground at the 
west point military academy is unmatched in its historical scope 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a small cemetery overlooking the hudson 
river is hallowed ground for americas fighting men 
the modest us military academys post cemetery is probably the 
only burial ground that holds the graves of soldiers who fought in 
every war from the revolution to vietnam 
there are soldiers buried here who were killed by arrows musket 
balls viet cong ambush and space capsule fires fifteen are medal 
of honor winners 
the 420acre 60000grave arlington national cemetery may be 
more expansive and the battlefield cemetery at gettysburg may 
reflect the terrible toll of a single battle 
but there is unmatched history and glory preserved in the 
14acre west point cemetery where american soldiers were being 
buried 82 years before the first soldier was interred at arlington 
james m gavin a famed and muchdecorated world war ii general 
was the most recent war hero to be buried here 
gavin who led american paratroopers in the dday invasion of 
normandy the battle of the bulge and aerial attacks on naziheld 
holland was buried in late february with full military honors 
including an honor guard from his old outfit the 82nd airborne 
division 
gavin lies alongside such american soldiers as george armstrong 
custer the legendary indian fighter killed on june 25 1876 along 
with 200 soldiers of the 7th cavalry in the battle of the little 
big horn gen winfield scott hero from the war of 1812 and the 
commander of union forces at the opening of the civil war robert 
anderson who defended fort sumter in the opening battle of the 
civil war and astronaut edward white the first american to walk 
in space who died during a flash fire aboard the apollo i space 
capsule 
certainly its got to be the most varied and comprehensive 
military cemetery in the nation says stephen grove the academy 
historian with unknown soldiers from the revolution and people 
like gavin and custer it has tremendous variety and diversity 
outside of arlington it has the most distinguished collection 
of military people in the united states in one spot it has 
tremendous solemnness walking through the cemetery is like going 
through pages of history you come across name after name of people 
youve read about 
the oldest grave at the cemetery belongs to dominick trant a 
revolutionary war soldier who died at the fort in 1782 
during the revolutionary war west point was a crucial outpost 
because it controlled traffic on the hudson river north of new york 
city george washington warned that the british could split the 
colonies and win the war quickly if they captured west point it 
was west point that benedict arnold plotted to turn over to the 
british when he betrayed the american cause 
with all its history and tradition being buried at west point 
is a high honor for officers who graduated from the military 
academy gavin who called west point his spartan mother chose 
the post cemetery over arlington as his burial place 
i think most of the family would have preferred that he be 
buried at arlington but it was always his desire to be buried at 
west point says gavins nephew col barrie e zais who also 
graduated from the military academy he was very close to west 
point 
burial is limited to west point graduates soldiers serving at 
the academy post at the time of their death and their immediate 
family members

what has become of the social hall henry 
gruene built a century ago well the antique building now 
restored is where the girl scouts meet by day but at night it 
becomes a beer joint where a new generation of country musicians 
strut their stuff to stardom and the joint is jumping 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
by day this is a quiet little town 
overlooking the rocky guadalupe river travelers hunt for antiques 
eat barbecued brisket and laze around sipping cool drinks 
after dark is when the place comes alive and you have to think 
old henry gruene would approve 
after dark local regulars and the curious from the big city 
crowd into a centuryold saloon gruene hall sipping beer from 
longneck bottles and beating the boards to the sounds of the 
fabulous thunderbirds jerry jeff walker bo diddley and other 
bignames familiar to country music fans 
a lot of great sweaty nights happen here says 
singersongwriter hal ketchum leaning back in an old chair near 
the halls bar theres nothing like a good 105degree day in 
here with your band 
by day gruene hall is a meeting spot for girl scouts and 
debutantes but when the sun goes down it has become one of texas 
hippest honkytonks its pictured on album covers and serves as 
folksy stage set for videos and television specials 
like the music shrines of nashville gruene hall attracts 
thousands of music fans to this little village a historic district 
that has remained a community unto itself despite being 
incorporated into new braunfels a town of 22000 people a few 
miles up the road from san antonio 
henry gruene pronounced green for whom the town was named 
built the hall in the 1870s as a social center local farmers came 
to the hall to weigh their cotton before delivering it to the gin 
next door and on saturday nights brought their families there to 
dance bedding down their children next to the walls on the 
original hardwood floor 
the old woodburning stove remains as do decorative signs 
dating to the 1920s 
the hall and several other gruene buildings are owned by jane 
nalley of new braunfels and pat molak of san antonio molak bought 
the hall and reopened it 15 years ago after it had been in disuse 
for several decades 
it long has been a favorite haunt of countryandwestern blues 
rock and folk musicians and in the last few years gained some 
national renown 
country music connoisseurs will recognize the names george 
strait and june carter cash strait played here about once a month 
for six years before he became a star he returned in january to 
tape commercials promoting a tour 
june carter cash johnny cashs wife arrived in january with 
her three sisters to film a documentary about their musician 
mother maybelle carter 
despite gruene halls newfound glory owners molak and nalley 
keep it a laidback place no advance ticket sales no dressing 
rooms for the musicians no matter how big theyve become 
truth is gruene hall is a beer joint or as molak calls it a 
dive and a goodsized dive at that about 500 people crowd inside 
to dance and listen to a live perforsmance 
they have good concerts i know that for a town this small 
its amazing how they attract bigname people in here says john 
graves a 23yearold student at southwest texas state university 
in nearby san marcos who likes to hang out at gruene hall to shoot 
pool 
country singer and recent grammy winner rodney crowell heard 
about gruene hall and called one time wanting to play here ms 
nalley says 
another grammy winner lyle lovett also played the hall as 
have michael murphy delbert mcclinton gary p nunn and dozens of 
others whose pictures dot the walls near the bar 
hal ketchum 37 hopes to one day count himself among the famous 
who got their start in gruene hall where he was given his first 
chance to play one of his own songs in public now he and a 
fivepiece dance band play there about six times a year 
gruene hall he says was his music school a place where he was 
able to hear some of the greats

its no secret that railroads have been dying 
like elms for a generation whats so alarming then when one more 
faces bankruptcy it happens that the one on its deathbed today was 
the nations first railroad and what would end with it is a 
romantic chapter of american folklore 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
as a boy back in the 1920s dick williams 
spent his happiest hours down at the railroad yard with his father 
a dispatcher 
in those days railroads were in their heyday already a legend 
of american expansion and industry in young williams view no 
occupation could be more romantic or more necessary than 
railroading 
or more permanent because the railroad where his father worked 
and which he later served for 40 years was the delaware amp hudson 
railroad co the venerable damph the nations oldest railroad it 
made its first run in 1829 
it might make its last run any day now 
if no one buys the damph in the next few weeks men will unhook 
its cars and sell them off one by one dick williams always felt he 
would be long dead before such a historical ignominy would ever 
come to pass 
its hard to see this happening to a railroad you worked on 
your entire life says williams williams who is 61 took early 
retirement six years ago because he couldnt bear to stick around 
and listen to the death rattle 
if no buyer comes forward more than 400 workers who make sure 
the damph keeps its schedule on runs between montreal and washington 
and between albany and buffalo would lose their jobs america would 
lose a chapter of its folklore 
the delaware amp hudson didnt start out as a railroad 
in 1823 brothers william and maurice wurtz merchants from 
philadelphia carved out a canal from northern pennsylvania to 
kingston ny to haul coal 
six years later the brothers began using a new technology called 
a gravity line stationary steam engines hauled cable cars up 
the hills gravity took them down and horses pulled them in 
between 
damph began using steam locomotives in 1860 and gradually expanded 
into the northeast and canada 
during the civil war the damph hauled coal to northern arsenals 
in 1885 a damph train carried the body of gen ulysses s grant for 
a final viewing before the former president was buried in new york 
in the next century american soldiers made part of their journey 
south aboard the damph to fight the mexican bandit pancho villa 
before the start of world war ii winston churchill rode the damph 
into canada after a stop in washington to ask congress for money to 
fight hitlers germany 
in those days more than 250000 miles of railroad track 
crisscrossed america and dick williams as a telegraph operator 
and train dispatcher as his father before him watched it all and 
marveled 
today his albany home is a museum of damph memorabilia including 
an old telegraph bug his father gave him when he was 12 years 
old he can still tap out words still remembers morse code 30 
years after the damph stopped using telegraphs 
williams moved on from telegraph operator to dispatcher and then 
fireman and eventually worked his way up to general manager in 1980 
railroad men were a breed all by themselves he said 
reflecting on those glory days of railroading theyd do anything 
for one another it was like a family you felt good accomplishing 
what you were supposed to do you took pride in your work 
railroad business began declining in the 1950s with the growth 
of the interstate highway system and the trucking industry 
trucks had a highway system that was free to them railroads 
had to own the property they ran over and in most cases had to pay 
taxes on that property william says 
by the 1970s mergers and acquisitions were commonplace as 
railroads struggled to stay alive the federal government got 
involved and the result was conrail an amalgamation of the penn 
central new jersey central reading erie lackawanna and several 
smaller railroads that were either bankrupt or about to be 
conrail was supposed to provide damph with friendly connections 
cut off by the mergers of several railway companies surrounding 
damph federal officials said they said it also would allow damph to 
extend into buffalo and as far south as washington and remain 
competitive with the federally subsidized conrail 
while williams agrees some federal action was necessary to save 
the railroad industry in the northeast he says what was done did 
little to help damph damph had to use conrail track to haul freight to 
its new destinations at a price set by conrail that price wasnt 
competitive williams says 
we had an opportunity to provide some competition and we 
attempted to have a profitable operation but it didnt work he 
says but you had to try or you were dead conrail was a blood 
transfusion for damph thats all 
damph struggled to remain solvent propped up by state and federal 
money from the late 1970s to the early 1980s damph received almost 
40 million in federal aid 
by the 1980s damph was one of the northeasts last major 
privately owned railroads but it was losing money 14 million in 
1982 
hope of continued survival came in 1984 in the form of guilford 
transportation industries of billerica mass guilford owner 
timothy mellon a financier and descendant of the pittsburgh 
banking family bought damph to complete a northeast rail network 
made up of the guilfordowned maine central and boston amp maine 
railroads 
the buyout created a system stretching from new england to 
buffalo with legs north to montreal and south to baltimore and 
washington it was an attempt to compete with conrail in the 
northeast 
however negotiations with damph employees to change labor 
contracts faltered four years after it purchased damph guilford put 
it into bankruptcy 
guilford officials blame the railroads demise on damphs archaic 
union work rules damph employees williams says blamed guilfords 
inexperience in running a railroad 
the fate of the damph now rests with a washington lawyer francis 
dicello appointed trustee in 1988 by a federal bankruptcy court 
dicello says he will try to find a buyer for the line within the 
next few weeks if that fails he may ask the courts permission to 
liquidate 
damph president carl belke insists the railroad will survive 
we intend to be here one way or another he says

christopher reeve says his latest television 
movie the rose and the jackal relies on imagination to fill 
in blank pages in one episode of the civil war 
the movie which premieres monday on turner network television 
pits two historical figures against each other in a story of love 
and honor 
we take two historical figures in washington on opposite 
sides in the war and imagine what their relationship might have 
been reeve says 
reeve stars as allan pinkerton the private detective who 
founded the secret service and had the duty of stopping the flow of 
military secrets to the south 
madolyn smith osborne is rose oneal greenhow a beautiful and 
aristocratic southerner who operated a confederate spy ring out of 
her georgetown mansion she was known as the merry widow of 
washington and one senator said she had incomparable seductive 
powers it was rumored she had an affair with president james 
buchanan 
pinkerton had her under surveillance and then under house 
arrest and finally sent her to the old capitol prison reeve 
says what the movie imagines is that he developed an obsession 
with her the story deals with his attempts to break her and make 
her sign a loyalty oath to the union and her standing firm in her 
beliefs 
these are two passionate individuals fighting for what they 
believe in 
this production began as a historical footnote that writer eric 
edson spotted in margaret leechs reveille in washington it 
mentioned the names of pinkerton and greenhow and inspired edsons 
screenplay he wrote it originally as a theatrical film but even 
with a wellknown actress set for the role of greenhow no studio 
would make it six years later it was accepted by tnt 
the role is a real change of pace for reeve who is best known 
as the man of steel in superman in this historical drama he 
wears a beard has a scottish accent and is an obsessive and 
selfrighteous man 
the story focuses on the class distinctions between pinkerton 
and greenhow reeve says 
pinkerton was a working class scottish immigrant he says 
rose greenhow was a southern aristocrat pinkerton was a private 
detective a gumshoe 
she was the southern rose he was the jackal who pursued her 
until he finally devoured her 
one event our film covers is that she was tipped off on when 
union troops would move on bull run and she got word to general 
beauregard the union lost the first battle of bull run it was a 
very high priority in washington to neutralize her 
pinkerton was very protective of abraham lincoln and foiled a 
plot in baltimore to kill him prior to his first inauguration 
pinkerton was out of his element however as a military analyst 
he underestimated confederate strength at antietam and helped cause 
another defeat by 1863 he had retreated to chicago and gone back 
into private practice 
jack gold directed the rose and the jackal which was filmed 
on location in georgia savannah macon atlanta and stone 
mountain 
we used the same civil war reenacters who were in glory 
reeve says they know all the battles and all the details 
reeve moves between roles in movies television and the theater 
besides the four superman movies he was in switching 
channels street smart deathtrap somewhere in time 
and the bostonians he starred in anna karenina and the 
great escape ii the untold story for television 
reeve is not sure there will be any more superman movies 
if there is another its time to recast he says im 
getting too old to play him again superman is perennially 30 
years old you cant have an aging superman but it has less to 
do with age than the fact that i was pretty disappointed in the 
last picture 
reeve lives on a 40acre farm near williamstown mass where he 
frequently appears at the williamstown theater festival the 
massachusetts home base allows him to indulge in his passion for 
skiing and sailing 
last year he had built a 46foot sloop called the sea angel 
these interests are as satisfying to me as acting he says

well i was bowled over right then and there i fell in love 
with charles macarthur the most beautiful most amusing most 
amazing and dazzling man i had ever met 
charlie never lived that remark down miss hayes says in an 
interview on our 25th wedding anniversary we went to 21 
charlie loved that restaurant it was his hangout and on our 
table they had a bowl of salted peanuts dyed green 
everyone kept reminding me that charlie still had a wife 
though they had been separated for years and that i was a 
catholic marrying charlie meant excommunication so to me it is 
still astonishing that i never hesitated that from the start i was 
prepared to rebel against mother and mother church and anyone else 
who tried to come between us she writes 
charlie she writes could not bear to take a wife better known 
than he a constant thorn as miss hayes remained better known 
when the front page opened charlie and his coauthor ben 
hecht fled to the fire escape shortly after the curtain went up 
a few minutes into the first act i knew we were in percy 
hammond the tribune critic was chuckling and pounding his 
companion on the back charlie chaplins eyes were rolling the 
audience was breaking up with laughter 
i ran to the fire escape and shouted its a hit whereupon 
charlie opened his arms and asked will you marry me helen 
it was a marriage planned by god she says despite its 
rocky times mostly caused by macarthurs love of the bottle 
until mary died the drinking was only sporadic but then charlie 
set about killing himself it took seven years and it was 
harrowing to watch she writes 
miss hayes does not care for any of the movies she made after 
the tv movie murder with mirrors the producer called to tell 
her 20 million people had watched it 
i found that i felt depressed she writes twenty million 
people the total audience i had reached in 80 years in the theater 
all those plays all those beautiful lines all that shared 
intimacy with live patrons amounted to a tiny fraction of the 
number of people who had watched me the night before in a mediocre 
tv show 
miss hayes writes hilariously about her encounters with royalty 
her mother had lectured her never to speak to celebrities unless 
they spoke to you 
she tells of her meeting the grand duchess marie of russia who 
had a job promoting machiavellis perfume at bergdorfs 
when marie came into my dressing room she sat down on the 
sofa and gave me a bottle of perfume miss hayes writes before 
i could stop myself my first utterance was is your serene 
highness still working at machiavellis perfume counter 
then there was an afternoon ferry boat ride with beatrice lillie 
to blackwells island in the east river home to a hospital for the 
mentally ill after strolling around lunching on hot dogs ice 
cream and lemonade they decided to leave bea lillie in private 
life was lady peel married to a member of the british peerage and 
capable of pulling that rank when needed 
at the ferry a guard asked for their passes 
my dear sir bea replied in her toniest lady peel voice i 
am beatrice lillie and this is helen hayes we both have 
performances to give tonight and we have to get to our theaters 
 
the guard was unmoved then she added in her best british 
accent i am lady peel miss hayes is the first lady of the 
american theater and this gentleman is the distinguished 
playwright mr charles macarthur 
the guard sighed wearily listen lady were already got 
some lillies here and several first ladies and maybe a couple of 
macarthurs too so show me a pass or get back to the hospital and 
take tea with greta garbo and lady astor there are a few of them 
too roaming around

americans crossing the atlantic this year can get 
a real feeling of what it was like in southern england when britain 
stood alone against the luftwaffe 50 years ago 
it was world war ii leader sir winston churchill who named the 
struggle the battle of britain even before it began 
as it was being fought in the summer of 1940 he said of the few 
hundred royal air force pilots from 19 nations who clashed headon 
with hordes of german bombers and their protecting screens of 
fighters never in the field of human conflict was so much owed 
by so many to so few 
from april to october this year exhibitions and air displays 
will recall that summer when the hurricanes and spitfires met the 
enemy air fleets pouring in from airfields in newly conquered 
northeast france 
the biggest ground effort marking the 50th anniversary of the 
four months combat in the sky is the battle of britain 
experience at the royal air force museum april 11oct 31 
the museum at historic hendon airfield in north london can be 
reached from colindale underground station northern line or mill 
hill train station buses will shuttle from the two stations to the 
museum throughout the summer 
sound recordings made in 1940 of air raid sirens the whine of 
aircraft and the distant crackle of machine guns usher visitors to 
the museum into a labyrinth of relics photographs an entire 
operations control room as it was at the height of the battle and 
the aircraft that took part 
besides a hurricane and a spitfire we have the best 
collection of german aircraft in the world said spokesman 
michael tagg 
visitors can see the messerschmitt 109 and 110 fighters the 
heinkel 111 and junkers 87 and 88 bombers and even an italian fiat 
cr 42 which made a forced landing during the only raid by the 
italian air force 
the biggest anniversary in the air is sept 15 when queen 
elizabeth ii will be on the buckingham palace balcony as a 12mile 
column of 163 veteran and modern aircraft flies above survivors of 
the few will line up in front of the palace 
here are some other places to go 
at londons imperial war museum is spitfire r6915 which shot 
down two german aircraft in the battle plans of the german 
invasion that never took place the story of radar flying 
equipment and medals and in the bookshop a dossier of reproduced 
documents selling for about 14 
visitors giving notice the day before can browse in the library 
among scores of books about the battle and british and german 
records of it 
dont miss paul nashs painting of a typical scene in the battle 
contrails over the english countryside 
at duxford a battle airfield near cambridge and 56 miles 
northwest of london is the imperial war museums huge collection 
of aircraft of both world wars including spitfires and hurricanes 
the whole place is an exhibit said tagg we restored it 
exactly as it was on sept 19 1940 and visitors can see how its 
squadrons were controlled 
duxford will stage an airshow of fighter planes july 8 
the cabinet war rooms in london built underground for 
protection from air raids close to the prime ministers official 
residence in downing street displays 21 historic rooms that served 
as headquarters for churchill the war cabinet and the chiefs of 
staff with desks bunks maps telephones and files just as they 
were at the wars end in 1945 
close by is westminster abbey with its battle of britain chapel 
its wall still marked by german bomb shrapnel 
at the port of dover the battles front line a complex of 
tunnels in the chalk cliffs is being opened to show operations 
rooms and where townspeople sheltered from raids 
less than 10 miles from dover is folkestone and nearby is 
hawkinge airfield an raf base during the battle it has a museum 
of british and german aircraft relics mementoes of such aces as 
robert stanford tuck and al deere all the weapons used in the 
battle by both sides and equipment and uniforms donated by british 
and german pilots 
visitors interested in buying relics can attend two auctions on 
sept 13 at bentley priory in stanmore northwest london 
headquarters of the british commander air chief marshal sir hugh 
dowding the only time the building will open the public and on 
sept 15 at the raf museum in hendon 
dowdings statue is in london outside st clement danes the raf 
headquarters church 
americans can make a pilgrimage to aptly named gravesend 25 
miles east of london to see the grave of detroitborn hugh 
reilley shot down in his spitfire by german ace werner moelders 
reilley was one of a handful of americans to get into the battle 
when the united states was still neutral 
all the airmen in the battle are commemorated in a memorial at 
runnymede 21 miles west of london where memorials to magna carta 
and us president john f kennedy are also located 
the battle of britain resulted from hitlers determination to 
force the country to surrender luftwaffe chief hermann goering 
told him he could force britain to its knees his fighters would 
shoot the royal air force out of the sky while his bombers would 
destroy raf airfields aircraft production factories and docks 
but although the raf was outnumbered 4 to 1 in aircraft it was 
fighting close to its bases it could rescue more pilots and 
salvage more planes than the germans the german codes had been 
broken and the radar early warning system pinpointed the location 
of the approaching enemy air fleets 
the raf came close to defeat but the germans did not know that 
and german losses in aircraft and men in the daylight battles were 
so unexpected that the luftwaffe turned to night bomber raids on 
british cities 
according to the comprehensive account in the book the battle 
of britain then and now the luftwaffe lost 2662 airmen killed 
and 1887 aircraft while the raf lost 537 airmen killed and 1023 
aircraft 
there are many books on the battle recommended are fighter 
by thrillerwriter len deighton and the narrow margin by derek 
wood and derek dempster 
the british tourist authority can supply a list of main events 
of the anniversary year

jesus hernandez 14 probably will grow up 
to be the mayor of this town he already is one of the best public 
relations men of this mexican colonial jewel 
we are honest people we do not do things we are not supposed 
to he explained to a visitor concerned about parking a car 
nearby 
but in addition to honest people jesus hometown of taxco 
little more than two hours away from mexico city offers a capsule 
of mexicos rich history from prehispanic days through the era of 
colonial legends to the present 
at night seen from the roof of a church of a neighoring town 
across a valley taxco rests sparkling on the side of a dark 
mountain made hollow by hundreds of years of gold and silver mining 
by indians spaniards and mexicans 
by day the city of nearly 130000 people is a small tableau of 
whitewashed homes and narrow winding streets dominated by the two 
towers of the santa prisca church built in 1748 
in aztec days taxco indians paid tribute in blocks of gold and 
silver according to legend now tourists flock to taxco to buy 
the silver handicrafts produced by scores of families who have made 
a living of the art for generations 
there still are several silver mines in operation now run by the 
government but the silver used in town by the artisans comes from 
the central bank in mexico city 
a visitor can buy wholesale silverplated bracelets for a few 
dollars pay 90 for a ceramic and silver dinner plate or spend as 
much as 5000 for a flower vase with silver and conch shell 
designs 
at the los castillo shop the vistors can watch artisans at 
their trade 
nearby at the elena ballesteros shop visitors are shown 
masterpieces combining coral and silver that won awards at the 
annual national competition 
the europeans and the japanese buy the expensive pieces 
said a shop attendant the americans want to buy souvenirs 
tourists walk the narrow streets climbing to the small plaza in 
front of the santa prisca church they wander in and out of shops 
where in addition to silver works they can find colorful baskets 
paintings and antiques like an 1887 edition of don quixote 
i came here to study architecture said hugo fernando lopez 
standing in front of his store made out of a large hole carved on 
the side of the mountain i started working with silver and then 
i opened this shop and now i spend a lot of time going around 
looking for antiques ill never leave 
young jesus has no plans to leave either at 14 he already has 
taken several courses in the local tourism school run by the 
government and speaks with the authority of an expert as he shows 
tourists the church and its surrounding areas while going on about 
taxcos history 
santa prisca was a young roman virgin who was thrown to the 
lions by a roman emperor but the lions would not touch her because 
she was a saint so the emperor ordered her beheaded jesus tells 
visitors to the church in an almost devout manner showing them a 
painting in one of the church naves 
he guides the visitors around to a side entrance because we 
must respect those who are praying to show them an altar with a 
copy of a monstrance or receptacle for the holy host the original 
weighed about 31 pounds in gold and is now at notre dame cathedral 
in paris 
the church is a colonial jewel with two large towers made of 
pink stone that are among the best examples of the 18th century 
churrigueresque style after the spanish architect jose 
churriguera often described as an exuberant baroque 
it was built by don jose de la borda who came to taxco as a 
young man of 16 and made and lost fortunes mining silver 
god gives to la borda and la borda gives to god reads his 
familys motto explaining his generosity to the church 
european artisans were brought in to build the church an 18th 
century german organ is still played and the churchs elaborate 
carvedwood altars are goldplated 
taxco is a short ride down from the mexico city valley south 
toward cuernavaca and then through the mountains on the highway to 
the pacific resort of acapulco 
its hotels can accomodate 895 they range from small hotels 
without television in the downtown area to the fivestar monte 
taxco hotel atop the mountain 
nearly 8000 foreign tourists visit taxco every month mexicans 
like it too and about 9000 of them also visit the town every 
month 
have you ever seen a sunset where the sky turns gold all 
around over the mountains said longtime resident armando 
rodriguez you can see it here

the glut of hotel rooms of a few years ago that 
enabled picky tourists to choose from an array of bargains has 
ended in fact things are so bad that two airlines plan to issue 
sleeping bags to stranded passengers 
room occupancy has been averaging more than 90 percent in recent 
months so singapore international airlines and the australian 
carrier qantas hope that sleeping bags will make unexpected 
layovers or flight delays at changi airport more bearable when no 
rooms are available 
sleeping bags will be used only as a last resort according to 
an sia spokesman but stranded passengers zipped into sleeping bags 
in designated areas is certainly far better than letting them lie 
around the transit halls he says 
this citystate of 26 million people expects 5 million visitors 
this year it has 68 hotels and 24142 rooms now with 72 hotels 
and 26185 rooms expected to be available by the end of 1992 
by then the raffles hotel a 104yearold landmark is expected 
to reopen after a 52million facelift 
room rates heavily discounted as recently as two years ago are 
expected to increase as much as 40 percent in the next two years 
one stopgap under study is to offer apartments in government 
housing projects for visitors on a bedandbreakfast basis 
singapore became a regional tourist stopover mainly because 
visitors could pick up some bargains on their way to the beaches of 
bali or the temples in thailand but there are few bargains these 
days only freespenders from japan and taiwan might find it 
relatively inexpensive because the local dollar has depreciated 
along with its us counterpart 
with few natural and manmade attractions the tourist promotion 
board plugged the island successfully in the 1970s as instant 
asia a clean and crimefree metropolis where most people spoke 
english and the water was safe to drink 
in one promotion visitors could book breakfast at the 
zoological gardens with an orangutan named ah meng the ape with 
impeccable table manners proved a popular attraction 
spurred by the euphoria of surging tourism in the mid and late 
1970s and optimistic forecasts that the boom would continue 
developers built more hotels than tourists could fill some 8000 
rooms were added in 198286 a 57 percent increase 
when overall occupancy plummeted hoteliers cut staff and closed 
entire floors to save on energy and maintenance at least six new 
hostelries delayed opening several went into receivership 
bargain room rates eventually helped bring foreigners back the 
government still markets singapore as the exotic east despite 
complaints that urban renewal wiped out most of chinatown and other 
colorful old sites it also seeks to maintain its standing as one 
of the top convention cities in asia 
the brusselsbased international union of associations ranks 
singapore ninth in the world for international meetings 
sleeping bags or not the stakes are high by 1987 the tourist 
sector generated the equivalent of 124 billion or 6 percent of 
the countrys gross domestic product

the third district of budapest lying 
on the buda side is likely to be overlooked by the average visitor 
to the city although it adjoins the major tourist areas of the 
fishermens bastion and margaret island with its hot springs and 
luxury hotels 
it deserves a closer look it is a place where antiquity the 
nearer past and the present all come together 
if you take the boat upstream to the medieval town and 
presentday artistic center of szentendre youll be going past the 
third district much of the way the handy electric train known by 
its initials hev and costing about 10 cents goes right through the 
third district on the way to szentendre 
consider names of two of the train stations aquincum and roman 
furdo bath 
yes the romans were here they conquered the pannonians of 
illyrian stock in 9 ad and formed the province of pannonia 
later divided into upper and lower pannonia 
aquincum was the capital of lower pannonia and the layout of 
the town is still apparent showing outlines of the amphitheaters 
of the roman military town and the roman civil town including a 
pillared hall and the sites of some town houses the museum at the 
site contains statuary coins jewelry a waterorgan a jupiter 
column and other artifacts of aquincums roman days aquincum has 
hours like any other museum complex a check with your hotel or 
ibusz the hungarian tourist office is advised though much of it 
can be seen from the train and surrounding streets 
aquincum eventually formed the nucleus of obuda old buda 
which joined with buda and pest in the early 1870s to become 
budapest obuda according to tradition was the residence of 
attila the hun who in the fifth century won big concessions from 
the romans later in the ninth century arpad and the magyars took 
over the region and established the first dynasty of hungarian 
kings the town flourished in the middle ages and the remains of a 
palace for hungarian queens are still in evidence then came the 
turks and the town fell into decay germanspeaking settlers put 
it back on its feet in the 17th century 
much of budapest once was farmland and this is evident in the 
area between aquincum and the city line in bekamsmegyer highrise 
white box apartment blocks face streets of stuccoed old peasant 
houses with tile roofs and chimneys originally built to vent the 
big tile stoves that were a traditional source of heat in such 
houses here are orchards vegetable plots and enough crows for a 
midwestern corn field services still are held in the old church 
and the neighborhood restaurant operates in one of the old 
buildings with gypsy music to go with its tasty fare 
but then turn around and confront the present walking among the 
apartment houses with lobbies of unadorned concrete lit by raw 
lightbulbs upstairs the apartments are likely to be attractive 
and modern with traditional hungarian embroidered pillows on the 
couches and sofa beds that budapests housing shortage mandates in 
every living room traditional plates painted with flowers may hang 
on the walls sometimes clashing with those hung by the younger 
set decorated with distorted faces and the word punk 
during the most recent christmas season many families sat up 
until midnight beside their lighted trees listening to the 
television news of the government upset in romania many of the 
older generation came from or have relatives in transylvania where 
romanias hungarian minority lives 
on a typical day shoppers go early in the morning to the 
supermarket in bekasmegyer to get fresh rolls for breakfast and buy 
their days supply of coffee beans which they grind on the spot 
in the evening highrise dwellers walk their dogs 
this is a blue collar district where young people go off to 
work with computers in the government as accountants or even as 
rock musicians many older people work too even if its only 
selling their embroidery 
roman antiquities seem far away but theyre just down the road 
the jampacked hev train taking commuters to work at 6 am will 
pass between one of the aquincum amphitheaters and the remains of a 
roman wall

the beaches and mountains still attract millions of americas 
vacationing families but the high seas are luring a growing share 
of the nations travelers 
according to travel industry observers the number of families 
among the more than 35 million americans who take cruises annually 
has increased dramatically 
the most important reason is the price says bob dickinson 
senior vicepresident of sales and marketing for carnival cruise 
lines 
special rates for children has made cruising one of the most 
affordable and relaxing ways for families to take a vacation he 
notes adding that for families with infants his companys ships 
are equipped with cribs and high chairs and babysitting is 
available at a nominal charge 
according to dickinson several cruise lines have developed a 
special onboard schedule of activities especially for children 
on carnival cruises for example events geared toward ages 412 
might include a scavenger hunt a shipdrawing contest and a soft 
drink party with the captain 
a teen schedule might feature a name that tune contest or 
teen trivia contest pingpong tournament and disco party 
dickinson says all onboard facilities including discos video 
game rooms and swimming pools are available to younger passengers 
as well as a playroom which serves as their own gathering place 
youngsters especially enjoy kite flying bingo and movie time 
he adds explaining 
we find that many of them like participating in our programs 
more than any other aspect of the cruise and quite often prefer 
to stay on board rather than go ashore at the various ports of 
call 
programs for children ages 612 are offered by the norwegian 
cruise line on board its fleet of six ships on some of the ships 
programs are offered yearround with shipboard youth coordinators 
to plan and supervise activities 
highlights include a circus at sea where children learn circus 
routines like juggling and clowning a tour of the bridge treasure 
hunts games and a cookout many cruises offer special shore 
excursions exclusively for the kids 
among the companies offering programs tailored for families is 
new yorkbased regency cruises which has one for single parents or 
grandparents at discounted rates 
in addition to the usual childrens activities such as pool 
parties talent shows and coketail parties a specially 
designated clubhouse is equipped just for kids 
regency also encourages families to have shipboard reunions and 
any group of at least eight related adults traveling together gets 
a champagne bon voyage party souvenir photos and a happy 
reunion cake at the captains welcome dinner 
particularly appealing to adults and youngsters alike are river 
cruises aboard the mississippi queen billed as the largest 
steamboat the world has ever known and the delta queen recently 
designated a national historic landmark 
the two boats are operated by the delta queen steamboat co of 
new orleans which this year is celebrating its 100th anniversary 
vacation cruises range from three to ll nights 
a somewhat different luxury river cruise new from french cruise 
lines this year takes the traveler to the rivers rhone and saone 
in the french provinces following the route of the visigoths and 
romans crusaders and popes kings and queens 
the company also will sail the justlaunched 100passenger ms 
arlene on a series of oneweek discovery cruises in the heart of 
burgundy with its vineyards and avignon with its palace of the 
popes 
other offbeat cruise programs for 1990 include 
an 18day china dynasty package between hong kong and 
beijing offered by pearl cruises of fort lauderdale fla the 
people who need us most the young people are eager to again speak 
to the foreign visitor to gain knowledge of other countries their 
lifestyles their thoughts says robert eversen company 
president 
a journey aboard the 88passenger americana down the east 
coast of the us and south america from new york to buenos aires 
this combination passengerfreighter ship operated by ivaran 
lines offers luxury accommodations even while carrying such cargo 
as automobile parts coffee leather goods vegetable oils and 
school books 
a gametrackers flying boat safari down the great rift of 
africa which uses a converted catalina seaplane to reach often 
remote and unspoiled areas of africa almost impossible to visit by 
surface transportation among the experiences included are gorilla 
trekking in zaire after the aircraft lands on mysterious lake kivu

celebration outside of greece 
dallas is about the only city which is celebrating this 
anniversary of democracy mrs nick says i feel the children 
of today do not know a lot about democracy 
there is so much that greece gave to the world and it seems 
to be a forgotten thing these days 
with the upheaval in eastern europe the celebration of 
democracy is particularly fitting she adds 
the greek ministry of culture will showcase an extensive series 
of exhibits in dallas according to joint organizer spyros 
mercouris who is the brother of former culture minister melina

among the exhibits planned are 
athens birthplace of democracy about architecture and

contemporary artists they show what we are doing now in 
greece mercouris said

dallas museum of art beginning april 8 featuring jewelry and 
ritual objects from greece africa and the ancient americas

weight watchers magazine which devotes its july issue to 
travel provides some advice for keeping the fat out of your 
vacation while leaving the fun in 
plan ahead request special meals while buying plane tickets 
for example 
with regular airplane food scrape the sauce off the entree 
have one or two bites and eat the bread dont pour dressing on 
the salad but dip the fork into the dressing then eat some salad 
for long flights take snacks from home like fresh fruit or 
vegetables sealed in plastic bags and stay out of the airport 
snack shops if your flight is delayed 
choose one realistic goal for the trip like splitting 
desserts 
for car travel pack a small cooler with diet sodas iced tea 
bottled water individual cereal boxes yogurt fruits and 
vegetables for crunchier snacks bring popcorn 
in restaurants order sauce on the side to control the amount 
you eat ask for fresh fruit with whipped topping for dessert or 
split a dessert with someone else if youre having pizza have it 
plain and skip the sausage pepperoni and other greasy toppings 
if you do eat heavily one day go light the next with a little 
bit of protein and some carbohydrates include fruits and 
vegetables and drink plenty of water

heres a word of advice about taking 
your pet with you on your vacation 
dont 
vacations arent for pets says dr ken clever professor of 
veterinary medical technology at wilson college they and you 
will be happier if you place them in a good boarding facility or 
with a trusted friend or family member 
motion sickness and heat exhaustion are the most likely problems 
your pet will encounter according to clever and other odder 
dangers can come up he recalls treating a dog that had been 
dragged a halfmile on an interstate highway because the owner had 
tied it to the bumper of his car during a rest stop and then forgot 
about it 
if you insist on taking your pet then plan for accommodating 
the animal on the road 
take your pet on a test ride or two before the trip to determine 
if it will get motion sickness this problem is very common with 
dogs and cats your veterinarian can prescribe a medication to 
prevent vomiting he adds that its not a good idea to medicate 
an animal on a justincase basis 
you may also find that cats sometimes get a little excited on 
trips he says the veterinarian can advise you about sedatives 
for overly active pets 
plan adequate room for the animal to move around you 
shouldnt stuff a pet into an already crowded car nor should you 
keep the animal in the front seat where the animal could distract 
the driver he says the back seat is the safest spot since 
theres no way to secure a pet with a seat belt 
if you must leave your pet in the car roll the windows down a 
bit this may seem like obvious advice clever says but many 
owners forget and their pets suffer heat exhaustion 
another problem is accommodation since many places wont take 
pets you will have to map out the trip more closely than usual to 
assure a place to stay clever suggests campgrounds since more of 
them welcome pets 
before you go be sure your pets vaccinations are up to date 
this protects the animal from diseases in new places and it 
protects you legally when you travel to a state with different 
regulations the doctor recommends taking your pets health 
certification records along as a minimum youll need proof of 
rabies vaccination if your pet bites someone during the trip 
international regulations are usually much more stringent so check 
them before you leave

owners of nearly 15 million timeshare condominiums rent out 
their units without profit according to a survey commissioned by 
the resort property owners association 
weve known for years that consumer owners have been renting 
their property for peanuts what we didnt know until this survey 
was that the majority of consumer owners are renting these luxury 
condos or villas for as little as 40 to 110 per night says 
clinton burr rpoa president 
the survey shows that 60 percent of consumer owners rent out 
their condos at between 250 and 750 per week and 65 percent of 
these vacation condos are priced below hotel room rates in their 
communities this means that condo rentals in the most expensive 
resort communities like hawaii vail and palm springs have average 
rental rates less than 100 a night for a one or twobedroom condo 
with a kitchen travel agents and vacationers should consider condo 
rentals when planning a vacation says burr 
despite the low return 38 percent of the owners said they were 
satisfied and another 23 percent said they were very 
satisfied with property ownership 
if your life seems to revolve around a computer then being able 
to rent one on the road will help keep you connected theres 
always a shortterm need for computers and computer peripherals 
but a lot of people who have this need are unaware they can rent 
says george reitsma president of pcr personal computer rentals he 
estimates the current market for renting to corporations and 
individuals at about 250 million shared by around 400 firms his 
company has 55 franchises around the country for information call

here are some important factors to consider 
when shopping for medigap insurance as suggested by the senate 
special committee on aging 
review medicares gaps in coverage to determine what is 
important to you in a supplement consider policy features 
premiums waiting periods preexisting condition exclusions and 
maximum benefit clauses 
work with hometown agents and companies you know a company 
must meet certain qualifications to do business in your state 
talk with friends who have had good claims experiences 
investigate group insurance sold by legitimate organizations 
but remember some senior citizen or retired person organizations 
are legitimate and some are set up as fronts to get your business 
while some of these plans are good deals others are not as good as 
individual plans 
take into consideration any other coverage you have that 
continues beyond age 65 
consider how much you can afford to pay for hospital or 
medical bills and how much you can afford for supplemental health 
insurance premiums 
as a general rule buy one good comprehensive medicare 
supplemental policy there are some exceptions if you have an 
employer group policy that is affordable but limited in benefits 
check for special circumstances for which the insurance 
company may eliminate coverage for a health condition you had 
before you bought the policy a policy may refer to this as a 
preexisting condition 
beware of replacing existing coverage be suspicious of a 
suggestion that you give up any policy and buy a replacement often 
new policies will impose a waiting period or will have exclusions 
and waiting periods for preexisting conditions this means you may 
have to wait for up to six months before you will be eligible to 
collect anything on a new policy 
beware of maximum benefits most policies have a limit on 
benefits that may be expressed in dollars available or the number 
of days for which payments will be made 
check your right to renew beware of policies that let the 
company refuse to renew your policy on an individual basis a 
policy that is guaranteed renewable is preferable 
remember policies to supplement medicare are neither sold nor 
serviced by state or federal governments do not believe statements 
that insurance to supplement medicare is governmentsponsored 
dont pay cash write a check or money order payable to the 
company not the agent 
keep the agents andor companies names addresses and 
telephone numbers so that you can contact them easily in case of 
problems 
the medigap insurance market is highly competitve take your 
time do not let a shortterm enrollment period pressure you and 
remember that some states prohibit special enrollment periods

the people at lucilles service station have 
pumped gas on route 66 long enough to see history buffs start 
getting mileage out of it 
eula mae brown 67 remembers when it was something to have the 
traveler perched on the nehi icebox at her fathers hydro station 
turn out to be from the east coast 
i always found it just exciting mrs brown said some of 
the people who talked a different dialect would amuse me so 
now the people who pull up to the pumps under the stations 
oldfashioned clapboard overhang talk with british accents 
australian accents 
they ask lucille hamons to autograph her photograph in a glossy 
book on route 66 that confirms her status as living history mrs 
hamons has run the station since her husband took it over in 1941 
14 years after mrs browns father built it 
mrs hamons sells sandwiches and soft drinks from her gas 
station and since 1966 also has sold what she calls the coldest 
beer in oklahoma 
you know who will be coming here next dont you itll be the 
japanese mrs hamons says anticipating the next wave of 
tourists on the highway that ran from chicago to the west coast 
tulsa writer michael wallis said he already has seen japanese 
among the tourists and filmmakers at barbecue joints and cafes 
along route 66 this year four independent filmmakers are working 
on documentaries about the highway he said 
st martins press is due to publish wallis own book about the 
road this spring wallis plans to tool down 66 in a 1964 corvette 
to promote it 
route 66 crosses eight states and three time zones starting out 
at the shores of lake michigan in illinois it makes its winding 
wooded way south from the lake and from oklahoma city on makes a 
pretty straight shot through the western plains and desert over 
the rocky mountains and through arid country again to the beach at 
santa monica 
it opens to four lanes in spots but is mainly a twolane 
highway with curbs and curves that used to send packards and 
plymouths spinning off the road and into tree trunks 
legislation is under way to make all 2400 miles a national 
monument this winter kansas became the eighth and final state to 
establish a route 66 association devoted to the 12 miles that hook 
through its territory wallis said 
oklahoma tourism is catching on promoters plan a route 66 car 
rally and a mr and mrs route 66 contest this summer businesses 
are capitalizing on the route 66 moniker to sell everything 
from art to antiques 
oklahoma could capitalize on route 66 retaining more of its old 
feel than it does in some other states wallis said 
oklahoma also happens to be the only state that earned a 
qualitative statement in a song listing the quantity of cities 
lining route 66 saint louey joplin missouri and oklahoma 
city is mighty pretty 
bobby troup thought up the song as he drove out to california 
when he got out of the service pop singer michael martin murphy is 
putting it through its 25th recording wallis said 
its a song about getting your nostalgia kicks on route 66 
but this is a case where nostalgia has really symbolized the 
best of something wallis said its still a corridor of 
america thats not generic 
its an america thats before fax machines and fern bars 
before the malling of america he said i remember when it was 
an adventure starting when dad used to back the plymouth down the 
highway 
for lucilles in hydro there were 40 years when i cant even 
think how you could have left new york city and go to the coastline 
without coming by our little store mrs brown said 
she saw the first pioneers to try out the notion of a road that 
let one drive from lake michigan to the pacific ocean without once 
having to stop to ask directions 
mrs hamons saw the exodus of okies distinguishable from the 
arkies she said by the single rather than the double layer of 
mattresses on top of their cars she saw the postworld war ii 
migration in which singer troup took part and supplied nehis and 
rented cabins to the tourists who followed 
mrs hamons started selling beer to survive after road crews 
plowed up a temporary ramp leading off newly built interstate 40 
parallel to 66 she said 
she has a case for claiming the title of longest continually 
operating merchant on route 66 in oklahoma fern bar and shopping 
mall development hasnt spoiled her stretch of route 66 because 
there was little development money after the interstate came 
today mrs hamons sells route 66 tshirts coffee mugs and 
refrigerator magnets along with beer she is thinking of opening 
one of the tourist cabins out back to accommodate an expected 
increase in trade this summer 
its what youve seen and who youve come to know she 
said to me thats 66 its not so much a moneymaking deal 
its just memories 
its memories to lucille wallis said its making a buck 
to everyone else 
route 66 is and was a commercial proposition wallis 
said people trying to make a living selling postcards tanks of 
gas a room for the night greasy cheeseburgers a look at the 
snake pit 
now merchants from saint louey to san bernadino are hawking 
memories americans wallis said are buying a chance to 
rediscover themselves on the ribbon of time

the head of a giant lending company says hes 
taking steps to guard against cases like the one in which his 
company tried to seize the home of an elderly impoverished widow 
other loan files from transamerica financial services 
scottsdale office will be reviewed but any problems are likely to 
be local said arthur van leuven chief executive officer of 
transamerica financial group and executive vice president of its 
parent transamerica corp 
transcripts of court testimony by a former loan officer 
persuaded transamerica to drop its fight with 77yearold lennie 
williams van leuven said in a recent telephone interview 
it was really not a hard decision he said it was a 
slamdunk 
the battle began after mrs williams allowed her small 
42yearold home to be used as security for a loan her soninlaw 
took out from transamerica financial services inc the 
corporations arizona operation 
the soninlaw disappeared with the money according to court 
records and transamerica began foreclosure on the home after mrs 
williams who supports herself on pensions of 438 a month was 
unable to keep up with monthly loan payments of 499 a month 
volunteer lawyers fought back the loan officer who handled mrs 
williams loan testified that he doubted whether she understood 
what she was doing and a doctor who was treating her at the time 
testified that she wasnt capable of remembering which pill to 
take much less of understanding loan agreements 
even after a maricopa county superior court judge in january 
ordered a temporary halt to the foreclosure and said it was likely 
transamerica knew or should have known something was wrong when 
it made the loan the companys lawyers pursued the case and 
demanded that mrs williams post bond of 450 a month pending trial 
last month an associated press story detailed mrs williams 
plight at about the same time senior officials at transamerica 
financial group received a transcript of the loan officers 
testimony according to van leuven 
it became apparent from that transcript that two parties had 
been victimized he said lennie williams is one of them and 
transamerica is the other 
the company decided to drop all proceedings against mrs 
williams and proceed only against the soninlaw because it is 
far easier for us to stand the victimization than for lennie 
williams van leuven said 
the company will return payments mrs williams made to the court 
and will review other loans by its scottsdale office to ensure 
there arent any similar cases he said 
the review will be difficult because there was nothing in mrs 
williams file to indicate an unusual transaction until her lawyers 
began complaining he said 
mrs williams attorney michael curran said a tentative 
agreement had been reached in her case 
she was just completely relieved when we finally were able to 
get it through to her that she was never going to have to worry 
about someone taking her house again said another of her 
lawyers douglas erickson

some people are born with the belief 
that they are masters of their own lives others feel they are at 
the mercy of fate 
new research shows that some of those feelings are in the genes 
psychologists long have known that people confident in their 
ability to control their destinies are more likely to adjust well 
to growing old than others 
two researchers who questioned hundreds of swedish twins report 
that such confidence or lack of it is partly genetic and partly 
drawn from experience 
they also found that the belief in blind luck that coincidence 
plays a big role in life is something learned and has nothing to 
do with heredity 
the research was conducted at the karolinska institute which 
annually awards the nobel prize for medicine by karolinskas nancy 
pedersen and margaret gatz a psychology professor at the 
university of southern california their results recently were 
published in the united states in the journal of gerontology 
the study of twins who have identical or similar genes 
eliminates genetics as the explanation of differences said richard 
j rose professor of psychology and medical genetics at indiana 
university variances in twins must then be attributed to their 
distinct environment and experiences 
the result of the gatzpedersen study is consistent with other 
world literature on the subject but has the added importance of 
being based on a far larger and more representative sample than 
previous research rose said 
the belief in your ability to control your life direction or 
the belief in your own competence is 30 percent something you are 
born with said gatz interviewed during a consultation visit to 
sweden 
people who are confident of their ability to control their lives 
have an internal locus of control and a better chance of being 
well adjusted in old age said pedersen 
an external locus of control believing that outside forces 
determine the course of life has been linked to depression in 
later years she said 
this is one of the windows on the aging process said 
pedersen who has published a series of studies on the genetics of 
personality traits based on interviews with twins the study on 
lifecontrol involved 554 pairs of twins 
we are trying to understand what makes people different what 
makes some people age gracefully and others have a more difficult 
time she said whether people feel independent is an important 
standard for service institutions and how they treat the elderly 
the study showed that while people have an inborn predilection 
toward independence and selfconfidence about 70 percent of this 
personality trait is affected by a persons environment and 
experiences 
pedersens studies with various collaborators probe the aging 
process by comparing sets of twins identical and fraternal many 
of whom were separated at an early age 
the subjects were drawn from a roster first compiled about 30 
years ago registering all twins born in sweden since 1886 the 
complete list which was extended in 1971 has 95000 sets of twins 
rose said the registry based on the whole population is an 
unusually powerful tool us researchers have nothing 
comparable and normally rely on twins who respond to 
advertisements 
karolinska professor anders ahlbom who runs the registry said 
80 percent to 85 percent of twins typically respond to 
questionnaires sent by researchers 
pedersen said that studies of twins who were reared separately 
but have identical or nearly identical genes compared with twins 
reared together can yield a unique measure of naturevsnurture 
in human development 
earlier research by pedersen showed that a variety of other 
characteristics are 30 percent to 40 percent determined by a 
persons genetic makeup including many of those traits comprising 
what has become known as type a behavior 
the type a person the harddriving worker who brings home his 
work from the office eats too fast keeps his foot on the clutch 
at traffic lights and makes a point of being on time has been 
found to have a higher risk of heart disease before age 65

older first cousins who got married in new mexico 
are asking the legislature to change arizona law so their marriage 
is legal here 
a bill which would apply to couples over 65 cleared the house 
recently and was sent to the senate on a 4020 vote 
rep lela steffey said she introduced the bill on behalf of ruth 
and henry hinkley who were married last year and have been unable 
to persuade the state office of veterans affairs to recognize the 
marriage which could jeopardize their veterans benefits mrs 
steffey said 
a lot more people support it than i had anticipated because 
theres no harm to it mrs steffey said 
indeed at least one other lawmaker said the bill might not go 
far enough rep margaret updike noted that some states allow first 
cousins to marry without age restrictions 
mrs steffey said she chose 65 as a cutoff because she had heard 
that the oldest woman to become pregnant was 58 and she wanted to 
ensure there could be no offspring 
state law prohibits marriage between parents and children 
siblings uncles and nieces aunts and nephews and first cousins 
it is intended to reduce the risk of children being born with 
genetic problems 
although the bill was criticized as legislation intended to 
benefit one couple mrs steffey said she has heard from several 
cousins in similar situations 
one new jersey couple learned about arizonas marriage 
restriction during a recent visit and delayed plans to move here 
pending passage of mrs steffeys bill she said 
mrs steffey said she believes that because 29 other states 
allow first cousins to marry in some situations that there may be 
many more cousins in arizona who either have kept their marriage 
secret or who dont realize such marriages are not recognized here 
mrs hinkley who is 72 has hit roadblocks in trying to care 
for her 89yearold husband who is blind nearly deaf and has had 
one leg amputated mrs steffey said 
the states failure to recognize the marriage also could keep 
mrs hinkley from receiving benefits should her husband die mrs 
steffey said 
mrs steffey said she recommended the couple consider moving 
back to new mexico 
she could move back that probably wouldnt be any big 
problem mrs steffey said but he couldnt move hes in 
extremely poor shape hes in a nursing home here

do you remember as a kid your mother saying as soon as you 
eat your brownies you can have your peas and carrots no way 
you had to push through some usually overcooked and 
underseasoned canned or frozen vegetables to get to dessert 
sometimes salads stood in for the vegetable but front and center 
was meat and potatoes 
now for optimum health we are encouraged to eat richly and in 
greater variety from the vegetable kingdom how do we proceed as 
one friend of mind said over lunch i know fred and i should be 
eating more vegetables but how do you make them interesting if 
you head to your local bookstore or public library vegetable 
cookbooks are taking up not one shelf but whole units of shelving 
offering thousands of recipes from every culture including our own 
at our supermarkets more and more space is given over to fresh 
produce with exotic fruits and vegetables from around the world 
often tagged with a recipe on how to use them when you stop to 
think about it almost all regional and international favorites 
feature a preponderance of vegetables grains beans even fruits 
meat is a component that is excluded or included the most 
appearing on feast days 
whether its couscous curries or cassoulet the seasonings 
define the dish two of my favorites are vegetable curry and black 
bean chili i also enjoy vegetables in different ways at each meal 
as entree and as salad say a stir fry and a slaw or as a 
container squash or peppers filled with grains beans vegetables 
or meat fermented black bean sauce or pesto goes over fish 
chicken and pasta oldfashioned pickled beets and cucumbers or 
the new variety of fresh salsas as condiments and as a yearround 
entree vegetable salad 
whenever possible buy from green farms in your city or 
farmstands when you buy at the supermarket experiment with a 
fruit or vegetable that is new to you for familiar vegetables ask 
the manager if they are dyed or waxed taking creative 
responsibility for your health is essential

asparagus has sublime flavor beauty 
lineage in a word class and a gardner who achieves a 
wellestablished bed gets respect 
a wouldbe asparagus grower needs patience and determination it 
takes a good five years to have harvests worth talking about 
in a mobile society this eliminates a lot of people whos 
going to plant a vegetable for some future tenant to enjoy but if 
youve settled down or retired an asparagus bed is a giltedged 
investment producing abundantly and requiring little effort to 
maintain 
asparagus ranks as one of the oldest vegetables little 
different in its cultivated state from the wild spears of remote 
ages menus recovered from the ruins of pompeii show the romans 
enjoyed young asparagus as a spring delicacy 
my own 21yearold patch a mere child in the annals of 
asparagus longevity yielded 702 fat thin and mediumsize spears 
in 1989 586 in 1988 and 607 in 1987 thats a lot of asparagus out 
of a 15by10foot bed more than the needs of my wife and me and 
we gave much of it to our neighboring son 
in terms of waiting think of asparagus as an apple tree or 
blueberry bush unlike most vegetables which you plant anew every 
year asparagus is perennial after youve first dug in the roots 
they bear year after year european chronicles tell of 100yearold 
asparagus beds bestowed as dowries in marriage contracts 
asparagus thrives everywhere in the united states except areas 
of the deep south and west where winters are too mild in my 
garden 50 miles north of new york city asparagus starts coming up 
in late april and yields continuously until midjune then i stop 
cutting and let the spears grow to handsome ferns as tall as eight 
feet which feed the roots for next years crop 
one of the joys of asparagus is its early arrival youve hardly 
started getting the rest of the garden ready for summer and here 
you are harvesting a delicious vegetable another plus is that the 
spears come up a few at a time thus you have prolonged harvests 
once out of the ground a spear grows incredibly fast as much 
as 10 inches in a day six to eight inches is a good cutting 
height after that the spears get woody at the base 
asparagus may be grown from seed but you save time by planting 
roots acquired at nurseries or seed houses worldwide about 35 
varieties are cultivated in the united states the best known are 
mary and martha washington introduced early this century recently 
new allmale cultivars with names like jersey giant have appeared 
and are getting good reviews for larger yields and better disease 
resistance 
because of the time involved in establishing a bed however it 
wouldnt be practical for some of us to experiment with different 
varieties my martha washington keeps producing generously ill 
leave new cultivars to new gardeners 
the most work youll probably ever do with asparagus comes at 
the start in planting the roots in early spring in a 
welltilled sunny spot you dig trenches about a foot deep and a 
foot wide in rows about three feet apart pack the bottom of the 
trenches with wellrotted manure or compost mounding this up and 
spread the roots over the mounds about two feet apart then you 
bury the roots leaving the crowns two to three inches below the 
surface sixteen roots should be plenty for a family of three 
in this first year youll get some thin spears leave these 
alone too you can start cutting the third year but it will be a 
while after that before you have a really prolific bed 
in the meantime your biggest problem will be weeds how do you 
remove them without disturbing the asparagus roots i solved this 
by mulching the bed with a couple of inches of salt hay obtainable 
in bales from nurseries the mulch stifles weeds but allows spears 
to come through then it decomposes into fine compost helping the 
fertility of the bed i put on a bale a year 
in the middle of june when i stop cutting i push the mulch 
aside and spread some fertilizer around the spears then i push the 
mulch back on except for a little dusting to deal with insects 
thats all i do the ferns die back in the fall and i wait for the 
cycle to begin again with that first great taste of newborn 
asparagus next april

a hearing aid could mask that problem 
hearing aids are sold by physicians audiologists and hearing 
aid dealers and there are three kinds of hearing aids 
behindtheear models those that go in the ear and those that fit

americas elderly are losing ground 
financially as rising health care costs consume everlarger shares 
of their income according to a study by the house select committee 
on aging 
the report said any advantage that the elderly may have by 
entering retirement with higher incomes than a decade ago will be 
quickly lost as health and longterm care costs absorb larger 
portions of their income 
while virtually all lower and middleincome americans feel 
some pressure from these costs the problem is acute for people 
whose incomes rise no faster than overall inflation said 
committee chairman edward r roybal dcalif 
the report found that people retiring in any given year will see 
healthcare costs rise more than 1 times faster than their income 
outofpocket health care costs rose from 123 percent of elderly 
income in 1977 to 182 percent in 1988 it said 
all indications are that this trend of costs outpacing income 
will continue into the foreseeable future and that health costs are 
likely to reach 20 percent of elderly income by the early 1990s

the government has issued guidelines to help 
ensure that new drugs are adequately tested to determine their 
effects on older people 
there is widespread agreement that many drugs even those 
likely to be used in the elderly have not always been extensively 
studied in elderly patients the food and drug administration 
said in a public notice as a consequence there has often been 
little information available to guide therapy in such patients 
the agency issued guideline for the study of drugs likely to 
be used in the elderly 
the publicaton was welcomed by rep thomas downey dny who 
said they were overdue given growing concerns about mismedication 
and drug misuse among the elderly 
the health and welfare of millions of older americans depends 
on a serious commitment by the fda to ensure that available drug 
therapy is safe and effective downey said

a backlog of 5 billion in defense orders 
ensures the nations cuts in military spending will have a slow 
impact on westinghouse electric corp the companys chief said 
prior to the recent talk of a peace dividend westinghouse has 
had a goal of reducing its reliance on defense chairman john c 
marous said 
management last year committed to spending 100 million 
internally to develop 19 defense programs that have the potential 
to grow into 1 billion businesses marous said but westinghouse 
is counting on only three of those to reach that level 
even so marous warned congress must ensure spending cuts dont 
cripple development of technology 
theres no question theres going to be some form of a peace 
dividend he told pittsburgh financial analysts friday i think 
the real key though is how they cut the defense budget because 
theres two pieces 
people and bases are one piece technology the other marous 
said 
the technology lead this country has today rests primarily in 
the military and space program he said if we start cutting in 
the technology area which politically is the easy thing to do 
were going to have problems 
marous said he presented his arguments on technology with vice 
president dan quayle who was in pittsburgh recently 
westinghouse the nations 13th largest defense contractor 
wont be hurt by defense cuts because it has positioned itself in 
programs that it believes will be spared the knife the chairman 
said 
three years ago 22 percent of the business of westinghouses 
defense systems group was nondefense marous set a goal of 
increasing that share to 50 percent by 1995 and changed the 
divisions name to the electronic systems group to emphasize the 
change 
westinghouse plans to apply its defense technology to 
nondefense businesses in areas such as airtraffic control marous 
said in the past month westinghouse won the job to develop an air 
traffic control system in poland and it is bidding for the same job 
in czechoslovakia he said 
in other areas marous said industrial and environmental 
services is probably the fastest growing business in 
westinghouse expanding at a rate of 30 percent a year

corporate raiders and junk bond traders arent 
the only ones to hit some rough bumps makers of stretch 
limousines a power symbol in the statusconscious 1980s are 
struggling as demand has shifted into low gear 
stretch limousine production has dropped off from the boom times 
during the reagan years when production jumped from about 2500 
limousines a year in 1980 to a peak of about 7000 in 1987 
some 57 coachbuilding companies including two in the chicago 
area now stretch only about 5700 limousines a year according to 
limousine and chauffeur the industry trade magazine 
stretch limousines were an ostentatious symbol of wealth in the 
money decade of the 1980s 
some corporations were spending up to 20000 a week on 
roundtheclock limo service said wayne smith executive 
director of the national limousine association in washington dc 
executives were doing multibilliondollar deals and the limo 
service played a role in beefing up the companys image he said 
but a slower economy troubles in the junkbond market the 
savings and loan fiasco and a slowdown in mergers and acquisitions 
all have contributed to cuts in corporate limousine service some 
budgetminded companies are trying to prune expensive frills 
the ostentatious look just isnt good for the corporate image 
anymore said joseph v scaletta president of moloney 
coachbuilders in chicago 
sales are down about 25 percent at moloney which makes about 
450 stretch limos a year scaletta attributes the drop to 
overbuilding 
but scaletta believes it is still possible to find other markets 
executives arent going for the superstretches anymore 
said scaletta but now that we are adding cellular phones fax 
machines and even small computers they see the benefit of having a 
traveling office 
another chicagoarea manufacturer limousine werks of 
schaumburg says it has looked to the foreign market 
company president matthew baines says sales are up 28 percent 
over last year in part due to a recent contract to make stretch 
cadillac limousines for japan he estimates production at about 
one a day 
the first limousine was a model g made in 1908 by cadillac said 
dave john cadillac fleet director in detroit 
in the 1960s as buyers increasingly demanded custom flourishes 
the major auto makers stopped customizing limousines and 
independent companies known as coach builders entered the scene 
these companies buy cadillacs lincoln continentals or other 
luxury cars as a coach builder package without a roof then 
they cut the cars in half stretch them by 8 inches to as much as 
100plus inches and fill them with whatever luxuries customers 
want from televisions and minibars to chandeliers and hot tubs 
a cadillac brougham at limousine werks costs from 53000 to 
62000 mercedes go for 135000 and armored cars start at 
100000 
changing times also have affected companies offering limousine 
service the airport trade is now their breadandbutter so they 
are positioning themselves as an affordable alternative to a taxi 
the airport trade accounts for 80 percent of the rides provided 
by the american limousine corp of suburban burr ridge which has a 
fleet of 150 cars said owner george jacobs who is also president 
of the national limousine association 
but jacobs believes the limousine will always stand for luxury 
and romance 
he recalls one young suitor who ordered two limousines when he 
wanted to propose to his girlfriend 
the first car took him to the lakefront where he proposed 
the second car came to pick up the first driver so the couple could 
be alone for a few hours said jacobs we didnt ask any 
questions

columbia savings amp loan 
association the oncehigh flying thrift that invested billions of 
dollars in highrisk junk bonds says it lost 379 million in the 
fourth quarter and 200 million during the first two months of this 
year and is now insolvent 
the disclosure on sunday increases the prospects for an 
expensive federal bailout 
columbia had been one of the nations most profitable sampls due 
to its large portfolio of highyielding junk bonds many of which 
were bought from michael milken and his securities firm the 
nowdefunct drexel burnham lambert group inc 
in the mid1980s columbias annual earnings approached 200 
million 
but the deterioration in the junk bond market over the past 
several months has forced columbia to write off much its holdings 
resulting in huge losses 
columbia said it lost 379 million or 1917 a share in the 
final quarter of 1989 compared to earnings of 16 million or 37 
cents a share in 1988 losses for the entire year came to 591 
million or 3011 a share vs net income of 65 million or 149 
per share the previous year 
the losses reflect junk bondrelated loss provisions and 
writedowns of about 500 million in the fourth quarter 
the company said that its shareholders equity or the firms 
value to its stockholders fell to minus 121 million at feb 28 
1990 rendering columbia insolvent under generally accepted 
accounting principles just three months earlier columbia had 
equity of 776 million 
in a statement columbia said it expected significant 
additional loss reserves and other asset writedowns will occur in 
march 1990 it said it had a loss of nearly 200 million in the 
first two months of 1990 because of further problems in the junk 
bond market 
but columbia is hoping to avoid federal receivership by 
liquidating its junk bond holdings 
we have initiated programs to reduce overhead significantly 
and to improve our traditional thrift operations edward g 
harshfield the thrifts newly appointed chief exectuvie said in a 
statement sunday 
between august and february columbia sold about 575 million in 
junk bonds and other securities according to the company 
federal regulators had imposed restrictions on columbia in 
november because of problems with its 38 billion junkbond 
portfolio had caused the thrifts capital to be substantially 
inadequate the office of thrift supervision restricted among 
other things columbias growth dividend payment and loan funding 
lending is now limited to residential loans not exceeding 500000 
columbias assets for 1989 totaled 93 billion down from 127 
billion in 1988 the thrift has 950 employees in 29 southern 
california offices

highlevel trade talks between japan and the 
united states resumed today as japanese prime minister toshiki 
kaifu dispatched two personal emissaries to try to work out 
solutions to the huge 49 billion trade imbalance between the two 
nations 
kaifu called bush to renew his pledge to seek solutions to the 
trade disputes that have split the two nations he told bush that 
he was sending the two emissaries to washington to express the 
prime ministers personal commitment to solving problems the 
white house announced 
bush asked by reporters in atlanta if the trade talks with 
japan were in trouble said 
i had a very fruitful conversation with the prime minister of 
japan this morning and we will see but i must say i am encouraged 
by recent progress but well wait and see more to follow soon on 
that 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters in 
atlanta that the two emissaries former japanese ambassador nobuo 
matsunaga and deputy foreign minister hisashi owada would meet 
with secretary of state james a baker iii and national security 
adviser brent scowcroft 
fitzwater said the emissaries would meet with bush on wednesday 
the discussions were being held as other us and japanese 
negotiators were resuming talks aimed at addressing broadscale 
barriers to trade in both nations 
the bush administration is pinning its hopes on making 
significant reductions in the trade deficit with japan which 
accounted for almost half of americas total trade imbalance last 
year on the socalled structural impediments initiative which 
take place today and tuesday 
there were reports that the japanese were bringing a new set of 
concessions with them designed to open their markets to sales of 
american products 
over the weekend negotiators said both sides are close to 
agreement on proposals to expand sales of americanmade satellites 
to japanese government agencies the agreement was similar to an 
accord reached a week ago on the issue of supercomputer sales to 
japanese universities and other government agencies 
and late on friday us and japanese negotiators announced 
agreement on steps that would further open the japanese market to 
americanmade telecommunications products the new pact was reached 
just before a saturday deadline that could have triggered us 
retaliation 
todays phone call between bush and kaifu represented a 
followup to a summit meeting held last month in california at 
which the two leaders searched for ways to get the stalled trade 
talks moving again 
american negotiators expressed disappointment that three 
previous rounds of discussions on structural barriers produced 
little progress both sides must produce an interim report by 
midapril and a final report before the sevennation economic 
summit to be held this year in houston in july 
the structural impediments discussions are just one of a set of 
trade negotiations currently underway with japan the japanese are 
facing a june 16 deadline to open up markets in three specific 
product areas satellites supercomputers and lumber or risk

the key index of the tokyo stock exchange took its 
secondlargest plunge ever today as the dollar surged to a 
threeyear high against the japanese yen 
analysts said both markets were shaken by a report in japans 
top financial newspaper that major life insurance companies planned 
to shift funds out of the stock market 
the drop in stock prices helped spark a decline on stock markets 
in new york london and several far eastern cities 
in its lead frontpage story the nihon keizai shimbun newspaper 
said major insurance firms including daiichi mutual life 
insurance co nippon life insurance co and sumitomo mutual life 
insurance co planned to sell largeblocks of shares because the 
ratio of their stock holdings to their total assets was approaching 
the upper limit of 30 percent set by the finance ministry 
the finance ministry and at least one insurer denied the report 
which nevertheless supported market expectations that major 
investors would generally move out of the stock market and into 
bonds said jason james strategist at james capel pacific ltd 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues today shed 
197838 points or 659 percent to 2800207 its second largest 
singleday decline ever 
on friday it lost 104571 points or 337 percent in the 
markets seventh largest singleday decline 
analysts said the decline in the stock market helped push the 
dollar higher and the relative weakness of the yen then pushed 
share prices even lower 
an official at daiichi mutual life insurance said the report 
was misleading because the company planned to buy 800 billion yen 
of stocks in fiscal 1990 after selling 200 billion yens worth of 
shares 
wed reduce our holdings of shares with large losses and those 
we possess in excessive amount many of which will be bank 
shares said kimitoshi hasegawa deputy vice president 
supervising separate account management at daiichi mutual life 
insurance co 
on wall street stock prices declined broadly in response to the 
drop on the japanese market the dow jones industrial average was 
off 1599 to 269122 as of 1130 am est 
in london analysts said the plunge in tokyo and violent riots 
against a new percapita tax sent prices sharply lower at midday 
the financial timesstock exchange 100stock index was 323 points 
or 14 percent lower at 22156 
stock prices closed lower in australia hong kong the 
philippines new zealand south korea and singapore largely in 
reaction to the dismal tokyo performance 
in the tokyo currency market the dollar closed at 15995 yen 
up 230 yen from fridays close of 15765 yen it opened at 15997 
up 232 yen and ranged between 15970 and 16035 
about 30 minutes after trading began the dollar was trading 
between 16010 yen and 16020 yen the first time the currency has 
traded in the 160yen range since december 1986 
people had already taken their positions by the time the 
report was denied and anyway people were expecting the shift away 
from stocks to come sooner or later said kaneo ogino of goldman 
sachs japan corp 
the dollar later fell back on shortcovering ogino said 
the speed and extent of the dollars rise took many market 
players by surprise dealers said 
traders were looking at 16040 yen as a medium term objective 
over the next few weeks many people were surprised when we reached 
the target today said mahiko nagai an assistant vice president 
of foreign exchange with manufacturers hanover in tokyo 
dealers predicted volatile trading this week ahead of a meeting 
of finance ministers and central bankers from the group of seven 
leading industrial nations in paris on saturday

structural impediments to trade could push the us currency

weeks to issue an interim report on the talks aimed at identifying

billion us trade deficit with japan

an index measuring the typical american 
familys ability to buy a house increased in february as lower 
prices and rising income offset higher mortgage rates a real 
estate trade group said monday 
the national association of realtors said its index rose to 
1051 in february meaning that a family with a median income of 
33816 had 1051 percent of the income needed to buy a 
medianpriced existing home costing 95400 
the median means half of the families earn more and half less 
or that half of the houses sell for more and half for less 
the index measured 1082 in december but slipped to 1042 in 
january 
the february increase in overall affordability conditions in 
part reflects the lowerpriced homes frequently available during 
the winter months said nar president norman d flynn 
although the lower median home price and rise in family income 
last month had a favorable impact on affordability conditions the 
index would have been stronger if mortgage interest rates had 
remained unchanged he added 
the median price for a house dropped 900 from januarys 96300 
while median family income was up 108 from 33708 the previous 
month the realtors group said the income needed to qualify for a 
loan on the typical home dropped 192 to 32160 
the interest rate used to compute the index however rose from 
97 percent in january to 1004 percent in february the realtors 
said the association uses a composite rate reflecting both 
fixedrate and adjustablerate mortgages 
the changes lowered the monthly principal and interest payment 
on a medianpriced home by 2 to 672 in february the payment 
represents 238 percent of the median familys income 
flynn said that while overall affordability remains favorable 
entrylevel buyers face difficulties 
these individuals are at a disadvantage in that they often 
cant save enough money for a downpayment and lack any home equity 
buildup to leverage a home purchase he said 
under februarys affordability conditions a family earning 
20000 would have sufficient income to qualify for a 59300 home 
using a 47400 loan a family earning 30000 would qualify for a 
88900 home with a 71100 loan 
the realtors said a family earning 40000 would have sufficent 
income to qualify for a 118500 home with a 94800 loan and a 
family with a 50000 income would qualify for a 148100 home 
using a 118500 loan

spending on residential nonresidential and 
government construction projects all increased in february the 
government said monday helped for the second straight month by 
mild weather over much of the country 
the commerce department said construction spending rose 26 
percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4365 billion 
that followed a revised 25 percent jump in january which first 
had been reported to have been a 18 percent gain 
spending in december the fourth coldest on record had slipped 
03 percent and analysts attributed the subsequent improvement to 
warm temperatures 
warm weather certainly is helping said steven cochran an 
economist with wefa group in bala cynwyd pa if it had been 
cold we wouldnt have seen these figures im sure 
but david berson chief economist with the federal national 
mortgage association in washington said construction spending 
began to lose its seasonal benefit in march 
we expect it to start leveling off if not decline because it 
will no longer have the seasonal boost and also because of 
increasing interest rates berson said 
residential construction spending rose 17 percent in february 
to a 1985 billion annual rate after gaining 29 percent in 
january 
singlefamily spending was up 39 percent to 1230 to 210 billion 
after a 55 percent decline in january 
the weather effect was very strong in the singlefamily 
market said david seiders chief economist with the national 
association of home builders but we expect housing starts to 
tail off in the next few months 
singlefamily construction has been on a brief rebound after 
sliding throughout most of 1989 seiders added we do not 
expect it to show a longerterm rebound over the year though 
were looking for it to fall back again 
nonresidential construction increased 55 percent to 1064 
billion after a 61 percent gain in january industrial office and 
other commercial building led the advance 
a lot of the industrial construction was on the west coast 
seiders said not smokestack stuff but hightech facilities 
office building is basically still on a downswing despite its 
february gain 
the government sector which often is volatile more than offset 
its 20 percent january decline rising 21 percent in february to 
4938 billion schools and other public buildings and highways and 
streets were the biggest gainers 
the total construction spending figure was up 48 percent from 
the level of building a year earlier

the us industrial sector remained weak in 
march but declined at its slowest rate since june a possible 
indication that the overall economy may be poised for a pickup 
according to a survey of the nations purchasing managers released 
monday 
the national association of purchasing management which tracks 
economic trends by polling its members said its overall index rose 
to 488 percent in march from 483 percent the previous month 
a reading below 50 indicates the manufacturing economy generally 
is declining above 50 that it generally is expanding 
the march index represented the 11th consecutive monthly decline 
but was at its highest level since junes 488 percent reading due 
to an increase in production and new export orders the tempe 
arizbased trade group said in its report 
with the exception of january the purchasing managers index 
has risen gradually every month since november leading some 
economists to speculate the economy may have bottomed out 
its not so much the economy is getting strong but somewhat 
steadier said robert a brusca chief financial economist for 
nikko securities co international the report raises speculation 
that the worst of the declining phase is behind us the 
question remains how strong and sustainable the statistical rebound 
is 
robert j bretz chairman of the purchasing managers business 
survey committee said the slight increase in the index may be 
signaling a levelingoff in the 11month decline in the economy 
the continued easing in the pace of the economic decline as we 
exit the first quarter is encouraging said bretz who also is 
director of materials management at stamford connbased pitney 
bowes inc 
although we may be forming a bottom caution should be 
exercised since the first robin never makes it a spring 
maury harris chief economist for painewebber inc said that 
although manufacturing makes up a large portion of the nations 
gross national product there are other areas that remain sluggish 
the construction industry is getting ready to tumble he 
said 
a report released monday by the commerce department said 
construction spending rose 26 percent in february compared with a 
revised 25 percent gain in january 
harris attributed the increase solely to unusually warm weather 
across much of the nation and said the industrys overall 
fundamentals were poor 
the production portion of the purchasing managers survey 
increased for the second consecutive month during march it rose to 
an 11month high of 544 percent from 515 percent in february 
new orders grew slightly in march but at a slower pace than in 
february when they increased for the first time since mid1989 
the new orders index stood at 504 percent down from 518 percent 
new export orders also rose the group said the seasonally 
unadjusted new export orders index was 595 percent up from 530 
percent and the highest level since september 1989 
imports increased for the third consecutive month the number of 
members importing in march inched up to 78 percent from 77 percent 
the group said 
but the employment portion of the survey declined for the 13th 
consecutive month with the index falling to 452 percent from 467 
percent members continued to report layoffs hiring freezes and 
early retirement programs to reduce employment 
supplier deliveries were faster for the 11th consecutive month 
the group said most commodities were in supply with the exception 
of bearings electric motors and some chemicals it said 
meanwhile prices of goods fell for the 10th consecutive month 
although the pace of decline was lower than in february 
the purchasing managers report is based on a monthly survey of 
purchasing executives at over 300 industrial companies most of the 
figures are adjusted for seasonal factors

fleetnorstar financial group said 
monday it expects its nonperforming loans to increase by at least 
200 million in the first quarter making it the latest bank to be 
hit by new englands sagging economy 
the company said its level of nonperforming loans would reach 
at least 600 million and could go higher as a result of an 
examination now being conducted by federal regulators 
we have not estimated what the reserve might be or what the 
earnings might be said robert w lougee jr a fleet spokesman 
he said the companys firstquarter earnings report could be 
delayed past the april 18 annual meeting depending on the outcome 
of the examination 
fleet also said it would sell about half of its credit card 
portfolio of about 500 million to norwest corp of minneapolis 
the sale and a change in investments for the corporations pension 
plan is expected to produce a onetime gain of 90 million before 
taxes for the first quarter fleet said 
a 600 million level of nonperforming loans would amount to 
about 26 percent of fleets loan and lease portfolio of about 
225 billion that still is lower than the industry average of 
about 3 percent lougee said 
the bad loans had been identified largely on our own and not 
at the insistence of federal regulators lougee said although 
were clearly aware the regulators are here 
fleet has been praised for its diversification with almost 
twothirds of its assets outside of new england and for steering 
clear of much of the overbuilt condominium market which rapidly 
collapsed during the past year 
but other segments of commercial real estate have clearly 
been affected lougee said including office parks and small 
shopping centers 
the bad loans are spread out in the commercial real estate 
portfolio he said 
according to fleets firstquarter filing with the securities 
and exchange commission about 84 billion of its loan portfolio 
is in commercial and industrial loans and loans to other financial 
institutions

factors

fridays annual agriculture department report on spring planting 
intentions indicated us farmers plan to increase corn acreage by

levels 
the market had expected the report to project a larger increase 
in corn plantings a bigger drop in soybean acreage and a smaller 
decline in spring wheat seedings 
sessionlong weakness in the soybean market stemmed from the 
report and from signs of an increase in brazilian soybean 
harvesting and exports said anne frick senior oilseed analyst

broke some technical chart points and that started the

most pork futures prices rose their permitted daily limits 
monday on the chicago mercantile exchange following a government 
report that indicated 1990 hog production will continue to lag 
behind last years 
on other commodity markets cattle futures advanced soybean 
futures fell sharply while grains were mixed oil futures gained 
and precious metals retreated slightly 
live hog futures settled 87 cent to the limit 15 cents higher 
with the contract for delivery in april up 87 cent at 5427 cents 
a pound frozen pork bellies were 198 cents to the limit 2 cents 
higher with may at 5557 cents a pound 
in cattle trading live cattle were 38 cent to 73 cent higher 
with april at 7860 cents a pound feeder cattle were 17 cent to 
48 cent higher with april at 8262 cents a pound 
analysts said the strong rally in pork futures was rooted in the 
agriculture departments hogsandpigs inventory a quarterly tally 
of the nations hog herd 
released friday after trading ended the report said the hog 
herd as of march 1 was 4 percent smaller than on the same date a 
year earlier the market had expected a decline of closer to 26 
percent 
the governments estimate of the number of animals kept by 
producers for breeding purposes during the decemberfebruary 
quarter was also below market expectations 
the report suggested pork producers remain cautious about 
expanding their herds despite higher hog prices and that the 1990 
us hog herd will remain smaller than last years all year long 
whether you choose to believe that or not is another question 
but thats what the report said said chuck levitt senior 
livestock analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc 
the heaviest buying of pork futures occurred in contracts for 
delivery next fall and winter buying interest spread to the 
nearmonth contracts as the backmonth contracts reached their 
daily limits 
tom morgan president of sterling research corp said the 
market might stage a partial retreat after the sudden runup but he 
said the bullish attitudes that have driven hog prices steadily 
higher since early february remain in place 
theres a large group of people out there who think were 
going to see 60 per hundredweight hogs this summer and maybe 
this report gave them the confidence to push their positions he 
said 
soybean futures fell sharply on the chicago board of trade in a 
late selloff rooted in a government crop report and spurred on by 
bearish technical market factors grain futures ended mixed 
fridays annual agriculture department report on spring planting 
intentions indicated us farmers plan to increase corn acreage by 
about 35 percent this year while decreasing soybean acreage by 2 
percent and spring wheat acreage by 4 percent from last years 
levels

in corn plantings a bigger drop in soybean acreage and a smaller 
decline in spring wheat seedings 
wheat futures settled 2 cents lower to 4 cents higher with may 
at 355 a bushel corn was 2 cents to 4 cents higher with may at

dreyers grand ice cream inc said monday it has 
developed a cholesterolfree frozen dessert that it touts as tasing 
like premium ice cream but having only a fraction of the fat and 
onethird fewer calories 
the product called american dream contains less than 1 percent 
fat and 80 calories per threeounce serving the oakland 
califbased food company said 
that compares with 16 percent fat 30 milligrams of cholesterol 
and 120 calories in three ounces of typical premium ice cream the 
company said 
dreyers said it was able to reduce the fat and eliminate 
cholesterol in american dream through a proprietary technology that 
concentrates protein and enables us to use all the same dairy 
ingredients found in ice cream 
that distinguishes it from monsanto cos simple pleasures a 
recently introduced frozen dessert that uses the fat substitute 
simplesse which is made from egg whites and milk protein 
t gary rogers chairman and chief executive of dreyers said 
in a telephone interview that american dream should attract people 
who have been avoiding ice cream because of its fat and cholesterol 
content 
he said it will also enable ice cream eaters to consume more of 
this type of dessert without worrying about cholesterol which is 
believed to contribute to heart and arterial diseases 
in national overthecounter trading dreyers rose 25 cents a 
share to 3275 
rogers said dreyers has used its protein concentration process 
for its light frozen dessert and yogurt products he said that 
although the process is not patented others have been unable to 
duplicate it 
joseph arsenio an analyst who follows dreyers for the 
investment firm hambrecht amp quist in san francisco said his firm 
was enthusiastic about the new product 
it should appeal to an audience that is very cholesterol as 
well as fat conscious he said 
the company plans to sell the dessert in nine flavors and make 
it available in quarts and half gallons rather than the pint sizes 
used for superpremium ice creams it will be priced comparably with 
premium ice cream or about 230 for a quart and 4 for a 
halfgallon the company said 
american dream should reach stores within six to eight weeks 
rogers said 
dreyers said it is the nations thirdlargest ice cream and 
frozen dessert maker with sales of 227 million in 1989 
industrywide sales amounted to 93 billion last year according to 
the international ice cream association trade group 
dreyers makes and distributes its premium ice cream under the 
name dreyers grand in the west and edys grand east of the 
rockies it also makes grand light a frozen dessert with 7 percent 
fat and frozen yogurt inspirations with 3 pecent fat 
rogers said dreyers will spend 24 million marketing all of its 
products this year up from 18 million in 1989

torchmark corp withdrew a 64 billion bid for 
american general corp monday a week after proposing the buyout 
choosing instead to work to elect its own nominees to american 
generals board of directors 
the birmingham alabased insurance and financial services 
company said it decided to withdraw the offer for the much larger 
american general because it never received a response to its 
proposal 
torchmark had sent a letter informing american general of the 
offer last march 26 saying the houstonbased insurance and 
financial services company had two days to give an answer 
since no response was forthcoming the proposal was 
withdrawn torchmark said monday adding that american general 
had refused to meet to discuss the bid 
american general has only said it was reviewing the bid and that 
directors would discuss it at their next regular meeting may 2 the 
day of the companys annual shareholders meeting 
torchmark had proposed to buy about half of american generals 
1267 million outstanding shares of common stock for 50 a share 
and to exchange 50 worth of torchmark common stock for each of the 
remaining shares the company had said the offer was negotiable 
but torchmark also said it would propose a slate of five 
independent nominees for the american general board at the may 2 
meeting three board members are up for reelection and three seats 
are up for election 
independent nominees when elected will be committed to 
independently assessing whether or not a business combination of 
american general would be in the shareholders best interest 
torchmark said in a statement monday 
american general issued a statement saying it has rejected 
torchmarks attempt to propose its own slate of directors because 
it was past the companys march 3 deadline for nominations 
american general has filed a lawsuit in federal court asking a 
judge to uphold its bylaws and prohibit torchmark from soliciting 
proxies in an effort to elect its own slate of directors a hearing 
date on the lawsuit has not been set 
torchmark also said it would propose a resolution at the meeting 
calling on the board to appoint a committee of independent 
directors to evaluate all acquisition proposals and to hire an 
investment banking firm to solicit offers 
we made a generous proposal to consolidate with american 
general at a 59 percent premium over market price for american 
general shareholders torchmark president john t rotenstreich 
said monday 
american general said that its board would not consider our 
proposal until after its annual meeting on may 2 so the annual 
meeting has become a referendum on whether shareholders want the 
board to seriously consider proposals like ours he said 
he said torchmark intends to make another proposal only if 
shareholders express support for a merger by electing the 
independent nominees or voting in favor of the resolution 
at the end of 1989 american generals total assets were 321 
billion and common shareholders equity was 41 billion torchmark 
reported total assets as of dec 31 of 49 billion and common 
shareholders equity of 795 million

csx corp on monday reported its 
firstquarter earnings slipped marginally as a onetime gain from 
the sale of its natural gas processing operation was offset by 
increased expenses and a restructuring program 
the railroad and natural resources company reported a profit of 
77 million or 76 cents a share compared with earnings of 82 
million or 74 cents a share during the same period last year 
during the quarter csx sold its csx energy corp to enron 
corp resulting in an aftertax gain of 52 million the gain was 
partially offset by a 33 million aftertax expense from the 
restructuring of sealand service inc csxs containershipping 
subsidiary 
according to csx rail operating income declined to 155 million 
from 158 million a year ago despite increased revenue which rose 
23 million to 13 billion from the first three months of 1989 
strong coal grain and fertilizer traffic more than offset 
weaknesses in the automotive and metals sectors which dropped 24 
percent and 7 percent respectively csx said 
but rising diesel fuel prices helped boost rail expenses by 26 
million to 11 billon also contributing to the higher rail 
expenses were an expanded locomotive repair program and costs 
associated with flooding in the south

the eastern airlines pilots union voted heavily in 
favor of a temporary contract that makes steep concessions the 
union said monday 
it was an overwhelming approval said dan ashby a spokesman 
for the air line pilots association he said final figures hadnt 
been tallied for the secret weekend balloting at union offices in 
six cities 
the sixmonth agreement retroactive to march 1 gives working 
union pilots 25 percent pay cuts increased health insurance 
contributions continuation of increased work hours imposed because 
of the unions strike and reduces easterns contributions to the 
employees retirement funds 
the concessions were part of easterns plan for emerging from 
chapter 11 bankruptcy protection the airline faces mounting 
skepticism from unsecured creditors who last week discussed 
calling for liquidation after eastern said it couldnt repay them 
50 cents on the dollar as agreed earlier 
once again the eastern pilots are offering to help ashby 
said this vote by no means says there is labor peace on the 
property we are very concerned about the future 
the two sides are in federally mediated talks on a permanent 
agreement 
the pilots say theyre willing to make concessions but eastern 
management must commit to hire more pilots back and to making 
miamibased eastern viable 
this concessionary agreement will not save eastern airlines 
its just a drop in the bucket ashby said 
eastern has some 1800 pilots more than half hired after the 
pilots union walked out march 4 1989 in sympathy with the 
striking machinists union the machinists remain on strike while 
the pilots and flight attendants called their strikes off last 
november 
eastern has been slow to return strikers to work saying it has 
no openings 
the newly hired pilots whose jobs are under court challenge 
from the pilots union wont have their salaries cut under the 
temporary agreement 
the union would like eastern to hire back 1500 more union 
pilots 
eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak said the airline hadnt been 
informed by the union of its vote 
we still have a long way to go on reaching a permanent 
agreement ms ceremsak said right now there are no more 
talks scheduled and were waiting to hear from the national 
mediation board 
separately monday eastern and delta air lines said they settled 
claims relating to normal business and ticketing transactions prior 
to easterns bankruptcy filing on march 9 1989 eastern agreed to 
pay 168 million in cash plus interest to atlantabased delta 
as a result eastern and delta will renew their cooperative 
ticketing and baggage agreement

federated department stores inc and allied 
stores corp on monday reported a combined operating loss of 457 
million in february and said that was an improvement over results 
for late january after they filed for bankruptcy protection 
we view february results as reflecting the stabilization of 
our department store operations in the postfiling period 
spokeswoman carol sanger said in a statement 
the cincinnatibased companies filed for chapter 11 protection 
from creditors under the federal bankruptcy code on jan 15 
federated lost 298 million in february and allied lost 158 
million the sister companies owned by torontobased campeau 
corp together operate 260 stores and employ 100000 people in 28 
states 
the latest results showed increased sales of apparel shoes 
fashion and home accessories the companies said sales of 
electronic goods and furniture lagged however partly because of 
some inventory shortfalls and resulting delays of promotions they 
said 
endofmonth inventories were similar to those of a year 
earlier the companies said vendors supplies of merchandise to 
federated and allied have nearly returned to normal levels the 
companies said 
the results were made available to us trustee conrad j 
morgenstern whose office is assisting us bankruptcy judge j 
vincent aug jr in overseeing the companies operations during 
bankruptcy reorganization 
the companies on jan 15 listed debts totaling 77 billion 
mainly acquired in campeaus purchases of allied in 1986 and

the manville property damage settlement trust has 
completed a review of 14000 claims for asbestos exposure and has 
paid 68 million to some of the claimants the trust announced 
monday 
the trust based in white plains ny said in a news statement 
it also has set aside 28 million for settling other claims and 
expects an additional 200 million to be available for distribution 
over the next three years 
the trust was established in 1988 as part of a reorganization of 
denverbsaed manville corp by the us bankruptcy court of the 
southern district of new york 
more than 3000 claimants have submitted claims so far and the 
largest 50 will receive over 25 percent of the money the largest 
200 claimants will receive over 45 percent according to the trust 
of the 13 billion claimed no more than 280 million or 21 
percent can be reimbursed 
the fund was established to resolve millions of dollars in 
damage claims against manville stemming from its days as the 
nations largest asbestos producer 
the company was forced to file for protection from creditors in 
1982 as a result of asbestosrelated lawsuits it emerged from that 
protection in 1988 
among the largest claimants seeking more than 2 million are 
the city of new york united states steel corp the state of 
massachusetts the state of illinois the state of new york and 
the state of texas 
kurt h schaffir the trusts executive director said the trust 
is limited on how much of the final settlement on any claim can be 
paid and how much of this can be distributed at any point in time 
reimbursements are limited to fixed percentages for different 
categories but trust officials say people should still continue to 
file if they think they have a claim 
the rate at which claims are being received has tapered off 
considerably and it is quite possible that sufficient funds will 
be available over the next three years to pay half or more of the 
maximum payable amounts we believe that it continues to be very 
much worthwhile for eligible claimants to file new claims 
schaffir said

senate republican leader bob dole predicted 
monday that t timothy ryan jr will be approved by the senate 
despite ryans acknowledgement that he used marijuana and cocaine 
in the 1970s 
in my view the nominee will be confirmed the kansas 
senator said as republicans pushed for a quick senate floor vote 
the question will be on whether he has the experience 
dole asked for a vote this week on the nomination of ryan a 
former solicitor in the labor department who is president bushs 
choice to head the treasury departments office of thrift 
supervision 
dole and treasury secretary nicholas f brady huddled over the 
weekend on how to minimize the damage from the disclosure friday 
that ryan had acknowledged to the fbi and bush administration 
officials that in the 1970s he had used marijuana occasionally and 
had tried cocaine once perhaps twice 
ryan 44 survived a 1110 confirmation vote in the senate 
banking committee thursday that vote came after he acknowledged 
during hearings that he has little experience with banking or 
thrifts 
on monday night sen john warner rva rose on the floor of 
the senate to defend ryan saying he had known the lawyer for 
several years and had confidence in ryans integrity 
i dont think theres any question of the mans honesty or of 
his effectiveness warner said noting that ryan brought the past 
drug use to the attention of investigators conducting a background 
check on him 
mr ryan when approached by the presidents staff disclosed 
certain facts which now have been brought out in the press 
warner said he said the nominee was up front and in an honest 
way he gave all that information to the fbi 
warner said ryan made a mistake in trying drugs but his error 
should be placed in the context of the vietnam war generation 
no matter how serious the mistake was it seems to me that 
that generation was subjected to a most unusual period of 
history warner said each person should be judged individually 
warner said adding that ryan was never tempted to use drugs after 
that limited experience 
warner said members of the banking committee had access to the 
fbi background report including the detailing of past drug use by 
ryans own admission and still voted to favorably recommend his 
confirmation 
senate banking committee chairman donald w riegle jr dmich 
had said last friday mr ryan clearly lacks the necessary 
professional qualifications for what is the single most complex and 
important financial job in our country today hundreds of billions 
of dollars are at stake 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine would not 
venture an opinion monday on how the substance abuse issue will 
affect the vote the vote on the nomination could come as early 
as wednesday he said 
thats a matter for each senator mitchell said i think 
there is widespread concern about the thoroughness of his 
qualifications for such an important job 
rep frank annunzio dill and chairman of the house banking 
committees financial institutions subcommittee questioned how 
bush could nominate an acknowledged former drug user 
the man admitted he was on cocaine he admitted he was on 
marijuana annunzio said whats that say to children youre 
telling to just say no he sure puts a crimp on the war on 
drugs 
the 21member senate banking committee had access to the fbi 
files but ryans drug use was not raised during his confirmation 
hearings 
after the disclosure by nbc news friday night riegle condemned 
the release of the fbi material as improper and brady said ryans 
drug incidents were limited and a long time ago 
the white house also defended ryan with spokesman marlin 
fitzwater saying we knew about it beforehand we felt it was not 
relevant

regulatory limits 
daiichi told a midday news conference that it would continue 
to buy stocks during its current fiscal year but the report 
already had shaken the markets 
the big life insurers are the markets most conservative 
longterm and richest investors the report saying massive selling 
was likely scared off potential buyers said christopher 
leighton manager of international sales at schroder securities 
japan ltd 
although finance ministry officials and daiichi denied the 
report it reaffirmed market expectations of a general shift by 
major investors out of the stock market said jason james 
strategist at james capel pacific ltd 
the initial price declines snowballed amid rapid brokerage 
selling for individuals who needed cash to meet margin calls and on 
profittaking by investors highpriced electrical company shares 
traders said 
also weakening the stock market was the continued decline of the 
yen which is seen as worsening inflation prospects and chasing 
japanese investment funds to ovrseas markets

fridays close and at one point traded above 160 yen for the first

followed a 337 percent drop in the nikkei average during fridays 
session 
stocks fell sharply on londons stock exchange where investors 
also were concerned about political turmoil related to a new tax 
however the financial timesstock exchange 100share index 
rebounded from its lows to finish 263 points lower at 22216 
on wall street stocks declined broadly but finished above their 
lows the dow jones average of 30 industrials down more than 20 
points at one time finished off 676 at 270045 in the broader

group of seven industrial nations 
concern over the outcome of usjapan trade talks in washington 
also could push the dollar higher analysts said

cashstrapped general development corp has skipped 
more than 10 million in property tax payments and is considering 
filing for bankruptcy protection the company said monday 
property tax payments on the nine florida communities built by 
the indicted developer had to be postmarked by sunday but none 
were sent said company spokesman otis wragg 
there are some other payments that are due he said there 
are of course some grace periods that are involved but i cant 
give you a list of them 
the miamibased developer pleaded guilty last month in federal 
court to mailfraud conspiracy for overpricing homes by the 
thousands and deceiving the buyers about their true values 
general development has been seeking 60 million in interim 
credit for three weeks but talks broke off last weekend without 
agreement leading to the announcement that a bankruptcy filing was 
being considered 
we felt obliged to make known to the public that this was one 
of the options that we are considering wragg said however we 
have not made a decision to file for protection and i cannot 
speculate as to whether that might be a decision 
general development told the securities and exchange commmission 
earlier that it would cost about 400 million to finish developing 
its land but only 1021 million has been budgeted for 
improvements 
failure to pay property taxes triggers a twoyear legal process 
that could end with the sale of the land but general development 
could avoid that by paying the taxes interest and penalties at any 
time up to the day of sale 
i dont foresee them losing any property unless they go 
kerflooey and close up said gene morris the tax collector for 
indian river county 
general development owes 709672 in property taxes or 08 
percent of the county tax roll on about 2800 vacant parcels and 
sewer and water plants he said 
in brevard county where general development owns 18000 empty 
lots tax collector cn newt jones was more worried about the 
paperwork nightmare that a tax sale might cause the county 
normally lists about 11000 items for its annual tax sale 
the company owes more than 2 million in property taxes or 
about 1 percent of brevards annual collections jones said 
united capital corp a minority shareholder offered shortterm 
operating funds and a restructuring plan involving the sales of 
assets last week 
but the new yorkbased real estate company which plans to 
submit a slate of new gdc board nominees that include united 
capitals chairman announced monday that talks had broken down 
the talks ended after united capital rejected a proposal that 
would have involved immediately dropping its plan to nominate new 
directors before negotiations on a possible financial transaction 
would begin united capital said in a statement 
general developments board seems more intent on keeping 
control even if they had to take general develoment into 
bankruptcy af petrocelli chairman of united capital said in 
a statement
