a former top navy contracting official says 
that as a private consultant he paid other consultants for 
technical information on contracts but denies he paid 
government employees 
william parkin who is at the center of the ongoing pentagon 
fraud investigation said he began making monthly payments to 
consultant fred lackner in late 1986 for information on a pending 
navy contract for special aircraft equipment 
parkin who retired from the navy in 1983 to set up his own 
consulting firm said he paid lackner between 15000 and 18000 
and that he then provided the contract information to his client 
hazeltine corp of greeenlawn ny on long island 
i will say it wasnt secret material parkin said in a 
telephone interview friday with the associated press it was 
technical information 
a hazeltine official speaking for the company on condition of 
anonymity said hazeltine had been assured by investigators that 
neither it nor any current or former employee is a target of the 
investigation and has no knowledge of parkin acquiring any 
information unlawfully 
hazeltine was aware that parkin worked with other consultants 
but was not generally aware of the identity of those consultants 
the official continued and specifically hazeltine was not aware 
that fred lackner was one of them lackner has never worked as a 
consultant to hazeltine 
the official said there was a standard clause in parkins 
contract with hazeltine obligating him not to obtain inside 
information by bribery 
the justice department has asserted in an affidavit for a search 
warrant that wiretapped conversations showed parkin served as a 
middleman who paid government employees for inside information and 
sold it to contractors 
i deny vehemently that i made payoffs to government 
officials parkin was quoted as telling the wall street journal 
in an article published friday i bought information from 
consultant lackner and passed it to hazeltine that is where i 
made an error 
parkin is the second consultant this week to describe an 
informal and extensive network of consultants government officials 
and defense contractors whose interests in passing information 
often meshed 
thomas muldoon another consultant who like parkin was named 
in federal search warrants in june was quoted by the hartford 
courant in connecticut on sunday as saying he never asked about the 
sources of sensitive information he received from other consultants 
and neither did the companies to which he passed it 
companies never ask you where you get the information 
muldoon said there was never any doubt what i was being paid 
for 
parkin 64 of alexandria va first described his work as a 
middleman in the defense industry during a series of interviews 
with the journal which described him as one of the navys most 
powerful contracting officers from 1966 to 1983 
parkin was hired by hazeltine in 1986 to help win navy work on 
test equipment for systems that distinguish between friendly and 
hostile aircraft he was paid about 36000 by the company over a 
1year period 
parkin told the journal his role was only to serve as a 
front for lackner now a california defense consultant who also 
was the object of an fbi search warrant earlier this summer 
parkin said lackner obtained the confidential information and 
that he then passed it on without lackner ever disclosing how he 
got it 
the information tells ahead of time what would be in the 
request for proposals advance information so they hazeltine 
could start a proposal parkin said 
lackner was quoted by the journal as saying the information he 
gave parkin was not inside information he also told the paper he 
had obtained information in the past from stuart berlin currently 
a navy executive and another figure in the investigation but said 
it was public knowledge 
parkin also disclosed a lengthy list of dealings with various 
consultants and others who now figure in the procurement fraud 
investigation 
among those dealings were loans to an air force official whose 
office was searched by the fbi and joint investments with william 
galvin a defense consultant identified as a key figure in the 
probe 
the justice department investigation which became public in 
june centers on allegations that defense contractors routinely 
used outside consultants to obtain proprietary information on the 
bids of competitors and that the consultants may have paid bribes 
to pentagon employees

confident about ourselves we have great artists a great 
audience here and i think the greatest cause in the world 
the crowd at wembley was made up mainly youngsters attracted by 
the big stars they are the generation to whom amnesty is making a 
special appeal to back the human rights declaration which is 
widely endorsed but frequently ignored by governments 
springsteen shares a bill for the entire tour with british stars

senegals youssou ndour

stir the consciences of the young people in the cause of human 
rights amnesty hopes the tour will break even 
thousands of fans signed slips of paper endorsing the human 
rights declaration 
amnesty officials plan to hand over the signatures at the un 
headquarters in new york at the end of the tour

its also a very good cause ricky mccabe a 21yearold chef 
told the associated press after signing the declaration 
ticket prices vary between rich and poor countries 3760 in

abuses particularly the plight of political prisoners around the

healey is still trying to get the kremlin to agree to a show in 
moscow 
i am hopeful that negotiations dont break down on our side or 
on theirs healey said we are very anxious to play in the 
other superpower

capital of zimbabwe whose government reacted angrily to amnesty 
reports several years ago of brutal suppression of the minority 
ndebele tribe the date for harare is oct 7 after what healey 
called a careful negotiation

michael dukakis with his trusted but longabsent democratic 
campaign general reporting back for duty predicts a battle royal 
for the presidency gop nominee george bush firing a shot on the 
cleanwater front vows to fight to ban ocean dumping forever 
john sasso a top dukakis aide who quit last year in an uproar 
over the attack video that helped destroy delaware sen joseph 
bidens campaign for the democratic presidential nomination 
rejoined the massachusetts governors high command friday in an 
attempt to help dukakis beat bush on election day 
while campaigning in california dukakis told reporters that 
sasso had paid the price for having made a very serious 
mistake in the biden video episode it will be a battle royal 
for the presidency of the united states dukakis added decaring 
he wants his warriors to be the strongest team i possibly can 
assemble 
bush standing friday on a new jersey beach that has been closed 
at times because sludge washed ashore after having been dumped off 
the coast continued blasting dukakis on the environment 
for almost two years he fought to allow bostons sludge to be 
dumped off new jerseys shore the very shore on which he had the 
nerve to stand and promise clean water bush said nice guy 
yeah he added sarcastically and asked why did you pledge a 
clean ocean to the people of new jersey when your own state applied 
to pollute it 
while dukakis applied in 1985 to have massachusetts waste 
dumped 106 miles off new jerseys coast a later agreement allowed 
massachusetts to unload it out beyond the continental shelf 
bush said he would fight to ban ocean dumping forever and 
would make the enforcement of superfund the prosecution of 
polluters and the cleanup of toxic waste a top priority 
meantime bush avoided reporters questions about sassos 
return saying at one point i havent thought about it 
sasso left the dukakis camp after admitting circulating a 
videotape showing biden borrowing a british politicians words 
while failing to give attribution on friday he apologized for the 
incident and said he had not intended to raise questions about 
bidens character 
bidens presidential campaign was born in june 1987 and died in 
september of that year after being hit by admissions of plagiarism 
and false claims about his academic achievements in quitting the 
race for the democratic nomination eventually won by dukakis biden 
said the exaggerated shadow of his mistakes made it impossible 
for him to continue 
on friday dukakis said biden could not have been more 
gracious when told sasso was returning biden issued a statement 
saying i continue to support governor dukakis 
elsewhere along the campaign trail 
dukakis in portland ore ridiculed the idea of dan quayle 
the indiana senator who is bushs vice presidential running mate 
heading the war on drugs 
noting bush had said he would put his vice president in charge 
of the war on drugs dukakis said ronald reagan tried that and 
it failed 
is there anybody here today dukakis asked is there any 
citizen in the united states of america who thinks that dan quayle 
is qualified to be the nations drug czar 
quayle in montgomery ala accused dukakis of being flat 
wrong on defense and foreign policy matters 
we believe in a strong national defense to deter aggression 
against america and he does not said quayle adding on 
matters of national defense and foreign policy believe me our 
opponent is not even half right hes just flat wrong 
in washington quayles office released a doctors report 
showing the candidate in excellent health and that he suffers only 
from slightly high cholesterol levels and minor skin and nasal 
problems 
dr robert krasner senior assistant attending physician at the 
us capitol said quayles marginally elevated cholesterol 
level can be reduced by proper diet and exercise he said quayle 
suffers from a minor nose bleeding problem and an unspecified 
seasonal allergy that causes nasal swelling for which he uses a 
nasal spray

chinas leading daily said today that poor 
service on the staterun airline brings shame to the country and 
its ongoing reforms 
the peoples daily criticism of the civil aviation 
administration of china came three days after a caac jetliner 
skidded off the runway at hong kongs airport and crashed into the 
harbor killing six crew members and one passenger 
it was caacs second fatal accident this year in january a 
caac jet crashed near the southwestern city of chungking killing 
all 108 people aboard 
the newspaper did not mention the accidents concentrating on 
the deeprooted problems in service 
all caac employees from leaders to ordinary staff members 
should feel ashamed they should try hard to improve the situation 
as quickly as possible if they have an iota of national 
selfrespect it said 
the daily official voice of the communist party said in one 
instance the destination of a scheduled flight out of canton in the 
south was suddenly changed to chengdu in the southwest without 
notifying the passengers in advance 
the beijing office of a foreign company wrote four letters to 
book tickets without getting a response it said if this service 
is not poor what is 
caac passengers also complain of frequent flight delays and 
cancellations poor food and the refusal of caac employees to say 
when a delayed flight will leave the report said 
the daily said caac which in recent years has initiated a 
program of decentralization to make its operations more efficient 
is finally acknowledging the need for improvement 
admitting backwardness means that caac is waking up to the 
realities it said

defense minister humberto ortega 
said nicaragua has defeated usbacked rebels but will maintain 
its large army because of the threat of an invasion by american 
troops 
ortega said friday the rebels are strategically defeated but 
the government will not reduce it 80000member armed forces the 
biggest in central america 
we cant have a lesser level he said citing the presence 
of rebel units across the border in honduras and what he called the 
threat of us military intervention 
a contra director meanwhile said that a loss of us support 
for the rebels could mean the blood of american soldiers 
a transcript of a rebel radio liberation broadcast quoted 
enrique bermudez as saying the contras are fighting for democracy 
in central america 
but ortega said the rebels known as contras were in an 
irreversible situation with no hope for victory 
the contras began fighting the leftist government in 1981 the 
sandinistas came to power in july 1979 in the civil war that ousted 
president anastasio somoza after 42 years of rule by the somoza 
family 
ortega spoke with reporters after addressing a crowd of soldiers 
at an army day ceremony in san jacinto 25 miles north of the 
capital of managua 
the defense minister said the rebels still hoped to obtain 
renewed us military aid cut off at the end of february he said 
the reagan administration was attempting to provoke a conflict 
between honduran and nicaraguan troops to justify direct american 
military intervention 
the united states sent more than 3000 soldiers to honduras in 
march in response to a sandinista border crossing into honduras 
but then withdrew the troops 
the sandinistas and the contras signed a ceasefire pact march 
23 but highlevel talks to work out the mechanics of a permanent 
truce in the 7yearold war stalemated in june both sides accuse 
the other of violating the march agreement to suspend offensive 
military operations 
the defense minister said that the sandinistas were ready to 
renew the talks but that they had to be held in managua the 
capital the contras refuse to return to managua saying they were 
barred from circulating freely 
ortega repeated the sandinista governments estimate that there 
are 6000 contras and he said 70 percent of them were in honduras 
rebel officials say more than 10000 combatants are in honduras and 
about 2000 remain in nicaragua

the crew of downed delta flight 1141 
called out that the jets wing flaps were in the proper position 
for takeoff according to cockpit recordings released friday 
adding more confusion to the crash investigation 
national transportation safety board member lee dickinson said 
at a briefing friday night that the statements captured by the 
flight recorder seem to disagree with physical evidence found at 
the scene of wednesdays accident in which 13 people died 
dickinson said the recording clearly indicates someone making a 
pretakeoff call out for flaps and someone responding 15 15 
green light he said that would seem to indicate both flaps were 
shown to be in a matching angle of 15 degrees downward a normal 
takeoff position for a boeing 727 
flight engineer steven judd also told the ntsb team friday that 
he also heard the crews first officer say 15 15 
flaps help provide the lift a plane needs to become airborne 
the delta jetliner crashed as it tried to take off from dallasfort 
worth international airport 
investigators said the flaps in the wreckage appeared to be in 
the up position and the airplanes slats on the wings leading 
edge were found to be partly extended the boeing 727s slats have 
physical locking devices that would have prevented them from 
being knocked far out of place by a crash said bernard loeb 
deputy director of investigations for the ntsb 
officials said they have not determined which voices belong to 
the specific crew members 
another inconsistency investigators noted was no visible sign of 
damage to any of the planes three engines dickinson said they 
will have to wait until the pratt amp whitney power plants are torn 
down at the factory in hartford conn to learn more 
judd told investigators all three engines appeared to be 
operating normally up until the time the nose wheel was lifting off 
8500 to 9000 feet down runway 18l 
judd also said the right wing dipped severely after takeoff 
and capt larry davis tried to correct the situation 
the flight engineer said the plane had a very long wait for 
takeoff and for a time shut down the right engine which was 
separated from the fuselage after the crash 
witness accounts that the engines flared during takeoff could 
indicate compressor stall a phenomenon in which air flow to a 
jet engines compressor is interrupted loeb said but he said such 
a condition could not be confirmed yet 
loeb said he would not care to speculate on what position into 
which a pilot would have to move his flaps if the planes nose 
attitude was too extreme as some witnesses told the ntsb earlier 
the federal officials said they would continue to study the left 
rear emergency door near where many of the victims were found 
loeb said it took more than one person to open the door for the 
first time after the crash but he cautioned that no conclusion 
could be drawn that people may have been trapped inside by a 
troublesome door the angle of the wreckage combined with 
gravitational forces may have made the door difficult to open he 
said 
ninetyfive of the 108 people on board survived most by 
scrambling out of emergency doors over the left wing and a crack 
between the cabin and cockpit of the jet which broke apart and 
burst into flames as it plowed into a field of sunflowers at the 
end of the runway 
investigators thursday discovered an indicator of wing flap 
position was stuck in a position not normal for most takeoffsthey 
found the indicator in the up position opposite of the proper 
setting for takeoff but stressed it could have been jarred during 
the crash or by crew members during evacuation 
the cockpit recording also showed that the shaker stick 
which rattles a planes steering mechanism when a problem develops 
sounded during takeoff investigators said 
the recording also indicated that the crew in the cockpit 
discussed a possible engine problem during the few seconds of the 
flight and pilots in planes waiting on taxiways when flight 1141 
took off reported seeing a white flame or vapor from the planes 
left engine 
friday a forklift picked up the planes right engine which was 
found separated from the fuselage after the crash and placed it on 
a large flatbed truck where it was secured with chains for 
shipment to pratt amp whitney 
the boeing 727 is designed to fly even if one of its three 
engines is out officials have said 
investigators hope the fact that the flights cockpit crew 
survived will help them more easily reconstruct the accident 
the pilot capt larry l davis 48 was in fair condition 
friday at parkland memorial hospital while 1st officer carey 
wilson kirkland jr 37 was in stable condition at northeast 
community hospital at bedford 
john mazor a spokesman for the air line pilots association 
said davis should not be interviewed until he has recovered more 
and is no longer under the influence of painkillers 
what you dont do is take someone out of a smoldering cockpit 
and shove a tape recorder under their nose mazor said the 
account you get is going to be unreliable 
dickinson said blood and urine samples had been taken from the 
crew members shortly after they arrived hospitals wednesday would 
be tested for traces of drugs and alcohol such tests are routine 
after accidents 
as investigators continued studying the wreckage friday more 
attention was placed on the closed emergency exit on the left side 
of the plane toward the back near the galley 
tarrant county medical examiner nizan peerwani said the bodies 
of seven passengers and two flight attendants were found 
literally piled on top of one another in front of an exit door 
that apparently could not be opened 
federal safety investigators and delta officials declined to 
speculate on whether the unopened exit was a factor in the deaths 
but dickinson said ntsb personnel are trying to determine whether 
the door was jammed other exits are also being studied 
bill berry an atlantabased delta spokesman declined to 
speculate on why the victims were unable to open the exit 
ordinarily he said a door on a 727 can be opened manually in 
about two seconds 
the plane carried nearly a score of offduty delta employees 10 
of them flight attendants some passengers said their presence 
contributed to the miraculous number of survivors 
several passengers credited damon berry 37 of sandy utah an 
offduty delta employee on the flight with staying in the burning 
plane to help others 
i cant really say what was going through my mind he said 
you just do it it just seemed like my responsibility to try and 
help as many people as i could

former rep mario biaggi last year owed 
somewhere between 30000 and 100000 according to his federal 
financial disclosure form but thats small change compared with 
the roughly 8 million in fines he faces after two federal 
convictions 
biaggi a democrat who represented part of the bronx and 
yonkers ny in congress for nearly 20 years resigned his seat 
aug 5 after being found guilty of extorting bribes from the 
wedtech corp 
wedtech was a bronx machine shop that grew into a 
multimilliondollar military contractor before being forced into 
bankruptcy 
biaggi also was convicted on other charges including that he 
had filed false financial disclosure statements in the past by 
failing to include the 50000 cash and 3 million in stock he 
allegedly demanded from wedtech in exchange for his clout in 
washington 
biaggi reported income and assets totaling between about 
769000 and 17 million last year on his financial disclosure 
form he listed debts of between 30000 and 100000 in 1987 
members of congress are required to report annually on their 
income and assets but only within broad ranges 
as in recent years biaggis latest disclosure made no mention 
of wedtech stock and included no gifts to the congressman 
his 1987 report which had been due with the clerk of the house 
of representatives on may 15 was not received until aug 18 the 
congressman had been granted three extensions in light of the 
wedtech trial which began in march and ended aug 4 
biaggi continues to maintain his innocence and the verdict is 
under appeal sentencing is scheduled for nov 18 at which time 
the 70yearold excongressman faces up to 146 years in prison and 
7422000 in fines the judge also ordered biaggi to forfeit 
350000 in illgotten gains 
in a separate trial last year biaggi was convicted of accepting 
an illegal gratuity in the form of paid florida vacations he was 
sentenced to 2 years in prison and fined 500000 appeal of that 
case was denied in early august but biaggis attorneys have 
petitioned for a rehearing 
biaggis 1987 income included 7000 in fees from his former law 
firm biaggi and ehrlich for unspecified services biaggi and 
ehrlich also reimbursed the excongressman for an unspecified 
amount of telephone expenses 
biaggi sold his partnership in the firm in 1979 for 320000 to 
be paid over time at 7 percent interest he was supposed to receive 
30000 per year for the period jan 1 1980 through dec 31 
1988 according to his disclosure forms but in 1987 biaggi only 
received between 2501 and 5000 from the agreement 
other members of the firm namely bernard ehrlich and biaggis 
son richard also were defendants in the wedtech trial ehrlich 
was convicted of racketeering and richard biaggi was found guilty 
of bribe receiving mail fraud and tax fraud 
the elder biaggi who was a new york city policeman from 1942 to 
1965 collected 16837 on his police pension last year the form 
also showed 
biaggis stock holdings ranged from more than 505000 to in 
excess of 1 million he also purchased stocks worth between 
20000 and 85000 in 1987 while he sold securities worth between 
10000 and 30000 
the forms are not a very good indicator of net worth however 
members are not required to list holdings such as real estate 
unless it is sold or rented out during the year in question they 
also do not have to report cars boats or other valuable assets

the head of the kgb says foreignsupported 
subversives are attempting to use the freer atmosphere in the 
soviet union to undermine the system 
they try to stimulate the organization of various kinds of 
clandestine semilegal and even legal associations in our country 
which would act at their bidding said victor chebrikov who 
referred to the actions as ideological sabotage 
in a rare glimpse into the soviet secret agency friday 
chebrikov also said his agents caught 20 spies in the past 2 years 
and asserted that superpower intelligence agencies are still waging 
a cold war despite improved eastwest relations 
certain circles of imperialism have not abandoned the course 
toward confrontation said chebrikov head of the committee for 
state security the kgb and a member of the ruling communist 
party politburo 
chebrikov also said in the lengthy interview in the party 
newspaper pravda that officials are in the process of trying to 
define the kgbs role adding that he is working on remolding 
thinking and renouncing stereotypes within the kgbs ranks 
he voiced support for the kremlins policy of glasnost or 
greater openness but said some of the kgbs acts must remain 
secret 
he said the agencys primary goal is to stop 
intelligencegathering and subversive activities by foreign secret 
services as well as hostile actions by antisoviet and 
antisocialistminded persons inside the country 
in what appeared to be his first interview chebrikov 
acknowledged the soviet secret police apparatus has been guilty of 
repression on the domestic front but he gave no details other 
than to mention some former officials of the security agency who 
were killed for resisting repressions under dictator josef stalin 
chebrikov said more than 20000 agents who resisted orders from 
higherups to violate the law fell victim to repressions as a 
result of false charges 
the agency now trains agents to adhere strictly to soviet law 
he said 
chebrikov said the 20 captured spies included kgb officers 
working as double agents he said more than 50 diplomats and 
correspondents from natomember countries were expelled from the 
soviet union in 198687 for activities incompatible with their 
diplomatic status 
chebrikov also reported the discovery of nuclearpowered devices 
to eavesdrop on a soviet underwater telephone cable in the okhotsk 
sea 37 miles off the soviet east coast and north of japan 
the complex was designed for registering during a year all 
information transmitted by the underwater communication cable 
there was also a beacon that helped the american intelligence 
service to quickly detect it for taking in the accumulated 
information he said 
the interview did not say when the devices were found in 1986 
a former national security agency employee ronald w pelton was 
accused of giving the soviets information about us electronic 
eavesdropping one effort mentioned at peltons trial called 
project a was designed to intercept soviet electronic data 
the washington post quoted unidentified intelligence sources at 
the time as saying the project a equipment was placed in the sea of 
okhotsk off the soviet kamchatka peninsula an fbi agent testified 
at peltons trial that pelton told him he had told the soviets 
about project a 
chebrikov kgb chairman since 1982 became a voting member of 
the 13member politburo in 1985 and has made public appearances in 
connection with his post on the ruling body but he has rarely 
talked publicly about the workings of his secretive agency 
the interview apparently was in response to recent calls for 
more information about the roles of top soviet leaders and the 
state and party bodies they head 
it may also have been intended to brighten the kgbs image 
which has suffered in recent press revelations about the show 
trials and purges of the stalin era for many soviets the kgb 
represented part of stalins repression 
the kgb conducts espionage abroad wages counterintelligence at 
home monitors the words and acts of soviet citizens guards the 
countrys borders and protects top state and party figures

sen dan quayle making a bid for the 
farmers vote and attacking democrat michael dukakis as weak on 
defense policies got his best reception of the presidential 
campaign from a group of college students that treated his 
appearance as a pep rally 
about 800 cheering students at the university of central florida 
cheered quayle on friday as he stood near a school mascot with a 
huge papier mache bust of george bush and sounded themes of a 
strong national defense economic prosperity and a promising future 
the students had their football season opener friday night and 
gave quayle the most enthusiastic crowd reception to date since he 
became the republican vice presidential nominee 
gop strategists are hoping the youthful senator will appeal to 
collegeage voters and quayle has said he hopes the younger 
generation will identify with him 
in one of the more exuberant exchanges quayle began to tell the 
crowd that he had served on the senate armed services committee for 
eight years 
eight proud years interjected a voice from the crowd as the 
audience cheered 
an obviously delighted quayle turned to the voice and shouted 
eight proud years 
the only negative notes of the day were sounded by a small group 
of dukakis supporters outside the rally who held signs reading 
quayle is a turkey and women dont vote for men prettier than 
they are 
quayle travels to newnan ga today for an appearance at an 
arts and crafts fair before going to columbia sc for a 
football game tonight between the university of south carolina and 
the university of north carolina 
the indiana senator appeared more confident friday in his 
campaign than at any time in the past two rocky weeks 
at appearances in montgomery ala he attacked dukakis the 
democratic presidential nominee as flat wrong on defense 
issues and made a strong appeal for the farm vote by telling the 
alabama farmers federation and insurance cos that us farmers 
should not have to compete against illegal subsidies of goods 
produced by other countries 
as long as we can get that level playing field the american 
farmer will outproduce and be more competitive than any farmers in 
the world quayle said 
at a montgomery rally quayle said the two tickets disagreed 
most sharply in their approach to national defense issues 
we believe in a strong national defense to deter aggression 
against america and he dukakis does not on matters of national 
defense and foreign policy believe me our opponent is not even 
half right hes just flat wrong quayle said 
quayle said dukakis needed some education about the defense of 
america because of his opposition to the star wars spacebased 
defense system the mx missile and other weapons systems

the federal government for permission to dump massachusetts waste 
106 miles offshore in 1985 a later agreement allowed massachusetts 
to dump farther out to see beyond the continental shelf

tropical storm there were no reports of injuries

mph 
the storm center stalled on reaching the eastern sierra madre 
mountain range 50 miles from the gulf coast said the national

parts of veracruz and tamaulipas states 
we can say the storm is becoming disorganized a weather

a city of 120000 about 165 miles northeast of mexico city it said 
at that time the storm was carrying winds up to 74 mph the minimum 
strength to be classified as a hurricane 
the storm caused power outages in tuxpan and poza rica about 20

a federal prosecutor recommended 
members of a former ruling junta including former president 
leopoldo galtieri be imprisoned from 15 to 20 years for starting 
the 1982 falklands war 
prosecutor luis moreno ocampo told a federal appeals court on 
friday that gen galtieri adm jorge anaya and brig gen basilio 
lami dozo were responsible for the loss to britain of the 74day 
war and for the deaths of 712 argentines killed in the conflict 
in may 1986 the armed forces supreme council convicted all 
three of misconduct for their command of the three military 
branches in the war which began after argentine forces invaded the 
disputed islands 
the military court sentenced galtieri to 12 years in military 
prison anaya to 14 and lami dozo to eight they were allowed to 
keep their ranks pending the outcome of an automatic appeal to 
civilian court 
all three sought to have their convictions overturned but 
moreno ocampo asked for a 20year prison term for galtieri 18 
years for anaya and 15 years for lami dozo 
also on trial are three lowerranking officers who were 
acquitted by the supreme council argentinas highest military 
tribunal 
moreno ocampo requested five years prison for vice adm juan 
jose lombardo four years for gen mario menendez and three years 
for gen omar parada 
menendez was military governor of the falklands during the war 
and surrendered argentine forces to the british on june 14 1982 
at the capital of port stanley 
parada commanded army troops on the islands lombardo was 
commander of navy forces in the south atlantic 
at issue is how the war was conducted a military inquiry found 
that argentine troops were poorly trained equipped and led 
the inquiry focused in part on the decision by anaya a former 
navy head to virtually withdraw the fleet from combat after the 
cruiser general belgrano was sunk by a british submarine and on 
the strategy and tactics of argentine soldiers on the islands 
since the appeal began july 26 moreno tried to show that 
argentinas military rulers did not anticipate britains military 
response nor prepare for it 
defense attorneys argued that argentina almost won the war and 
charges of incompetence were unfounded 
also defense attorneys claimed britain consistently refused to 
negotiate the islands return to argentina and such political 
considerations should be taken into account 
britains claim to the falklands dates to 1833 argentina claims 
it inherited the islands which it calls the malvinas upon 
achieving independence from spain in 1810 
about 1900 people mostly sheep ranchers and fishermen live on 
the windswept islands 
at wars outbreak argentinas economy was deteriorating and 
opposition rising to the junta the war was seen as a lastditch 
attempt by the military in power since a 1976 coup to gain public 
support 
the humiliating loss to britain was followed by the militarys 
decision to turn over the government to an elected civilian leader 
in october 1983 attorney and human rights leader raul alfonsin was 
elected president 
a ruling by the fourman appeals court was not expected for 
several weeks

utility and fire officials coping with downtown 
seattles threeday power outage had a new worry friday what will 
happen when the electricity goes back on jolting equipment from 
bank computers to appliances 
it could be like opening floodgates said hugh mcintosh of 
seattle city light whose crews hoped by sunday to relight a large 
part of the citys retail and financial core which has been 
without power since wednesday 
utility crews rigged lines from street lights outside the 
affected area to provide street lighting friday night for the first 
time since the outage began traffic signals however remained 
dark 
if thousands of computers lights air conditioners and 
appliances are on when power comes back the load on the circuits 
could cause a sudden voltage dip mcintosh said 
it would be like halftime during a ball game when everyone 
flushes all the toilets and the water pressure drops he said 
that could damage computers and other appliances with 
microprocessors including videocassette recorders televisions and 
microwave ovens he said further it could trip sensitive 
monitoring equipment at city lights substation causing another 
blackout 
the voltage drop can really foul up computers mcintosh 
said its not a fire threat but were concerned that it could 
damage our equipment that controls power frequency and could 
possibly cause the power to go back off 
mcintosh earlier said that refrigerator motors could be damaged 
when power was restored but said friday evening he was 
subsequently told that was not the case 
officials are concerned that if the extensively repaired 
underground wiring has a short when power is turned back on it 
could lead to another fire like the one wednesday that knocked out 
power mcintosh said 
officers at great northwest federal savings and loan located 
one block south of where an underground electrical fire knocked out 
power for hundreds of businesses turned off their computer as a 
precaution 
weve turned off everything and intend to leave it that way 
until things are back to normal said dianne backus division 
manager 
like many downtown businesses the savings and loan scaled back 
operations in order to keep open at all ms backus helped staff a 
card table where customers ids were checked before they were let 
into the saving and loan two at a time to make withdrawals for 
the weekend 
this is banking the way it used to be she said were 
taking down every transaction by hand and every couple of hours run 
to one of our branches and enter everything into the computer 
roy davis spokesman for the seattle fire department estimated 
90 percent of the businesses were closed by the worst power outage 
in city history 
regular checks were being made of fire alarm systems and at 
apartment hotels where officials feared guests might be using 
candles or gaspowered camping stoves 
if we find anyone doing that were going to cite them said 
davis frankly this situation is new to us and were a little 
nervous weve got several cars patrolling just to look for fires 
the party atmosphere of the first 24 hours without power faded 
as hotel guests got over the novelty of being issued complimentary 
flashlights and instead complained of 15story climbs to rooms 
i began to notice a little soreness in my calves yesterday 
said janet hardin of eaton ohio a guest at the 40story westin 
hotels south tower which had just one of three elevators in 
service 
westin officials tried to accommodate most guests in the hotels 
north tower where there was air conditioning to offset temperatures 
in the mid90s 
most people havent complained about the heat said dior 
hill public relations manager for the luxury hotel to people 
from atlanta and houston this is nothing unusual 
downtown streets were slightly less crowded than usual sidewalk 
generators drowned out the sounds of city buses and cars directed 
by traffic cops standing in for powerless stoplights 
by friday afternoon city light crews had replaced about a mile 
of cable burned by an unexplained fire in an underground vault 
another mile still had to be replaced before the utility could turn 
the power back on 
utility spokeswoman julia greenlee said superintendents of about 
20 buildings would be asked to be on hand to turn their air 
conditioning and other major equipment back on piecebypiece to 
help control surges 
there have been no injuries reported during the power outage and 
heavy police patrols have been credited with preventing breakins 
police lt al lorette said 35 to 40 officers extra officers were 
assigned to patrol the blackedout area in addition to about 40 
officers who normally work downtown 
you see whats on top of that car seattle police officer 
re lutz asked gesturing to a police car with red and blue lights 
on its roof thats why theres no looting

a consumers advocacy group believes owners of 
cars manufactured by toyota should know about secret warranties the 
japanese company has on its vehicles and has asked the federal 
trade commission to order the automaker to directly notify 
carowners 
the toyota documents clearly show that the company has an 
internal policy that systematically reimburses consumers for 
failure of specific components beyond the written warranty said 
sam cole of the center for auto safety 
certainly every toyota owner should be made aware of 
the policy he said 
the center often critical of the automakers and their 
regulators on friday filed its petition with the ftc a year ago 
the center asked the ftc to require all manufacturers to disclose 
secret warranties

relatives of americans who died in the soviet 
downing of a korean airliner in 1983 marked the fifth anniversary 
of the tragedy with a call for a full congressional investigation 
into unanswered questions still surrounding the incident 
it would be a dangerous precedent to let this matter fade into 
oblivion said nan oldham of bethesda md the mother of a 
27yearold man killed in the air disaster 
it is fitting indeed imperative for congress to conduct a 
fullscale investigation said mrs oldham cochair of a family 
members organization during a friday news conference armed 
with its subpoena power and the right to examine more than 1200 
stillclassified documents congress can uncover the truth 
we feel betrayed by our government whose silence in this case 
rationalized by the questionable claim of national security 
concerns is beginning to resemble a deliberate coverupshe said 
sixtythree americans were among the 269 people who died aboard 
korean airlines flight 007 when it was shot down on sept 1 1983 
after passing over soviet territory while on a flight from 
anchorage the plane had strayed more than 350 miles off course

opposition leader kim daejung said 
today the military will never again seize power in south korea and 
he said he is confident the nation will achieve political stability 
after the olympics 
kim also told the associated press that he doubted radical 
students or communist north korea would attempt to disrupt the 
olympic games in seoul 
the head of the opposition party for peace and democracy said 
the political situation was complicated and uncertain but he 
believed democratic progress would continue after the olympics 
we feel that after the olympic games our political situation 
can be stable he said 
the armed forces will never rule the country again because the 
south korean people became too strong and mature to endure any more 
military governments kim said 
no general can dream of such a thing even if he takes power 
through a military coup it cannot last long he said 
kim played down concerns expressed by many koreans about the 
possibility of a government crackdown after the olympics some 
opposition leaders fear the government is being moderate to avoid 
alienating world opinion during the olympics but that there may be 
a crackdown after the games 
south korea has been ruled for most of its 40year history by 
authoritarian military and civilian leaders 
the opposition leader said president roh taewoo assured him 
wednesday that the military would declare its neutrality in 
politics we have agreed only democracy can solve our problems 
he said 
kim did not say whether the opposition would try to force roh to 
hold a referendum on whether or not he should stay in power roh 
said last year he would call for a refendum of some kind after the 
olympics 
we are not in a hurry to expel him roh from the political 
arena kim said 
roh a former general defeated kim and rival opposition leader 
kim youngsam in december presidential elections roh replaced 
former president chun doohwan who took power with military 
backing in 1980 the elections were called after massive 
antigovernment demonstrations 
kim said roh must investigate and settle issues such as alleged 
corruption in the chun administration 
the opposition leader also said he doubted radical students 
would try to disrupt the sept 17oct 2 games with violent 
demonstrations the students know they will not be supported by 
our people he said 
kim said north korea would not disrupt the olympics because it 
would be condemned worldwide 
north korea has said it will boycott the olympics if it is not 
allowed to be a cohost of the games the norths demand has been 
rejected but south korean officials fear their communist archrival 
may try to disrupt the olympics 
the one serious threat to the olympics would appear to be 
international terrorists some of whom have ties with north korea 
kim said

the nations most powerful unmanned 
rocket failed to lift a secret military satellite into the proper 
orbit effectively rendering it useless according to a source 
close to the space program 
engineers were trying to determine whether they could salvage 
the satellite launched atop a 16story titan 34d friday morning 
the source speaking on condition of anonymity said late friday 
night 
however the source was not hopeful anything could be done to 
place it in the correct orbit 
a civilian expert has said the booster carried a satellite that 
could eavesdrop on soviet military and diplomatic communications 
a successful launch would have been the third in a row for the 
titan 34d which was grounded for 18 months after two explosions 
lt col ron rand director of public affairs at the eastern 
space and missile center here said the air force had a policy of 
not commenting on the results of military space launches 
in washington pentagon spokesman maj william oconnell said he 
knew of no problem with the launch 
the threestage titan 34d roared away from its launch pad here 
at 805 am friday 
the boosters third stage ignited correctly putting the 
satellite in a highly elliptical orbit ranging from 100 miles to 
22300 miles above the earth the source said 
but the rocket failed to reignite which would have put the 
payload in a geosynchronous or stationery orbit 22330 miles over 
the equator said the source 
a military reconnaissance satellite would be useless unless it 
was in a geosynchronous orbit 
the air force following its practice of recent years did not 
announce the launch in advance but issued a statement afterward 
john e pike a space policy expert for the washingtonbased 
federation of american scientists said last month the payload 
would be a satellite designed to monitor soviet missile tests and 
monitor radio telephone radar and other electronic military and 
diplomatic communications 
he said the satellite carried an antenna built to unfold to the 
size of a baseball field 
the launch was the third for the titan 34d which will remain 
the nations most powerful unmanned rocket until an upgraded 
version the titan 4 makes its launch debut later this year also 
with a military satellite both are made by martin marietta corp 
in denver 
a titan 34d carrying a reconnaissance satellite was launched 
successfully last october from vandenberg air force base calif 
another blasted away from cape canaveral a month later and placed 
into orbit a satellite to provide warning of a hostile missile 
attack 
before the october launch the titan 34d had been grounded for 
18 months following two straight explosions of the rocket 
these two launches from canaveral and last octobers launch 
from vandenberg illustrate the success of americas return to a 
more robust spacelaunch capability the air force said in its 
postlaunch statement 
during the long titan 34d grounding the air force was unable to 
lift heavy military satellites into orbit because the only other 
available carrier the manned space shuttle was grounded because 
of the challenger explosion in january 1986 
that led to a critical backlog of military payloads waiting to 
get into space to help break that logjam the air force is backing 
development of titan 4 titan 2 and delta 2 rocket systems they 
will make their first launches either late this year or early next 
year and are expected to see considerable use over several years

authorities evacuated about 100000 
residents from lowlying areas in the outskirts of dhaka today as 
rising flood waters threatened new areas of the capital officials 
and witnesses said 
flood waters reached the streets of affluent residential 
districts where most of the foreign diplomats live witnesses said 
many of the residents remained at home because flooded streets 
prevent them from leaving 
the us embassy building in the center of the city of 4 million 
also was threatened 
a security officer at the us embassy said the complex was dry 
but water was about ankle deep on the street in front of the 
building water also was ankle deep around president hussain 
mohammad ershads residence said his press secretary toab khan 
at least 300000 people have fled their homes in the countryside 
and taken shelter in dhaka after floods that inundated onethird of 
bangladesh floods are common each year in bangladesh and last year 
killed at least 1500 people 
the capital remained cut off for the second day because water 
covered much of the airports runway 
the nationwide death toll from the annual floods that started in 
june reached 842 news reports said the governments toll 
regarded as understated was 300 
independent bengalilanguage newspaper sangbad reported 84 
people had died since friday across bangladesh the paper said most 
of the deaths were caused by collapsing houses 
no deaths have been reported yet in dhaka where flood waters 
range from a few inches in the center of the city to six feet in 
the outskirts half of the city was affected 
many residents at relief camps set up in the city complained 
that they were going hungry 
we have been here for the past three days there has been no 
food nor any medicines from the government said saira banu who 
has taken shelter in a relief camp along with her four children 
on friday the buriganga river a tributary of the ganges river 
was about three inches above the flood stage its highest level in 
34 years 
the flood forcasting and warning center predicted today that the 
river would rise another 52 inches 
residents were evaquated from lowlying areas near an embankment 
that separates dhaka from the buriganga 
tens of thousands of people have taken shelter in schools 
government buildings and in 125 governmentrun relief camps in the 
city the influx triggered fears of food shortages in the capital

boosted by rebates that could cut the sticker 
price by almost 25 percent us sales of the suzuki samurai set a 
record in august despite concerns about the fourwheeldrive 
vehicles safety 
official sales figures will not be reported until tuesday but 
douglas mazza general manager of suzukis automotive division 
said friday he hoped the total would exceed 10000 for the month 
the surprising turnaround appears to be the result of the 
generous dealer incentive program by the japanese carmaker and 
fading public concern about the rollover issue raised by consumers 
union publisher of consumer reports magazine 
it will clearly be a record for our company which is 
impressive for 80 to 90 days from when our accuser first came at 
us mazza said 
sales plummeted 706 percent in june to 2199 after the june 2 
report by consumers union the group said the suzuki samurais 
center of gravity was too high making it too likely to tip over 
when the driver swerved sharply 
american suzuki produced its own tests and statistical evidence 
to back its claim the samurai was safe and on july 13 announced 
2000 incentives to dealers that made it possible for them to cut 
a quarter of the samurais 7995 base price 
samurai sales rose to 6327 in july about average 
sales from aug 1 through friday which is the end of the latest 
reporting period will smash the record of 8365 set in july 1987 
said laura segall of the public relations firm rogers amp 
associates suzukis public relations agency 
the dealer incentive program ended friday and the company and 
its competitors will be watching closely to see whether the sales 
momentum continues 
suzuki had been counting on a rebound in samurai sales to create 
a good atmosphere for the introduction this fall of two new 
vehicles a bigger more powerful more expensive sportutility 
vehicle named the sidekick and a passenger car named the swift 
the sidekick is scheduled to be introduced this month the swift 
will be introduced in october in a twodoor hatchback version and 
in november in a fourdoor hatchback model 
the samurai received a boost thursday when the national highway 
traffic safety administration turned down petitions to investigate 
and recall the vehicle the agency said the samurai is no more 
dangerous than similar vehicles made by other companies 
the agency did grant a consumers union request to start a 
rulemaking procedure to establish a minimum standard for vehicles 
to protect against rollovers 
the transportation department agency said it had found 113 
reported rollovers involving the samurai and related vehicles made 
by suzuki which resulted in 25 deaths and 120 injuries but the 
agency attributed many of the rollovers to unsafe driving drinking 
and unfamiliarity with the vehicles 
american suzuki based in brea calif is the us arm of 
japans suzuki motor co

four defiant yonkers city councilmen held fast 
to their refusal to bargain with a federal judge sending their 
troubled city toward bankruptcy for continuing to resist a 
courtordered desegregation plan 
one day after he was given a green light by the us supreme 
court us district judge leonard sand on friday reimposed fines 
on the city just north of new york that can soon amount to 1 
million a day and bankrupt it in short order 
the judge then unsuccessfully tried to work out a settlement in 
informal talks with the recalcitrant councilmen but the discussion 
ended within an hour with the two sides apparently no closer to 
agreement 
in 1985 sand found the city guilty of racially segregating 
housing for four decades the city council has refused to approve 
plans to build low and moderateincome housing to aid 
desegregation 
the nations highest court thursday night affirmed the crippling 
levy sand imposed in his effort to bring the city into line with 
the law 
however the court stayed the 500aday personal fines and jail 
terms sand had imposed on the four councilmen 
sand said that despite the stay the councilmen still have a 
responsibility to the citizens they represent who will bear the 
brunt of these city fines 
sand ordered the city to pay the fines accumulated over the 
labor day weekend 192000 on tuesday as previously promised 
by sand more than 85000 of the money will be earmarked for 
yonkers public schools and to guarantee the payment of interest on 
city bonds the balance will go to the us treasury and is 
nonrefundable 
sand then called on lawyers for all parties in the 
longsimmering legal battle to meet with him privately to explore 
informally some ideas we have for a possible solution of this 
crisis 
lawyers for both sides and city officials emerged tightlipped 
from the brief meeting in the new york courtroom 
it was not successful said mayor nicholas wasicsko who 
favors complying with sands housing desegregation order 
michael sussman attorney for the national association for the 
advancement of colored people said there was no progress and 
called it a hostile discussion 
i havent changed my position i will do what i have to do 
said henry spallone one of the defiant councilmen 
sand told city attorney michael sculnick he could renew his 
request that the judge stay the city fine if between now and 
tuesday when the 192000 is due and payable i am satisfied that 
we have reached a point which makes it appropriate that the fines 
be suspended or payments delayed 
the citys fine started at 100 on aug 2 and doubled daily for 
a week until it was stayed pending appeals the city has paid 
12700 so far the fine reaches its 1millionaday cap next 
friday 
gov mario cuomo said he would direct the states emergency 
financial control board on tuesday to begin making the substantial 
reductions in city spending that will be required by sands order 
the board took control of the citys finances aug 9 
even with the cap on the fine yonkers the states 
fourthlargest city with a population of 200000 would be bankrupt 
by midnovember city officials said 
cuomo who had been reluctant to get involved said last week he 
would initiate removal proceedings against the four councilmen if 
the fines were reimposed against the new york suburb 
the control board passed a resolution the same day saying it 
would seek criminal charges against the four if the fines were 
reinstated the allegations would be that the four jeopardized the 
citys fiscal condition violating the law that established the 
control board 
however cuomo spokesman gary fryer said friday that for the 
time being the governor would not attempt to oust the councilmen 
the supreme courts order late thursday stayed a lower court 
ruling that had upheld contempt citations against the four 
councilmen who had been paying their 500aday fines and would 
have been subject to imprisonment this weekend 
on aug 1 the council voted 43 against a desegregation plan 
that would provide incentives to build 800 units of moderateincome 
housing throughout the city sand found the councilmen in contempt 
the next day and since then three additional efforts to pass the 
housing plan have failed

ninetyfive people survived when the boeing 727 en route to 
salt lake city plunged to the ground and burst into flame seconds 
after takeoff wednesday at dallasfort worth international airport 
at the service for the vogels many of the mourners who filled 
congregation shearith israel synagogue said they knew the couple 
personally 
i look at you and i know you feel as i do we feel ill 
physically spiritually mentally emotionally said rabbi jordan 
ofseyer who called the couple two of our finest most useful 
friends 
vogel 69 and his wife 67 were traveling to canada for a 
vacation they were remembered as tireless leaders of the jewish 
community and the city who worked quietly and without publicity 
even if she wasnt well she called to see how you were 
doing said geraldine sobel who knew the couple since 1962 
in march 1987 the dallas jewish coalition for the homeless 
opened a daycare center where homeless families searching for work 
could leave their children mrs vogel was the driving force that 
organized the coalition a group of 26 jewish organizations while 
her husband a certified public accountant helped with the groups 
books 
its going to be hard without thelma but we cant let her 
down because it was her dream said doris budner who with mrs 
vogel was cocoordinator of the coalition i suppose well never 
know but i think the reason they are not here today is because 
they were trying to help other people out of the plane that 
would be like her 
besides helping with the homeless coalition vogel was a member 
of a number of civic professional and religious organizations he 
was president of the jewish federation of public accountants and 
presidentelect of the texas association of accountants 
the couple had two grown sons 
all of us are poorer for the tragic deaths we memorialized 
this day said rabbi gerald klein but oh how rich we are 
because they lived among us

government officials have overestimated the amount 
of meat available to the public for years by padding per capita 
production statistics with animal fat and meat byproducts pravda 
reported 
in a lengthy article the communist party daily reported serious 
shortcomings in the countrys meat production 
thursdays article told soviets what most already knew that the 
soviet union doesnt produce enough meat to feed its people 
properly the story was part of a wider campaign launched since a 
communist party meeting earlier this summer focusing attention on 
food and consumer goods shortages and calling for a crash program 
to improve supply and distribution 
pravda cited government statistics as claiming that each soviet 
consumed 141 pounds of meat last year near the annual level of 154 
pounds health officials recommend 
it turns out the meat consumption figure for 1987 includes 16 
million tons of animal fat and subproducts of a second category 
not containing meat pravda said the subproducts include 
heads legs ears and tripe people were eating 13 pounds a year of 
this kind of meat pravda said 
the actual per capita consumption figure was closer to 128 
pounds pravda said but even that was unevenly distributed around 
the country 
the method of calculating the figure was drafted during the 
years of stagnation the catchwords for the rule of soviet 
leader leonid i brezhnev the statistics were inflated to 
convince ourselves how well were were living the newspaper 
said 
under brezhnev and even before government officials overstated 
output of factories and farms they supervised to qualify for 
bonuses and give the impression often false that they were 
meeting governmentset plan targets 
the article was part of the campaign for glasnost or 
greater openness on some issues encouraged by soviet leader

the 51 contestants in this years 
miss america pageant checked out the competition as they spent 
their first full day together 
the competitors from the 50 states and the district of columbia 
were individually ushered around as they signed in friday posed 
for photographers and chatted with reporters 
each day leading up to the sept 10 televised finale in the 62nd 
pageant the competition that starts wednesday grows just a little 
one of the first unofficial contests is the fashion parade upon 
arrival 
the outfits worn by the women as they arrived thursday in this 
seaside gambling resort were eyecatching even if only the 
hostesses and media were watching 
leather suits stylish hats patent leather high heels and belts 
that emphasized tiny waists appeared to be the trend 
but friday was the big chance to make an early impression on the 
other contestants so even practice leotards were adorned with 
jewelry and fingernails were perfectly manicured 
of course most contestants dont openly admit they are sizing 
up each others chances at winning the crown and scholarship money 
its really neat when you get a bunch of overachievers 
together were all anxious to meet each other not necessarily to 
size up the competition said miss iowa tiffany ann dibernardo 
we have a common bond said miss nebraska jodi sue miller 
there were 78000 girls in preliminary competitions narrowed down 
to 51 so its neat to compare goals and there are lots to 
compare 
miss north carolina lee beaman said she was surprised at how 
friendly the whole group was when the contestants met for the 
first time i was expecting a little more of conspicuously 
checking out the competition 
miss vermont julie tidd conceded that the competitive spirit 
perhaps will come as time goes on this week 
the contestants already have had several opportunities to leave 
marks of individuality each contestant wrote a greeting on a 
wooden cutout of their state which then was attached to a giant 
wall map 
some focused on their talents such as miss oklahoma lori lee 
kelley a singer who wrote oklahoma is operatunity 
others focused on timely issues such as miss iowa who wrote 
no drought about it success still grows 
in the middle of it all three pigeons flew into the cavernous 
convention center and decided to visit 
in horror the miss america hostesses tried to shoo the birds 
away fearful that they would leave their calling cards on the 
new pink carpet 
if you do anything on this carpeting ill said hostess 
betty frisch chasing after a bird with a wagging finger

the position of wing flaps and slats on 
the wreckage of delta flight 1141 conflicts with a crew members 
recollection and cockpit recordings indicating the crucial devices 
were properly set for takeoff investigators say 
national transportation safety board teams also have been 
wrestling with a lack of physical evidence that would indicate the 
boeing 727 was having engine problems as the cockpit recording and 
witness accounts have suggested 
flight engineer steven judd the first crew member interviewed 
since wednesdays crash told investigators friday that everything 
aboard the jet seemed normal before takeoff 
thirteen people died when the jet crashed at the end of a 
dallasfort worth international airport runway and burst into 
flames after what investigators said was an usually long takeoff 
approach 
judd said the jets right wing dropped severely as the plane 
left the ground and that capt larry davis tried to take corrective 
action there were no abnormal engine sounds judd said although 
he recalled hearing the words engine failure 
that statement was picked up on cockpit voice recordings as was 
the preflight checklist of the wing flaps ntsb member lee 
dickinson said at a briefing friday night 
15 15 green light dickinson quoted a voice on the tape as 
saying that would seem to indicate both wing flaps were in the 
proper 15degree downward angle for takeoff he said 
dickinson said judd had the same recollection of the flaps 
position which help provide the lift a plane needs to become 
airborne 
investigators however said the flaps in the wreckage appeared 
to be in the up position and the planes slats which are on the 
forward edge of the wings were found to be partially extended 
the opposite of the correct takeoff position 
ntsb officials said locking devices on the slats likely would 
have prevented them from being knocked out of position during the 
crash 
investigators have also said the handle controlling the flaps 
inside the cockpit was in the wrong position but cautioned that it 
could have been jarred out of place during the crash or the 
evacuation of the crew 
federal investigators determined that the flaps and slats of a 
northwest airlines md80 were not properly set for takeoff when 
that plane crashed aug 16 1987 at detroit metropolitan airport 
killing 156 people 
evidence also has not yet confirmed witness accounts that the 
delta jets engines flared during takeoff a phenomenon that could 
indicate compressor stall within the engines said bernard 
loeb the ntsbs deputy director of investigations 
the plane left the gate at its scheduled departure time of 831 
am but did not take off for almost 30 minutes 
judd said he remembers that there were normal engine 
indications and that other aspects of the takeoff were normal up 
to and including the time the nose wheel left the ground dickinson 
said 
no signs of damage have been found on any of the planes three 
engines which dickinson said will be dismantled at the hartford 
conn plant of their manufacturer pratt amp whitney 
the engines were removed friday and ntsb investigators were able 
to get a better view dickinson said they reiterated that there 
was no visible evidence of any engine failure or any engine 
problem he said 
ninetyfive of the 108 people on board survived most by 
scrambling out of emergency doors over the left wing and through a 
crack between the cabin and cockpit 
nine victims found piled up at a rear door may have had trouble 
opening the emergency exit loeb said he said the problem may have 
been the angle of the fuselage and the weight of the door rather 
than the design of the door 
after the crash it took more than one person to open the door 
loeb said 
investigators hope the survival of the flights cockpit crew 
will make it easier to reconstruct the accident 
they said they would wait until the pilot capt larry davis 
and the first officer carey wilson kirkland jr were more fully 
recovered before talking to them 
davis 48 was in fair condition friday at a dallas hospital and 
kirkland 37 was in stable condition at a suburban hospital 
services were held for three of the victims friday three more 
services were scheduled for today all 13 victims were from texas

a quiet retiring giant panda more inclined 
to munch foilage than make a play for the spotlight has become the 
top draw at the cincinnati zoo 
more than 60000 people have tickets to see chia chia the giant 
male panda who goes on display today at the zoo during his 
threemonth stay in a 5000mile journey to a breeding program in 
mexico 
chia chia will be the most popular display ever at the zoo 
which will use profits from the exhibition for conservation of the 
endangered pandas the zoo said 
its the most charismatic and popular of all the animals 
said zoo director ed maruska 
the panda was flown from the london zoo to chicago then taken 
by van friday to his temporary home in cincinnati 
the toledo zoo ran into opposition when it put two giant pandas 
from china on display this summer drawing charges it was 
exploiting the animals the world wildlife fund and the american 
association of zoological parks and aquariums tried to prevent the 
animals from being shipped out of shanghai but failed to get a 
court order 
cincinnatis zoo avoided such controversy because its only a 
stoppingoff point for an animal involved in a breeding program 
and because of its agreement to use money from the exhibit for 
panda breeding and conservation programs

border killing a man and injuring at least 23 people officials

highway 23 miles south of eagle and 110 miles east of fairbanks on 
friday after encountering a fuel truck while descending a hill 
state troopers spokesman bill farber said here 
twentythree passengers were hospitalized in fairbanks 
including one person in intensive care and the others were sent to

the driver david kasser 24 of anchorage suffered superficial 
injuries and shock said gray line spokesman dave bean 
further information on the extent of the injuries and the

helicopters provided by the military state troopers and a company

voters today chose a new generation of leaders 
for this prosperous asian citystate but the prime minister since 
1959 was not expected to retire from power 
voting was compulsory for those 21 or older and a heavy turnout 
was expected before the polls closed at 8 pm 8 am edt about 
145 million people were eligible to cast ballots in the districts 
contested election day was declared a national holiday 
the governing peoples action party was expected to win the 
parliamentary election by a big margin prime minister lee kuan 
yew who will be 65 on sept 16 was expected to step down in favor 
of first deputy prime minister goh chok tong 46 
lee who called the election truly a watershed has been 
prime minister since 1959 and more than half of the 26 million 
people have known no other leader 
lee is to retain the powerful post as the governing partys 
secretarygeneral and although he has expressed disinterest is 
still regarded as the most obvious candidate to be the countrys 
first elected president 
the proposed elected presidency remained the key issue as the 
nineday campaign wound down friday it would replace the current 
appointed ceremonial post with a president holding veto power over 
spending the nations ample financial reserves and nominations to 
senior civil service and judicial positions 
at stake in the election were 70 of the 81 seats in the recently 
enlarged parliament the other 11 seats were captured unopposed by 
the governing party when nominations closed aug 24 
nominees from seven opposition parties and four independent 
candidates mounted a challenge the last parliament had 79 seats 
76 held by the governing party one by the opposition and two 
vacant when it was dissolved 
there are 42 traditional singlemember voting districts but in 
a new wrinkle all parties entered in 13 constituencies had to 
nominate a panel of three candidates at least one of whom had to 
be from an ethnic minority group voters select a team of three 
each of whom gets a separate vote in parliament 
the population is 76 percent chinese about 15 percent malay and 
6 percent indians 
elections were called 16 months before a new election was 
required 
diplomatic analysts said the government hoped to take advantage 
of a booming economy and full employment with the early elections

the first day of floridas first legal 
alligator hunt in 26 years netted about 130 gators across the 
state state game officials report 
thirtyeight of the huge reptiles were bagged in the everglades 
and 36 were taken near lake okeechobee the florida game and fresh 
water fish commission which is supervising the hunt said friday 
while some lucky hunters bagged animals as long as 9 feet most 
of the 230 people granted hunting permits were disappointed after 
the first day of the monthlong gator season 
the hunters selected at random from among about 5000 permit 
applicants set out at sunset thursday with harpoons nooses 
crossbows almost anything but a gun which was forbidden 
david and jerry navin two novice hunters snaked through a dade 
county canal in the darkness looking for the redreflecting eyes 
that give the reptiles away at night but the gators refused to 
play along 
theres a few here but theyre not really doing what theyre 
supposed to chuckled david navin theyre a little tougher 
than we thought 
farther north on lake okeechobee another of the designated 
hunting areas some gator pursuers fared better 
thomas alpern 25 of new york city the only northerner to get 
a permit bagged a ninefooter despite worries he might not manage 
to kill the animal even if he captured it 
the meat and hide of a single alligator can fetch 300 to 500 
the alligator population in florida has about doubled to an 
estimated 1 million since federal antipoaching methods were 
adopted in 1970 nearly 1000 gators have been captured in 
experimental hunts since 1981

the prison terms handed a polygamist band 
for a church bombing and police standoff that left a lawman dead 
were blasted as overly lenient by utahs top federal prosecutor 
but chief us district judge bruce jenkins citing mandatory 
sentencing guidelines said friday he had no choice but to set 
prison terms of 15 years for clan ringleader addam swapp and five 
years for swapps motherinlaw vickie singer 
swapps brother jonathan swapp and mrs singers son john 
timothy singer both 21 each received mandatory 10year sentences 
for a pair of firearms charges and five years probation on two 
other counts 
ive heard stronger sentencing comments from a judge in a 
drunk driving case said a livid us attorney brent ward who 
said he probably would appeal the sentences 
frankly i was surprised said addam swapps attorney john 
bucher 
it was interesting but it doesnt matter swapp said friday 
night ive got little children who will be married in 15 years 
it might as well have been the death penalty to me 
prosecutors said swapp 27 could have been imprisoned for 75 
years and mrs singer for 50 for their roles in the jan 16 bombing 
of a mormon chapel in marion and a 13day siege of their farm by 
100 federal and state officers 
i think once again that everyone involved in this whole 
process continues to wonder why it ever occurred jenkins told 
mrs singer 45 who tearfully begged him to free her 
jenkins said federal mandatory sentencing laws imposed by 
congress illustrate a crisis of the whole sentencing process 
as the defendants appeared before jenkins in separate hearings 
the judge repeatedly stressed that their sentences were not the 
decision of the court but the will of congress which knows 
nothing about this case 
the criticism of congress infuriated ward who rose to defend 
the statutes at the end of the day then called a news conference 
he said the sentences would be appealed on ground that jenkins 
declined to impose penalties on some counts and handed out what 
prosecutors believe were lessthanminimum terms on others 
theres no case i know of that more clearly shows the wisdom 
of congress in imposing minimum sentences ward said 
if an appeal is filed it could take as long as a year to 
resolve the issue he said 
such an action would not affect plans to file state murder 
charges in the shooting death of state corrections lt fred house 
who was killed in the shootout that ended the siege jan 28 said 
ward 
the family contended the bombing was ordered by god as a sign of 
the impending collapse of the mormon church and all government and 
that it would trigger the return of patriarch john singer who was 
slain by police nine years before for resisting arrest 
a jury convicted the four clan members in may of 20 of 23 counts 
jenkins sentenced swapp to consecutive mandatory fiveyear 
sentences for two firearms counts and for maliciously damaging the 
church with a bomb he stayed pending successful completion of a 
fiveyear probation sentencing for attempted murder of federal 
agents forcibly resisting and assaulting agents and bomb 
possession 
he declined to sentence swapp on a useofabomb count saying 
it duplicated the malicious damage count 
mrs singers mandatory fiveyear term was for use of a firearm 
jenkins declined to sentence her for bomb use he stayed a 
fouryear sentence for malicious damage and a pair of twoyear 
sentences for forcible assaultresistance and bomb possession 
violation of her fiveyear probation would force imposition of the 
stayed sentences a government attorney said 
in addition to their mandatory 10year terms on the firearms 
counts jonathan swapp and john timothy singer both received stayed 
sentences for attempted murder and assaulting and resisting agents 
pending successful completion of five years probation

hundreds of miners carrying a 
solidarity banner today ended a sitin at a southern coal mine and 
workers in a northern port halted their strike ending polands 
worst labor unrest in seven years 
about 250 dirty and unshaven workers left the july manifesto 
coal mine where they had been holed up since aug 16 they carried 
their belongings in plastic bags and sang the national anthem as 
they walked through a heavy drizzle to a nearby church 
solidarity activist jan litynski said the miners agreed to halt 
the strike early today after a night of talks with solidarity 
leader lech walesa 
the end came on the eighth anniversary of the end of another 
strike by jastrzebie coal miners during the upheaval that gave rise 
to solidarity 
earlier more than 2000 port and transit workers in szczecin 
left the work sites they had occupied since aug 17 artur balasz 
a member of the strike committee there said they ended the sitin 
despite worker allegations that the government had backed down on 
promises of job security for strikers 
the miners walked two miles to a jastrzebie church where a 
priest celebrated mass for them their families and supporters from 
other mines other miners waiting at the church chanted thank 
you thank you as the july manifesto miners arrived 
a string of police vehicles pulled out of the city road blocks 
were dismantled and no strike banners remained at the mine 
the nationwide strikes for legalization of solidarity higher 
pay and better working conditons began at july manifesto 
at its peak the unrest involved 20 enterprises employing 
100000 workers including the lenin shipyard in gdansk where 
solidarity was born and where walesa works as an electrician 
on wednesday walesa appealed for an end to the strikes so that 
promised talks with the government could begin on the strikers 
demands the july manifesto workers demanded that walesa explain 
his appeal in person 
the opposition and authorities were preparing lists of proposed 
participants for the talks said roman catholic mediator jacek 
ambroziak in warsaw 
walesa who rose before dawn friday and drove seven hours from 
his baltic coast home in gdansk to the mine pressed through the 
afternoon until early today with miners to end the strike 
a new round of negotiations with management was launched with 
walesas participation and lasted into early today said officials 
at the mine 
everybody was very nervous throughout walesa helped us out 
a lot he helped map the way out of our situation said grzegorz 
sawski a member of the strike committee 
the haggling concerned winning guarantees of job and personal 
security for strikers said a polish journalist at the mine who 
asked not to be identified 
the 1800 dock workers and 600 bus depot workers in szczecin 
offered to end their strike as soon as job security was guaranteed 
for strikers 
this is an expression of support for lech walesa we just 
wanted to follow his suggestions said balasz explaining why the 
szczecin workers were willing to end their strike 
the szczecin port and bus depot and the july manifesto mine were 
the only facilities still on strike as of friday 
shipyard and port workers in gdansk and steel workers in the 
southeastern city of stalowa wola ended strikes thursday after the 
appeal from walesa 
at a meeting wednesday with interior minister czeslaw kiszczak 
and alternate politburo member stanislaw ciosek walensas first 
with senior authorities since 1982 they agreed to discuss 
solidaritys future and other issues shortly after the strikes 
ended walesa said 
miners at the july manifesto mine started to strike 19 days ago 
after they received their paychecks they demanded higher wages to 
compensate for 60 percent inflation and incessant price inreases 
and they also demanded better working conditions 
but like other strikers around the country the no 1 demand was 
the restoration of solidaritys legal status 
communist authorities first guaranteed the right to free trade 
unions in an agreement signed aug 31 1980 giving rise to 
solidarity but the soviet blocs first independent trade union was 
suppressed in the december 1981 martial law crackdown 
although formally outlawed in october 1982 it has survived 
first mainly as an underground organization and more openly in 
recent years

a vaccine that blocks strep throat and 
rheumatic fever has been successful with laboratory animals and may 
be ready for human tests in six months a medical researcher says 
the vaccine is made through genetic engineering by attaching 
genes from streptococcal bacteria to a form of salmonella bacteria 
rendered harmless in the laboratory 
edwin beachey a microbiology professor at the university of 
tennesseememphis says mice given the vaccine withstood doses of 
strep that were thousands of times greater than needed to trigger 
an infection 
he said friday he is applying to the federal government and the 
required review boards at the university to test the vaccine on 
human beings 
its a new approach to vaccination with an engineered organism 
and so it has to pass some standards that many review boards are 
not quite used to said beachey who also is director of research 
at the veterans administration medical center in memphis 
results of work on the vaccine were published last month in the 
journal of experimental medicine 
the research was conducted by beachey and thomas poirier of the 
memphis medical school and michael kehoe of the university of 
newcastle in london 
they attached a strep gene to a weakened form of salmonella 
bacteria that causes typhoid fever 
the salmonella which has been used for years in a typhoid fever 
vaccine was induced by the strep gene to produce a substance 
called m protein beachey said 
given to laboratory mice the salmonella died quickly in the 
animals intestines while the m protein led to the production of 
antibodies for rheumatic fever 
the weakened salmonella genetically altered in 1985 by other 
researchers has been given to thousands of people to prevent 
typhoid fever but this is the first time it has been used to 
transmit genetic material from another form of bacteria beachey 
said 
were simply using it as a delivery vehicle where we can clone 
another gene into it he said you sort of have a double barrel 
here where youre not only vaccinating against typhoid but in the 
same dose youre also vaccinating against strep sore throat and 
rheumatic fever 
rheumatic fever which can cause fatal heart damage is a major 
health problem in third world countries and incidents of the 
disease appear to be on the increase in the united states beachey 
said 
it had declined over the last 20 years but in the last three 
or four years it has been rising up again here in memphis we used 
to see maybe one or two cases a year and last year we saw 35 he 
said

the most senior shiite moslem cleric in 
lebanon today blamed the united states for parliaments failure to 
elect a new president and said such a policy would backfire 
if the americans want to continue with their dangerous game 
then a force stronger than what they have known will explode in 
their face said the cleric sheik mohammed mehdi shamseddin 
what happened on aug 18 was an americanisraeli plot said 
shamseddin referring to the date on which parliament failed to 
muster the needed quorum of 51 members to elect a new president 
the only serious candidate was syrianbacked warlord suleiman 
franjieh 78 according to lebanons constitution a new head of 
state should be elected before sept 23 when the sixyear term of 
president amin gemayel expires 
parliament speaker hussein husseini a shiite adjourned the 
abortive election session without setting a date for a new meeting 
to elect a president 
syrianbacked leftist and moslem factions have accused the 
united states and the rightwing christian lebanese forces militia 
which is sympathatic to israel of blocking franjiehs election 
franjiehs backers have also accused the lebanese forces of 
forcefully preventing deputies from attending the parliamentary 
session to block the election of franjieh a personal friend of 
syrian president hafez assad 
the christian militia has denied the charge and said the 
boycotters opposed franjiehs election 
a lebanese forces spokesman who demanded anonymity said there 
will be no quorum as long as franjieh remains a candidate 
this in light of the present balance power dimmed the 
prospects of electing a new president 
a us state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley has 
attributed parliaments failure to elect a new president for 
wartorn lebanon to the lack of a consensus candidate 
shamseddin addresing a news conference at his residence in 
moslem west beirut said the united states wants to end syrias 
regional middle eastern role to give israel a free hand in 
lebanon 
we are determined not to succumb to the american stand said 
shamseddin who heads the supreme shiite islamic council in lebanon 
syria the main power broker in lebanon maintains 40000 troops 
in eastern and northern provinces as well as west and south beirut

about 600 radical students denouncing 
the war olympics battled riot police today and hurled 
firebombs but troopers did not use tear gas because of a new 
government ban 
communist north korea meanwhile announced today it would 
boycott the sept 17oct 2 olympics because its demand to be a 
cohost had been rejected 
the students demanding the olympics be shared with north korea 
pelted troopers with scores of firebombs and rocks in a clash at 
sungkyunkwan university police hurled rocks and unexploded 
firebombs back at the protesters who also brandished iron bars and 
wooden clubs 
several protesters and officers were injured but police had no 
figures 
a declaration by the students said if the olympics cannot 
help nurture a desirable atmosphere they are nothing but divisive 
olympics dictatorial olympics and war olympics 
radical leaders claimed during a rally before the clash that the 
olympics were being used by the government to impose dictatorial 
rule and increase the risk of war with the north 
north korea in a report carried by its official korean central 
news agency said the olympics were being used to perpetuate the 
division of the korean peninsula and it urged other nations to back 
its boycott 
for us olympic games are important but more important is the 
future destiny of our entire nation for this reason we cannot 
take part in the olympic games that is forced by singlehanded 
hosting said the report monitored in tokyo 
the agency citing a statement released by the norths olympic 
committee said the games will be crippled by a boycott but 
only cuba and ethiopia have said they will back north korea 
the head of the seoul olympic organizing committee park 
sehjik said earlier today that seoul would keep the door open 
until the last day of the olympics for north korea to participate 
the international olympic committee and south korea said the 
games could not be shared because they are given to a single city 
talks last month failed to produce an agreement between the two 
koreas on the olympics 
park also said police would not use tear gas to disperse any 
protests during the olympics to avoid disruption the gas used by 
riot police during demonstrations often floats into residential and 
business areas and the government does not want to spoil the games 
there will be no tear gas even if one or two groups stage any 
disruptive actions park said 
radicals have said they may stage protests during the olympics 
the radicals a small but powerful minority on campuses lack 
public support 
opposition leader kim daejung said today he doubted that the 
radicals would attempt to disrupt the olympics the students know 
they will not be supported by our people kim told the associated 
press in an interview 
kim also played down any potential threat from north korea 
south korean officials fear the north may attempt to sabotage 
the olympics the two sides see the olympics as a major symbol in 
their struggle for dominance on the divided korean peninsula 
the peninsula was divided in 1945 the north invaded the south 
in 1950 to start the korean war and the border between the two 
sides remains tense

democratic presidential candidate 
michael dukakis chided republican rival george bush today for 
referring to the increase in the unemployment rate as 
irrelevant 
yesterday unemployment went up dukakis told an 
earlymorning rally another 200000 people without jobs 
the vice president said it was irrelevant those are people 
those are our fellow citizens its not irrelevant 
during campaign appearances friday dukakis took aim at dan 
quayle the republican vice presidential nominee 
dan quayle doesnt know very much dukakis said when told 
the indiana senator had called him a bigspending liberal 
in a brief exchange with reporters at the sioux falls airport 
dukakis said people like quayle call themselves conservative 
they havent voted for a balanced budget in their life 
in an interview with regional reporters at the airport in 
spokane wash earlier in the day the democratic presidential 
nominee responded sharply when asked if quayle is qualified to be 
vice president in an administration headed by republican george 
bush 
i dont know of anyone who thinks dan quayle is qualified to 
be president he said 
look at his record in the congress his lack of experience 
said dukakis i dont think he was selected because he was 
qualified to be president 
dukakis was winding up a prelabor day campaign swing with a 
stop at ellis island the first stop in america for his greek 
immigrant parents more than 75 years ago 
dukakis father landed there in 1912 at the age of 16 his 
mother was 9 when she arrive in america less than a year later 
his mother euterpe and new york gov mario cuomo were among 
those joining dukakis for the trip to the island in the new york 
harbor where generations of immigrants landed 
dukakis emphasis on his immigrant heritage is a major factor in 
his bid for the support of blue collar voters many of whom are 
also first or secondgeneration americans 
although voters who retain strong identification with their 
ethnic roots have traditionally been heavily democratic in their 
preference they shifted allegiance to republican ronald reagan in 
1980 and 1984 
the campaign swing included appearances in california oregon 
and washington and a brief sleepandrefueling stop friday night in 
sioux falls 
during stops in portland ore and spokane wash on friday 
dukakis ridiculed the idea of naming quayle to head the war on 
drugs in a bush administration 
is there anybody here today is there any citizen in the 
united states of america who thinks dan quayle is qualified to be 
the nations drug czar he asked drawing cheers and hoots from 
partisan crowds 
he repeatedly contrasted what he described as quayles 
inexperience with the long career of texas sen lloyd bentsen the 
democratic vice presidential nominee 
isnt it nice to have a democratic nominee for vice president 
whose qualifications have never been questioned by anybody he 
said at a rally at a steelworkers union hall in spokane 
were going to have a vice president whos been a leader in 
the us senate he told a rally in portland ore 
during a brief tour of a kaiser aluminum co plant in spokane 
dukakis wrote in big block letters on a roll of aluminum made in 
usa workers cheered

a political foe of prime minister rajiv 
gandhi was arrested today in connection with the slaying of indias 
top badminton player after newspapers alleged he had an affair with 
the sportsmans wife 
sanjay singh 32 was arrested in lucknow the capital of uttar 
pradesh state 250 miles southeast of new delhi said an official 
of the central bureau of investigation the official cannot be 
identified under briefing rules 
the bureau patterned on the united states fbi took over 
investigations into the july 28 slaying of syed modi the national 
badminton champion after a request from the uttar pradesh 
government 
modi 28 was gunned down by an assailant using a colt 
38caliber revolver as he stepped out of a lucknow sports stadium 
where he had gone for his customary evening round of practice 
newspapers quoting unidentified sources in the central bureau 
of investigation said last month that investigators had found 
evidence of an affair between modis widow ameeta and singh the 
evidence followed days of searching for a motive to the slaying 
the sources said 
on aug 16 an associate of singh and three other people were 
arrested on murder charges in modis death 
ameeta modi was arrested on charges of conspiring to murder her 
husband five days later but she was released on bail by a 
magistrate within three days when she said there was no one to care 
for her 6monthold daughter 
in india people charged with murder usually are not granted 
bail 
the allegations in the newspapers drew angry reactions from 
singh a former gandhi ally this is the worst kind of political 
vendetta he said in new delhi last week the prime minister 
and his coterie are using government agencies to intimidate the 
opposition their plan is to discredit me in order to give rajiv 
gandhi a victory in the next general elections 
singh is not a political star outside uttar pradesh but he is 
the scion of the former royal family of amethi gandhis 
parliamentary constituency royal titles were abolished in 1971 but 
members of ruling families still command considerable influence 
over their former subjects 
singh was the campaign manager and chief architect of gandhis 
mammoth victory from amethi during the last national elections for 
parliament in 1985 the prime minister drew more than 90 percent of 
the votes cast 
but the two fell out last year singh resigned from the 
governing congress party and vowed gandhi will not win the next 
election in amethi 
singhs arrest follows several rounds of questioning by 
detectives and a search of his lucknow residence the search drew 
criticism from several opposition politicians because it was shown 
on stateowned national television 
they want to try sanjay singh through electronic media said 
arif mohammed khan who like singh resigned from the congress 
party year they want to finish him

as 18yearold dan wolotsky unpacked his 
clothes on orientation day at wheaton college he said he had 
hardly thought about being in the first class of men admitted to 
new englands oldest womens college 
until he received a letter from an upperclasswoman 
she wrote me saying i hope you bring a stuffed animal 
because everyone has one recalled wolotsky of hightstown nj 
thats when it dawned on me what i was doing my uncle told me to 
bring a bullfrog he said thatll scare them 
wheaton is welcoming male students this fall for the first time 
in its 154 years a decision reached after a bitter stuggle with 
alumnae who opposed the change seventyfive men will be in this 
years freshman class of 402 
school officials said the decision to admit men to wheaton is 
part of the trend to make singlesex colleges coeducational because 
newer generations of students demand it 
the interest in going to a womens college has diminished 
said gail weaver director of admissions and student aid 
ninetyfive percent of our women come from coeducational settings 
where theyve had the opportunity to be editor of the school paper 
or class president and theyve never felt discriminated against 
they feel theres no reason to buy into the argument that they need 
to go to school with just women to succeed 
weaver said fewer than 100 womens colleges remain in the 
country almost half are small churchrelated schools she said 
the transformation of wheaton which is 35 miles south of 
boston to a coeducational school was rocky 
some alumnae balked when they learned of the january 1987 
decision to admit men they claimed that many alumnae donated to 
the school in recent years without knowing of the plans eventually 
to admit men 
the matter went to court where a probate judge ruled in june 
that wheaton must notify all donors that it will return their 
donations if requested 
its a very sad day said mary anne marsh 31 a 1979 
graduate and one of the alumnae who protested its diminishing 
what little opportunities are left to women who want to attend 
small liberal arts schools 
administrators said little has been changed to accommodate men 
on the idyllic 378acre campus of brick buildings and a white 
chapel 
they were however forced to buy longer beds 
and packages of toiletries distributed to incoming freshmen on 
orientation day now include a separate package for men which 
several women noted does not contain the laundry detergent given 
women and has better razor blades 
the people most excited about men coming to wheaton were not 
surprisingly incoming women 
i wouldnt be here if it wasnt coed said susan howland 
18 of lincoln ri as she unpacked in her dormitory room 
thursday i think its going be fun maybe a little odd because 
there arent that many men 
i came basically because it was going coed said nadja 
drazien 18 of montreal i think our society means that women 
have to learn how to work alongside men 
school officials also had reason to be enthusiastic 
administrators said enrollment has increased 30 percent since they 
decided to admit men the college will house 1150 students this 
year tuition is 16700 a year 
like other men wolotsky is a little concerned that only one 
sport will be available to men this fall cross country officials 
are building a new athletic facility that eventually will mean a 
bigger sports program for men 
mark sweet 19 standing in line to register said he wanted to 
come to wheaton because his two aunts and grandmother are alumnae 
he said he has endured some teasing from friends about being sought 
after by women on campus 
my first response is to tell them to shut up said sweet 
im paying a lot to study and get a good education my social 
life is important but thats not what im paying 17000 a year 
for

michael dukakis and a resurgent george bush 
are locked in an exquisitely close race for the white house as they 
head into the fall campaign according to an associated press 
survey of the 50 states 
its going to be down and dirty to the very end said 
republican state rep tom ryder of illinois a key battleground 
state where republicans concede that dukakis maintains a slight 
edge 
in delaware as in the rest of the country theres been a 
substantial shift in the last three weeks from dukakis to bush 
said the states gop gov michael n castle i think it started 
at the republican national convention as to be expected but 
since the convention its continued even with the problems 
surrounding the dan quayle candidacy 
the latesummer surge by bush eroded dukakis earlier advantages 
in key electoral college battlegrounds from california to new 
jersey with illinois ohio and michigan in between say leaders in 
both political parties the result is a series of tight bigstates 
races whose outcome will likely decide ronald reagans successor in 
the white house 
dukakis selection of texas sen lloyd bentsen as his vice 
presidential running mate transformed bushs adopted home state and 
its 29 electoral votes into an instant tossup but bush has 
countered elsewhere the vice president seemingly has moved ahead 
in florida with 21 electoral votes as well as making up ground in 
the industrial midwest one poll in massachusetts even rated 
dukakis home state a tossup though the ap survey still found the 
state to be solid ground for the democratic nominee 
in small states and large the politicians who keep close tabs 
on the presidential race report a close contest that is unlikely to 
be decided until the final few days campaign debates and 
unexpected international events could have a dramatic influence on 
the race 
id say right now its a flip of the coin said former iowa 
democratic chairman ed campbell reflecting the sentiment of party 
professionals around the country it could go either way 
senior officials of the two campaigns pronounce themselves 
pleased with the shape of the race 
said susan estrich dukakis campaign manager nationally 
were competitive states will go up and down its exactly where 
we thought it would be this is a very evenly matched contest 
we all felt like wed be lucky if we were in the single 
digits meaning seven eight or nine points behind by labor day 
said lee atwater bushs campaign manager 
officials in both camps agree that the race is subject to sharp 
swings especially since neither candidate is an incumbent that 
heightens the importance of debates currently the subject of 
negotiations between the two campaigns it also leaves the race 
open to sudden shifts due to a mistake by either of the candidates 
or their running mates democratic sen bentsen and republican sen 
dan quayle or to an unforseen international event 
rich bond a senior aide in the bush camp says the race shapes 
up this way basically youve got a tight race with the south 
looking pretty much george bushs way the west with the exception 
of the coast california oregon and washington is heading our way 
but cant be taken for granted 
bond estimated that bush heads into the race armed with a solid 
150 to 200 electoral votes principally from southern and rocky 
mountain states and that dukakis probably can count on a base of 
150 electoral votes largely from the northeast 
it takes 270 electoral votes to win the white house and 
republicans have won four of the last five elections with solid 
southern and western support jimmy carter a southerner is the 
only democrat to break the republican string of victories in the 
last 20 years 
democrats believe they can win electoral votes from each region 
of the country and note that bentsens addition to the ticket makes 
texas and its 29 electoral votes an extremely competitive race 
dukakis adviser tom kiley puts each candidates reliable base 
closer to 100 electoral college votes 
even so recent opinion polls indicate a dwindling advantage for 
dukakis is states he has long counted in his column including 
maryland and west virginia as well as massachusetts 
charlie baker who is in charge of dukakis field organization 
said the democratic goal is to keep the race competitive in 45 or 
46 states so that if the republicans have a bad week they can 
lose in any of them and i think we can keep it that close 
he said 
with 10 weeks until election day these are the straws in the 
wind 
california the biggest state with 47 electoral votes is 
viewed by both sides as a key tossup state with a slight initial 
edge to dukakis the state was a tie in one recent poll dukakis 
led in one recent poll in oregon and washington was a tie in 
another survey 
republicans express confidence they can virtually sweep the 
rocky mountain region democrats hope to steal a state or two 
perhaps colorado or new mexico or montana 
the deep south looks strong for the republicans dukakis 
selection of bentsen already has forced bush to devote several days 
to campaigning at home in texas but republicans express confidence 
they ultimately will win dukakis hopes to peel away a border state 
or two and maybe even challenge in north carolina 
the northeast is dukakis home region and his strongest from 
new york to massachusetts to maryland both sides give the democrat 
the early edge in pennsylvania new jersey and connecticut have 
recent republican histories but are key targets for both 
candidates 
the midwest is wide open for both sides although quayles 
spot on the republian ticket ended any talk of a democratic 
surprise in indiana aside from illinois michigan and ohio 
dukakis is viewed as the strong leader in minnesota and ahead less 
convincingly in wisconsin and iowa bush led by 9 percentage points 
in a recent missouri poll but republicans rushed to say they 
doubted either candidate could carry the state by that much 
republicans expect to carry nebraska and kansas 
democrats say they have spent the past several weeks 
methodically building a field organization preparing television 
commercials and mapping out their fall campaign and that the race 
wont be decided until the final days of the campaign 
but where the democrats sounded optimistic 10 weeks ago now it 
is the republicans who have been heartened by their candidates 
latesummer offensive 
republicans concede dukakis probably has the lead in illinois 
and a narrow advantage in michigan and ohio for the moment 
california was a dead heat in one recent poll 
thats great news as far as im concerned said the states 
gop chairman bob naylor three weeks ago it was looking peretty 
grim

ralph berthene looked forward to socializing 
this weekend with 100 people from around the country who see things 
the way he does from about 6 feet 5 inches up 
it was a great experience to not have to stoop when youre 
talking to somebody the 32yearold st paul man said of the 
first time he went to a twin cities tall club event 
the minneapolisst paul chapter is holding its annual weekend 
gettogether for members of the 50yearold tall clubs 
international including a costume party pig roast dinner and 
sightseeing tours 
no basketball games were planned says chris hager president of 
the twin cities chapter who just meets the womens height 
requirement at 510 men must be at least 62 to join 
members dont concentrate on activities celebrating their 
tallness but they do joke about it and print the jokes on 
tshirts they sell said hager 45 a heating company controller in 
nearby spring park 
one says i may be the first to get rained on but ill be the 
last to drown theres another one that says no i dont play 
basketball do you play miniature golf the one i really like is 
reach down and touch someone said hager 
berthene added quickly we really dont have anything against 
short people 
one chapter even has an annual baseball game with members of a 
short peoples club hager said 
the tallest member in the clubs history was the late don 
koehler an 8foot2 member from the chicago area said the clubs 
mere 5foot7 historian doris chickering the highland md woman 
is an honorary member married to a guy who is 62 
the 92member twin cities chapter was founded 47 years ago and 
serves minnesota iowa and north and south dakota 
having fun with other tall people was the main reason the 
organizations founder 6foot2 kae sumner einfeldt 72 of santa 
cruz calif started the tip toppers club of los angeles 
the retired freelance commercial design artist who worked on 
snow white and the seven dwarfs held the first meeting in 
1938 she said she was inspired to start the worlds highest 
society by her work on walt disneys film 
i like to tell people i got so sick and tired of looking at 
dwarfs she said they used to call me the giant girl who 
painted dwarfs for disney 
tall clubs international claims 5000 members and prospective 
members in 50 clubs in this country and canada the 60 european 
clubs have about 7500 members 
the clubs remain social organizations but have begun working to 
make life easier for a population that is growing taller says the 
past president of the international chapter 6foot7 carl bouler 
52 of phoenix ariz 
clothing and retail executives were invited to the clubs 
national convention last year to hear members desires for better 
selection among tall fashions bouler said 
the clubs once urged an automaker to install telescoping 
steering and the company came out later with tilt steering wheels 
i think we gave them the idea although they never admitted it 
einfeldt said 
otherwise gaining acceptance for attributes besides their 
height has been a major accomplishment 
it is very common when any number of us walk into a restaurant 
or any other place that people turn and look at us because we are 
tall tall people seem to be considered to have a lot of authority 
by other people hager said 
i dont think its bad but i dont think a lot of us realize 
we are treated as we are we dont understand the authority we 
are being given

europes largest aviation event the farnborough 
air show opens sunday in southern england with daredevil 
aerobatics scheduled to go ahead despite the air show disaster in 
west germany 
if anything the interest is greater said air commodore dan 
honley spokesman for the organizers of the weeklong show at 
farnborough 35 miles southwest of london 
of course we are proud of the fact that our air displays are 
the safest in the world weve been refining the rules for almost 
40 years honley said in an interview 
the british red arrows the royal air forces display team of 
seven scarlet hawk fighters regularly thrill crowds at air shows 
in britain and abroad they are to perform daily wednesday through 
next sunday to a show that organizers say will attract about 
350000 visitors 
but at farnborough among the worlds biggest showcases of new 
civil and military aircraft air displays are a sideline to the 
serious business of selling 
this year 700 aerospace manufacturers from 24 countries 
including the united states and the soviet union are showing their 
wares the organizers say sales could top 167 billion worth of 
orders made during the last farnborough show 
for the first time soviet fighters are on display in the west 
two mig29s the soviet unions newest and most advanced 
warplanes flew into farnborough last week with a welcoming escort 
of royal air force tornado fighters they will go through their 
paces daily flying low over the hampshire countryside 
also at farnborough will be the latest versions of the us f16 
and f18 fighterbombers and making its air show debut the us 
marine corps harrier 2 
on the civil side mcdonnell douglas is unveiling its md80 
engine whose representatives claim can save up to 40 percent in 
fuel consumption 
the aerospace industry is booming and the air transport 
industry is booming said honley deputy director of the 
sponsoring society of british aerospace companies 
he predicted record orders for farnborough which alternates 
with le bourget in paris as host of the annual show 
farnborough opens under the shadow of last sundays disaster at 
the ramstein us air force base when three aircraft of the italian 
tricolored arrows display team collided during a complex air 
manuever 
one of the aircraft crashed into the crowd and exploded 
fiftyone people were killed at least 170 are hospitalized and 15 
remain unaccounted for 
after the ramstein disaster west germany suspended all air 
displays amid growing calls for a permanent ban throughout the nato 
western alliance 
honley said the red arrows operate under stringent safety rules 
and are not permitted to perform directly over spectators or fly 
toward them the most hairraising manuevers when planes zoom 
toward each other from opposite directions and then peel off are 
restricted to two aircraft 
theyd never be allowed to do the sort of manuever that the 
italians did honley said wed never have five aircraft flying 
one way four the other and yet a third at a right angle to both 
and that aircraft flying toward the crowds in our opinion that is 
diabolical 
farnborough where pilots have to fly their displays in front of 
a committee of experts before the show starts has not had an 
accident involving spectators since 1952 when a de haviland jet 
broke up in the air and killed 29 people on the ground 
but with air shows in europe claiming a rising toll including 
an airbus crash in june that killed three people at habsheim 
france demands have grown for a ban on such events 
honley said there are still sensible ways of flying displays 
the red arrows will put on a sensible display

throughout the west bank 
and gaza strip palestinians are holding an intense and sometimes 
violent debate on the wisdom of declaring a state and forming a 
provisional government 
leading members of yasser arafats fatah faction of the 
palestine liberation organization have proposed recognizing israel 
and seeking international recognition for statehood on the west 
bank and gaza strip 
these ideas are meeting surprisingly strong opposition from 
islamic groups and radical leftists 
the misgivings prompted a recent decision to postpone until the 
first week of october a meeting of the 447seat palestine national 
council the plos parliamentinexile 
the debate also has touched off some interpalestinian violence 
last month for example the car of a prominent islamic 
fundamentalist was firebombed in gaza and plo supporters were 
blamed 
daoud kuttab a prominent journalist and leading advocate of the 
provisional government idea wrote in the weekly al sinara that 
palestinians should not hesitate or they would lose a golden 
opportunity 
one of the problems in the past has been that the plo was too 
tied to the principle of national consensus you cant have total 
agreement on every issue the majority should decide having some 
opposition in fact would be healthy kuttab said in an 
interview 
kuttab argued a major benefit of changing from a guerrilla 
organization to a provisional government would be an improvement of 
the palestinian image especially in western eyes 
instead of guerrilla fatigues arafat will be wearing a suit 
and tie its a good idea to change the image of palestinians as 
revolutionaries which is looked at negatively in the west he 
said 
kuttab said a provisional government also would have more 
flexibility in negotiations and be able to change positions when 
necessary in contrast with the plo which had to cling to 
revolutionary ideals 
moslem fundamentalists of the islamic jihad holy war and the 
even harder line hamas zeal are opposed to the existence of a 
jewish state they demand an islamic state and remain outside the 
plo because it calls for a secular nation 
i dont think its the right time to establish a provisional 
government or declare an independent state because the palestinian 
side is weak and the weak are always commanded by the strong 
said ahmed ismail yassin spiritual leader of the islamic jihad 
yassin who is paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair is a 
charismatic figure who preaches in the mujamaa islami mosque on a 
dirt street in the rundown sabra section of gaza city he was 
released in a prisoner exchange in 1985 after being sentenced to 13 
years in jail for financing islamic militants 
in an interview yassin said if the plo doesnt change some 
of its ideas there is no need for us to cooperate with them 
yassin who has hinted that fundamentalists may form an 
alternative plo if a secular state is declared indicated he was 
concerned about interpalestinian violence and warned it was a 
dangerous disease 
the islamic militants broke off cooperation last spring with the 
clandestine united national leadership of the uprising which is 
believed to be made up of representatives from the plo factions 
both groups issue separate underground leaflets calling for 
competing strikes and boycotts they also proclaim their positions 
in multicolored graffiti that covers walls and shops throughout 
the occupied lands 
the slogans of the islamic militants usually have a religious 
theme our martyrs are in heaven yours are in hell 
criticism of fatahs campaign also comes from the left 
they fatah are forcing the issue on which there is no 
unanimity said haidar abdel shaafi a prominent figure 
associated with the communists 
abdel shafi head of the palestinian red crescent society the 
moslem equivalent of the red cross said he opposed for tactical 
reasons making the concession of recognizing israel in advance of 
negotiations 
the matter of recognizing the jewish presence here is really 
no longer in question but how can i recognize israel when israel 
does not recongize me when israel claims all of palestinian to be 
their territory abdel shafi said 
he said he hoped the palestinian council would not take a 
decison until after israels nov 1 elections so as to not to make 
advance concessions 
it is not known which group commands the most support although 
the conventional wisdom is that islamic militants have the backing 
of most of gazas 650000 residents and fatah controls most of the 
west banks 850000 palestinians 
israels foreign ministry has set up a special unit to monitor 
the statements of prominent palestinians on the issue according to 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
we are closely monitoring it but it has com to the point 
where we are taking seriously only decisions not declarations 
said one foreign ministry official 
they always surprise us with their inability to decide but 
they are making a big mistake this time he said they are 
going to disappoint people in the occupied territories

soviet scholars are shedding new light on the 
1962 cuban missile crisis including the disclosure that moscow had 
twice as many troops in cuba as the kennedy administration 
believed says an american author 
startling new information will require a revision of 
historical and analytic accounts of the events of the cuban missile 
crisis raymond l garthoff writes in the autumn edition of the 
journal foreign policy 
garthoff a senior fellow at the brookings institution and a 
state department participant in the crisis based his article on 
soviet sources who under the policy of greater openness or 
glasnost are beginning to publicly discuss formerly taboo 
subjects 
perhaps the most eyeopening revelation in garthoffs article is 
the presence in cuba of 42000 soviet troops in the fall of 1962 
while the united states had very good intelligence on the 
missiles in cuba in october and november 1962 its information on 
the number of soviet military personnel was weak garthoff wrote 
official us intelligence estimates rose from 4500 on 
october 3 to some 800010000 by october 22 to 1200016000 by 
november 19 and finally to 22000 in a retroactive estimate in 
early 1963 he said 
but it turns out this figure was still far too low years 
later fidel castro said the number was 40000 sergo mikoyan a 
soviet scholar has now confirmed that the full soviet military 
complement in cuba in october 1962 totaled 42000 men wrote 
garthoff 
among the other disclosures 
nikita s khrushchev then the kremlin leader decided to 
secretly place nucleartipped ss4 and ss5 missiles in cuba 
without a formal decision by the ruling politburo such 
voluntaristic actions led to khrushchevs downfall two years 
later 
khrushchev considered running a naval blockade ordered by 
president kennedy but was dissuaded by anastas mikoyan then 
deputy soviet premier 
khrushchev did not authorize a proposal by the kgb station 
chief in washington aleksandr fomin to us journalist john scali 
that was long thought to have been the key to ending the crisis 
the deal which was very close to the final resolution called for 
withdrawal of soviet missiles from cuba in return for removal of 
us missiles from turkey 
soviet leaders hurriedly cut a diplomatic deal to get their 
missiles out of cuba because they thought a us invasion of the 
caribbean island was imminent 
the commander of soviet forces in cuba at the time was a 
fourstar general issa pliyev an odd choice because pliyev was a 
career cavalry officer unfamiliar with missiles and with only one 
previous foreign assignment in the far east before and during 
world war ii 
the decision to shoot down a us u2 spy plane over cuba 
during the crisis was made by a soviet onestar general on the 
scene igor statsenko and surprised khrushchev helping spur him 
to lower tension 
most of the new disclosures come from two intellectuals 
associated with the reforms of soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
fyodor burlatski who was a member of khrushchevs inner circle 
and sergo mikoyan who is the son of anastas mikoyan and is an 
expert of sovietcuban relations mikoyan drew on his fathers 
unpublished memoirs 
garthoff also quoted a number of unidentified soviet officials 
who he said are wellplaced but not ready to step into the 
spotlight 
more disclosures are possbile at an international conference on 
the cuban missile crisis tentatively scheduled for january 1989 in 
moscow 
despite the disclosures little is known about soviet 
decisionmaking in the crisis prompting garthoff to conclude that 
crisis management even when handled well is a poor alternative 
to crisis prevention glasnost in policy as in politics and 
history can help avert new superpower crises 
and garthoff said the kremlin is placing more importance on 
accurate historical analysis a rarity before gorbachev came to 
power in march 1985 
for nearly two decades before 1985 the name nikita khrushchev 
was absent from the brief occasional and carefully 
circumscribed soviet accounts of the crisis garthoff wrote 
some writers even managed to address the topic without mentioning 
the presence in and removal from cuba of soviet missiles 
he said more recent soviet articles have been more balanced but 
added new light on moscows key decisions in the crisis has 
scarcely begun to appear in the soviet media although it probably 
will within the year

industrial plant forced the evacuation today of an estimated 20000 
people east of los angeles and seven people were taken to

wispy smokygray fumes poured from the grow group inc plant 
which makes chlorine tablets for swimming pools said kim marti 
plant manager 
it was not immediately known if the leak had been stopped by 
morning 
marti said a chemical reaction produced the chlorine which can 
be lethal in high concentrations but otherwise causes burning eyes 
and sore throats 
until we get in there and identify what caused the reaction i 
cant tell you i dont know marti said 
the manager said the the plant was closed at the time of the 
incident which was reported to county officials at 1219 am

cuba has become one of the most heavily 
militarized countries in the world with more than 250000 
personnel under arms and another 15 million in militia units 
according to us government and independent sources 
by lavishing attention and resources on the military and with a 
substantial assist from the soviet union cuba can send large 
numbers of troops on foreign expeditions without sacrificing its 
ability to defend its own territory 
there are an estimated 60000 cubans serving in angola a figure 
which exceeds by more than 20000 the size of the army of the 
military dictatorship that preceded president fidel castros rise 
to power almost 30 years ago 
state department figures indicate that in latin america only 
brazil with a population 13 times cubas has a comparable 
military establishment 
a recent article in the monthly magazine atlantic said that cuba 
has 250 combat aircraft mostly sovietmade migs compared with 
only 45 for canada a country with 2 times the population and a 
vastly larger land area 
cuba also has about 950 battle tanks some in angola compared 
with canadas 114 the article said all of the equipment is 
delivered for free by the soviet union 
cuba spent an estimated 10 per cent of its government budget on 
the military in 1985 higher than all but a few countries worldwide 
the cuban troop presence in angola has been a sore point for the 
reagan administration which has been trying through diplomatic 
talks to encourage a withdrawal 
the talks have produced agreement on a statement of principles 
by the parties but critics point out there are 40000 more cuban 
troops in angola than when us diplomats undertook their 
initiative more than seven years ago 
in the evolution of the cuban military cuban affairs expert 
rafael fermoselle wrote that cuba has remained in a high state of 
combat readiness since the early 1960s but starting in 1980 
castro has placed the whole country on a wartime footing without 
parallel 
in that year castro began organizing the socalled territorial 
troop militias known by its spanish initials mtt in response to 
his stated concern that ronald reagan a presidential nominee at 
the time posed a threat to the revolution 
by incorporating most ablebodied citizens including women 
into a national defense structure castro felt that no invading 
force could conquer cuba the united states could defeat the cuban 
army but not an entire people according to the theory 
in his atlantic article author john hoyt williams estimated 
that there were 15 million armed and trained men and women in the 
mtts by 1986 arrayed in about 1000 regiments 
japan in the summer of 1945 was not nearly so well prepared to 
resist invasion williams wrote 
an added defense mechanism is the committees for the defense of 
the revolution with a 1986 membership of 66 million the 
committees set up on a blockbyblock basis watch for subversion 
and counterrevolutionary activity 
most troubling to the reagan administration has been cubas 
willingness to deploy military forces abroad angola has been 
cubas most ambitious venture but cubans have been stationed in 
ghana algeria guineabissau ethiopia south yemen syria and 
elsewhere 
in the western hemisphere there are at least several hundred 
cuban military advisers in nicaragua cuba also had a military 
presence in grenada until the 1983 us invasion toppled the 
leftist government there 
a state department report says that cuba has developed an 
extraordinary capacity to influence events in distant lands 
its ability to project power far out of proportion to its size 
is directly related to its association with the soviet union and 
soviet support for the development of its military machine the 
report says

the justice department has officially ended 
its inquiry into the assassinations of john f kennedy and martin 
luther king jr finding no persuasive evidence to support 
conspiracy theories according to department documents 
a justice department memo obtained by a california 
ophthalmologist through the freedom of information act was the 
departments admittedly longoverdue response to the house select 
committee on assassinations recommendation 10 years ago for 
further investigation 
william f weld who was head of the departments criminal 
division until he quit at the end of march told rep peter rodino 
dnj chairman of the house judiciary committee that all known 
leads have been checked 
the department of justice has concluded that no persuasive 
evidence can be identified to support the theory of a conspiracy in 
either the assassination of president kennedy or the assassination 
of dr king weld wrote in the undated memo 
no further investigation appears to be warranted in either 
matter unless new information which is sufficient to support 
additional investigative activity becomes available he added 
the justice departments response to the conspiracy theories 
comes as no surprise it is however the first time the department 
has made a formal conclusion on the assassinations said justice 
spokesman dean st dennis 
the house assassinations committee concluded in 1978 that 
kennedy was probably assassinated as the result of a conspiracy 
involving a second gunman a finding that broke from the warren 
commissions belief that lee harvey oswald acted alone in dallas on 
nov 22 1963 the house panel also said there was a likelihood 
that kings slaying in 1968 was part of a conspiracy 
the committee urged the justice department to investigate 
several areas of the assassinations and one year later the 
department agreed to conduct a limited inquiry focusing on an 
acoustical study presented to the committee by independent experts 
the acoustical experts had concluded after studying a dictaphone 
recording of a dallas policemans open radio transmissions that 
there was a second gunman on the infamous grassy knoll who fired a 
fourth shot that evidence was the key to the committees 
secondgunman conclusion 
justice officials instructed the national academy of sciences to 
review that study and the dictaphone recording and academy 
scientists concluded in 1982 that the independent experts were 
wrong 
weld said the justice department had completed virtually all 
of its inquiry by the end of 1983 but delayed its response to the 
house judiciary committee pending a complete review of all public 
comment on the national academy study 
we have considered the review of all correspondence to be 
potentially productive he said but he said there was no 
persuasive criticism of the academy report so the justice 
department has accepted its conclusions 
others including rep louis stokes dohio chairman of the 
defunct assassinations committee have stood by the committees 
conclusions and the acoustical evidence presented by the 
independent team 
stokes could not be reached for comment friday but a former 
select committee aide who has fought to have the panels records 
opened to the public blasted the departments response 
all these years later we find out theyve been doing 
nothing said kevin walsh members themselves had faith that 
the justice department was going to pursue this and now we see all 
these years later that their faith was misplaced 
walsh noted that the department did not follow through on 
several parts of the select committees recommendations 
the most egregious sin according to walsh was the 
departments failure to obtain and analyze a bystanders film shot 
just minutes before the kennedy assassination the film by charles 
l bronson scans the sixthfloor window of the texas school book 
depository where oswald was positioned 
if you have film footage that bears on a murder case you 
subpoena it walsh said they didnt even consider it 
weld wrote that the department was unable to obtain the film 
from the owner 
the justice department conceded that the report to rodinos 
committee was long overdue 
one of the interesting features of employment with a large 
governmental organization is that matters occasionally come 
bubbling to the surface from the depths of the bureaucracy 
acting assistant attorney general thomas m boyd wrote in a letter 
to rodino accompanying the weld memo an example of this 
phenomenon is the enclosed report which relates back to the 
activities of the select committee on assassinations 
boyds letter to rodino was dated march 28 and accompanied the 
memo from weld 
the documents were sent to dr louis p kartsonis a san diego 
ophthalmologist on a freedom of information act request he made 
through sen alan cranston dcalif and rep bill lowery rcalif 
kartsonis said he has conducted research and delivered lectures 
on the kennedy assassination for more than 15 years he too 
criticized the justice departments inquiry saying investigators 
failed to answer the select committees questions

congress returns this week to a full agenda of 
budget and spending bills contra aid welfare reform and antidrug 
legislation but eyeing an early adjournment so lawmakers can 
campaign for reelection 
the house and senate aim to complete work by sept 30 all 435 
house seats and 33 of the 100 senate seats will be up for grabs on 
election day nov 8 
despite the wide assortment of issues congress has to deal with 
the agenda will be chiefly driven by attempts to enact a pentagon 
budget bill and 11 separate spending measures by the oct 1 
beginning of the new fiscal year 
only two of the 13 appropriations bills needed to finance the 
government have been passed and signed into law 
defense will certainly be the big thing that we have to agree 
on im pretty optimistic that everything else can be worked out 
sen pete domenici rnm ranking republican on the senate budget 
committee said last week 
sen david pryor dark agreed 
i think the defense budget will be a large part of the agenda 
all the other issues will fall into place because people want to 
get out for the election he said 
reagan last month vetoed the first pentagon budget bill sent him 
by the democraticcontrolled congress because he objected to arms 
control restrictions and cuts in his proposed star wars budget 
the senate has passed a second defense budget which includes 
the same proposed star wars slashes but none of the arms control 
limitations 
when lawmakers return a housesenate conference committee will 
try to write a compromise bill that reagan might sign one of the 
conferees will be sen dan quayle of indiana the republican vice 
presidential nominee 
the senate version of the defense bill also includes a 
democraticbacked contra aid proposal which the house is likely to 
approve with few changes the current contra aid plan expires sept 
30 but the new plan calls for 27 million in nonlethal aid 
food clothing and shelter and sets up procedures for a 
subsequent vote on releasing 165 million in frozen military 
supplies 
if reagan requests the military aid house speaker jim wright 
dtexas has vowed not to stand in the way of a vote 
the senate is trying to avoid a large catchall spending bill 
last years measure known as a continuing resolution merged all 
13 appropriation bills and was 1057 pages long in his state of 
the union address in january reagan threatened to veto a 
similarsize bill this year 
i think we can avoid a big one this year said domenici 
we may end up with a small one but it wont be anything like 
what happened last december 
the spending fights will be played out against the backdrop of a 
presidential race in which two senators are the major party vice 
presidential candidates sen lloyd bentsen of texas is the 
democratic nominee 
if the republicans try to dream up some vote to try to 
embarrass sen bentsen they have to be aware that whatever they do 
could also catch sen quayle pryor said 
while quayle will be among the conferees on the defense bill 
bentsen is one of the housesenate negotiators nearing agreement on 
a plan changing the way the government helps the nations poor 
the administration expressed reservations last month about the 
way the compromise was shaping up but congressional democrats may 
decide to send reagan the bill and force him to decide whether to 
veto it 
the reform effort centers on a greatly expanded work education 
and training program for welfare recipients the biggest stumbling 
block is a provision requiring some recipients to do community work 
both chambers are also trying to come up with legislation 
designed to halt the flow of illegal drugs the house will begin 
work on its version wednesday with the senate to follow later 
a proposal by house democrats which they hope will win gop 
votes would add up to 2 billion a year to the 39 billion the 
federal government spends anually fighting drugs 
the legislation contains more money for education treatment 
rehabilitation and state and local law enforcement 
the house has also tentatively scheduled a sept 14 vote on a 
bill guaranteeing 10 weeks of unpaid jobprotected leave for new 
parents employed by firms of 50 persons or more the business 
community opposes the bill contending it would make companies 
uncompetitive and the government shouldnt mandate employee 
benefits 
another campaign issue child care is the subject of numerous 
bills in both chambers the fastestmoving bill is the 
democraticbacked 25 billion act for better child care services 
reagan and other conservatives oppose the measure but democrats 
have declined to compromise and a showdown could loom

the nations past presidents may need more 
advertising judging from a survey that found youngsters able to 
name more brands of alcoholic beverages than former chief 
executives 
the children ages 8 to 12 were each able to name an average of 
52 alcoholic beverages but just 48 presidents reported the 
center for science in the public interest 
the center a nonprofit health advocacy group said it surveyed 
180 boys and girls in washington dc and suburban maryland 
this survey indicates the extent to which booze is part of the 
daily life of children who cannot drink legally for another 10 
years commented michael jacobson head of the center 
among the findings of the survey 
a 10yearold girl rattled off 14 alcoholic beverages but could 
name only four presidents 
an 11yearold boy who could name eight brands of beer and 
wine said there are 16 inches in a foot 
another 11yearold boy correctly spelled matilda bay king 
cobra and bud light but rendered the presidents names as 
nickson and rosselvet 
and a 7yearold boy who could name 10 brands of beer and wine 
listed as presidents aprilham linchon and ragon

the uss stark returned to a 
lowkey welcome at its home port saturday after 10 months in a 
shipyard to repair 90 million damage caused by two iraqi missiles 
in the persian gulf 
about 100 people were on hand as the guidedmissile frigate 
docked at bravo pier where a memorial to the 37 sailors killed in 
the may 1987 attack has been placed 
it is the same pier from which the stark left in february 1987 
for what was to have been routine duty in the persian gulf 
its good to be a family again instead of a longdistance 
family said jennifer hayward who with her three children waited 
for her husband 
she recalled how the crippled ship was greeted by hundreds of 
people bearing balloons and welcomehome banners when it returned 
after the attack last year last august it was a a lot more 
emotional she said 
lt cmdr tim taylor a navy spokesman said that no ceremony 
was scheduled for the return of the stark from ingalls shipbuilding 
in pascagoula miss where it underwent repairs 
we want the stark to be just like every other ship said 
mayports commanding officer capt john mitchell 
another ship the uss boone also came home saturday after a 
oneyear overhaul in new orleans its no different one from the 
other mitchell said 
the stark left mississippi on wednesday with 16 officers and 174 
enlisted men who spent the year in mississippi helping with the 
repairs or doing other navy work 
before heading home the ship passed trials of its guns its 
ability to track air and surface targets its engines and its 
steering the repairs were completed on time and cost about 52 
million less than estimated officials said 
the searing heat from the exocet missiles destroyed the starks 
berthing area and combat information center as well as radar 
equipment rooms and other compartments 
the stark underwent temporary repairs in bahrain after the 
attack before the long voyage home a year ago 
the government of iraq which claimed responsibility for the 
attack will be sent a bill for the repair costs it also has 
promised to compensate the families of the 37 sailors killed in 
what it said was an accidental attack

in bringing john sasso back to his campaign 
michael dukakis locked in an increasingly tough fight for the 
presidency with george bush turned to his trusted corner man the 
alterego with whom he has fought and won many a battle before 
the most telling remark about their relationship came from 
dukakis himself last year at their worst moment when the governor 
and thenlongshot presidential candidate described his departing 
campaign manager as like a brother 
last weeks announcement of his return as campaign vice chairman 
immediately energized a campaign headquarters full of staffers 
reading reports their effort was moribund 
now weve got the ateam said dukakis campaign issues 
adviser thomas herman a former dukakis state aide brought into 
that job by sasso theres no question that john is as close to 
michael dukakis as anyone else is 
dukakis and sasso met on a train platform in 1978 shortly after 
dukakis suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of edward j 
king in the democratic gubernatorial primary sasso so impressed 
that dukakis kept a commitment to attend an event he had organized 
offered his assistance should dukakis decide to venture back into 
politics 
mindful of that promise dukakis in 1980 asked sasso to manage 
his 1982 comeback effort against king a bruising campaign that 
included an incident not unlike the attack video episode that 
drove delware sen joseph biden from the presidential race and 
sasso from the dukakis presidential campaign 
sasso played for reporters what became known as the sex tape 
a parody that made fun of the kings wifes struggle against 
polio that same campaign included a dukakis television ad in which 
a supporter was shown cheering on dukakis and referring to king as 
a son of a bitch 
dukakis won the nasty primary battle and coasted to victory in 
the fall back in office he installed sasso as his chief secretary 
his top liason with legislators who wanted little to do with 
dukakis in his first term 
hes the hit man said former house minority leader royall 
switzler john is the guy behind the scenes for dukakis and has 
proven himself to be the master of dirty tricks said switzler 
adding that it was sasso who would negotiate legislative deals for 
dukakis by threatening votoes of pet projects to win votes for 
controversial matters backed by the governor 
dukakis loyalists disputed switzlers characterizations 
he believes in playing the game with vigor but with fairness 
as well said john devillars sassos former deputy who remains 
at his statehouse post 
sasso 41 also assumed a role he came to relish handling the 
governors media relations dukakis never goes off the record with 
a reporter sasso would do so frequently steering reporters to 
what he considered stories 
it was in that role that he distributed to reporters videotapes 
showing biden borrowing without attribution the rhetoric of a 
british politician a story that began a flurry of negative reports 
that forced biden from the race 
that sasso described by one dukakis aide as the man with the 
best instincts in the business targeted biden was no surprise 
only biden was rivaling dukakis in early fundraising among the 
democratic presidential candidates and was about to get major 
publicity in his role as chairman of the senate judiciary committee 
during hearings on president reagans nomination of robert bork to 
the supreme court 
sassos role with the dukakis campaign was not his first venture 
into presidential politics he had been a field organizer for sen 
edward kennedy dmass in 1980 and also took a leave from 
dukakis staff to manage geraldine ferraros 1984 vice presidential 
campaign 
it was after the walter mondaleferraro ticket was defeated by 
president reagan that sasso began promoting dukakis as a 1988 
presidential contender dukakis at first discouraged such talk 
asking sasso and other aides to focus on his 1986 gubernatorial 
reelection 
in the midst of that campaign sasso began drafting a memo 
encouraging dukakis to run arguing that his record of achievement 
in massachusetts and optimistic approach was a winning combination 
four years after charges of gloom and doom doomed mondale 
when dukakis decided to run he quickly installed sasso as 
campaign manager since his resignation last year sasso has spoken 
to dukakis frequently but has had no formal campaign role he shied 
away from reporters and was described by friends as sullen 
unhappy on the sidelines 
im delighted to be back as part of the general election 
team a beaming sasso said friday because ive always been 
committed to michael dukakis

two humane societies are urging consumers 
to boycott a new stuffed toy called krushed kitty 
the yellowandblack striped toy a cats bottom with hind legs 
and tail is designed to be stuck out of car doors hoods and 
trunks a card attached states that a portion of the profits are 
donated to the humane society 
however phyllis wright a vice president with the washington 
dcbased humane society of the united states denied any 
connection to the item and said she doubts any legitimate humane 
society would take one penny from this 
she and gerri bain of the capital area humane society in 
columbus called on consumers not to buy the stuffed toy which 
retails for 1799 
i think the onus is on the consumer ms wright said 
unless the public responds in a negative way and goes to a store 
and threatens never to buy anything else there because of this 
item nothing will get done 
the attached card does not state how much will be donated nor 
whether the money will go to the national humane society or to 
local humane societies which are privately operated and not 
affiliated with the national organization 
the krushed kritter kompany of kalifornia which lists its 
address as tarzana calif could not be reached to comment friday 
no telephone listing was available 
the toys packaging said the cat parts are registered in at 
least five states ohio maine pennsylvania florida and texas 
the packaging urges the purchaser to krush your kitty in your 
car work or home and to write to the company to tell us your 
favorite place to krush your kitty and vote for who or what you 
would like to see krushed next 
this will do for kittens what jaws did for sharks bain 
said this is not only disgusting and irreverent but it is 
misleading 
i think the best way to stop this disgusting product is for 
consumers to just not buy them let them the manufacturer eat 
their krushed kitties she said

roads rivers and towns were moved or removed on 
soviet maps for 50 years by order of the secret police who were 
trying to throw off aerial bombers and spies the soviet unions 
top cartographer said 
those inaccuracies are now being corrected said the 
cartographer viktor r yashchenko 
people didnt recognize their own homeland on maps 
yashchenko told the government newspaper izvestia in an interview 
published friday tourists in vain tried to orient themselves to 
locations 
yashchenko head of the governments main directorate of 
geodetics and cartography said the falsifications began in the 
1930s under nowdisgraced dictator josef stalin and continued until 
this year 
stalins policy of revising historical records to suit his 
political needs has been severely criticized under soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev 
but yashchenko implied criticism of every successor of stalin in 
saying that skewing of maps continued even after gorbachev took 
power in march 1985 
gorbachev has promoted a policy of glasnost or openness 
that has uncovered previosly taboo subjects known in the soviet 
union as blank spots 
yashchenko said the blank spots on maps were overwhelming and 
that they began when his agency was put under the control of the 
nkvd the predecessor of the kgb state security apparatus 
the atmosphere of mistrust and espionage was reflected on the 
production of cartographers as well he told izvestia 
orders would come down for cartographers to remove from maps 
certain locations or change those of others he recalled 
under stalin airbrushing to remove the faces of purged 
enemies of the people was routine and references to such 
disgraced figures were removed from books newspapers and magazines 
yashchenko said even tourist maps were highly inaccurate 
many foreigners in moscow use a ciaproduced map of the capital 
because sovietmade maps omit many streets 
on the tourist map of moscow the contours of the capital are 
only partly true the map maker said 
he said the absurdity of inaccurate maps had increased in recent 
times when the soviet union has extremely detailed photographs 
taken from satellites in space

mars will move to within about 36 million miles 
of earth this month the closest its been in 17 years and dozens 
of mars watches are planned to view the red planet named for 
the roman god of war 
the planet will come closest to earth on sept 22 but the best 
time to see it is the next few nights said norman warns an 
astronomy professor at south suburban college in south holland a 
chicago suburb 
its a perfect time to see because the moon doesnt come up 
until late at night warns said friday its a definite orange 
bright spot in the southeastern sky at about 10 at night 
the planetary society an amateur astronomy group plans about 
50 mars watches this month said linda low the groups illinois 
regional coordinator thousands of smaller informal mars parties 
also will be held she said 
on saturday outerspace buffs were encouraged to bring mars 
bars and other earthly delights to a mars watch picnic and jazz 
concert at the college 
the last time earth and mars were so close was in 1971 warns 
said he said viewing conditions this time are better because the 
planet is much higher in the sky 
itll appear the brightest during september then itll get 
dimmer as the two planets move away he said 
warns said that unless mars watchers look at the planet through 
a highpowered telescope it might look to some people like a 
star 
you wont see any martians no matter what size telescope you 
have but the larger the telescope you have the more youll see 
he said 
you actually need a small telescope to see a disc and with 
a mediumsize telescope you can actually see surface features 
warns said under favorable conditions you would even see a white 
spot which marks the polar ice cap 
observers also should be on the lookout for dark spots massive 
dust storms on the planet he said 
with a very powerful telescope they might also see the valley 
of the mariner a fivemiledeep twentymilewide canyon that 
would stretch from new york to los angeles if it were on earth 
astrologer del oconnor said even those who pay no attention to 
mars will be affected by it 
she warned that people should be more careful and not make any 
rash decisions because of the unusual influence this month of the 
planet said by astrologers to have high energy 
whatever is going on during this period will happen with 
greater intensity because mars as a planet represents raw energy

a man was convicted of murder despite the 
testimony of two witnesses who identified the interpreter sitting 
beside him as the killer 
jurors deliberated less than 20 minutes thursday before 
convicting mariano medina 45 in the 1986 slaying of pablo 
rodriguez judge miron love sentenced medina to 20 years in prison 
two elderly witnesses had pointed to court interpreter sammy 
garcia as the man they saw gun down rodriguez 
garcia who was seated beside medina through the trial said the 
misidentification reminded him of something you see on perry 
mason 
mike roe the assistant district attorney had stressed in final 
arguments that the witnesses did identify medina in a photo lineup 
shortly after the slaying dont reward him for changing his 
appearance he told the jurors 
roe said that in the past two years medina has lost 20 pounds 
grown a mustache and put on glasses both medina and garcia have 
dark complexions and dark wavy hair 
one of the witnesses had provided police with the license number 
of the car driven by rodriguezs assailant leading authorities to 
medina one of medinas neighbors also testified she saw him load a 
revolver shortly before hearing shots nearby 
prosecutors argued that medina shot rodriguez because he 
suspected him of burglarizing his apartment

us rep stephen j solarz said saturday 
he would meet with government and opposition leaders to see how the 
united states can encourage democracy after 26 years of 
authoritarian rule 
small groups of antigovernment protesters met in the capital 
but there were no rallies after a week of major demonstrations 
against the oneparty rule of the burma socialist program party 
ive come in order to assess the situation and its 
implications for american interest in the region solarz said 
after arriving saturday in rangoon he was reached by telephone 
from bangkok thailand 
solarz said he wanted to see what if anything the united 
states can do to facilitate the peaceful emergence of a genuine 
democracy 
sources said solarz would meet separately with president maung 
maung with aung gyi burmas bestknown dissident who was 
recently freed from a months detention and with tin oo a former 
defense minister who reemerged to lead calls for multiparty 
democracy 
solarz dny chairs the asian and pacific affairs 
subcommittee of the house foreign affairs committee he has spoken 
out against against repressive policies of former philippine 
president ferdinand marcos and the ultraradical khmer rouge that 
ruled cambodia until 1978 
diplomats say the international community has limited influence 
over burma because it is a strictly neutralist nation without close 
allies burma also is extremely sensitive to what it considers to 
be foreign interference 
japan and west germany are the biggest aid donors the united 
states has a relatively modest aerial spraying program aimed 
largely at helping rangoon combat opium production in the socalled 
golden triangle 
hundreds of thousands of people marched through major cities 
friday demanding immediate democracy and rejecting maung maungs 
appeal to be patient in their quest 
students and other protest leaders called for largescale 
demonstrations on sept 8 to press for an interim government to 
oversee the transition to democracy strikes and protests have been 
virtually daily events 
the government has not backed down from its original plan for 
party leaders to meet sept 12 to consider calling for a popular 
vote on ending oneparty rule the protesters want an interim 
government formed before then but maung maung has rejected that 
for constitutional reasons 
burma has been under singleparty rule since gen ne win led the 
1962 military coup that toppled an elected government 
ne win resigned on july 23 and proposed a referendum on ending 
oneparty rule but the party rejected that and picked hardliner 
sein lwin to succeed him 
massive protests followed and by official count at least 112 
people were killed in clashes with security forces in rangoon 
before sein lwin resigned aug 12 
maung maung the first civilian leader in 26 years succeeded 
him a week later lifted martial law and freed political prisoners 
but prodemocracy demonstrations continued and a general strike has 
crippled government services and administration in many areas 
on friday a western diplomat in rangoon cited reports that 
protesters have taken over about 40 town governments in recent 
weeks 
another indication of the breakdown in order has been several 
jail riots after which authorities freed thousands of inmates 
staterun radio rangoon said 486 prisoners were freed saturday in 
the central city of mandalay

president augusto pinochet has seized the 
initiative in a carefully orchestrated campaign for eight more 
years of military rule extending highly publicized olive branches 
to critics of his authoritarian government 
but the chilean opposition remains confident of defeating the 
72yearold army commander at the voting booth in a presidential 
plebiscite scheduled for oct 5 
in two adept moves made 48 hours after fellow military 
commanders nominated him tuesday as sole candidate in a 
presidential referendum pinochet broadcast a conciliatory appeal 
for opposition collaboration and authorized the return of all 430 
remaining political exiles 
leaders of the local roman catholic church lauded both measures 
as helping national reconciliation we have to be truly happy 
with these positive steps said the countrys cardinal juan 
francisco fresno 
it was rare praise from the church hierarchy which has been 
consistently critical of pinochet since he seized power in a bloody 
1973 coup the churchs pronouncements carry much weight with 
chiles predominantly catholic population 
coupled with the lifting last month of all states of emergency 
for the first time since pinochet took power even the opposition 
leaders said chile was moving toward greater political freedom 
they denounced the timing of the actions however as a cynical 
bid for publicity and voter support and they predicted this could 
backfire for the government 
it creates a greater sense of security in the country said 
genaro arriagada general secretary of a 16party opposition 
coalition this could make many pinochet opponents feel safe from 
reprisal if they vote against him in the referendum arriagada said 
the oppositions campaign which consists largely of festive 
rallies and doortodoor visits is focused heavily on overcoming 
fears that citizens might lose government jobs or benefits such as 
housing subsidies if they vote no 
a campaign slogan used extensively by opposition leaders in 
rallies is say yes but vote no 
if pinochet wins a majority in the referendum he begins a new 
eightyear term in march he already has governed the country 
longer than any predecessor 
even if a majority of voters rejects him he will remain 
president until 1990 when open elections will be held elections 
for congress disbanded by pinochet when he seized power are 
planned for the same year 
pinochet trails badly in many polls including those that 
foreign diplomats describe as the most reliable his new attempts 
at the image of peacemaker appear aimed at making headway with the 
many chileans offended by his harsh strongarm image 
pinochet rejects the poll indications favoring progovernment 
surveys that give him a slight edge but even if he were to 
conclude that the opposition held a commanding lead it now appears 
too late to back out and for instance call open elections that 
might split the opposition 
it also appears too late for the opposition despite its 
complaints that the government enjoys an unfair advantage to 
withdraw from the competition 
this referendum is a path from which it would be difficult 
for pinochet to stray arriagada said and to be honest from 
which it would be difficult for us to stray either 
the opposition maintains that pinochet is spending millions of 
dollars in public money on progovernment publicity and providing 
logistical support such as municipal stadiums free of charge to 
political groups campaigning for him 
the propinochet campaigns central message is that a loss in 
the referendum would bring back social and political chaos of the 
early 1970s when an elected marxist salvador allende was 
president allendes government was toppled and he died in the 
1973 coup 
a major antipinochet rally was planned for sunday in santiago 
and organizers say they are doing their best to make sure it and 
future demonstrations are peaceful designating chaperones to keep 
order and control any rowdy groups 
any violence helps pinochet said patricio aylwin leader of 
the centrist christian democratic party the countrys largest and 
official spokesman for the opposition coalition we must do all 
we can to prevent it 
aylwin tried to take the campaign initiative thursday by 
challenging pinochet to a televised debate it was considered 
unlikely the president would agree

president reagan said today he will 
veto any welfare bill sent him by congress that replaces work 
with welfare expansion 
in his weekly radio address delivered from his mountaintop 
ranch north of here the president said the economic expansion 
under his administration has enabled nearly three million americans 
to escape poverty 
but this week we got a warning he added while we learned 
that last year family income went up and that the poverty rate 
dropped slightly we also learned that some groups lagged behind in 
the last year 
there are still some americans whom our expansion has passed 
by those caught in the welfare trap he said 
its time to return hope to those on welfare which is why our 
administration has worked to reform our welfare system the 
president said 
he said nearly half of the 50 states have either instituted or 
proposed experimental welfare plans under an administration program 
designed to foster steps to get people off welfare 
now congress appears to be close to a decision about welfare 
reform he added and i have a message for them i will not 
accept any welfare reform bill unless it is geared to making people 
independent of welfare 
if congress presents me with a bill that replaced work with 
welfare expansion and that places the dignity of selfsufficiency 
through work out of the reach of americans on welfare i will use 
my veto pen he said 
the senate has passed a bill that does contain a work 
requirement but the measure passed by the house does not the two 
bills are being considered by a housesenate conference committee 
while others have talked about good jobs at good wages weve 
delivered the president said now it is time for congress to 
join with us in making sure that the opportunities created by this 
prosperity reach into every american home 
the president began his speech by saying that just yesterday 
we learned that in august as great a proportion of us had jobs as 
ever before 
the labor department reported friday that unemployment rose to 
56 percent in august from 54 percent in july in may 
unemployment had reached a 14year low of 53 percent

radical students demanding that north 
korea be allowed to cohost the olympics pelted police saturday 
with rocks and firebombs but the communist nation said it would 
boycott the games and asked other countries to stay away too 
police carrying iron bars and wooden clubs hurled back rocks and 
unexploded firebombs at about 600 students in the clash at 
sungkyunkwan university in seoul but they used no tear gas because 
of a new government ban 
several protesters and police were injured but authorities had 
no figures for injuries or arrests 
a declaration by the students said if the olympics cannot 
help nurture a desirable atmosphere they are nothing but divisive 
olympics dictatorial olympics and war olympics 
north korea announced saturday it would boycott the sept 
17oct 2 olympics because its demand to be a cohost had been 
rejected it has said for months that it would stay away from the 
games if the demand was not met 
north korea in a report carried by its official korean central 
news agency said the olympics were being used to perpetuate the 
division of the korean peninsula and it urged other nations to 
back its boycott 
for us olympic games are important but more important is the 
future destiny of our entire nation for this reason we cannot 
take part in the olympic games that is forced by singlehanded 
hosting said the report monitored in tokyo 
the agency citing a statement released by the norths olympic 
committee said the games will be crippled by a boycott but 
only cuba and ethiopia have said they will back north korea 
south korean officials fear the north may try to sabotage the 
olympics the two sides see the olympics as a major symbol in their 
struggle for dominance on the divided korean peninsula 
the peninsula was split in 1945 the north invaded the south in 
1950 starting the korean war and the border between the two sides 
remains tense years after the 1953 armistice 
in its announcement saturday north korea lashed out at the 
united states japan and south korea charging they conspired to 
hold the games in seoul to keep the two koreas apart 
by holding the olympiad in seoul they tried to give the 
impression that south korea the complete colony military base 
of the united states was an independent state and legalize the 
occupation of south korea by the us troops 
the formal deadline for entering the olympics expired friday 
but the head of the seoul olympic organizing committee park 
sehjik said earlier saturday that seoul would keep the door open 
until the last day of the olympics for north korea to participate 
the international olympic committee and south korea said the 
games could not be shared because they are given to a single city 
talks last month failed to produce an agreement between the two 
koreas on the olympics 
park also said police would not use tear gas to disperse any 
protests during the olympics because authorities want to avoid 
disruption the gas used by riot police during demonstrations often 
floats into residential and business areas and the government does 
not want to spoil the games 
radicals have threatened protests during the olympics a small 
but powerful minority on campuses they lack widespread public 
support 
opposition leader kim daejung said saturday he doubted that the 
radicals would attempt to disrupt the games the students know 
they will not be supported by our people kim told the associated 
press in an interview 
kim also played down any potential threat from north korea he 
said it would not disrupt the olympics because it would be 
condemned worldwide 
the one serious threat appears to be international terrorists 
some with ties to north korea kim said 
some opposition leaders say the government is being moderate to 
avoid alienating world opinion during the olympics but that it may 
crack down after the games 
but kim said that was unlikely he said president roh taewoo 
assured him wednesday that the military would declare its 
neutrality in politics we have agreed only democracy can solve 
our problems he said 
roh a former general defeated kim and rival opposition leader 
kim youngsam in december presidential elections roh replaced 
former president chun doohwan who took power with military 
backing in 1980 
south korea has been ruled for most of its 40year history by 
authoritarian military and civilian leaders

the government today released 
a convicted irish republican army killer to attend the funeral of 
his brother an ira guerrilla who was slain in a british army 
ambush 
across the province in londonderry family and friends buried 
two people who were killed by an ira bomb and roman catholic 
bishop edward daly said he did not want to hear any more 
apologies from the ira or anyone else 
in crossmaglen meanwhile a town near the border with ireland 
a mortar attack on a military base damaged some nearby buildings 
but caused no injuries police said three mortars exploded and that 
other shells failed to exploded 
earlier today hundreds of police and soldiers in riot gear 
formed an almost unbroken circle around the home of slain ira 
guerrilla brian mullin at sixmilecross 50 miles west of belfast 
before his funeral 
mullins elder brother patrick serving a life sentence for the 
ira murder of a school bus driver was given a days compassionate 
leave to attend the funeral and was released in the custody of a 
local priest and driven from maze prison in belfast by members of 
sinn fein the iras political wing 
patrick mullin was delayed at a security checkpoint and the 
cortege of 2000 mourners did not leave the farm at sixmilecross 
for nearby dunmoyle until about noon one hour later than scheduled 
a previous report said the delay occurred because family members 
demanded the security forces leave the vicinity of the house before 
they would come out 
more than 200 police and soldiers later accompanied the hearse 
carrying mullins coffin which was draped with the irish tricolor 
flag 
mullin was killed along with two other men in an ambush by 
british soldiers police say mullin 26 and brothers gerard harte 
29 and martin harte 21 were known ira members who were armed and 
masked when they were killed at drumnakilly 50 miles west of 
belfast on tuesday 
news reports said the three guerrillas were about to try to kill 
an offduty member of the ulster defense regiment when soldiers 
lying in wait riddled their stolen car with bullets the ira said 
the three men died on active service a euphemism for gun and 
bomb attacks 
the harte brothers were buried friday and mullins funeral was 
scheduled for today before the standoff began between security 
forces and his family 
in londonderry bishop daly presided at the funeral of sean 
dalton 55 and sheila lewis 60 who were killed by a boobytrap 
bomb wednesday when they went to examine the apartment of a 
neighbor they had not seen in several days 
dalton broke into the apartment and triggered a bomb rigged to 
blow up an army squad the ira apologized saying the operation 
went tragically wrong 
daly told the congregation he wanted to hear no more apologies 
before the mullin funeral protestant lawmaker ken maginnis said 
patrick was going to be let out of prison to attend the funeral 
maginnis a member of the protestant official unionist party 
said the british governments northern ireland office told him it 
would allow mullins brother to attend the funeral the office the 
british government department responsible for the provinces 
affairs refused to comment 
patrick mullin is serving a life term for the 1977 killing of 
roman catholic bus driver frank canavan the ira said at the time 
that canavan was mistaken for a parttime member of the ulster 
defense regiment a locally recruited unit of the british army 
the mainly catholic ira which is fighting to end british rule 
in northern ireland apologized for what it called canavans 
tragic death 
it is an absolute scandal that this man patrick mullin who 
is one of a committed ira family should be released or paroled or 
whatever it is called maginnis said the concession for the 
funeral of a terrorist involved in the murder of eight young 
soldiers exactly 14 days ago is a concession to ira terrorism quite 
beyond comprehension 
police arrested brian mullin after an ira bomb blew up a 
military bus on aug 20 killing eight soldiers and injuring 27 
others he was questioned and released after five days without 
being charged 
the bombing occurred at ballygawley eight miles from where 
mullin and the hartes were killed we know he mullin was in the 
same ira unit that carried out the bus bombing maginnis said

oil prices could fall sharply if iran and 
iraq increase production to raise cash for postwar reconstruction 
a glut in world oil supplies drove the price below the 18 a 
barrel level set by the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries even before the aug 20 ceasefire in the persian gulf 
war prices now stand at around 15 a barrel 
opecs efforts to curb output depend on whether it can persuade 
iran and iraq not to use their newly regained export capacity 
the cartel already is plagued by overproduction by some of its 
13 members states mainly iraq and the united arab emirates 
current total output is estimated at around 20 million barrels a 
day around 35 million barrels above the cartels quota ceiling 
opecs secretarygeneral former indonesian energy minister 
subroto recently visited tehran and baghdad to persuade iran to 
allow iraq a quota equal to its own 236 million barrels a day 
thats far less than what both countries pumped before the war 
broke out in september 1980 
iraq refused an earlier opec quota of 154 million barrels a day 
and demanded parity with iran iraq failed to win that during the 
war leading it to pump as much oil as it could about 28 million 
barrels a day 
it is not known how successful subrotos mission was but iraqs 
oil minister issam abdulrahim alchalabi voiced support friday 
for opec and for acceptable and just solutions to the problems 
facing the organization 
iran and iraq desperately need revenues to rebuild their 
economies each depends on oil for about 90 percent of its foreign 
earnings both have both made developing their oil facilities a top 
priority irans longterm production target is 45 million barrels 
a day around its prewar level 
during the war iraqi air raids on irans oil facilities and 
tanker routes forced exports down to an average 15 million barrels 
a day 
irans deputy oil minister khazempour ardebili recently said 
tehran will stick to opec rules for the time being and work to 
prevent overproduction 
repairing iranian oil installations damaged in iraqi air raids 
and in recent months by the us navy warships will take time 
development will cost both states billions of dollars 
iraq could boost its exports by as much as 1 million barrels a 
day within months through makeshift terminals now that its ships 
can sail the gulf again 
during the war iraq built pipelines through turkey and saudi 
arabia that allow it to export about 25 million barrels a day 
another 200000 barrels a day is trucked through jordan and turkey 
another pipeline due for completion next year and reopening its 
gulf ports will push iraqs export capacity to about 55 million 
barrels a day by 1995 oil analysts said 
iraq plans to build a northsouth pipeline within its borders 
repair its southern gulf terminals and develop new oilfields 
it badly needs increased oil revenues to pay off its foreign 
debt estimated at between 70 billion and 85 billion and to 
finance its ambitious development plans the 12 billion to 14 
billion it earns a year from oil make it difficult to do both 
diplomats said 
iran earns around 9 billion annually 
diplomats said iraqs expansion plans are aimed mainly at 
diversifying its oil export lines so it will never again be trapped 
by the closing of its gulf ports and tanker routes as it was at 
the outbreak of the war 
baghdadbased diplomats said they expect iraq second only to 
saudi arabia in oil reserves to try to abide by opec quotas 
largely because it is in iraqs own interests to help hold up oil 
prices 
but several sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
baghdad might be tempted to overproduce if iran does or if oil 
prices and revenues fall so much that its development plans are 
endangered

a secret new spy satellite circled 
the globe in a useless orbit saturday leaving the united states to 
continue relying on aging systems for eavesdropping and warning of 
missile attacks 
the satellite said to be designed for intercepting soviet 
communications was propelled into a successful preliminary orbit 
by a 65 million titan 34d rocket launched here friday 
but a source close to the project said the spacecraft failed to 
achieve a desired stationary orbit 22300 miles high when the upper 
stage of the rocket failed to reignite 
the source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
satellite remained in a sharply elliptical orbit ranging from about 
100 to 22300 miles above earth 
he said the payload was useless on that course and there was 
little hope of salvaging the mission 
the air force as is its custom with military launches did not 
announce the liftoff in advance several minutes after launch with 
the titan apparently working well it reported a successful start 
to the mission 
asked about the reported failure air force lt col ron rand 
director of public affairs at the eastern space and missile center 
here said the pentagon had a policy of not commenting on the 
results of military space flights 
john e pike a space policy expert for the washingtonbased 
federation of american scientists said the satellite was 
codenamed vortex a series designed to monitor soviet missile 
tests and military and diplomatic electronic communications 
it was intended to replace a satellite that has been in use for 
several years and is showing signs of wear the source reported 
aging is a problem with many of americas military satellites 
and is causing concern among military planners who over the last 
two decades have relied heavily on spacebased systems for 
reconnaissance communications electronic eavesdropping 
missileattack alert and navigation 
since the space shuttle challenger explosion and a titan 34d 
blowup both in early 1986 the pentagon has been limited in its 
ability to lift heavy satellites into orbit to replace older 
systems many of which continue to operate long past their 
anticipated operational lifetimes 
the titan 34d the united states most powerful unmanned rocket 
was grounded for redesign for 18 months following its 1986 failure 
flights resumed late last year with two straight successes 
deployment of reconnaissance and missile attack warning satellites 
the only two heavy us military payloads launched successfully in 
the last 2 years 
fridays launch was the first for the titan 34d since those 1987 
flights and it had been delayed several months by technical 
problems 
only three more titan 34ds remain in the inventory with the 
rocket to be replaced starting later this year by the more powerful 
titan 4 
the redesigned space shuttle is scheduled to resume flights late 
this month or in early october and the pentagon has booked 
critically needed military satellites on five of the first nine 
missions 
even before challenger the defense department realized it was 
depending too much on the shuttle for access to space and began 
developing the titan 4 over the objection of the national 
aeronautics and space administration 
the air force is shepherding the construction of 50 titan 4s and 
a large number of smaller delta 2s and titan 2s to launch a family 
of military satellites over the next several years gradually 
cutting back on its use of the shuttle

a quarter million schoolage children across 
america wont be returning to the classroom this month 
instead theyll learn reading writing and arithmetic at the 
same table where they eat breakfast and mom and dad will be the 
teachers 
the us department of education estimates more than 260000 
children are being taught at home more than twice as many as in 
1985 primarily for religious reasons 
other motivations range from doubt about the abilities of public 
school teachers to shielding children from peer pressure 
i see it as a reaction of one part of the population to the 
overinstitutionalization of the child said patricia lines a 
research analyst at the department of education 
red balfour who heads a homeschooling program for orange 
county in southern california said he gets at least five calls a 
day from parents interested in the growing movement 
parents taking such action could face legal problems some 
states do not have statutes that specifically address the practice 
and disputes have developed over who is qualified to teach their 
children at home 
the home school legal defense association based in great falls 
va provides legal advice and representation to its more than 
9000 members said attorney j michael smith the groups vice 
president 
smith said his group intervened in two cases during the 198788 
academic year and both were dismissed in court 
a couple in the covina valley district east of los angeles lost 
a case last year in which officials claimed the child didnt have 
structured lessons the district also complained the parents had 
only a high school education 
in california where some 2100 home schools are registered 
requirements for home teaching are vague said fred fernandez 
consultant for nonpublic schools at the state department of 
education no statute provides guidelines for home teaching the 
law mandates only that instructors be capable of teaching he 
said 
micki and j david colfax of rural boonville have become 
national heroes in the home school movement their oldest son 
23yearold grant graduated magna cum laude from harvard in 1987 
and his brothers drew 20 and reed 18 now attend the university 
i think public schools especially high school age children 
are mostly a holding operation mrs colfax said i think 
theres an enormous waste of time 
the colfaxes both former teachers began teaching their 
children in 1973 when they moved to a ranch about 100 miles north 
of san francisco mrs colfax said she wasnt impressed with the 
public education in the area 
parents who choose to keep their children at home for religious 
reasons point to the teachings of veteran educator raymond moore 
who runs the hewitt research foundation in washougal wash 
his foundation supplies lesson plans for more than 5000 
students who he claims average significantly higher on 
standardized achievement tests than the public school norm 
ms lines said federal data on students taught at home confirm 
moores claim 
home schoolers enjoy tremendous advantages moore said 
they are positively socialized instead of being peerdependent 
narcissistically socialized 
moore who often appears on christian broadcasts said bad 
teaching is the enemy not public schools 
sharon weir a seventh day adventist from downey calif said 
she taught her two older daughters at home during their early 
elementary years and plans to teach her 4yearold when she reaches 
school age 
i wanted to keep my children away from any negative 
influences she said when youre homeschooling its just the 
mother and child onetoone you know if your child is getting the 
material 
support groups have sprung up throughout the country for parents 
to meet and exchange ideas and for children to have an opportunity 
to interact with each other 
gary mcintire 7 of yorba linda calif is one of a few dozen 
children in rainbow kids a group made up of hometaught youngsters 
and their parents who meet once a week to work on projects or go on 
field trips 
his mother sue mcintire said she prefers to teach him at home 
because she doesnt like the socialization that children face at 
public schools and she believes gary can learn better with the 
special attention 
where hes strong we can go at the speed hes ready for and 
where hes not we can slow down she said

about 90000 kurdish refugees many sick 
and exhausted have fled fighting in iraq and resettled with 
bedding and household utensils under trees in turkish camps 
they are huddled along small treelined creeks with their sheep 
and goats grazing nearby in eight encampments along a 60mile strip 
near the iraqi border 
many children and old people are suffering from exhaustion and 
diarrhea said doctors screening the refugees saturday 
next week turkey will start moving the refugees about 60 miles 
inland to tent cities being set up north of the syrian border in 
diyarbakir province and near the cizre and silopi townships local 
officials said saturday 
thirty trucks to be used in the move have been sent to a camp 
near cukurca known as cukurca yayla where 11000 refugees have 
taken shelter said town mayor macit piruzbeyoglu 
the doctors who spoke on condition of anonymity said 18 people 
died in the cukurca yayla camp on friday they did not appear to be 
victims of chemical bombs the doctors said but relatives would 
not allow autopsies so it was not possible to know for sure 
kurds in northern iraq have been fighting for an independent 
homeland and received help from iran during the eightyear 
iraniraq war soon after the warring nations agreed to a 
ceasefire on aug 20 iraq launched an offensive against the 
kurdish guerrillas known as peshmergas 
about 20 million kurds live in the mountains where the borders 
of turkey iran and iraq meet and syria and the soviet union also 
have small kurdish enclaves about 35 million kurds live in iraq 
the iraqi refugees say they fled when iraqis dropped mustard gas 
bombs outlawed under international accords 
serbest omar 25 carrying a gas mask said on the way over 
i personally buried 15 dead from our group 
some died from hunger and illness and others from chemical 
bombs he said 
he said only 800 of the 1300 residents of tirvanish his village 
in the dohuk township of northern iraq had survived 
amnesty international has backed up the kurdish charges saying 
iraqis have used chemical weapons against them in a campaign of 
extermination 
iraq has denied using chemical weapons against the kurds though 
it has said it was provoked to use them against iran after iran 
used them first iraq considers the refugees traitors who 
collaborated with iran during the war 
ahmed mohammed 35 from another village in dohuk township said 
refugees waited four days while the iraqi army blocked their way 
they slipped through the blockade at night and then walked six days 
to the turkish border he said 
his mother and father died en route he said 
the refugees in the cukurca yayla camp have separated into 
groups of nine or 10 people each group taking shelter under a tree 
women make flat bread from flour distributed by the turkish 
government and brew tea some of the refugees cut down tree 
branches to make hammocks and rock little children to sleep on them 
turkey announced wednesday it would accept the refugees 
temporarily on humanitarian grounds the refugees and local 
officials say the influx started earlier 
they started coming in the middle of august said mayor 
piruzbeyoglu he said groups of refugees had previously crossed 
into turkey in 1962 and 1975 during heavy fighting between the 
iraqi army and the kurds but he said the numbers were much smaller 
then 
turkey hesitated to accept the refugees because its military is 
fighting its own battle in southeastern turkey with guerrillas 
known as the kurdish labor party 
the rebels who want to set up an independent marxist kurdish 
state are not popular with the 10 million kurdish residents of the 
region the guerrillas have slain several hundred villagers whom 
they accused of cooperating with government forces 
since 1984 about 700 troops and 700 guerrillas have died in the 
struggle 
premier turgut ozals decision to give refuge to the iraqi kurds 
has boosted his popularity among kurdish residents in the 
southeast many of whom have relatives among the refugees local 
politicians say 
this could serve him well in a sept 25 referendum on a 
constitutional amendment to move up the date of municipal elections 
officials also hope the move will improve turkeys image in the 
west ozal has said turkeys refugee policy is the best answer to

jennifer mcjunkin put up with three years 
of struggling with food stuck between her braces and knew just what 
she needed on her menu practically chewless chili and tin grin 
torte 
those recipes and many others went into ms mcjunkins teen 
cuisine a cookbook for young people who wear orthodontic braces 
orthodontists always tell you what you cant eat but they 
never tell you what you can and thats what were trying to do 
here said ms mcjunkin now 20 and a junior at drew university 
here 
ms mcjunkin isnt the first one in her family to do battle with 
braces nor the first one to cook up a solution her parents 
published a cookbook for adults with braces after her mother wore 
them for several years 
a lot of foods are so hard to eat because theyre crunchy and 
hard ms mcjunkin said a lot of things get stuck in your 
teeth like salad and corn these are alternatives to those 
the cookbook also is designed to help wearers avoid food that 
bend their braces or pulls the hardware from their mouths it 
emphasizes soft foods such as pasta and some recipes rely on 
chopped pureed or softened ingredients 
in addition to the chili and torte the 66page book lists such 
gourmet choices as painless pizza soup and metal mouth munchies a 
mild and gentle snack of chex cereal softened with margarine 
and teriyaki or worcestershire sauce 
most of the recipes came from her family including aunt 
genevas foolproof fudge cousin dereks cereal sundae and 
jennifers favorite lemon bars 
ms mcjunkin said she spent 2 years testing the recipes on 
every braceswearing person she knew 
ms mcjunkin was a fifthgrader when she got braces to correct 
an overbite and a gap between two front teeth even worse her 
family had just moved to indiana 
it was awful to be the new girl and to have braces she 
said i really felt i kind of stuck out in the crowd i told my 
mother that id never smile again 
the mcjunkins discussed the cookbook idea with the familys 
orthodontist who offered the manuscript to straight status inc of 
new castle ind which produces greeting cards stationery and 
novelty items for orthodontists dentists and their patients 
the cookbook came off the press in january it is being 
distributed by the mail order company and may soon be available in 
hospital gift shops and book stores

president reagan warned saturday 
that he will veto any welfare legislation congress sends him that 
does not contain a work requirement 
the best way to learn to work is to work the president said 
in a labor day weekend radio address from his vacation ranch 20 
miles north of here 
rep thomas j downey dny in the democrats response said 
that quiring welfare recipients work may be necessary but he said 
such requirements should be controlled by state and local welfare 
officials not the federal government 
reagan mingled talk of welfare reform with celebration of his 
administrations economic record saying fridays unemployment 
figures showed that the jobless rate hovered just above the 
lowest its been in 14 years 
the figures from the labor department showed unemployment of 56 
percent up from 54 percent in july and from the may figure of 53 
per cent which was a 14year low 
but there are still some americans whom our expansion has 
passed by those caught in the welfare trap he said 
to deal with this he said his administration launched a 
program encouraging states to come up with their own plans to get 
people off the welfare rolls 
nearly half of the states have implemented or proposed 
widespread welfare reform plans that build upon some good old 
common sense that the best way to learn to work is to work the 
president said 
now congress appears to be close to a decision about welfare 
reform and i have a message for them he said i will not 
accept any welfare reform bill unless it is geared to making people 
independent of welfare 
a housesenate conference committee currently has before it a 
senatepassed bill that contains a work requirement and a 
houseapproved measure that does not 
any bill not built around work is not true welfare reform 
the president said if congress presents me with a bill that 
replaces work with welfare expansion and that places the dignity of 
selfsufficiency through work out of the reach of americans on 
welfare i will use my veto pen 
downey said that while more people than ever before are working 
the fact is that the typical worker in america is no better off 
today than he or she was 10 years ago in fact things have gotten 
worse 
the poorest 40 percent of american families with incomes 
adjusted for inflation are worse off today than they were 10 years 
ago the richest 5 percent are better off than they were a decade 
ago and 325 million americans remain mired in poverty he said 
the house bill with training and education programs as well as 
health and childcare benefits would make welfare parents who work 
better off than those who do not said downey acting chairman of 
the ways and means subcommittee on public assistance and 
unemployment compensation 
yes requiring a welfare recipient to work may be necessary 
but those requirements should be controlled by state and local 
officials who administer our welfare programs not federal 
bureaucrats downey said

the justice minister asked a local prosecutor 
saturday to file charges against extremeright leader jeanmarie le 
pen for making a play on words linking a cabinet ministers name to 
nazi death camp ovens 
le pen refused to apologize for his remark saying it was up to 
others to judge if the pun was in good taste or not 
justice minister pierre arpaillange said le pen should be 
prosecuted under an 1881 law that makes it a criminal offense to 
insult a cabinet minister a ministry statement said 
local prosecutors work under the justice ministrys direction 
and while the minister does not have authority to order a 
prosecution his wishes are unlikely to be disregarded 
le pens reference to michel durafour minister for the public 
service in the government of socialist premier michel rocard as 
durafourcrematoire brought criticism and revulsion from 
politicians jewish organizations and civil rights groups 
four is the french word for oven and the crematoriums of 
nazi death camps are called fourscrematoires in french 
durafour said he had an infinite amount of contempt for le 
pen leader of the extremeright national front who won 14 percent 
of the vote in presidential elections april 24 
i can see he regrets the passing of the good old days of the 
nazis and wishes he could see them come again durafour said 
le pen replied at a news conference in that case mr 
durafour is not just an imbecile but a dirty bum as well 
as for his pun le pen said everyone can judge for himself 
whether it was in good taste or not its not my problem 
le pen who had fallen out of the political spotlight in recent 
months got the attention back friday in a speech to a national 
front rally he made repeated sarcastic references to durafour a 
centrist who served as a cabinet minister in conservative 
governments in the 1970s 
durafour has said he decided to accept a post in rocards 
socialistled government in part because of the rising influence of 
the national front on the right he has been outspoken in calling 
for all other political parties to refuse electoral alliances with 
le pen 
the antiracism group sosracism issued a statement saying le 
pen continues to blow on the flames of antisemitism in our 
country 
henri bulawko vice president of the representative council of 
jewish organizations of france said le pen carried away by his 
fantasies did not hesitate to insult the memory of the victims of 
nazism 
politicians from the right and the left joined in blasting le 
pens remark 
there are things one cannot let go there are words with which 
one does not make jokes said alain juppe secretarygeneral of 
the conservative rally for the republic party 
mr le pen is showing what he is at heart a racist and an 
antisemite said jeanjack queyranne spokesman for the socialist 
party 
the leftist newspaper liberation and the rightist le figaro used 
identical frontpage headlines saturday le pen does it again 
last year le pen drew harsh criticism for calling the nazi gas 
chambers a detail of world war ii history he is often accused 
of being racist and antisemitic but denies the charges saying he 
is simply profrench 
le pens voting strength poses a delicate problem for the 
rightist and centrist parties especially in municipal elections 
next spring 
control of dozens of cities and regional councils could depend 
on whether the national front supports centerright candidates or 
opposes them if the national front splits the traditional rightist 
vote the socialists and communists could win large numbers of city 
council posts and mayoral races 
national front leaders have been calling for an open alliance 
with the right 
but many conservative leaders say their parties will do better 
if they ignore le pen and hope his backers come around while 
others support making local tactical pacts with the national front 
to keep the left out of power 
leftist leaders have urged the traditional right to make a clean 
break with le pen

the cleveland national air show opened saturday 
with heightened safety rules in effect to protect spectators in the 
aftermath of the west german air show disaster 
the coast guard banned boats from the lakefront area during 
performances running through labor day along lake erie 
the federal aviation administration even before the aug 28 
disaster required highspeed aircraft at air shows to operate at 
least 1500 feet from spectators that will put aircraft several 
hundred feet out over the lake this weekend 
organizers gathered an array of vintage and latemodel aircraft 
for the citys 59th air show including the british supersonic 
concorde the b1b bomber a sail plane the harrier vertical 
takeoff jet fighter radiocontrolled models and the 12footlong 
bd5 jet the worlds smallest 
the navys blue angels precision flying team will take part 
a spokesman for the blue angels whose performances highlight 
each afternoon of the show said there had not been unusual public 
interest in the teams appearance despite the disaster at ramstein 
west germany 
in that disaster three italian jets collided during a 
highspeed stunt sending a flaming aircraft plunging into the 
crowd of 300000 fiftyone people died 15 remain unaccounted for 
and more than 160 are hospitalized 
one of the newest members of the blue angels lt cmdr mark 
ziegler prepared for the weekend performances with two days of 
practice flights across the lakefront 
ziegler an 11year navy veteran who joined the blue angels in 
october said their maneuvers with a maximum of six planes in the 
air at a time were breathtaking but less risky than the 10plane 
threedirection maneuver that ended in disaster at ramstein 
theres no risk i perceive in this at all he said noting 
that the blue angels have clear air space for every maneuver 
allowing pilots room to operate if one of their fa18 hornets or a 
pilot has a problem 
even a maneuver designed to appear as though two aircraft are 
flying straight at one another at twice the speed of sound actually 
has them 200 feet apart on opposite sides of a runway he said 
such tactics intended to make a maneuver look risky without 
taking a major risk are called cheats among the units 16 
officers and 95 enlisted personnel who are based at pensacola fla

republican george bush said saturday he is 
standing firm on his proposal for just two presidential debates 
even though democratic rival michael dukakis whom he called a 
better debater wants three 
weve made a strong proposal that calls for two debates at 
this level and one at the vice presidential level and were going 
to stay with it bush told reporters i think its the right 
amount of this kind of campaign activity 
so far the bush and duakakis camps have been unable to agree on 
debate details with a deadlock over timing and number of debates 
bush forces insist on no more than two debates to be held between 
sept 25 and oct 17 
bush labeled the democratic presidential nominee a good 
debater and recalled dukakis role in moderating the public 
broadcasting system televison debate show the advocates from 
197173 
hes probably a better debater bush told reporters he had 
invited to lunch at his residence at the us naval observatory 
he added quickly tongueincheek im lowering 
expectations my wife barbara when i practice debating she 
falls asleep and ive got to do something different about that 
barbara bush who was sitting on the grass among reporters at 
the outdoor news conference told reporters bushs comments were 
not true 
bush who had no campaign events scheduled saturday or sunday 
begins a weeklong campaign swing on monday with several labor day 
events planned in san diego and los angeles the vice president 
said he would stress the economy and jobs in his labor day 
appearances 
on another subject bush said he was not concerned over 
disclosures that the political consulting firm of stuart spencer 
had been paid more than 350000 in l985 and 1986 to assist the 
panamanian government headed by gen manuel antonio noriega 
spencer is the chief political strategist for indiana sen dan 
quayle bushs running mate 
panamas a friendly country bush declared and as he 
spencer made clear i think eric arturo delvalle was the 
president under which he was hired so i have no concerns about 
that and i think he explained it pretty well 
delvalle the former civilian president of panama was 
handpicked by noriega to run the country but was ousted by noriega 
in february bush did not elaborate on whether he thinks panama is 
still a friendly country 
responding to reporters questions bush said that while he 
disagreed strongly with dukakis veto of a massachusetts bill 
requiring teachers to lead students in the pledge of allegiance he 
would not propose such a law nationally 
i happen to be a federalist bush said suggesting that 
such matters should be left up to the states 
when asked whether he would favor state laws that might punish 
teachers including jail sentences for refusing to lead students 
in the pledge bush said 
i dont know if its a jail offense i think each state should 
make that determination certainly so im not advocating putting 
any teachers in jail what i am advocating is what i think of as 
a fundamental value that teachers ought to lead the kids in the 
pledge of allegiance 
when pressed on the matter and asked why he wouldnt advocate 
jail terms for teachers who refused to follow such laws bush 
snapped im not going to make any punishment i told you im 
going to leave this matter to the states i think states should 
support their own laws thats all that i have to say on that one 
dukakis has said he vetoed the massachusetts legislation after 
being told by the state supreme court and other legal advisers that 
it was unconstitutional bush has said dukakis should have signed 
it anyway

a machinists official said the union will fight a 
federal appeals court ruling allowing eastern airlines to lay off 
4000 employees as soon as the moneylosing carrier posts a 47 
million bond 
this is not the end of the world bob taylor head of 
easterns machinists local in atlanta said of the us court of 
appeals ruling friday night i still feel confident that we will 
be proven right in a higher court 
the court in washington dc granted easterns request to set 
aside an injunction barring the layoffs said clark onstad a vice 
president at easterns parent company texas air corp of houston 
eastern lawyer john j gallagher in washington said it was 
unclear when the carrier could post the amount and begin layoffs 
miamibased eastern has lost about 1 billion in the past decade 
it has been locked in battle with its unions to cut labor costs 
which the airline contends are responsible for its losses the 
machinists are to vote sept 15 on a company proposal for 161 
million in annual wage concessions 
unions contend texas air is cannibalizing eastern in favor of 
the companys nonunion continental airlines 
eastern planned to layoff the workers and eliminate service to 
14 cities last week to help return to profitability 
the unions sued and us district judge barrington parker ruled 
tuesday in washington that eastern could reduce its flight schedule 
by 12 percent as planned but could not undertake mass layoffs 
without negotiating with its unions 
eastern appealed and its request was granted by judges james l 
buckley and stephen f williams of the us court of appeals 
as we hoped the court of appeals wasted no time in 
overturning the order of the lower court which we believed was 
wrong as a matter of law said eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak 
eastern contended a federal judge should not be able to restrict 
managements ability to make costcutting moves it deems necessary 
the layoffs had been scheduled to take effect wednesday when 
the service was dropped employees in kansas city mo atlanta and 
the metropolitan new york area were to be the most seriously 
affected 
eastern eliminated its hub at kansas city and sharply curtailed 
service to the west remaining are its routes in the east the 
caribbean and south america

here is the text of president 
reagans weekly radio address delivered saturday 
my fellow americans labor day weekend is a time to remember the 
importance of work and family in our nations life and on this 
labor day we americans have much to remember and to give thanks 
for 
yes today more of us have jobs than ever before and just 
yesterday we learned that in august as great a proportion of us 
have jobs as ever before and that the unemployment rate hovered 
just above the lowest its been in 14 years 
since our recovery began america has created more than 175 
million jobs 25 times more jobs than france britain germany 
italy canada and japan put together our expansion has created 
jobs in nearly all sectors of the economy more than a million in 
manufacturing more than a million in construction millions more 
still in services from banking and insurance to computer 
programming 
and you can find these new jobs in every region from the 
industrial midwest where new industries are springing up and old 
industries are running at full capacity to the south where the 
economy is strong and getting stronger to our coasts where our 
success in opening international markets is helping america export 
more than ever before in history and these rising exports and the 
declining trade imbalance will create even more jobs all around the 
nation in the months ahead 
but not only do we have more jobs we have better jobs at better 
pay on average the jobs created in our expansion pay more and 
require a higher level of skills than the jobs that existed when 
our expansion began 
this is just one of the reasons why if your family is like most 
families between 1977 and 1981 after taking out the skyhigh 
inflation of those years you saw your income fall almost seven 
percent but since 1981 that is since the year we came to office 
your real income has soared more than ten percent 
to give one example of what this means in the year we took 
office the average family made only about 70 percent of what it 
needed to buy a new home today that family makes 110 percent of 
what it needs and it can afford to buy the house 
leaders all over the world have asked how we achieved this 
growth and prosperity well my answer is simple less government 
more freedom and moving toward a more open and equitable 
international economy 
thanks to our expansion nearly 3 million americans have escaped 
poverty but this week we got a warning while we learned that last 
year family income went up and that the poverty rate dropped 
slightly we also learned that some groups lagged behind in the 
past year weve assisted many of our fellow citizens through the 
job training partnership act sponsored chiefly by senator dan 
quayle this legislation has been very effective in retraining 
citizens to become productive wage earners again 
but there are still some americans whom our expansion has passed 
by those caught in the welfare trap programs that were intended 
to help poor citizens have instead made them dependent on 
government checks unable to break away and become productive 
workers in a growing economy in the name of compassion too many 
americans on welfare have been robbed of the one priceless item 
with which they could build a future hope 
its time to return hope to those on welfare which is why our 
administration has worked to reform the welfare system for 
starters we took a simple principle that washington doesnt know 
everything and instead of dictating reforms we told the 50 
states that wed approve any experiment intended to reduce 
dependency our only conditions that needs would continue to be 
met that thered be no net increase in federal costs and that 
results could be measured one state after another responded until 
now nearly half of the states have implemented or proposed 
widespread welfare reform plans that build upon some good old 
common sense that the best way to learn to work is to work 
our administration is trying to join with congress to take what 
weve learned with the states and establish work requirements into 
the federal law now congress appears to be close to a decision 
about welfare reform and i have a message for them i will not 
accept any welfare reform bill unless it is geared to making people 
independent of welfare any bill not built around work is not true 
welfare reform if congress presents me with a bill that replaces 
work with welfare expansion and that places the dignity of 
selfsufficiency through work out of the reach of americans on 
welfare i will use my veto pen 
while others have talked about good jobs and good wages weve 
delivered now its time for congress to join with us in making 
sure that the opportunities created by this prosperity reach into 
every american home until next week thanks for listening and god 
bless you

here is the text of the democratic response 
delivered saturday to president reagans weekly radio address the 
speech was delivered by rep tom downey dny 
this is congressman tom downey from long island new york this 
weekend we celebrate the working men and women of america and their 
families who have done so much to make this country great 
just as we began the summer by commemorating those who gave 
their lives to defend our nation it is fitting that we close by 
honoring the accomplishments of those who work so hard to make this 
nation worth defending 
american workers have toiled long and hard to produce what we 
enjoy today they have bent their backs and their minds to whatever 
tasks were at hand they built the roads tamed the plains raised 
the great cities and along the way they stopped to raise their 
families educate their children and create a strong sense of 
national pride 
no one has done more for the working men and women of this 
country than the democratic party we have fought for the right to 
organize and bargain collectively the struggle for a fair days 
wage for a fair days work was the democratic struggle the 
democratic party led the fight to improve working conditions and to 
make health and safety a primary concern in the workplace the 
democratic party has worked with working men and women for improved 
education for affordable housing for better healthcare and for a 
strong national defense 
together we have achieved a great deal but there is much that 
remains to be done today there over 115 million of us working 
never before have so many of us been working and we are justly 
proud of that fact but we ask whether all of us are better off 
today 
not too long ago president reagan reminded us that facts are 
stubborn things and just this week the census bureau released 
the figures on wealth and poverty for 1987 the results are 
disappointing for working americans 
the fact is that the typical worker in america is no better off 
today than he or she was ten years ago in fact things have gotten 
worse the gap between the rich and the working poor threatens to 
become a chasm since the census bureau began collecting income 
data in 1947 the gap between rich and poor families has never been 
so great the fact is that adjusted for inflation the poorest 40 
percent of american families are worse off today than they were ten 
years ago at the same time the richest five percent are better 
off today than they were ten years ago by an average of over 
16000 
we must wonder why an administration which prides itself on 
producing so much wealth has such a dismal record when it comes to 
working people the facts tell us that five years of the 
presidents economic boom has done nothing to reduce poverty in the 
united states despite a low unemployment rate 325 million 
americans remain mired in poverty imagine everyone living in the 
states of pennsylvania missouri florida and arizona being poor 
thats what 32 million people represent 
in fact the poverty rate is higher than at any time in the 70s 
in 1987 there were 8 million more poor americans than there were 
in 1978 clearly economic growth alone will not help these people 
these census figures reveal that there are a million and a half 
more children living in poverty now than there were when president 
reagan was elected in 1980 today one child out of every five lives 
in poverty that is unacceptable 
tragically poverty rates have been higher on average during 
president reagans administration than they were in the nixon 
ford or carter administrations this president has done less than 
any other recent president to help those who are struggling so hard 
to make their way is it any wonder that so many people believe 
this adminstration has turned its back on the working poor of this 
country 
democrats are concerned about those americans who are working 
hard to provide a good life for their families democrats in both 
the house and senate have passed a family welfare reform bill that 
helps poor families move off welfare this bill would give families 
the training and education they need to find work the bill would 
also provide health and childcare benefits so that they can keep 
the jobs they find 
democrats believe in the simple proposition that work should 
make a person better off this bill provides incentives so that 
welfare parents who work are better off than those who do not 
unfortunately this administration seems more eager to punish 
the poor yes requiring a welfare recipient to work may be 
necessary but those requirements should be controlled by state and 
local officials who administer our welfare programs not federal 
bureaucrats 
this bill is paid for we have compromised and walked the 
additional mile to gain the presidents support on behalf of those 
mothers who are struggling to care for their children and get off 
welfare i strongly urge the president to help us pass the 
compromise version of this bill and put more american families to 
work

president reagan warned saturday 
that he will veto any welfare legislation congress sends him that 
does not contain a work requirement 
the best way to learn to work is to work the president said 
in a labor day weekend radio address from his vacation ranch 20 
miles north of here 
rep thomas j downey dny in the democrats response said 
that requiring welfare recipients work may be necessary but he 
said such requirements should be controlled by state and local 
welfare officials not the federal government 
reagan mingled talk of welfare reform with celebration of his 
administrations economic record saying fridays unemployment 
figures showed that the jobless rate hovered just above the 
lowest its been in 14 years 
the figures from the labor department showed unemployment of 56 
percent up from 54 percent in july and from the may figure of 53 
per cent which was a 14year low 
but there are still some americans whom our expansion has 
passed by those caught in the welfare trap he said 
to deal with this he said his administration launched a 
program encouraging states to come up with their own plans to get 
people off the welfare rolls 
nearly half of the states have implemented or proposed 
widespread welfare reform plans that build upon some good old 
common sense that the best way to learn to work is to work the 
president said 
now congress appears to be close to a decision about welfare 
reform and i have a message for them he said i will not 
accept any welfare reform bill unless it is geared to making people 
independent of welfare 
a housesenate conference committee currently has before it a 
senatepassed bill that contains a work requirement and a 
houseapproved measure that does not 
any bill not built around work is not true welfare reform 
the president said if congress presents me with a bill that 
replaces work with welfare expansion and that places the dignity of 
selfsufficiency through work out of the reach of americans on 
welfare i will use my veto pen 
downey said that while more people than ever before are working 
the fact is that the typical worker in america is no better off 
today than he or she was 10 years ago in fact things have gotten 
worse 
the poorest 40 percent of american families with incomes 
adjusted for inflation are worse off today than they were 10 years 
ago the richest 5 percent are better off than they were a decade 
ago and 325 million americans remain mired in poverty he said 
the house bill with training and education programs as well as 
health and childcare benefits would make welfare parents who work 
better off than those who do not said downey acting chairman of 
the ways and means subcommittee on public assistance and 
unemployment compensation 
yes requiring a welfare recipient to work may be necessary 
but those requirements should be controlled by state and local 
officials who administer our welfare programs not federal 
bureaucrats downey said

solidarity leader lech walesa succeeded in 
stopping polands strongest wave of strikes in seven years saturday 
when 250 coal miners ended a sitin and 2400 bus and dock workers 
cut short a strike 
the 19day wave of strikes which involved 100000 employees 
nationwide ended in a whirlwind of appeals and armtwisting 
walesa urged supporters to end local disputes so that promised 
roundtable talks could begin on union pluralism and legalizing 
solidarity 
the labor unrest was the strongest challenge to communist 
authorities since they crushed the soviet blocs first independent 
labor federation with the 1981 martial law crackdown 
walesa said the strikes were a warning to authorities to meet 
workers demands and that if they fail all this will be repeated 
again stronger and more dangerous and that problem will be 
even more difficult to solve 
walesa said he had had to convince the striking miners that 
despite everything polish problems can be resolved only when the 
hand is outstretched for reconciliation 
strikers at the july manifesto coal mine near the southern town 
of jastrzebie where the nationwide strikes began aug 16 carried 
a solidarity banner as they marched out in a steady rain at about 6 
am after 15 hours of negotiations among walesa strikers and 
management 
in the baltic port city of szczecin about 1800 dock workers 
abandoned a strike at 1215 pm and 600 bus workers about an hour 
earlier the port and the citys main bus depot had been occupied 
by strikers since aug 17 
during the strikes polands two biggest ports were virtually 
shut down and production of coal from the silesia region a vital 
source of hard currency was sharply reduced authorities claimed 
losses of tens of millions of dollars 
police ended some strikes but the final breakthrough came when 
the government agreed to the first highlevel meeting between 
walesa and authorities since 1982 
after that meeting wednesday and the promise of further talks 
walesa put his personal reputation on the line to end the strikes 
despite opposition from many strikers 
solidarity and authorities are readying lists of proposed 
participants for the roundtable which could start any day said 
roman catholic mediator jacek ambroziak in warsaw 
lech is really pushing for it he would like talks to begin 
next week and hopes to be ready then said solidarity adviser the 
rev henryk jankowski of gdansk who returned saturday with walesa 
from jastrzebie 
weary unshaven miners walked two miles in the rain to a church 
where a priest celebrated mass for strikers their families and 
supporters from other mines they carried their belongings in 
plastic bags and sang the national anthem 
miners from other jastrzebiearea mines awaited the strikers at 
the church and chanted thank you thank you 
everybody was very nervous throughout but all the strikers 
acted responsibly and thats the most important thing said 
grzegorz stawski a member of the strike committee walesa helped 
us out a lot he helped map the way out of our situation 
miners had demanded that walesa come in person and explain why 
they should end their stoppage and when he arrived the discussions 
were very hot and tense said jankowski 
guaranteeing strike organizers would not be fired was the last 
stumbling block in talks to end the strike said jan litynski a 
solidarity adviser who was at the mine 
the strike ended exactly eight years after the government signed 
accords with striking coal miners in jastrzebie during the upheaval 
that gave rise to solidarity 
a string of police vehicles pulled out of the city saturday 
morning road blocks were dismantled and no strike banners remained 
at the mine 
port and transit workers in szczecin offered early friday 
evening to stop their strikes as soon as job security was 
guaranteed for strikers at the bus depot said strike committee 
member artur balasz 
management said it would meet the demands but then withdrew its 
promise he said but workers decided to leave the port and 
strikebound bus terminal anyway and await walesas talks with the 
government 
we state that we will continue our struggle workers said in 
a communique issued by the committee 
balasz said the workers ended their strike as an expression of 
support for lech walesa we just wanted to follow his suggestions 
shipyard and port workers in gdansk and steel workers in the 
southeastern city of stalowa wola ended strikes thursday after the 
appeal from walesa 
on wednesday during walesas first meeting with senior 
authorities since 1982 interior minister czeslaw kiszczak and 
alternate politburo member stanislaw ciosek agreed to discuss the 
unions future and other issues at the roundtable as soon as 
strikes ended church and representatives of official trade unions 
were also expected to take part said solidarity sources 
miners at the july manifesto mine started the wave of strikes 
disgruntled by paychecks that they said fell short of promises 
they demanded better working conditions and higher wages to 
compensate for inflation of about 60 percent 
but like other strikers around the country who quickly joined 
the strikes their no 1 demand became legalization of solidarity 
communist authorities guaranteed the right to free trade unions 
in an agreement signed aug 31 1980 in gdansk opening the way to 
legal registration of solidarity 
even after it was suppressed in the december 1981 martial law 
crackdown and outlawed in october 1982 it survived first mainly 
as an underground organization and more openly in recent years

call it the lost summer call it the biggest 
beach scare since jaws hit town just call it over and lets get 
on with it said new yorks top parks official 
the fact that the summer of 1988 has ended is the only good 
thing many can say after northeast beaches were sullied by medical 
waste and sewage 
you can write off the summer of 88 said city parks 
commissioner henry stern it turned out to be the year of the 
plague 
with one of the hottest summers in 119 years the temperature 
in manhattan passed the 90degree mark 32 times it should have 
been a banner year 
but the tide turned in june when the first wave of medical 
debris aids contaminated hypodermic needles appeared in bayonne 
nj and then long island and staten island and coney island and 
a string of beaches on the jersey shore 
medical waste also turned up on beaches in connecticut rhode 
island and massachusetts and at lake eries cleveland lakefront 
state park in ohio 
john j gaines president of the narragansett chamber of 
commerce in rhode island believes the state benefited from the 
mess when tourists from new york and connecticut headed north he 
said tourism was up as much as 24 percent 
connecticut also was plagued by hypodermic needles syringes and 
high coliform counts at the beach but the local economy did not 
suffer greatly a majority of the beaches are privately owned 
in new jersey and new york vacationers and day visitors stayed 
away by the hundreds of thousands and everyone from motel owners 
to local fishermen and parking lot attendants was hard hit 
it was like a great shark scare said stern people stayed 
away from the beaches waiting for the all clear signal and it 
never came 
more than 1000 pieces of medical debris were scooped up at city 
beaches from the bronx to staten island said stern 
an investigation failed to pinpoint the source of the problem a 
state report said it was probably caused by sewer runoff illegal 
dumping and a laundry list of other reasons 
the possibility is that we will never know said city 
sanitation department spokesman jim hart 
new jersey merchants estimate it will cost the 77 
billionayear shore industry more than 1 billion in lost revenue 
state officials said figures arent complete 
the long island tourism board estimated business was off at 
least 20 percent in brighton beach brooklyn a seashore community 
that depends on a hearty summer to survive business plummeted 40 
percent to 60 percent 
we were only closed for two days in july just two days 
said ben liederman of the brighton industrial development group 
but the scare alone 
the incidents were isolated but everyone seemed to pay the 
price they closed six beaches out of 480 four miles out of 
1600 miles of coastline said david j lee vice president of 
the long island tourism commission it was minuscule 
new jersey officials tried to counter the bad publicity by 
spending an extra 575000 in advertising to attract visitors said 
liz thomas deputy director of the department of travel and tourism 
some merchants plan aggressive advertising campaigns to lure 
beachgoers back while others will continue pushing elected 
officials to make sure the issue is not dropped once the headlines 
and the summer fade 
i didnt ever want to get involved said jeff konner owner 
of the sea spray motel in shipbottom nj but now ill take a 
day off and go up with a group to trenton 
this is my life here he said everything i own is 
invested in this place 
officials are considering laws aimed at tracking medical waste 
from its point of origin and requiring labels on all hospital and 
laboratory debris 
but said national park service spokesman manny strumpf even 
assuming the beaches are going to be clean next year its going 
to be one hell of a selling job to get the public back

republican vice presidential nominee dan quayle 
defended his campaign manager saturday saying he saw no reason for 
him to step aside just because he had once lobbied for the 
government of panamanian gen manuel antonio noriega 
at a news conference quayle gave his first detailed response to 
revelations that his campaign manager stuart spencer had done 
consulting work for the government run by noriega quayle said 
spencer a longtime gop strategist and reagan intimate was a 
political pro whose advice he needed 
i believe that his political experience and political guidance 
has been and will be valuable to me quayle said 
the new republic this week said that a public relations firm run 
by spencer was paid 350000 in 198586 to lobby for noriega 
panamas military strongman and reputed drug kingpin 
according to the article the firm lobbied against drug 
investigations of noriega and defended him against allegations of 
killing dr hugo spadafora one of noriegas most outspoken 
critics in september 1985 
quayle said he met spencer for the first time last month when he 
became george bushs running mate and spencer a veteran of both 
reagan presidential campaigns came to handle his campaign 
i did not know about this at the time quayle said 
referring to spencers lobbying for noriega 
however quayle noted that spencers consulting contract had 
expired several years ago and that spencer had advised panamas 
civilian president at the time eric arturo delvalle that panama 
should be run by a civilian rather than military government 
noriega ousted delvalle in february 
theyd be in a much better situation had they accepted his 
advice on that thats about all i know quayle said 
quayle reaffirmed his position that noriega has got to go 
the sooner the better when asked whether that statement also 
applied to spencer quayle replied no 
bush meeting with reporters outside his washington residence 
also defended spencer panamas a friendly country bush said 
and as he made clear i think delvalle was the president under 
which he was hired so i have no concerns about that and i think 
he explained it pretty well 
quayle was also asked to elaborate on his comment friday that 
the decision of democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis to 
rehire former top aide john sasso as his campaign vice chairman 
meant that dukakis campaign was in serious trouble 
sasso resigned in september 1987 after admitting that he 
circulated a videotape of sen joseph biden using a british 
politicians rhetoric without attribution 
i guess you would say that the liberal furlough policy of the 
governor of massachusetts is still in place quayle said a jibe 
at the states weekend prisonrelease program dukakis signed a 
bill cutting back the program after a murderer on a weekend 
furlough raped a maryland woman 
at an arts and crafts fair in newnan ga a reporter asked 
quayle if he was concerned that georgia voters might be swayed by 
sen sam nunn a democrat and dukakis supporter when it came to 
their presidential choice nunn is chairman of the senate armed 
services committee a committee on which quayle serves 
this is a prodefense state the prodefense presidential 
choice is is george bush not michael dukakis quayle said 
during his visit to the fair quayle was given a rocking chair 
and a sketch depicting a turkeycalling contest on the sketch in 
a reference to the news media was an inscription which read no 
matter how loud they gobble they are still turkeys 
quayle and his wife marilyn have said they feel reporters have 
been overzealous in pursuing various controversies about the 
senators military service academic record and personal life 
after the georgia appearances quayle traveled to columbia 
sc where he attended the university of south carolina football 
season opener against the university of north carolina

american businesses are mobilizing to take 
advantage of the new trade law while economists still fret that 
even in its watereddown form the measure could spark harmful 
retaliation against us exports 
the threeyear battle to get the landmark legislation through 
congress marks only the beginning of a bigger fight to make sure 
that the law is fully utilized supporters contend 
to that end lobbying organizations for both business and labor 
groups are briefing their members on the details of the 1000page 
bill which president reagan signed into law on aug 23 
the us chamber of commerce has prepared a detailed guide to 
acquaint business leaders with a law that chamber president richard 
lesher calls a turning point in us economic history in 
addition the chamber is preparing a videotape and will offer 
seminars both in the united states and abroad 
we have prepared a very extensive program to inform us and 
foreign businesses of the impact of this legislation on current 
operations and its implications for longrange planning lesher 
said 
the chamber and many other business groups opposed the trade 
bill as it was first passed objecting to a provision that would 
have required companies to give workers advanced notice of mass 
layoffs and plant closings 
reagan vetoed the original trade law primarily because of the 
plant closing section but reversed course later and allowed a 
separate bill with just the layoffs and plantclosing legislation 
to become law without his signature 
the chambers guide seeks to explain the complex trade law in 
laymens language and at the same time explode what the business 
group believes are myths about the legislation 
there has been an enormous amount of misunderstanding about 
what this trade bill is said william t archey the chambers 
top trade expert he blamed this on the fact that the legislation 
took three years to emerge from congress with much of the early 
attention focused on heavily protectionist provisions that were 
jettisoned from the final product 
i think those who would argue that it is protectionist should 
be required to read it first archey said 
but private economists still worry about provisions made less 
stringent in the final version of the bill that will make it 
easier for the united states to impose import curbs in retaliation 
for alleged unfair trading practices by other nations they contend 
that this could prompt other countries to retaliate by raising 
barriers against us products 
earlier drafts of the measure contained langauge that would have 
given the president no discretion in retaliating against unfair 
trade practices by countries running large surpluses with the 
united states such as japan 
private economists note that foreign reaction to the greater 
possibility of import curbs has been overwhelmingly negative from 
both the far east and europe 
we have made a lot of people overseas mad and there is always 
the risk that they will react negatively to the pressure we are 
applying to get them to open up their markets said david wyss 
of data resources inc a lexington mass economic forecasting 
firm 
since the legislation gives the president a large amount of 
leeway in deciding whether to retaliate both presidential 
candidates are being watched carefully for clues on how they would 
handle the new law 
the law by itself is not going to solve the trade problem but 
it provides the tools to an executive who wants to address the 
problem forcefully said mark anderson an economist with the 
aflcio 
anderson said that vice president george bush would likely 
continue the freetrade emphasis of the reagan years while 
democratic nominee michael dukakis has pledged a more forceful 
attack on the countrys huge trade deficits the aflcio has 
endorsed dukakis 
other economists agreed that dukakis would be more activist on 
trade matters than bush but they said that even a democratic 
administration would not utilize the full powers of the legislation 
for fear of retaliation 
both of these candidates are basically internationalists 
dukakis would be tougher than bush but i dont think the risk of a 
trade war is that great because i dont think dukakis is going to 
push the bill to its limit wyss said 
the first sign of the new administrations intention is likely 
to come next april when the legislation requires the us trade 
representative an appointee of the president to produce a list of 
targeted countries along with a plan for negotiations aimed at 
removing trade barriers 
countries with large surpluses such as japan west germany and 
korea are likely candidates to be on the list 
long before then however the trade law should have a positive 
impact on exports of such hightechnology equipment as computers 
the law substantially reduces licensing requirements for these 
exports 
while the original rules were designed to prevent 
defenserelated equipment from falling into the hands of the soviet 
union or its allies supporters of the change contended that 
american businesses were losing 93 billion annually in sales 
because of unnecessary licensing requirements the change is 
expected to eliminate the need for more than 25000 export licenses 
a year on products deemed to be of little use militarily

federal authorities arrested a political 
foe of prime minister rajiv gandhi on saturday and accused him of

victim of a political vendetta he also was defended by the wife of 
the badminton star 
singh 32 was arrested in lucknow the capital of uttar pradesh 
state in connection with the july 28 slaying of syed modi indias 
topranked badminton player said an official of the central bureau 
of investigation 
authorities have evidence that singh had an affair with modis 
wife ameeta and conspired with her to murder the sportsman said 
the official the official based in new delhi cannot be

soon after the arrest mrs modi 24 said the killer was still 
free i cannot believe sanjay singh could murder my husband 
she told the united news of india news agency in lucknow he was 
modis closest friend 
the arrest also drew criticism from jan morcha or peoples 
movement an opposition group to which singh belongs i am not 
surprised at the arrest said arun nehru a party leader and 
gandhis cousin it is the natural culmination of a motivated 
investigation 
jan morcha broke away from gandhis governing congress party and 
is highly critical of the prime minister singh is not a 
politically powerful outside uttar pradesh but he commands 
considerable influence in amethi the prime ministers 
parliamentary constituency 
singh was a close ally of gandhi and his campaign manager during 
the last elections to parliament in 1985 singh is the scion of the 
former royal family of amethi and although titles were abolished 
in india in 1971 former maharajahs and princes still have a large 
following 
singh fell out with gandhi last year after differences with the 
uttar pradesh chief minister when gandhi sided with the chief 
minister the highest elected official in the state singh quit the 
congress party he has vowed not to let gandhi win any further 
elections from amethi 
modi 28 was shot with a colt 38caliber revolver as he 
stepped out of a lucknow sports stadium where had gone for his 
customary evening round of practise the uttar pradesh government 
asked the central bureau of investigation patterned on the fbi to 
take over the case on aug 2 
on aug 16 bureau detectives arrested four people including an 
associate of singh on murder charges ameeta modi was later 
arrested on charges of conspiring in the murder after unidentified 
sources in the bureau told newspapers they had evidence that she 
had an affair with singh 
mrs modi was released on bail when she said she had no one to 
care for her 6monthold daughter in india people arrested on 
murder charges usually are not released on bail 
singh was questioned several times by investigators in recent 
weeks on a visit to new delhi last week he told reporters this 
is the worst kind of political vendetta the prime minister and his 
coterie are using government agencies to intimidate the opposition 
their plan is to discredit me in order to give rajiv gandhi a 
victory in the next general elections 
his lucknow residence was also searched by detectives of the 
bureau and the search drew sharp criticism after it was televised 
on stateowned national television 
they want to try sanjay singh through electronic media said 
arif mohammed khan also a jan morcha leader they want to finish

a woman walks aimlessly through 
the information center at ramstein us air force base calling out 
hans the name of her missing husband 
in a hospital in nearby kaiserslautern the mother of a young 
child screams and faints when she realizes the boys face has been 
burned away 
at an emergency burn center near mannheim a mother weeps 
quietly and says it would be better if our daughter does not 
survive 
these are scenes from the aftermath of the ramstein air show a 
week ago when three italian jets collided during a stunt and one 
crashed into a huge crowd of spectators and exploded 
fiftyone people died 15 remain unaccounted for and more than 
160 are hospitalized 
within an hour after sundays crash volunteers set up a 
casualty information center in the base theater to help locate the 
missing 
people were crying and in a panic recalled airman stoney 
glover a volunteer who was working at the center shortly after the 
disaster 
they were shaking and looking desperately to find their 
relatives glover said a few hours after the crash one woman 
just wandered through the hall in a daze calling out the name of a 
missing relative he said 
about 300000 people attended the show and watched in horror as 
three italian jets collided during a highspeed stunt sending one 
flaming aircraft plunging into the crowd 
hundreds of spectators rushed to the information center 
immediately after the crash glover said 
by then the area at the crash site had been sealed off 
glover said they had no where else to turn to 
glover of orlando fla said after word of the accident 
spread the center was flooded with calls from worried relatives in 
the united states 
people were calling in hysterics trying to find out the 
whereabouts of sons or daughters stationed here glover said 
as volunteers at the center worked frantically to reunite 
families and friends relatives of the severely injured faced grim 
emergency ward scenes 
relatives who arrived after the accident were confronted with 
sights that no one can prepare for said werner overbeck head of 
surgery at kaiserslautern city hospital where 98 victims were 
treated 
many patients had suffered burns that made them unrecognizable 
to their families overbeck said 
it was pandemonium here the day after the crash said an 
emergency room receptionist i saw a woman scream and faint when 
they brought her son in on a gurney his face was gone 
one young mother after visiting her daughter at the burn unit 
in a hospital near mannheim said it is difficult for parents to 
say but it would be better if our daughter does not survive 
the woman told the frankfurt abendpost newspaper that the child 
had suffered burns over 70 percent of her body including her face 
it was not known if the girl survived 
two americans were among the dead most of the dead and hundreds 
who were injured at the air show were west germans 
alfred witt of trier found out friday his 16yearold son mario 
was dead after discovering the boys housekey among long rows of 
items found on the bodies of victims who had been so mutilated they 
could not be identified the bild newspaper reported 
they wouldnt let us see the dead the father said 
days after the accident some families were still waiting for 
word about missing relatives 
every time the phone rings our emotions sweep from hope to 
despair the abendpost quoted gerd wagner of nuremberg as saying 
twelveyearold andreas wagner had left the rest of the family 
to get a closer look at the aerobatic display his father said 
i thought to myself nothing can happen to him wagner 
said 
in the turmoil after the accident many injured family members 
were sent to different hospitals 
we are treating the parents of a seriously injured girl here 
in kaiserslautern overbeck said the little girl is fighting 
for her life in a hospital near ludwigshafen 
overbeck and other specialists said many of the most severely 
burned probably will die of complications over the weeks to come 
while grief for lost loved ones is enormous overbeck said 
relatives of the maimed and the victims themselves will face unique 
psychological burdens long after they leave the hospital 
these people must now deal with the pain of disfigurement and 
loss of function for months and years to come overbeck said 
jeffrey nelson a psychiatrist stationed at ramstein said 
attendance at a special grief clinic on base soared after the 
accident 
what we are seeing is a classic disaster response nelson 
said at first people were too stunned to talk now they are 
moving through other stages of guilt anger depression and 
anxiety 
anyone who has gone through such an experience has their sense 
of lifes predictability and security taken away nelson said 
he said the sessions are open to americans and west germans and 
are being expanded to include all personnel at the base

the presidential candidates wound up their prelabor day 
campaigns saturday with democrat michael dukakis paying a 
sentimental visit to ellis island and republican george bush 
pointedly praising his opponents debating skills 
hes probably a better debater bush said of the 
massachusetts governor adding quickly im lowering 
expectations 
in an outdoor news conference followed by a picnic for reporters 
at his vice presidential residence on the grounds of the us naval 
observatory in washington bush refrained from the fiery attacks 
that dominated his campaign speeches last week 
however dukakis started his day by attacking bushs 
insensitivity to the plight of the unemployed 
bush on friday called an increase in the jobless rate from 54 
percent in july to 56 percent in august statistically almost 
irrelevant 
dukakis seized on that saturday telling supporters outside his 
hotel in sioux falls sd that the increase meant another 
200000 people without jobs 
he continued his criticism of bushs remark later adding it to 
a speech at ellis island in new york 
we must never forget although some already have that no 
one in america is irrelevant dukakis said in america everyone 
matters we stand by our neighbors 
dukakis trip to ellis island was a sentimental and symbolic 
journey on which he was accompanied by his 85yearold mother 
euterpe an immigrant from greece she landed there 76 years ago on 
her arrival in the united states 
americas story is the immigrants story dukakis said 
newcomers arriving some on slave ships to our lasting shame 
some on converted coal ships like my mother immigrants from every 
corner of earth drawn by the torch of freedom 
dukakis also was accompanied by new york gov mario cuomo 
himself the son italian immigrants who hailed the democratic 
nominee for standing on the edge of realizing the immigrant 
fantasy he is about to become the president of the united states 
of america 
cuomo was among some dozen political leaders who were expected 
to be named this week as cochairmen of the dukakis campaign 
others included sen john glenn of ohio sen sam nunn of georgia 
and gov madelyn kunin of vermont according to a campaign source 
who demanded anonymity 
politically the trip to the island was a reminder of dukakis 
ethnic roots as the democrats try to win back the ethnic voters who 
cast republican ballots for ronald reagan in 1980 and 1984 
bush meanwhile said a twoday break in campaigning this 
weekend is a good time to take stock of where things stand 
he said he was not concerned about questions arising over stuart 
spencer campaign manager for vice presidential running mate dan 
quayle spencers lobbying firm was paid more than 350000 in l985 
and 1986 to assist the panamanian government headed by gen manuel 
antonio noriega 
quayle campaigning in atlanta also defended spencer 
i believe that his political experience and political guidance 
has been and will be valuable to me quayle said 
on the presidential debates bush said he had no intention of 
changing his stand on the number of facetoface encounters between 
the candidates bush has agreed to two televised debates while 
dukakis wants three 
weve made a strong proposal that calls for two debates at 
this level and one at the vice presidential level and were going 
to stay with it bush said i think its the right amount of 
this kind of campaign activity 
hes favored in the debates theres no doubt about it bush 
said of dukakis my wife barbara when i practice debating she 
falls asleep and ive got to do something different about that 
in debates as elsewhere in politics a candidates performance 
is measured by how well he was expected to do bush clearly was 
trying to lower the expectations for his performance while raising 
the stakes for dukakis

michael dukakis in a visit with 
strong personal and political overtones was touring ellis island 
saturday with his immigrant mother euterpe and he declared we 
are one nation one people one community 
one day short of her 85th birthday mrs dukakis was living the 
ultimate american dream visiting the island where she landed more 
than 75 years ago as a 9yearold greek immigrant with a son who 
was the democratic candidate for president of her adopted land 
panos dukakis who would later meet and marry euterpe passed 
through ellis island a year before her 
their story is your story it is our story it is the story of 
america michael dukakis said to a gathering of firstgeneration 
americans 
among those joining them for the occasion was new york gov 
mario cuomo the son of italian immigrants 
cuomo introduced dukakis as someone who stands on the edge of 
realizing the immigrant fantasy he is about to become the 
president of the united states of america 
cuomo is among as many as a dozen political leaders expected to 
be named this week as cochairmen of the dukakis campaign others 
included sen john glenn of ohio sen sam nunn of georgia and gov 
madelyn kunin of vermont according to a campaign source who 
demanded anonymity 
dukakis visit to the island had more than personal 
significance it also was designed to strengthen his identification 
with ethnic voters in the presidential election 
many voters who retained strong identification with their ethnic 
roots traditionally supported democratic presidential candidates in 
the past but large numbers shifted their allegiance to ronald 
reagan in the 1980 and 1984 elections 
now dukakis is trying to win them back to the democrats 
americas story is the immigrants story he said 
newcomers arriving some on slave ships to our lasting shame 
some on converted coal ships like my mother immigrants from every 
corner of earth drawn by the torch of freedom 
the massachusetts governor said we must never forget that we 
like those who built our nation must have our minds on the 
future 
he said the choice between him and republican george bush in the 
presidential election was between accepting the world as it is 
and accepting our responsibility to make it better 
we must never forget though some would have us do so that 
the dream belongs not just to the privileged few but to all of 
us he said 
we must never forget though some would have us do so that 
today the rich are getting richer the poor are getting poorer and 
those in the middle must work twice as hard just to stay in place 
we must never forget though some would have us do so that 
we have a responsibility not to be satisfied not to be complacent 
not to be weary not to rest until all our citizens are full 
shareholders in our shared dream 
dukakis said that when he looks at the american flag i see a 
quarter of a billion faces of all ages all colors all shapes and 
all sizes i see a nation dedicated to a belief in individual 
rights strengthened by a commitment to family values united by an 
understanding that for all our diversity we are one nation one 
people one community 
dukakis spoke from a podium facing the large brick building his 
mother passed through when she arrived in america 
when he finished speaking dukakis turned around and walked to 
his mother who was seated behind him and kissed her 
the ellis island stop was the end of a threeday prelabor day 
campaign trip to california oregon washington and south dakota 
at an early morning rally in sioux falls sd dukakis chided 
bush for calling an increase in the unemployment rate 
irrelevant 
the labor dempartment announced on friday that the jobless rate 
for august was 56 percent up from 54 percent in july 
bush called the increase statistically almost irrelevant 
another 200000 people without jobs said dukakis the 
vice president said it was irrelevant those are people those are 
our fellow citizens its not irrelevant 
dukakis inserted into his ellis island speech another reference 
to the unemployment figures saying we must never forget 
although some already have that no one in america is irrelevant 
in america everyone matters we stand by our neighbors 
its so troubling to have a high ranking official of our 
government say that these folks are statistically irrelevant

rival palestinian factions with mortars 
and rocketpropelled grenades clashed in a south beirut refugee 
camp saturday killing three people and wounding nine police said 
in another development the most senior shiite moslem cleric in 
lebanon blamed the united states and israel for parliaments 
failure to elect a new president and said it will explode in 
their face 
guerrillas of george habashs marxist popular front for the 
liberation of palestine fought syrianbacked fighters of col saeed 
mousas fatahuprising for five hours 
a police spokesman said the clash at the bourj elbarajneh 
refugee camp stopped after neutral guerrilla groups called a 
ceasefire 
police patrols couldnt enter the camp to launch an 
investigation said the spokesman who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
he said the casualties were evacuated to hospitals in west 
beirut 
the popular front for the liberation of palestine operates under 
the umbrella of yasser arafats palestine liberation organization 
mousa broke away from the plo in 1983 and established 
headquarters in damascus the syrian capital 
guerrillas of arafats mainline fatah group evacuated bourj 
elbarajneh their last foothold in beirut on july 8 after the 
camp fell to mousas followers 
the shiite leader sheik mohammed mehdi shamseddin said said an 
americanisraeli plot was behind parliaments failure on aug 
18 to muster a quorum of 51 members to elect a new president 
if the americans want to continue with their dangerous game 
then a force stronger than what they have known will explode in 
their face he said 
the only serious candidate was syrianbacked warlord suleiman 
franjieh 78 according to lebanons constitution a new head of 
state should be elected before sept 23 when the sixyear term of 
president amin gemayel expires 
parliament speaker hussein husseini a shiite adjourned the 
abortive election session without setting a date for a new meeting 
to elect a president 
syrianbacked leftist and moslem factions have accused the 
united states and the rightwing christian lebanese forces militia 
which is sympathatic to israel of blocking franjiehs election 
franjiehs backers have also accused the lebanese forces of 
forcefully preventing deputies from attending the parliamentary 
session to block the election of franjieh a personal friend of 
syrian president hafez assad 
the christian militia has denied the charge and said the 
boycotters opposed franjiehs election but a lebanese forces 
spokesman speaking privately said parliament will have no 
quorum as long as franjieh remains a candidate 
us state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley has blamed 
parliaments failure to elect a new president on the lack of a 
consensus candidate 
shamseddin addressing a news conference at his residence in 
moslem west beirut said the united states wants to end syrias 
regional middle eastern role to give israel a free hand in 
lebanon 
we are determined not to succumb to the american stand said 
shamseddin who heads the supreme shiite islamic council in lebanon 
syria the main power broker in lebanon maintains 40000 troops

staff sgt steven rifkin 
was looking forward to a little rampr after a blistering 60mile 
march at the armys fort lewis near seattle 
but his feet are hot again for a week he has tramped through 
yellowstones scorched forests learning a brand of warfare that 12 
years in the army did not prepare him for learning for example 
to watch your feet 
in some burns youll be standing there and your feet start 
cooking rifkin said friday as he stood guard by a park road 
watching for flying embers 
rifkin is one of 2400 fort lewis soldiers who have joined the 
fight against what officials say is the wests worst summer of 
forest fires in at least 23 years 
fires raging out of control in nine states have stretched 
regular firefighting crews so thin that officials are depending on 
unprecedented numbers of novice firefighters from the military and 
from civilian unemployment lines 
most of these socalled casual firefighters like rifkin 
have never fought a fire before and theyre being sent into the 
woods with as little as five hours of training but fire officials 
say the newcomers have become an indispensable part of firefighting 
teams this summer 
nearly 36 million acres have burned this summer in western 
states and alaska said mike ferris a spokesman at the federal 
boise interagency fire center in idaho 
thats the most since the center was created in 1965 and its 
nearly three times the area burned last year at this time he said 
some fires are expected to continue burning well into october 
about 25500 firefighters and support personnel are battling the 
farflung fires ferris said 
normally crews are shuttled from one state to another as blazes 
flare up but local firefighting officials in many states are 
keeping crews close to home this summer worried that more fires 
will break out in the persistent drought 
as a result officials have had to scramble for extra manpower 
in areas such as yellowstone where six major blazes have charred 
more than a halfmillion acres of the 22 millionacre park 
the army started sending soldiers to the fires of montana and 
wyoming about two weeks ago 
last week the forest service started hiring inexperienced 
firefighters through local job service offices throughout the west 
about 1340 of those casual firefighters hit the forests this 
weekend ferris said 
the employment agencies were swamped with applicants many of 
whom were weeded out because they failed physical exams and aerobic 
fitness tests 
it is the first time that fort lewis soldiers have been called 
on to fight forest fires said lt bob brewer an army spokesman in 
yellowstone 
theyre doing a lot of good productive work together said 
sandie hand a national park service spokeswoman 
the soldiers received five to 10 hours of training in fire 
behavior use of tools and safety brewer said 
additional training had to wait for the field before being 
allowed near active fires the first wave of army firefighters 
spent a week working cold lines hacking fire breaks through 
the woods far from flames 
but in recent days as the fires spread and the soldiers gain 
respect for their abilities the apprenticeship time has shrunk 
brewer said new recruits may spend only two days on the cold 
lines he said 
the soldiers safety record has been excellent no firerelated 
injuries had been reported by friday in yellowstone brewer said 
the hefty meals served at the forest service fire camps appeal 
to soldiers accustomed to more pedestrian army fare on friday 
pvt 2nd class terry harp was still savoring the tbone steak 
served up two nights before 
i think this is the best ive eaten since ive been in the 
army he said

catching grapes is no picnic insists tavilla a produce 
merchant from arlington

armed soldiers lined narrow 
roads in this remote village saturday as thousands of mourners 
followed the funeral cortege of an ira guerrilla one of three men 
killed in an ambush by british soldiers 
a protestant leader bitterly protested the presence at the 
funeral of the dead mans brother another ira guerrilla who was 
released from prison to attend the service 
across the province in londonderry family and friends gathered 
to mourn a man and a woman who went to check on a neighbor but 
instead stumbled into an explosive booby trap laid for british 
soldiers 
the irish republican army apologized for the bombing deaths of 
sean dalton 55 and sheila lewis 60 but the clergyman who gave 
their eulogies had a bitter reply 
we do not want to hear any more apologies from the ira or from 
anyone else edward daly the catholic bishop of londonderry 
told the mourners 
we want an end to all this death and destruction which is 
destroying our city and destroying our people and destroying the 
chances for the young people coming along for work for 
opportunity daly said 
dalton broke into the neighbors apartment on wednesday and 
triggered a bomb rigged by the ira which had kidnapped the 
occupant and planned to blow up any army squad that came to check 
on the missing man the ira apologized saying the operation went 
tragically wrong 
as the families of the dead mourned in the two towns a british 
military base in crossmaglen near the south armagh border came 
under mortar attack police said two of the three shells that 
exploded landed inside the heavily fortified base but that there 
were no injuries and little damage 
in dunmoyle police and soldiers stood guard as mourners 
followed the cortege of 26yearold brian mullin one of three ira 
men shot to death tuesday by the waiting army as the guerrillas 
drove along a country road on what the ira called active duty 
news reports said mullin and brothers gerard harte 29 and 
martin harte 21 were about to try to kill an offduty member of 
the protestant ulster defense regiment when soldiers lying in wait 
riddled their stolen car with bullets 
the harte brothers were buried friday 
among the mourners at dunmoyle was mullins elder brother 
patrick released on a days compassionate leave from belfasts 
maze prison where he is serving a life sentence for the 1977 ira 
murder of a school bus driver another mistaken killing for which 
the ira apologized 
ken maginnis a member of the protestant official unionist 
party expressed outrage over the release 
it is an absolute scandal that this man who is one of a 
committed ira family should be released or paroled or whatever it 
is called maginnis said 
the concession for the funeral of a terrorist involved in the 
murder of eight young soldiers exactly 14 days ago is a concession 
to ira terrorism quite beyond comprehension 
maginnis is among those who believe brian mullin was involved in 
the bus bombing that killed eight british soldiers aug 20 and 
injured 27 others the worst incident so far of the iras 
heatedup campaign to drive the british out of the predominantly 
protestant province and unite it with the roman catholic irish 
republic 
patrick mullin was delayed at a security checkpoint and the 
cortege of about 2000 mourners did not leave the family farm at 
sixmilecross 50 miles west of belfast until about noon an hour 
later than scheduled 
more than 200 police and soldiers accompanied the hearse 
carrying mullins coffin which was draped with the irish tricolor 
flag along four miles of winding country roads from sixmilecross 
to dunmoyle for the funeral and burial

moscow authorities opened a suicide prevention 
center and set up a telephone hotline for troubled teenagers after 
a surge in suicides among young people including a 7yearold the 
government newspaper said saturday 
izvestia drew a link between a rise in suicides and increased 
alcohol and drug abuse 
among teenagers the abuse of alcohol and cigarettes drug 
and toxic substances is spreading the newspaper said it 
said specialists regarded the growing abuse as proof of conscious 
or unconscious striving toward physical and moral 
selfdestruction 
in one case a 7yearold killed himself the newspaper said 
the moscow center which opened sept 1 will be staffed by 
medical personnel skilled at easing stress and depression izvestia 
said it said specialists believe the hotline or telephone of 
trust is the most effective means of offering psychological 
counseling 
moscow has more than 20 psychological aid centers where people 
can seek help anonymously it also has had a telephone of trust 
for 15 years 
but now teenagers will have a hotline of their own that they 
can call if they want counseling 
izvestia did not give the number of the teenagers hotline or 
say how capital residents could get it it said the teenage 
suicide rate for moscow was closed information 
in june the weekly newspaper arguments and facts reported that 
the national suicide rate for people of all ages was about 20 per 
100000 members of the population that would be about 56000 
suicides a year 
according to a 1985 un report the suicide rate in the united 
states in 1982 was 122 per 100000 residents 
the more recent candor about the suicide problem in the soviet 
union is a consequence of soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs 
endorsement of glasnost or greater openness in the discussion 
of selected social issues

pakistan on saturday rejected an 
afghan proposal for another international conference to discuss the 
unbacked agreement calling for the withdrawal of soviet troops 
from afghanistan 
afghanistan suggested another conference of representatives from 
pakistan afghanistan the united states and the soviet union to 
follow the pact signed april 14 in geneva with the united states 
and soviets serving as guarantors 
a key provision of the geneva pact was the withdrawal of about 
115000 soviet military personnel from aghanistan the soviets sent 
troops into the neighboring country in december 1979 to help the 
marxist government battle anticommunist rebels 
western diplomats in islamabad said it appeared the afghan 
government wants a followup conference because of increased rebel 
attacks on the withdrawing soviet troops and afghan security 
forces the kremlin has said half of the soviets had been pulled 
out by the stipulated date of may 15 and all will be out of 
afghanistan by feb 15 
pakistans foreign affairs ministry issued a statement saturday 
rejecting the afghan proposal for a second conference it said it 
should be noted that the geneva agreements contain provisions with 
respect to implementation of the accords 
the statement said the pact and an accompanying memorandum of 
understanding provide procedures to consider alleged violations 
and to work out prompt and mutually satisfactory solutions to 
questions that may arise in the implementation of the instruments 
abdul wakil the afghan foreign minister suggested a new 
conference in a letter last week to un secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cueller 
both afghanistan and pakistan accuse each other of violating the 
april agreement 
afghanistan and the soviet union claim pakistan and the united 
states continue to provide support to the rebels in volation of the 
accord pakistan and the united states accuse the soviet and afghan 
forces of terrorist activities and bombings in pakistan washington 
on friday protested the bombing of kunduz in northern afghanistan 
by soviet aircraft 
a un mission established under the geneva agreement is 
operating in afghanistan and pakistan and both countries have filed 
complaints with the mission 
the pakistani foreign ministry statement said that is the proper 
procedure for complaining about violations 
it said afghanistans request for another conference on 
implementation of the accords appears to be no more than a 
propaganda measure designed to acquire international recognition 
and legitimacy 
the statement said that on sept 1 soon after afghanistan 
proposed the conference five afghan aircraft violated pakistani 
airspace and bombed two villages killing a number of civilians

biologists were thrilled to find a 
species of bat that some feared had slipped into extinction then 
they were ecstatic to learn the tiny florida mastiff bat was 
pregnant 
this means theres not just one but three mom dad and 
baby wildlife biologist frank mazzotti said after an xray 
examination disclosed the pregnancy 
no florida mastiff bat found only in southeastern florida had 
been identified since 1978 
the 5inch flying mammal bat turned up early last week on the 
balcony of a coral gables office and was handed over to specialists 
bat specialist mark robson of the state game and fresh water 
fish commission was thrilled to see the animal but alarmed that it 
appeared so sick 
it didnt try to fly or bite we speculated that it ran into 
the building the night before and sort of got stunned and when it 
lay there all day it got worse robson said 
its blood sugar and body temperature were dangerously low and 
the bat was pronounced in critical condition

half the jurors in the first tobacco 
liability suit to result in a judgment against a cigarette company 
for a lung cancer death say they were wrong in awarding money 
according to a report saturday 
they hope an appeals court overturns their verdict according to 
early sunday editions of the philadelphia inquirer 
three of the six federal jurors said in separate interviews over 
the last two weeks that they shouldnt have ordered the liggett 
group inc to award 400000 to antonio cipollone whose wife 
rose died of lung cancer after smoking for more than 40 years 
the trial judge h lee sarokin affirmed the verdict two weeks 
ago 
the jurors said they believed rose cipollone was responsible for 
her own actions that the tobacco commpanies never forced her to 
light up and that they never should have been held liable 
but they said they compromised after two of the jurors who 
insisted on finding the tobacco companies liable wore down the 
others through five days of intense deliberation and heated 
arguments in a cramped jury room in newark nj 
as i look back on it today i dont think i did the right 
thing said marie mickens who was the jury forewoman i hope 
they liggett win on appeal i really do 
ms mickens and the others who were interviewed by the newspaper 
said they wish they had simply told the judge they could not reach 
a conclusion that they were a hung jury and that the case 
should be retried 
when their verdict was read in court on june 13 juror barbara 
reilly wept 
i was crying because i gave in she said she said she 
believed the decision was wrong and that she should have stood her 
ground in the jury room 
another juror ralph eliseo said he also thought he should not 
have compromised and that the verdict should be overturned 
there are nights i lay awake wondering did i do something 
wrong thats going to affect mankind for years said eliseo the 
lone smoker on the jury 
the other three jurors declined to discuss the case the 
inquirer reported 
cipollones attorneys had argued that liggett which makes 
chesterfields the brand mrs cipollone smoked most of her life 
made false health claims in its 1950s advertising that advertising 
was essentially a false warranty that smoking was safe the lawyers 
claimed 
but the heart of their case the lawyers said was their claim 
that liggett conspired with philip morris inc and lorillard inc 
which made other brands of cigarettes mrs cipollone smoked to 
keep secret what the companies knew about the health hazards of 
smoking 
the plaintiffs attorneys introduced hundreds of secret industry 
documents from the 1950s it was the first time those documents had 
been used in a tobaccco liability trial and cipollones attorneys 
argued they illustrated a decision by cigarette makers to hide what 
they knew about the dangers of smoking 
the jury ms mickens said wasnt impressed by the documents 
its just how you interpret it she said we didnt see 
how they were so damaging 
attorneys for both cipollone and liggett said friday they were 
not surprised that the jurors had compromised but that their 
statements would have little or no part in the appeal that the 
cigarette company plans to file later this month 
what the jurors with their comments seem to indicate is that 
they accept the proposition that a person who smokes in the 40s 
50s or 60s understands what theyre doing and voluntarily chooses 
to smoke said james kearney an attorney for liggett

have been restored and are a state historic site the slave 
quarters gradually disappeared as the plantation fell into 
disrepair after the civil war

mindblowing said judy smith 33 the greatgreatgranddaughter 
of slaves joe and ellen collins 
ms smith of nearby plymouth said she was glad her mother 
persuaded her to attend ive met family i never knew i had its 
a great feeling to know i belong she said

resident whose decadelong quest for her roots led to records that 
told the story of the collins plantation and the slaves who built 
it 
at her invitation 2000 descendants of the original 21 slave 
families attended the emotional first reunion two years ago 
mrs redford is now employed by the state to do research and 
coordinate black history projects at the plantation site a book 
she wrote about her search for her family history goes on sale this 
month

a 16yearold boy who friends called 
little rambo told police he just wanted to get away from 
everything and kill somebody when he drove to a neighboring state 
and shot to death a woman he didnt know authorities said 
chris swatzell described by friends as a wellbehaved boy with 
an interest in military lore was in custody saturday in a 
nashville tenn mental health center for tests to see if he is 
competent to stand trial 
he faces capital murder charges in the killing of carolyn 
kilpatrick 41 who was found dead monday in a shop behind her home 
near linden tenn 
police said the boy who had never been in trouble with the law 
turned himself in and confessed to killing mrs kilpatrick 41 she 
was shot four times with a highpowered rifle 
to look at him you would just picture him as an allaround 
allamerican boy said betty kelso manager of a hardees 
restaurant where swatzell worked as a cook 
he wasnt a 16yearold who was out to conquer the world 
something must have happened 
perry county tenn sheriff thomas ward said the killing 
occurred about 2 pm monday about five hours after swatzell left 
unexcused from caldwell county high school in princeton 
ward said the teenager went home got two of his stepfathers 
highpowered militarytype rifles and drove southward into 
tennessee 
recounting swatzells confession ward said the boy passed mrs 
kilpatricks home six miles west of linden tenn which is about 
120 miles from princeton 
mrs kilpatrick was working in a furniture refinishing shop 
behind her house ward said swatzell drove into the driveway 
walked to the doorway of the shop and shot her four times with a 
semiautomatic ar15 similar to a deer rifle 
he said he just wanted to get away from everything and kill 
somebody ward said he said he had been wanting to do it for 
about three months 
swatzell hitched a ride to parsons tenn where he turned 
himself in about the time mrs kilpatricks husband found his 
wifes body 
police found the ar15 rifle and a second similar rifle in the 
boys abandoned car and found a bayonet and guncleaning kit in 
his militarystyle knapsack 
ward said swatzells stepfather david braden a kentucky prison 
officer collected militarytype guns and swatzell often went to a 
firing range near princeton 
the sheriff said the boys friends nicknamed him little 
rambo and gi joe because of his interest in military gear 
but the boys behavior did not suggest he was a fanatic about such 
things 
his mother told us he liked rambo but he wasnt obsessed with 
that sort of thing ward said he seems to be a very average 
boy never in any trouble its strange 
brenda stephens caldwell county high schools guidance 
counselor said swatzell used to often wear fatigues but so did 
many other students his age 
lately he wasnt projecting that image she said he wore 
blue jeans and tshirts 
ms stephens said she didnt meet often with swatzell because 
his grades were average to good and he had no disciplinary problems 
he wasnt a joiner she said he had a very close circle 
of friends and just minded his own business

solidarity leader lech walesa risked his 
reputation with supporters by halting a series of strikes in 
exchange for a vague government promise to discuss legalizing his 
banned union movement and allowing union pluralism 
but the stakes in the upcoming talks also are high for the 
government after strikes this spring and summer poland appears 
doomed to recurring episodes of costly labor unrest unless the 
government can find a way to build social confidence or at least 
patience for austerity measures to fix the ailing economy 
church mediator jacek ambroziak said saturday the roundtable 
talks on broad social and political issues could begin very soon 
after a preliminary meeting with authorities wednesday walesa won 
a promise that solidarity would be on the agenda 
but many prosolidarity workers distrustful of government 
promises feared walesa agreed too easily to end the strikes 
without a firm agreement from authorities to legalize solidarity or 
at least some form of independent unions 
solidarity the only independent union federation in the soviet 
bloc was crushed with martial law in 1981 and banned the following 
year 
walesa was unsmiling when asked about opposition among workers 
to ending the strikes the question was put shortly after a tense 
latenight meeting wednesday with strikers in gdansk 
i have always trusted my instincts he said emphatically 
and my instincts tell me i am right 
walesa spent the next two days going to shipyards and ports in 
gdansk and to a coal mine in silesia to persuade strikers to return 
to work and he delivered the same message by phone to the szczecin 
port and the stalowa wola steel mill 
in the end he bent all the strikers to his will but workers 
who considered the strikes the best way to pressure the government 
appeared likely to hold walesa responsible if the talks failed to 
produce concrete results 
although the government could easily undercut walesa by 
torpedoing the talks the solidarity leader may be calculating that 
the government has just as much to lose as him if they fail 
as a political scientist who advises polish leader gen wojciech 
jaruzelski suggested in a prominently published interview friday 
the meeting could be key for marshaling support for hard economic 
choices 
it is easy to stir strikes said antoni rajkiewicz but very 
difficult to persuade people to do things demanding patience 
endurance and thrift 
he said the government needs through the talks not only to reach 
a working consensus with the roman catholic church and solidarity 
activists but also to stimulate the imagination and mobilize the 
mass of people now caught up in tides of hopelessness 
the extent of the hopelessness was revealed in a poll of high 
school students the poll released friday said 64 percent 
believed they lacked chances to realize their life goals in poland 
meanwhile there were growing signs in the press of a possible 
government shakeup to try to increase public support for the 
economic reform program which so far has led to strikes and 
inflation expected to top 60 percent this year 
the lack of confidence in the government is a political 
fact the influential communist party weekly polityka commented 
this week 
changes in the government will not deliver more money to our 
pockets or more goods to our shops it said however they will 
give radical reform a boost

iraqs foreign minister said saturday that the 
10dayold persian gulf peace talks were stalled at their starting 
point and he blamed iran for the delay 
foreign minister tariq aziz spoke to reporters at the un 
building in geneva after a nearly twohour meeting with un 
mediator jan eliasson 
we are still at square one aziz said we have not gone 
beyond that square because the other side the iranian side has 
not yet shown any substantive sign that they realize their 
commitments visavis the ceasefire 
he said those commitments had to do with freedom of navigation 
and with the shattalarab waterway iraqs main outlet to the sea 
iran has insisted it has the right to stop vessels in the gulf and 
share control of the waterway 
the dispute over the waterway is one of the key issues in the 
talks 
aziz also accused iran of using their traditional art of 
procrastination in the talks maybe they were betting that 
procrastination would make people fed up and then give up we 
dont 
he said iraqi delegates would stay at the talks as long as 
necessary 
iran made no immediate response to his comments 
iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati later held a nearly 
threehour meeting with eliasson that lasted until after midnight 
as velayati left he told reporters the talks were constructive 
irans foreign minister said we do hope that we can continue 
our talks during the next day or the day after tomorrow and added 
that we should see how things are going after the weekend he 
declined further comment 
earlier saturday eliasson told reporters he was working hard to 
find a format to advance the talks however an iranian delegate 
speaking on condition of anonymity said the problem was substance 
not form 
the talks are aimed at agreeing on followup measures to the 
unsponsored ceasefire that took effect aug 20 the iraniraq 
conflict which began in september 1980 has claimed about 1 
million lives 
eliasson said we are working hard and we hope that we will be 
advancing but he reported little movement 
he spoke shortly before meeting with aziz and other members of 
the iraqi delegation 
eliasson named special representative thursday by un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar met separately with both 
ministers friday perez de cuellar left geneva on thursday after 
mediating the first week of the talks 
perez de cuellar said before he left geneva that the main 
problem in the talks was that the two sides did not trust each 
other 
on friday the iranian mission in geneva released a list of 47 
alleged iraqi violations of the ceasefire on saturday the iraqi 
mission distributed a copy of an iraqi news agency report that also 
accused iran of committing 47 ceasefire violations 
iran has called for the immediate withdrawal of troops behind 
their respective borders it also calls for quick implementation of 
the provisions of the un security councils ceasefire 
resolution particularly establishment of an independent inquiry to 
establish which side started the war

a wayward freighter carrying toxic wastes can 
unload its unwanted cargo in britain if it is properly contained 
and documented environmental officials said saturday 
if what was on the karin b or any other waste is properly 
identified safely packaged got the approval of waste disposal 
authorities is properly documented and complies with our laws 
there will be no problem said an environmental department 
spokesman in london speaking anonymously in keeping with british 
custom 
in france meanwhile authorities said five sailors on the karin 
b have become ill but do not need immediate hospital treatment 
the ship with its leaking cargo was turned away from britain 
last week and now is anchored in international waters off frances 
normandy coast 
the italian government announced friday the ship would be 
allowed to unload its cargo in italy probably at an unspecified 
military port 
france britain spain west germany belgium and the 
netherlands all refused entry to the karin b carrying 2100 tons 
of toxic wastes originally shipped from italy and dumped illegally 
in nigeria 
a statement issued friday night by the maritime prefecture in 
cherbourg said a french navy doctor was taken by helicopter to 
examine the crew members aboard the ship 
the maritime prefecture statement said the five sailors 
complained of pain in the chest and abdomen while the rest of the 
10man crew including the captain reported no health problems 
it said there would be further examinations of the ailing crew 
members but did not make clear whether they would sail with the 
freighter to italy 
italian officials have said they do not know the precise content 
of the cargo which may have originated from as many as 10 european 
countries the load was dumped secretly in nigeria whose 
government insisted italy remove them and seized an italian ship 
the piave last july to enforce its demands

prime minister lee kuan yew led his peoples 
action party to its eighth straight election victory since 1959 
winning 80 seats in the recently enlarged 81member parliament 
there had been no doubt that the peoples action party would 
win when counting was completed sunday the party had won 69 of 
the 70 seats contested in saturdays balloting and 11 seats in 
which its candidates were unopposed 
lees party won 646 percent of final vote tally compared with 
648 percent in the previous election in 1984 
lee 64 has been prime minister since 1959 when singaore a 
former british colony became selfgoverning he is expected to 
step down within the coming months and be succeeded by first deputy 
prime minister goh chok tong 
i take great satisfaction from the results the transition 
is complete the future is up to my younger colleagues lee told 
a news conference 
lee was reelected easily in his constituency defeating lawyer 
mg guru who ran as an independent 14043 votes to 3167 
the last parliament had 79 seats pap held 76 two were vacant 
and chiam see tong leader of the singapore democratic party had 
the other 
candidates from seven opposition parties and four independents 
failed to win any seats 
seven constituencies were abolished recently and nine new ones 
created because of population shifts 
chiam who won the only seat saturday not claimed by the 
governing party immediately challenged lee to hold a referendum on 
lees proposal to replace the countrys largely ceremonial 
presidency 
the president now is selected by the prime minister and his 
cabinet under the lees pln the president would be elected and 
would have veto power over spending from the nations financial 
reserves and appointments to senior civil service and judicial 
positions 
the president would have access to all government departments 
but would not have full executive power 
lee said a president with veto powers could guard the nations 
financial reserves if future governments tried to use the money 
unwisely 
it has been suggested lee might run for the office in a 
presidential election and he was asked about that at his news 
conference 
the proposal has not been tailored for me he said ill 
campaign in support of it but i dont want the job 
another issue stressed by the pap is the planned creation of 
town councils in each parliamentary constituency to manage public 
housing about 86 percent of singapores 26 million people live in 
governmentbuilt apartments that are now administered by civil 
servants 
pap candidates told voters that inept legislators controlling 
the civil service could neglect rubbish collection elevator 
repairs and other routine but chores 
chaim said the towncouncil concept was part of the paps 
overall plan to reduce the role of parliament to pave the way for 
an executive president 
the internal security act which allows the government to detain 
suspects indefinately without charges had not been a major issue 
critics claim the measure was abused by the government to deal 
with people opposed lees policies 
the law was used to jail 22 alleged marxists last year and hold 
opposition lawyer francis seow for 72 days this year seow was 
accused of dealing with us diplomats to recruit lawyers to oppose 
pap parliamentary candidates 
voting was compulsory for those 21 or older and more than 90 
percent of the 145 million eligible cast ballots in the contested 
distsricts

revolutionary and activist organizations adriaan vlok said 
referring to the governments february decision banning most 
leading antiapartheid groups 
vlok acknowledged that restrictions against church leaders would 
bring a deafening condemnation but he added this is all 
part of the propaganda plan against south africa 
the time has come for us to tear off the masks so that people 
can see who are their friends and who are their enemies he said 
in his statement to parliament on friday 
vlok cited no religious leaders by name previously he has been 
harshly critical of antiapartheid churchmen such as archbishop 
desmond tutu winner of the 1984 nobel peace prize and rev allan 
boesak president of the world alliance of reformed churches 
vlok also said authorities have arrested 18911 people without 
charge for more than 30 days during a 26monthold state of 
emergency he said the figure includes 802 people detained since 
june 10 
antiapartheid groups say about 30000 have been held for some 
length of time

society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain

the government will soon allow foreigners into the 
pacific coast city of vladivostok which serves as home port of the 
soviet navy and has been closed to nonsoviets for decades 
izvestia said saturday 
this is no accident the government daily newspaper said in 
announcing the change first of all it is a result of the new 
political initiatives of our country 
vladivostok has in recent years become a scene and a symbol of 
new soviet efforts for better relations with the countrys eastern 
neighbors in 1986 soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev gave a major 
speech there calling for increased cooperation with asian and 
pacific nations 
izvestia did not say when vladivostok would become an open city 
but later this month an international symposium on problems of the 
asiapacific region is to be held in the city 
according to vladivostoks first deputy mayor k dulov 
gorbachev told former japanese prime minister yasuhiro nakasone 
during their moscow meeting in july that the soviets were thinking 
of allowing foreigners into the city of 565000 people 
dulov in an interview with izvestia said the international 
asiapacific symposium was proof of the serious intention to open 
the city to all 
of course today many limitations still exist as in any 
border city dulov said questions are being formulated about 
how to remove them this will take time 
izvestia quoted dulov as saying it already did not merit the 
label closed since 300 foreign delegations visited last year 
as compared to only 14 in 1985 
izvestia said there were also plans to create joint ventures 
with foreign firms and a free economic zone in the vladivostok 
area which would presumably be impossible if the city retains its 
closed status 
according to a soviet foreign ministry note delivered to moscow 
embassies in january 1978 the entire pacific maritime region where 
vladivostok is located is offlimits to foreigners save for the 
cities of khabarovsk and nakhodka and the section of the 
transsiberian railway linking them 
elsewhere in the soviet union vast tracts are closed to 
foreigners including most of the territory of the baltic republics 
of estonia latvia and lithuania and frontier areas adjacent to 
china afghanistan iran turkey finland and norway

voters on saturday rejected proposed 
changes in the constitution that opposition leaders said would have 
benefited the present labor party government 
one amendment would have have extended legislative terms for the 
house of representatives from three to four years which would have 
extended the current governments term by one year 
with onethird of the ballots counted attorney general lionel 
bowen conceded the four questions had been defeated the saddest 
thing is that it is likely to mean the end of any further move for 
constitutional reform for at least a decade he said 
bowen did not give any figures 
there were 103 million eligible voters but the final results 
and turnout will not be known until sunday because of the time 
difference between the east and west coasts 
voters cast either yes or no votes on each proposal 
the opposition liberal party had campaigned against the 
referendum saying the changes would give more power to the federal 
government of prime minister bob hawke 
the australian people have protected their constitution from 
labors tampering said liberal leader john howard the whole 
referendum campaign by the government has been a disgraceful waste 
of the taxpayers money 
voters cast ballots on the following proposals 
setting fouryear terms for members of both the house of 
representatives and senate with elections to be held simultaneously 
for the two chambers at present elections for the house are held 
every three years senators are elected for sixyear terms with 
half of the members elected every three years change election 
rules to provide each vote with the same value under the present 
alignment of electoral districts especially in the states of 
queensland and western australia the vote in sparsely populated 
rural districts has the same weight as the vote in populous urban 
districts 
constitutional recognition of local governments 
constitutional guarantees to trial by jury freedom of religion 
and fair compensation for land owners whose property is acquired by 
any government 
australias constitution was adopted in 1901 when the country a 
former british colony became an independent federation 
there were no local governments at that time and the proposal 
would have granted local governments constitutional recognition 
hawke had argued strongly for the changes in legislative terms 
saying four instead of three years was essential for any 
administration to carry out its policies

patrols 
the guerrillas then ransacked and burned many homes in the 
hamlet that has a population of about 200 according to police

villages in the central andes as protection against the guerrillas

long before oprah phil and geraldo there was 
bughouse square an openair talk show where bohemian 
intellectuals freethinkers and religious fundamentalists spoke 
from soapboxes in a city park 
that free speech tradition came to life again saturday as about 
300 people turned out for a revival of the bughouse square debates 
which faded from the scene in the 1950s with the coming of the 
television age 
bughouse square was and is a symbol of free speech and 
its a matter of honoring and reviving that tradition said leon 
despres 80 the former city council parliamentarian who was named 
the informal master of ceremonies of this years debates 
its a chance to get away from the whole tvradio portrayal of 
events said jennifer jeffris a spokeswoman for the newberry 
library sponsor of saturdays debates 
organizers said they couldnt find any wooden soapboxes but 
they did scrounge up some library footstools and made a speakers 
platform out of a plastic milk crate and a wooden board 
julius lucius echeles a prominent chicago attorney argued for 
decriminalizing drugs as some in the crowd shouted we want to 
keep drugs out of the country or whats the going price for 
coke 
other speakers held forth on such topics as the 1968 chicago 
democratic convention riots nationalized health care and the new 
generation 
alderman luis gutierrez who staged a surrogate bush vs dukakis 
presidential debate with thomas f roeser the founder of the 
conservative republican assembly of illinois said he expected more 
heckling 
its a lot calmer than a chicago city council meeting 
said gutierrez 
the debates were revived as a onceayear event in 1986 by the 
chicago bar association and the newberry library which sits 
opposite bughouse square officially known as washington square 
park 
bughouse square still attracts the occasional religious soapbox 
preacher but the library would like it once again to be a place 
for debates on a regular basis said ms jeffris 
one version of how the square got its name is that many park 
frequenters were residents of nearby bughouses a slang term 
for flophouses said terry sullivan a newberry library spokeswoman 
despres said he wanted to revive another bughouse tradition 
heckling 
nowadays people are so respectful said despres an 
independent alderman from 195575 in a council dominated by mayor 
richard j daleys democratic machine but you really have to 
remember that from time to time a speaker should be challenged if 
he makes an outrageous statement 
the bughouse square tradition modeled after speakers corner in 
londons hyde park got its start in the 1920s although the park 
itself is nearly 150 years old 
arthur weinberg a 72yearold author and social historian said 
he often spoke there on labor struggles in the 1930s 
at the time weinberg recalled the speakers would be out seven 
days a week during the summer chicagoans would to there on dates 
and tourists came as well 
you got the same thing in bughouse square as on shows like 
phil donahue said weinberg 
but the freedom that happened there was really remarkable i 
cant think of one incident when the police interfered 
weinberg said bughouse square was like an openair adult 
education school many of the speakers would research their 
topics in the newberry library by day before taking the soapbox at 
night 
but bughouse square died with the antiradical mood of the 
mccarthy era and the advent of television in the 1950s he said 
what bughouse square offered that radio and tv cant is 
the touch and closeness of the speaker you can listen to dan 
rather but you cant get close to him

a cloud of toxic chlorine gas leaked 
from an industrial plant and forced a 7hour evacuation of up to 
15000 people east of los angeles on saturday at least 37 people 
were taken to hospitals 
a halfmile long gas cloud formed just after midnight outside a 
plant that makes chlorine tablets for swimming pools authorities 
said the chemical reaction that caused the cloud was brought under 
control about nine hours later 
residents were told they could return home after getting the ok 
from the los angeles county department of health there were no 
reports of serious injuries 
an estimated 550 gallons of a chemical used to make the chlorine 
tablets apparently became contaminated setting off the reaction 
said sheriffs deputy van mosley 
the air was permeated with the smell of bleach from the the 
wispy smokygray gas that billowed from the grow group inc plant 
chlorine can be lethal in high concentrations but otherwise causes 
burning eyes and sore throats 
an estimated 10000 to 15000 people were evacuated los angeles 
county sheriffs deputy eric smith said late saturday 
this was based on estimates made at the operations command 
post smith said adding that earlier estimates made during the 
emergency may have been inaccurate 
the sheriffs department initially put the estimate of evacuees 
at up to 27000 while a press release from the montebello police 
department said an area of that city encompassing up to 19000 
people was ordered evacuated 
the american red cross said about 3000 people went to shelters 
three people were in stable condition at santa marta hospital 
and clinic said nursing supervisor verna brinson four others with 
respiratory complaints were treated at countyusc medical center 
and released said norka manning a hospital spokeswoman 
beverly hospital in montebello was flooded with patients but 
only admitted one elderly person for observation said emergency 
room nurse chuck nemejc 
we got about 30 he said most complained of throat 
tightening difficulty breathing vomiting headaches 
at the pioneer high school gym where hundreds of evacuees 
waited many said they were notified by neighbors or knocked on 
doors themselves to rouse people 
grace obrien of montebello said she bundled up her 89yearold 
mother when they left her home 
i tried not to take deep breaths she said i told my 
mother to roll up the car windows and i made an illegal uturn i 
didnt think the deputies would stop me 
like many other residents ms obrien said she didnt smell 
anything or see the chemical cloud 
didnt bother me ive been through so much tornadoes 
things like that said ms obriens mother marguerite secrist 
a former texas resident the area evacuated comprised several 
square miles in sections of east los angeles monterey park 
montebello and commerce authorities said residents were sent to 
several high schools where the red cross had set up shelters 
the plant was closed at the time of the leak said plant manager 
kim marti the sheriffs department woke us up marti said 
sheriffs deputy sam jones said the exact cause of the toxic 
cloud was undetermined but one possibility was that moisture 
seeped into the containers in the plant and activated the dry 
chemical releasing chlorine gas 
the prime suspect is moisture some moisture from 
condensation from the high humidity weve been having said les 
wilde president of grow groups consumer and professional products 
group 
however the specific cause may never be known because of the 
process by which authorities neutralized the chemical reaction he 
said 
firefighters sent a hazardous materials unit which requested 
soda ash to stabilize the chemical said hubert parker a spokesman 
for the county fire department 
the cloud drifted to the southwest threatening to close 
interstate 5 which runs the length of the state and is one of its 
busiest freeways police closed an exit ramp along the freeway the 
southern boundary of the evacuated area

dangerous fumes from burning toxic chemicals kept 
firefighters at bay saturday as they struggled to douse a 
fouralarm warehouse blaze that took 14 hours to bring under 
control officials said 
there were some chemicals in there one of them was toluene 
it is a flammable what makes it bad as a health hazard is the 
fumes and exposure to it said metrodade fire department 
spokesman john carroll 
no injuries were reported 
the fire began about 4 am at the warehouse in an industrial 
area near miami international airport and was brought under 
control at 6 pm two of the 100 firefighters on the scene were 
treated for heat exhaustion 
we really dont have a potential toxic cloud problem now 
carroll said adding that environmental officials were at the scene 
the cause of the fire was under investigation no damage 
estimate was immediately available but carroll said walls blew out 
and items inside the warehouse were heavily damaged 
the warehouse was used to store items awaiting us customs 
clearance 
while the fire spewed little smoke its toxic fumes kept 
firefighters away said carroll toluene is a poisonous colorless 
liquid used in making dyes explosives or solvents 
we had to cut holes in the roof for ventilation and part of 
the roof is sagging badly he said 
officials at first thought the tons of merchandise in the 
warehouse included 150 55gallon drums of toluene but carroll said 
there may have been more 
literally a myriad of things are in there like stereos and 
some containers that are sealed we dont know whats in there 
he said 
the department planned to bring in heavy equipment to dig 
through the material to get to the fire carroll said 
several blocks around the warehouse were closed to traffic 
but its a nonresidential area and no one was working that 
time he said officials werent sure who owned the warehouse

hurricane uleki resumed its march toward the 
hawaiian islands saturday slightly weakened but still posing a 
considerable threat forecasters reported 
we hope it will weaken so when it gets close it will have 
lost much of its punch said meteorologist clarence lee of the

southwest of honolulu or 345 miles south of lihue kauai with

miles south southeast of honolulu on friday night after making a 
surprise turn towards the islands earlier in the day 
yesterday the storm had a small tight center today its a 
large sprawling center thats ususally an indication it is 
weakening lee said 
even if hawaii is spared the storms worst winds uleki probably 
will bring strong winds and rain to the islands sometime sunday 
lee said 
uleki is still a dangerous hurricane everyone should be 
prepared he said 
a tropical storm watch was posted for the islands of oahu kauai

federal investigators said saturday that 
the copilot in the crash that killed 13 people here had no 
recollection of the crucial moments in the aircrafts cockpit 
a spokesman said investigators still had some work to do at the 
muddy wreckage site but some members of the national 
transportation safety board team were being sent back to 
washington dc 
were satisfied that we have documented the information we 
need to collect said ntsb member lee dickinson at a news 
briefing saturday night our field phase is winding down 
dickinson said team members interviewed copilot wilson 
kirkland but he had no recollection of the wednesday morning crash 
of delta flight 1141 from the time the plane left the gate at 
dallasfort worth international airport until thursday night in the 
hospital 
kirkland was released from a suburban hospital saturday the 
ntsb has not interviewed capt larry davis who was flying the 
craft 
davis 48 was in fair condition at parkland memorial hospital 
but dickinson said davis doctor had not given investigators 
permission to talk to him my information is he is not medically 
fit to talk to he said but later added they hope to interview 
davis in three or four days 
nbc news on saturday and the washington posts sunday editions 
reported that the cockpit crew talked as they taxied to the end of 
the runway about the 1985 delta flight 191 crash that killed 137 
at the airport 
the newspapers source who listened to the jets cockpit voice 
recording said the crew talked about politics and a recent 
controversy about a portion of a cockpit recording in the crash of 
a continental airlines jet last november in denver 
dickinson said saturday night that he had not heard the cockpit 
voice recording nor read the newspapers report but added if in 
our analysis we decide thats pertinent information well analyze 
it 
dickinson said the noise of the engines going to full power are 
the last sounds heard on the cockpit recorder before impact 
investigators saturday also determined the plane had a normal 
takeoff roll using about 50 percent of the 11300foot runway 
earlier the ntsb said the planes short flight may have been 
affected by a long takeoff roll 
no signs of damage have been found on any of the boeing 727s 
three engines which were shipped saturday to pratt amp whitney in 
hartford conn dickinson said one of the engines wound up 
separated from the fuselage in the crash 
cranes and trucks hoisted engines and the cockpit from the 
wreckage saturday afternoon as some 30 people in hip boots and bib 
overalls slogged through ankledeep mud searching for clues 
ninetyfive people survived when the plane en route to salt 
lake city crashed and burst into flame on takeoff 
the accident represented the first reallife test of a plane 
fitted with seats and carpets made of new fireblocking materials 
required by the federal aviation administration experts said 
while it is not known how large a role the fireresistant 
materials played in buying time for the 95 survivors they may have 
helped said john mazor spokesman for the air line pilots 
association in washington 
just looking at the airplane the scorch marks and the way it 
broke up on impact typically you might have expected a greater 
number of fatalities out of an accident like that he said we 
wont know how we were so lucky until we get more factual 
information and some analysis 
the wreckage was visible to passengers of planes landing or 
taking off but its delta logo had been covered with white paint 
saturday 
funerals for three of the victims were held saturday services 
were held friday for a dallas couple and a veteran delta flight 
attendant 
the ntsb teams concentrated on inconsistencies regarding the 
planes wing flaps and engines 
evidence has not yet confirmed witness accounts that the 
engines trailed flame during takeoff said bernard loeb ntsb 
deputy director of investigations 
no signs of damage have been found on any of the engines which 
will be shipped to pratt amp whitney in hartford conn 
investigators said 
although cockpit instruments told crew members that the wing 
flaps were in proper position for takeoff inspections of the 
wreckage found that the flaps and slats appeared to be in the 
opposite of the correct position investigators said 
ntsb officials said locking devices on the slats probably would 
have prevented them from being knocked out of position during the 
crash 
flight engineer steven judd interviewed in his hospital room 
friday told investigators he remembered pilot larry davis saying 
15 15 green indicating the instruments showed the flaps were 
at the proper 15 degree angle for takeoff dickinson said 
dickinson said the inspectors would review deltas operations 
procedures to see if the flaps might have been brought up as a 
response to emergency engine failure he said they also needed to 
reconstruct the history of the crew how much rest the members had 
before the flight if they had worked together before and other 
factors that may have affected performance

parks northeastern entrance 
winds largely pushed fires to the southwest saturday away from 
west yellowstone wyo where volunteers put down 2 miles of 
irrigation pipe to moisten the ground between the flames and the 
tourist town 
however forecasts called for the winds to come from the 
southwest again by monday which could blow the fire back toward 
west yellowstone

emphasis on extinguishing a spot fire near west yellowstone 
airport as winds did not push the main body of the fire any closer 
to the community than 1 mile

whose sex change operation nearly four decades ago led to a career 
as a nightclub entertainer and writer is battling spreading cancer 
on friday she started a new round of chemotherapy treatments at 
mission hospital regional medical center in mission viejo in an 
effort to stave off the cancer that has spread from her bladder to 
her lungs 
fighting the disease is allconsuming and incredibly 
inconvenient she told the orange county register 
ms jorgensen 62 learned she had cancer last year 
the day ms jorgensen learned she had the same disease that 
killed her mother in 1967 ms jorgensen went home and took a long 
look at herself in her bathroom mirror 
i said to myself look youve coped with a lot already you 
can handle this too so you might as well get on with it 
because of the expensive chemotherapy and two operations to 
remove tumors ms jorgensen had to sell her 3000square foot 
laguna niguel home she and her 7yearold terrier bonnie have 
been living in a threebedroom apartment here 
ms jorgensens story made world headlines 37 years ago when she 
went to copenhagen denmark as george jorgensen jr and returned 
as christine jorgensen 
with the unanticipated limelight she joined the lecture and 
nightclub circuit authored books met royalty and celebrities 
found new gentlemen friends and ended up with enough money jewels 
and furs to provide a comfortable lifestyle 
ms jorgensen insists she has no regrets about the operation and 
is proud to have been part of the sexual revolution 
she acknowledged time has taken its toll getting myself 
together takes a little more effort these days 
but its also had its advantages she said im not that 
recognizable anymore i can actually go into a supermarket and 
people dont know who i am which is just wonderful and suits me 
just fine 
despite her timeconsuming treatments ms jorgensen said she 
still has time for reading and preparing her second autobiography 
she hopes to work with other cancer patients someday she said 
but added cancer is quite unforgiving its the kind of thing 
that prevents you from making terribly longrange plans

airline safety has been threatened by more than 2000 ball bearings 
used in boeing 737 747 and 757 jetliners manufactured in the last 
two years it was reported friday 
a lawsuit filed in federal court last week by an airplane parts 
manufacturing company alleged the ball bearings were counterfeit

bought the planes 
since july 1 1986 boeing has manufactured 490 boeing 737 747

engines similar to those on the delta air 
lines jet that crashed in dallas have malfunctioned 28 times in the 
past five years but have not caused any accidents federal aviation 
administration records show 
the pratt amp whitney jt8d model 15 engines have failed on 
liftoff suffered minor explosions during takeoff and vibrated in 
flight according to records provided friday by the faas office in 
oklahoma city 
investigators of wednesdays crash at the dallasfort worth 
international are studying the boeing 727 jets three engines and 
the position of its wing flaps as they search for the cause of the 
crash that killed 13 people 
bobbie mardis of the faas public affairs office said the faa 
records covered five years we asked for a printout of accidents 
or incidents where the jt8d15 was a contributing factor to 
whatever happened she said 
on the printout drawn from the faas accidentincident report 
each example was listed as an incident 
there were no accidents as a result of engine problems 
according to the computer ms mardis said 
in one case takeoff was aborted when a douglass dc9 leaving a 
new york airport in june 1983 lost power in the right engine 
causing smoke and flames to come out of the engine the report said 
the cause was third stage turbine failure 
as a boeing 727 was taking off from an ohio airport in april of 
this year a loud bang was heard the number three engine turbine 
had failed with parts spraying on runway takeoff aborted no 
fire the report said 
in april 1984 an explosion occurred in an engine during the 
takeoff and initial climb of a boeing 727 causing a loss of the 
hydraulic system

an america west airlines jetliner carrying 
38 passengers nearly landed at a small airport before the pilot 
recognized the mistake and pulled out 1000 feet above the narrow 
runway it was reported friday 
the boeing 737 landed safely thursday night at the larger 
durangola plata county airport its correct destination five 
miles to the east of animas air park 
the federal aviation administration began investigating the 
incident involving flight 1240 after inquiries by the durango 
herald which reported the mixup 
america west also is investigating the incident said kathy 
christianson manager of corporate communications for the 
phoenixbased airline 
the durango airport has no tower so the two pilots were 
following instruments she said the pilots did what we call a 
flyaround and landed at the durango airport 
john ford an apprentice mechanic at animas air park who was an 
eyewitness said it appeared the aircraft was going to land at the 
air park 
ford said air park officials didnt radio the jet but the pilot 
pulled out of the landing pattern himself apparently realizing the 
mistake 
the runway was clear at the time and a landing posed no danger 
to people on the ground however the widebodied jet would have 
encountered severe complications if it tried to land ford said 
noting the runway is only 50 feet wide and shorter than the 
commercial airports 
if he knew what he was doing he could have pulled it off he 
said but the landing would be possible only if the pilot were 
aware of the runways smaller size 
sue vonkersburg was walking her dog near animas air park when 
she noticed the planes lights in the distance 
i realized it was quite a large plane i could see writing on 
the fuselage then i heard him start to give it power i knew 
he had made a mistake before he did vonkersburg said 
she said she called america west at the durangola plata county 
airport to report the incident and was told the airline already had 
received five calls

barge traffic moved smoothly but slowly on 
the lower mississippi river on friday prompting the coast guard to 
relax restrictions on towboat loads imposed because of low water 
weve gotten to the point where we have a very stable 
channel said michael donohoe commander of the coast guard 
district from caruthersville mo to greenville miss 
towboat operators restricted to a maximum of 16 barges since 
june will likely increase their loads to 20 barges and some may go 
to 25 donohoe said 
towboats on the lower mississippi often push 25 barges this time 
of year and in high water can handle 30 to 40 barge operators say 
they will lose 200 million this year because of the low water 
caused by this years severe drought 
the coast guard also limited barges to drafts of 85 feet 
meaning the weight of their loads had to be limited the barges 
generally draw nine feet of water 
the drought caused the river to drop more than 20 feet below 
normal at memphis in july 
it still was 12 feet below normal friday at memphis but donohoe 
said dredging by the army corps of engineers and successes in 
keeping towboat traffic moving have reduced the worst shoaling in 
the river 
the shipping channel is at least 11 feet deep throughout the 
375mile memphis district he said 
the coast guard said 126 groundings have been reported in the 
memphis district since the first of june with 41 occurring in a 
single week in july

he said the payload was useless on that course and there was

prehistoric american civilizations were not 
built by transplanted egyptians or wandering ancient astronauts 
says archaeologist wilburn sonny cockrell of florida state 
university 
the origin of the mound builders of north america and the 
pyramid and city dwellers of central and south america is explored 
on the search for ancient americans on public television 
wednesday night 
a number of people particularly in this century have come to 
an almost racist view of the american indians said cockrell 
they look at the high civilizations these ancient people built 
at their complex cultures and monumental achievements and refuse 
to accept that they were american aboriginals 
popular writers from the 18th century on looked at the mounds 
at the anasazi pueblos in new mexico at the ruins of cities in 
central and south america and said they must have been built by 
some vanished race later writers came up with the notion of 
egyptians and ancient astronauts 
cockrell says the early americans crossed a land bridge that 
connected asia and western north america in the ice age 
due to the milethick continental glaciers the oceans were 
300 feet lower allowing these first immigrants to enter the new 
world cockrell said in a telephone interview from warm mineral 
springs fla where he is director for fsus archaeological 
research project 
there were several waves of immigrants and this show depicts 
what scientists know about these people and their descendants we 
survey them over a wide geographic range and over a long temporal 
range and look into questions as to why particular cultural 
manifestations arose and why they disappeared 
the onehour documentary is part of the infinite voyage 
series and will appear later on some commercial stations the show 
is a joint venture of pbs and the national academy of sciences and 
was produced by wqedtv in pittsburgh 
cockrell is serving as spokesman for the show although he 
appears on the broadcast only in sequences about his project 
recovering the 12000yearold remains and artifacts of 
paleoindians from a sink hole 
the search for ancient americans will be followed in 
subsequent weeks by reruns of four shows from last season 
the celestial observations of the native americans 
specifically central americans were more sophisticated and had 
greater accuracy than those of western civilization he said 
their understanding of astronomical events and the 
interrelationship of celestial movements extends back at least one 
millennium before the birth of christ and probably earlier 
they had the concept of the zero before westerners the 
postclassic mayans had libraries full of books called codices 
which extensively documented mayan culture these libraries were 
destroyed by the spanish who assumed that since these indians 
werent christian their ability to read and write was in conflict 
with the spanish concept of god 
the documentary ranges from the nowsubmerged land bridge 
between siberia and alaska to the junglecovered pyramids in 
central america the trek of the first immigrants from asia is 
recreated by a group of native americans 
the program then moves ahead to warm mineral springs where 
cockrell heads the archaeologists and paleontologists recovering 
remains of the paleoindians inland from cape canaveral fla 
another fsu group led by dr glen doran is shown excavating a 
7000yearold cemetery from the archaic period 
the recovery of the skeleton of a 16yearold male who 
suffered from spina bifida indicates that the people were 
compassionate and economically stable enough to care for a helpless 
member of their group throughout his life he said 
the show then goes to chaco canyon nm where national park 
service archaeologists and their colleagues are looking into the 
complex civilization of the vanished anasazi culture 
archaeologists are careful to use the term culture said 
cockrell people dont vanish but cultures vanish people live 
on but adopt or become participants in other cultures its rare 
that an entire population vanishes such as the concept of atlantis 
falling into the sea 
the civilization of atlantis did not vanish into the sea the 
myth refers to the dissolution of the culture of the minoan crete 
probably by the eruption of a volcano the people remained to 
become the inhabitants of the greek islands and classical greece 
cockrell said nonprofit educational institutions are encouraged 
to videotape the show the digital equipment corp has distributed 
25000 teaching guides to schools

american farmers dwindling in number 
stricken by drought and plagued by chronic money woes are proving 
they can still produce a bumper crop of political power on capitol 
hill 
farmers have got the votes and they get pandered to because 
theyve got the votes says rep sam gibbons dfla one of just 
29 house members who voted against this summers 39 billion 
drought relief legislation 
most lawmakers said farmers deserved help after drought wrecked 
37 percent of the corn crop 23 percent of the soybeans and tore 
into the harvest of spring wheat most also agree the price tag 
looks bigger than it is because it falls within the amount the 
government stands to save because of drought 
three factors powered the bill from the hopper to the 
presidents desk in less than a month one was the traditional 
american generosity toward hardpressed family farmers lawmakers 
cited it repeatedly 
in this country we have a tradition of helping someone who 
through no fault of his own winds up behind the eight ball says 
rep edward r madigan rill the top republican on the house 
agriculture committee 
there is the presumption that farming as a way of life is 
somehow morally superior rep barney frank dmass a critic of 
farm spending declares caustically 
another factor that fuels farm bills officials said was a keen 
awareness that blocs of farm voters can swing close elections in 
many states politicians often trace the 1986 unseating of sens 
james abnor rsd and mark andrews rnd to dissatisfaction 
with the farm economy 
every senator has some agriculture in his state observers 
house minority counsel hyde murray a longtime observer of farm 
politics he says lawmakers who must pay close heed to the wishes 
of such voters number well over 100 in the 435member house 
such pressures were at work not only in shaping the drought 
legislation but a wideranging 1985 blueprint for snapping the farm 
economy out of stagnation that plagued it throughout the early 
1980s 
while revitalizing markets the measure also sent the cost of 
subsidies to a 1986 peak of 26 billion and sent milliondollar 
payments to corporate farmers 
widespread complaints about the cost resulted in a decision by 
congress to cap most individual payments at 50000 and a few 
exceptions at 250000 approval of programs was preceded by heavy 
lobbying among producers groups 
likewise the drought bill signed by president reagan on aug 11 
contains an aboutface in dairy policy that will cost taxpayers an 
estimated 185 million to 200 million approval of the provisions 
represented a distinct victory for dairy farmers 
such measures are as old as congress indeed farm programs go 
back to colonial times and the marble columns resembling corn 
stalks and tobacco plants in the capitol vestibule suggest 
farmings special place 
price supports a floor under crop prices with government 
serving as the buyer of last resort arrived with the depression 
and now form the bedrock of us farm policy since then congress 
also has spawned income supports conservation payments and export 
subsidies to keep farmers afloat 
as farm numbers have dwindled however some farm groups have 
increasingly adopted campaign contributions to help make their 
voice heard in washington 
i think statements that farmers always get their way are 
overblown says agricultural consultant william lesher but 
there are exceptions 
sugar and dairy are two tough ones he says they just 
seem to do their jobs and get their way i think it has to do with 
campaign contributions and i think it has more to do with the size 
of their campaign contributions than with their persuasiveness in 
making their case 
huge dairy cooperatives have led all of agriculture in campaign 
contributions for a decade and plunged millions of dollars into 
house and senate races in the last two years the dallasbased 
associated milk producers inc has contributed 349950 to 195 
candidates 
it gave a total of 891950 to candidates in the 1986 election 
to rank 23rd among the 3187 groups registered with the federal 
election commission 
by comparison the national association of realtors reported 
2751588 in contributions to 1986 campaigns to rank no1 and 16 
groups in all handed out 1 million or more in political donations 
that year 
the no2 coop midamerica dairymen inc has contributed 
241400 to 225 candidates over the last two years it donated 
467500 to 1986 campaigns to rank 47th among groups registered 
with the federal election commission 
four of the five top cooperatives contributing to 1986 
candidates were dairy groups they gave a total of 1680168 
sixteen of the top 50 cooperatives were dairy groups according to 
commission records 
our dairy farmers out there have a lot of cows says 
midamerica lobbyist frank vacca and those cows are their 
producers i like to say that ive got 535 producers up here on 
capitol hill 
were here to represent our constituents who are good 
producers and if we have some good producing congressmen and 
senators and presidents and we can help them by contributing to 
their campaigns whats wrong with that 
congress produced for dairy farmers in the drought bill 
canceling a cut in price supports of 50 cents for each 100 pounds 
of milk and imposing instead a temporary threemonth increase of 
50 cents per hundredweight 
critics also often grumble that campaign contributions are vital 
in helping sugar producers to maintain import restrictions that 
raise prices considerably for american consumers 
theres little question that campaign contributions have 
sweetened the pot of support for the sugar program in congress 
says ellen haas executive director of washingtonbased public 
voice for food and health policy 
she noted in a report issued in 1986 that on a key vote to ease 
import curbs 263 members voting against the measure had received 
received a total of 743021 in campaign funds from 18 sugargrower 
organizations over the previous four years the 142 voting to lift 
restrictions had reaped only 85300 in such contributions 
votes on the auction block nonsense farm lawmakers say 
its totally absurd and insulting really to those of us who 
have been friends of the sugar industry says house agriculture 
committee chairman e kika de la garza dtexas some of whose 
homefolks are cane producers 
if i have to choose between the rio grande valley and some 
foreign country you can imagine which one ill choose he adds 
reagan administration efforts since then to budge sugar tariffs 
however have come to nought 
nothing has happened with our bill says richard w 
goldberg acting undersecretary of agriculture for international 
activities and commodity programs theres just insufficient 
support to get it moving 
he says the reason is that so many agriculture committee members 
have sugar producers in their district and almost all of them have 
constituents who grow corn whose price is closely linked to that 
of sugar 
they kind of help each other says goldberg

he was the spiritual father of american folk 
music an artist with a social consciousness who captured the 
hopes dreams joys and sorrows of a nation in such political 
anthems and protest songs as this land is your land 
his name was woody guthrie and he inspired generations of 
singers and composers including pete seeger bob dylan and his 
son arlo guthrie 
but if guthrie was the spiritual daddy of folk music then 
leadbelly huddie ledbetter was its granddaddy 
the two heroes who carved a music for the common people are 
celebrated on a new album folkways a vision shared subtitled 
a tribute to woody guthrie and leadbelly 
the album the brainchild of bob dylan features performances of 
guthrie and leadbellys work by such artists as dylan seeger 
bruce springsteen arlo guthrie u2 little richard john cougar 
mellencamp willie nelson sweet honey in the rock emmylou harris 
and taj mahal 
royalties from the lp will be donated to the smithsonian 
institution which bought folkways records last year from the estate 
of its founder moses asch the birch tree group of princeton 
nj now manages marketing and distribution folkways was a label 
that championed folk music and its stars and is perhaps the most 
complete library of folk music in existence 
asch son of novelist sholem asch founded the folkways label in 
1947 with recordings of leadbelly and such countryblues musicians 
as jack dupree big bill broonzy sonny terry and brown mcghee 
mo asch who died in 1986 at the age of 81 was interested in 
documenting traditional music and sounds from around the world 
folkways recorded guthrie and seeger as well as jazz 
appalachian music gospel spoken words speeches poetry and 
plays childrens songs ragtime environmental sounds from 
street noises to the conversation of frogs and traditional music 
from around the world asch produced more than 2100 records during 
his 50year career and tried to keep them all available for sale to 
the general public and as a reference resource for scholars 
showtime will air a special about the project on sept 17 with 
footage from some of the recording sessions and an interview with 
springsteen who often includes a guthrie song or two in his 
concerts in october a vision shared will go on sale in video 
stores 
springsteen sings i aint got no home and vigilante man 
both written by guthrie brian wilson sings leadbellys goodnight 
irene dylan sings guthries pretty boy floyd 
dylan was fascinated by guthrie from the first time he ever 
heard one of his records growing up in minnesota he visited 
guthrie in the hospital during his last days and cheered the 
composer by singing his songs to him guthrie died at creedmoor 
state hospital in new york in 1967 at the age of 55 following a 
13year battle with huntingtons chorea 
dylan wrote a guthriestyle talking blues for his first record 
album when the smithsonian bought folkways which included 
recordings by guthrie 19121967 and leadbelly 18851949 plus 
the woody guthrie archives it was suggested to dylan that he give 
a benefit concert to help pay for it he suggested more might by 
raised by a recording 
joe mcewen artists and repertory director at columbia records 
and one of four executive producers of a vision shared 
recently talked about the significance of the record 
i think the fact that these songs can still be translated into 
the 1980s shows that this music its passions and experiences are 
universal he said the fact that contemporary artists are 
interpreting these songs shows theyre still as vital today as when 
originally written 
these are great american folk songs part of a tradition that 
will always be with us i think its encumbent upon us to keep 
reinvestigating this tradition 
mcewen couldnt predict how the lp released aug 23 would sell 
the executive producers made a list of some 40 performers 
giving no preference to those signed to columbia records to be 
invited to perform 
dylan had done his song that gave the project some 
credibility mcewen said most artists chose the songs they 
performed executive producers made sure they didnt duplicate and 
sometimes suggested tunes 
this land is your land was obviously designated for pete 
seeger from the beginning and rock island line seemed to make a 
lot of sense for little richard it sounded like his kind of song 
doc watson plays guitar with seeger who sometimes performed on 
the same bill with guthrie and leadbelly in his youth and at 69 
continues to sing songs by both of them the los angeles rock 
group fishbone performs with little richard 
we wanted a real crosssection of different styles of music i 
think we achieved that said mcewen 
asking performers and getting responses was quick he said so 
fast that there wasnt time to take volunteers performers and 
their own producers then went into recording studios around the 
country during a year and a half u2 the irish superstars and only 
nonamerican participants used the sun studios in memphis tenn 
during an american tour 
the general idea in recording mcewen says was simplicity 
to maintain the integrity of the original sound while doing a 
personal interpretation 
brian wilsons goodnight irene doesnt sound like 
leadbellys its probably the most different from the original on 
the album 
mcewen has been asked why there isnt one cut each by guthrie 
and leadbelly i didnt think of it and it was never brought up 
in conversations any of us had he said 
i think the smithsonian is doing a record of the original 
versions of these same songs

with a ceasefire in place iran and 
iraq can turn to rebuilding their wardamaged oil industries 
raising the prospect of a fresh surge in oil production and a fal 
in crude prices some analysts say 
but others argue the newly enacted truce will help bring an end 
to squabbles within the arabdominated organization of petroleum 
exporting countries enabling the oil cartel to strengthen its grip 
on world markets 
if opec is politically stronger than it was during the war 
then its capacity for controlling oil prices will be stronger 
also said pierre terzian editor of the parisbased oil 
publication petrostrategies 
this past week subroto the secretarygeneral of the cartel 
capped off a series of meetings with oil producers by visiting 
officials in both iran and iraq the aim of the meetings was to win 
cooperation in curbing production by opec members to bolster 
sagging prices 
although the meetings produced no immediate results subroto 
promised to continue his search for a solution to the cartels 
overproduction problems 
terzian predicted prices would firm in the coming months in the 
range of 16 to 18 a barrel opecs target price is pegged at 18 
a barrel but prices on the spot market have been running 3 to 4 
below that level 
london oil consultant paul mcdonald however looks for prices 
to slide in a market already awash in crude 
the pressure is going to be on iran and iraq to produce more 
oil because they need more money he said 
a ceasefire means increased oil production said peter 
gignoux director of the international energy department at the 
shearson lehman hutton brokerage in london 
iraq already plans to expand its export capacity with a new 
pipeline through saudi arabia to the red sea 
theyre planning to export more oil mcdonald said 
theyre not building the pipeline for fun theyre going to 
use it 
a key to controlling any increased production analysts said is 
opecs ability to bring iraq back into the fold of the 13nation 
cartel 
iraq has in the past ignored its opec production quota of 154 
million barrels a day demanding a share equal to irans 237 
million barrels a day iraq pumps an estimated 28 million barrels 
a day in defiance of the quotas analysts say 
in his meetings subroto tried to persuade iran to allow iraq a 
higher quota 
theres no longer any obstacle for iraq to get back in the 
quota system said terzian 
nick antill oil analyst with the london brokerage county 
natwest said if iraq can be reintegrated on quota parity with 
iran theres no real reason why prices cant be manipulated up 
to opecs 18 a barrel target 
the 8year persian gulf war caused widespread damage to the two 
countries oil industries 
petrologistics a genevabased oil consulting firm estimated 
war damage to iraqs oil facilities at 85 billion and destruction 
to irans operations at 25 billion 
both countries are turning out oil well under their prewar 
highs of about 6 million barrels a day for iran in 1974 and 35 
million barrels a day for iraq in 1979 
petrologistics estimates iran could boost production to 32 
million barrels a day in a year and to 42 million barrels in five 
years iraqs output could climb to 37 million barrels a day by 
mid1989 and 5 million barrels in 1993 it said 
during the war iraq aided by money from its gulf neighbors 
built pipelines through saudi arabia and turkey to carry out its 
export oil bypassing warravaged facilities on the gulf 
iran is likely to face a much tougher task than iraq in 
boosting its postwar output and production capacity said 
petrologistics 
some major onshore fields have been irreparably damaged over 
the past 10 years due to mature age neglect and war damage it 
said 
theyve probably lost billions of barrels of reserves said 
mcdonald 
kharg island irans key tanker terminal in the persian gulf 
was badly pounded by iraqs powerful air force as were refining 
facilities and oilfields 
indeed iran which once exported refined oil products was 
forced to turn to other countries to meet its internal demand 
its an oilrich society that cannot refine its own internal 
needs said gignoux 
with the war winding down the two countries must decide whether 
to restore their oil industries to their prewar might 
if they want to go back to what they were that will require 
billions and billions of dollars of investments in the coming 
years said terzian 
they will have the financial ability he said they have 
the technical ability foreign service companies are eager to get 
contracts there is a golden opportunity for them in iran and 
iraq

the bond market is getting a powerful lift from 
signs that the pace of economic growth is slowing but some 
analysts worry that a decline in the dollar could spoil the party 
the governments report on friday that the nations civilian 
unemployment rate jumped to 56 percent in august from 54 percent 
in july was the catalyst for one of the bond markets most forceful 
rallies of the year 
what heartened the market was not so much the widelyanticipated 
increase in the unemployment rate but the accompanying statistics 
that indicated a slowdown in new job creation and little if any 
increase in wages 
trading volume in the bond market had slowed to trickle in 
advance of the report as some bond dealers suspected it would 
confirm their worst fears that the economy was growing so rapidly 
that it would ignite inflation and force the federal reserve to 
restrain it 
but the report had only pleasant surprises for many bond 
analysts 
by midafternoon friday prices of some 30year treasury bonds 
were up about 25 for every 1000 in face value that gain was the 
biggest since a 26 per 1000 in face value rise on jan 15 the 
markets best day of 1988 
the price rise trimmed yields on the 30year issue often viewed 
as an indication of broader interest rate trends at midafternoon 
the 30year bond yielded 905 percent down from 930 percent late 
thursday and from 943 percent at the end of trading in the 
previous week 
some analysts said the unemployment report may mark a turning 
point from which interest rates will trend lower through the end of 
the year 
elliott platt director of fixedincome research for donaldson 
lufkin amp jenrette securities corp said there is a very good 
chance that rates have peaked 
platt said the trade deficit contraction and business spending 
on equipment are slowing he noted that earlier this past week the 
government reported a 08 percent decline in its leading indicators 
index for july and a 35 percent drop in manufacturing orders to 
factories he said the unemployment report suggests that the 
slowdown may be here 
he expects longterm yields will sink to 85 percent by yearend 
but many economists say it is too early to call a turning point 
in rate trends and expect rates will head higher 
harold nathan senior financial economist at wells fargo amp co 
in san francisco said he expects longterm yields could reach 10 
percent by the end of the year and 105 percent next year 
nathan said the unemployment report showed some weakness in 
the labor markets that we have not seen in some time but added 
it does not reflect a sharp economic slowdown 
we are growing at a more sustainable but strong pace of 
activity the bottom line is that there is still enough strength to 
put inflationary pressures on the economy he said 
sung won sohn chief economist for norwest corp in minneapolis 
said the unemployment report takes pressure off the fed to push up 
shortterm rates 
but he said the economy is still doing fairly well and as a 
result feels this is a temporary pause not a peak in interest 
rates 
sohn said foreign central banks have raised their interest rates 
by much more than the us central bank has this year and that the 
dollar will probably come under pressure because of that 
a declining dollar could reduce foreign demand for securities 
denominated in dollars such as treasury notes and bonds that could 
result in increasing pressure to raise rates to find buyers for the 
issues 
sohn expects 30year bond yields of 10 percent by the end of the 
year 
william v sullivan jr director of money market research for 
dean witter reynolds inc said he thinks it is too early to say if 
the unemployment report marks a turning point for the credit 
markets 
if the dollar plunges in reaction to signs of an economic 
slowdown it is possible that the bond market has to give up some of 
these gains he said 
in the meantime he said he expects bond professionals are 
reconsidering their exposures just in case the slowdown turns 
out to be lasting

commodity traders are betting on a breakdown of the glutted 
cocoa markets sputtering pricesupport machine as the 38 
nationmembers of the international cocoa organization prepare for 
two weeks of talks in london 
with cocoa prices at 12year lows supplies at an alltime high 
and the worlds top producer threatening to pull out of the 
pricesupport agreement a crisis atmosphere likely will prevail at 
mondays opening session of the iccos semiannual meeting 
analysts said 
blend in the icco secretariats recommendation to suspend levies 
on cocoa sales the primary financial support of the 
producerconsumer cooperative and things are looking pretty 
awful for cocoa bulls said sandra kaul cocoa market analyst 
with shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
there are expectations that these meetings are going to break 
down that they will come up with no new means of price support and 
that they are going to suspend the call for producer levies she 
said 
cocoa prices generally have been falling since early 1984 when 
it became apparent that production during the october 
1983september 1984 crop year would significantly exceed demand 
the surplus has risen each year since then arthur stevenson 
cocoa market analyst with prudentialbache securities inc 
estimated that world cocoa stocks on sept 30 the end of the 
current crop year will stand at 705000 metric tons compared with 
594000 metric tons last year 
stocks are expected to increase to nearly 900000 metric tons 
an alltime high in the upcoming crop year he said a metric ton 
is about 2205 pounds 
that is a massive massive burden overhanging the market 
stevenson said in a telephone interview cocoa consumption 
meanwhile has been going up only very slowly he said 
the surplus has weighed heavily on prices the price for 
nearmonth delivery of cocoa on new yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa 
exchange has fallen from about 2800 a metric ton in early january 
1984 to 1202 on friday 
the drop in cocoa prices has had little impact on chocolatebar 
prices because cocoa is a relatively small ingredient in chocolate 
confections stevenson said candy bar prices also reflect 
manufacturers costs for milk sugar packaging and marketing 
besides stevenson said if people eat one chocolate bar a 
week theyre not going to start eating five chocolate bars a week 
because prices are marginally lower 
yet cocoagrowing countries keep increasing their output hoping 
to make up for lower prices by selling more 
the icco is supposed to help support prices by buying surplus 
cocoa and keeping it off the market in a buffer stock but the 
current icco agreement which began in 1987 and runs through 
september 1990 limits the buffer stock to 250000 metric tons and 
it is already at that level stevenson said 
even if icco members should agree to increase the bufferstock 
limit the organization would still be strapped for cash with which 
to buy the cocoa 
the agreement requires cocoaproducing countries to pay the icco 
a 30 levy on every ton of cocoa they export but the largest 
producers including the ivory coast and brazil have stopped 
paying the levies 
producers owe the icco about 70 million in levies of which at 
least 48 million is owed by the ivory coast analysts said 
the icco secretariat has proposed to do away with the levies a 
suggestion that will be debated at the london meeting but analysts 
say the secretariats proposed alternative selling some of the 
bufferstock cocoa to finance icco operations would only drive 
prices down further and exacerabte the problem 
stevenson said some producer nations have suggested that all 
producers withhold some cocoa from the market to drive up prices 
that idea is not likely to fly he said because it is opposed by 
other producers including no 2 brazil 
the ivory coast is the worlds top cocoa producer last year it 
produced 590000 metric tons of cocoa or 29 percent of the world 
supply 
this past week ivory coast officials reportedly said the icco 
was dying and that unless solutions to the markets dilemmas were 
found it would withdraw from the icco at the end of the current 
agreement 
but analysts saw no easy solutions 
the icco agreement simply cannot circumvent supplydemand 
realties stevenson said the agreement does not have control 
where it is most needed it cannot cut back on production nor can 
it boost consumption

the economys vigorous growth slowed in august 
but new orders remained high enough to assure robust growth through 
the third quarter the nations purchasing managers said in a 
report released monday 
the purchasing managers index slipped to 562 in august from 
590 in july and a yearly peak of 593 in june the national 
association of purchasing management said 
an index above 50 percent generally indicates an economy is 
expanding 
if the august level continued for the rest of the year it would 
be consistent with economic growth of 37 percent said robert 
bretz chairman of the organizations business survey committee 
the purchasing managers report is closely watched by economists 
because it gives solid clues to the direction of the economy in a 
change this month the report includes indexes for each of six 
specific economic indicators as well as the composite index 
new orders expanded for the 39th consecutive month but less 
rapidly the index fell to 599 from 621 in july and a peak of 
627 in june 
production expanded for the 25th consecutive month taking 
seasonal factors into consideration but the index was down sharply 
to 582 from 627 in july and 631 in june 
deliveries by vendors slowed but the rate of slowing was less 
than reported in previous months the proportion of members 
reporting faster deliveries 7 percent was the highest since may 
1987 slow deliveries are a sign that suppliers cant keep up with 
strong demand the index fell to 581 from 588 in july 
inventories fell in august after rising in july considering 
seasonal factors the index fell to 486 from 551 in july 
prices rose but there was a hint that the rate of increase may 
be slowing the index fell to 787 from 811 in july and was the 
lowest since 741 in march slowing increases in metals were offset 
by rapid increases for farm products caused by the drought 
employment increased considering seasonal factors for the 
third consecutive month after three months of decline the index 
fell to 507 from 517 in july 
on buying policies purchasing managers ordered production 
materials farther ahead of time to cope with the slowdown in vendor 
deliveries lead times of 30 days or less for production materials 
were reported by 51 percent of purchasers down from 56 percent in 
july 
lead times were about the same for capital expenditures and 
somewhart shorter for maintenance repair and operating supplies 
the report is based on surveys of purchasing executives in more 
than 250 industrial companies in 21 industries in all 50 states 
the organization has nearly 30000 members

wall streeters are hoping for some extra cause 
to celebrate with the arrival of the traditional business new 
year at labor day 
first of all they would like to see investors and traders back 
from the diversions of summer helping to pick up the tempo from 
the anemic pace of activity in recent weeks 
in addition they see some preliminary signs of relief from the 
constant talk lately of toorapid economic growth revived 
inflation and credittightening by the federal reserve 
spirits in the financial community got a big boost on friday 
when the labor department reported slowerthanexpected employment 
growth for august and revised downward its figure for july as 
well both the stock and bond markets responded quickly with strong 
gains 
that of course put traders in the familiar but still awkward 
position of seeming to applaud an increase in the unemployment 
rate in this case to 56 percent in august from 54 percent in 
july 
but the standard interpretation of the data among financial 
analysts was that it signaled moderating growth in the economy and 
less cause to worry about inflation 
alan greenspan chairman of the federal reserve has made clear 
with both words and action his concern of late that inflationary 
pressures were building 
moves by the fed to restrain those pressures by tightening 
credit conditions have produced a steady increase in shortterm 
interest rates 
in the view of many analysts the new employment data raise the 
possibility that the central bank wont feel obliged to tighten 
credit any further at least through the november elections 
the latest evidence suggests the current structure of 
shortterm rates is too high said tom carpenter chief economist 
at asb capital management in washington 
a couple more months of moderate earnings gains should cause 
short rates to go down 
joseph feshbach an analyst at prudentialbache securities 
argues that september should cool off the bond markets 
overheated anxieties 
i believe that before the year is out well see a very sharp 
bond rally as it becomes evident that the fear of inflation has 
been blown out of all proportion he said in a commentary 
published before fridays report 
thanks to the rally on friday the dow jones average of 30 
industrials finished the past week with a net gain of 3716 points 
at 205459 
the new york stock exchange composite index rose 242 to 14966 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market gained 
208 to 37651 and the american stock exchange market value index 
was up 175 at 29562 
volume on the big board averaged 12848 million shares a day up 
from 11729 million the week before 
the rise in interest rates here and overseas should eventually 
begin to cool demand says david resler chief economist at 
nomura securities international in new york 
so far available data suggest that the late secondquarter 
surge in demand may have subsided a bit 
resler also noted that while us and european policymakers have 
been moving to head off inflation those in japan havent felt the 
need to do so 
even though the japanese economy is growing rapidly the bank 
of japan has given no hint that it intends to raise its discount 
rate 
the 05 percent increase reported for the japanese consumer 
price index over the past year resler added serves as a 
reminder that there is nothing inherently inflationary about strong 
growth

energy futures prices finished sharply lower as 
traders continued to react negatively to reports of a worldwide oil 
glut 
on the new york mercantile exchange contracts for october 
delivery of west texas intermediate the benchmark us crude oil 
fell 29 cents per 42gallon barrel to close at 1479 friday other 
contract months also dropped 
analysts said the nearmonth contracts for crude oil slid to 
sevenweek lows friday breaking a key support level of 1510 a 
barrel and dragging other contract months down 
contracts for refined petroleum products also finished down 
sharply wholesale unleaded gasoline for october delivery fell 073 
cent to finish at 4398 cents a gallon contracts for other months 
also lost ground 
wholesale heating oil for october declined 058 cent to 4288 
cents a gallon while other contract months also declined 
analysts said the market eroded steadily all week after reports 
that some members of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries were continuing to ignore production quotas increasing 
the worlds oil supply and further weakening prices 
the market continued to fall under pressure primarily on news 
that opec is continuing to overproduce said richard redoglia a 
trader with merrill lynch energy futures the fact that the 
market reacted to new contract lows is not a good sign 
reports this week indicated that the united arab emirates and 
iraq are exceeding their opec quotas by several million barrels a 
day 
analysts said that uncertaintly over the outcome of this weeks 
talks among opec secretarygeneral subroto and several opec members 
over cutting production also pushed the market down 
what weighed on the market were failure of subroto to secure 
an agreement between iran and iraq to share equal quotas and two 
reports of contintued high opec production and no sign of a 
cutback in september said andrew lebow senior broker and 
analyst at edampf man international futures inc 
some analysts said that fridays higher us unemployment 
figures indicating a possible economic slowdown also affected the 
oil markets

a setback for job seekers was good news for 
investors as a rise in the unemployment rate eased inflation fears 
and sent stock and bond prices sharply higher 
the labor departments report friday of a rise in the civilian 
jobless rate to 56 percent in august stirred the biggest rise in 
the treasury bond and note market since oct 22 a few days after 
the stock market crash 
the higher jobless rate calmed a market that has been worried 
for months that the economy was growing too quickly and might go 
into an inflationary spiral 
its bad news i guess for job searchers but its not 
necessarily bad news for consumers in general said george 
iwanicki an associate economist for kidder peabody amp co 
stock prices leaped and the dow jones average of 30 industrial 
stocks rose 5228 points to 205459 its biggest increase since a 
7468point gain on may 31 
the rise of more than 50 points triggered a restriction on 
member firms use of computers for a form of program trading the 
restrictions were designed to avoid chaotic swings in stock prices 
while the overall treasury market had its biggest rise of 1988 
the treasurys closely watched 30year bond staged its 
secondbiggest rally of the year 
the price of the treasurys 30year bond rose 2590 per 1000 
face amount driving its yield down to 904 from 930 percent late 
thursday the only bigger rally of 1988 was a 2625 price increase 
on jan 15 after the government reported a big drop in the trade 
deficit 
the bond market is highly sensitive to inflation and takes 
weaker growth as good news when bond prices rose investors moved 
to the stock market in search of bargains 
in the long run a slight increase in joblessness could mean 
more stable prolonged growth said david bennett a market analyst 
at prudentialbache securities inc 
in spite of the uptick in the jobless rate from 54 percent in 
july and a 14year low of 53 percent in may the economy continues 
to be expanding and the nation is not far from full employment 
iwanicki said 
fundamentally the economy is quite strong said helen 
hotchkiss a senior economist at drexel burnham lambert inc 
analysts said the slight increase in the jobless level eases 
pressure on the federal reserve to move before the election to 
raise its discount rate which is the interest rate it charges on 
loans to member banks
