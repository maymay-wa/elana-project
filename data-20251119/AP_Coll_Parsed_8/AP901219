victor bisio doesnt consider himself a fanatic 
about music even if he does own some 10000 albums and 2500 
compact discs 
but when he buys cds he expects them to live up to their 
original slogan perfect sound forever no pops no hisses 
no scratches music that brings you right in the studio 
thats why bisios massive collection includes a credit slip 
good for three albums from columbia records the slip arrived last 
summer a few months after he had purchased cds of barbra 
streisands first three records 
there had been mention from columbia that they couldnt find 
the original tapes but they put out the cds anyway said bisio a 
recording engineer who lives in encino calif they were are the 
worst sounding cds i ever heard they were screechy and distorted 
when she hit the high notes it just shattered your speakers 
compact discs arrived in the mid1980s and pushed lps out of 
stores since then bisio and other collectors have spent long 
hours comparing notes and keeping the pressure on record companies 
phil cohen a florida collector who owns over 6000 records 
bought the cd of jimi hendrixs electric ladyland three times 
before he found a satisfactory copy background noise made some 
tracks on james taylors sweet baby james virtually 
unlistenable for another collector 
collectors blame cd problems on laziness and greed insisting 
records made from inferior tapes were rushed onto the market and 
that songs were shortened or eliminated to fit albums on single 
discs the record companies admit mistakes but say some problems 
were unavoidable in switching from lps to cds 
in the beginning at least for the people who were asked to 
handle it it took a little bit more understanding of technology 
than to just say pull this tape and have it mastered said 
bill levinson director of catalog development at polygram records 
we had a handful of records eric claptons 461 ocean 
boulevard that were just not done from correct tapes the 461 
record was bad enough that we put out a new one and i told people 
in the press that we had done it 
among the worst cds 
fleetwood macs rumours a multiplatinum record originally 
released in the mid1970s it was pressed by warner bros records a 
decade later from an old production tape and the result was a 
muffled badly distorted cd a dramatically improved version was 
later released 
the jefferson airplanes after bathing at baxters was 
released in such poor condition that rca records apologized 
remastered the tape and offered an exchange 
collectors also had complaints about albums by elton john simon 
and garfunkel boz scaggs jimmy buffett carly simon and yes 
harry chapins verities and balderdash come without the booklet 
of photos and lyrics that was included on the lp gordon 
lightfoots gords gold was minus a song available on the lp 
there are some companies where no one in the music department 
makes the decision levinson said someone at the managerial 
desk says these next six ones are for reissue because the 
computer says these are the ones to go maybe theyre good maybe 
theyre not 
artists are beginning to take an active interest john arrias 
streisands personal engineer put together remastered versions of 
her first three records which have not yet been released 
guitarist jimmy page was so unhappy with the condition of several 
led zeppelin cds released by atlantic records he went back to the 
studio and helped produce a box set the bee gees consulted with 
polygram on a recent anthology which collectors say is very good 
and columbia which received the most criticism from collectors 
started columbialegacy records this year legacy has already put 
out wellreceived box sets of blues great robert johnson and the 
byrds made with the assistance of former band member roger 
mcguinn 
rich bauer product manager of catalog reissues at legacy said 
he hoped the problems were behind them 
when you try to put together a package from a record thats 
2025 years old it can be difficult to do everything as well as it 
can be done he said there are some records that havent come 
out such as the first two jeff beck records because of problems 
finding the original tapes 
polygram one of the first companies to set up its own domestic 
plant for producing cds received the most praise from collectors 
rhino records is also well regarded especially since its an 
independent label and needs permission from other companies to 
acquire master tapes 
we put out a compilation of hits of the 1970s and it was 
difficult explained gary stewart vice president of aampr artist 
and repertoire at rhino major labels are very professional 
good to deal with but for independent sources we have a hard time 
tracking them down and making deals especially companies no longer 
in the music business 
cds are digitally mastered as opposed to analog for lps a 
concept first tested in france in the 1920s digital is thought to 
produce a cleaner sound with less noise and distortion than 
analog 
digital recordings also known as pcm or pulse code modulation 
were first demonstrated in the late 60s and became available to 
the general public in 1972 when denon released the mozart hunting 
suite by the smetana quartet 
pcm recordings were only available on vinyl and cassette until 
the 80s when they were issued in the form of a 5inch compact 
disc developed by sony and philips 
collectors have few complaints about new albums but records 
made more than 10 years ago create problems companies may have a 
hard time tracking down the original master and end up using a 
second or thirdgeneration tape also technology has advanced so 
rapidly that recreating sounds produced on old equipment can 
require drastic measures 
i recently completed several classical records released in the 
1950s and 1960s said dennis drake polygrams vice president of 
studio and technical operations to transfer this catalog to cd 
we had to reconstruct the original machines a tube tape recorder 
and tube console these machines playing back the masters gave us 
the exact sound of the original recordings 
collectors hope the worst is over 
pete howard publisher and editor of international cd exchange 
ice a monthly newsletter that reviews compact discs notes that 
letters he receives these days deal more with minor compliants 
song length lyrics etc 
still hard feelings remain collectors have asked record 
companies to drop the price of cds not made from the original 
masters and to label discs to inform the customer whether theyve 
been remastered from an earlier version 
but the sticker could mean different things said polygrams 
levinson the implication of remastering could mean the previous 
one was no good or the previous one might have been good and 
youre making it better 
i also wouldnt want to have to put it in the artwork all the 
time it costs more to do that than to do remastering its a 
tough issue of balancing information and consumer needs sometimes 
the consumer thinks he deserves more than we can give

army units throughout chile confined 
themselves to their barracks for six hours wednesday to protest 
news reports on an illegal savings and loan organization involving 
highranking officers 
government officials and politicians said the newly restored 
democracy in this nation of 13 million residents was not in danger 
and that the armys action was merely a military exercise no 
incidents were reported 
defense minister patricio rojas emerging for a meeting at 
president patricio aylwins private residence called the military 
protest a mobilization to test some coordination plans 
it was the first episode of military unrest since aylwins 
government took power nine months ago ending 16 year of harsh 
rule under gen augusto pinochet 
rojas said the army would issue a communique explaining the 
situation shortly 
earlier in the evening deputy foreign minister belisario velaso 
confirmed there was some unrest in army garrisons but added the 
situation is calm throughout the country 
rojas said the problem arose because someone was much too 
nervous he denied press reports that the government had demanded 
the resignation of pinochet the army commander and former military 
president 
rojas said the government fully respects the constitutional 
clause that allowed pinochet to remain army commander after handing 
over the presidency to aylwin an elected civilian 
the news broke as aylwin attended graduation ceremonies at the 
national police academy as he left the academy aylwin refused to 
talk to reporters 
jose antonio viera gallo president of the house of deputies 
the lower house of congress also confirmed the military action 
after talking to interior minister enrique krauss 
viera gallo said public opinion can rest assured that 
democratic stability is strong and will continue to be so 
government chief spokesman enrique correa said the entire 
country is happy with the existence of a democratic government 
activity was intense at army headquarters wednesday night 
reporters saw scores of men entering headquarters many in 
plainclothes the men believed to be army personnel carried 
overnight bags 
no reports emerged of unrest among other armed branches 
the military in latin america has often confined itself to 
barracks as a means of expressing protest but the action is 
unusual here 
the chilean press has widely reported on the organization for 
weeks reports surfaced of unrest among army officers for what they 
see as a campaign aimed at smearing the army 
chiles private tv network megavision said army officers were 
holding private informal meetings to exchange views about 
media reports on the subject 
pinochet earlier wednesday angrily called the reports on the 
organization known as la cutufa press fabrications 
a special judge investigating the organization marcos 
libedinsky has indicted eight retired army officers for illegal 
financial operations among them was retired brig gen jaime 
lucares a former chief aide to pinochet when pinochet was 
president 
pinochet himself ordered an internal army probe of la cutufa 
which according to press reports that were not denied resulted in 
sanctions on at least 150 officers and noncommissioned officers 
many were discharged the reports said 
libedinsky said the indicted officers are charged with breaking 
the national banking law in specific taking money for deposit 
then paying interest which is forbidden for private citizens 
it is not clear where the name la cutufa comes from some press 
reports said it was the name of a dog owned by one of those 
involved 
the last time chiles military attempted something similar was 
in october 1969 when officers barricaded themselves at a santiago 
regiment demanding higher pay for the military 
in the bloody 1973 coup that brought pinochet to power and left 
elected president salvador allende dead there was no protest only 
full military action

forsaking internal divisions religious groups 
have begun to form powerful coalitions on issues ranging from 
apartheid to pornography the final part of a fourpart series 
unholy wars religion in public life explores the gulf between 
americans steady commitment to religion and its absence from many 
public policy debates

when nelson mandela visited new york city this summer more than 
100 religious leaders protestant jewish catholic muslim 
gathered to honor him 
the leaders who might not have stepped into the same room a few 
years earlier hammered out a statement within a halfhour 
condemning apartheid and supporting us sanctions against south 
africa 
it was stupendous said episcopal presiding bishop edmond 
browning 
burger king placed ads espousing family values in newspapers 
around the country in november after a coalition of more than 1600 
religious leaders called off a boycott of the company for 
sponsoring television programs they said featured sex profanity 
and antichristian stereotyping 
after a generation when they often were engaged in a holy war 
with one another religious groups have started to join forces in 
what some say is a culture war for the hearts and minds of a 
nation 
theres a growing feeling that the forces that are aligned 
against the christian churches secularism nationalism 
militarism are so formidable that we cant help but align 
ourselves with one another said bishop herbert chilstrom of the 
evangelical lutheran church in america 
the national council of churches has formed a group chaired by 
chilstrom to explore better relations among mainline protestants 
evangelical protestants and catholics 
by nearly any standard americans are among the most religious 
people in the world eightysix percent of the respondents to a 
november associated press poll conducted by the icr survey research 
group said religion is very important or fairly important in their 
lives sixtytwo percent said they had attended a religious service 
within the past month 
and 64 percent said they believe religion can answer all or most 
of todays problems 
the great public battle is over culture how ought we to 
live at the heart of culture are the moral questions said 
richard neuhaus director of the institute on religion and public 
life in new york at least in america for the overwhelming 
number of people the moral questions are inseparable from the 
religious questions 
but the force that historically tethered the country to a sense 
of the common good no longer is first among the nations political 
institutions as the french historian alexis de tocqueville 
referred to religion in his landmark study of american democracy in 
the 1800s 
after two decades in which individual liberty has been upheld as 
the greatest good anyone promoting an agenda of justice for all 
that would require a common ethical standard such as a moral 
obligation to assist the less fortunate is having a difficult 
time being heard observers say 
its doubly hard if youre religious your motives are 
suspect said philosopher lisa newton of fairfield university 
if i stand up and say i represent a religion not only are they 
going to ignore me but they are going to pelt me with tomatoes for 
doing something they believe is fundamentally wrong 
the buck has become the only common language said the rev 
donald wildmon whose american family association monitors 
television programming for christian leaders for responsible 
television the coalition that led the burger king boycott 
i think youre going to see a change in programming but its 
not one theyre going to make willingly wildmon said its not 
going to be something they want to do its going to be something 
they have to do 
some worry about the renewed activism of religious groups 
consider the sectarian violence in northern ireland india and 
the middle east and keeping religion at ars length is not such a 
bad idea those observers say 
paul kurtz a philosophy professor at the state university of 
new york at buffalo and copresident of the international humanist 
and ethical union said religious involvement in public debate can 
lead only to discord and conflict 
i think we ought to establish were a secular republic 
kurtz said 
but others see in the inexorable march toward individualism a 
tendency to ignore social ills such as poverty and homelessness 
arthur simon head of the christian hunger relief group bread 
for the world said the mushrooming need for churchrun soup 
kitchens and homeless shelters is indicative of an abdication of 
public responsibility 
theres been a diminishing sense of concern for the common 
good we have so elevated the value of individualism and liberty 
and freedom it has been detached from the sense of common good 
simon said 
there are some signs of change 
in reaction to a supreme court ruling this year a coalition 
ranging from the american civil liberties union to the national 
association of evangelicals is lobbying for legislation mandating 
that only a compelling state interest could be used to deny a 
religious practice rather than simply the fact the practice 
violates another law 
were in the midst of a culture war a battle over the moral 
values that are going to define our society said robert dugan 
public affairs director of the evangelicals association 
the stakes are high in a society that traditionally has depended 
on religion to supply a set of moral ground rules 
there is no secular rationality we can impose newton said 
in his travels throughout the nation tocqueville observed that 
religion is the one institution that can temper americans tendency 
toward selfishly pursuing their own ends 
more than a century and a half later the worst fears james 
madison envisioned in the federalist papers about the fragility of 
a democracy without a sense of public virtue are becoming a 
reality said harvard divinity school dean ronald f thiemann 
without any common or public virtue that holds us together as 
american people while that wont be the end of the american 
experiment that will be an unhappy resolve to the american 
experiment thiemann said it would just be a much less happy 
and a much less virtuous enterprise than the american experiment 
might have been

the associated press poll on religion was 
conducted by telephone nov 1620 among a random sample of 1006 
adults in the contiguous united states interviewing was done by 
icr survey research group of media pa 
the results were weighted to adjust for variations in the 
sample the poll has a 3point margin of sampling error meaning 
that 19 of 20 times its findings should be within 3 points of the 
result if every adult american were asked the same questions the 
error margin is larger for subgroups 
there are other sources of poential error in polls including 
the wording and order of questions 
here is how the questions related to this story were phrased 
because of rounding sums may not total 100 
how important would you say religion is in your life would you 
say it is very important 58 percent fairly important 28 
percent not very important 13 percent dont know or no answer 1 
percent 
have you attended any religious services within the last seven 
days yes 44 percent within the last 30 days yes 62 percent 
within the last year yes 80 percent cumulative results were 
compiled by asking followup questions to those who had not or 
didnt know if they had attended within the last week or month 
do you believe that religion can answer all or most of todays 
problems or that religion is largely oldfashioned and out of 
date religion can answer 64 percent religion is out of date 19

those cheerful green plants may be doing more 
than adding a touch of nature to your home or office some 
scientists think they are keeping you healthy by eating hazardous 
indoor air pollution 
wc wolverton a retired nasa researcher who now has his own 
lab in picayune miss said potted plants are amazingly efficient 
at eliminating such pollutant gases as formaldehyde benzene and 
trichloroethylene from the air 
i think we are closing in on the real economic solution to the 
indoor air pollution problem wolverton said in a telephone 
interview 
the nations florists and nurserymen are enthusiastic of 
course the associated landscape contractors of america has set up 
the foliage for clean air council to promote and publicize studies 
by wolverton and others 
a mississippi businessman wayne anderson established a company 
to market wolvertons invention natures filter which uses a 
fan to draw air through a plants root system apparently 
accelerating the pollutioneating effect 
weve done a lot of testing on it and it looks really good 
anderson said his alliance research and manufacturing corp plans 
to sell the plantbased filter through interior landscapers for 
130 
wolverton an environmental engineer said his studies show the 
fanaided plant filter can do the job of 100 normal plants in 
cleaning up gases given off by paints and varnishes particle board 
or synthetic carpet fibers or contained in tobacco smoke 
his work has focused on benzene formaldehyde and 
trichloroethylene all compounds found commonly in homes and 
offices and known to cause irritation and illness and possibly 
cancer he has used dwarf azaleas golden pothos bamboo palms 
english ivy pot mums and other plants 
the research began as part of the national aeronautic and space 
administrations effort to plan for air filtration in future space 
habitats where humans would be livng for years without any way to 
bring in fresh air 
not all experts in the field are sold on wolvertons findings 
im a wolverton skeptic said thad godish professor of 
natural resources at ball state university in muncie ind i 
think everybody should have plants in their houses but its highly 
improbably that theyll be useful for air cleaning 
godish published a study in 1988 critiquing some of wolvertons 
earlier research on spider plants and formaldehyde gas coming off 
particle board 
the small amount i saw just said theres no way in the world 
putting spider plants in the house is going to make a difference 
godish said 
wolverton said critics pointed out important gaps in his early 
studies but said his newest research answers any questions that 
have been raised 
our original work was limited he said those have been 
constructive criticisms 
wolverton said his most recent studies suggest that the 
cleansing process is more complicated than it first appeared 
at first we thought the plant leaves were doing all the 
work he said now we find the soil and microorganisms are 
major players 
there was some concern wolverton said that a plant exposed to 
nasty chemicals would absorb them for a while then just get 
sick and die and dump it back into the environment 
instead he said the plants seem to get better at filtering the 
pollutants the longer they are exposed 
as we keep exposing the plants they seem to absorb more and 
more rather than less and less he said 
a possible explanation he said is that the microorganisms in 
the potting soil adapt to the benzene formaldehyde or other 
chemicals they are exposed to and begin to thrive on them 
this is not surprising since it is a wellestablished fact 
that microorganisms have the ability to genetically adapt thereby 
increasing their ability to utilize toxic chemicals as a food 
source when continuously exposed to such chemicals wolverton 
wrote in a 1989 nasa study 
he said the people most likely to benefit from pollutioneating 
plants are those in energyefficient homes or offices tightly 
sealed to keep out cold air or in mobile homes usually made with 
materials that give off suspect gases 
plants wolverton said are probably the only economic 
solution to sealing these buildings for energy efficiency and to 
make them healthier

this is the first of a twopart series on us 
military personnel in the persian gulf dealing with what they 
believe their mission is about the second will examine the state 
of their morale 
equals 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
bournet huddleston says the 
persian gulf confrontation is about freedom although kuwait and 
saudi arabia arent democracies 
walter boomer jackie jones and others hope to right a wrong 
scott swindle and julie taylor figure its about oil 
jerome mcreynolds just wonders why 
a clear mission is essential to the success of any military 
operation but opinions about why they may be asked to fight vary 
widely among the thousands of gis in saudi arabia 
president bush has been at pains to explain the mission both to 
keep american troops informed and to hold together the polygot 
international coalition that has opposed iraq since it invaded 
kuwait on aug 2 
operation desert shield began at king fahds request to defend 
saudi arabia 
bush drew his line in the sand to protect the kingdom and 
the american interest in stable oil supplies to liberate kuwait 
and restore its emir check saddam hussein and free us hostages 
held by iraq 
since then there has been talk of destroying saddams military 
machine and his capacity for developing nuclear weapons forcing 
him from power and creating a new order in the middle east 
in november the united nations gave saddam until jan 15 to 
leave kuwait or face military action by that time the united 
states will have about 430000 soldiers in the persian gulf 
congressional opposition to the use of force has increased and 
bush said last month of the confusion over desert shields purpose 
if i havent done as clear a job as i might have on explaining 
this then ive got to do better because i know in my heart of 
hearts that what were doing is right 
if force proves necessary bush has pledged it will be an 
allout strike rather than the muddled incremental response of 
americas intervention in vietnam two decades ago 
this will not be another vietnam he declared this will 
not be a protracted drawnout war 
perhaps for most of the troops dug into the saudi sand the word 
from the commander in chief is enough 
i came over here because someone in authority told me to 
said lance cpl will french 24 of johnstown pa who serves with 
the 1st marine tank battalion ive got my questions but im not 
at liberty to say what they are 
bournet hollywood huddleston a marine lance corporal from 
los angeles said were all here to kick some ass lets free 
these people so we can go home and be free again 
generally the gis feel their reason for being in saudi arabia 
is to defend this islamic kingdom which has the worlds largest 
oil reserves about 255 billion barrels 
more than a few believe the whole gulf confrontation is about 
the price of gasoline and ensuring supplies of cheap oil for 
americans 
thousands of people are going to die if we go to war or if we 
get gassed said airman julie taylor 20 of lake tahoe calif 
i dont think a quart of valvoline is a good reason for it 
pfc scott swindle 20 of albany ore said i dont think 
its worth all our lives for oil and gas but its my job so ill 
do it swindle is with the 2nd battalion 7th marine regiment 
others feel the mission is to check saddams aggression and deny 
him nuclear and chemical weapons that threaten peace 
were here for more than just the price of a gallon of gas 
said master sgt jr kendall of the 82nd airborne division what 
were doing is going to chart the future of the world for the next 
100 years its better to deal with this guy now than five years 
from now one way or another hes got to be dealt with 
jackie jones a 25yearold army lieutenant from springfield 
va said the purpose is to show the rest of the world the united 
states is not going to stand for bullies trying to wipe other 
countries off the face of the earth if we let him get away with 
this who knows whats going to be next 
she serves with a patriot missile battery of the 18th airborne 
corps 
for some its a simple matter of right and wrong a feeling 
that runs from the top brass down through the ranks 
there are things worth fighting for said lt gen walter 
boomer 52 who commands the us marines in saudi arabia a 
world in which brutality and lawlessness are allowed to go 
unchecked isnt the kind of world were going to want to live in 
someones got to pay the price for freedom over here said 
lance cpl anthony uhler 20 of pontiac mich who serves with a 
marine light armored infantry company 
the reasons for fighting seem clearest among combat units 
closest to the kuwaiti border doubts are found more readily among 
those pulled from base offices to live in tents or the reservists 
and national guard members plucked from civilian life 
i actually dont know why were here said staff sgt jerome 
mcreynolds 39 of montgomery ala a national guardsman with the 
1241st postal unit

albert einstein called it the biggest blunder of 
his life but scientists said today that an idea he presented in 
1917 about the universe may have been right after all 
einstein came up with the cosmological constant to fix a 
problem his general relativity theory clashed with his belief that 
the size of the universe was unchanging 
the constant was a mathematical term that implied that the 
universe contains a repulsive force that acts against gravity when 
einstein added it to an equation describing his relativity theory 
the equation predicted a constantsize universe 
but scientists later showed that the universe was actually 
expanding the cosmological constant fell out of favor 
the late physicist george gamow in his autobiography my world 
line wrote that einstein told him that introducing the 
cosmological constant was the biggest blunder he ever made in his 
life 
but there might be something to it after all british scientists 
suggest in todays issue of the british journal nature 
george efstathiou william sutherland and steve maddox of the 
physics department at the university of oxford argue that the 
existence of the force represented by the cosmological constant 
would solve several problems with a standard theory about the 
universe it should be taken seriously they say 
the standard theory includes the big bang that gave birth to the 
universe and says that by far most of the mass in existence now is 
unobserved stuff called cold dark matter that would have a 
gravitational effect on the rest of the universe 
recent observations show more clustering of galaxies on very 
large scales than basic versions of the standard theory predict 
the new report says but the clustering could be accounted for by 
incorporating the force described by the cosmological constant into 
the standard theory the scientists propose 
their hypothesis suggests that the expansion of the universe was 
dominated by cold dark matter through perhaps the first onethird 
to onehalf of the history of the universe but that the 
cosmological constant force governs it now sutherland said in a 
telephone interview 
the hypothesis also accounts for the uniform intensity of the 
energy left over from the big bang and a number of distant 
galaxies that are difficult to fit into the volume of space 
allotted them by the standard theory sutherland said 
its still very speculative sutherland said i certainly 
would not like to claim that the cosmological constant is 
definitely there its a longshot but its a possiblity that we 
have to take seriously 
in a nature editorial theoretical astrophysicist edmund 
bertschinger of the massachusetts institute of technology said the 
new report may be the strongest case to date for a nonzero

still he said in an interview the new evidence would not

cosmological constant he said 
for einstein of course it comes too late

must be either expanding or contracting but he didnt trust the 
theory enough to do that

nehama beneliahu is one of the few israelis 
still willing to brave the hawkish trend in public opinion and turn 
out for street protests against military rule in the occupied 
territories 
but she also is lending her son money to buy a gun so that he 
feels safe from palestinians who could threaten his isolated farm 
near the west bank 
her situation illustrates the new dilemma of the doves in 
israel how to reconcile their calls for peace with the arabs with 
new fears of random attacks against jews 
the dilemma has been heightened by a recent rash of palestinian 
stabbing attacks on israelis and also by iraqi threats to attack 
the jewish state 
the result is that israels peace movement usually active in 
times of stress has grown unusually quiet 
there is a lot of confusion and worry we have tried to build 
bridges and now a volcano has come said aryeh eliav a leading 
activist in the leftofcenter labor party 
meetings between israeli and palestinian activists once common 
and public are now held either behind closed doors or not at all 
only 1000 activists attended a candlelight peace vigil staged 
outside prime minister yitzhak shamirs residence for the recent 
thirdyear anniversary of the palestinian uprising 
at the outset of the revolt such israeli peace protests 
routinely drew crowds exceeding 10000 but that was when 
consciences were guilty over soldiers shooting at youthful 
stonethrowing demonstrators 
now that the arabs are attacking israeli civilians sentiments 
are different 
earlier calls for jewisharab coexistence have been replaced by 
a new battle cry of separation recreating the old green line 
dividing israel from the west bank and gaza strip 
the persian gulf crisis also has undermined the peace movement 
leftists can no longer argue that the israelipalestinian conflict 
is at the heart of middle east instability and the palestinian 
question for the time being has been removed from the top of 
the united states agenda 
nobody wants to be active because they dont see where it will 
get them said nahum barnea a political analyst and leftleaning 
columnist for the yediot ahronoth daily 
public opinion surveys show israelis taking a hawkish turn 
pollster hanoch smith said a harsher attitude is permeating the 
entire societythe impact of the events is a tougher line he 
said in an interview 
at the same time however the growing violence is challenging 
rightwing beliefs that israel can annex the territories captured 
in the 1967 middle east war home to 17 million palestinians 
the effect in many cases has been an unexpected meeting of the 
minds between right and left on the need to separate the 
palestinian and jewish populations 
nowadays almost everyone left and right wants separation 
barnea said the jew has never so feared the lone arab working in 
his neighborhood 
the shared mood has legislators michael eitan of the rightwing 
likud bloc and gad yaacobi of leftleaning labor cooperating to 
draw up a plan for gradually separating the economies of the west 
bank and gaza strip from israel 
but yosef lapid a rightwinger noted in the daily maariv that 
a more common reaction to the violence is an allpervasive gloom 
despair has invaded israeli society it eats away at us he 
wrote 
hawks consider it pointless to press their arguments and the 
doves believe that whether consciously or not there is no chance 
for dialogue with the palestinians lapid added 
through the uncertainty the women in black a grassroots 
organization born with the uprising remains the most visible 
vestige of the peace movement in israel 
mrs beneliahu is a member she and several hundred women line 
up in downtown jerusalem and a dozen other towns every friday 
wearing black dresses and holding placards that read end the 
occupation 
the key to their survival says organizer anat hoffman is that 
they appeal to the majority of israelis who are sick of the 
occupation 
we arent standing up for the palestinians we say the 
occupation is bad because of what it does to us it costs us 2 
million a day and is morally disastrous mrs hoffman said 
mrs beneliahu 55 who was born in new york city and is a 
zoologist at jerusalems hebrew university started demonstrating 
for peace after her 19yearold son lost a leg in the 1973 middle 
east war 
the palestinian uprising only reinforces her feelings she says 
there is no question that unless we reach a political solution 
there will be an escalation in violence 
but being a pacifist isnt so simple these days she adds 
noting the money she is loaning another son for a pistol you 
see these are our needs today it shouldnt be this way we 
would all just have a better chance if there were peace

at success magazine an editors mistakes are 
costly 25 for a mispelling er misspelling another 25 for 
poorlyplaced hyphens a whopping 500 for getting somebodys name 
wrong 
for the past two months sloppy copy has meant surrendering cold 
cash at success gleefully plundering inattentive editors is editor 
in chief scott degarmo who says he grew tired of making the same 
complaints to the same people about the same errors 
when my people see a typo anyplace i want them to step on it 
like a roach degarmo said wednesday 
but taking money for mistakes isnt that a little extreme 
no if you asked the average guy on the street he would say 
of course an editor should know how to spell degarmo said if 
a bricklayer made a crooked wall or an accountant couldnt add 
people would be angry but editors think its nothing to not know 
how to spell 
the walletlightening approach to achieving good grammar began 
nov 5 at the monthly magazine when degarmo fired off a memo to 
his six senior editors errors would no longer be tolerated fines 
would be levied 
degarmo in the course of his job would check all copy handed 
in by his senior editors if he caught any grammatical or 
typographical errors the person responsible would pay 25 for 
spelling mistakes the same for hyphens after words ending in ly 
highlysought for example 
the fines would come from the money budgeted for their raises 
the editors they were appalled and astounded degarmo 
recalled but all the socalled positive reinforcement hadnt 
worked 
how serious was degarmo ask senior editor michael maren who 
had a 600 lesson in how to spell epitaph guerrilla and 
prestigious among other words 
after watching degarmo take a big bite of his money maren was 
apologetic 
we probably didnt check things as carefully as we should 
have he told the wall street journal 
degarmos approach has paid off in more than one way in 
addition to collecting 625 he has not seen a glitch in copy since 
nov 29 
its not enough to ask people to do their best degarmo 
said youve got to tell them what you want in my case it was 
perfection

black anger erupted into violence four 
times in the last decade but now black lawyers are leading a 
quiet riot an economic boycott that is costing millions of 
tourist dollars 
the activists were aggrieved by local governments handling of 
antiapartheid leader nelson mandelas visit in june 
instead of enthusiastic welcomes and ceremonies mandela received 
elsewhere on his us visit he got an official snub and criticism 
for refusal to repudiate staunch supporters fidel castro yasser 
arafat and moammar ghadhafi 
they have personal feelings but that has nothing to do with 
their official duties boycott organizer ht smith said of 
miamiarea officials 
under the name boycott miami coalition for progress organizers 
asked groups with national conventions set for the area to go 
somewhere else 
the boycott was announced july 17 as of tuesday the greater 
miami convention and visitors bureau reported eleven groups had 
canceled their gatherings some as far in the future as 1993 
costing nearly 55 million 
other estimates have ranged as high as 12 million 
organizers want four things an apology from area mayors for the 
mandela snub greater business and employment opportunities for 
black citizens a review of federal immigration policy regarding 
haitians who routinely are detained and deported while hispanics 
are admitted to this country and a federal investigation of the 
miami polices violent breakup of a july protest by haitians 
boycott organizers prepared a video comparing miami to selma 
ala notorious symbol of discrimination and police violence now 
they have their sights set on the national football league in 
hopes of chasing off the 1993 super bowl 
at first local officials seemed to ignore the boycott 
but as the conventions continued to leave and nonblack 
groups such as the national organization for women and the 
american civil liberties union joined in worried community 
leaders began to speak up and say they were sorry for the way 
mandela had been treated 
miami mayor xavier suarez who had joined four other 
cubanamerican area mayors in signing a letter critical of mandela 
issued a statement dec 12 expressing regret for pain felt by 
members of the black community but suarez did not apologize in a 
statement also watched carefully by his citys dominant 
cubanamerican constituency 
the tourism industry feels helpless said conventions bureau 
spokesman mayco villafana 
we feel we have been held as victims since some of the demands 
are political in nature villafana said only the entire 
community working can solve them or resolve this 
black support of the effort has not been monolithic the 
national urban league whose miami president opposes the boycott 
went ahead with its threeday gathering pickets greeted them at 
their hotel dec 12 
critics said coerced apologies would be meaningless but smith 
disagreed as an example he spoke of the unwilling apologies 
children give under orders from their parents 
the object is not their sincerity but to have them subjugate 
their ego and recognize the personhood of whomever theyve 
disrespected smith said 
and organizers also discounted claims that the boycott was 
costing the jobs of minimumwage black laborers 
you dont hear black folks saying oh woe is me because 
theyre not the ones losing the money said rev victor curry 
maria devalle spokeswoman for the hotelmotelrestaurant and 
high rise employees local 355 of the aflcio said she had not 
heard of any jobs threatened or lost 
we would love to get the business back thats for sure 
said jeff abbaticchio spokesman for doral resorts in florida 
which owns an oceanfront hotel in miami beach and a resort on the 
outskirts of miami 
he said the hotels were trying to make up the lost business by 
courting european and japanese travelers as well as ordinary 
nonconvention tourists 
the bad publicity i think thats what hurts us most 
abbaticchio said

the swiss alps are riddled with 
underground military bases but apparently none like the top secret 
installation on the edge of this plush resort 
deep inside mt horneggli men and women were trained to become 
the nucleus of a swiss resistance force to fight foreign occupiers 
the facility was ordered shut down after its existence was 
revealed last month but the political furor continues 
a camouflaged gate opened into a 100yardlong tunnel lined with 
13 rooms where the wouldbe guerrillas nicknamed the swiss 
rambos lived learned and practiced combat shooting in classes 
of 20 each 
at least one member was a highranking defense ministry 
official and others served in the swiss militia army 
swiss officials have denied the commandos had any links with 
gladio the recently uncovered paramilitary network in nato 
countries set up to fight a potential soviet invasion switzerland 
is neutral 
word of the 400member unit codenamed p26 and a parallel and 
equally secret intelligence unit p27 came to light in a 
parliamentary inquiry last month 
the parliamentary commission concluded that p26 and p27 were 
financed through the swiss army but operated without any 
supervision from civilian authorities 
the government branded both units vestiges of the cold war 
and ordered them disbanded 
the disclosures brought unwanted attention to the swiss militia 
army a year after a national referendum showed considerable public 
sentiment one of every three voters for abolishing it 
ursula mauch a social democratic member of parliament said the 
inquiry revealed only the tip of the iceberg 
these rambos swissstyle were to defend a democracy which 
they didnt think much of she said in a parliamentary debate on 
p26 last week its like ordering a wild dog to guard a 
sausage 
defense minister kaspar villiger rejected as absurd allegations 
that p26 could have been used in a military coup but he admitted 
he had little information on the unit 
the parliamentary inquiry discovered that villigers chief 
spokesman hansrudolf strasser held a key post in p26 strasser 
was then suspended from this job for failing to inform his superior 
of his double life 
the parliamentary committee found that ferdinand jakob knecht a 
construction engineer headed p27 and bernhard wehrli the 
president of the swiss association for environmental protection 
served as an aide 
public attention focused on efrem cattelan 59 a lawyer and 
reserve colonel who quit his job as insurance executive in 1979 to 
head p26 at an annual salary of 160000 
cattelan directed training at the gstaad underground center 
only a few minutes walk from elizabeth taylors luxurious chalet 
the resort homes of other celebrities like violinist yehudi 
menuhin and actor roger moore are also close by 
cattelan said he was never one for spy thrillers 
i once tried to read a john le carre novel but then put it 
aside after about 40 pages never touching it again i felt it was 
too complicated 
cattelan said p26 cooperated with unidentified british contacts 
but he denied it had any links to gladio units in nato countries 
the british have great experience dating from colonialist 
times he explained to an interviewer just think of lawrence 
of arabia 
most of the p26 members including about 20 women were in 
their 40s or even older according to cattelan 
these were people who were ready to be tortured or killed and 
to risk reprisals against their family said lt gen heinz 
haesler the armys chief of staff defending p26 against the 
widespread criticism 
the unit was supposed to expand into a network of independently 
operating sabotage and resistance groups in case of an invasion 
members knew each other only by code names 
the independent bern newspaper der bund suggested that life at 
the unit was rather mundane 
there was no uprising being plotted there were no agents a la 
james bond at work and there were no silent killings 
p26 was comprised mainly persons of advanced age who had to 
sign a contract were insured against accidents and received 
official per diems it said

kenneth weiner said he liked working in the 
shadows as the detroit police departments resident security 
expert a selfstyled cloakanddagger man 
but when it came to his other job as a commodities investor 
weiner was more out in the open and liked to drop names 
especially that of mayor coleman a young according to the 
government and dozens of weiners exclients 
during the past two months youngs name has been invoked in the 
federal courtroom where prosecutors are trying to prove that weiner 
and two codefendants skimmed millions of dollars invested with 
them from 198386 
the mayor of the nations ninthlargest city has never been 
indicted or charged with a crime but young has cited the fifth 
amendment against selfincrimination in refusing to testify in the 
tax and fraud trial of weiner his onetime business partner and 
son of his former stockbroker 
weiner steel broker alvin gendelman and radiologist steven 
lewin are being tried on 36 counts of wire and tax fraud the trial 
is expected to continue into next year 
before weiner began testifying dec 6 nearly 60 investors told 
the court they lost money in what the government claims was an 
illicit pyramid scheme 
some have testified that weiners comsec corp founded in 1980 
and dissolved by the state in 1985 for failing to file annual 
reports lured their money in part because weiner played up his 
connections with young and police chief william hart 
weiner gendelman and lewin returned more than 13 million to 
investors during 198386 but pocketed 4 million on which they paid 
no taxes an internal revenue service investigator testified in 
late november 
prosecutors say weiner sought to save himself by turning on 
young offering to secretly record conversations with the mayor 
for the fbi thirtynine such tapes were made from february to may 
1987 at the mayors residence but they produced only speculative 
evidence against young 
several months later weiner struck a deal with the irs 
recording 40 conversations with young those tapes like those made 
for the fbi apparently failed to incriminate the mayor 
as the police departments civilian deputy chief and security 
specialist from 1979 to 1986 weiner met with antiterrorism 
experts and added hightech security systems to the citys water 
system and mayors residence 
while weiner is on trial a federal grand jury has been 
investigating allegations of police department corruption 
no one has been indicted in that investigation focusing on the 
alleged theft of more than 1 million from an undercover police 
fund weiner has been publicly accused by the police chief of 
looting the fund 
weiner told investigators that young and hart helped him take 
the money from the fund according to an fbi memo obtained by the 
detroit news 
young and hart have denied any wrongdoing they refused to 
comment about the memo the newspaper reported tuesday 
under questioning by us attorney sheldon light weiner 
brusquely denied earlier statements he gave the fbi indicating the 
money went to allegedly fake corporations he set up with youngs 
blessing 
weiner stated that all the money from the secret service fund 
which went to companies established by him was for his sole use 
and not for any type of contract work for any type of security 
project according to a transcript of a may 1990 interview by the 
fbi 
weiner told light his security and consulting firms received 
money from the fund for any and all expenses all travel time 
equipment for any project assigned me by the mayor anywhere i 
had to go 
he also denied telling the fbi that in 1986 young suggested 
propping up the failing comsec by having weiner become a detroit 
police department consultant and any money weiner needed he could 
get from the detroit police department 
pressed to explain those and other discrepancies in his 
testimony and his earlier statements to investigators the tone of 
weiners testimony turned in a weeks time from selfassured to 
plaintive 
ive done my best to tell the truth he told richard lustig 
lewins attorney i learned how to lie when i went to work for 
the government

at the new england brewing co in connecticut the holiday 
spirit flows this season in flavors of cinnamon nutmeg cardamom 
and vanilla this is the stuff of winter of eggnog fruitcake and 
cider 
but this is beer 
new englands 1990 holiday ale is one of an increasing number of 
special seasonal beers that are being cooked up at small breweries 
around the country 
scholars of suds can raise toasts this season with mugs of hoppy 
holidaze kris kringle our special ale celebration ale wassail 
christmas ale winterfest winter welcome winters tale just a 
few of the names given by brewers to their holiday offerings 
a lot of the small breweries a lot of the microbreweries are 
doing what brewers in europe have been doing for centuries and 
that is brewing different beers for the different seasons and the 
most special season is the winter said tom mccormick a 
specialty beer distributor in rocklin calif 
mccormick is carrying nine holiday brews this year and said his 
volume in winter beers has roughly doubled each year for the past 
several years 
theres really been an increase in awareness of microbreweries 
and specialty beers in general so its all part of that he 
said 
the holiday beers are usually stronger and fullerbodied than 
brewers usual offerings they typically are a deep reddishamber 
and are relatively high in alcohol content 
and increasingly they are brewed with spices including 
cinnamon orange peel ginger nutmeg and cloves 
the tradition beerophiles say goes back centuries the main 
flavoring ingredient in most beer now is hops a bitter vine but 
brewers once used whatever spice they had on hand 
philip markowski the brewer at new england brewing in norwalk 
conn traces the tradition to americas colonial days david 
edgar news editor of the new brewer magazine in denver said it 
goes back much further to pagan festivals at which they would 
brew a ritual ale 
so basically edgar said the tradition of a special 
winter festival beer has existed since before christ since before 
there was a christmas 
in the united states the modern tradition can be dated more 
accurately it goes back 16 years to the first holiday ale 
produced by the anchor brewing co of san francisco 
anchors first offerings were strong hoppy ales perfect for 
sipping in front of a fire on a cold winters night later the 
brewery began adding spices that gave the beers a delicately fruity 
smell and taste 
other early entrants on the holiday beer scene included the 
sierra nevada brewing co of chico calif which produces a bold 
unspiced celebration ale and the yakima brewing co of yakima 
wash which makes grants spiced ale 
once distributed only locally or regionally these beers are now 
in gourmet liquor shops and bars across the nation 
they have company in some imported holiday beers including aass 
winter lager from norway youngs winter ale from england and 
samichlaus from switzerland which claims to be the strongest lager 
in the world 
the giants of the beer industry have mostly ignored the holiday 
beer trend the small brewers say its simply too difficult for the 
major brewers to interrupt their production lines to make seasonal 
batches of beer 
one exception is the adolph coors co which has been marketing 
coors winterfest a fullbodied lager since 1986 the company 
wont release sales or production figures but spokesman todd 
appleman said the market for winterfest has been growing annually 
i think each year youre going to see it become a little more 
national a little more highprofile appleman said 
youll hear no such claim from grant johnston the brewer for 
the tiny marin brewing co in larkspur calif his hoppy holidaze 
winter beer won a gold medal at this years great american beer 
festival in colorado 
but fans of hoppy holidaze are lucky to find it on the other 
side of san francisco bay much less across the country this 
years entire production was 28 barrels each containing 31 gallons 
of pale spicy beer 
still johnston isnt complaining hes only worried about 
selling out 
we try to have it on hand through christmas and new years 
he said but i doubt well last that long 
after that its just like baseball theres always next year

the man who ignted a firestorm over minority 
scholarships is used to living dangerously he spent years 
prosecuting ku klux klansmen and other perpetrators of violent 
racial hate crimes 
but this time the peril was political and assistant education 
secretary michael l williams acknowledged tuesday that he was not 
prepared for it 
the 37yearold lawyer said last week that universities 
receiving federal money could not legally reserve scholarships for 
minorities and promptly created turmoil in the white house the 
civil rights community and the ranks of higher education 
politically naive williams called himself although he had 
served in 1988 as a domestic policy adviser to the bush campaign 
before his appointment to head the education departments civil 
rights office 
others had less charitable descriptions an outrage said 
ralph neas executive director of the 200member leadership 
conference on civil rights we dont find this helpful at all 
said david merkowitz spokesman for the american council on 
education an umbrella group of colleges and universities 
at the center of the storm is a black texan with a blueribbon 
resume solid conservative credentials and an equally solid record 
of fighting racial injustices 
williams is a midland texas native and childhood friend of 
president bushs son george his parents and his wife a pilot and 
mechanical engineer all attended historically black colleges 
he received three degrees from the university of california a 
ba a masters in public administration and a law degree and 
while he was there he challenged the school to admit more blacks by 
weighing socioeconomic factors as well as test scores 
williams resume also lists community involvement he was a big 
brother in midland and now he tutors elementary schoolchildren in 
reading 
then there is his career at the justice department where he 
served from 1984 to 1988 as a senior trial attorney in the civil 
rights division headed by william bradford reynolds 
he tried and won cases against north carolina klansmen who 
conspired to obtain stolen military weapons an idaho white 
supremacist who tried to drive black and interracial families from 
their homes a kentucky klansman who firebombed the home of a 
black family and law enforcement officers in alabama arizona 
north carolina and oklahoma who assaulted private citizens 
he went after them with a vengeance and was very successful 
said reynolds he was a very savvy lawyer a thoughtful 
levelheaded kind of guy who learned very quickly and did 
exceptionally well 
not on his resume but mentioned often by friends and 
associates is williams sense of humor reportedly as acute as 
eddie murphys another trademark is an everpresent pair of lizard 
cowboy boots he also collects plates one from every state in 
which hes tried a case 
awash in ambivalence last week over williams blanket ruling 
bush nevertheless defended the official as extraordinarily 
sensitive very intelligent even his political opponents are 
charitable 
i will not question mr williams integrity or his 
credentials said rep augustus hawkins dcalif who summoned 
williams to a hearing of his house education and labor committee to 
explore the scholarship issue 
hawkins echoing the views of many said he believes williams 
just merely issued an opinion which is based on what he perceived 
to be the administrations position 
that turned out not to be the case at least at the highest 
levels of the administration and williams announced tuesday that 
colleges could keep offering minorityonly scholarships if they 
used private money earmarked solely for that purpose 
a senior white house official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said williams was not ordered to change his mind 
we had a conversation in which we were exploring what could 
and couldnt be done under the regulations and michael was very 
cooperative very interested in finding what his full flexibilities 
were the official said i think he deserves credit for being 
able to come up with a solution 
williams himself rejected any suggestion that he had been 
manipulated by the administration either in his initial ruling or 
in softening it 
i havent been a lackey for anyone he declaed the 
position i took was a position i took because i thought it was 
right 
whether the current brouhaha will lead to stardom or oblivion is 
anyones guess in this town said reynolds i would not dare 
predict

seeking to avert unrest by members of 
the sandinistacontrolled army president violeta chamorro said 
tuesday that she was vetoing military cuts approved by lawmakers of 
her governing coalition 
mrs chamorro said cuts beyond those already negotiated with the 
leftist military leaders could raise politicalmilitary tensions 
which could have unforseeable results 
she earlier warned that the cuts approved last week by the 
92member national assembly could push the country into chaos and 
a bloodbath the military has already accepted a drastic cutback 
in a videotaped statement broadcast late tuesday mrs chamorro 
said she was sending the veto to the legislature it was not clear 
whether it arrived before lawmakers adjourned for the night 
the president said she was using a lineitem veto against the 
national assemblys 196 million cut in the military budget she 
offered a compromise 85 million reduction in her original 
proposal of 786 million 
either figure would be far below the 177 million budget she 
said the army had in 1990 or the 131 million that she said 
military leaders had proposed for the coming year 
she kept overall spending to roughly the legislatures total of 
4958 million by cutting money from the contingency fund and the 
finance ministry 
the 1990 military budget was the last passed by the sandinista 
government which waged a 10year battle against ussupported 
contra rebels mrs chamorro defeated the sandinistas in elections 
earlier this year and took office in april 
deputies debated the budget package late tuesday as government 
leaders lobbied lawmakers to change their vote and army leaders to 
accept some cuts as a compromise 
earlier tuesday about 150 recently retired military officers 
held a march in front of the assembly building to protest the 
budget cuts claiming up to 10000 officers would be fired if the 
assembly overrides mrs chamorros veto 
the demonstrators were among 5000 who retired under a generous 
program that has reduced the size of the armed forces from about 
100000 when mrs chamorro was inaugurated april 25 to less than 
29000 
but the retirement program would not cover officers fired 
because of budget cuts sandinista lawmakers say 
the 51 members of mrs chamorros 14party coalition and one 
independent legislator voted in favor of the larger military cuts 
last week if they stick together they would override mrs 
chamorros veto 
the 39 sandinista deputies dont have the majority needed to 
counter the progovernment bloc a budget needs 47 votes to pass 
under the plan opposed by mrs chamorro the 19 million taken 
from the military would be spread around to benefit 15 other 
ministries and government departments 
mrs chamorro has said that while she favors further reducing 
the armed forces we cant do it overnight 
i think this veto will serve so that the gentlemen deputies 
reconsider this matter in its true dimension and decide whether or 
not they will support mrs chamorro said minister of the 
presidency antonio lacayo 
lacayo last week also warned that drastic cuts in the armed 
forces budget would endanger the nations stability 
a final budget for 1991 must be approved by midnight thursday

cable televisions two comedy channels are 
ending the battle of the belly laugh merging into a single cable 
channel next year the companies said tuesday 
hbos the comedy channel and mtvs ha will become comedy tv 
over time the network will develop its own identity said 
frank j biondi president and chief executive of viacom 
international inc which owns ha and the mtv networks 
biondi spoke at a news conference with michael j fuchs 
chairman and ceo of home box office the worlds largest pay tv 
service 
comedy tv will begin early next year biondi and fuchs said 
with ha and the comedy channel continuing their separate 
operations in the interim 
no money changed hands in the deal the assets of each comedy 
channel will be transferred on jan 1 to the joint venture based 
in new york city and staffed by employees from both ha and the 
comedy channel 
a president for the new channel will be chosen from outside 
viacom and timewarner which owns hbo 
it has been tough sledding for both channels hbos channel was 
launched in november 1989 and mtvs ha on april 1 this year both 
made original shows but relied on reruns of offnetwork comedies 
to fill their 24hour schedules 
the two channels reached a total of 15 million households with 
hbos channel in 85 million homes and mtvs in 65 million but 
each rolled up big losses as high as 20 million a year 
they also had trouble getting channel space on already packed 
cable systems the ceos said the merger made economic sense 
the bottom is that it would have been very expensive for us to 
push on biondi said common sense just prevailed we were 
doing a very good job of standing each other up 
rumors of the merger had been circulating for months the deal 
was struck less than than a month after two proposed rival cable 
services devoted to law in court and american courtroom 
network said they would merge 
about 12 new cable services plan startups in coming months 
according to one estimate by erica gruen a cable analyst at 
saatchi amp saatchi advertising the hopefuls range from a 24hour 
talk show channel to the cowboy channel 
allsports espn serves the most cable homes 559 million 
followed by turners cable news network which serves 544 million

some of the 125000 reservists called to 
active duty for the persian gulf crisis may be away from their 
homes and jobs longer than they had imagined 
the defense department said tuesday it may ask congress for 
authority to keep noncombat reservists on active duty for a full 
year the current limit is six months 
pentagon spokesman pete williams said defense secretary dick 
cheney has made no final decision but probably would seek the extra 
authority after congress returns in late january 
noncombat reservists provide support such as medical care 
intelligence analysis aircraft maintenance truck driving water 
purification and legal assistance they account for about 110000 
of the reservists called up from all four services 
we would like to have from the congress the authority to 
extend both combat and noncombat reservists to the full 180 
days plus another 180 williams told reporters 
we dont need to have that authority in our hand right now 
because we just havent come to that time yet but i think as a 
general proposition it would be nice to have as much 
flexibility as we can in terms of dealing with the reserves he 
said 
congress already has authorized cheney to keep combat reservists 
on active duty for 360 days although the only such units activated 
so far three national guard combat brigades were called up for 
180day tours cheney probably will extend their tours by another 
180 days if they are deployed to the gulf 
williams said no decision has been made on whether to send the 
national guard combat brigades to saudi arabia or keep them in the 
united states as backups 
the first noncombat reserve units were called up in late 
august so some reservists have been scheduled to return to their 
civilian jobs and their homes in february 
williams said some reserve or national guard units may be needed 
for longer periods 
it may well be that there are units with unique capabilities 
oneofakind capabilities and when we hit the sixmonth period 
we need to decide whether we want to come back and ask congress 
to extend that he said 
in other developments related to troop deployments in operation 
desert shield 
the pentagon said 10000 us troops have arrived in the gulf 
area this week bringing to more than 270000 the number of 
american soldiers airmen sailors and marines in the region 
williams said iraq has added 10000 troops to its force in and 
around occupied kuwait bringing the total to 510000 the iraqis 
have about 4000 tanks 2500 armored personnel carriers and 
infantry fighting vehicles and 2700 artillery pieces the 
spokesman said 
the army said elements of the 7th corps artillery based at 
augsburg germany have begun deploying to the gulf in support of 
desert shield it also said elements of the 11th combat aviation 
brigade began deploying from illesheim germany 
the army ordered to active duty 636 army reserve members from 
alabama illinois indiana maryland massachusetts and 
pennsylvania for aviation and intelligence support

two years ago 16000 city workers traded 
pay raises and increases in benefits for a nolayoff clause now 
with the city facing collapse what looked like a soso deal to 
employees seems pretty good 
as new york and other cities in the northeast consider municipal 
layoffs by the thousands most nonuniformed workers in 
philadelphia know they wont be out in the cold they just dont 
know if there will be paychecks 
the cashstrapped city says it will go broke next week raising 
the possibility that paychecks for philadelphias 30000 employees 
could be held up 
in 1988 mayor w wilson goode and nonuniformed workers 
represented by two unions reached a fouryear agreement that capped 
health and welfare benefits delayed wage increases and offered 
early retirement to avoid 1400 layoffs 
in return goode agreed to no layoffs during the last two years 
starting this year 
james rawls a heavyequipment operator for the city water 
department and president of local 394 of the american federation of 
state county and municipal employees said tuesday he originally 
opposed the contract 
to me a fouryear contract is too long he said but 
after we passed it and the city got into this financial condition 
then we realized that it was a better deal 
the clause ensured labor peace for goodes second term but has 
cost him maneuverability during the financial crisis said dianne 
e reed local director of the pennsylvania economy league a 
government research group 
i would say it was a big concession on the part of the city 
she said 
before agreeing to the nolayoff deal goode had won a bitter 
20day garbage strike in 1986 by threatening to fire the trash 
haulers they later ended the strike without any significant 
contract gains 
former city controller joseph vignola said the nolayoff clause 
surrendered too much especially after goodes tough stance in the 
trash strike 
taking a strike of that length i think the city could have 
come away much stronger in its labormanagement negotiations he 
said 
the cash crisis blamed on sluggish tax revenues and rising 
labor costs threatens the city with a projected 2295 million 
budget shortfall for the current fiscal year and 278 million for 
the next 
the city is trying to sell 200 million in shortterm notes to 
banks and two pension funds 
that amount could help prevent paydays without paychecks but 
isnt likely to cover bills that have languished for months 
meanwhile there has been no talk of trying to break or 
circumvent the nolayoff provision 
a deals a deal said larry lyde a heavyequipment operator 
for the water department 
police and firefighters have no similar provisions in their 
contracts but are likely to be safe from layoffs because their 
services are considered essential 
despite looming paycheck fears lyde said he just tries to keep 
his mind on his work such as clearing out clogged drains after 
tuesdays morning rain 
its unfortunate whats happening with the money he said 
but the job still has to be done and the public still expects the 
job to be done well 
city officials have said if they cant meet an entire payroll 
they may issue partial payments in hopes of keeping people on the 
job managers have urged workers to keep working if their biweekly 
paychecks stop rawls said 
thats fine if you miss one pay he said after one pay a 
lot of people are going to have to start looking elsewhere for 
jobs

when romanians overthrew the communist 
dictatorship of nicolae ceausescu a year ago they expected help 
from abroad to quickly improve their low standard of living 
but western aid scaled back in recent months because of 
political repression in romania and harder times hitting the donor 
countries has had little effect on the widespread miseries of 
everyday life 
the aid was like a drop in the huge ocean of our needs said 
emanel cosmovici head of a bucharestbased international 
humanitarian aid organization 
officials hope romanias solid support for the west in the 
persian gulf crisis and government economic reform begun in 
november with the approval of the international monetary fund will 
restore the country to the wests good graces 
the hopes for a new marshall plan for eastern europe were 
initially fed by the flood of food medicine and energy aid that 
immediately followed the revolution 
a variety of western organizations such as world vision 
international project concern international caritas orphanages 
trust the french medecins du monde and medecins sans frontieres 
and the international red cross have set up programs throughout 
romania 
some governments also have helped germany donated 33 million 
worth of energy last year and is expected to do so again 
the united states has been the leading aid donor according to 
diplomatic sources us aid in 1990 included 500000 tons of feed 
grain 7500 tons of butter and more than 4 million in medical 
aid 
the european community is providing some heating and electricity 
in the dozens of orphanages nationwide that house an army of 
100000 orphaned and abandoned children the legacy of ceausescus 
policy to increase the population 
but conditions at most orphanages are still very poor and the 
infant mortality rate in romanian hospitals is still among the 
highest in europe at 30 per 1000 
half the deaths occur because of complications related to 
malnutrition said nicolae dirina head of bucharests budimex 
childrens hospital which received aid from caritas 
aid did not improve our situation he stressed the 
problems are nearly the same 
and the economic misery grows prices have doubled or tripled 
stores are empty industrial production is down 20 percent and the 
average monthly paycheck is worth only 20 on the black market 
under market reforms moneylosing state enterprises face 
bankruptcy and the government has said it will stop providing 
industry with cutrate energy by and large private homes are dark 
and cold 
the flow of aid slowed down halfway through 1990 because of 
fears of recession in the west and doubts over the new romanian 
leaderships sincerity about democracy and economic reform 
the united states froze nonhumanitarian aid to romania in 
midjune in response to the national salvation front governments 
methods in breaking up a 53day antigovernment sitin 
six people died in the crackdown and the national front was 
widely condemned for calling miners in from the provinces who beat 
opposition activists and journalists 
romanian officials hope their economic reform as well as support 
of the united states and its allies in opposing the iraqi invasion 
of kuwait will pay off 
premier petre roman welcomed this months european community 
decision to grant romania and neighboring bulgaria medical food 
and energy aid worth 343 million 
some aid officials believe the best solution to romanias ills 
is in retraining romanians 
dr barbara bascom manager of world visions romanian orphans 
social and education support project said economic problems are 
matched by the disaster with romanian professionals who had been 
deprived of any information from outside the country 
bascoms group has launched a 10 million project aimed 
partially at retraining nurses and doctors in relating to their 
patients she said the program would improve the lives of at least 
7500 romanian orphans 
at one bucharest orphanage 11yearold robert dragomir who was 
paralyzed from the waist down in a car accident was less 
ambitious he asked western reporters to bring him aid consisting 
simply of oranges and a television 
i have been here for six years and never got out to see 
anything he said

since being named its music director he will follow zubin mehta 
who resigned effective at the end of the present season 
the philharmonic which took part in selecting masur played for 
him with sweep and alertness the back of the avery fisher hall 
stage was filled with the majestic strains of the huge westminster 
symphonic choir 
texts are from the bible telling of the hebrew prophet elijah 
pitting god against baal who is called by his priests 
when god sends fire after baal didnt elijah has baals 
priests killed jezebel wants elijah killed and he flees to the 
wilderness but returns with gods protection finally he is taken 
to heaven in a fiery chariot 
baritone kevin mcmillan sang elijah he was the least loud of 
the four soloists but one could hear a fine voice a focused tone 
and his words very well the other three were good soprano edith 
wiens mezzo marietta simpson and tenor richard leech there were 
five other singers with small solo parts 
masur looks at home on the new york philharmonic podium nis 
body often swaying his left arm jutting out and back like a boxer 
he didnt use a baton 
the music and its performance were solid rising to heights of 
emotion at times at the end of the first half of the concert 
there was foot stamping along with applause to emphasize the 
audiences welcome to masur when masur left the stage he waved to 
the orchestra his welcome to them

were going into a christmas mode here 
president bush declared joyfully but conservatives are finding 
little to cheer about as the president prepares to head to camp 
david for the holidays 
bush is making rightwingers increasingly unhappy even their 
longtime envoy to the white house chief of staff john sununu is 
turning out to be no santa claus 
with bush absorbed in the persian gulf crisis sununu has been 
tending the store more and more and with a firm hand 
sununu has been involved in a series of decisions that have not 
exactly thrilled the republican partys right wing including 
fillig two cabinet vacancies with moderate republicans and an 
ungainly aboutface on the education department ruling on minority 
scholarships 
sununu is setting up the office to let be bush be bush hes 
not trying to move his own agenda forward hes not advancing the 
conservative agenda said conservative activist richard viguerie 
about the only christmas present bush could give conservatives 
that would prompt widespread cheer naming jack kemp as the new 
republican party chairman did not seem to be in the cards 
bush leaves the white house on friday and will stay at the 
presidential retreat in the catoctin mountains of maryland until 
new years day 
the president clearly winding down for the holidays told 
reporters tuesday no more questions no no no ive been too 
accessible here were going into a christmas mode here where i 
wont be doing as much of this kind of work 
but he leaves washington with many problems unsolved topping 
the agenda is the lack of progress toward a peaceful end to the 
persian gulf crisis 
he had planned to spend much of the time as always hunting for 
quail in beeville texas but because of the gulf crisis he decided 
to stay closer to the capital camp david is just a 25minute 
helicopter ride from the south lawn of the white house 
bush also must confront other problems when he returns the 
economy is slumping international trade talks have broken down 
and domestic spending will have to be slashed to the bone to 
comply with the recent budget agreement to finance military 
operations in the gulf and to account for lower revenues from 
business because of the recession 
bickering among republicans may seem the least of bushs 
immediate worries but it doesnt make his job any easier 
and some of the harshest criticism from conservatives is 
directed at sununu the gops right wing had already been annoyed 
with sununu for his role in bushs switch on taxes 
conservatives now are griping about bushs decision to bypass 
conservative candidates in picking two moderate republicans former 
gov lamar alexander of tennessee and rep lynn martin of illinois 
to be the secretaries of education and labor respectively 
alexander is a longtime friend of sununus and martin and 
sununu worked together in bushs 1988 campaign 
furthermore conservatives are grumbling about the 
administrations effective reversal also carried out by sununu 
of last weeks ruling by the education department against minority 
scholarship programs at publicly funded colleges and universities 
many conservatives supported the ruling although it created a 
storm among civil rights groups 
and in what might be the final straw the administration is 
even talking about jettisoning a proposal long dear to conservative 
hearts a cut in the capital gains tax rate 
bush said tuesday that while he still strongly supports a lower 
capital gains rate and thinks it would stimulate the economy 
rigid caps under this falls budget agreement will make it 
difficult to include in his new budget 
i havent given up my philosophical commitment but were 
faced with this practical problem he said 
viguerie who has been openly critical of bush said the 
president is not even giving us half a loaf hes giving us 
crumbs now 
if bush is reelected in 1992 he will never need 
conservatives again in his life and then it will be open 
warfare viguerie said 
a senior administration official who briefed white house 
reporters tuesday under ground rules guaranteeing anonymity was 
asked about the administrations latest trouble with conservatives 
we will continue to stay open to conservatives the official 
replied i think were developing an agenda that makes sense for 
the next couple of years and i think theyre very much a part of 
providing input

driven from power accused of corruption 
routinely derided by prominent politicians east germanys former 
communists have found yet another reason to circle the wagons 
the top lawmen from the 16 states that comprise the united 
germany will decide next month whether to seek to outlaw the party 
as an enemy of the constitution 
the interior ministers who run the justice systems in their 
states say they want to know whether the party violates laws 
against extremism that initially were devised to prevent a 
resurgence of nazism 
they agreed to meet in january and decide whether to begin the 
legal process that has been used to outlaw extremist groups in the 
past 
the former communists now called the party of democratic 
socialism denounced the move as scandalous they said they 
would in fact use the constitution to prevent such a probe from 
taking place 
well raise an objection with the supreme court said party 
board member klaus steinitz 
purged of many stalinists the party of democratic socialism 
says it espouses essentially what its name says and contends it is 
willing to work within the constitution 
it remains a distant third in popularity among eastern germans 
and won enough votes in the dec 2 national elections to seat 17 
lawmakers when the new united parliament convenes thursday in 
berlin 
the effort among the interior ministers hatched at a conference 
in dresden over the weekend is the latest move to kick the 
communists out of the new society 
since west germany swallowed east germany on oct 3 authorities 
have 
fired all of the top officers from the east german army because 
they were considered too close to the old regime 
arrested or tried to arrest top leaders on charges ranging from 
corruption to manslaughter former party chief erich honecker is 
holed up at a soviet military hospital outside berlin 
quickly accepted the resignation of lothar de maiziere from the 
cabinet of chancellor helmut kohl after it was alleged the former 
east german prime minister may have worked for the communist secret 
police 
staged a massive police raid on the former communists 
headquarters in a hunt for clues to absconded cash which was 
located after a party official allegedly transferred it to the 
soviet union 
arrested dozens of reputed spies for the former communist 
government 
likewise the new state governments in eastern germany have 
vowed to purge their bureaucracies of the old guard workers 
routinely complain that their factories are still run by 
communists 
in the past week students have staged several protests against 
the planned revamping of the socialist school system 
now the 16 interior ministers who run germanys law enforcement 
are entertaining the possibility of having the party banned 
at the interior ministers conference dietmar schlee of 
badenwuerttemberg state called for a quick and united 
clarification of the question of whether the pds is an enemy of the 
constitution 
bavarian interior minister edmund stoiber even said his state 
germanys largest would initiate its own secret surveillance of 
the party to dig up evidence unless the issue were decided by the 
end of january 
he said because the party is based on orthodox 
marxistleninist fundamentalism it should be classified as a 
constitutional enemy 
if the state governments ask for a probe the supreme court 
would have final say on whether the party is a threat to the 
constitution 
former west germany the laws of which now govern the united 
germany has outlawed neonazi groups but let a farright group and 
the small west german communist party run candidates for office

reports of lenders botching mortgage rate 
calculations sent homeowners scrambling to see if theyre being 
overcharged and left bankers wondering if theyre losing millions 
the controversy over adjustable rate mortgages loans with 
variable interest rates began when a former federal banking 
auditor estimated widespread errors in the loan portfolios of 
failed savings and loans in the midwest 
john geddes formerly with the federal savings and loan 
insurance corp estimated up to 35 percent of adjustablerate 
mortages nationwide were miscalculated and borrowers were 
overcharged 8 billion from 1979 to 1989 
there havent been any additional studies to confirm geddes 
statements officials were unclear how widespread the 
miscalculations may be 
clearly the portfolio that we were looking at is the smaller 
savings and loans in the midwest but whether the problem is 
broader than that i dont know said steve seelig director of 
the fdics division of liquidation 
an adjustablerate mortgage or arm has an interest rate that 
fluctuates according to a financial index such as the rise or fall 
of treasury bills 
errors may arise when a lender mistakenly uses the wrong index 
calculates the index at an improper time or lacks proper computer 
software to tabulate the mortgage 
geddes allegations in august 1989 sent shockwaves through the 
lending community at least four classaction lawsuits have been 
filed in indiana alleging savings and loans excessively 
overcharged borrowers 
the general accounting office the investigative arm of 
congress issued a report on the problem in october federal 
auditors now pay special attention to the loans when reviewing the 
financial records of banks credit unions and savings and loans 
said mitch rachlis senior economist for the gao 
meanwhile the federal financial institutions examination 
council an umbrella group of federal financial services 
regulators is coordinating an examination of banks savings and 
loans and credit unions which have adjustablerate mortgages in 
their portfolios 
the move by the council shows the federal government is taking 
the problem very seriously said fritz elmendorf spokesman for the 
consumer bankers association in arlington va 
so apparently are homeowners hsh associates a new jersey 
mortgage information service is marketing kits for borrowers to 
double check their mortgage calculations 
paul havemann hsh vice president said last week his office had 
gotten about 400 telephone calls in a couple of days and that 
would be a conservative guess 
attorney george plews of indianapolis said hes working with 
attorneys in 15 other states whose clients have problems with 
adjustablerate mortgages plews who filed the four classaction 
lawsuits in indiana said a typical loss ranges from 200 to 1400 
over the term of the loan 
our information is that this is not a new problem in the 
industry said plews the inaccuracies in the portfolio was 
relative common knowledge in the late 1980s among bank 
regulators 
plews said his review shows the problem afflicts banks as well 
as savings and loans 
its almost an accident the lawsuits right now are against the 
sampls he said 
the american bankers association disagreed saying the problem 
now appears to be confined to just savings and loans spokeswoman 
tara little said some lenders have reviewed their portfolios and 
found almost no errors 
industry officials said they were unaware of any consumers 
avoiding arms in light of the recent publicity 
some analysts say the bulk of the errors may even be in 
consumers favor others say the damage is evenly split 
the adjustablerate mortgage problem is more a problem of 
complexity as opposed to a problem of greed seelig said

farmers might wind up with a further cut in federal payments not 
more money agriculture secretary clayton yeutter warns 
last week in denver the board of directors of the national 
farmers union called on congress to reopen and rewrite parts of 
the fiveyear law passed this year 
the nfu directors said the 1990 law will devastate family 
farmers and rural areas unless changes are made 
yeutter told broadcasters tuesday in a telephone news conference 
that opening the farm bill would be a big mistake for everyone 
including the folks from the farmers union 
in the view of some critics a problem with the 1990 legislation 
is that it was subject to federal budgetcutting restraints this 
pared 135 billion from commodity program operations over five 
years 
one result was to reduce the amount of acreage eligible for 
direct subsidies or deficiency payments under annual crop 
programs critics say this will cut into farm income 
in my judgment us agriculture came out very well in the 
budget exercise when one considers the circumstances under which 
that bill was legislated yeutter said 
but he added there are still some folks in american 
agriculture who believe that the 26 billion in federal subsidies 
that was provided in 1986 ought to be the norm and that if they 
just make a strong enough appeal in washington that would still be 
possible 
that was a reference to the record 258 billion paid to farmers 
in fiscal 1986 under agriculture department commodity programs 
those payments since have declined to a fraction of that annual 
rate 
yeutter said he sees no chance whatsoever that congress 
would return to the agricultural spending levels of the past 
rather he predicted that if lawmakers reopen the farm bill debate 
the chances would be 5050 that spending would be cut not raised 
bob denman a national farmers union spokesman in washington 
said no one had suggested that commodity spending be boosted to 26 
billion a year over the five years of the law 
but the nfu does believe some parts of the law can be 
strengthened and adjusted to help protect family farmers more than 
the 1990 act does 
 
washington ap unless world trade talks get back on track 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter thinks the european community 
may suffer major political and economic damage for its refusal to 
compromise 
and if it comes to an agricultural trade war with the ec said 
yeutter the united states is prepared to fight 
negotiations among 107 nations in the socalled uruguay round of 
trade talks collapsed dec 7 in brussels after the ec refused to 
bend on us proposals on major farm trade issues including 
cutbacks in internal price supports and export subsidies 
the united states backed by australia brazil and other major 
exporters sought sharp reductions in subsidies while the 
12nation ec japan and south korea were against the plan 
efforts are being made to reconvene the talks in midjanuary 
but yeutter said further negotiations would have little chance 
unless the ec is prepared to change its hardline stance 
but yeutter told reporters tuesday he thinks some internal 
pressures are developing in favor of a reassessment of the ec 
position 
he said he was europe last week in the aftermath of the dec 7 
breakdown and found the community to be very embarrassed by what 
happened in brussels 
the community will probably not concede that publicly but the 
fact is they suffered a major geopolitical defeat in brussels with 
essentially all of the world leaving with dissatisfaction and 
disappointment in the ec position yeutter said 
a lot of folks in western europe are chagrined by the present 
status of the uruguay round and are concerned that the ec may 
bear the lions share of the blame for failure should it occur 
he said 
consequently he said a number of working level people in 
the ec are trying to reassess the blocs position in hopes the 
stalled talks can be rejuvenated but yeutter said he didnt know 
at this point whether this can translate into changes at the ecs 
leadership level 
im pessimistic about the potential outcome of the talks so 
long as the community maintains its present intransigent stance 
he said 
earlier in a telephone news conference with broadcasters 
yeutter he was not ready to tip off the ec what the united states 
might do if the uruguay round of talks fail completely 
i want them to be uncertain about what our response would be 
and a bit frightened by the potential he said so im not 
going to discuss publicly what the united states might do 
 
washington ap after a twomonth layoff the soviet union has 
bought a substantial quantity of us corn according to the 
agriculture department 
officials said tuesday that private exporting companies sold 
266500 metric tons to the soviets under terms of the current 
longterm supply agreement between the two countries no prices or 
other details were disclosed 
the pact including a threemonth extension expires dec 31 a 
new fiveyear agreement will begin at that time 
a metric ton of 2205 pounds is equivalent to 394 bushels of 
corn thus the 266500 tons would be about 105 million bushels 
corn prices have been averaging about 219 per bushel at the 
farm level according to usdas fiveday average thus the latest 
sale could have a farm value of about 23 million

big bens chimes which traditionally announce the 
queens christmas day message and ring in the new year might not 
make it onto bbc airwaves this time around seems the main bell has 
lost its distinctive bong 
a decision has yet to be made and some british broadcasting 
corp officials think it would be a big mistake depart from 
tradition by banning the bong this holiday season 
big bens bells have traditionally been used on bbc airwaves as 
a leadin to news bulletins but disappeared temporarily in march 
after cracks were found in the hammer arm of the 132yearold main 
bell that sounds the hours 
the original victorian hammer was removed and replaced with a 
new 15000 steel hammer 
but ever since the 13ton bell went back into service in august 
bbc executives have been unenthusiastic so much so that they have 
begun phasing the chimes out of regular broadcasts 
it just sounds wrong said simon schute the bbcs general 
manager of operations and engineering responsible for setting up 
microphones in the big ben belfry 334 steps above the street 
im no expert on bells but this one has a sort of curious 
start and finishes sounding sort of small and clattery it 
certainly doesnt sound rich and important anymore schute said 
britains independent television news has solved the problem by 
continuing to use a 1967 recording of big ben but bbc executives 
wont hear of it 
we shall either use the real thing or nothing at all said 
john breach presentation organizer of radio 4 the bbcs flagship 
domestic channel 
these are the chimes of big ben to play a recording would not 
be the same its not part of our tradition 
bbc radio 4 replaced the bong with pips the electronic signal 
of greenwich mean time to introduce its daily news at 6 pm and 
midnight and the weekend morning news 
we dont mix pips and bongs said breach listeners have 
missed big ben but the decision was made at a more senior level 
than myself that the sound quality wasnt as good as it used to be 
and the switch to pips was permanent 
breach said listeners understood the reason for the change but 
bbc executives fear the public may not be so patient with a change 
in a holiday tradition that dates back to midnight dec 31 1923 
every year since then the live sounds from big ben have rung in 
the new year and introduced the monarchs speech on christmas day 
were still trying to decide what to do i believe we will 
decide to use the bell after all what is more important 
tradition or a faulty bong said breach 
bbc engineers have experimented with moving the microphones 
which transmit the live bong they tried placing directional 
microphones on a nearby building in parliament square nothing 
worked 
david heathcoatamory the former junior environment minister 
told parliament in october that the new bearings were to blame and 
they would just take time to settle in

women who have had silicone breast implants 
seem to agree on one thing that people considering this procedure 
need more information and the implants themselves need better 
safety testing 
a panel of women told of their experiences with implants before 
a house subcommittee tuesday urging action that ranged from a 
moratorium on the sale of implants to an appeal to keep options 
open for women who want their breasts reconstructed after cancer 
surgery 
sybil niden goldrich of beverly hills calif said the two sets 
of implants she had have left her with a silicone sword of 
damocles hanging over my head 
ive gone seven years without a recurrence of breast cancer 
but what will happen from the silicone she said at the house 
government operations human resources subcommittee hearing i 
shudder when i think about it 
the first implants left her with a body rash pain fever 
rockhard breasts and gynecological problems they were 
replaced with another set but the problems continued these 
implants were removed also and she had her breasts reconstructed 
in a different procedure using her own body tissue 
her gynecological problems continued and she had a hysterectomy 
two years ago a biopsy of her liver at the time identified 
silicone she said 
i encourage you to demand a moratorium on the sale of these 
products until we are absolutely certain that the safety of these 
implants can be proven beyond reasonable doubt she said 
silicone breast implants have been used since the early 1960s 
they have been placed in about 2 million american women and are 
implanted at the rate of about 130000 a year 
when 1976 amendments to the food drug and cosmetic act required 
regulation of medical devices breast implants were 
grandfathered into the market this meant they did not have to 
meet the specifications required of new products 
the food and drug administration has classified silicone 
implants as high risk but it has not yet finalized a regulation 
that would require manufacturers to submit safety data or remove 
their products from the market fda officials testified the rule 
would be made final in march 
rep ted weiss dny chairman of the subcommittee said he 
was concerned about the inordinate delay and seven years of 
the agency dragging its feet especially in light of the 
unanswered questions about silicone implants 
another implant recipient rosemary locke director of a womens 
breast cancer support program in the washington dc area gave the 
panel a different perspective 
locke who had a double mastectomy and reconstruction said she 
had some complications after surgery but explained that having my 
body restored eased away much of the trauma of breast cancer 
i have never regretted my decision even though i now know 
more about silicone implants than when i made my decision she 
said 
she urged the subcommittee and the fda as they consider breast 
implants please keep in mind the women who have lost breasts to 
cancer silicone implants may be their only option for surgically 
restoring their body 
dow corning corp one of the largest makers of silicone breast 
implants distributed a survey by the american society of plastic 
and reconstructive surgeons that found 92 percent of women with 
breast augmentation or reconstruction said they were satisfied with 
their implant surgery 
about 25 percent of silicone breast implants are for breast 
reconstruction after breast cancer surgery the rest are for breast 
enlargement 
the fda has received 2017 reports of adverse reactions from 
silicone implants said walter gundaker acting director of the 
fdas center for devices and radiological health 
about 3000 other such reports are from salinefilled breast 
implants which are less common than silicone ones however the 
saline implants also contain silicone 
witnesses at the hearing said these numbers were conservative 
because many physicians and surgeons do not report the problems

president bushs son neil was guilty of 
conflict of interest but should be allowed to accept a future 
position with a savings institution under certain restrictions an 
administrative law judge says 
the office of thrift supervision charged neil bush in january 
with conflict of interest in his role as a director of the failed 
silverado banking savings and loan association of denver 
administrative law judge daniel j davidson who found that bush 
exposed silverado to abnormal risk could have recommended that 
he be barred permanently from the banking and savings industries 
instead davidson proposed to ots director timothy ryan that 
bush be required to meet certain conditions if he again becomes a 
director or officer of a savings and loan or bank 
for example davidson said bush should be required to get 
advice from a lawyer on potential conflicts of interest if he takes 
such a position his recommendations made monday were announced 
late tuesday by ots 
davidsons proposals followed closely the recommendations of ots 
lawyers in the case against bush 35 an oil and gas developer 
davidson agreed with the ots attorneys that bushs failure to fully 
disclose his business ties involved a significant conflict of 
interest constituting an inherently unsafe or unsound practice 
silverados collapse in december 1988 is expected to cost 
taxpayers 1 billion 
in his recommendation davidson said bushs conduct was 
contrary to generally accepted standards of prudent operations 
and exposed silverado to abnormal risk 
ryan will review davidsons recommendation and is expected to 
make a final decision this spring agency officials said ryan 
could adopt the recommendation reject it or revise it ots 
spokesman tom mason said 
bushs attorney james nesland said his client would appeal 
ryans decision if it embraced davidsons proposal under 
administrative law bush would have the right to appeal the 
directors decision to a federal court 
president bush had no comment on the judges recommendation 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
davidson held a public administrative hearing in late september 
in denver at which neil bush and government witnesses testified 
the regulators accused bush of failing to adequately inform 
fellow silverado directors of his business ties with developers 
kenneth good and bill walters who invested in bushs oil company 
good and walters eventually defaulted on more than 132 million in 
loans from silverado 
bush has insisted that he committed no wrongdoing in voting as a 
director to approve loans to good and walters in addition bush 
told davidson in a legal brief submitted last month there is no 
likelihood that the alleged unsafe or unsound practices will 
continue 
if he again becomes an sampl or bank director davidson said bush 
should be required to abstain from voting on any proposals 
involving people or companies in which he has an interest 
bush also should make a full disclosure at least once a year of 
his business relationships with customers or potential customers of 
the sampl or bank davidson proposed he said the information should 
be updated each time there is a relevant change in bushs financial 
situation 
in addition to the governments conflict of interest case bush 
also faces a 200 million negligence lawsuit filed against him and 
other former silverado directors by the federal deposit insurance 
corp

the prestigious newsmagazine der spiegels cover 
story has a common theme these days in germany but an unaccustomed 
main actor one of spiegels own reporters is suspected of spying 
for communist east germany 
this weeks spiegel published monday spent 13 pages examining 
the allegations against diethelm schroeder that surfaced last week 
in a television expose 
the hamburgbased news weekly left schroeders name on the 
roster of its berlin bureau but noted he was on leave 
spiegel showed the drubbing it took from other german 
publications a headline in the masscirculation daily bild asked 
if schroeder was a traitor a cartoon republished from the 
rheinische post showed a spiegel sleuth following a spys tracks 
in a circle that became spiegels own trail 
i have to live with this story schroeder said in a 
telephone interview denying he had worked for the east german 
secret service or done anybody any harm 
spiegel called the denial a halfconfession 
the 60yearold native of eastern germany a military specialist 
who worked in the associated press germanlanguage service for 
five years in the sixties said his spiegel colleagues had 
explained that they had done major stories on other spy allegations 
and now we have to write a story about you 
i think its correct schroeder said adding with a laugh 
i would have had more fun if it was another story i think 
last week ard television named schroeder as having worked from 
1964 to 1987 for the stasi as the nowdefunct east germanys 
ministry for state security is called 
prosecutors confirmed that schroeder was under investigation 
though there was no word on how serious a case he might face 
conviction for passing state secrets can bring life in prison 
while a lesser charge of passing information to a foreign espionage 
agency carries a maximum 10year prison term 
as germany works to clear up the decades of crossborder spying 
prosecutors have already issued 61 arrest warrants this year 
spiegel which grew up with postwar west germany has been 
hitting the espionage issue hard along with other issues facing 
newly united germany 
only a week earlier spiegel had a scoop revealing evidence that 
east germanys first and only noncommunist prime minister lothar 
de maiziere had a stasi past de maiziere denies cooperating with 
secret police but quit as deputy head of the governing christian 
democratic union while prosecutors look into the evidence 
schroeder who remains free denies any wrongdoing telling 
spiegel he had had taken no money sent no written reports and hurt 
no one 
spiegels article wondered whether his denial might have been a 
halfconfession and asked through which activities was no 
one hurt 
doing the cover story was difficult said wolfram bickerich a 
senior editor in hamburg who had been friends with schroeder 
through working together 16 years 
but it was the only decision we could make because we said if 
we have such a case in our own house we are obliged to do this 
bickerich said in a telephone interview 
the cover story quoted schroeder as saying the allegations were 
a conspiracy against me or probably even against der spiegel 
it said three former stasi officials had revealed details about 
schroeders purported services for east german intelligence 
but the magazine cast doubt on the claim in the television 
program that schroeder had given the east germans valuable material 
on west german and nato defense planning and equipment 
the affable reporter was on close terms with the current nato 
secretarygeneral manfred woerner a former german defense 
minister schroeder was the first reporter to fly in a tornado 
fighterbomber he knew about scandals in west german officialdom 
schroeder came from the baltic coastal region that fell under 
soviet occupation and became east germany after world war ii he 
was trained as a journalist under the communist system but moved to 
west germany in 1956 his own story is that the soviet suppression 
of revolt in hungary caused him to abandon the east the allegation 
is that he was slipped into the west as a budding spy 
in his late 20s he worked for west german newspapers and then 
for aps german news service in frankfurt and bonn from 1960 to 
1965 
he was questioned in 1964 on suspicion of espionage against 
american forces schroeder read out a memo issued then to 
subscribers of aps germanlanguage service saying a reporter had 
been questioned his home and desk had been searched and he had 
been set free because the interrogation yielded no reason for his 
arrest 
the memo did not name the suspected reporter partly because he 
had relatives living under soviet occupation 
asked in the telephone interview if he had worked for the stasi 
schroeder said no the answer is no 
the questions directed to him he added were from former 
times not from the last 20 years 
in 1965 schroeder went to work for the bild newspaper in bonn 
and moved to spiegels bonn bureau in 1974 
spiegel quoted the chief federal prosecutor alexander von 
stahl as saying proceedings also were under way against two 
western german journalists other than schroeder

for five centuries spaniards emigrated to 
the four corners of the globe in search of new worlds gold or just 
a better life for their families 
today an economically solid democratic spain has become a 
magnet for new generations of immigrants fleeing poverty and 
deadend lives in countries from morocco to the philippines 
although the steady flow of immigrants over the past decade has 
not yet become overwhelming spanish officials are concerned about 
how the country will cope with the newcomers most of them illegal 
european economic community officials worry that spains loose 
border controls will encourage illegal aliens and help them pass 
into other western european countries 
they are part of europes greatest refugee migration since world 
war ii it became a tide sweeping from east to west after the 
communist regimes of the soviet bloc collapsed a year ago 
this week the government circulated copies of a report on 
immigration to opposition leaders prior to coming parliamentary 
debate 
the report proposes an annual quota on immigration tighter 
border controls and heavy fines for those employing illegal 
immigrants 
according to fernando puig de la bellacasa head of the interior 
ministrys domestic policy department immigration is a new 
phenomenon for spain 
we were an exporter of emigrants now were a country 
receiving immigrants he said were not used to it were not 
set up for it 
a year ago mulie jarju worked in a plaster factory as an 
illegal alien from west africa whose requests for work and 
residence permits were repeatedly denied by authorities 
today the 33yearold native of gambia is the star of a new 
spanish film about the lives of illegal african aliens and their 
encounters with racism and exploitation 
letters from alou won the top prize at the san sebastian 
film festival and jarju received the best actor award but he still 
cant get a residence and work permit 
the government of socialist prime minister felipe gonzalez 
passed an alien residence act in july 1985 it took effect the 
following may and gave all illegal residents 10 months to apply for 
legal residence and work permits only 38000 applied 
the number of aliens living legally in spain has jumped over the 
past decade from 181000 to 400000 according to interior ministry 
figures more than half are from other western european countries 
government estimates put the number of illegal aliens in spain 
a nation of 40 million at between 70000 and 140000 more than 
half are believed to be moroccan nongovernmental agencies dealing 
with immigrants and refugees say the total number is closer to half 
a million 
spains lightly monitored frontiers its physical proximity to 
north africa and its cultural ties with latin america have become 
issues in the 12nation ec 
in march spain will require visas for nationals of morocco 
tunisia and algeria denmark will then be the only ec member that 
does not require visas for north african nationals 
but ec countries north of spain still fear madrid will not be 
able to keep illegal immigrants from flooding into the rest of the 
community 
in a recent interview in the french daily le monde gonzalez 
said border controls were not sufficient to stem the tide of 
illegal immigration he also expressed particular sympathy for 
north africans 
if i were between 18 and 25 and lived on the other side of the 
mediterranean today with an income 10 times lower than the european 
minimum wage there would be no frontiers i would get by them 
all 
interior minister jose luis corcuera has expressed concern about 
signs of growing racism and xenophobia in spain a country with a 
historically tiny noneuropean population 
other government officials are expressing concern privately over 
rapidly increasing immigration from eastern europe 
more than 1000 poles a week are arriving one said were 
extremely worried about the dimension this could take 
as a signatory of the 1951 geneva convention on refugees spain 
is obliged to receive foreigners who seek refuge for political 
reasons and see they are paid a stipend until their cases have been 
decided 
both government authorities and private relief agencies agree 
that most asylum seekers show up in spain for economic not 
political reasons 
but the snailpaced bureaucratic process of reviewing individual 
requests for asylum allows many immigrants to slip through the 
cracks and into the underground economy where they find jobs in 
construction garment sweatshops and in fields and orchards picking 
fruit and vegetables 
since the summer about 150 africans awaiting decisions on their 
asylum petitions have been sleeping in a madrid park or in 
abandoned buildings because no one will rent them rooms 
since coming to spain six years ago jarju has picked fruit 
carted junk sold trinkets and sewed shirts in an illegal 
sweatshop his experiences served as a basis for the film

the commission is 600000 in arrears on an agreement to pay

inc of miami and new york the commission has awarded the 
licensing group a contract enabling it to keep 85 percent of 
commissionrelated sales on tshirts and souvenirs 
bill rolen a knoxville tenn businessman who had made a 
proposal for the celebration said goudie introduced him to 
gonzalez as a friend who might be able to provide rolen with 
financing 
rolen said the two didnt do business because gonzalez wanted 
part ownership in rolens proposed venture it was to have been a 
renovation of a former worlds fair exposition hall in knoxville 
for the columbus celebration 
gonzalez did not return telephone calls to his home and office 
in miami goudie also couldnt be reached 
however the commissions deputy director jana joustra said 
goudies resignation from the nonsalaried parttime post was 
completely voluntary she said goudie got fed up with the 
problems the lack of financial support and the criticism he faced 
after spending a great deal of his own time on the project 
nobody appreciated it she said 
congress appropriates 212000 a year for the commission to pay 
part of the salaries and rent for the sixmember staff 
the congressional subcommittees investigation of the commission 
will continue said the panels chairman rep thomas sawyer

the nations first ban on pet 
breeding has become law and owners of show animals promise a 
dogfight to overturn it 
san mateo countys breeding ban which requires that most pets 
be spayed or neutered received final approval tuesday 
opponents campaigned for a lastminute reversal before the board 
of supervisors voted 31 in favor of the law designed to reduce the 
number of strays put to death in the county just south of san 
francisco 
under the law breeders who obtain permits would be able to 
continue furthering bloodlines but thats not enough for some show 
dog owners 
the whole thing is going to end up an enormous legal battle 
said susan clough of redwood city a show dog owner picketing with 
her dog loree 
the intent was never to go after any group of people but to 
rectify an untenable situation in which we kill 10000 pets a 
year said supervisor tom nolan author of the measure 
the ordinance bans breeding by private dog and cat owners for 
six months starting in july by 1992 only dogs and cats owned by 
professional and hobby breeders holding permits will be allowed to 
reproduce 
all other cats and dogs will have to be spayed or neutered 
violators face a 500 fine the cost of the permit and other 
details have not been worked out 
the ordinance affects only unincorporated areas amounting to 
about 10 percent of the countys population of 628000 it would 
not affect such cities as south san francisco redwood city san 
mateo and menlo park

portauprince haiti ap the apparent choice of a leftist 
priest as haitis first democratically elected president may be a 
historical phenomenon but is not a complete surprise 
the poor multitudes that voted for the rev jeanbertrand 
aristide on sunday have traditionally found haven and inspiration 
in churches 
in the 37yearold aristide believers saw a prophet who could 
end the political murders torture and corruption perpetrated by a 
series of repressive dictatorships 
even people who lack electricity managed to have a batteryrun 
radio to tune in to his sermons broadcast on catholic radio 
throughout this mountainous caribbean nation of 5 million 
roman catholicism voodoo and protestant missionaries have 
played key roles throughout the turbulent 186year history of 
haiti the worlds first black republic 
but in recent history politically oriented leftist offshoots of 
catholicism had perhaps the greatest popular influence 
such sects blossomed during the late 1970s when haiti was ruled 
by the duvalier family at the time hundreds of young priests 
nuns and layworkers moved away from the traditional church forming 
grassroots organizations in slums and among the peasantry 
opposition parties were banned and haitis bishops either 
praised the dictatorship or were silent 
the people were beginning to see their bishops as authority 
figures and beginning in some cases to associate that authority 
with the authority of the hated regime wrote amy wilentz in her 
book the rainy season 
the new religious movement was called the parish of the poor 
or little church and stemmed from liberation theology which 
advocates that the church become politically active to improve the 
lot of the poor 
liberation theology was rapidly spreading in latin america and 
its adherents in haiti were speaking out against the violence and 
overwhelming poverty the nations people were enduring under the 
duvaliers 
in 1983 pope john paul ii visited haiti and admonished the 
nations rulers boosting the efforts of the little church 
the duvalierist regime enforced by a private militia of thugs 
called the tonton macoutes began in 1957 with the rise to power of 
the late papa doc francois duvalier 
it ended after mass protests forced his son jeanclaude 
duvalier into exile in france in 1986 
the opposition to duvalier was expressed in these churches 
said jeanclaude bajeaux a widely respected human rights activist 
it was a place where fears and anger toward the macoutes could be 
expressed 
it was largely inside the yellow st jeanbosco church located 
on the edge of a slum that the young fiery and charismatic 
aristide berated the regime in biblical terms 
aristide was a priest who used the poetic words of the bible 
to speak out against duvalier said laennec hurbon a caribbean 
religion expert and author 
he was a moses whose mission was to save these people from the 
devils the devils being the macoutes said bajeaux 
ordained a salesian priest in 1982 aristide was given at the 
beginning the goahead by the conservative order to battle against 
duvalier but as his congregation grew larger the salesians backed 
off their support 
in their view he was leaning too much to the left said 
hurbon 
in 1988 he was expelled from the order for preaching class 
struggle 
the crime of which i stand accused of is the crime of 
preaching food for all people aristide wrote in his book in 
the parish of the poor 
that is what the salesians and the haitian bishops and the 
vatican call politics he wrote 
many conservatives interpret liberation theologians efforts to 
organize the poor as marxism and us officials have privately 
expressed fears that aristide could try to turn haiti into another 
cuba 
for their part holdovers of the duvalier regime have vowed to 
prevent an ultracommunist from taking power 
liberation theology has been misunderstood it is just reading 
exodus which tells the story of the emancipaton of jews said 
george price prime minister of belize and one of some 800 
observers for sundays elections 
former president jimmy carter a bornagain christian agreed 
carter who also monitored the elections said he respects their 
the social commitment 
aristide remains a priest but is barred from saying mass in 
public he has said he will renounce the priesthood if the vatican 
which has a policy against priests holding public office asks him 
to 
the title of priest is just a title jesus was not a priest 
he said last week i continue to preach the same truth without 
mass 
international and us observers predict he will win with more 
than 60 percent of the vote the vote count is expected to be 
complete by weeks end 
aristides popularity is not so much because he is a priest 
he had that something because there were other priests doing the 
same things but they didnt have his popularity said laennec 
he stood for change 
the roman catholicrun radio soleil where many of aristides 
sermons were broadcast was also his pulpit reaching thousands in 
the countryside who had no electricity or running water but owned 
batteryrun radios 
the radio was often shot at and forced off the air but along 
with radio haitiinter radio soleil was the only source of news 
that reported human rights violations and corruption

the opera house sported a huge pair of 
sunglasses for about an hour today put there clandestinely by the 
environmental group greenpeace to demonstrate concern about ozone 
depletion 
the inflatable sunglasses 70 feet wide by 20 feet high were 
placed across the largest of the buildings seven saillike roof 
peaks 
an acompanying banner read ozone depletion stop it or well 
go blind 
a portable generator inflated the glasses at about 630 am and 
they stayed in place for about an hour until police pulled the 
plug that made them visible to many of the commuters coming across 
the harbor in ferries 
greenpeace spokeswoman karla bell said the stunt was designed 
carefully to prevent any damage to the opera house the activists 
all were experienced climbers including two who have reached the 
top of mt everest 
all seven were arrested after rappelling down the opera house 
but were later released without charge 
scientists say they have found evidence of a hole in the ozone 
layer over antarctica that appears each year ozone filters out 
cancercausing ultraviolet radiation from the sun 
greenpeace is calling for a speedy phase out of 
chlorofluorocarbons manmade gases believed to cause the ozone 
layers depletion 
chloroflourocarbons are principally used in refrigeration and 
airconditioning and ms bell said there has not been enough 
movement to switch to safer alternatives 
australia is at the forefront of continuing ozone depletion 
which threatens our health and way of life ms ball said 
she contended that for every 1 percent of ozone depletion 
100000 people worldwide will lose their sight 
australia has the highest rate of skin cancer anywhere in the 
world continued ozone depletion will be responsible for a 
significant increase in these cancers

twentythree states have sued the only us 
manufacturer of a schizophrenia drug accusing the company of 
violating antitrust law in requiring patients to pay for expensive 
monitoring for side effects 
the lawsuits were filed in federal court here tuesday against 
sandoz pharmaceuticals corp of east hanover nj and caremark 
inc of lincolnshire ill which has an exclusive contract with 
sandoz to do the monitoring 
according to the lawsuits sandoz charges 172 a week or 8944 
a year for the drug clozaril and the blood monitoring in germany 
where the drug is not tied to other services patients pay 1666 
each year the lawsuits said 
removing this unlawful anticompetitive tie between the sale 
of clozaril and the monitoring package can improve the lives of 
thousands of people suffering from schizophrenia said minnesota 
attorney general hubert humphrey iii 
sandoz has said the monitoring is needed to check for a 
potentially fatal side effect agranulocytosis that reduces the 
level of infectionfighting white blood cells caremark vice 
president jim mieszala said the monitoring is fairly priced 
new york state attorney general robert abrams said the safety 
claims were merely camouflage for anticompetitive practices 
the issue in this case is simply whether sandoz or the 
patients own doctors should choose how to monitor their patients 
use of clozaril he said 
sandoz spokeswoman maria sweeney said the company is trying to 
reduce the drugs price 
the drug was approved by the food and drug administration last 
year and sandoz began marketing it in the united states in 
february 
the lawsuits seek a court order requiring sandoz to sell 
clozaril and its generic equivalent clozapine without the blood 
monitoring services end sandozs exclusive marketing rights and 
award damages to the states 
in addition to minnesota and new york attorneys general from 
the following states also sued california colorado connecticut 
florida iowa maine maryland massachusetts new hampshire new 
jersey north carolina ohio oregon pennsylvania tennessee 
texas utah virginia washington west virginia and wisconsin 
schizophrenia is a disorder often characterized by a distorted 
sense of reality delusions hallucinations personality 
fragmentation and bizarre behavior

a 53member business coalition is trying to 
energize americans to oppose toughened federal automobile fuel 
economy standards on grounds they would inhibit lifestyles 
it will limit what consumers can buy said greg dana vice 
president of the association of international automobile 
manufacturers 
the domestic and foreign auto industries organized the coalition 
for vehicle choice to demonstrate that the battle over fuel economy 
is not simply a fight between automakers and environmentalists 
said jeffrey b conley the coalitions executive director 
among the coalitions members are groups representing farmers 
iron and steel manufacturers electrical contractors police chiefs 
and cattlemen all recognize that a proposal to require newcar 
fleets to average 40 miles per gallon by the year 2001 could cost 
jobs and money conley said 
dan becker spokesman for the sierra club dismissed the 
coalition as a ploy to mask detroits predominant role in 
opposition to the tougher standards 
theyre wrong if they think a phony coalition is going to help 
them win becker said tuesday people recognize that fuel 
efficiency is the key to curbing global warming and freeing us from 
having to send troops to the middle east to fight for our energy 
security 
the issue will be debated next year in congress

fewer than onehalf percent of more than 
120000 recent drug tests in the aviation industry showed the 
presence of drugs says the federal aviation administration 
the tests were conducted among commercial aviation employees 
ranging from pilots to airport security screening personnel as well 
as people applying for such safety or security sensitive jobs the 
faa said 
an analysis of the 120642 tests showed drugs in 561 just 047 
percent of the total the faa said tuesday of the 561 345 were in 
preemployment tests and those people were not hired for sensitive 
jobs 
employees who tested positive were removed from sensitive 
positions the agency said 
john mazor spokesman for the air line pilots association said 
the analysis bore out what we have been saying all along that 
they were not going to find any significant amount of drug abuse by 
airline pilots 
we would hope that the government and industry would refocus 
their efforts away from heavyhanded methods mazor said 
some 538000 aviation industry employees are subject to drug 
testing before employment at random or periodically on the job 
after accidents and whenever there is reasonable cause to suspect 
drug abuse 
included are pilots mechanics flight attendants airport 
security screening personnel and aircraft dispatchers 
a breakdown of the test results that showed drug use among both 
applicants and employees revealed 18 pilots or other flight crew 
members 116 flight attendants 300 maintenance personnel 48 
aircraft dispatchers 41 security personnel five flight 
instructors and four private air traffic control personnel 
twentynine persons were not identified by job function 
of the positive tests 346 were attributed to marijuana use 196 
to cocaine 13 to opiates one to the use of pcp and 15 to 
amphetamine use those numbers add to more than 561 because of 
multiple drug use by some people tested

in what could be the first step toward a 
mass surrender of hundreds of drug traffickers a cocaine baron 
wanted in the united states on drug and murder charges has turned 
himself in under a leniency plan 
the program is aimed at ending a war between the government and 
the traffickers that has left hundreds of people dead 
fabio ochoa vasquez 33 the youngest of three brothers who help 
run the medellin cocaine cartel surrendered tuesday to a court 
official in a church south of medellin colombias second largest 
city officials said 
he was the first cartel leader to accept a government offer of 
no extradition and reduced prison sentences to drug traffickers who 
surrender 
us officials in their request for ochoas extradition say he 
once managed the cartels cocaine distribution network in miami 
they say ochoa is also accused of having ordered the 1986 murder of 
barry seal an informant for the us drug enforcement 
administration 
ochoas surrender came just one day after the government offered 
new enticements to drug barons who turn themselves in 
i hope this contributes in the best way to peace and 
understanding in colombia ochoa said referring to his surrender 
in a statement released by his family 
a prison official said ochoa was in good health and was being 
held in a jail in the medellin suburb of itaqui 
ochoa is taking advantage of two government decrees one issued 
on monday that prohibit extraditions and offer lenient judicial 
treatment to surrendering traffickers 
in late november the cartel said that between 200 and 300 drug 
traffickers were willing to surrender in return for legal 
guarantees 
in its decree monday the government granted the cartels 
demands for human rights safeguards and the preparation of heavily 
guarded jails 
jaime cordoba the attorney generals human rights coordinator 
said human rights delegates were being appointed to oversee ochoas 
surrender 
president cesar gaviria who took office in august told 
reporters he was pleased with the results of the decrees he issued 
in a bid to secure the surrender of leading traffickers 
the government is very satisfied that its decrees are having 
all the effects they should have in colombian life gaviria said 
speaking over the caracol radio network 
in the past month four midlevel traffickers have accepted 
gavirias offer and turned themselves in 
the decrees have exposed the president to intense criticism from 
foreign diplomats the press and local politicians who say the 
government is going soft in the drug war 
but the government insists its policies will lead cocaine 
traffickers to serve time in colombia instead of relying on us 
courts to prosecute colombian drug criminals 
in the past drug barons have threatened bribed or killed 
colombian judges and prison authorities to obtain their freedom 
we are sure that all of the traffickers will find it much 
easier to surrender than to continue a sterile fight that produces 
only pain and death justice minister jaime giraldo told 
reporters tuesday evening 
the medellin gang has been blamed for killing around 550 
colombians since the government and traffickers declared war on 
each other in august 1989 when a prominent presidential candidate 
was assassinated 
it was not clear if ochoas brothers jorge luis and juan david 
were also planning to turn themselves in the cartels top leader 
pablo escobar also remains at large 
fabio ochoas statement indicated that other drug kingpins may 
demand further guarantees before surrendering 
he said the recent decrees were a long way from satisfying the 
dreams and expectations raised by the government

a chinese student trying to ensure justice for a 
jailed prodemocracy activist left today for the united states 
ending a frustrating trip with no new information about his 
friends case 
ge xun 31 came to china after hearing reports that wang juntao 
would stand trial soon for his involvement in last years 
prodemocracy movement 
ge said he wanted to attend court proceedings to make sure wang 
was treated fairly but he was stonewalled by chinese officials 
and decided to cut short his trip after 10 days because of pressure 
from family members concerned about his safety 
i am not so satisfied with the trip probably i could do a 
little more by continuing here he said but i will follow the 
developments from the united states and write letters to chinese 
authorities to let them know people care about wang juntao 
chinese sources say wang and a colleague chen ziming have been 
charged with sedition a crime that could bring the death penalty 
wang was the editor of a nowbanned economic studies weekly and 
chen was the publisher 
they have been accused of manipulating students who led protests 
last year urging democratic reforms 
the chinese army violently suppressed the prodemocracy movement 
in june 1989 killing hundreds of people thousands were arrested 
in a nationwide crackdown on dissent that followed 
ge said he was sent from office to office and followed by 
undercover security agents when he tried to get information about 
wang 
finally i was told the case is still under investigation 
he said 
at the beijing public security bureau officials quizzed ge 
about his background 
they wanted to know why my friend is more important to me than 
my family ge said i told them my family is important to me 
but at least they are free 
ge said he asked public security officials if wang is still 
alive 
they got very upset about this he said they said his 
family members know about him and that it is not necessary to 
explain this to me 
trials in china are closed except to a few invited people who 
often do not include family or friends there is a presumption that 
the defendant would not have been arrested unless guilty 
defense lawyers usually confine their arguments to pleas for 
leniency based on the defendants lack of a criminal record or a 
good attitude sentences may be reduced if the defendant admits 
guilt 
ge who is working on a doctorate in physics at texas aampm 
university said he and wang became close friends after they met in 
1982 while working at the institute of atomic energy 
ge has been in the united states since 1986 and has not seen 
wang for five years 
he said he has not decided if he will come to china again to 
continue seeking justice for wang 
im going to watch the reports i just want to make sure 
everything is fair he said 
ge said he considered trying to discuss wangs case with richard 
schifter us assistant secretary of state for human rights 
schifter who met with chinese officials today and tuesdayk was 
expected to seek lenient treatment for people jailed following last 
years prodemocracy movement 
i think maybe his trip is too sensitive and i dont want to 
complicate things ge said

the former owner of nevadas most 
notorious legal bordello says the red light is back on at the 
mustang ranch but county commissioners arent so sure 
the storey county commission had planned tuesday to debate 
whether to let prostitution continue at the 104room brothel under 
new ownership when former owner joe conforte announced his permit 
for operating the place is still valid 
we reopened this morning conforte told the threemember 
panel im not here to ask for a license im here as a common 
courtesy to this board to tell you how it is 
the commission took no immediate action deciding to seek an 
opinion from the state attorney generals office on confortes 
status 
sheriff bob del carlo said prostitutes were moving back into the 
brothel on tuesday but could not begin work again until they had 
been tested for sexually transmitted disease and issued health 
cards by his office 
the internal revenue service had seized the ranch from conforte 
and sold it in november to recoup some 13 million in taxes owed by 
him and his wife under the new owner confortes lawyer peter 
perry conforte became general manager 
commission chairman larry prater said he felt conforte had lost 
his permit because of the sale 
but conforte said he paid the county 15000 for a quarterly 
license fee two weeks ago plus a 1500 late charge 
when the irs sold the 400acre ranch the county lost revenues 
from its 60000 annual license fee and a 2 percent tax on its 
rooms two commissioners indicated earlier this month that the

children with dangerously high cholesterol wont 
necessarily have the problem later in life scientists reported 
today in a study they said casts doubt on the need for cholesterol 
screening of all youngsters 
the authors of the study in the journal of the american medical 
association said univeral cholesterol screening for children would 
be expensive and would fail to pinpoint which adults will continue 
to show high cholesterol levels 
in another study in todays journal researchers said that 
cholesterolreducing drugs that help unclog mens coronary arteries 
and reduce their risk of heart attack do the same for women as 
well 
previous studies excluded women because men run a far higher 
risk of coronary problems at earlier ages cholesterol kills by 
clogging the blood vessels with lesions a combination of fatty 
deposits and scar tissue 
there are lots of other risk factors besides cholesterol but 
one of the most important risk factors is high cholesterol and 
reversal of atherosclerosis can reduce the chances of a heart 
attack dr mary malloy coauthor of the study said in a 
telephone interview tuesday 
the study loked at 41 women and 31 men with atherosclerosis 
over several years subjects took bile acidbinding resin and 
niacin daily which along with dietary changes reduced their 
cholesterol levels an average of 381 percent 
after 26 months coronary artery lesions shrank more than 2 
percent among 22 women enrolled in the treatment 
the 19 other women whose cholesterol levels were reduced an 
average of 106 percent through diet changes and lessintensive 
drug treatments showed an average increase of slightly more than 1 
percent in coronary artery lesions 
the treatments effect on men in the study showed the same 
trends but did not result in a statistically significant 
difference among men the study concluded 
dr david blankenhorn of the university of southern california 
who was not involved in the study said doctors are less likely to 
prescribe cholesterolreducing medicines for women because the 
evidence on their effectiveness wasnt in 
in the other study the cholesterol levels of 2367 children 
between the ages of 8 and 18 in muscatine iowa were examined and 
their cholesterol levels were again measured between the ages of 20 
and 30 
seventyfive percent of the females and 56 percent of the males 
with high cholesterol as children were under the levels described 
as dangerous by the national cholesterol education program when 
tested as adults the study found 
childhood cholesterol levels are a poor predictor of high 
cholesterol levels in young adulthood and will be an even poorer 
predictor of coronary heart disease later in life said the 
studys authors william r clarke and dr ronald lauer of the 
university of iowa

a columnist and tv commentator who reports on 
financial news says there is no ethical conflict between her work 
and her appointment to the mcdonalds corp board of directors 
this wont be a problem said terry savage who writes a 
weekly financial news column for the chicago suntimes and dallas 
times herald and who appears regularly on chicago station wbbm 
which is owned by cbs 
savage 46 the first woman named to the companys board in 20 
years will receive 24000 a year from mcdonalds plus 2000 for 
each board meeting attended 
officials at the newspapers and tv station said savage promised 
to stay away from any issues that could be construed as conflicting 
with her role on the mcdonalds board 
we will make sure she does not write about the food industry 
and mcdonalds in particular said times herald business editor 
jim frisinger but george harmon who teaches business writing at 
northwestern universitys graduate school of journalism said it 
would be hard to avoid the apperance of a conflict because 
mcdonalds influences so much of the business world 
he said savage could be restricted from reporting on the beef 
potato and recycling industries and even the stock market because 
mcdonalds is among the 30 companies whose performances are 
reflected in the dow jones industrials average 
if somebody wanted to restrict terry from reporting on 
mcdonalds and be very strict about that it would restrain her 
considerably he said

more than 1000 people a day are flocking 
to the back of an auto parts store past the spark plugs and fan 
belts to see what many believe is an image of the virgin mary on 
the bathroom floor 
each day as the multitudes arrive at progreso auto supply in 
this tiny mexican border town owner reynaldo trevino directs them 
to the spot in the concrete of the shower stall next to a toilet 
where thousands say they have seen the image of the mother of 
christ 
shes so beautiful so beautiful 14yearold bonnie 
maldonado said tuesday as tears streamed down her face 
the footwide image is in varying shades of gray that trevino 
said used to be one shade he said he first noticed it on dec 3 
i asked her why on the floor why the bathroom trevino 
said 
the 45yearold roman catholic said something within his heart 
told him to spread the message that the virgin marys presence on 
the floor symbolized the way many neglect their faith 
so i started telling every customer who came in he said 
before i sold them a part i took them back 
officials at the roman catholic archdiocese in brownsville have 
declined to comment on the image 
what could be interpreted as facial features are vaguely 
discernible in the markings others have said they see even more 
including an earring flowers and an angel to the side 
as word of the site has spread through the lower rio grande 
valley more than 1000 people a day have flocked to the store 
most come only to see the image and trevino said his auto parts 
business has suffered 
but he said he welcomes them all asking only that they leave no 
money or other offerings 
i dont want this to be commercialized or anything he said 
he also discourages the taking of photographs i want them to 
take the image home with them in their hearts he said 
many of those who come to the store kneel to pray some make the 
sign of the cross or touch the image 
ernestina maldonado 41 who lives in nearby weslaco said 
seeing the image filled her with pain 
we are in a very troubled world right now she said maybe 
its a sign for people to think about it and repent because its 
getting real ugly in the world

burmese dissidents who were elected 
seven months ago but kept from power by their countrys military 
rulers have announced the formation of a rival government 
headed by sein win the cousin of burmas detained opposition 
leader aung san suu kyi the group on tuesday announced an 
eightmember cabinet at manerplaw headquarters of ethnic karen 
insurgents near the thai border 
all eight men won parliamentary seats in the may 27 general 
election ms suu kyis national league for democracy won the 
election by a landslide the government has refused to accept 
western diplomats have said it was unlikely any country would 
recognize the parallel government and a powerful member of burmas 
military government said in a newspaper interview published tuesday 
that forming a rival government would be a great mistake 
sein win was named prime minister of the national coalition 
government of the union of burma he said in a speech that 
forming the body was the only option for us to choose because 
this military junta has no will and no way to transfer power to the 
people 
burma has become a country shrouded by darkness because of all 
the unlawful arrests tortures and persecutions and human rights 
violations a declaration issued by the new government said 
copies were made available in bangkok today 
the declaration said the government stood for the immediate 
elimination of the military government the calling of a national 
convention including members of the parliament and insurgent 
groups and the establishment of a genuine democratic 
government to create an independent prosperous and modernized 
federal union of burma 
it named eight people to a cabinet sein win peter lin pin win 
ko than kywe hla pe thein oo hla tint and tun oo 
sein win is a member of the national democracy party while 
peter lin pin was an independent candidate in the election the 
others are members of the national league for democracy 
all fled the threat of arrest in burma after their plans to form 
a rival government became known 
the democratic alliance of burma an umbrella organization of 21 
ethnic and other rebel groups fighting the central government 
backed the declaration the karen are members of the alliance 
which has its headquarters in manerplaw located along the frontier 
with thailand 120 miles northeast of rangoon 
the military took power by force in burma in 1988 
soldiers killed thousands of people who joined in a nationwide 
movement for democracy that year 
the government has since detained most leading members of the 
opposition these include ms suu kyi who was put under house 
arrest in july 1989 
amnesty international and other human rights groups have cited 
numerous reports of torture of dissidents by military agencies

the oklahoma supreme court upheld the 
landslide election of a dead judge against a living candidate 
saying the results must be interpreted as a vote against the loser 
incumbent frank m ogden iii who died aug 11 won 91 percent 
of the vote cast nov 6 in a race against josh l evans who had 
challenged the results 
it is beyond question that the will of the electorate was to 
cast votes for judge ogden and against candidate evans the 
supreme court said tuesday 
the result leaves the job open for an appointee of the governor 
evans 74 ran a campaign for the oklahoma panhandle judgeship 
that described him as an able lawyer and a living person 
the court said evans should have filed his challenge to the dead 
mans candidacy before the election

president bush disputes the notion that 
theres some kind of racism involved in the makeup of the us 
military force in the persian gulf 
i dont think this concept that this is a discriminatory army 
or an army that is discriminating and thus sending more blacks to 
the fate or minorities hispanics or something is proper bush 
told a group of regional reporters tuesday 
he was replying to a question that suggested a disproportionate 
number of the troops he has sent to the middle east are from 
minority or workingclass groups 
this is an allvolunteer army theyre not draftdodging 
the president said 
the situation was different during the vietnam war bush said 
the kid that got disproportionately there was the guy that 
couldnt get the draft exemption and came out of kind of the 
lower rungs of society he said this is different 
critics say that although the draft was abolished 17 years ago 
the volunteer armed forces are composed disproportionately of 
minorities and the poor who join because they see the military as a 
way to get the education and job that they might not otherwise 
attain 
on another matter bush said he still would like to see the 
capital gains tax rate reduced but indicated he was wary of 
reopening the tax battle with democrats in congress 
im a little worried ill be honest with you having laid 
this tax question down for a while to reopen many many aspects of 
it he said 
treasury secretary nicholas brady said in an interview he was 
recommending against trying again for such a tax cut next year 
because he believes it would result in a fight with congress that 
the administration could not win the new york times reported 
today 
on the gulf crisis bush reiterated his position that if war 
breaks out it is not going to be another vietnam 
the agony of vietnam is still with us people remember a 
protracted war they remember a war where individuals were asked to 
fight with one hand tied behind their back in essence he said 
this will not be in my view that kind of confrontation 
bush said he still wants a peaceful solution but doubts that 
iraqi president saddam hussein believes the united states and its 
allies are ready to go to war over iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait 
the public would not support a long drawnout conflagration 
i think support would erode as it did in the vietnam conflict 
bush said 
asked why none of his cabinet members had children serving in 
saudi arabia he said i just dont know where their kids are 
the president called the armed forces the finest kids the 
best trained the best motivated the high achievers not the low 
achievers and so this argument that theres some kind of racism 
in this deployment i reject it out of the whole cloth 
vice president dan quayle meanwhile told a washington foreign 
policy conference tuesday its far from certain that the talks bush 
offered to hold with iraq will occur 
quayle accused iraq of an attempt to manipulate the process 
by insisting on meeting dates the united states opposes 
quayle who had considered a christmastime trip to the gulf to 
visit the troops has decided against it for logistical reasons 
among them the uncertainty of the timing of secretary of state 
james a baker iiis proposed visit to baghdad to meet saddam 
quayle plans to go later time an official said 
on another matter at his news conference bush denied his 
administration had flipflopped on scholarships reserved for 
minorities but he said such aid should be beyond challenge if 
it is privately financed 
still he predicted a possible court challenge to 
minoritytargeted scholarships and said he would be open to 
legislation to correct it fairly 
the policy announced earlier tuesday by the education 
departments civil rights chief bars federal funding of 
minorityonly scholarships but allows aid from other sources to be 
earmarked for minorities 
it was a partial reversal of a more sweeping ban announced last 
week that caught top white house officials unaware

investigating whether the 18000 auction sale of exbeatle paul 
mccartneys birth certificate was faked to inflate the documents 
value 
officials of the state licensing and regulation department and 
the harris county district attorneys office said tuesday the 
allegations made by the auctions promoter cheryl bean could lead 
to charges of deceptive business practices

involved in the sale 
ms bean accused terrell buyer brian taylor auctioneer ray 
simpson and phoebe moody who took the certificate to simpson on 
terrells behalf of faking the sale 
now when marshall and them want to sell it they can say 
well gee it sold for 18000 in houston and get a lot more for 
it later she said and ray simpson got free publicity 
worldwide publicity and thats worth a lot of money 
simpson said the sale was legitimate 
im not aware of any problem he said the sale went fine 
everythings taken care of as far as were concerned its a 
closed deal 
he declined to say if taylor had paid for the certificate 
taylor 26 a student at virginia commonwealth university was 
asked by reporters after the sale where he got the money for the 
purchase he joked that he had a paper route as a kid 
attempts to reach ms moody taylor and terrell were 
unsuccessful ms moody did not return phone calls to her office 
tuesday 
a student affairs officer at virginia commonwealth university 
said taylors phone was disconnected and he had asked that no 
forwarding information be released terrell who lives in 
alexandria va has an unlisted phone number

bowing to pressure from advocates for the 
homeless the walt disney co has decided to stop selling an toy 
figure of a tramp 
the rev christopher rose rector of grace episcopal church 
inspired the protests early this month when he cited steve the 
tramp as one of the most offensive toys of the 1990 chrstmas 
season 
im glad somebody there got a conscience rose said tuesday 
when he learned of disneys action but i feel it is a hollow 
victory because it is only a week before christmas 
the 5inchhigh plastic figure is one of a series of 14 
coppers and gangsters based on the movie dick tracy which 
was produced by disneyowned touchstone pictures 
the tramp is described on the package as hardened and bitter 
after a life on the mean streets a lout who would just as soon 
take your life as your wallet and will use and abuse any 
young helpless prey he comes across 
we feel that the action figure when viewed outside the 
fantasy world of dick tracy is being misunderstood said a 
statement released by the walt disney co in burbank calif 
monday evening 
joining in the statement were playmates toys inc of la mirada 
calif which is licensed by disney to manufacture and market the 
toy and the national coalition for the homeless based in new york 
city 
playmates has decided to discontinue production and 
distribution of the doll disney has removed the figure from 
shelves at its chain of retail stores and theme parks the 
statement said 
however disney spokesman chuck champlin acknowledged tuesday 
that it was too late to recall the toy from other retailers a week 
before christmas 
some chains discontinued sale of the tramp doll after advocates 
for the homeless protested and picketed stores 
rose brought the figure to the attention of advocates for the 
homeless in his annual warped toys for christmas display at his 
church dec 2 
a nationwide chain of 1200 stores kay bee toy and hobby 
pulled the figure from its shelves dec 7 after activists picketed 
its stores in the stamford town center 
marvin minkler an organizer of the stamford protest said 
playmates toys has donated more than 800 toys to his organization 
gateway communities homeless outreach to give to poor children 
a disney representative also promised to meet with gateway in 
january to see how they might collaborate on a program to help 
homeless people minkler said 
as you see in the end we agree the product is indefensible 
said champlin who two weeks ago released a statement defending 
sale of the figure 
michael stoops assistant director of the national coalition for 
the homeless said we appreciate the responsiveness of both the 
walt disney co and playmates toys in withdrawing the steve the 
tramp doll from store shelves and ending production and 
distribution 
rose said his steve the tramp figure is joining other offensive 
toys which he has been collecting for four years in a church 
storeroom 
someday rose said he hopes to open a museum of tasteless toys 
as a sad commentary on late 20thcentury culture

president ferdinand marcos and their associates stole up to 10 
billion until a popular revolt toppled his 20year rule in 1986 
david castro chairman of the presidential commission on good 
government said mrs marcos told him she wanted to settle the 
suits out of court despite a breakdown last week in talks to 
settle a suit filed against her in los angeles

and told her the government was aware of marcosheld assets in at 
least 10 countries that were not included in the suits already

believes belonged to marcos that could be the biggest thing that 
we could get our hands on he refused to give details of the 
account

he said he had reason to believe her he did not elaborate

50 million in marcos properties and 5 billion in damages

tentative settlement the government would have received 60 percent 
of the assets held by marcos trustees in five hong kong banks 
castro said that if the government recovered at least 200 
million from the banks it would drop the california suits 
but he said the negotiations halted after mrs marcos lawyers 
insisted on seeking the dismissal of the california cases claiming 
they had reached an agreement with the government to drop them 
castro said the move was a dirty trick 
the court has not ruled on the dismissal motion

pennsylvanias state government is facing 
a potential deficit approaching 1 billion that could lead to the 
layoff of state workers and cuts in welfare and other programs 
officials said 
state budget secretary michael hershock said tuesday every 
indication showed the states economy had stopped growing and was 
expected to be in a recession through march 
the disclosure of the looming 959 million deficit marked the 
first time the administration has acknowledged the magnitude of the 
states financial problems 
only last month gov robert p caseys campaign commercials 
described the state as the rising new star of america where the 
economy was flourishing 
hershock said the state would take a wide array of costcutting 
steps aimed at balancing the budget by june 30 the end of the 
fiscal year he said it was too soon to say if a tax increase would 
be needed 
taxes will be the last resort hershock said echoing 
previous statements by casey 
pennsylvania is not the only state facing a budget deficit 
because of the rising cost of services falling tax revenues and 
slowing consumer spending at least 30 states face deficits 
ranging from 42 million in tennessee to 1 billion in new york 
according to recent studies by the national association of state 
budget officers and the boston globe 
hershock said the state was caught in a bind between a weakening 
national economy and an increase in the need for welfare programs 
earlier this month the public welfare department disclosed it 
was facing a 440 million cash shortfall 
last week casey directed state departments to slash maintenance 
and other operating expenses by 6 percent and ordered continued 
controls on hiring and purchases 
hershock said a series of task forces would look at additional 
ways to trim spending and raise revenue such as selling surplus 
land and increasing state fees 
the state will also consider curtailing some programs that are 
optional under federal rules hershock said among them are dental 
podiatric and drugandalcohol abuse programs for welfare 
recipients 
layoffs for state workers are also being reviewed

four architects are asking a federal court to 
reject government tampering with their prizewinning design for the 
149 million korean war veterans memorial in the capital 
the architects from pennsylvania state university said tuesday 
they entered and won a 20000 design contest last year believing 
the winning entry would be built on the mall across the reflecting 
pool from the vietnam veterans memorial 
instead they alleged in a suit filed today in us district 
court their design was discarded by the government a memorial 
advisory board and an architectural firm 
from behind closed doors they surreptitiously developed 
another design and they have managed to slip before the public in 
recent days their own ideas for the memorial ideas that 
glamorize and romanticize the act of war architect don leon one 
of the plaintiffs said at a news conference 
as any korean war veteran can tell you that war no matter 
how noble its intent was never glamorous and romantic leon 
said 
named as defendants were the army corps of engineers the 
american battle monuments commission the korean war veterans 
memorial advisory board and cooperlecky architects of washington 
the advisory board was created by congress to select the site 
and the design subject to the commissions approval then 
cooperlecky was retained by the corps last may to finalize the 
plan and build the memorial 
the suit seeks an order blocking the defendants from 
proceeding with the new substituted cooperlecky architects 
design 
it also requests more than 250000 in damages from both the 
advisory board and cooperlecky it alleges that cooperlecky 
failed to consult with the original architects on the changes as 
required by contract and that the advisory board instructed 
cooperlecky on certain design additions and deletions 
retired army gen richard stilwell chairman of the advisory 
board said the suit has absolutely no foundation and in my 
humble view is aimed at frustrating the will of congress that a 
national memorial to the veterans of the korean war be established 
within the time frame dictated by public law 
w kent cooper of cooperlecky said tuesday he had not yet seen 
the suit and could not comment 
the penn state design called for a dreamlike collection of 
38 soldiers moving some unevenly across a remote landscape toward 
an american flag 
the revised design would confront visitors with the reality of 
actual war sculptor frank gaylord who is working with 
cooperlecky on the project said last week some soldiers are 
responding to unexpected unfriendly fire he said 
the new plan adds a grove of trees called a chapel and a

amnesty international issued a report today 
accusing iraqi occupation forces in kuwait of torturing and killing 
hundreds of people including 300 premature babies who died because 
incubators were stolen 
the iraqi embassy in london today said the report by the 
international human rights group includes stories that are 
absolutely false 
amnesty internationals first comprehensive description of 
abuses in occupied kuwait since the iraqi invasion on aug 2 gives 
few precise figures 
but norma johnson the human rights organizations head of 
communications said today that about 1000 people have been 
executed many hundreds have been tortured and something like 
10000 still remain in detention in kuwait 
people going out of their homes to buy food innocent 
kuwaitis are being picked up by the iraqi troops taken back to 
their homes and when they are identified by their parents for 
example are simply being shot in front of them she said in a 
radio interview with the british broadcasting corp 
president bush who has cited iraqi brutality as a reason for 
wanting to liberate kuwait said tuesday that the 82page amnesty 
report provides examples of iraqs primeval treatment of the 
vanquished kuwaitis 
in moscow soviet foreign ministry spokesman vitaly churkin told 
a news briefing today it is with anxiety and pain we have 
learned of the report iraq must leave kuwait unconditionally 
the iraqi embassy n london said in a statement that the 
reports allegations were baseless and stand in stark contrast to 
its amnesty internationals inaction at a time when hundreds of 
iraqi babies are dying owing to acute shortages of baby milk and 
medicine iraq contends a un embargo on trade with iraq has led 
to a shortage of medicine and baby formula 
some international observers say they fear that reports on iraqi 
atrocities might fan the flames of war the hundreds of deaths that 
londonbased amnesty and other independent human rights groups are 
reporting are far less than the thousands alleged by exiled kuwaiti 
officials 
amnesty notes in the report that iraqi authorities have engaged 
in similar practices against their own people for years 
the report cites widespread abuses of human rights in 
kuwait 
these include the arbitrary arrest and detention without trial 
of thousands of civilians and kuwaiti military personnel the 
widespread torture of such persons in custody the imposition of 
the death penalty and the extrajudicial execution of hundreds of 
unarmed civilians including children the report says 
in addition hundreds of people in kuwait remain unaccounted 
for having effectively disappeared in detention and many of 
them are feared dead it says 
the iraqis left more than 300 premature babies to die after 
stealing their incubators from kuwait city hospitals the report 
says amnesty says its investigators interviewed several doctors 
and nurses and that all saw bodies of the babies one doctor helped 
bury 72 bodies it says 
amnesty said its investigators spoke to victims of torture 
doctors who treated them their relatives and witnesses 
the report lists 38 methods of torture employed by iraqi forces 
including beatings while the victim was suspended from a rotating 
ceiling fan rape of women and young men stubbing out lighted 
cigarettes on victims eyeballs and tethering victims in the 
burning sun for hours without water 
the report said in some cases the arms legs and ribs of some 
victims were broken tongues and ears were cut off and eyes were 
gouged out in other cases victims were castrated the report 
said 
amnesty adds however the iraqi forces brutality in kuwait 
has shocked many people in the past four months but such abuses 
have been the norm for people in iraq for more than a decade 
a woman at the iraqi embassy in london said the ambassador was 
the only person authorized to comment on the amnesty report and 
that he was not available 
bush in comments sunday to interviewer david frost on a pbstv 
program scheduled to be aired jan 2 said he read it and handed 
it to barbara as we left camp david and she read about two pages 
of it and said i cant read anymore 
it is primeval he said 
the report says some people were slain because they carried 
kuwaiti money or refused to pledge allegiance to saddam others 
were killed for refusing to help iraqi soldiers steal medical 
equipment or while trying to flee the country 
some kuwaiti supporters estimate 7000 people have been killed 
by the iraqis and 25000 have been arrested 
various human rights groups have given estimates on the number 
of people killed or arrested in kuwait but they say the numbers 
cannot be verified without direct access to the country

japans cabinet will slow the growth of military 
spending under a new fiveyear defense plan defense agency 
officials said today 
analysts say the new plan which is to be approved thursday 
follows prime minister toshiki kaifus support of easing military 
spending in keeping with the collapse of communism in europe 
defense agency officials and senior lawmakers of kaifus 
governing liberal democratic party have opposed a sharp cut 
contending the reduction in tensions has not yet extended to the 
far east 
analysts say the new plan is only a provisional measure critics 
maintain that it does not go far enough in reducing japans defense 
spending 
during the current 138 billion fiveyear plan which ends in 
march spending increases averaged 54 percent a year 
the new plan envisions spending of 17068 billion for 
19911995 with an average annual increase of less than 3 percent 
agency officials said today speaking on condition of anonymity 
the defense agency insists it needs at least 17586 billion to 
meet 1976 guidelines stating that the selfdefense forces japans 
military should be capable of repulsing a limited smallscale 
foreign attack 
but finance minister ryutaro hashimoto insists the average 
annual growth of the defense budget should not exceed 3 percent an 
agency official said 
japan also depends on a defense treaty with the united states 
which in the past pressed this nation for bigger defense buildups 
it now is seeking more japanese funds to support the 50000 us 
troops based in japan 
a policy paper released by the national security council on 
tuesday said the world situation is heading in desirable 
directionsand the possibility of a largescale military conflict 
is lessening 
last week kaifu said in parliament that he planned to restore 
japans selfimposed defense spending ceiling of 1 percent of its 
gross national product 
the 1 percent ceiling imposed in 1976 was eliminated in 1987 
by the administration of prime minister yasuhiro nakasone who 
actively promoted the strengthening and modernization of the 
selfdefense forces 
the new plan has generated domestic criticism for not cutting 
defense spending more 
the rest of the world including the united states is 
revising its security policies to respond to the new world order 
said kazuhisa ogawa a political analyst 
but unfortunately japan is still sticking with the 
conventional stance of only seeing the soviet union as a potential 
enemy and following what the united states wants japan to do he 
said

prime minister salim hoss a veteran of 
the countrys turbulent politics resigned today to make way for a 
broadbased reconciliation cabinet that would boost efforts to end 
15 years of civil war 
hoss a sunni moslem submitted the resignation of his 14man 
government to president elias hrawi after a fourhour cabinet 
meeting a presidential statement said 
hoss who turns 61 on thursday had formed the government on 
nov 25 1989 
the statement said hrawi a maronite catholic asked hoss to 
remain in office as a caretaker prime minister pending 
consultations with members of parliament to name a successor 
hoss cabinet has performed some of the most striking 
achievements since the civil war broke out a commentator on the 
molsemrun voice of the nation said conditions now require a new 
cabinet with a wider representation to reconcile the nations major 
antagonists 
hoss a useducated former banker had said that he would not 
accept a new term the edia have speculated that his education 
minister omar karami also a sunni is the frontrunner for the 
post of prime minister 
karami 55 a lawyer inherited leadership of the second largest 
city of tripoli from his elder brother the late prime minister 
rashid karami 
rashid karami the longest serving prime minister since lebanon 
gained independence from france in 1943 was killed in a bomb 
explosion aboard an army helicopter on june 1 1987 
hoss served as acting prime minister after karamis 
assassination until his appointment by hrawi that was the fourth 
time since 1976 that he had served as head of the government 
under hoss the lebanese government crushed an 11month mutiny 
by rebel gen michel aoun on oct 13 after that it moved to 
enforce an arab leaguebrokered peace pact designed to end the 
christianmoslem feud 
on dec 3 the lebanese army deployed across the divided 
capital beirut to reunite the city and end militia control in a 
first step toward a final settlement of the civil war 
the peace plan which has been endorsed by parliament is widely 
regarded as a first step toward eventually ending the sectarian 
system of government which had been dominated by maronites 
the plan provided for a transitional stage during which the 
president loses some of his authority in favor of his moslem 
premier to ensure a balanced distribution of power between 
christians and moslems 
under an unwritten national agreement that has been in force 
since independence a lebanese president must be a maronite the 
prime minister a sunni and the parliament speaker a shiite moslem 
the new cabinet is supposed to group key figures from the main 
rival militia groups and political parties and work toward 
disbanding the private armies that had slowly eroded government 
authority since the outbreak of the civil war in april 1975 
it also was expected to map out a plan for reconstructing 
warravaged beirut and shoring up the economy 
the civil war has claimed more than 150000 lives and caused up 
to 18 billion of destruction according to the latest united 
nations estimates 
under the arab league peace plan an international fund would be 
set up early next year with a minimum of 2 billion for the 
reconstruction of lebanon

a judge today dismissed charges against a 
man accused of sexually assaulting a woman with 46 personalities 
after a prosecutor said a retrial would harm her 
winnebago county district attorney joe paulus said he decided 
against prosecuting 29yearold mark a peterson again after 
doctors for the 27yearold victim said the ordeal of another trial 
likely would cause her mental condition to worsen 
a jury convicted peterson nov 8 of seconddegree sexual assault 
but the judge threw out the verdict monday and ordered another 
trial the judge decided that peterson received an unfair trial 
because his psychiatrist was not allowed to examine the woman 
whose name has not been used to protect her identity 
it is clear that a new trial would not be in the best 
interests of the victim and in fact may cause her additional 
harm paulus wrote in a letter to winnebago county circuit judge 
robert hawley 
hawley signed an order this morning dismissing the charge of 
seconddegree sexual assault against peterson said winnebago 
county deputy district attorney vince biskupic 
it is a crime in wisconsin for someone to have sex with a 
mentally ill person who cannot understand the consequences of their 
actions the perpetrator must also know the person is mentally ill 
the jury ruled peterson a married exgrocery store bagger 
manipulated one of the womans personalities to have sex with her 
in the front seat of his car two days after they met 
paulus said the woman was willing to go through another trial 
but he told the judge in a letter that he consulted with three 
medical experts on multiple personality disorder and they advised 
against another trial 
one of the primary goals of the prosecution of mark peterson 
was to protect the rights of a mentally ill woman and hold her 
attacker accountable under the law paulus said 
the jury verdict although now set aside on a legal 
technicality sent a strong message to the community that mentally 
ill individuals in our society must be protected from those who 
prey upon them 
since the case became public the victims personalities have 
grown from 18 to 21 to 46 police were called to her home after she 
reported one personality was trying to kill her she has been under 
constant psychiatric care and has been hospitalized

said slovenia will be taking a great risk if voters in yugoslavias 
most prosperous republic choose this weekend to declare 
independence from the country 
the deputy defense minister admiral stene brovet told the 
federal parliament that the army was ready to act in accordance 
with the yugoslav constitution and those in slovenia who think 
differently are wrong

said it would take unspecified steps to preserve the countrys 
unity there were fears of army intervention but slovenian 
officials said the federal government has assured them that the 
military would not stop the vote sunday 
the leading slovenian daily delo today challenged the federal 
authorities 
do officials in belgrade think they can halt slovenias 
independence or do they simply want to accelerate our departure 
from yugoslavia it asked in a commentary 
with sundays referendum approaching the old federation is 
counting its last hours the paper said the federation of six 
republics and two provinces has been in existence since 1945 
justice minister vlado kambovski today told parliament the 
central government was warning state organs of slovenia about the 
great responsibility and the risk they are assuming if they 
unilaterally step out of the federation 
the government will undertake energetic steps to protect 
reforms and objective common interests of all peoples and 
nationalities in yugoslavia kambovski said without elaboration 
his comments were reported by the state news agency tanjug 
the parliament ended its session with the demand that slovenia 
reconsider holding the referendum because of its consequences 
prosperous slovenia governed by a centerright coalition since 
spring wants more independence from central authorities slovenia 
is backed by croatia where communists were also ousted by 
centerright parties in spring elections they want yugoslavia 
transformed into a loose confederation 
serbia the largest yugoslav republic where communists scored a 
victory in recent elections wants yugoslavia to remain a 
federation with a strong centralized government 
the differences have led to a deepening rift among the republics 
and strained their relations with the federation pushing the

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers in the 
united states and abroad 
 
dec 16 
the sun herald gulfport miss on congress 
businesses and industries are tightening their belts cutting 
back on expansion plans freezing salaries and payrolls reducing 
expenses and in some cases laying off workers the people in 
congress in contrast arent troubling themselves with such 
recessionfighting steps 
why should congressmen and women worry the business of 
government is booming senators fresh from getting a raise to 
98400 last february look forward to january when they will get 
the next pay raise they gave themselves this one to 101900 
representatives did themselves even better jumping their paychecks 
from 96600 to 125100 
lest you should think that those increases arent enough 
compensation for the wonderful job the congress is doing remember 
that senators will be allowed to keep up to 23837 in honoraria 
the fees for giving speeches writing articles and similar 
moonlighting house members will stop keeping honoraria 
one other note about the pay increases congressfolk achieved 
them without accountability it was done by voice vote no names 
recorded no fingerprints or footprints no individual 
accountability no need to defend a yea vote since the individuals 
voices were lost in the chorus 
next year congress will cost about 22 billion the cost has 
gone up by almost 2 billion in the last 20 years the climb upward 
has been as steadily and as surely as the rise in the national 
debt

toledo ohio blade on limiting congressional terms 
the throwtherascalsout brigade received a boost when 
president bush added his voice to those calling for term limits for 
members of congress 
bush is climbing upon a bandwagon that is not yet rolling 
voters in november indicated that they do not yet have a specific 
idea of how term limits will be achieved or what duration terms 
should be although 12 years is most often suggested rather there 
is a distinct hankering for change for somebody to do 
something to improve the way our system of government is or is 
not working 
we understand that sentiment of course the notion of the 
citizenlegislator as a publicspirited individual who serves his 
or her state or district for a limited period and then returns to 
private life is appealing it points to politics as a calling a 
responsibility to be shouldered not as a sinecure with a good 
pension 
quality leadership conscientious lawmakers representatives 
expert in their field and diligent in performing their duties would 
be thrown out arbitrarily with the rascals 
even so term limits reflect the groundswell of obvious public 
distaste for the game of politics it should not be ignored

chicago tribune on nasa 
even before the shuttle challenger blew apart shortly after 
launch in 1986 there were signs that the nations space program 
was drifting off course 
critics hoped the challenger accident would spark thorough 
selfexamination and new direction at the national aeronautics and 
space administration but recent troubles flaws in the hubble 
space telescope fuel leaks in the aging shuttle fleet and 
controversy over a planned space station suggest the program 
still lacks a sound flight plan 
a panel of experts has offered the white house a strong 
sensible proposal to get americas space exploration back on the 
right path 
in addition to being drafted with singular political sensitivity 
and shrewdness the proposals together set clear logical 
objectives for a new space era one defined primarily by federal 
budget deficits and the end of the cold war the first will mean 
maximizing the available resources to achieve agreedupon goals 
the second should lead to greater international cooperation and a 
reduced military role in space 
the 12member committee called for sweeping overhaul of the 
space program specifically it proposed that the space shuttle be 
largely replaced by a new family of powerful unmanned rockets it 
called for a major redesign and simplification of the space station 
aimed at lowering its 37 billion price tag 
and instead of concentrating on engineering feats and highly 
visible missions with limited practical value the panel would make 
scientific research on the earth and its environment the top 
priority 
this is the correct approach in the postcold war tightbudget 
era it can also regenerate interest in space exploration 
directing peoples imagination and enterprise toward new frontiers 
and achievements 
 
dec 12 
daily times primos pa on nasa 
the space shuttles future is up in the air if were 
interpreting signals from the government correctly 
the same nation that put a man on the moon is now trying to put 
the beleagured space shuttle in the garage a 12member space 
panel which was formed after nasas embarrassments began piling 
up has recommended that space shuttle flights be confined only 
to those that require human involvement 
lets face it the space shuttle program has had its share of 
troubles this year 
the panel also suggested that nasa go back to the drawing board 
and redesign its proposed space station and rethink its priorities 
one thing for certain is that whatever lies in nasas future it 
cant be much if nasas space exploration program in this case 
the shuttle is relegated to just a few flights all of which would 
be one giant step backward for mankind 
space travel is and will never be free of risks we have known 
and understood that for years 
 
dec 13 
the waco texas tribuneherald on young smokers 
the tobacco industry has launched a program to discourage 
children from taking up cigarette smoking the industry campaign 
supports state laws limiting cigarette sales to adults and puts new 
limitations on billboard advertising near schools 
the tobacco industry campaign is as far as it goes a worthy 
effort to prevent american youths from picking up a hazardous habit 
that can lead to death 
congress and state legislatures should not let the tobacco 
industry campaign sway them from passage of legislation that would 
further protect the health and lives of millions of americans 
hooked on smoking 
smoking is a serious health hazard and governmental bodies have 
the responsibility to take all reasonable steps to protect citizens 
from health hazards

los angeles daily news on the education secretary nominee 
lamar alexander president bushs choice to be the new education 
secretary is an outspoken education activist who gets results and 
thats exactly the kind of person the job requires 
as governor of tennessee from 1978 to 1986 alexander was a 
leader by no means a mere bandwagonhopper in the growing 
educational reform movement he came up with a package of 
significant improvements in tennessees schools including 
statewide merit pay for teachers before most other elected 
officials seemed ready even to acknowledge that the nations 
schools had severe problems in contrast to lauro f cavazos 
who resigned from the position alexander is a selfstarter 
who probably wont have to wait for cues from the white house to 
set an agenda for educational reform 
alexander compares favorably to cavazos in another way as well 
the former governor was effective in using his office to take on 
the teachers unions fellow republicans and others who didnt share 
his commitment to educational reform 
alexander will need to use these same political skills if he is 
to succeed in his new job the same establishment that fought his 
reforms in tennessee will be ready to jump down his throat in 
washington at the mere mention of such reform concepts as 
educational choice and a uniform national test for students

roswell nm daily record on germany 
a year ago when the berlin wall had just been breached and 
germanys future was uncertain a great deal of concern was 
expressed around the globe about the prospects of a united more 
powerful germany the parliamentary elections held recently to 
choose a new allgerman government should allay most of those 
fears 
in the first free balloting throughout germany since november 
1932 the voters reaffirmed the sensible political middle 
chancellor helmut kohls christian democratic union was given a 
solid mandate to build on the policies that led to swift 
reunification 
significantly the voters in the east endorsed kohls vision in 
about the same ratio as the electorate in the west and kohls 
vision is one of a united germany firmly moored to the north 
atlantic treaty organization and the european community 
barely a year after the berlin wall was toppled germans have 
voted for a united nation tied economically and militarily to the 
western democracies the oncewidespread fears that german unity 
would wrack the continent with renewed conflict suddenly seem 
overblown

arizona daily star tucson ariz on the persian gulf 
good red american blood is a renewable resource good rich 
crude oil is not 
because one represents life and the other represents the fuel 
that powers what has become the american way of life youd think 
both would be equally precious 
they are not 
the president who is willing to draw lines in the sand with 
american blood for the sake of saudi oil is unwilling to even 
discuss cutting down on domestic oil consumption 
energy secretary james watkins understands that a national 
energy policy without an energyconservation component is as 
useless as a ford without fuel 
thats why watkins built energy conservation into the proposal 
hes been working on for 18 months its also why the white house 
dinosaurs chief of staff john sununu chief economic adviser 
michael j boskin and budget director richard darman told watkins 
to drop conservation proposals from the national energy strategy 
the white house dinosaurs dont want an energy policy to go 
anywhere as minions of oil man george bush their goal is to 
preserve the status quo until every bit of money can be made out of 
every bit of oil on the face of the earth 
and if that takes every drop of good red american blood so be 
it 
the laissez faire attitude to energy conservation by the 
reaganbush administration assured that the united states would 
remain dependent on oil and heavily dependent on foreign oil

kuwait were almost universal in their praise of the way the bush 
administration has handled the gulf crisis 
bushs quickness to act his callup of military strength his 
clear warnings to saddam hussein and his successful grouping of an 
overpowering opposition all taken together made hussein realize he 
was on shaky ground 
releasing the hostages was his way of meeting at least one of 
the requirements bush laid down 
times were not easy for the hostages many of them spent four 
months in hiding many survived through the heroism of kuwaiti 
friends who hid and fed them 
but they might well have been there for years rather than 
months had bush not acted as strongly and decisively as he did 
almost universally the released hostages appear to realize that

the providence ri journalbulletin on the persian gulf 
amid the happiness at the freeing of iraqs hostages we want to 
take special note of nathaniel howell the us ambassador to 
kuwait and his embassy staff during four months of hostile 
occupation surrounded and isolated by unpredictable iraqi troops 
ambassador howell retained his calm and kept the embassy 
functioning 
with war scares running high he and his skeleton staff of four 
other foreign service officers managed to make do for most of their 
enforced isolation on embassy stocks of canned tuna augmented by 
water from a swimming pool by firmly resisting the iraqi demands 
that he depart ambassador howell helped to legitimize kuwaits 
status as an independent state he and his staff handled a tough 
situation with real distinction

sunsentinel fort lauderdale fla on sanctions 
south africa and iraq are as dissimilar as gold and oil yet the 
apparent importance of economic sanctions in bringing about 
substantive change in one country may have timely relevance to the 
other 
much of the world but principally the united states and the 
european community imposed a variety of sanctions on south africa 
during the 1980s as punishment for that nations adherence to a 
system of legal segregation known as apartheid 
now the international community is virtually united in an 
economic embargo and military blockade intended to compel iraq to 
withdraw from occupied kuwait 
while politicians debate the impact of the iraqi sanctions and 
ponder the wisdom of going to war to enforce the global will they 
could well draw an important lesson from recent developments in 
south africa

the sunday telegraph london on the persian gulf 
any visible failure of american nerve in the persian gulf 
would mean the end of the present system of world security what 
could take its place 
instead of grappling with this urgent question europes leaders 
prefer to waste their time talking about european political union 
which is not only a profoundly divisive aspiration but also one 
that could not possibly be realized for many years to come 
for once the united nations should be the focus of attention 
every ounce of european diplomacy should be concentrated on 
steeling american resolve to carry out the un mandate in the 
gulf 
world security not european union is the question of the hour 
it is sad that there is now no longer a single european statesman 
with the courage to say so

the times of india new delhi on the soviet union 
though outside reports about the soviet union being on the verge 
of collapse may well be exaggerated the country and its leader are 
facing the gravest crisis yet 
for the first time since mikhail gorbachev came to power the 
initiative seems to have shifted to the conservatives 
also for the first time key representatives of the army and the 
kgb are making major policy statemenets in public which are virtual 
warnings that the executive under gorbachev will have to move 
toward a major crackdown

the sydney australia morning herald on south africa 
is the african national congress in danger of losing its grip on 
the antiapartheid struggle in south africa 
that cleavages within the anc should be opening up now is not 
all that surprising 
there is a generational gap between the current top leadership 
and most of its members there is a jostling for position and 
power 
there are inevitable differences of opinion over tactics over 
how much trust to place in president de klerk and over how much 
should be compromised in the interests of a lasting peace 
what is surprising is the time it has taken the anc to begin 
getting its house in order the delay has been costly it has 
allowed indiscipline to grow in the ranks of the anc and that in 
turn to feed the blackonblack violence in natal province 
it has increased the chances of impatience for reform cutting 
anc leaders off from younger more militant members of the 
organization it has played into the hands of whites inside and 
outside de klerks government who seek to portray the anc as 
incompetent and dangerous for south africa 
it is a luxury of time the anc can no longer afford

the daily press ashland wis on tariff talks 
although there are several reasons why the depression of the 
1930s happened it is generally agreed that restrictive tariff wars 
contributed greatly 
today the united states is participating in the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade negotiations in brussels there has 
been a call among many politicians for the us to pull out of the 
negotiations that we are not receiving the kinds of assurances we 
need 
granted the doors are open wider for foreign products entering 
this country than they are for most we do pay a price when it 
comes to marketing our products worldwide but there are stronger 
reasons for us to remain a working partner in the tariff and trade 
agreements 
first levying tariffs on imported products quite simply fuels 
inflation many of the products in question will still be sold here 
to a willing public we will simply have to pay more 
but most important the us should not be party to a spiraling 
tariff war that eventually catches up with everybody prior to the 
depression the trading powers closed their doors to smaller 
nations thinking that we were immune to recessionary influences we 
were wrong 
promoting a world economy not only establishes a system 
versatile enough to withstand devastating depressions but also 
creates economic growth worldwide why is that important to us the 
world cant buy what we sell unless they have the money first

defense officials 
since the 1950s half the roughly 10000 soldiers stationed in 
this nato countrys frozen north had to stay near their posts 
during christmas in case of a soviet invasion said col per 
boethun of the norwegian supreme defense command 
but only a thousand or 10 percent are on duty this year 
because of eased eastwest tensions due at least in part to

a us envoy said wednesday that he has opened an 
unprecedented dialogue with china on human rights issues that he 
hopes can lead to the release of political prisoners 
richard schifter assistant secretary of state for human rights 
and humanitarian affairs said he submitted a list of 150 jailed 
democracy activists tibetans and religious figures and asked for a 
future casebycase review based on international human rights 
standards 
they didnt say no schifter told a news conference at the 
us embassy 
he said he told the chinese that persons who have not been 
guilty of any act of violence should be released 
the chinese made no promises but indicated willingness to 
continue talking he said 
the visit represents a remarkable break with chinas 
longstanding poicy of rejecting foreign comment on its treatment 
of prisoners of conscience 
it comes during a warming in uschinese relations badly 
strained by chinas june 1989 army attack on studentled 
prodemocracy protesters 
the bush administration has been courting china lately in an 
effort to win support for us policy in the persian gulf or at 
least obtain beijings pledge not to oppose it 
schifter arrived monday and held two days of talks withs 
officials from chinas foreign ministry justice ministry public 
security ministry and supreme peoples court and people responsible 
for minority affairs religious affairs and family planning 
topics of the talks included impending trials for leaders of 
last years massive democracy movement chinas religious policy 
and its sometimes coercive tactics to prevent families from having 
more than one child he said 
schifter is to travel to shanghai on thursday for a day of 
similar meetings with officials there 
they really engaged in a useful dialogue schifter said of 
chinese officials 
he refused to provide details but said it wasnt a matter of 
my simply sitting there and they would hear me out and then the 
meeting was over 
i presume at some point there will be an answer he 
said what that answer will be i cannot predict we hope for the 
best 
he said he made no threats and set no timetables but pointed 
out congress continued interest in linking chinas most favored 
nation trade status to improvement in its human rights policies 
he said the us embassy in beijing plans followup discussions 
kent wiedemann director of the state departments office of 
chinese and mongolian affairs who accompanied schifter said all 
of the chinese officials they met agreed to continue contact on 
the issues we raised 
asked if his visit indicated a new acceptance by the chinese 
that human rights has a place in bilateral relations schifter 
said that seemed to be implied that it was accepted 
ambassador james lilley called it a sea change in attitude 
but cautioned whether this ends up in concrete results remains 
to be seen 
china long has insisted that each country must set its own 
standards for human rights and that foreign relations should be 
based on pragmatic interests qian qichen the foreign minister 
repeated that stance in an article published only last week 
the official chinese media have carried only a single brief 
report on schifters visit and have not mentioned its purpose as 
recently as monday the party newspaper repeated charges that last 
years protesters secretly plotted to overthrow the government 
authorities have taken preparatory steps in recent weeks to 
begin trials of the accused plotters however sources have said 
the government plans to treat leniently the student leaders 
schifter said the chinese told him the cases were not ready for 
trial he said he asked that the us embassy be notified when the 
trials start and be allowed to send an observer if proceedings are 
open his request to visit a jail was rejected 
schifter said the talks were similar to meetings he had with 
soviet officials several years ago when he similarly submitted 
lists of political prisoners the bush administration has said 
previously said it did not think such a move would work in china 
schifter refused to release the list but said it included all 
wellknown participants in last years movement and previous 
democracy movements he confirmed one name was that of wei 
jingsheng who is serving a 15year jail term for advocating a 
multiparty system in 1978 
he also asked the chinese not to punish ge xun a chnese 
student who flew to beijing from the united states last week in 
hopes of attending the trial of an activist friend ge flew back 
the the united states wednesday after being told the case was still 
being investigated

three warring factions and liberias 
west africansponsored interim government are to meet thursday to 
try to fashion a ceasefire and end one of africas bloodiest power 
struggles 
the talks are being held in banjul gambia they begin four days 
before the oneyear anniversary of the rebel invasion that ousted 
former president samuel doe and quickly evolved into a brutal 
tribal conflict 
during that time more than 12000 civilians have been 
slaughtered and over 750000 liberians have fled to neighboring 
west african nations about half of liberias 23 million people 
have been left homeless 
charles taylor a onetime government bureaucrat led the rebel 
effort that toppled doe whom he accused of gross corruption and 
brutal oppression 
since then taylors army the largest of the three warring 
factions has overrun most of liberia outside the capital 
monrovia 
many liberians accuse taylor of prolonging the bloodshed since 
followers of a breakaway rebel leader prince johnson allegedly 
killed doe in september after brutually torturing him 
the third faction is composed of doe loyalists 
the warring factions disagree over the composition of a 
temporary government to organize elections and on how to enforce a 
ceasefire agreed at a summit of west african leaders in bamako 
mali on nov 28 
an 8000man west african army composed of troops from gambia 
ghana sierra leone nigeria and guinea has been sent to monitor 
the ceasefire 
taylor has rejected the interim government set up by veteran 
politician amos sawyer with the backing of other west african 
nations he refused an offer of six seats on sawyers cabinet 
which includes four doe loyalists and four members of johnsons 
faction 
the interim government was appointed by a group of exiled 
liberians at an august meeting sponsored by the economic community 
of west african states a west african peace plan bans sawyer from 
contesting proposed 1991 general elections to ensure a fair 
outcome 
both johnson and the leader of the liberian army brig hezekiah 
bowen have accepted sawyers government 
taylor has set himself up as president of his own interim 
administration and has insisted the other factions join his 
government they have all rejected the demand 
it remains to be seen if taylor will be tempted by sawyers 
offer of more cabinet positions and legislative seats but his 
immediate future depends on the west african army put together to 
monitor the ceasefire 
taylor attacked the west african troops when they sailed into 
monrovia on aug 5 he agreed to stop fighting after the west 
africans retaliated pushing his men out of monrovias eastern 
suburbs and bombing his supply lines 
taylor questions the neutrality of the force which is commanded 
by a nigerian general and has 4000 nigerian troops nigerias 
president gen ibrahim babangida was a friend of does 
taylor has accused the west african force of siding with 
remnants of does army whom the west africans are in the process 
of relocating from barracks at the presidential mansion and a 
nearby garrison to a camp 15 miles outside the capital 
the move came after johnson broke the ceasefire on nov 30 and 
attacked the doe loyalists whom he and many monrovians accused of 
attacks on civilians the west african army responded by attacking 
johnsons force and the fighting ended two days later johnsons 
men now are confined to a camp at caldwell a town northeast of 
monrovia

a soviet official said today a contract has been 
signed to allow an american to travel to the mir space station 
despite a report by the official soviet news agency that a 
sweepstakes offering the trip was a hoax 
the soviet side agreed to it we signed a letter of intent on 
nov 22 said vladimir nikitsky the deputy director of foreign 
trade subsidiary of npo energia which negotiates commercial deals 
for the soviet space program 
the contest operators who had pronounced the tass news report 
that the sweepstakes was a cosmic canard a misunderstanding 
appeared today before a grand jury 
the district attorneys office tuesday subpoenaed three 
executives of space travel services to answer questions on whether 
the promotion which contestants can enter by dialing a 900number 
for 299 violates texas lottery laws 
theres just so much information coming from so many sources 
so fast we just had to look into it were dubious said russell 
turbeville head of the consumer fraud division 
texas law bars charging people for a chance to win something 
space travel insisted it has a contract with the soviets the 
houston company also said the contest is legal because people can 
also enter by mail for free 
were looking forward to talking with them james davidson 
space travel senior vice president said of the inquiry grand 
juries investigate and this is a thing theyre interested in we 
have done nothing wrong 
after the company began offering a chance to win a trip aboard a 
soviet rocket and a week on the space station so many calls came 
in from around the country that the telephone system handling them 
collapsed monday 
by the time the system was restored tuesday tass had called the 
promotion a hoax 
we basically have our contract in hand so we know that were 
basically straight said david mayer space travel president 
a spokesman for space travel today expressed relief with the 
acknowledgement from soviet authorities that a contract existed 
theres a break guy brown said there were a lot of 
pieces of this that were secrets along the way mostly to protect 
space services 
there were a lot of people who wanted to put a deal like this 
together i could understand why there would be large number of 
people in that large a bureaucracy who wouldnt know about it 
davidson said if the project falls through callers will get 
refunds he said thousands had called the number 
space travel spokesman george nelson said the company has a 
contract with npo energia for the trip aboard a soyuz rocket to the 
mir station the soviet space agency glavkosmos must approve any 
contract 
however tass said glavkosmos does not know anything about 
this project and it quoted vladimir zenkin deputy commercial 
manager at npo energia as saying there were no deals on the 
subject 
mikitsky declined to comment on the tass report saying that the 
space deal was a commercial secret 
asked why no one else in glavkosmos or energiya seemed to know 
about the deal he said i am the only person responsible and i 
dont want people to dwell on it 
nelson said the energia contract was signed by uri pavelovitch 
semenov general designer in energias moscow office and was 
delivered with a cover letter signed by nikitsky 
space travel also said it has a letter from alexander i dunaev 
chairman of glavkosmos confirming that energia has full authority 
to sign that contract 
the exact cost of the purported deal was not disclosed but 
space travel officials have said it was more than the 12 million 
recently paid by a japanese broadcast company to put a reporter 
aboard the mir station 
the winner will be selected in a drawing in december 1991 for a 
trip in 1992 or 1993 space travel said 
space travel gets more than half the income from the 900 number 
and said it hopes to lure advertisers eager to put their logos on 
the winners spacesuit and on the spacecraft

president bush will not impose economic 
sanctions on norway even though it has refused to stop hunting 
whales the white house said wednesday 
the sanctions would have limited us imports of norwegian fish 
products 
were very pleased with the presidents decision said 
ingvard havnen press counselor at the norwegian embassy 
earlier secretary of commerce robert a mosbacher found that 
norways whaling practices were hindering international efforts to 
preserve whales such a ruling would normally result in sanctions 
against the offending country but in a letter to leaders of 
congress bush wrote 
norway has made improvements in the design of its research 
program in each year and a reduction in the take of whales from 68 
to five north atlantic minke whales given the progress made in 
the caliber of research undertaken and the efforts that have been 
made to improve usnorwegian scientific consultations i am not 
directing that sanctions be imposed on norwegian fish products 
the norwegian government has maintained that it must take some 
whales for research 
both norway and the united states belong to the international 
whaling commission which tries to limit the killing of whales the 
commission has passed a resolution saying that norways whaling did 
not meet its standards for research and asking norway to reconsider 
its plans

one of president bushs top military 
deputies in the persian gulf said today us troops would not be 
ready to mount an offensive by the jan 15 united nations deadline 
for iraq to leave kuwait 
lt gen calvin a h waller the deputy commander of all us 
forces in the gulf voiced that assessment after a meeting with 
defense secretary dick cheney chairman of the joint chiefs of 
staff gen colin powell and gen h norman schwarzkopf field 
commander of the american deployment 
waller told reporters the full american deployment would reach 
about 43000 troops by midjanuary but that latearriving armored 
units would not be combat ready for some time perhaps not until a 
month past the jan 15 deadline 
asked how he would respond if bush wanted to order a strike on 
iraqi forces before the full complement of american ground forces 
was ready waller said id tell him no im not ready to do 
the job 
in washington white house press secretary marlin fitzwater was 
asked about wallers remarks what he really said is they might 
not be as ready as they would like to be for all the 
contingencies he said 
but we are assured they will be ready to do whatever they are 
called upon to do fitzwater added 
cheney and powell told reporters traveling with them that the 
united states will be ready to go to war by the jan 15 deadline 
regardless of whether all reinforcements have arrived and reached 
combatreadiness 
cheney acknowledged some ground forces on the way to saudi 
arabia from kansas and germany probably would not be combatready 
by midjanuary 
waller said he did not anticipate bush ordering an attack 
immediately if saddam hussein ignores the united nations deadline 
to withdraw his army from kuwait 
its my understanding that hes been briefed and received 
briefings that the forces will not be ready for combat activities 
until sometime after the 15th of the month waller said in a 
candid 30minute session with reporters traveling with cheney and 
powell on their first joint visit to saudi arabia 
waller was the first senior military officer to say publicly 
that he would oppose any usled military strike until the full 
force was in place his comments raised eyebrows among deputies to 
scharzkopf and powell who said they were concerend that waller had 
been too candid 
i would say to the president and to the secretary and to the 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff that until our full 
complement of forces are on the ground that we should not initiate 
hostile activities waller said 
cheney and powell have more strategy sessions thursday and 
friday morning before spending the rest of friday and saturday on 
prechristmas visits with us troops 
we have an offensive capability should that be required 
cheney said most of the forces will be there by then jan 15 
but obviously there is additional work to be done before you would 
identify them as combatready 
meanwhile two senators just back in washington from visiting 
the gulf said they believe based on talks with us military 
commanders that the united states could conclude a war with iraq 
very quickly 
we believe that with the strategic power we have particularly 
in the air and on the sea that we should be able to complete the 
mission in a very short time sen ted stevens ralaska told 
reporters after meeting with bush 
i think if there is a war it will be a short one that will 
last no more than five days said sen daniel inouye dhawaii 
fitzwater said the senators were expressing their opinion based 
on briefings not any conclusion by our commanders 
obviously our commanders feel confident about their strength 
and superiority in many areas but we would be most reluctant to 
try and put numbers of days on it fitzwater said 
it was cheney and powells third visit each to saudi arabia 
since iraqs aug 2 conquest of oilrich kuwait but it is their 
first joint visit and first opportunity to meet together with 
schwarzkopf since he moved his command post from florida to riyadh 
in september 
neither plans to return to saudi arabia before the jan 15 
deadline and the pentagon wants the joint visit to convey to 
saddam the administrations willingness to use force if necessary 
to free kuwait 
but cheney answered with a blunt no when asked if his visit 
should be viewed as a final planning trip for war 
on monday secretary of state james a baker iii told nato 
allies to expect a partial iraqi withdrawal from kuwait as part of 
a ploy to sway world opinion against a usled military 
action 
but cheney said the pentagon had no evidence saddam was setting 
the logistical stage for such a move on the contrary he said 
iraq continues to pour more troops into kuwait and southern iraq 
primarily infantry but also some heavier armored forces 
if he is planning to withdraw we certainly havent seen any 
evidence of it the secretary said

the town bell of this 320yearold new 
england farming community has made a ringing comeback just in time 
for the holidays without interrupting anyones silent nights 
its good to hear it ringing again said a cory bardwell 
who has lived next to the bell all his life 
because of the season more than anything i thought it was 
neat said selectman thomas hurley 
the bell was silenced last may as a result of a civil suit 
ordering the bell shut down at night town officials shut the bell 
off entirely because they couldnt afford a timer the lawsuit was 
filed by a couple new to town who complained the bell kept them 
awake 
the 1800pound bell tolled the hours wednesday from a 
whitesteepled church on main street thanks to a timer installed at 
an estimated cost of 200 to 300 which will be paid for by 
private donations hurley said 
the return of the bell owned by the town but housed in the 
first congregational church which once doubled as town hall comes 
at a time when the famous big ben of london faces a potential snub 
british broadcasting corp officials say big bens chimes which 
the bbc traditionally broadcasts to introduce the queens christmas 
day message and ring in the new year may not be used this year 
because the main bell has lost its distinctive tone because of 
repairs 
tuesday night in hatfield jeffrey tannatt and randy snyder 
clambered into the church attic and installed the timing mechanism 
ringing to a close a dispute that began two years ago 
richard and pamela carnall newcomers to town moved from the 
nearby city of northampton to hatfield population 3000 in august 
1988 settling down in a 19thcentury house on main street next 
door to the church 
at that time the town bell was broken but in december the 
bell was fixed and started its hourly tolling and the carnalls 
started waking up 
the carnalls tried but failed to convince town selectmen of 
their plight so they filed a civil suit 
oldtimers grumbled that the ringing of the bell was a cherished 
custom and an integral part of the new england charm of their 
pretty town 
the carnalls who have an unlisted telephone number have 
declined comment on the return of the bell 
but at the time they won their case before a jury last may they 
said they were happy with the decision and only sought quiet 
nights 
they certainly never asked that the bell be turned off all 
through the day and they just wanted it turned off at night so i 
guess that theyre content said w michael ryan who represented 
the couple in their suit

in an age when less is more and calorie counting 
is as american as the sixpack distillers are introducing light 
liquors vodka gin rum and even whiskey to attract a new 
generation of drinkers 
light liquors let drinkers imbibe without getting fat from the 
calories or drunk from too much alcohol distillers say and they 
hope the holiday season will provide a good test market 
but while light beer has established itself light liquor may be 
a harder sell 
sometimes the only way you can convince people this isnt 
watereddown booze is to have them try it said brian tyrol 
president of vermont distillers in waterbury vt 
tyrol said his 60proof light vodka does about 60 percent of the 
business of the regular vodka the light gin about 45 percent the 
biggest customers are women and the elderly he said 
tyrol said light vodka and gin have 82 calories per 50 
milliliters the amount in a nip compared with 115 calories for 
the regular heavier version of those liquors 
the idea of light liquors isnt new four years ago ms 
walker a bottler in somerville introduced light vodka gin rum 
and scotch 
we felt that the light category was exactly what was happening 
in society said michael brody vice president and director of 
sales for ms walker we felt this was a perfect opportunity 
but under liquor certification rules the products had to carry 
the label diluted ms walkers light liquors bombed when 
people saw diluted they had a problem with that brody said 
then seagrams the giant canadian distiller got into the act 
introducing mount royal light a canadian whiskey that is 54 proof 
and has fewer calories 
because seagrams added some flavorings to the light whiskey it 
could be classified as a specialty drink and didnt have to carry 
the diluted tag 
ms walker followed the seagrams flavoring strategy and about 
six months ago introduced a 53proof light vodka with a third fewer 
calories the light vodka sells about 5 percent of what ms 
walkers regular vodkas sell brody said 
next year the company plans to introduce a light rum for the 
holidays ms walker is introducing a light eggnog that goes easy 
on the alcohol and calorie content 
the restaurateurs like it with the liquor liability laws 
today brody said they can serve four drinks with the same 
alcohol content as three 
brody said the added flavorings smooth the alcoholic bite of the 
light vodkas giving them a taste similar to imported vodkas which 
also use flavorings regular american vodkas arentallowed to use 
flavorings 
seagrams distills the flavor and the alcohol of its light 
whiskey in separate tanks then some of the alcohol is thrown out 
and the remainder is blended and bottled 
despite the seagrams example most distillers jumping on the 
light bandwagon prefer to stick with white liquors like vodka 
gin and rum 
whiskey is too macho a category for light liquor tyrol 
said if youre a whiskey drinker youre not looking for 
something light you really want the full impact

the government today released figures showing 
a 72 percent drop in the use of cocaine over five years president 
bush said that shows our hard work is paying off 
there has been some marked progress changing attitudes and 
behaviors as more and more of our neighbors and coworkers have 
turned away from illegal drugs health and human services 
secretary louis sullivan said in announcing the new figures 
he said the number of people using illicit drugs was down 44 
percent over the past five years from 23 million in 1985 to 129 
million in 1990 
the news we have today sugggests that our hard work is paying 
off bush said he spoke briefly at a news conference called to 
release the 1990 national household survey on drug abuse 
although the government study showed dramatic declines in casual 
and moderate use of cocaine it showed continued high rates of 
frequent or intense cocaine use 
among 62 million people who used cocaine at least once in the 
past year in 1990 the study showed approximately 662000 people 
used it once a week or more down from 862000 in 1988 
however the number of people who use cocaine daily actually 
increased to 336000 for 1990 from 292000 in 1988 
the survey found that while the overall number of current 
cocaine users decreased in 1990 from 1988 the number of 
crackcocaine users remained stable there were nearly half a 
million current crack users among the 16 million who used cocaine 
at least once a month in 1990 
some of the reports other key findings 
current cocaine use use at least once in the past month has 
decreased 72 percent since 1985 and 45 percent since the last study 
was conducted in 1988 
the number of current cocaine users dropped from 58 million 
29 percent of the population over age 12 in 1985 to 29 million 
15 percent in 1988 to 16 million 08 percent in 1990 
marijuana remains the most commonly used illicit drug in the 
country although current use of marijuana declined from 1979 
when there were 225 million users 127 percent to 1990 when 
there were 102 million 51 percent current users 
the number of adolescents using drugs fell by 13 percent from 
18 million in 1988 to 16 million in 1990 adolesents currently 
using cocaine fell by 49 percent from 225000 in 1988 to 115000 in 
1990 
the survey was based on interviews with 9259 people age 12 and 
over 
bush said one of the most encouraging conclusions of the study 
was the decline in drug use among teenagers which he called 
evidence theyre learning to say no 
however bush said a declaration of victory would be 
premature noting that drug use still remained an enormous 
national health problem 
there will be no retreat in our efforts to end the 
inernational menace of drugs he said 
these figures must be greeted with guarded optimism said 
sullivan in spite of our individual and national efforts there 
are still millions of americans trapped in the web of addiction 
poor health violence crime and death 
despite this impressive good news about our progress in 
reversing our nations drug using habits many pockets of serious 
drug problems remain the hhs secretary said 
senate judiciary committee chairman joseph r biden jr ddel 
criticized the survey saying it actually misses more addicts 
than it counts 
a study by his committees staff estimates some 24 million 
people use cocaine at least once a week not the 662000 claimed by 
the survey by the national institute on drug abuse the committee 
report says the number of such cocaine users actually has increased 
by 200000 rather than declining by that number as the nida survey 
showed 
administration officials acknowledged that the nida survey 
misses people in prison in shelters and in other institutions such 
as dormitories and that some 18 percent of the households contacted 
declined to participate in the survey 
but dr james o mason assistant secretary for health said the 
nida surveys tracking of trends if not the precise numbers of 
users are accurate as the survey has been administered the same 
way each of the 10 times it has been conducted since 1971 
although not illicit drugs alcohol and cigaratte use also were 
tracked in the study which showed declines in both categories 
there were 1029 million current drinkers of alcoholic beverages 
at least once in the past month in 1990 compared with 1131 
million in 1985 and 1058 million in 1988 weekly alcohol drinkers 
decrased from 546 million in 1985 to 473 million in 1988 to 417 
million in 1990 
current cigarette users dropped from 603 million in 1985 to 
571 million inthe88 to 536 million in 1990 
this represents a decrease of 67 million persons smoking 
cigarettes in the past five years sullivan said i view this 
as a remarkable achievement as more and more people start taking 
responsibility for their own health

i was tickled to death she said i thought that would be 
it

iraq told its people today to stockpile oil during the winter to 
avoid shortages if war breaks out a us military commander said 
american troops may not be fully prepared to attack iraqi forces 
for another two months 
however the white house said the tens of thousands of us 
soldiers in the persian gulf will be prepared to do whatever is 
required 
meanwhile turkey the only nato nation bordering iraq also 
appeared to be making preparations for a possible war in the gulf 
region 
a senior nato source in brussels belgium where the western 
alliance is based said today that turkey recently asked nato to 
send several air units from its multinational force to bolster the 
frontier region 
the source said turkey wants the units by jan 15 the date the 
united nations authorized the use of force if iraq does not pull 
out of kuwait 
the iraqi oil ministry announced it will provide the market with 
fuel oil kerosene cooking gas gasoline and diesel so that 
purchases can be made 
we hope that all citizens will buy their needs so they may 
overcome any shortages that might result from an aggression on our 
oil installations said the announcement published in the 
governments aljumhuriya newspaper 
the refineries are considered prime targets for air strikes by 
the usled multinational force if war breaks out in the gulf 
the announcement was iraqs latest reported attempt to prepare 
for war 
saddam hussein has called up army reservists up to age 33 
ordered building owners to build bomb shelters stepped up classes 
in civil defense and first aid and planned the evacuation of 
cities 
on jan 15 evacuation drills are scheduled in the capital 
baghdad 
in a television interview with turkish journalist saddam said 
iraq has tried hard to avoid a war but that it is up to the 
international tyrants to make the decision to fight the 
interview conducted in baghdad on friday was scheduled for 
broadcast tonight a text was made available in advance 
the us military officer who commented on american readiness 
for war is lt gen calvin a h waller the deputy commander of 
all us forces in the gulf 
waller made his assessment after a meeting with defense 
secretary dick cheney the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
gen colin powell and gen h norman schwarzkopf field commander 
of the american deployment 
cheney and powell arrived in the gulf today on a visit intended 
to emphasize us willingness for fight 
waller told reporters the full american deployment would reach 
about 430000 troops by midjanuary but that latearriving armored 
units would not be combat ready for some time perhaps not until a 
month past the jan 15 deadline 
asked how he would respond if bush wanted to order a strike on 
iraqi forces before the full complement of american ground forces 
was ready waller said id tell him no im not ready to do 
the job 
asked about wallers remarks white house press secretary marlin 
fitzwater said in washington what he really said is they might 
not be as ready as they would like to be for all the 
contingencies but we are assured they will be ready to do whatever 
they are called upon to do 
earlier today cheney and powell told reporters traveling with 
them that the united states will be ready to go to war by jan 15 
most of the forces will be there by then but obviously there is 
additional work to be done before you would identify them as 
combatready cheney said 
they refused to detail about what they would discuss with 
schwarzkopf saying they did not want to tip their hand to saddam 
cheney and powell are to follow their military talks by spending 
two days making prechristmas visits with us troops in the 
region 
turkeys reported request for several air units which must be 
approved by defense officials of the north atlantic treaty 
organization marked the first time it had had asked nato for 
reinforcements 
turkey has cut off a key iraqi oil pipeline to comply with 
unimposed trade sactions against iraq but it has not sent any 
troops to the usled multinational forces arrayed against iraq 
making unclear what role if any turkey plans to play if warbreaks out 
in the gulf 
nevertheless turkeys armed forces of 800000 are the second 
largest in the nato alliance after the united states and 100000 
turkish troops are along the border with iraq tying up eight iraqi 
divisions

socialite georgette mosbacher wore the 
fabulous hope diamond on wednesday to publicize a 1 million gift 
to the smithsonian museum where its displayed 
laughing at the diamonds legendary curse she said id wear 
it in my navel for a million bucks 
mrs mosbacher president of a new york cosmetics company was 
the first person to wear the diamond and its diamondstudded 
necklace publicly since it was given to the smithsonian in 1958 by 
new york jeweler harry winston museum officials said 
the wife of commerce secretary robert mosbacher fingered the 
glittering walnutsize 455carat diamond valued at more than 
100 million and confided to a horde of jostling photographers at 
a midmorning news conference 
of course diamonds look best on bare skin but its the wrong 
time of day 
too bad for us one photographer muttered 
instead of bare skin mrs mosbacher chose a tightfitting mauve 
knit dress with high ruffled neckline to show off the 
midnightblue diamond that once adorned the bosoms of marie 
antoinette and countess dubarry of france more than 200 years ago 
i dont want to take it off pouted mrs mosbacher who was 
closely watched by an armed museum guard who stood unblinking a few 
feet away 
mrs mosbacher wore the diamond as a publicity stunt to 
celebrate a 1 million gift from the harry winston research 
foundation for the renovation of the geology gems and minerals 
hall at the national museum of natural history where the hope 
diamond is exhibited 
the renovation will cost about 12 million with half the total 
coming from private sources its scheduled to be completed in late 
1994 
ordinarily the diamond is kept in a museum vault behind 
inchthick glass guarded around the clock by police k9 dogs and 
sophisticated electronic devices 
the museums biggest tourist attraction its viewed by 6 
million to 8 million visitors annually 
according to legend the diamond was stolen from the forehead of 
an indian idol worshiped by followers of rama sita the god 
supposedly placed a curse on the diamond ensuring that tragedy 
would befall anyone who subsequently owned or wore it 
paul e desautels retired curator in charge of the national 
collection of gems at the museum has declared that the curse is a 
carefully nurtured fairy tale 
nevertheless the diamonds most famous owner after french 
king louis xiv was washington socialite evalyn walsh mclean who 
had more than her share of troubles after buying the jewel in 1911 
her firstborn son died of injuries from an automobile accident 
when he was 9 her husband was an alcoholic who died in an insane 
asylum and her only daughter died from an overdose of sleeping 
pills 
mrs mosbacher said shes an optimist who doesnt believe in bad 
luck and had no qualms about slipping the hope diamond around her 
neck 
anything that can attract 1 million from the private sector 
for the smithsonian has got to be good luck she said i told 
them id wear it in my navel for a million bucks

housing starts rose in november for the first 
time in 10 months but construction of singlefamily homes 
plummeted to a level not seen since the last recession the 
government said wednesday 
the declines in singlefamily starts and permits suggest we 
havent hit bottom yet and there may be further deterioration in 
the coming months said economist john a tuccillo of the 
national association of realtors 
thomas holloway an economist with the mortgage bankers 
association agreed but added the bottom is in sight and we see 
improvement in the spring of next year 
the commerce department said starts of new homes and apartments 
rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 113 million units 
advancing for the first time since a 232 percent gain in january 
but the advance was due solely to a 102 percent rebound in 
multifamily starts which had dropped 28 percent a month earlier 
multifamily starts totaled 357000 at an annual rate in november 
david g seiders an economist with the national association of 
home builders said the multifamily rate could not be sustained 
theres no way thats going to happen he said 
but he and other economists were hardpressed to explain the 
pickup 
the october level was too low and the november rate was too 
high robert sheehan an economist with the national apartment 
association said an average of the two levels at 267000 units 
is probably closer to the real trend 
economists attributed the continuing weakness in the 
singlefamily sector to steep inventories of unsold homes and 
consumer uncertainty over the economy and the persian gulf some 
also said that tight restrictions on credit were keeping marginal 
buyers out of the market 
builders are facing up to the demand side of the market and 
reacting to it seiders said 
applications for building permits often a barometer of future 
activity fell 14 percent to 907000 the lowest level since 
888000 forms were issued in april 1982 
until november housing starts had fallen for nine months in a 
row the first time that has happened since the government began 
keeping track of permits in 1959 during the first 11 months of the 
year starts were down 128 percent from the same period of 1989 
construction of singlefamily units totaled a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 772000 down from 856000 in october it 
was the lowest level since 737000 units were started in october 
1982 
the multifamily activity was led by a rebound in buildings 
containing five or more units up 1013 percent to 314000 units 
these units had declined 268 percent in october 
housing starts rose 213 percent to 478000 units in the south 
and 54 percent to 274000 in the west 
but they were down 14 percent to 140000 units in the 
northeast which has seen some of the slowest housing activity in 
recent months 
starts were unchanged at 237000 units in the midwest

director 
waco productions ltd of hong kong announced plans in september 
to make a film based on the life of buddha to be directed by 
bertolucci whose previous films have included the sheltering 
sky the last emperor and last tango in paris

was seeking financial backers for an independent project on the

the court agreed that waco productions ltd chairman richard 
colson had spent time and 14 million on planning for the film

terms and that there was no evidence that bertolucci was in any 
way threatening to use any original or confidential ideas from 
waco

president mikhail s gorbachev on wednesday 
mentioned four regions where political or ethnic unrest may force 
him to impose a state of emergency or presidential rule here is a 
look at the regions 
 
baltic republics the republics of latvia lithuania and 
estonia were independent between the two world wars but were seized 
by josef stalin in 1940 they declared their independence this 
year although gorbachev has rejected the declarations leaders of 
the independence movements in the baltics have claimed in recent 
weeks that the kremlin was preparing to crack down on them 
 
south ossetia separatists in this northern region of soviet 
georgia declared their own republic and elected a legislature in 
september in response georgias parliament moved to end 68 years 
of autonomy in south ossetia and gave it the prerevolutionary name 
of samchadlo on dec 12 following three fatal shootings a state 
of emergency and curfew were declared in the area georgian and 
national interior ministry troops were sent in and tensions 
reportedly remain high 
 
nagornokarabakh more than 200 people have been killed

us military commanders in the persian gulf 
indicated a war with iraq could be wrapped up within five days two 
senators said wednesday after briefing president bush on their trip 
to the region 
sen ted stevens ralaska and sen daniel inouye dhawaii 
told reporters outside the white house that they got their 
impression that any war would be short from classified and other 
briefings during their tour of saudi arabia bahrain egypt and 
israel 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater asked about the 
senators comments said we would be most reluctant to try and 
put numbers of days on it were not talking about war were 
talking about a peaceful resolution 
but he also noted bushs oftenstated promise to avoid a long 
drawn out vietnamtype confrontation 
fitzwater said there had been no new contact with iraq on dates 
or times for the proposed visit of secretary of state james a 
baker iii to baghdad or the white house visit by iraqi foreign 
minister tariq aziz 
we get no response we dont see any opening fitzwater 
told reporters about the stalemate over when to hold the two 
meetings on resolving the gulf crisis 
echoing bushs comments of earlier in the week the spokesman 
said we keep hearing saddam hussein doesnt really believe we 
would take action if iraq has not pulled its troops out of kuwait 
by the jan 15 un deadline 
we assume at least a degree of rationality that he would not 
want to destroy himself and his country therefore we intend to 
continue to try to use every means at our disposal to convince him 
of the wisdom of pulling out fitzwater said 
asked about the senators prediction of a fiveday war 
fitzwater said i would attribute that to their calculations from 
all of the things they heard as opposed to any one commander giving 
that date 
stevens told reporters we believe that with the strategic 
power we have particularly in the air and on the sea that we 
should be able to complete the mission in a very short time 
inouye said if there is a war it will be a short one that 
will last no more than five days 
the senators who returned home tuesday night declined to say 
whether bush agreed with their assessment 
their statements came as a senior us military official in 
saudi arabia said the us command would not be ready to attack by 
jan 15 
but inouye told reporters with all the air power we have 
there with six carrier battle groups with the b52s with our 
missiles with our rockets with our fighter bombers if we cannot 
gain air superiority within six hours lets say wipe out their 
missile sites and their command and control structures within 
twothree days then something is wrong with our defense 
structure 
the troops are ready the commanders are ready the allies are 
ready the question is is america ready for a war inouye said 
inouye is the chairman of the senate appropriations subcommittee 
on defense and stevens is the ranking republican on the panel 
bush also met wednesday with a group of us business leaders 
who expressed their support for his policies in the gulf 
they said they also discussed the economic impact of the gulf 
crisis particularly the hardship on latin and other countries 
where oil prices have escalated

president bush will consider taxing imported 
oil as part of a national energy strategy the department of energy 
said 
the tax will be among some 67 policy options the department is 
preparing for bush doe spokeswoman joelle ziemian said late 
tuesday night 
an import tax allows domestic oil producers to raise their price 
and increase profits but it forces consumers to pay more for both 
imported and domestic oil 
word of the possible tax drew immediate fire from new england 
lawmakers who thought they had finally defeated the idea during the 
october budget deficit debate 
its hard for me to believe that its back frankly said 
sen joseph lieberman dconn it will have a crippling and very 
discriminatory effect on the northeast 
rep silvio conte rmass the ranking republican on the house 
appropriations committee criticized the proposal in a letter to 
bush saying it was as an unfair burden on colder regions and 
particularly areas such as new england that depend heavily on 
foreign oil 
the administration plans to consider the energy policy options 
including the import tax then pare them down into a national 
energy strategy expected to be proposed this spring 
a study by the northeastmidwest institute a research group 
that represents 18 states from minnesota and iowa to new england 
indicated the tax would cost each new englander 133 per year 
higher than any other region the midatlantic and midwest states 
were close behind with a perperson cost of about 100 
doe has not made public the specifics of the proposal but a 
common version has called for an import fee of 5 per barrel under 
a ratio used by some oil industry analysts that could translate 
into an extra 12 cents per gallon of gasoline at the pump 
ziemian initially said the oil import tax idea was not an 
option it is not going to the president but late tuesday night 
she said her earlier statements were incorrect and that the oil 
import tax proposal would go to bush

police questioned two women today in 
connection with a series of slayings of middleaged male motorists 
in north florida and south georgia but released them six hours 
later 
there is no reason to believe they had any connection with the 
murders said asa higgs a spokesman for the jacksonville 
sheriffs office 
police sgt steve weintraub said earlier the two women were 
picked up because they matched the descriptions somewhat 
all of the eight known victims were white roughly between the 
ages of 40 and 60 all were shot some repeatedly some were 
stripped naked and robbed their bodies dumped along rural roads 
two other men remain missing 
police who have been chasing tips on sightings of two women 
resembling composite sketches of the suspects got word this 
morning of two women who fit the depictions staying at the gator 
lodge motel on us 1 south 
both women who had been staying at the motel since dec 14 
originally gave police more than one name and age weintraub said 
but higgs said later that their identities had been checked out and 
the women were not the ones being sought for questioning in the 
killings 
authorities in volusia county reported some two dozen calls this 
week about reports of two women hitchhiking near new smyrna beach 
marion county authorities say they have received some 250 
unconfirmed sightings from all over the united states and canada 
weintraub said jacksonville authorities had been receiving calls 
this week about two women along interstate 295 attempting to flag 
down motorists the two females were standing around a white 
pickup truck 
from what i understand that does fit these same methods 
used in the other slayings 
still authorities are uncertain that all of the killings are 
related 
two women seen leaving an accident scene near gainesville in 
july involving the stolen car of a parttime missionary are 
considered suspects however the missionary whose car had traces 
of blood in it remains missing as does one other man 
police renderings of the suspects show an ovalfaced 
stringyhaired blonde and a chubby roundfaced darkcomplexioned 
woman wearing a baseball cap

a new indictment in the 1963 sniper 
killing of medgar evers gives mississippi a chance to show how much 
it has changed the widow of the slain civil rights leader said 
wednesday 
this is a time mississippi can shine before the rest of the 
county and the world and say we are not what you have always 
imagined us to be that we are on the move and that theres 
potential here myrlie evers said wednesday in a telephone 
interview from her los angeles home 
and mississippi one day as medgar said might be the example 
for the rest of the states to follow 
byron de la beckwith a segregationist who twice stood trial for 
evers death faces a new murder charge in the case he was freed 
on 15000 bond tuesday from a chattanooga tenn jail a hearing 
was set for feb 22 on whether he should be returned to mississippi 
to stand trial a third time 
prosecutors said new witnesses including a former ku klux 
klansman led to a new murder charge against beckwith 
the retired fertilizer salesman who has said he did not kill 
evers said wednesday he is trying to publish a book that would 
reveal evers killer and is now granting only paid interviews 
thats legal expenses you know i dont have any money for a 
lawyer ive spent what ive inherited three times beckwith said 
from his home in signal mountain tenn thats the only way i can 
do it now 
beckwiths fingerprint was found on the rifle used by a sniper 
to kill evers he said the weapon was stolen from his home two 
allwhite juries deadlocked in 1964 trials and the murder charge 
eventually was dropped 
justice can be only served if there is a final conclusion 
once and for all district attorney ed peters said tuesday in 
announcing the indictment of beckwith by a grand jury in jackson 
peters said new witnesses black and white have taken the 
courageous step of coming forward he said their identities were 
being protected 
assistant hinds county district attorney bobby delaughter who 
led the new inquiry said information from delmar dennis a 
onetime klansman who later became an fbi informant helped bring 
the new indictment 
dennis was quoted in a 1975 book on the klan as saying beckwith 
told him he shot evers delaughter said other new witnesses 
corroborated his story 
the rev robert lt smith of jackson also has said he is a new 
witness 
smith 88 said he saw beckwith at a church gathering in jackson 
the night evers was slain 
that would contradict testimony in the 1964 trials from two 
white police officers who said beckwith was not at the church 
rally beckwith contends he was not in jackson when evers was shot 
in his driveway 
evers 37 was the field secretary for the national association 
for the advancement of colored people at the time of his death he 
was active in voter registration efforts and other attempts to 
bring racial equality to the south 
the assassination called barbaric by president kennedy 
focused national attention on the civil rights struggle in 
mississippi and helped push forward civil rights reforms 
mrs evers said wednesday that more important than a murder 
conviction is that her husband reaches his deserved place in 
history 
i want a trial a conviction and after that my emphasis 
shifts to people becoming more and more aware of who medgar was 
and to realize that medgar evers was a pioneer she said

the bush administration has dropped its 
opposition to a plan by american telephone amp telegraph co to 
provide additional phone service to the soviet union through an 
east bloc satellite consortium 
atampt citing a 140 percent increase in ussoviet phone traffic 
from 1987 through 1989 began seeking federal permission 12 months 
ago to provide about 100 additional phone circuits to the soviet 
union through the intersputnik system 
the state department said in may that it saw no reason to 
deviate from existing us policy that requires most satellite 
telephone traffic between the two countries to be carried by the 
119nation intelsat satellite cooperative 
however deputy secretary of state lawrence s eagleburger and 
deputy secretary of commerce thomas j murrin reversed course in a 
dec 14 letter to federal communications commission chairman alfred 
sikes 
the officials said the modest nature of the atampt proposal 
alleviated us concern that intelsat would suffer from the 
competing service 
the administration views this action as an important step in 
promoting business development and commerce between the united 
states and the soviet union the state department said in a 
prepared statement 
atampt spokesman herb linnen said the company was pleased with the 
administrations change of heart 
atampt has about 60 circuits to the soviet union by means of 
intelsat undersea cables and land lines atampt uses about 22000 
intelsat circuits worldwide 
the company said demand for phone calls to the soviet union was 
far exceeding atampts ability to carry them and proposed splitting 
future circuit increases between intelsat intersputnik and 
undersea cables 
atampt had sought permission from the fcc to build a new satellite 
antenna at atampts roaring creek earth station near catawissa pa 
to transmit calls to an intersputnik satellite above the west coast 
of africa the fcc has not acted on the application 
atampt said the soviet union preferred to use its own satellite 
system for additional phone circuits because moscow then incurs 
expenses solely within the soviet union payable in rubles rather 
than in western currencies 
rubles are not traded officially in international money markets 
intersputnik is a consortium of 15 formerly communist countries 
that provides satellitedelivered communications among its member 
nations

german unification could raise interest rates 
in the united states by at least a full percentage point after 
1992 a congressional study released wednesday said 
the congressional joint economic committee which requested the 
study said in a statement that if germany finances higher 
government spending with higher borrowing real shortterm interest 
rates are estimated to be a full percentage point higher in the 
1990s in the united states 
the study by the congressional budget office projected that 
the interest rate hike in the united states could be 06 percent 
next year 09 percent by 1992 1 percent by 1993 and 11 percent 
by 1994 
the study said that if the german government helps its new 
eastern states with tax money there would be little international 
effect but chancellor helmut kohl recently won the first election 
since unification after a promise not to raise taxes higher taxes 
would replace higher borrowing 
the committee said that much of the money the united states 
borrows comes from the savings of germans that borrowed money goes 
to cover the deficit in the federal budget and to pay for imports 
if the german government borrows more of its peoples savings for 
its own purposes interest rates could rise in both countries 
german government borrowing could have other effects too the 
study said it found that in 1992 it could cause a small drop in 
american production and a potential increase in us exports of 
159 billion 
the report pointed out that the reduction of the military threat 
from eastern europe could save the united states money on defense 
but did not offer a figure the study did not cover the soviet 
union itself 
the transformation of eastern europe should have its most 
significant impact on the us economy in two ways by slightly 
raising us interest rates and by enabling lower defense 
expenditures a peace dividend arising from the end of the cold 
war the study said 
exports to eastern europe could increase by as much as 6 
billion in 1994 it estimated

the bush administration said wednesday that 
us allies have contributed more than 9 billion to support the 
american military campaign against iraq and we are satisfied 
several members of congress have criticized the allies 
contribution as inadequate for example sen jim sasser dtenn 
said in an article in the new york times that saudi arabia was 
reaping a windfall profit of some 150 million a day in increased 
oil sales and have contributed only 987 million in cash and 
material equivalent to about 65 days worth of those profits 
the state department in releasing the 9billion figure 
declined to specify how much saudi arabia or any other individual 
members of the makeshift alliance had contributed to defense of the 
saudi oilfields germany and japan also have been targets of 
congressional criticism 
yes we are satisfied richard boucher a state department 
spokesman said of course this is a continuing effort and we 
will expect continuing contributions from ourselves as well as 
other nations that are involved in this effort 
on a related subject boucher said theres been no sign of 
movement from iraq in a dispute with the administration over 
arrangements for secretary of state james a ho is chairman of the senate 
budget committee said 
japan had pledged 4 billion to the gulf effort and had paid 374 
million through nov 30 germany he said had offered 900 million 
and paid 330 million 
the pentagon said last week it would ask congress for up to 20 
billion to maintain operation desert shield the projected cost 
through the end of this year is 82 billion 
sasser said a fullscale shooting war could cost the united 
states 1 billion to 2 billion a day

personality tests used by some businesses to 
assess job applicants are backed by flawed research that generally 
fails to demonstrate the tests predict job performance two experts 
said 
we see precious little evidence that even the best personality 
tests predict job performance wrote steve blinkhorn and charles 
johnson 
they are directors of psychometric research amp development 
limited of st albans hertfordshire england which designs and 
tests assessment systems for businesses their commentary appears 
in thursdays issue of the british journal nature 
the analysis was criticized by american psychologists and test 
publishers who said the research shows the tests can predict 
aspects of job performance 
the two also said many american companies avoid personality 
tests anyway because of skepticism privacy issues and the 
requirements of federal antidiscrimination guidelines 
in the nature paper blinkhorn and johnson discussed their 
informal survey of research on the prediction power of three 
personality tests used for employee selection and assessment 
in reporting correlations between test performance and later job 
performance the studies generally used an inappropriate 
statistical approach blinkhorn said in a telephone interview a 
more appropriate analysis of the research results blinkhorn said 
suggests that most of the time the tests are doing no better than 
chance 
but that analysis overlooked successful predictions because it 
did not look at how particular personality characteristics relate 
to particular aspects of job performance said psychologist leaetta 
hough 
if you analyze what it is youre trying to predict there are 
sensible relationships between personality and those performance 
factors said hough who has studied personality tests in 
employment settings 
the predictions are not perfect but they can indicate such 
factors as willingness to work hard striving for outstanding 
results dependability and satisfying clients said hough 
executive vice president of the personnel decisions research 
institute in minneapolis 
she and other experts stressed that personality tests should not 
be used by themselves for personnel decisions but rather as part 
of a package of information about a person

american troops will not be ready to 
attack iraq until weeks after the jan 15 un deadline for saddam 
hussein to withdraw from kuwait the deputy commander of us 
forces in the persian gulf said wednesday 
some crucial heavy ground forces likely will not even have 
arrived in saudi arabia by the deadline and commanders are urging 
president bush to delay any offensive action until the deployment 
is completed army lt gen calvin ah waller said 
if saddam ignores the deadline and bush wants to order an attack 
in the days immediately following jan 15 id tell him no im 
not ready to do the job the general said 
waller said he believed bush was aware of the readiness 
timetable but said it would be stressed again in three days of 
meetings that began wednesday between field commanders and bushs 
top two military officials defense secretary dick cheney and 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff colin powell 
bush said monday that un resolutions against iraq which 
include one authorizing force if iraqi troops arent out of kuwait 
by jan 15 should be enforced right on schedule 
at the white house presidential press secretary marlin 
fitzwater said wednesday when asked about wallers comments what 
he really said is they might not be as ready as they would like to 
be for all the contingencies 
we are assured they will be ready to do whatever they are 
called upon to do fitzwater said 
in saudi arabia aides to powell and to wallers immediate boss 
gen h norman schwarzkopf expressed concern that waller had been 
too candid in discussing us readiness and deployment in his 
meeting with reporters just after an initial meeting with cheney 
and powell 
speaking privately several senior military officials suggested 
that his comments could undermine diplomatic efforts based on 
persuading saddam to take the jan 15 deadline seriously 
cheney fired former air force chief of staff gen michael dugan 
in september after dugan talked openly of the likelihood of bombing 
certain iraqi military and economic targets if hostilities began 
waller was the first senior military officer to say publicly 
that the american deployment will reach 430000 troops when 
completed but he said several vital components still were missing 
including navy carriers due to leave home port just after 
christmas combat aircraft due to arrive by jan 15 and some 
117000 army armored forces coming from fort riley kan and from 
germany 
some of the latter group waller said might not arrive until 
late january and even if the troops did arrive by the un 
deadline he said theres a distinct possibility that every unit 
will not be fully combat ready until sometime after the first of 
february 
likening himself to a football coach waller said 
i certainly want everything that i can possibly get and have 
at my side of the field when i get ready to go into the super bowl 
i would say to the president and to the secretary and as well 
to the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff that until our full 
complement of forces are on the ground that we should not initiate 
hostile activities 
of bush waller said its my understanding that hes been 
briefed and received briefings that the forces will not be ready 
for combat activity until sometime after the 15th of the month 
in washington meanwhile 
sens ted stevens ralaska and daniel inouye dhawaii said 
that on their justconcluded trip to the gulf us military 
commanders indicated a war with iraq could be wrapped up within 
five days the senators commented after briefing bush on their trip 
but declined to say if the president shared their assessment 
white house spokesman fitzwater said there had been no new 
contact with iraq on dates or times for the proposed visit of 
secretary of state james a baker iii to baghdad or the white house 
visit by iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz we get no response 
we dont see any opening fitzwater said 
the state department said us allies had contributed more 
than 9 billion to support the american gulf effort and we are 
satisfied several members of congress have criticized the 
allies contribution as too small 
the white house announced that vice president dan quayle will 
visit the us troops in the gulf on a dec 29jan 2 trip during 
which he will also meet with saudi king fahd 
in saudi arabia cheney and powell had nothing to say publicly 
wednesday after the initial round of meetings speaking to 
reporters en route to saudi arabia however cheney said concerning 
the jan 15 date most of the forces will be there by then but 
obviously there is additional work to be done before you would 
identify them as combat ready 
as for saddams intentions cheney said he saw no evidence that 
the iraqi president planned even a partial withdrawal from kuwait 
a move some have suggested he might make in an effort to weaken the 
international coalition demanding a total pullout 
he might move the pieces around on the board but our 
objective is for him to get all of that stuff out of kuwait not 
half of it not 75 percent of it not 10 percent of it all of 
it cheney said 
powell said he did not want to discuss any us combat plans 
because doing so could help saddam 
i want him to sit there in beautiful downtown baghdad and 
worry his butt off about it powell said 
cheney and powell are to meet with american and saudi military 
officers thursday and friday morning before splitting up to make 
prechristmas visits to some of the 270000 us troops already in 
the gulf region

breast cancers may recruit normal tissue to help

scientists identified a gene that is activated in normal cells 
surrounding invasive breast cancers spurring the normal cells to 
produce an enzyme that may help cancer cells spread from the 
original tumor 
the makeup of the gene suggests that this enzyme may degrade 
normal tissue surrounding a tumor creating pathways for the cancer 
cells to escape scientists reported in thursdays issue of the 
british journal nature 
the enzyme which the scientists dubbed stromelysin3 is 
produced by stromal cells which make up supporting structure 
within breasts the scientists said 
apparently breast cancers produce some kind of substance that 
activates the stromal cells to produce the enzyme they suggested 
the enzyme may be a new target for cancer therapy they said 
the work was reported by pierre chambon and colleagues at the 
institute of biological chemistry of the national institute of 
medical research in strasbourg france 
dr lance liotta a national cancer institute expert on how 
cancer spreads said it was unclear what the discovery means for 
cancer treatment for one thing nobody knows whether the enzyme 
really helps cancers spread or whether it provides a defense he 
said wednesday 
liotta said scientists had previously identified other enzymes 
that help cancers spread by destroying tissue these substances are 
created by cancer cells themselves he said

market prices of major farm commodities will 
be mixed in the coming year as some rise because of declining 
supplies while others decline because of abundance the agriculture 
department said wednesday 
a new outlook report by the departments economic research 
service said world output of grain oilseeds and meat is rising in 
199091 
consumption however is forecast to grow more oderately and 
ending stocks of some commodities are expected to rise the 
report said 
in the united states the average prices in the 199091 
marketing years for various crops will show a variety of reactions 
the average prices of wheat milk barley oats and rice are 
expected to be lower than a year earlier while the prices of corn 
soybeans and most meats will hold about steady or rise slightly 
the report said 
meanwhile the mix of crops farmers plant in 1991 will probably 
change more than in recent years it said 
farmers will be reacting to the planting flexibility 
provisions of the new farm law and will be more responsive to 
changing market prices the report said if yields revert to 
trend and planted acreage remains steady foreign grain output 
could decline as well perhaps lending some support to prices

united nations the united states on wednesday appeared close 
to endorsing un security council efforts to protect arabs in the 
israelioccupied lands denounce their deportation and back a 
mideast peace conference 
the security council has been holding intensive consultations to 
avert a us veto and to reconcile western and nonaligned draft 
resolutions 
us officials are trying to find a way out of a diplomatic 
vise squeezing them between their longstanding ties to israel and 
their newfound attachment to arab allies in the antiiraqi 
coalition 
western diplomats said wednesday that agreement on a finnish 
draft resolution that could be supported by the united states 
appeared to be at hand although some textual problems remained 
nonaligned diplomats indicated that more serious problems may 
remain 
us ambassador thomas r pickering told reporters wednesday 
after consultations that the united states could vote in favor of a 
draft resolution submitted by finland in its integrity but 
amendments were expected 
a security council meeting and vote was rescheduled to thursday 
morning it has been delayed seven times the past two weeks 
largely at us urging 
the united states is trying to avoid exercising its veto of a 
resolution critical of israel which fiercely opposes an 
international mideast conference us officials fear a veto which 
they can exercise as a permanent council member would anger arab 
allies and thus undermine the antiiraqi coalition 
the united states has been trying to remove any mention of a 
mideast peace conference from a resolution and shift it to a 
nonbinding presidential statement accompanying the resolution 
complicating matters us officials also want to avoid any 
appearance of bowing to iraqs demand that a persian gulf 
settlement be tied to a solution of the palestinian problem iraqi 
president saddam hussein has called for a mideast peace conference 
the us government which supports considering a peace 
conference at an unspecified time in the future has disavowed any 
linkage between iraqioccupied kuwait invaded on aug 2 and the 
israelioccupied lands

leaders of the palestinian uprising on 
wednesday called a strike in bethlehem for christmas eve but 
israeli officials said governmentsponsored holiday programs would 
go on as scheduled 
a palestinian strike which would close all of bethlehems 
tourist shops and restaurants on dec 24 will make for a gloomy 
gloomy christmas admitted tourism ministry spokesman yossi 
shoval 
but he added there will be no change in our christmas 
events with or without their support 
the main governmentsponsored event on christmas eve is an 
evening choir performance in bethlehem which is in the occupied 
west bank religious activitis include a procession into the 
church of the nativity led by the roman catholic patriarch of 
jerusalem a protestant prayer service in nearby shepherds field 
and midnight mass 
the israeli army posts hundreds of troops in bethlehem at 
christmas to man roadblocks and metal detectors that visitors must 
pass through to reach the church where christian tradition says 
christ was born 
it is the fourth consecutive year that the underground 
palestinian leadership has called a strike in bethlehem to 
underscore the uprising against israeli occupation of the west bank 
and gaza strip 
the leaflet calling the strike said it was also due to the 
gulf crisis many palestinians support iraqi president saddam 
hussein 
earlier bethlehem mayor elias freij said the municipality would 
cancel traditional christmas parades and receptions again this year 
in solidarity with the uprising 
bishop samir kafity the anglican bishop of jerusalem told a 
meeting of visiting american christian leaders on wednesday he 
understood the frustration of his fellow palestinians 
how can we celebrate the birth of the prince of peace if we 
have no sign of this peace coming he said 
he predicted more soldiers than worshipers in bethlehem at 
christmas 
shoval said the tourism ministry expects about 7000 people to 
visit bethlehem this holiday season onethird fewer than last year 
and down sharply from before the uprising began 
considering the gulf crisis its an okay number he said 
several american hungarian and german church choirs that were 
expected to perform on christmas eve in bethlehem have canceled 
their trips apparently out of concern about the gulf crisis other 
ministry officials said 
the only two currently scheduled to perform are the chancel 
choir of the first united methodist church of oklahoma city and 
jerusalems living stones community choir

americas compassion for the hungry and 
homeless is losing ground to hostility and frustration over 
problems that wont go away and will only get worse the united 
states conference of mayors said wednesday 
the conference in its report on hunger and homelessness in 
americas cities also warned of a growing gap between the plight 
of the needy and the resources to help them 
the survey of 30 cities found that requests for food aid were up 
22 percent in 1990 while demand for emergency shelter increased by 
24 percent by comparison emergency food resources were up only 4 
percent and available shelter beds increased by 3 percent 
the report compiled annually since 1985 cited insufficient 
lowincome housing inadequate care of the mentally ill illicit 
drugs and the weak economy for the increasing numbers of the 
desperately poor what is equally troubling it said is that 
americans are losing the will to care 
boston mayor raymond l flynn spoke at a news conference of the 
growing hostility toward those in need of a helping hand 
what should disturb the american people is the growing 
intolerance that too many people feel toward the social and 
economic problems that are facing americas cities and streets 
he said 
we as an american public dont reach out to help one another 
like we used to said mayor sue myrick of charlotte nc we 
dont share like we used to weve become a very selfish nation 
flynn and myrick are cochairs of the conferences task force on 
hunger and homelessness 
thirteen of the 30 cities surveyed reported negative changes in 
public attitudes toward the homeless and another seven said 
changes were both good and bad people are tired of the fact that 
the problem remains said officials in saint paul in a recent 
survey of local needs homelessness was noted by just one percent 
of the tally portland reported 
nine cities said they had taken actions to limit the access of 
the homeless to public areas new york recently banned panhandling 
in its subways because of frequent complaints from passengers 
peter smith president of partnership for the homeless a 
nationwide private shelter network said that while individual 
contributions to help the homeless are increasing he agreed with 
the mayors that substantial parts of the general public have lost 
patience with the failure of the public sector to address the 
problem 
smith said his group which has estimated the nationwide 
homeless population at 2 million is urging churches synagogues 
public facilities and private office buildings to open their doors 
to the homeless during the holiday season 
among the findings 
thirteen cities said emergency food facilities cant meet 
demand requests for food cant be met 14 percent of the time 
threefourths of the cities said people relied on emergency rations 
as a steady source of food 
most food banks are able to supply only enough food to last a 
family for one to two days even with other sources of income and 
support this is not sufficient to provide an adequate amount of 
food seattle officials said 
soup kitchens in 86 percent of the cities must on occasion turn 
people away some sites are having to close down for several days 
a month when food supplies run out according to cleveland 
officials 
shelters in 70 percent of the cities must turn away homeless 
families nineteen perent of requests go unmet the average 
increase in requests for shelter was 24 percent ranging from 142 
percent in charleston which was hit be hurricane hugo to 50 
percent in charlotte and between 5 and 10 percent in chicago 
louisville phoenix and saint paul 
single men comprised 51 percent of the homeless families with 
children make up 34 percent and single women 12 percent the cities 
reported that 46 percent of the homeless population is black 34 
percent is white 15 percent is hispanic 3 percent is native 
american and 1 percent is asian 
people considered mentally ill account for 28 percent of the 
homeless substance abusers make up 38 percent and 6 percent were 
reported to have aids or hivrelated illness 
flynn noted that the number of people in state mental 
institutions dropped from 505000 in 1955 to less than 118000 
today and that many of these people with no place to go were 
sentenced to americas streets grates doorways and park 
benches 
he said the federal budget for subsidized lowincome housing has 
trickled down to almost nothing over the past decade another 
reason more people are without homes 
the federal government has walked away now with the states 
downturn in their economies they are walking away so the cities 
are getting a doublewhammy the cities are dealing with the 
problem alone 
we havent dealt with the basic social problems in this 
country for a long time myrick said anything we do in putting 
money into homeless shelters is a bandaid approach 
eightyseven percent of the cities used locally generated 
revenues to finance aid to the homeless ranging from 26000 in 
new orleans to 131 million in new york all accepted federal funds 
from the mckinney homeless assistance act going from 23000 in 
san juan to 36 million in new york

the labor official mohamed titna alaoui regional secretary in 
fez for the general union of moroccan workers could face a 
fiveyear prison he is charged with inciting rebellion and 
spreading false information lawyers from three human rights groups 
are representing him 
rioting broke out in fez and other cities on friday during a 
oneday nationwide general strike for higher wages the strike was 
called by alaouis federation and another labor group 
the government says five people were killed but unions and 
human rights activists put the death toll at more than 30 one of 
the charges against alaoui is that he gave exaggerated information 
about the number of deaths 
about 200 people were arrested in fez during the riots and 
officials said 52 of them would appear in court this week dozens 
more have begun appearing in court in rabat and tangier where

officials and lawmakers from various parties the opposition has 
rejected the plan saying the commission should be completely 
independent of the executive branch 
the severity of the rioting has been widely attributed to 
poverty in moroccos cities many rioters were young people who 
according to opposition leaders are frustrated by the lack of job 
opportunities

the military establishment has been shaken by a 
widening investigation into the israeli air force involving 
millions of dollars in suspected graft from purchases of us 
military equipment 
brig gen rami dotan once in charge of israels military 
purchases in the united states and an air force colonel already 
are under arrest news reports wednesday said more arrests were 
expected 
leading officers appeared wednesday on israel television to 
discuss the case which involves suspected bribes and diversion of 
equipment they called it a crushing blow to the militarys elite 
air corps which is regarded as the first line of defense for 
israel 
chief of staff lt gen dan shomron said the charges if true 
amounted to treason he pledged a thorough investigation adding 
we shall go until the end and cleanse this dirt from out midst 
ezer weizman a former defense minister and air force chief 
said that if the charges were true dotan had harmed national 
security it is as though 100 planes had been shot down 
weizman said in interviews with israel television and radio 
dotan one of the highestranking officers ever questioned in a 
weapons scandal was arrested in october and resigned as air force 
chief of logistics 
as is normal under the israeli justice system no charges have 
been brought because the investigation against him is not complete 
but public anger over the alleged corruption heightened this 
week with news reports that a plea bargain was in the works that 
could limit full disclosure of the corruption two leading 
newspapers argued in editorials against any such deal 
the military spokesmans office declined comment on the case 
the allegations against dotan follow several cases of 
exofficers or reserve officers playing a role in illegal arms 
deals 
reserve army lt col yair klein was convicted last month of 
illegally selling arms and military expertise in colombia klein 
claims he was helping farmers fight leftwing rebels but the 
colombian government has charged he armed and trained drug 
traffickers 
one accusation against dotan is that he swindled the air force 
out of money and equipment according to israel television 
millions of dollars worth of spare parts and equipment recenlt 
purchased by the force never reached their destination the 
television said 
since his arrest dotan has been questioned about pocketing up 
to 10 million in bribes in procuring air force equipment in the 
united states newspapers have reported 
much of the alleged fraud was committed while dotan headed the 
defense ministrys acquisition delegation in new york in 19841985 
the reports said 
the yedioth ahronoth daily said the romanianborn dotan is an 
expert on fighter jet engines and also was involved in a recent 
decision in choosing between two wellknown american companies to 
supply engines for usmade f16 jets 
on tuesday a colonel in dotans unit not formally identified 
in public documents was arrested and ordered held on suspicion he 
received privileges from dotan in exchange for keeping quiet 
about the alleged fraud news reports said 
dozens of others were being questioned and more arrests were 
expected the reports added 
israeli media also said it was suspected that dotan plotted to 
attack another israeli who informed on the racketeering to police 
last summer 
yedioth quoted an unidentified sergeant as saying dotan offered 
to pay him 50000 to silence ofer pail a former employee of 
the defense ministry acquisitions office in new york 
military analyst ron benishai wrote in yedioth that the 
military was uneasy about the scandals possible effect on us 
military aid of 18 billion a year a large chunk of which goes to 
the air force

president fidel castro of cuba said wednesday 
that layoffs are needed to cope with his governments economic 
squeeze the official cuban news agency reported 
for years cuba has suffered from a us trade embargo now 
bargainrate soviet oil supplies are being curtailed and money to 
tap alternate sources is short 
in an address to more than 350 foreign university students 
castro referred to the problems in procuring enough oil for his 
caribbean island 
for now we have things arranged but one has to think about a 
more critical era castro was quoted as saying by prensa latina 
monitored in mexico city 
it would be necessary to reduce labor activity in some plaes 
without failing to assure a salary to the affected workers 
the report did not quote the communist leader as specifying the 
number of layoffs he believes will be necessary nor was any date 
given 
soviet officials have threatened phased reduction of overall 
economic aid to cuba which reportedly accounts for 4 billion to 
5 billion a year 
us sources say a marked decline in soviet purchases of cuban 
sugar at prices substantially higher than world market levels has 
reduced another form of subsidy for cubas economy

the federal trade commission on wednesday 
approved a swiss pharmaceutical companys acquisition of a leading 
us biotechnology firm but required the swiss concern to issue 
us licenses for its patents for aids treatment 
the commission said acquisition of controlling interest in 
genentech inc of south san francisco calif by roche holding 
ltd might substantially lessen competition in the us market for 
cd4based therapeutics for the treatment of aids 
it told roche that for 10 years it must grant us license under 
its patents for cd4based therapeutics to anyone who requests a 
license 
the vote was 31 on a consent agreement that allowed the 
acquisition while committing roche to modifying business 
arrangements with other companies 
commissioner deborah k owen dissenting said there were as 
yet no firms or products in the us market for such drugs and 
therefore drawing conclusions about competitive performance in 
that market in the relatively distant future is speculative at 
best 
commissioner andrew j strenio jr said he would have preferred 
securing relief apart from the consent agreement but agreed with 
the majority that there were sufficient grounds to give final 
approval to the consent agreement commissioner roscoe starek iii 
did not participate 
roche markets many pharmaceutical products in the united states 
and conducts extensive research and development in biotechnology 
the commission said its acquisition of genentech could also 
lessen competition in the world market for vitamin c and in the 
us market for therapeutic drugs that treat growth deficiency 
the commission which put the agreement on the public record for 
comment also required roche to either break up genentechs 
partnership with lubrizol which has researched and patented a new 
vitamin c process or dispose of the partnerships vitamin c 
assets 
a consent agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not 
amount to admission of a law violation

hunger disease war and years of 
economic hardship are ravaging the bodies of africas children and 
traumatizing their minds the un childrens fund said wednesday 
while the situation of children in much of the world has 
improved children in africa have quietly fallen victim often 
fatally to cuts in social spending and wars in which they are 
killed or turned into child killers the organization said 
at a ceremony to launch its 1991 report on the state of the 
worlds children the unicef director in the ivory coast malick 
sene listed statistics he said were a scandal and challenged 
the morality of a world tat allows such horrors sene is from 
mali 
he said africa is the only continent where social spending has 
been cut dramatically where most children never go to school and 
where most people wake daily to the fear of not finding enough 
food 
africa has the worlds highest rate of child deaths from easily 
preventable disease and infections more than onethird of the 15 
million deaths each year attributed to such causes nearly half the 
worlds 25 million refugees are african children and their mothers 
sene said africans have done little to combat such new social 
phenonena as the large numbers of street children created by 
poverty and urban migration and the deadly aids virus that in 
africa affects women and children in equal numbers to male victims 
most terrifying of all is the situation of children embroiled 
in conflicts despite themselves child soldiers child killers 
created by conflicts whose violence will produce incalculable 
traumas he said 
what can we say about the particularly sad scandal of refugee 
children for example scores of thousands just in our region 
today exploited children enslaved children children daily 
ravaged by famine and hunger while we talk of human rights for 
adults sene said 
such outrages against children pose a moral problem that unicef 
believes can be solved if developed countries keep their promises 
to improve the lives of the worlds children using money diverted 
from defense spending he said 
sene said unicef estimates the 20 billion needed to produce 
healthier children by the turn of the century amounts to just 10 
days of world expenditure on armies and munitions 
african governments particularly the military administrations 
that hold sway in west africa long have been criticized for 
allocating large amounts of their budgets for defense and little 
for social services 
health and social protection minister alain ekra of the ivory 
coast one of a handful of civilian governments in the region said 
the health of his relatively wealthy countrys children has 
deteriorated last year the ivory coast cut the ministrys budget 
by 30 percent 
the situation of children and women improved rapidly in the 
first two decades after our independence in 1960 thanks to

american drug agents have resumed raids on 
cocaine traffickers in perus jungle despite reported conflicts 
with the military the us embassy said wednesday 
army sources meanwhile denied that soldiers had interfered in 
american enforcement operations in the area 
us dea agents are attacking any target that arises an 
embassy spokesman said bad weather and vacations for the holidays 
are keeping the number of helicopter raids below normal levels the 
spokesman said on condition of anonymity 
drug enforcement administation chief robert bonner said tuesday 
in washington that agents had suspended operations in the upper 
huallaga valley because of interference by peruvian armed forces 
the dea and peruvian police operate a helicopter base in the 
valley the worlds main source of coca leaf the raw material for 
cocaine the valley is also a center of operations by perus two 
leftist rebel groups 
the washington post on wednesday reported the state department 
is considering removing peru from the list of countries cooperating 
with us antidrug efforts 
removing peru from the list would require the united states to 
cut off most of its aid to peru it would also require washington 
to oppose loans to peru by the international monetary fund and 
other multinational institutions 
presidential and foreign ministry officials said wednesday they 
had no comment on bonners statements 
an interior ministry spokesman denied the armed forces had ever 
interfered with dea operations the spokesman said relations 
between the army and the antidrug police are normal 
the interior ministry is in charge of peruvian police forces 
after taking office july 28 fujimori appointed active army 
officers to most top posts in the ministry 
an army officer at the military joint command also denied that 
soldiers had hindered dea raids in the huallaga 
if anything it is the dea that is interfering with army 
operations in the zone said the officer without elaborating he 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the united states and perus armed forces have often clashed 
over antidrug strategy in the huallaga 
peruvian officers have made clear they regard the guerrillas as 
a much greater threat than the drug traffickers political violence 
the past 10 years has claimed nearly 20000 lives 
the military believes antidrug operations in the valley could 
push local peasants into the rebel ranks some 200000 peruvians 
are thought to be involved in growing and processing coca 
the rebels provide protection to the drug traffickers in 
exchange for guns and money police and peasants in the area say 
in 1989 us officials accused the army general in charge of 
antirebel operations in the huallaga of allowing drug traffickers 
to operate in the region the general was later transferred 
in september fujimori refused to accept 36 million in us 
military aid to fight drug trafficking he said peru needs more 
economic aid to help the peasants who grow coca leaves

nasa scientists pretending to be 
explorers from another world said wednesday they had concluded life 
exists on earth and it may be intelligent 
the scientists based their conclusinon on data from the 
jupiterbound galileo spacecraft 
the accumulated evidence we have would give your 
hypothetical explorer a very strong indication you had biological 
activity on earth said torrence johnson galileos chief 
scientist at the jet propulsion laboratory 
galileos study of earth illustrates how researchers use data 
collected by spacecraft to reach conclusions about other planets 
galileo boomeranged past earth and the moon dec 8 using the 
planets gravity as a slingshot to speed it up and expand its orbit 
around the sun so it can reach jupiter in 1995 
scientists used the opportunity to treat earth as an alien 
planet ordering galileo to snap a few thousand pictures and make 
numerous measurements they outlined their findings during a 
wednesday news conference 
measurements made by galileos infrared lightdetecting 
instrument showed earths atmosphere is rich in nitrous oxide 
methane and oxygen indicating theres a lot of life on the 
planet said laboratory scientist robert w carlson 
another of galileos instruments picked up nonnatural radio 
signals that got stronger closer to the planet which would make 
alien scientists strongly suspect earth has intelligent life that 
makes radio broadcasts johnson said 
the spaceship also detected lightning bolts made measurements 
to help explain creation of the northern and southern lights 
determined the planet is warmed by a mild greenhouse effect and 
detected a highaltitude ice cloud that helps cause the annual hole 
in the protective ozone layer over antarctica 
on the moon galileo found evidence of a huge volcanic eruption 
4 billion years ago that shows such volcanic activity occurred 
about 200 million years earlier than previously believed said 
brown university geologist jim head 
the spacecrafts pictures also confirmed the existence of a 
1200milewide meteorite impact basin on the southern hemisphere 
of the moons far side the largest such crater ever identified 
head said 
the national aeronautics and space administration released nine 
more of galileos photos of the earth and moon wednesday 
one was a mosaic assembled from 11 separate pictures showing 
all of icy antarctica others showed huge lunar craters a color 
map of minerals on the moons surface clouds swirling over south 
america and australias larger lakes and great barrier reef 
the pictures didnt display evidence of life on earth because 
galileos closest approach to the planet at a distance of 597 
miles was over the southwest atlantic ocean the detail in the 
pictures was inadequate to reveal buildings scientists said 
nasa also displayed two short movies made by assembling 
hundreds of galileos still photos showing the earth and moon 
spinning 
top that ted turner head declared after the colorized 
lunar movie was played he was referring to media mogul turners 
controversial practice of colorizing classic films 
also wednesday galileo fired its thrusters repeatedly to aim 
itself properly for its close encounter with the asteroid gaspra 
next oct 29 said project manager bill oneil 
galileo will swing past earth again dec 8 1992 for a final 
gravity slingshot maneuver to help it reach jupiter in july 
1995 galileo will separate into an orbiter and a probe both will 
reach jupiter in december 1995 
the probe will descend into jupiters atmosphere returning data 
to the orbiter until the probe is crushed by intense atmospheric 
pressure the orbiter will circle jupiter for at least two years 
studying the planet and making closeup pictures of its 10 largest 
moons

nasa has lost the glamour that once attracted 
top people to its ranks and the agency is now not competitive with 
industry and academia in hiring of the best and brightest 
according to a federal report released wednesday 
contrary to the popular saying at nasa you do have to be a 
rocket scientist to fill many of its demanding positions said 
the final full report of the advisory committee on the future of 
the us space program 
the study said that the excitement of working for nasa has faded 
and that the space agency in its hiring now is not competitive 
for experienced engineers and senior technicallyqualified 
managers 
but to get such people nasa now loses out to worldclass 
industrial and academic institutions seeking the same sort of 
talent the report said 
in the past the challenge and excitement of the space program 
has been a significant inducement for exactly the type of people 
one wishes to attract said the report recently however it 
said criticism of the space program and its participants and the 
image of public service in general have made nasa a less 
attractive employer 
because of these problems the committee said it was not 
confident that in the future nasa will be able to obtain or 
retain the necessary cadre of skilled personnel in a field where 
the most critical asset is the talent of the individual 
participants 
the 12member advisory committee was appointed four months ago 
to study the civil space program and to make recommendations to 
vice president dan quayle and to nasa administrator richard truly 
a summary of the report was released last week the full report was 
issued wednesday 
to help nasa attract special skills the committee called for 
reforms in civil service regulations that would allow the agency to 
pay higher salaries for specific skills and to give more 
flexibility in establishing pay schedules in certain circumstances 
among the other recommendations of the committee were 
reduce reliance on the space shuttle and the development of 
new unmanned launch vehicles to put satellites and other equipment 
into orbit 
redesign space station freedom with a goal of reducing costs 
and complexity the space station mission the committee said 
should center on life sciences and human space operations and less 
on industrial process research 
science should be given the highest priority in the space 
program and science activities should be maintained at or above 20 
percent of the nasa budget 
nasa should not build a fifth space shuttle but keep the fleet 
at four after the new orbiter endeavour is delivered next year 
a longterm program should be established to carry out president 
bushs goal of establishing a permanent base on the moon and the 
human exploration of the planet mars along with an effort to 
produce significant advances in space transportation and life 
sciences 
bush has said he wanted the mars landing by 2019 but the 
committee said the schedule should be designed to match the 
availability of federal funds 
a project to study the planet earth from orbit should be 
initiated and continued over several decades rather than a 
mission whose design is frozen in time

protesting all week it was in timisoara one year ago that the 
countrys popular revolution began 
in bucharest several hundred students demonstrated outside the 
state television building in support of dumitru iuga head of the 
free tv union iuga has been on a hunger strike for 19 days 
demanding the ouster of television executives left over from the 
communist dictatorship

were subject to long delays as employees of the state airline tarom 
continued their strike 
the independent daily romania libera said the navigators union 
from the black sea port of constanta called for a general strike as 
a sign of solidarity with students who are boycotting classes 
it did not say when such a strike would begin or if there had been 
any positive response from workers 
in timisoara student strikers have been joined by about 50000 
workers from 11 area factories 
union leaders in the city said wednesday that 16 more factories 
had joined the warning strike they did not say how many workers 
the factories employed 
meanwhile a delegation from the nonparliamentary opposition 
civic alliance met with iliescu to press demands for the formation 
of a government of national unity 
marian munteanu a prominent student leader who was elected 
temporary president of the civic alliance last week said he was 
very satisfied with the talks 
national liberal party leader radu campeanu urged the formation 
of a unity government in talks with the president last thursday 
campeanu asked iliescu to replace premier petre roman with a 
neutral person not affiliated with the national salvation front 
the front which includes former communist officials ruled 
provisionally until may when it won free elections critics say 
the government has failed to resolve the nations economic woes 
there has been growing public dissatisfaction with the 
government as economic reforms including price increases have 
taken effect 
roman in line with his program of sweeping economic reform 
designed to create a market economy urged parliament wednesday to 
expedite a law granting farmers and peasants ownership of the land 
they cultivate thus disbanding the state farms set up under 
communist rule 
the law would give peasants the land they work and the right to 
buy more however no one would be permitted to own more than 250 
acres 
last years revolution ousted dictator nicolae ceausescu who 
was executed on christmas day along with his wife elena

a judge honored a prosecutors request and 
dismissed charges wednesday against a man accused of sexually 
assaulting a woman with 46 personalities 
prosecutor joseph paulus said he asked that charges against mark 
peterson be dismissed after consulting with multiple personality 
experts and determining a retrial would be harmful to the victim 
circuit judge robert hawley overturned petersons nov 8 
conviction on sexual assault charges earlier this week because the 
defense had not been allowed to have a psychiatrist examine the 
woman before trial 
paulus whose handling of the case has been widely criticized 
said even though he wont reprosecute peterson he was satisfied 
justice was done 
the jury verdict although now set aside on a legal 
technicality sent a strong message to the community that mentally 
ill individuals in our society must be protected from those who 
prey upon them he said 
the lawyer for the 27yearold woman who suffers from multiple 
personality disorder and has 46 personalities said his client 
wanted another trial to ensure that her attacker went to jail but 
he advised her against it 
right now we are trying to get her to a doctor who can give 
her some longterm care said the lawyer george curtis she 
has been able to get only some free treatment that is available 
through government and it is infrequent 
hawley accepted the prosecutors recommendation and dismissed 
the charge of seconddegree sexual assault against peterson 29 of 
oshkosh 
the decision clears peterson an exgrocery store bagger of any 
criminal wrongdoing in taking the woman out on a coffee date and 
having sex with her june 11 in his car two days after they met 
it is a crime in wisconsin for someone to have sex with a 
mentally ill person who cannot understand the consequences of their 
actions the perpetrator must also know the person is mentally ill 
in convicting peterson the jury accepted paulus arguments that 
peterson knew of the womans mental illness and manipulated one of 
her personalities to have sex with her 
peterson would not comment after wednesdays dismissal of the 
charge his attorney mary lou robinson called on paulus to 
publicly apologize for bringing the case to trial 
paulus said the prosecution of the case was legitimate and 
claimed ms robinson was trying to exploit the situation for 
petersons gain 
the trial in which the woman testified as six different 
personalities attracted international attention and raised new 
questions about sexual consent and mental illness 
curtis the womans lawyer said the stress and publicity 
surrounding the trial has caused his clients mental illness to 
worsen 
since the case became public the victims personalities have 
grown from 18 to 46 police have been called to her home after she 
reported one personality was trying to kill her

the federal reserve amidst fresh evidence of 
a weakening economy lowered another key interest rate on 
wednesday analysts said the bush administration said it expected 
banks to follow the feds lead to rejuvenate consumer borrowing 
but there was no rush to do so 
economists said the central bank injected reserves into the 
banking system to push the federal funds rate the interest that 
banks charge to make loans to each other down by point to 7 
percent a day earlier the fed cut its discount rate the interest 
it charges for direct loans to commercial banks from 7 percent to 
65 percent the first reduction in four years 
the feds action came as the commerce department lowered its 
already low estimate of the economys pace in the julyseptember 
quarter putting the annual rate of growth in the gross national 
product at an anemic 14 percent 
analysts said the downward revision in the gnp report showed 
that the country was facing severe difficulty even before the 
iraqs invasion of kuwait battered the economy with soaring energy 
prices 
many economists were looking for the fourth quarter gnp report 
to signal the start of a recession with some guessing that the 
contraction of output during the period could be as sharp as a 35 
percent drop in gnp at an annual rate 
they base that estimate on a torrent of dismal economic news 
during the period from rising unemployment to falling industrial 
production and weak consumer sales 
it is these statistics that are prompting to the fed to 
aggressively ease interest rates in the hopes that lower borrowing 
costs will spur such interestrate sensitive sectors of the economy 
as housing and car sales 
economists said that the reduction in the funds rate engineered 
but not publicly confirmed by the fed on wednesday amounted to 
only a 025 percentage point cut it would be the fourth 
quarterpoint cut in the funds rate that the fed has spurred in the 
past two months 
on wednesday the fed cut its discount rate the interest it 
charges to make direct loans to commercial banks from 7 percent to 
65 percent 
while a cut in the discount rate is the most dramatic signal 
that the central bank can send of its desire to fight a slumping 
economy with lower interest rates changes in the funds rate are 
considered just as crucial because of the impact they have on 
banks cost of funds 
normally the credit easing moves the fed has made would be 
enough to spur banks to slash their benchmark prime lending rate 
which is used as the basis for calculating many consumer and 
business loans 
however the countrys major banks who have been facing severe 
losses on bad real estate loans this year showed no move toward 
making such a cut wednesday although analysts said they still 
expected a reduction within days the prime lending rate has been 
stuck at 10 percent since last january 
the bush administration let it be known that it expected banks 
to do their part to spur a flagging economy presidential spokesman 
marlin fitzwater said that while a reduction in the prime rate was 
a market decision it was normal that a discountrate cut 
reverberates through the system 
the commerce department gnp report continued to revise downward 
economic growth for the third quarter it initially estimated 
growth during this period at 18 percent in october but revised 
that to 17 percent a month later 
the gnp is the nations total output of goods and services and 
its broadest measure of economic health 
economist kermit baker of cahners economics in newton mass 
said the downward revision is a trajectory of where the economy 
is headed it indicates the fourth quarter will be a lot weaker 
than the third 
bruce steinberg an economist with merrill lynch capital markets 
in new york agreed noting other government reports show the 
economy is falling rather rapidly in the fourth quarter and will 
continue to fall during the first part of 1991 
highlighting the continuing deterioration the department also 
reported on wednesday that construction of singlefamily houses in 
november dropped to a level not seen since the 198182 recession 
even though the overall construction figure rose by 93 percent 
solely because of a big increase in multifamily building 
the government reported wednesday that a gnp measure of 
inflation was unchanged at an annual rate of 42 percent in the 
third quarter that measure was expected to rise significantly 
faster in the final three months of the year given what energy 
prices did following iraqs invasion of kuwait 
contributing most to the downward revision in thirdquarter gnp 
growth was weaker consumer spending and a wider trade deficit than 
first estimated 
consumer spending was revised from a 36 percent annual rate of 
growth to just 27 percent while the nations trade deficit 
increase was boosted to 19 billion more than three times higher 
than last months estimate

christmas doesnt seem much like a season 
of goodwill and peace for the dwindling band of christian civilians 
in persian gulf countries close to the kuwait crisis zone 
a childrens choir delighted audiences in manama with 
traditional carols but their conductor had to keep whispering 
smile smile to the grimfaced kids as they sang 
dear father christmas we want you to know 
wed like to build a snowman but we havent any snow 
we want just a little enough for one day 
and when weve built our snowman you can take the rest away 
it was appropriate for bahrains balmy winter where snow is 
seen only on christmas cards or in movies 
the children may now see the real stuff earlier than they 
thought 
many western expatriate workers are sending their families to 
europe or north america for christmas and few of the families 
expect to come back soon 
many bought air tickets weeks ago but hadnt decided whether to 
use them 
now with britain advising british dependents to quit bahrain 
qatar eastern saudi arabia riyadh and tabuk most are likely to 
leave 
some other westerners in bahrain will take their cue from their 
departure since the estimatd 4500 britons make up the largest 
western expatriate community here 
half the islands 500000 residents are expatriates with the 
bulk of them from asian countries 
washington is not advising the 750 us citizens in bahrain to 
leave it told them the island would be well protected in event of 
hostilities and americans would be helped if in danger 
the departures make it harder for the western families 
remaining schools tailored to the foreign communities lose 
teachers and some shut down 
putting dampening the holiday spirit was the bahrain 
governments decision to cancel celebrations on the dec 16 
national day citing the crisis following iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait 
in the past glittering streamers of electric lights put up for 
national day stayed up until the christian season ended this year 
no lights 
conductor richard chalkley told the adult choir at the dress 
rehearsal for the manama singers annual christmas concert they 
should try to look more upbeat 
try to smile a little bit he urged 
it wasnt easy the choir is down to 80 singers from more than 
100 and now their filipino pianist says shell probably go home 
too 
the remaining members fear they may lose more singers as the 
jan 15 un deadline approaches for iraq to leave kuwait thats 
also the date for the first rehearsal of the choirs new year 
season 
the swelling ranks of western military personnel are being 
showered with gifts and attention from back home as dec 25 
approaches 
when the choir toured manamas hotels singing carols it was 
joined by servicemen in crewcuts who helped belt out christmas 
favorites 
in one hotel almost the entire audience was made up of puzzled 
kuwaiti exiles in long white robes their quizzical expressions 
dissolved after a rousing rendition of rudolph the rednosed 
reindeer 
bahrain has a more relaxed attitude toward the christian 
festivities than neighboring saudi arabia where hundreds of 
thousands of western troops are deployed 
pine trees bearing christmas ornaments adorn manama hotel 
lobbies and offices 
christmas music is played on bahrain radio 
the only restriction formerly was a tacit ban on use of the word 
christmas the term has been coming into the open lately 
splashed across posters in hotels 
christmas cards are openly on sale but some bear distinctly 
unpeaceful messages this year one shows santa with his sleigh team 
in the desert with a row of tanks in the background 
most of the customers at shopping centers seem to be offduty 
troops one gift displayed in stores is a tshirt with the words 
i survived bahrain 1990

president francois mitterrand said wednesday that a 
peaceful settlement of the persian gulf crisis is still possible 
and france isnt prohibited from taking initiatives to avoid 
war 
but he told a news conference that if iraqs intransigence makes 
war inevitable france will not fail to fulfill its historic 
duty 
he said france would participate if military action was launched 
against iraqi forces in accordance with un security council 
resolutions but he said france had no plans to increase its force 
in saudi arabia beyond the nearly 10000 troops now there or en 
route 
mitterrand expressed regret at the us opposition to a proposed 
security council resolution that would endorse the concept of an 
international conference on middle east problems including the 
israelipalestinian conflict 
were not fixing the date for next week mitterrand said 
but we think a conference would be an indispensable means of 
reconciling peoples 
iraqi president saddam hussein has said a settlement of the 
palestinian situation might prompt him to make concessions 
regarding kuwait which his troops have occupied since aug 2 
mitterrand suggested the proposed usiraqi talks were doomed 
because of a dispute over dates if it becomes definite that these 
talks will not occur he said france might take an initiative 
along with its european allies 
until the deadline one must hope that dialogues can take 
place here and there he said france in the open not acting 
in silence but in conformity with the uns objectives and in 
consultation with its western partners is not prohibited from 
taking initiatives of this type 
before jan 15 the security councils deadline for iraqi 
withdrawal from kuwait many things are possible mitterrand 
said its not forbidden to hope 
however mitterrand reiterated frenchs support for the security 
councils demand that iraq withdraw unilaterally and totally any 
partial withdrawal would not be sufficient he said 
time is passing he said the leaders of iraq and 
particularly the president must have a clear awareness of the 
risks they are running

former president daniel ortega said 
wednesday he helped persuade president saddam hussein of iraq to 
free remaining western hostages to reduce the likelihood of a 
usled attack 
ortega returned to nicaragua on dec 16 from a 34day tour of 
the mideast during his trip he traveled twice to baghdad the 
iraqi capital where he met with saddam 
before leaving ortega met with us ambassador harry shlaudeman 
and a veteran mideast official from the state department a 
toplevel source within ortegas leftist sandinista front told the 
associated press 
the source said the us officials did not send saddam any 
messages but simply explained washingtons position on the persian 
gulf crisis 
a longtime sandinista militant told the associated press that 
ortega who lost feb 25 elections to violeta chamorro is seeking 
to revive his image as a statesman the militant said it is likely 
ortega will run in nicaraguas 1996 elections 
in private conversations the militant also said ortega is 
trying to drum up financial support for the sandinistas from libyan 
leader col moammar gadhafi 
in an interview ortega said wednesday that although iraqi 
officials favor a peaceful solution in the gulf they have 
committed themselves so much in this situation with such polarized 
positions that it is hard for them to take the first step 
in that sense our actions are aimed so that they search 
for the solution within the framework of the security council 
resolution ortega said what were doing is facilitating that 
peaceful solution 
the un security council has authorized iraqs opponents to use 
force if iraq fails to leave kuwait by jan 15 
ortega said that when he met saddam and iraqi foreign minister 
tariq aziz he broached the subject of releasing the hostages 
before christmas 
we told him that it was a very sensitive theme a theme that 
was being exploited in favor of war in the zone and that the most 
convenient thing was to seek a way to exit totally that 
situation ortega said 
in other words we made the presentation and he said he would 
seek a way to act on that 
ortega said while he was in bonn germany on dec 5 iraqs 
ambassador to that country approached him with a message from 
hussein 
the message was that within the next few hours he would 
release all the foreigners ortega said 
the next day saddam announced his intention to free all 
remaining foreigners

turkey the only nato nation bordering 
iraq has asked the western alliance for air units to bolster its 
frontier before the jan 15 deadline for iraqi withdrawal from 
kuwait sources said wednesday 
the request for the units has to be approved by defense 
officials of the north atlantic treaty organization before they 
could be deployed 
but a nato official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
that so far there has been no opposition to the request so its 
not a big problem he said 
the requested units are from the allied command europe mobile 
force a mobile multinational force armed with conventional 
weapons said a senior nato source 
set up in 1960 it is designed to be sent at short notice to any 
threatened part of the european command and primarily to reduce the 
vulnerability of the alliances flank regions 
turkey has asked for a force comprising 5000 men to be in place 
on its southeastern border with iraq by jan 15 said the source 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
that is the deadline set by the un security council for iraq 
to unconditionally withdraw from kuwait or face military action 
the nato mobile force has both land and air forces and can be 
deployed within a week on direct orders of the defense ministers of 
the 16 alliance nations it can draw troops from a number of 
members including the united states britain the netherlands 
canada and germany 
turkeys armed forces of 800000 troops are the second largest 
in the nato alliance after the united states about 100000 troops 
are along its border with iraq 
turkish newspapers reported the government requested the nato 
units last week 
the reports said it was the first time turkey had asked nato for 
such a force to strengthen its own armies on the alliances 
southeastern flank 
turkish defense minister husnu dogan was quoted by the 
newspapers as saying the reports were baseless theres been no 
change in our policy in this regard we have made no such 
request he was quoted as saying 
foreign ministry spokesman murat sungar at a weekly briefing 
wednesday would neither confirm nor deny the accounts 
turkey was singled out for support during a meeting of nato 
foreign ministers on monday and tuesday at alliance headquarters in 
brussels 
in a statement the ministers noted that the persian gulf crisis 
poses a potential threat to turkey and reaffirmed their 
determination to go to its aid in case of attack 
we reiterate our firm commitment to the security of the entire 
southern region the strategic importance of which is highlighted 
by this crisis it said 
under natos 1949 treaty member nations agree to defend one 
another from armed attack

a japanese professor was named wednesday 
by the un secretarygeneral as his choice for high commissioner 
for refugees ending a 10month search that angered some of the 
agencys major donors 
sadako ogata a ustrained professor and specialist in human 
rights was nominated for the un post by javier perez de cuellar 
his office said the general assembly is expected to confirm the 
choice by acclamation friday un officials said 
mrs ogata 63 would be responsible for protecting 15 million 
refugees worldwide during a threeyear term she would be the first 
woman to hold the post that has traditionally gone to western men 
including many highprofile politicians and fundraisers 
the search for a new high commissioner has been clouded by 
allegations of favoritism and highhandedness by un officials 
some member states especially western nations that are major 
donors of refugee aid said they were not sufficiently consulted 
the secretarygeneral has denied the charges 
the controversy broke out in november when it appeared that the 
secretarygeneral was about to nominate virendra dayal an indian 
who is his closest aide after the complaints by western nations 
dayal withdrew his nomination but angrily denounced his opponents 
and suggested they are racist 
un officials said her nomination marks the beginning of a new 
era of sensitivity to naming women to high un posts and the end 
of domination of the refugee post by western european men 
her selection also recognizes japans formidable role in the 
world economy and its contribution to un peacekeeping and 
humanitarian efforts her husband shijuruo is deputy governor of 
japans development bank 
mrs ogata is dean of the faculty of foreign studies at sophia 
university in tokyo and professor at the institute of international 
relations for advanced studies on peace and development in asia at 
the university 
she became japans first woman minister to the united nations in 
1976 and she served as chairman of the executive board of the un 
childrens fund from 197879 in those years she was also japans 
special un envoy 
mrs ogata is the independent expert of the un commission on 
human rights for burma from 198285 she was japans expert on the 
un commission on human rights 
she received a doctoral degree in political science from the 
university of california at berkeley in 1963 
mrs ogata will replace thorvald stoltenberg who recently 
resigned to become deputy prime minister of norway 
when his withdrew his nomination in november dayal challenged 
the motives of the nations that opposed him 
its a feeling that you have to be a western european to do a 
job of integrity he told a news conference its a feeling 
that a western european has to carry the burden of the white man 
the last high commissioner stoltenberg replaced jeanpierre 
hocke who resigned in october 1989 hocke left under a cloud when 
it was disclosed that he had used a special education fund over a 
period of years to upgrade his airline travel to first class

prime minister salim hoss resigned on 
wednesday to make way for a broadbased government that will try to 
end 15 years of civil war 
but christian and moslem militia chieftains expressed 
reservations that could undermine peace efforts 
hoss a sunni moslem and veteran of lebanons turbulent 
politics formed his government on nov 25 1989 he presented the 
resignation of his 14member cabinet to president elias hrawi a 
maronite catholic hrawi asked hoss to stay on as caretaer prime 
minister 
the new cabinet will be charged with drafting a plan to disband 
the private armies that have fought each other since 1975 it is 
expected to include members from the main warring militias as well 
as political parties 
however the two strongest militias christian chieftain samir 
geageas lebanese forces and druse warlord walid jumblatts 
progressive socialist party expressed doubts about the plan 
the way the president is dealing with the question of a new 
government indicates he might bring in an untidy government that 
would stumble upon its first steps jumblatts party said this 
could create a dangerous power vacuum 
jumblatt a member of the outgoing cabinet has accused hrawi of 
corruption and favoritism hrawis aides accused jumblatt of 
corrupt deeds in his ministry of public works 
a lebanese forces statement said geagea will not take part in 
the new cabinet because it looks like it is going to be a tower 
of babel 
it said the new cabinet would require a statesman at the helm 
with the political experience and economic knowhow as well as 
the honesty of prime minister hoss 
hoss 61 a useducated banker turned politician said before 
resigning that he would not accept a new term he has headed four 
cabinets since 1976 
lebanons media predict outgoing education minister omar karami 
will become prime minister the 55yearold lawyer also a sunni 
inherited the leadership of lebanons secondlargest city tripoli 
from his elder brother the late prime minister rashid karami 
rashid karami the longestserving prime minister since lebanon 
gained independence from france in 1943 was assassinated by a bomb 
put aboard an army helicopter on june 1 1987 
hoss formed his cabinet hours after the election of 
syrianbacked hrawi to implement an arab leaguebrokered peace plan 
to end the civil war 
its main achievements were crushing an 11month mutiny by rebel 
gen michel aoun on oct 13 and unification of beiruts moslem and 
christian sectors on dec 3 
creating greater beirut was a key step in the peace accord 
hoss cabinet also enacted constitutional reforms to distribute 
power equally between moslems and christians 
hoss aides say privately he has been uneasy about hrawis 
insistence on making major decisions and handling state affairs 
exlusively 
the peace accord worked out by lebanese lawmakers in taif 
saudi arabia in october 1989 maintained the presidency for 
maronites the premiership for sunnis and the house speakership for 
shiite moslems 
it stripped the president of his traditional decisionmaking 
power stressing such powers required approval of both the 
president and the cabinet 
the new government must fill 31 vacancies in parliament by 
appointment and raise the number of seats from 99 to 108 to attain 
equality between christians and moslems christians have had a 
6to5 edge in parliament 
because of the civil war no parliamentary election has been 
held since 1972 the house repeatedly extended its fouryear terms 
plans to reconstruct beirut shore up the economy and reinstate 
government authority over the rest of lebanon must be considered by 
the new cabinet 
the civil war has claimed more than 150000 lives and caused up 
to 18 billion damage according to un estimates 
plans call for setting up an arab and international fund early 
next year with 2 billion earmarked for reconstruction

the un childrens fund on wednesday 
urged world leaders to make good on a recent pledge to help prevent 
millions of child deaths from hunger and disease this decade 
james p grant unicefs executive director who issued the 
report titled the state of the worlds children said the 
world has never before undertaken such a global commitment as it 
did for children in 1990 
seventyone presidents kings and prime ministers joined envoys 
of 88 other nations at the united nations on sept 19 the largest 
such gathering in history to pledge a redoubled effort to save 
children 
the summit set 20 goals for the year 2000 including a onethird 
reduction in child deaths a halving of child malnutrition and the 
introduction of basic schooling for at least 80 percent of the 
developing worlds children 
an estimated 40000 child die daily from sickness and 
malnutrition another estimated 150 million children worldwide lack 
proper health care and 100 million children aged 6 to 11 do not 
attend school the report said 
the declarations of political leaders are not enough the 
goals for the year 2000 must become the goals of society as a 
whole grant said 
the report urged nations to reexamine national spending 
priorities and public policies by no later than the end of 
1991 
while the cost of fulfilling the summit goals by 2000 will 
require roughly 20 billion a year much of that figure can be 
achieved by a reallocation of resources the report said 
it suggested a small reduction in military expenditures debt 
relief linked to investments in children and a reallocation of 
funds from highcost services to lowcost items such as vaccines 
with the ending of the cold war and the easing of regional 
tensions it cannot be too unrealistic to suggest a 5 percent cut 
in defense spending which would liberate half of the estimated 
20 billion a year needed to reach the year 2000 goals the 
report argued 
at present the report noted only about 3 percent of the 
industrialized worlds aid is devoted to such basics as primary 
education and primary health care 
but unicef said its goals are achievable one of its last 
10year goals the immunization of nearly 80 percent of the 
developing worlds children by 1990 has been virtually reached up 
from 15 percent immunization in 1980 
that extraordinary achievement unicef said has not only 
saved 12 million young lives it has also given the world new hope 
by showing what can be achieved when the international community 
commits itself to a great endeavor

the old farmers almanac the folksy 
oldfashioned american tradition has taken on new york magazine 
the trendy chronicle of life in the big city 
the 199yearold almanac filed a trademark infringement lawsuit 
wednesday accusing the magazine of imitating the almanacs 
distinctive cover design with the dec 3 issue 
the almanacs publisher yankee publishing inc of dublin nh 
said the covers were so similar that readers might be led to 
believe the almanac authorized or in some way sponsored its use by 
new york magazine 
the lawsuit said the magazine by imitating its trademarked 
cover had impaired the value of yankees cover design and the 
goodwill symbolized by it 
susan soriano a spokeswoman for the magazine said the magazine 
had not received the lawsuit and had no immediate comment 
the disputed cover titled the 1990 christmas gifts almanac 
promotes a story of gift suggestions for the holidays it is 
illustrated in a similar design as used by the almanac 
yankee accuses the magazine of copying among other things the 
overall distinctive yellow color the use of red and green 
highlights and a red and white border and a nearly identical style 
of typeface 
the lawsuit filed in us district court in manhattan seeks an 
order barring the magazine from using the design in the future it 
also seeks unspecified damages 
the almanac has been published annually since 1792

a south korean presidential envoy said 
wednesday his country remains committed to the liberalization of 
imports despite belttightening aimed at combatting social and 
economic deterioration 
for the first time since 1985 south korea will have a trade 
deficit this year now estimated at 2 billion former deputy prime 
minister soon cho told a national press club gathering 
the economic downturn does not appear to be just an economic 
matter and the whole social and political structure of korean 
society seem to be under strain he added 
cho said president roh taewoo dispatched him as a special envoy 
to assure us officials that import liberalization remains the 
mainspring of trade policy despite growing problems such as 
inflation and accelerating consumption 
he has talked with members of congress commerce secretary 
robert mosbacher trade representative carla hills and other 
economic officials of president george bushs administration 
many us officials believe south korea has used alleged 
overconsumption as an excuse to discriminate against imports 
cho said south korea has undertaken an austerity campaign with 
the innocuous motive to arrest the deteriorating socioeconomic 
conditions 
he said it was unfortunate that the campaign carried the smack 
of an antiimport effort 
cho called social and political conditions at home a state of 
turmoil 
wages have risen at least 20 percent annually for the past three 
years and workers attitudes have changed for the worse he 
said radical student groups have been trying to instigate 
workers and farmers who feel they do not get a fair deal out of the 
countrys rapid economic growth 
annual manufacturing growth has fallen from 17 to 7 percent and 
economic growth is now led by construction service and 
consumption he said 
farmers are poorer than urban people and feel 
industrialization has bypassed them but they enjoy widespread 
sympathy and political power to resist the opening of markets to 
imported farm products cho said

casual use of cocaine the most virulent drug 
of the 1980s has fallen 72 percent in the last five years the 
government said in a report issued wednesday 
the magnitude of the progress is impressive indeed 
president bush said at a news conference releasing the household 
survey on drug abuse the news we have today suggests that our 
hard work is paying off and our national strategy is having an 
effect 
but critics including sen joseph r biden jr took issue with 
the survey biden ddel said it misses more addicts than it 
counts 
not all the news was positive 
the survey reported a continuing of a trend found two years ago 
the number of people who used cocaine daily or almost daily rose by 
37 percent over five years from 246000 in 1985 to 336000 this 
year 
in addition the number of current crack cocaine users remained 
stable at about a halfmillion nida director charles r schuster 
said the survey undercounts such users 
bush said its too early to declare a victory despite the 
findings that drug use in general is down 
as long as there are hospital rooms filled with drugaffected 
babies neighborhoods ravaged by drug violence or children 
threatened by addiction a declaration of victory would be 
premature bush said 
about 129 million people 64 percent of the population age 12 
and older are current users also known as casual users 
meaning they use some kind of illicit drug at least once a month 
according to the survey sponsored by the national institute on drug 
abuse 
thats 44 percent fewer than the 23 million in 1985 an 11 
percent decline from the 145 million two years ago 
for current cocaine use the decline was even more dramatic 
down 72 percent from 58 million in 1985 to 16 million this year 
since 1988 the number dropped 45 percent from 29 million 
the survey did not specify how much of a drug was used only how 
frequently it was used 
on capitol hill biden said a study by his senate judiciary 
committee estimates about 24 million people use cocaine at least 
once a week not the 662000 cited in the household survey 
and the committee report says the number of such hardcore 
cocaine users has increased by 200000 rather than declining by 
that number as the nida survey indicated 
rep charles rangel dny chairman of house select committee 
on narcotics abuse and control said he believes drug use is 
dropping among those who are best equipped to avoid the lure of 
drugs 
however i do not think that drug use has decreased among 
those who are a part of the populations that are homeless in 
prison in hospitals receiving treatment for aids and other 
drugrelated illnesses or similar groups located in our inner 
cities rangel said 
administration officials acknowledged that the household survey 
misses homeless people as well as those in prison shelters 
drugtreatment centers and other institutions such as dormitories 
they also said 18 percent of the households contacted declined to 
participate 
schuster estimated that as many as 50 percent of the more than 1 
million people imprisoned nationwide are drug users 
but dr james o mason assistant secretary for health said the 
surveys tracking of trends if not the precise numbers of users 
is accurate because the survey has been administered the same way 
all 10 times since 1971 he also said the findings are similar to 
those of other studies 
its evident the survey misses many drug users 
for example it estimates thre are 48000 current users of 
heroin when nida has been saying for the past decade that there are 
about 500000 heroin addicts people who use the drug far more 
often than once a month 
among the surveys findings based on interviews this year with 
9259 people age 12 and over 
the number of adolescents using any illicit drugs dropped in 
the past two years by 13 percent from 19 million to 16 million 
for cocaine the number dropped 49 percent from 225000 to 
115000 
emergency rooms are seeing fewer cocainerelated cases the 
number decreased 95 percent from the first quarter to the second 
quarter of 1990 its down 33 percent from the highest levels 
recorded in the fourth quarter of 1988 and the second quarter of 
1989 
heroinrelated emergency room cases dropped 18 percent from the 
second quarter of 1988 to the second quarter of 1990 about the 
same decrease experienced for all drugrelated emergency room 
visits combined 
marijuana remains the most commonly used illicit drug even 
though the number of current users has declined 43 percent in the 
last five years from 18 million in 1985 to 102 million this year 
the number of people who drink alcoholic beverages weekly 
declined 24 percent over five years from 546 million in 1985 to 
417 million this year 
current cigarette users declined 111 percent from 603 
million in 1985 to 536 million this year 
louis w sullivan secretary of the department of health and 
human services said the survey results must be greeted with 
guarded optimism 
there are still millions of americans trapped in the web of 
addiction poor health violence crime and death he said 
despite this impressive good news about our progress many 
pockets of serious drug problems remain

portauprince haiti ap five years after the fall of the 
duvalier family dictatorship haitians have finally chosen a 
president in this impoverished caribbean nations first fully 
democratic election 
now the probable winner the rev jeanbertrand aristide faces 
the job of carrying out his pledge to wash away the duvalier legacy 
of repression corruption and government neglect 
that legacy includes an army notorious for its human rights 
abuses an ineffectual judicial system a population with a 65 
percent illiteracy rate and a per capita income of 360 a year 
the danger for aristide a charismatic priest with huge popular 
support but virtually no government experience is that he may be 
unable to satisfy the high expectations he has raised among the 
haitis poor 
they hope he will bring better living conditions and an end to 
totalitarian rule 
three days after sundays election only 153 percent of the 
official results had been announced but they gave aristide an 
overwhelming 65 percent of the vote in line with the outcome 
projected by international observers 
the priests nearest competitor among the 10 other candidates 
former world bank official marc bazin regarded as the bush 
administrations favorite was a distant second with 115 percent 
of the vote 
aristide will ask opposition parties to form an alliance with 
his new government his major adviser evans paul said wednesday 
paul coleader with aristide of the coalition national front for 
democracy and change said they would especially seek out the 
centerright national industrial and agricultural party led by 
louis dejoie jr who drew 27267 votes or 84 percent 
jeanclaude bajeaux a prominent human rights activist 
attributed aristides apparent landslide win to his fight against 
duvalierists who have gone unpunished for the atrocities of the 
29year dictatorship 
aristide is the medium through which the people have 
discovered the possibility of being protected by being together 
bajeaux said thats what the other haitian politicians didnt 
understand the people wanted justice 
aristide 37 has been the target of several assassination 
attempts including a 1988 attack at his former church in which at 
least 12 of his parishioners were murdered and 70 wounded 
in the only violence of the election campaign terrorists hurled 
a grenade and fired bullets into an aristide rally on dec 5 
killing seven and wounding more than 50 others 
with the victory of aristide the people have taken back feb 
7 1986 which the duvalierists stole said bus driver pierre 
merveille 44 
on that day jeanclaude baby doc duvalier fled to france 
after a popular uprising ending the dynasty found by his late 
father francois papa doc in 1957 haitians celebrated then 
expecting broad change instead they have seen five governments 
four controlled by the army 
because aristide is so closely identified with the struggle 
against tyranny haitians may be expecting more of him than they 
would from an establishment politician but his popularity with the 
impoverished masses ironically may be his achilles heel 
dr louis roy president of the interim goverments advisory 
council of state and principal author of the 1987 constitution 
said aristide must move swiftly to make changes 
within his oneyear grace period he must take the first 
spectacular steps to show he intends to strengthen public finances 
the judicial system and provide essential social services 
roy said 
but aristide risks a backlash from such traditional powers as 
the military and the wealthy elite if he clamps down too hard and 
too fast said anne fuller associate director of the new 
yorkbased national coalition for haitian refugees who was in 
haiti to observe the election 
my feeling is that hes not going to act very quickly on these 
things she said 
aristide adheres to liberation theology which encourages the 
poor to demand their rights he was expelled from his conservative 
salesian order in 1988 for allegedly fomenting revolution 
he remains a roman catholic priest but has said he will renounce 
his calling if the vatican imposes its policy against holding 
political office 
his leftist philosophy has raised concern among the business 
establishment and the bush administration but the us government 
has pledged support for the democratic transition which is 
expected to result in a resumption of largescale foreign aid 
robert pastor latin america specialist at the carter center in 
atlanta who also observed the election said he thought a critical 
decision for aristide will be the appointment of a prime minister 
with sound administrative experience 
bazin has been mentioned but the onetime finance minister and 
aristide are at opposite political poles and paul said on wednesday 
there is no possibility aristide would ask bazin to be prime 
minister 
the army has pledged support for the transition to democracy 
but the intentions of duvalier sympathizers within remain unclear 
about 800 international observers including former president 
jimmy carter were on hand for the election millions of dollars in 
foreign aid poured in for voting materials and equipment 
despite serious delays at some polling stations due to 
logistical problems the observers unanimously declared the 
election open fair and peaceful

corruption 
longtime alderman fred roti and chicago businessman pasquale 
marcy were charged with racketeering racketeering conspiracy 
bribery extortion and interstate travel in aid of racketeering 
roti 70 has proclaimed his innocence since reports surfaced 
months ago that he was a target of a federal investigation he 
appeared untroubled after a 14count indictment was issued against 
him 
you might say im concerned but i guess you have to learn to 
live with it and be strong he said 
marcys attorney said the charges are unsubstantiated 
marcy and roti were charged with six different instances of 
paying officials to influence decisions 
the indictment detailed tampering in criminal nonjury trials 
and civil cases in state court fixing zoning applications in the 
city and bribing officials in the appointment of an associate judge 
in cook county circuit court 
marcy and roti also were accused of fixing murder trials in 
1977 1981 and 1986 in those cases the defendants were acquitted

investigation saying the probe dubbed operation gambat is 
continuing and more indictments are expected 
david j shields a former presiding judge in the chancery 
division of cook county circuit court and chicago attorney 
pasquale de leo were charged with extortion false statements and 
interstate travel in aid of racketeering 
their sevencount indictment charges that de leo 45 accepted 
11000 from an attorney working undercover for the fbi 
investigators said de leo delivered some of that money to shields 
58 to influence the judges decisions on motions filed during an 
undercover case set up by the fbi in 1988 
de leos lawyer samuel banks said my client will persist in 
the plea of not guilty 
dan webb an attorney representing shields and roti said his 
clients will be vindicated in court 
im confident well be able to establish their innocence 
webb said

with two counts of extortion and one count of tax fraud darco 
46 has been a member of the legislature for 13 years and is a 
member of the senates insurance committee

fbi agent after agreeing to support insurance legislation darco 
also is charged with failing to report 5000 of that money on his 
1988 tax return 
his attorney jeffrey steinback said he will plead innocent 
thornburgh said he was shocked at the corruption uncovered in 
the investigation 
i think the individual acts of corruption are appalling he 
said were going to be relentless trying to get this type of 
corruption exposed through effective prosecution 
the public officials face substantial prison terms if 
convicted 
the extortion racketeering and racketeering conspiracy charges 
bring maximum penalties of 20 years in prison and a 250000 fine 
the maximum penalty for bribery is 10 years imprisonment and a 
fine of 250000

and giving false statements is five years in prison and a 250000 
fine 
a conviction for tax fraud could bring three years imprisonment

another wideranging undercover probe centered in chicago was 
dubbed operation greylord in which fbi agents posed as corrupt 
attorneys to gather evidence on lawyers and cook county judges

stuart lockwood a 5yearold shown on television 
with saddam hussein when the british boy and other hostages met the 
iraqi leader in august was awarded a child of courage medal 
wednesday 
the medal was presented by the duchess of york prince andrews 
wife the former sarah ferguson at a ceremony at westminster 
abbey during the ceremony 11 youngsters received medals for 
courage and bravery 
stuart who took the duchess hand and walked her to her car 
after the presentations seemed especially interested in her auto 
she let me look inside it had big seats and a telephone he 
said

on aug 23 they showed stuart standing next to the seated saddam 
during a meeting between the iraqi leader and a group of western 
hostages in baghdad iraqs capital 
in the footage broadcast worldwide a smiling saddam was seen 
putting his arm around stuarts shoulders as the boy tried to 
shrink from the embrace saddam also patted the boys head in the 
staged show of affection while an iraqi military officer ruffled 
the boys hair 
the tv pictures shown repeatedly came to symbolize the 
vulnerability of the foreign hostages following iraqs aug 2 
invasion of kuwait 
iraq said it staged the meeting between saddam and the group to 
show that the foreign guests as it called them were well but 
critics said the televised meeting was a cynical propaganda ploy by 
saddam to use the hostages to try to weaken the coalition of 
foreign powers opposing him 
stuart and his mother 39yearold teacher glenda lockwood 
arrived back in london on sept 2 among the first foreign women and 
children to be released from iraq they returned on a plane with 
the rev jesse jackson who had gone to baghdad to ask for the 
release of foreigners 
stuarts father derek lockwood a 43yearold engineer arrived 
in britain to rejoin his family on dec 10 after iraqs decision to 
free all foreign hostages 
mrs lockwood said wednesday that stuart had been emotionally 
clingy after his return to britain but she said the boy had 
reverted to his normal outgoing self following the return of his 
father

a federal judge approved a settlement 
wednesday with the government that stalls deportation of thousands 
of salvadoran and guatemalan refugees denied political asylum 
settlement of a 1985 civil lawsuit on behalf of about 80 
sanctuary assistance organizations was signed by us district 
judge robert peckham 
the agreement was supported by the justice department but is 
subject to a final approval hearing jan 31 in san francisco 
the settlement applies to every salvadoran and guatemalan in 
the united states who has been denied asylum since 1980 frand 
deale legal director of the center for constitutional rights said 
in a statement from new york 
the settlement calls for new deportation hearings for thousands 
of refugees 
as many as 150000 denials will have to be readjudicated and 
up to 500000 salvadoran and guatemalans will be affected by the 
settlement deale said 
we think it is a fair agreement but well make no further 
statement justice department spokesman joe krovisky said 
years of legal wrangling included peckhams rebuff of government 
attempts to dismiss the lawsuit peckham rejected government 
arguments that the lawsuit depended on foreign policy questions 
outside the courts authority 
the case was handled by deales center the national lawyers 
guild the americal civil liberties union and the san francisco law 
firm morrison and forrester 
the lawsuit claiming discrimination contended the government 
was violating its own immigration laws by rejecting nearly all 
requests for political asylum from natives of the two central 
american countries 
it said despite civil strife in those countries only 3 percent 
of salvadorans and less than 1 percent of guatemalans were granted 
asylum on the grounds that they feared political persecution 
by contrast the lawsuit said half or more of the applicants 
from such countries as afghanistan poland and nicaragua were 
granted asylum 
the lawsuit said the disproportional percentages plainly favored 
refugees fleeing countries deemed to be communist 
the plaintiffs said the settlement modified the role of the 
state department by allowing input from other agencies in each 
case 
the state department will now declare that its recommendation 
will be only one of several factors to be considered by asylum 
officers the plaintiffs said 
in tucson ariz the rev john fife one of eight defendants 
convicted on conspiracy and aliensmuggling charges in may 1986 
said this is a great christmas present for refugees the best 
one that i could imagine 
our basic legal position has now been vindicated which was 
that it was the immigration and naturalization service in violation 
of the 1980 law not the sanctuary movement he said 
the lawsuit was filed against the ins and the us attorney 
general after sanctuary movement activists were indicted in 1985 
stemming from the governments undercover infiltration and secret 
taperecording of church services and meetings

the handwriting is on the wall for 
california graffiti artists a scribble could leave them walking 
for a year 
beginning jan 1 a new law will allow courts to suspend the 
driving privileges for a year for anyone over the age of 13 
convicted of graffititype vandalism 
another new law that takes effect with the new year will permit 
cities and counties to tax aerosol spray cans 10 cents each and 
indelible felttip markers five cents each to pay for graffiti 
cleanups 
the laws are aimed at curbing the gangrelated scribbling and 
unsightly markups that deface the environment such as a recent 
case in los angeles in which one youngster caused 500000 in 
damages 
the economic consequences of graffiti vandalism are 
enormous said state sen quentin kopp author of the license 
bill 
san francisco spent over 2 million last year cleaning up 
graffiti the city of los angeles spent 9 million graffiti also 
debilitates urban dwellers because it bolsters the impression that 
our cities are crimeridden and unsafe said kopp an independent 
from san francisco 
other new graffitirelated laws will make it an infraction to 
write graffiti on public transit buses or trains and will require 
convicted litterers to be sentenced to picking up litter or 
cleaning up graffiti 
kopp said the california legislature is getting tough on 
graffiti because of the proliferation of scrawls and scribbles in 
public places in urban areas 
last week an 18yearold los angeles man was accused of 
painting the word chaka on 10000 traffic signs utility poles 
buildings and walls in southern california causing about 500000 
in damage 
the new law will allow a judge to suspend for one year the 
drivers license of a person 13 years or older convicted of 
graffitirelated vandalism if a 13 or 14 year old doesnt yet have 
a license the court can delay issuance of the license for a year 
after the teen would otherwise be able to get it 
california allows drivers licenses at age 16 with a parents 
signature 
if the 13 or 14yearold doesnt have another conviction for 
graffiti in a year he or she can ask the court to modify the 
suspension the suspension period can also be cut by one day for 
each hour the convicted person spend cleaning up graffiti from 
public property 
kopp notes that current law allows courts to suspend or delay 
drivers licenses for minors convicted of drug and alcohol crimes 
even if the offenses are not drivingrelated 
the punishment fits the crime and the criminal because 
teenagers prize a drivers license above all else kopp said 
the american civil liberties union and california attorneys for 
criminal justice opposed the bill when it moved through the 
legislature saying it was inappropriate to deny a license for 
conduct unrelated to driving 
more appropriate penalties for these type of minor offenses 
would include cleaning up the graffiti cleaning other public areas 
or working with others in painting murals in public places the 
aclu said in a statement opposing the bill 
thats a lame argument kopp said we do not literally 
tailor the punishment to every crime that is committed we do not 
amputate the pickpockets hand

mbongeni ngemas sarafina celebrated the 
courageous schoolchildren of soweto the black south african 
enclave that exploded in rebellion against an oppressive white 
government in 1976 
the unusual and often exuberant musical was a surprise success 
at lincoln center three years ago it later moved to broadway for a 
long run and is still touring 
now ngema is back in new york with another musical for lincoln 
center theater but this time the company has found its way to the 
majestic an old movie house off flatbush avenue in brooklyn where 
director peter brook presented his mahabharata and the cherry 
orchard 
the crumbling film palace deliberately left in a state of 
semidecay is an evocative home for township fever ngemas 
latest effort which is done in conjunction with the brooklyn 
academy of music the shabby surroundings complement a shantytown 
of corrugated iron huts strung across the wide stage 
but the show which runs about half an hour too long is not as 
consistently stirring as sarafina thats because its more 
polemical moments are stridently or broadly dramatized and might 
have been more effective if sung or danced 
but when the music takes over township fever manages to be 
as heartfelt as its precedessor exuding a theatricality that 
reinforces the shows antiapartheid message 
in township fever rebellion is again in the air yet the 
musical which opened wednesday takes a more ambiguous approach 
than sarafina to another turbulent episode in the history of 
modernday south africa ngemas new work looks at black vs black 
in a world where the rules are set by the white minority heroes 
and villains are not so easily defined 
the musical puts on stage the 1987 strike by black railway 
workers of the south african transport services ngema personalizes 
the events telling them through a young man named jazz his 
girlfriend tonko and best friend and eventual betrayer 
philadelphia 
during the walkout several scabs who go to work for the 
railroad are murdered by strikers it is the leading characters 
friend who fingers the killers today facing death sentences they 
are still in jail 
ngema not only wrote the book music and lyrics for township 
fever but he directed and choreographed the show as well hes 
the one who must take responsibility for lag in interest between 
the song and dance 
still township fever soars during those musical moments 
most of them done in mbaqanga a type of rock music infused with 
jazz and found in south african townships the score is infectious 
and rousingly sung by a large cast particularly brian mazibuko as 
the doomed hero and sindiswa dlathu as his true love they get 
strong help from a distinctive supporting cast as well as from a 
large onstage orchestra that peers out from behind those township 
hovels 
the dancing has the same vitality found in sarafina one 
wishes there were more of it particularly because the choreography 
allows designer sarah roberts to show off a colorful array of 
exotic costumes 
but for the most part in township fever the message is in 
the music and when they come together it makes for a stirring 
evening of theater

a man who successfully appealed his conviction in 
the 1976 carbomb slaying of a newspaper reporter will be tried 
again on a murder charge the arizona attorney general said 
wednesday 
contractor and speculator max dunlap was charged a second time 
in the slaying of don bolles a reporter for the arizona republic 
said the state official bob corbin 
another man plumber james robison who also won an appeal of 
his murder conviction in the case was charged anew in november 
1989 both men had been sentenced to death 
bolles died june 13 1976 11 days after a remotecontrolled 
bomb ripped through his car as he backed out of a hotel parking 
lot authorities never established a firm motive in the killing and 
theories still abound 
a greyhound breeder john harvey adamson testified as part of a 
plea bargain he planted the bomb that killed bolles 
adamson said dunlap ordered the bombing to ingratiate himself 
with a friend land and liquor magnate kemper marley who died 
earlier this year 
bolles wrote extensively about marley for his newspaper 
adamson testified that robison built the bomb and detonated it 
the convictions against dunlap and robison were overturned on 
appeal in 1980 and adamson refused to testify again unless 
prosecutors met certain demands including an education fund for 
his children 
prosecutors refused and adamson eventually was convicted of 
firstdegree murder in the killing but an appeals court reduced 
his sentence from death to life in prison and the us supreme 
court let that decision stand 
adamsons conviction was upheld however 
corbin said adamson has agreed to testify in the new cases 
against dunlap and robison in exchange for immunity from 
prosecution on a number of related charges and a maximum prison 
sentence of about 20 years on a charge of seconddegree murder in 
bolles slaying 
prosecutors agreed to give adamson credit for about 13 years he 
has already served and agreed to parole after he hits the 20year 
mark 
corbin who leaves office in january has repeatedly derided 
adamsons credibility since the quarrel with prosecutors over his

a year ago thursday us troops 
invaded panama to oust gen manuel antonio noriega and install 
guillermo endara as president officially the anniversary is 
called a day of national reflection 
noriegas opponents and the families of those who died in the 
fighting had sought a day of national mourning but didnt get 
it 
gone is the euphoria that welcomed the americans and the removal 
of noriega now in miami awaiting trial on drug trafficking 
charges 
us military presence on the streets today however diminished 
is seen as an irritant by nationalists one small sign of the 
problems endara faces in his efforts to keep his government alive 
and democracy intact in panama after a troubled year 
his supporters are turning against him labor unrest is on the 
rise and a feeling exists that the us military is replacing 
noriega as the real power here 
the united states interference through its forces and its 
ambassador is pretty open said marco gandazegui director of the 
private center for latin american studies in panama 
on dec 5 us soldiers were used at endaras request to quell 
a relatively minor revolt of disgruntled police 
when riots broke out over a law authorizing firing of about 500 
public employees who backed a strike call one of the first people 
to meet with legislative leaders was col james steele head of the 
us army support group working with the panamanian government 
interior minister ricardo arias calderon heads the newly 
structured civilian police force that replaced noriegas military 
government sources said the americans told arias calderon to let 
the police take care of its own and organize the special military 
units the united states wants for canal security 
the sources spoke on condition of anonymity 
the united states turns the panama canal over to panama at the 
end of the century and wants to see the waterway in the hands of a 
stable democracy 
the roman catholic church a noriega foe and formerly a solid 
backer of endara now calls his government inflexible 
even the united states says panama could be vulnerable to 
remilitarization 
the specter of militarism reappeared in panama and it 
represented a clear and real danger to constitutional democracy 
us ambassador deane hinton said of the police uprising which 
endara called a coup attempt 
hinton told businessmen that democracy does not come easily 
but added the government of panama has come a long way in a 
year 
endara conceded we have many problems and few resources he 
said much has been accomplished but democracy in panama 
remains in danger 
his nationally televised speech wednesday night focused on the 
last years of noriega rule 
a night like tonight a year ago was the last night of 
tyranny in panama the detonator was a military action of force 
but behind it was a long calvary of suffering of rebelliousness 
and protests he said 
he urged panamanians not to let this happen again on our soil 
the calvary is over 
losses from looting and other causes not stemming from the 
fighting a year ago have been estimated at up to 15 billion 
endara has suggested the united states owes reparations for 
invasion damage but no amount has been mentioned 
the high expectations of many following noriegas overthrow 
which according to the us southern command left up to 345 
soldiers and civilians dead have now turned to frustration the 
government is accused of inactivity and worse 
only about 84 million has been used of 461 million in us aid 
allotted for panama much has been held up pending reforms 
washington asks in banking secrecy laws and the like most aimed at 
drug trafficking an money laundering 
leaders here find it hard politically to support the demands 
the military has ruled panama often behind a civilian facade 
since 1968 the militarys loss of stature apparently was behind 
the uprising of retired col eduardo hererra and about 35 followers 
this month they said they acted to get more respect from a 
civilian government that had humiliated them 
noriegas defense forces had 16000 members the civilian police 
force that replaced them has 13000 with drastically reduced 
duties and about half the budget formerly allotted about 40 
percent of the officer corps has been ousted 
endara defended his asking for us troops to put down the 
uprising saying it avoided the return of a dictatorship and a 
bloodbath of panamanians 
the president inherited a wrecked government and ruined economy 
despite withering problems progress has been made 
unemployment is at about 25 percent but substantially better 
than a year ago 
the economy is growing again after years of shrinkage 
it is not true that we havent done anything arias calderon 
protests we have done a lot with human rights democratization 
and returning confidence economic activation international 
recognition 
panama is moving to reduce its 38 billion foreign debt after 
noriega suspended payment on it for two years

the walt disney co has decided to stop 
selling a doll that depicts a street tramp after pressure from 
homeless activists 
the rev christopher rose who inspired the protest early this 
month called the action a hollow victory because there isnt 
enough time to recall the dolls before christmas 
steve the tramp a 5inch plastic figure and one of a series 
of 14 coppers and gangsters based on the story of dick 
tracy sparked protests from advocates for the homeless who said 
the description on its package degraded those living on the 
streets 
the tramp is described as hardened and bitter after a life on 
the mean streets a lout who would just as soon take your life 
as your wallet 
rose rector of grace episcopal church in hartford cited steve 
the tramp as one of the most offensive toys of the 1990 christmas 
season rose has an annual display he calls warped toys for 
christmas 
im glad somebody there got a conscience rose said tuesday 
when he learned of disneys action 
in recalling the doll the walt disney co in burbank calif 
said in a statement monday it felt the doll was misunderstood 
when viewed outside the fantasy world of dick tracy 
joining in the statement was playmates toys inc of la mirada 
calif which is licensed by disney to manufacture and market the 
toy 
playmates has decided to discontinue production and 
distribution of the doll disney has removed the figure from 
shelves at its chain of retail stores and theme parks the 
statement said 
because we are concerned that this product may be conveying a 
negative image of our nations homeless we feel it is appropriate 
to stop selling the toy 
chuck champlin a disney spokesman acknowledged that it was too 
late to get the toys off the shelves of all retailers before 
christmas 
some retailers discontinued sale of the doll after advocates for 
the homeless protested and picketed stores

burmese dissidents have declared a 
rival government and denounced military rulers for failing to hand 
over power to the opposition which won free elections seven months 
ago 
burma has become a country shrouded by darkness because of all 
the unlawful arrests tortures and persecutions and human rights 
violations the dissidents said in a declaration issued tuesday 
and seen in bangkok on wednesday 
diplomats in rangoon said they feared the move could prompt a 
new clampdown by the government 
the dissidents calling themselves the national coalition 
government of the union of burma said they had picked sein win as 
prime minister 
he is a cousin of aung san suu kyi the opposition leader whose 
national league for democracy won 80 percent of the parliamentary 
seats contested in mays national election 
the opposition leader has been under house arrest since july 
1989 and her party has not been allowed to govern on tuesday 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar urged the burmese 
government to release her 
the military government said wednesday night it would free ms 
suu kyi only if she left burma to join her family in britain its 
reply to perez de cuellar came in a foreign ministry statement 
carried by state radio 
most of the partys leaders have been detained since the army 
took power by crushing a nationwide movement for democracy in 1988 
sein win said forming the new body was the only option for us 
to choose because this military junta has no will and no way to 
transfer power to the people 
the announcement of the formation of a new government was made 
at the headquarters of the karen national union in manerplaw about 
120 miles northeast of rangoon on the frontier with thailand the 
karen are an ethnic rebel group that has fought successive 
governments in rangoon since the 1940s 
the dissidents named an eightmember cabinet all of whom had 
won parliamentary seats in the election six are league members and 
one is an independent sein win is a member of the closely allied 
national democracy party 
all had fled under threat of arrest when their plan to form a 
parallel government became known to the rangoon government the 
military government said earlier this month it had arrested 48 
members of the national league for democracy for involvement in the 
plan 
diplomats from rangoon have said the figure could be higher 
the dissidents called for the immediate elimination of the 
military administration a national convention including members of 
parliament and insurgent groups and the establishment of a 
democratic government 
their goal they said was to create an independent 
prosperous and modernized federal union of burma 
troops killed thousands of people crushing the prodemocracy 
movement in 1988 amnesty international and other human rights 
groups say hundreds and perhaps thousands of dissidents have since 
been detained without charge or trial or sentenced to prison terms 
after unfair military trials 
amnesty has cited numerous reports of routine torture of 
dissidents particularly of members of insurgent groups 
a rangoonbased diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity 
said tuesday the declaration of a rival government could give the 
military an excuse to intensify its crackdown on the opposition he 
said it might even provide a pretext for it to declare the national 
league for democracy illegal 
a powerful member of the rangoon government warned in newspaper 
interview published tuesday that the declaration would be a great 
mistake 
maj gen khin nyunt burmas head of military intelligence 
told the bangkok post the existing government was recognized by the 
united nations and he did not believe that any country would 
recognize a governmentinexile 
western diplomats expressed doubt that the breakaway group would 
garner much popular support inside burma the democratic alliance 
of burma an umbrella organization of 21 ethnic and other rebel 
groups fighting the central government backed the declaration the 
karen are members of the dab

the cabinet approved thursday a new fiveyear 
defense plan that will slow the growth of military spending but 
increase japans share of the cost of keeping us soldiers on its 
soil 
the average annual increase in military spending will be 3 
percent during the new 171 billion plan that begins next spring 
down from more than 5 percent annual growth the past five years 
the soviet union was a potential threat for japan in the past 
but we now believe that our potential threat has disappeared 
chief cabinet secretary misoji sakamoto said at a news conference 
tokyo will shoulder more of the costs of basing 50000 us 
soldiers in japan increasing its share from about 40 percent to 50 
percent within five years according to the government 
the japanus security treaty is the core of japans defense 
policy and therefore we will continue to increase our support for 
us troops in japan sakamoto said 
japan now pays about 3 billion annually toward stationing us 
troops here including many of the expenses for the 22000 japanese 
base workers 
under american pressure to pay more japan is now offering to 
cover the basic salaries of japanese base workers and utilities by 
the end of the new 5year plan sakamoto said he said the 
additional cost to japan would be 165 billion over five years 
the us embassy had no immediate comment on the proposal 
the united states which has provided a defensive umbrella for 
japan since world war ii has in the past pressed this nation for 
bigger military buildups 
but prime minister toshiki kaifu has argued that japans defense 
spending should reflect the easing of the cold war in europe 
sakamoto said there would be no increase in the number of 
japanese army soldiers who now number 153000 he said the 
government would consider troop cuts after three years 
defense agency officials and senior lawmakers of kaifus 
governing liberal democratic party have opposed a sharp defense 
budget cut saying the reduction in tensions has not yet extended 
to the far east 
even with slower growth the new program will include purchase 
of such advanced items as airborne warning and control systems 
which are flying command posts according to a military official 
who spoke on condition of anonymity

ten people protesting the removal of a 
feeding tube from nancy cruzan were forcibly removed from a 
hospital wednesday and outside doors to the building were locked as 
demonstrations continued outside 
ms cruzans condition deteriorated in the fifth day since a 
feeding tube was removed friday said barbara shoun a spokeswoman 
for the missouri rehabilitation center 
her parents fought lengthy legal battles before winning the 
right to remove the feeding tube in the first righttodie case 
decided by the us supreme court they contend their daughter 
would not want to live in her present state 
ms cruzan 33 has been in a persistent vegetative state since 
a 1983 car accident 
a leader in the antiabortion movement was on his way to this 
southwest missouri town in an attempt to meet with the parents to 
try to persuade them not to kill their daughter 
randall terry founder of operation rescue was expected to 
arrive in mount vernon by thursday said bob jewitt an operation 
rescue spokesman in atlanta 
this may be the most important story in the prolife 
history jewitt said this woman is not in a persistent 
vegetative state she is not a carrot shes a human being with 
blood in her veins and she must be saved 
joe and joyce cruzan will not meet with terry said their 
attorney william colby 
they had an auto accident that took their daughter and they 
were faced with two horrible decisions and now somebody they love 
very much is dying colby said 
there is enough pain from the auto accident that to compound 
that by having a group of strangers who never knew nancy 
interfering with the medical decisions is inappropriate he said 
about 20 demonstrators gathered at the hospital wednesday and 
some were allowed into the hospital chapel some then demanded to 
meet with the centers director and went to his office and began 
kneeling and praying and refusing to leave mrs shoun said 
about eight or 10 of the demonstrators were put in wheelchairs 
and pushed out of the building others were told to leave and did 
so mrs shoun said 
weve told groups that want to protest that theyre welcome to 
come as long as they stay outside mrs shoun said 
about a halfdozen protesters camped on the front steps 
wednesday afternoon kneeling and praying one held a sign that 
said please feed nancy 
authorities arrested 19 people tuesday who were held in the 
lawrence county jail on 500 bond all identified themselves as 
nancy cruzan and the sheriffs department said they could not be 
bonded out until they gave their real names 
all but one was fasting 
the us supreme court ruled in june that missouri could require 
clear and convincing evidence that ms cruzan would want to 
die 
the cruzans went back to local court where three friends and 
coworkers of ms cruzan testified they had talked about such a 
situation and ms cruzan had indicated she would want to die 
probate judge charles peel ruled friday there was sufficient 
evidence to allow the tube to be removed

the rich patrimony of artworks and archaeological 
relics in italys churches ruins and museums is slipping away 
through a sieve of inadequate security and border controls 
many italians feel the virtual elimination of border 
restrictions between european community nations in 1993 will amount 
to holding the door open for art smugglers and saying have a 
nice trip 
they also worry that objects legitimately purchased from 
collectors or dealers will cross borders without records making 
research more difficult for art historians and archaeologists 
italy has led efforts to preserve some controls on cultural 
treasures 
holding the european communitys rotating presidency this fall 
gave it the perfect opportunity to press the issue the italians 
soon found the lines firmly drawn in what has been called the 
battle of the haves and have nots 
on italys side are other mediterranean haves like spain and 
greece france which always has tried to keep its art at home 
also has pressed for controls 
britain is the leading advocate of a liberalized art market it 
has less to protect and is a center of the international art 
market 
when talks began in may the two camps were farther apart than 
on monetary unity said an official of the italian foreign 
ministry 
in late november with italys term as president running out 
culture ministers asked the ec executive branch to consult experts 
on devising a system for returning illegally exported treasures 
they also agreed to consider certifying artworks and artifacts 
and tightening controls on art leaving the community 
spain proposed that each item be issued a kind of visa britain 
has said it might consider certification for pieces beyond a 
certain worth but the ministry official said that would not work 
for italy 
a small etruscan vase can be worth only 5 million lire 
4300 but for us the value is much more he said because it 
helps complete the story of a collection found in a particular 
tomb 
robert spengler of the french culture ministry said a small 
government ministry might be required to handle certification 
another suggestion is restricting the scope of what constitutes 
a nations heritage 
on dec 13 the european parliament urged ec nations to use 
bettertrained custom officials and adopt tougher laws on sales of 
art and artifacts it also said member nations shouild respect each 
others laws on the subject 
those laws vary widely 
in italy anything unearthed of archaeological interest becomes 
state property 
if a stone lid of an etruscan sarcophagus turns up in holland 
can the owner be forced to give it back especially if he can prove 
he brought it in good faith from a reputable dealer would it all 
end up at the world court 
alessandra melucco of the central institute of restoration in 
rome said other countries had little sympathy for italy given its 
failure to protect excavations and museums adequately 
a superintendent of art in naples in desperation ordered a 
sculptured 15thcentury church entrance walled up this fall soon 
after it was restored he said that was the only way to keep 
vandals and thieves from striking again 
romes archaeology superintendent adriano la regina thinks 
1993 might not be so bad 
its better that objects are displayed in a museum wherever 
it is in the world than to stay in our storerooms on the 
theoretical pretext that they must be studied while nobody studies 
them he said at a forum sponsored by archeo an italian 
archaeology magazine 
after years of talk parliament approved funds this year for an 
ambitious inventory of italys cultural riches police recall 
countless thefts in which the museum or church did not have a photo 
that might aid in recovery 
baldassare conticello superintendent at pompeii said at the 
forum 
if an object is stolen and you can prove it in the end it 
will return since theft is covered by legislation of all nations 
but only a few producer states such as us greece turkey and 
cyprus have laws covering wealth thats underground

buras vertimor was 6 years old in 1975 
when indonesian invaders dropped from the sky above his home in 
east timor 
now he is 21 part of a new generation of east timorese who 
continue resisting indonesias annexation of their half of the 
island west timor is part of indonesia but east timor formerly 
belonged to portugal 
vertimor who fled timor in september belongs to an underground 
youth movement linked to timorese guerrillas who are trying to 
focus international attention on the largely forgotten conflict 
guerrilla leader xanana gusmao has described the youth movement 
as indonesias fundamental problem in east timor 
robert domm an australian trade unionist who met with gusmao in 
september says young people have been radicalized by the struggle 
a whole new generation of timorese are in some ways even more 
militant than the older generations he said during a visit to 
lisbon 
the resistance campaign which young timorese liken to the 
palestinian uprising in israelioccupied territories has taken 
advantage of indonesias cautious efforts to open the impoverished 
territory to outside scrutiny east timor was closed to outsiders 
after the invasion and annexation 
reports after the invasion told of massacres famine and 
epidemics 
diplomats in jakarta capital of indonesia say 60000 people 
died and roman catholic church officials say up to 100000 timorese 
were killed human rights groups estimate nearly onethird of the 
population put at 650000 by a portuguese census of 197475 died 
in the years following the takeover 
indonesia has not provided casualty figures it says east timor 
is peaceful now and indonesia is introducing economic and social 
improvements 
vertimor helped organize a student demonstration during the 
visit of pope john paul ii to dili capital of east timor in 
october 1989 
security forces arrested him shortly afterward he said he was 
beaten and tortured before his release and flight to portugal 
indonesia accuses portugal of running a propaganda campaign 
against it the united nations still considers portugal the 
colonial ruler of east timor for nearly 500 years the legal 
authority in the territory 
the indonesians say they invaded after portugals withdrawal in 
1975 left east timor in chaos the revolutionary front for an 
independent east timor known by the acronym fretilin won a brief 
civil war with conservative and proindonesian forces and declared 
independence 10 days before the invasion 
fretilin is the main political force behind the guerrillas who 
indonesia says have been reduced to about 200 poorly armed men who

beneficiaries are thousands of indonesian immigrants sent to east

peter sellars tends to do things a little 
differently even mozart for starters he set the marriage of 
figaro in manhattans glittering haven for all that glitters 
trump tower 
that was last week when pbs aired the first of three mozart 
operas that the innovative american directed for the longrunning 
great performances series 
on jan 4 viewers will be offered the sellars edition of don 
giovanni filmed in vienna and set in spanish harlem it features 
a cocainesnorting don who likes to consume big macs and stage 
orgies 
on feb 15 his cosi fan tutte will arrive its set in a 
westchester county diner 
sellars whose shows all have english subtitles says hes done 
all this so americans who have not taken a course in baroque 
costume design can understand the characters and the social 
structure 
during last weeks figaro overture footage of posh 
manhattan stores shoppers and limousines was shown the don 
giovanni overture plays over street scenes in the south bronx 
ruined buildings graffiti and dead rats 
the 33yearold director says that he used new york locales 
because theyre recognized worldwide mozart put figaro and 
don giovanni in seville which sellars says was similarly 
known 200 years ago 
we did these operas to please two sets of people people who 
know nothing about opera and connoisseurs who can tell the 
sophisticated choices were making musically he says 
sellars whose productions often cause outrage and uproar among 
traditionalists sees mozart as a man of the moment 
mozart wrote the most topical operas in the history of 
opera says the director he introduced figaro by saying 
stay tuned for an evening of outofcontrol sexual exploitation 
and aggression political theory and big entertainment 
much as young americans leave for saudi arabia in 1990 cosi 
offers two men who are leaving for war sellars says 
in 1791 active duty was the french revolution which was under 
way down the street when they sing people say the army is fun 
the irony was not lost on mozarts audience 
cosi sellars says is also about suburban wife swapping 
and is incorrectly called a comedy of manners it burrows to the 
root of deceptions that people live with and the quality that these 
deceptions have of eroding every piece of happiness youve ever 
known 
he believes the three operas are about how your heart and 
everything you believe are always shifting 
people of different classes and opposite sexes trade clothes and 
identities he says mozart says ok now be in somebody elses 
shoes and see what life is like see that everything you believed 
before is open to question 
the operas were performed before a live audience on a stage 
built in a tv studio in vienna 
you get live performances for live people not lip synching or 
the weird pall that comes over singers when theyre singing in a 
studio to nobody in particular its acrobatic staging theyre 
doing the wildest motions while staying correct musically 
five american singers sanford sylvan james maddalena susan 
larson frank kelley and sue ellen kuzma are in both figaro 
and cosi eugene perry sang don giovanni with his twin 
herbert perry as the servant leporello 
 
elsewhere in television 
dept of oh let them good times roll farrah fawcett and her 
true love ryan oneal are coming to cbs next year and in a 
thursday sitcom on jan 10 theyll premiere in good sports 
playing coanchors who dont get along at an allsports cable 
network called the all sports cable network moving right along 
now she plays a former top model now making a career in sports 
journalism oneal plays downtown bobby tannen identified by 
cbs as the former bad boy of pro football known for his quick

peculiarities some of them humiliating surrounded the coming 
of that child whose birth is celebrated at christmas the 
circumstances were strange and disturbing yet also commonplace 
it was not the tinseled decorative affair that characterizes 
the modern holiday yet odd strands of awe and wonder interwove the 
ordinary human behavior described in the records 
how shall this be asked a bewildered jewish girl mary 
when a transcendent message came to her that she would bear a 
divine son i have no husband 
the upshot synthesized from biblical accounts was this 
soon aware of her pregnancy the troubled girl temporarily left 
her parents home in nazareth to seek consolation from an older 
cousin in jerusalem staying three months before returning to 
nazareth 
a just local man to whom she had been engaged the carpenter 
joseph was bitterly upset at her condition in distress he at 
first intended to break off their marriage plans 
but the account says he decided to do so quietly being 
unwilling to put her to shame 
then at night tossing about in a dream in that veiled 
intermingling of grief compassion and conscience heavenly counsel 
came that mary had conceived by holy means and her son would save 
his people from their sins 
joseph rose from bed that day rejuvenated and glad and took 
mary as his wife 
but they had tough ordeals ahead even interludes of terror 
under the circumstances ancient nonbiblical accounts say gossip 
rimmed their union in nazareth 
in any case when notified he must go to bethlehem to register 
for occupying romes taxation joseph protectively took mary with 
him even in her late pregancy on that dusty 90mile trip 
tired and footsore they reached the town crowded with 
travelers soldiers and tradesmen her time had come and joseph 
sought desperately to find lodgings where the child could be 
delivered 
but the inn had no room perhaps advised by the innkeeper or 
some bystander joseph took his worried wife to a nearby 
cavernlike stable and made a pallet for her among tethered 
animals 
and she gave birth to her firstborn son 
it wasnt exactly a prepossessing place to enter the world a 
smelly dunglittered livestock stall not fancy for sure not 
glittery like the holiday but a shabby shelter for the homeless 
it was down with the least and lowliest that the child began 
life 
afterward roughclad shepherds showed up telling how while 
tending flocks in the valley below a glorious light had fallen on 
them as they trembled in fear an angelic voice assured 
be not afraid for behold i bring you good news of a great joy 
for to you is born this day in the city of david a savior who 
is christ the lord 
the account says the skies throbbed with sublime music glory 
to god in the highest and on earth peace among men 
in awestruck curiosity the shepherds went to the hilltop town 
finding the child as they had been told wrapped in swaddling 
cloths and lying in a manager 
after leaving they excitedly spread word of their experience 
among rustic comrades 
the family apparently settled temporarily in bethlehem at eight 
days the boy was circumcized and later dedicated at the temple in 
nearby jerusalem to gods service 
a year or more later the magi from the east who had discerned 
celestial signs of a preeminent birth appeared in jerusalem 
arousing suspicions of king herod 
after visiting the child and offering gifts they sought to 
throw herod off the trail by returning another way but it was then 
that the terror struck 
warned of it in a dream joseph roused his family and fled by 
night headed for safety into egypt behind them blades of herods 
troops fell on bethlehem toddlers in a pandemonium of screams and 
blood 
for a year or more joseph mary and the child remained as 
refugees in egypt finding whatever shelter and livelihood they 
could it was a time of uncertainty and hardship 
after herods death they returned to nazareth in upland 
galilee where the child grew into adulthood and a ministry that 
led to his crucifixion and ensuing resurrection 
his story from the beginning was humbly common yet most 
uncommon that child was fully human christians believe yet also 
fully divine in the human context very god of very god 
wild incredible some say misassuming that humanity negates 
godliness logically however to be perfectly consummately human 
to the utmost without flaw or failing must reflect that higher 
order the highest possible in earthly terms johns gospel says 
in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and 
the word was god and the word became flesh and dwelt among us 
full of grace and truth

its evidently going to take more than one bad 
year in the financial markets to dull investors voracious appetite 
for mutual funds 
thanks to such events as the crisis in the persian gulf and the 
onset of an economic slump just about all types of longterm funds 
have turned in poor performances for 1990 
all 14 categories of stock and bond funds monitored by the 
wiesenberger investment companies service showed declines in their 
average net asset values for the 12 months through nov 30 
yet sales of new fund shares to investors show no sign of 
flagging setting their strongest pace since the most ebullient 
days of the 1980s bull market 
through the first 10 months of this year reports the investment 
company institute the industrys main trade group sales of 
longterm funds as opposed to moneymarket and shortterm 
municipal bond funds came to 12518 billion 
that put them on the verge of surpassing the 12571 billion 
total recorded for all of 1989 
when fullyear figures are in they appear certain to rank as 
the third best ever behind only 1986 with sales of 21585 
billion and 1987 with 19063 billion 
an especially striking element of this years activity is that 
sales of stock funds have been running slightly ahead of bond and 
other income funds which represent a larger category 
that has happened even though the average equity funds net 
asset value dropped 107 percent over the last 12 months by 
wiesenbergers calculation 
indeed not since 1974 have such a preponderance of equity 
mutual funds shown a loss in any year observes reg green editor 
and publisher of the mutual fund news service in bodega bay calif 
steve norwitz a spokesman for the baltimore fundmanagement 
firm of t rowe price associates points out that business has been 
notably hot for international equity funds even though nearly all 
overseas stock markets also have fallen this year 
the ici numbers show international fund sales of 697 billion 
through the first 10 months this year more than four times the 
154 billion tally at the corresponding point in 1989 
what to make of all this bullishnessness in the face of 
adversity most analysts say it sends a clearcut message that fund 
investors are seizing on what they perceive as a buying 
opportunity 
the memory is still fresh in their minds analysts reason of 
the profits that awaited most people who stepped up to buy in the 
aftermath of the crash in 87 
some skeptics see this is as a danger sign typically they say 
bear markets dont bottom out until mutualfund investors have been 
scared away in large numbers 
optimistic observers by contrast say it could be a sign that 
fund investors have learned to think longerterm building up their 
holdings in good times and bad 
in either case keen enthusiasm among the public for funds may 
be at least partly offset by a wary mood among fund managers 
themselves at the end of october stock funds that report to the 
ici were keeping a record 129 percent of their assets in reserve 
parked in moneymarket investments 
never before have the funds had so much buying power argues 
norman fosback editor of the fort lauderdale flabased advisory 
mutual fund forecaster never before have fund managers been so 
bearish on the market as to hold such huge amounts of cash 
when portfolio managers are deeply bearish the market nearly 
always proves them wrong by moving sharply higher

it may not be as easy as it used to be to slow 
or reverse an economic decline 
recessions arent necessarily alike and what works on one might 
not on another like strains of flu they may vary vastly from 
their predecessors 
dealing with this one may be a particularly onerous task and 
the biggest problem already has been hinted at it is the poor 
financial condition of the banks themselves and their desire to 
keep matters from getting even worse 
while the federal reserve cut the discount rate or the rate at 
which the commercial banks borrow money from the central bank 
those banks seem less inclined than before to pass on those savings 
to borrowers 
that attitude could mess up the feds plans in fact to some 
extent it already has while the fed has lowered since summer by a 
full percentage point the overnight rate banks charge each other 
the banks havent lowered their rates to customers 
the entire idea of an easier federal reserve policy lowering 
interest rates or expanding the money supply is to spur 
commercial interaction by pumping money through the banks into the 
economy 
that is the expected remedy the routine antidote the aspirin 
for treating dangerous economic slides which the current one has 
become but if the banks let the buck stop with them wouldbe 
users of that money remain frustrated 
what makes this recession unlike many others according to those 
who have studied it is that it is primarily debtinduced much of 
that debt is owed to banks the banks cant collect it has put 
them in a dangerous position 
rather than pass on savings to customers therefore they have 
shown a tendency to hoard what funds they have they are also 
retrenching writing off billions of dollars of loans and closing 
many of their lending operations 
rather than putting money out in the form of loans they are 
trying to get rid of the loans they already have in many 
instances loans not written off entirely are packaged for sale at 
huge discounts just to get rid of them 
loans and customers got the banks into trouble they are licking 
their wounds they are declaring their primary goal now is 1 
survival and 2 clearing the books for the next upturn in which 
they vow to be more prudent 
the prime rate at major banks has been at 10 percent all year 
long and there isnt likely to be any rush to lower it 
substantially 
the earliest indication from a midwest bank is for a 
onequarter point drop which certainly doesnt qualify as 
dramatic except that any decline is rare these days 
creditstarved customers arent likely to leap at such a cut 
in fact those to whom the prime doesnt even apply 
homeowners for example might see more immediate results 
mortgage rates often are tied to government securities prices not 
to bank attitudes and could fall sharply 
that aspect of the feds easier money policy by itself could 
have a very meaningful consequence for the economy many homeowners 
are strapped and mortgage delinquencies are rising those with 
variable rates especially those with mortgages up for their 
periodic review could find quick relief 
the psychological factor also is important for many months the 
fed had steadfastly declined to let up on its tight money policies 
presumably because it considered inflation its no 1 enemy 
now that relief has finally come it may generate buying and 
selling activity among those individuals and companies that had 
been on the sidelines just the psychological attitude could be 
enough to produce some action 
thats how economies move ahead one positive step leading to 
another but dont rely too heavily on the banks its unlikely 
that theyll be the ones to step out ahead of the pack

sherman mccoy is a selfstyled master of 
the universe an ultimate wasp who moves like hotbuttered 
bourbon through the power houses and privileged lairs of new york 
city if he went any higher in life hed be god 
peter fallow is a rather rumpled shallow smarmy boozesoaked 
journalist who crawls through the sewers of the world struggling 
for that one last story if he went any lower in life hed be a 
drowned rat 
the worlds of mccoy tom hanks and fallow bruce willis 
combine in brian de palmas latest movie bonfire of the 
vanities and as mccoy falls from grace fallow ascends like the 
angels 
set in new york city the warner bros release takes some pretty 
rough jabs at manhattan socialites local politicians and 
selfstyled religious leaders the media and especially the bronx 
that longlamented stepchild of a borough 
it was bad enough in tom wolfes bestselling novel which 
explored the social legal and financial worlds of new york and 
found them to be rotten now its up there on the big screen with 
tom hanks bruce willis melanie griffith and morgan freeman 
involved in the nasty goingson 
michael christopher the witches of eastwick adapted 
wolfes book de palma also produced 
during filming earlier this year bronx borough president 
fernando ferrer protested what he considered the poor treatment of 
the borough as a burnedout ugly crimeridden heap and asked 
that a disclaimer run with the movie one does 
the plot revolves around mccoy a wall street bond trader whose 
dumb blonde married mistress maria melanie griffith backs 
mccoys mercedes into a black teenager while they are lost in the 
south bronx the youth falls into a coma and the police after 
getting part of the license plate from another teenager at the 
scene zoom in on sherman 
mccoy takes the rap for his mistress not knowing the political 
and racial circus in which he would become embroiled a district 
attorney with ambitions to be mayor played by f murray abraham 
seizes the incident to further his campaign a black activist 
minister john hancock joins in the circus with everyone else 
including fallow 
hanks willis and de palma were recently in los angeles to help 
ignite bonfire and they talked about the movies depiction of 
new york 
actually there were no actors in this movie they were all 
taken off the street cracked willis 
then seriously no its really a kind of sendup of the 
people of new york tom wolfe had an almost prescient vision of 
things to come he wrote some of the characters in the book even 
before they emerged in the media 
i think tom wolfes view as is brian depalmas view is a 
little tongueincheek i dont think hes saying this is what 
life is i think hes saying this is a kind of melodramatic view 
of it 
willis and his wife actress demi moore have bought an 
apartment in new york reportedly for 6 million and are spending 
even more money to refurbish it 
you gotta be a little bit nuts to live in new york willis 
said but theres no place like it that ive found 
remarked hanks i think theres accuracy in our depiction of 
new york city its not the beall and endall theres a policeman 
in the movie who says he works bruckner avenue in the bronx and 
park avenue in manhattan and theres good and bad in both 
places 
i think this movie is seeing much more of the bad in both 
places but not just for new york city but american society as a 
whole i think there is truth to be found in our depiction of the 
political system the justice system the clergy the economic 
system race relations the media 
de palma who has lived in new york for several years 
commented when youre shooting new york city youve got to 
avoid all the cliches when youre trying to deal with a comic 
styled land of the rich and famous youve got to find images that 
embody that we took on a kind of comic stylization 
the world depicted in bonire is very true to these 
particular characters building a huge case on another characters 
fall 
if new york takes its lumps in bonfire of the vanities the 
media is savaged willis scandalsheet reporter manufactures his 
stories 
has willis been the victim of such fabrication 
many times he said sadly i had it happen three or four 
times this past summer when i was in rome there were three or 
four stories written that were entirely fictional they must have 
included 25 quotes from me from my wife from two of my costars 
not one word of it was true 
after five years of such treatment willis has learned to stay 
cool i cant stop these things i can only control my reactions 
occasionally like now i can express my feelings otherwise i 
just accept it as part of the entertainment business 
hanks maintained that the swarming reporters and camera people 
of bonfire are not exaggerated to anyone who has come out of 
a courtroom after being convicted or acquitted its an 
intimidating process 
hanks has mostly escaped the scandal peddlers ive been there 
a couple of times but im just not the fodder not as 
interesting

gradually now comes the hurt to the children of chernobyl as 
the silent hidden blight starts appearing theyre beginning to 
get help from scattered groups of american christians 
the situation is bad and its going to get worse said the 
rev paul s moore whose new york city radio ministry citihope 
is raising money for medical supplies 
in a real way it means giving children back their lives he 
said 
a threatening shadow fell over inhabitants of the ukraine and 
byelorussia after the fiery rupture of a soviet nuclear plant on 
april 26 1986 at chernobyl filled the atmosphere with radioactive 
particles 
but only lately has the extent of the effects of that accident 
begun to appear with the impact increasing with time 
pyotr k kravchanka foreign affairs minister of the 
byelorussian republic on which 70 percent of the contamination 
settled said that at the outset the resulting volume of cancer and 
related cases could not be predicted 
we are now seeing only the beginning stage he said in an 
interview citing a doubling of thyroid ailments among children a 
sevenfold increase in anemia cases and a rise in leukemia cases 
the peak volume of sickness has not yet come he said 
scientists project the mounting toll will hit its high point in 
199697 he said but treatment is severely limited by a lack of 
medicine and diagnostic equipment 
a fifth of byelorussias population or 22 million people 
including 800000 children have become innocent victims of 
chernobyl the hostages of postponed effects of radiation he 
told the united nations general assembly 
as the disasters effects grow several small independent 
american religious and other groups as well as ethnic communities 
of byelorussians and ukrainians in some cities have begun limited 
steps to provide medical aid 
a catalyzing influence for such efforts resulted from moores 
visit in september to minsk capital of byelorussia where he 
observed firsthand the spreading marks of radiation to which 
children are most vulnerable 
you cant realize the gravity of it until you experience it 
until flesh touches your flesh and you go through the hospitals 
with the doctors and see the wasting bodies of the children he 
said most americans are not aware of the extent of the 
implications now and in the future 
he said he was told 37000 byelorussian children are being 
treated for precancerous conditions with more cases diagnosed 
daily but he added the supply of medicine is so inadequate that 
only 15 percent can be saved compared to the 85 percent who could 
be saved with sufficient medicine 
soviet pharmaceutical supplies limited and chiefly from east 
germany were said to have been disrupted by german reunification 
moore also an assistant minister at st georges church in 
manhattan said that through sponsorships enlisted on his radio 
ministry his project so far has supplied 650000 worth of 
methotrexate and other anticancer drugs and vitamins 
he said that as a result treatment has been started on 400 
byelorussian children and that by early january he expects to 
have rounded up enough medicine to increase that number to 1000 
moore said pharmaceutical companies will provide the drugs for 
such charitable purposes at 5 percent of costs meaning that the 
usual cost of 4000 to 5000 for two or three years of treatment 
to bring a cancerous condition into remission is reduced to 100 to 
200 per child 
the rev michael christensen of san franciscos hamilton united 
methodist church is coordinator of moores expanding project 
paul maxey associate executive director of interchurch medical 
assistance of new windsor md which serves 15 relief agencies as 
a liaison with drug companies in obtaining medicines for such 
causes said 
reaction to the chernobyl situation has been slow because of 
the incubation time before the effects show up churches have not 
been challenged to do much about it but it has now become a very 
distressing problem 
he said a few mostly local groups now are getting involved 
in richmond va the rev paul f mccleary director of the 
christian childrens fund said his group began sending aid to the 
soviets as a result of a factfinding trip with a virginia medical 
team to minsk in midnovember 
its a very grave situation he said adding that a 
prechristmas shipment of medicine was being assembled 
its a very large medical catastrophe and assistance is needed 
to improve the diagnosis process and start treatment earlier he 
said 
its the first instance of a major nuclear catastrophe 
something entirely new in the human experience its important that 
we monitor it and track the record so if another such event occurs 
we cope with it more properly 
its a very significant activity for us and all mankind

a christmas eve telecast involving troops in the 
persian gulf area christmas with the gulf is to be presented 
by the vision interfaith satellite network 
it said the exclusive program linking soliders in bahrain with 
families gathered at designated churches in england and germany 
was being made available to all cable television systems in the 
united states whether or not they are affiliated with visn 
jeffrey c weber programming and operations vice president 
said the hourlong special coproduced with the british 
broadcasting corporation is to be presented by visn at 10 pm est 
christmas eve and will be repeated at 130 pm est on christmas 
day 
the network is owned and operated by the notforprofit national 
interfaith cable coalition made up of 23 roman catholic jewish 
protestant and eastern orthodox faith groups 
 
dayton ohio ap united methodists on the average are older 
and better educated than americans as a whole and a majority of 
them at one time have been affiliated with another denomination a 
survey found 
responses from 758 lay members and 1003 clergy showed 376 
percent of the lay members and 50 percent of the clergy were older 
than 50 compared to 257 percent for the entire country 
for lay members 499 percent had completed at least four years 
of college while 929 percent of the clergy had done so that 
compared to 203 percent of the us population 
 
fort lauderdale fla ap the leadership council of the 
sisters of mercy criticized the us military buildup in the 
persian gulf as wasting human and material resources on a 
primitive method of conflict resolution 
at a meeting the roman catholic orders council added this 
expense is especially deplorable at a time when we along with 
others committed to education health care and social welfare are 
struggling and often failing to find the means of providing these 
basic human rights for an increasing number of people 
 
new york ap reform jewish leaders say the national council 
of churches caused us great pain by a statement equating iraqs 
invasion of kuwait with israels relationship with palestinians 
this plays into the hands of saddam hussein and his effort to 
escape responsibility for the rape of kuwait the interreligious 
affairs committee of the union of american hebrew congregations 
said in an open letter 
 
virginia beach va ap at the request of soviet television 
officials the christian broadcasting network is providing 27

christs birth to explain to their soviet auidience what 
christmas is all about 
the host of the show will be cbns founder and president pat 
robertson 
he said that the soviet networks also will broadcast another cbn 
special dont ask me ask god in january and that a cbn 
animated bible series superbook currently airs weekly in the 
soviet 
im frankly overwhelmed by the unbelievable spiritual hunger 
that exists in the soviet union robertson said adding in my 
wildest dreams i could not have conceived of the magnitude of the 
opportunity that has been presented to us

the youngest member of the 265th its just growing into one big 
family 
the 265th families are the seasoned veterans of the homefront 
each with stories about missed birthdays and anniversaries the 
treacheries of the family car the vagaries of military mails and 
the joy of unexpected phone calls from saudi arabia 
im just managing until hes home said joanne badger who 
has had to cope with the absence of her husband willie its 
hard 
harder still on christmas a time when the closeknit families 
of the small town are used to big celebrations 
its going to be a real quiet holiday said clevetta 
jackson wife of the 265ths commander sgt ronnie jackson we 
didnt even bother to put up a tree we usually make a big thing 
about that 
this is the first time in 20 years the mother of two has missed 
a christmas with her husband a forceful man who uses the word 
damn like a punctuation mark 
we used to complain about him being so loud she said now 
its so quiet around here we can hardly stand it 
adele harris will go to traditional dinner at her fathers 
house where several clans gather for the day but two important 
faces will be missing her husband henry a retired schoolteacher 
and her brother don graham a construction supervisor with seven 
children both are in the 265th 
everybodys trying to keep their chin up she said 
the 265ths families have filled the time with a new routine 
mailing off letters and packages and waiting in return for the 
letters and occasional phone calls from the men 
the gifts that went out from the allendale homes illustrate the 
hardships of life in the desert mrs rooker sent her son socks and 
long underwear to cut the chill of the desert at night he also got 
a pillow his art pad and a christmas tree mrs badger sent canned 
food to break the monotony of army chow everybody included 
christmas cookies and candies with the usual batteries newspapers 
and magazines 
while most of the wives write several times a week they also 
send videocassettes documenting sports and family events the men 
have missed the tapes are viewed by the men in a desert tent 
equipped with a videotape recorder hooked to a generator 
estella cohen sent her husband sgt hullie cohen a tape of 
their son playing football for the citadel other family members 
produced a christmas video complete with carols santa claus and a 
warning from mrs harris that her husband would face the wrath of 
santa claus if he didnt write 
we sang rudolph and silver bells she said we didnt 
do ill be home for christmas 
communication between the desert and the homefront has improved 
in the last few months letters sometimes arrive within a week the 
men have been able to call with some regularity 
the first thing he says is hes ready to come home said 
mrs cohen he said when i first left i was strong but now im 
ready to come home 
the homecoming is a major focus of the families plans already 
are being laid for a party that will include the one thing foremost 
on the mens minds beer 
well have plenty of it at the party but they might be too 
tired to drink it mrs badger said 
the 265th originally was called up for three months the callup 
was extended another three months in november which would mean a 
homecoming in february that could change if the united states goes 
to war 
the families prefer to believe they will see their men in two 
months rather than allowing their emotions to be roiled by the 
daily bulletins from baghdad and washington 
some would say theyve got a job to do and its in the lords 
hands said mrs rooker it still doesnt keep me from this 
deep feeling in my heart that mark has to come back 
at times it gets to you and you have to let it go once you 
cry it out you feel better

the aroma of southern fried chicken and 
the strains of dixie fill the air a confederate flag flutters 
in a warm breeze 
young women in colorful hoop skirts squaredance with partners 
dressed in the gray uniforms of the confederacy 
welcome to americana where descendants of rebels who fled the 
united states after the civil war hold an annual picnic to keep 
some of their traditions alive even though most of them dont 
speak english 
memories of the rebel past remain strong in this fertile 
sugarcane region 85 miles northwest of sao paulo brazils largest 
city 
in a graveyard at nearby santa barbara doeste about 400 
confederate settlers and some of their offspring are buried in the 
shade of pine eucalyptus mango and palm trees 
among them is the greatuncle of rosalynn carter wife of former 
president carter his epitaph reads 
to the memory of ws wise born in edgefield south carolina 
oct 13 1833 died in santa barbara brazil april 14 1877 
an inscription on another tombstone captures the defiance of 
those who came to brazil 
roberto stell steagall once a rebel twice a rebel and 
forever a rebel born sept 1899 died jan 1985 
steagalls paternal grandfather henry farrar steagall was a 
texan who served in gen robert e lees army and arrived in brazil 
in 1866 
wherever our ancestors settled they were warmly welcomed 
except at the local cemetery said judith macknight jones 75 
the communitys unofficial historian she is one of the few who 
speaks english complete with a drawl 
they were not allowed to bury their dead in the roman catholic 
cemeteries because they were all protestants so they built this 
one which also serves as a monmument to our heritage mrs jones 
said pointing to a concrete obelisk with four confederate flags 
engraved on it 
sitting at a picnic table watching the square dance was sydney 
mills a large man in a cowboy hat boots and leather vest who 
carried a riding crop mills 73 is nicknamed the texan 
ive been dressing like this for more than 30 years as a way 
to pay homage to my confederate ancestors mills said in 
portuguese his grandfather william thatcher mills came from 
dallas in 1866 to plant cotton in santa barbara doeste 
like mills most of the descendants know little of their family 
histories 
about 3500 southerners arrived between 1866 and 1890 to settle 
this southeastern region where the climate and soil are similar to 
the southeastern united states they introduced cotton the metal 
plow and the sewing machine 
many settlers could not adapt and nearly 3000 returned to the 
united states by the turn of the century mrs jones said 
most of the immigrants eventually moved to americana which grew 
up around the regions first railroad station built in 1875 the 
city now is known for textile mills 
today mrs jones said no more than 300 of the people living in 
or near this city of 160000 can trace their ancestry directly to 
confederate immigrants 
the total number of descendants in brazil is difficult to gauge 
some probably are unaware of their confederate ancestry others 
went elsewhere and there is no record of their numbers 
in 1967 mrs jones chronicled the confederate immigration in 
the book soldier rest a north american epic under brazilian 
skies she wrote it in portuguese but hopes for an english 
translation 
most of the civil war exiles were plantation owners she said 
but the group included teachers doctors lawyers businessmen and 
adventurers 
they came from all over the south alabama georgia texas 
south carolina and mississippi she said in an interview they 
all felt conditions under reconstruction would be unbearable so 
they decided to leave the old south and head for brazil 
the first immigrants arrived in 1866 drawn by reports from 
american protestant missionaries and the brazilian government that 
their knowledge of cotton farming was needed 
another attraction was the abundant slave labor available in 
brazil mrs jones said slavery was not abolished in brazil until 
1888 
initially the transplanted americans did not mix with the local 
residents integration and intermarriage with brazilians was 
frowned upon 
they had their own teachers doctors preachers and language 
to protect their values from outside influences mrs jones said 
the selfimposed segregation began crumbling in the early 1900s 
grandchildren of the settlers married outside the community and 
began to mix with brazilian culture 
besides the yearly picnic about 60 descendants meet every three 
months to keep in touch and exchange information on their 
ancestors

george what should i do should i make this gangster movie or 
shouldnt i francis ford coppola speaking to george lucas in 
1970

francis ford coppola is working around the 
clock pushing himself and his editors to get the latest 
godfather film into theaters by christmas he insists a spring 
release would be better but paramount pictures eyeing the 
deadline for the academy awards wants it out before the end of the 
year 
the movie is screened in san francisco and the projector breaks 
down four times four days later when the film is seen in seattle 
several scenes have been cut and many others added audience 
response is mixed 
the time is december 1974 and as a weary assistant gazes at a 
preview card he lets out an audible groan i hope there will be 
no godfather part iii responds the director so do i 
but its happening again coppola frantically editing paramount 
executives nervously waiting stories about onset blowups and 
lastminute switchesendless curiosity over this most lavish of 
christmas presents 
a new godfather film is hollywoods equivalent to a world 
tour by the rolling stones and its aura of money and power is 
something the corleones would have appreciated the two 
godfather movies have grossed 800 million and won nine academy 
awards between them 
but thats industry talk to moviegoers the godfather means 
brando and duvall pacino and de niro a bloodied horse head and a 
brotherly kiss on new years eve weddings and christenings death 
in a tomato garden bullets ripping through james caan at a toll 
booth 
to the artists it means fame revitalized careers marlon 
brando was washed up al pacino was an unknown stage performer 
coppola was a failed director hired because hed work cheap 
the stakes for the godfather part iii are enormous the 
budget reportedly topped 50 million and a flop could spell 
financial ruin for coppola he and his production company filed for 
bankruptcy protection from creditors during shooting listing 
assets of 222 million and debts of 289 million 
also paramount has struggled this year ghost was an 
enormous hit but both the two jakes and another 48 hrs 
flopped if critics dont take to the new godfather the studio 
could be shut out from the academy awards as it just was by the 
new york and los angeles film critics associations which both 
named another mafia movie goodfellas as best picture 
coppola has compared the corleones to the kennedys tragic 
american dynasties people care about vito sonny michael and 
connie 
mario puzos the godfather came out in 1969 to mixed 
reviews and with complaints from the italianamerican civil rights 
league that the book reinforced stereotypes 
but the novel quickly topped the new york times bestseller 
list and within two years of its first printing 10 million copies 
had been purchased puzo the son of illiterate italian immigrants 
sold the film rights to paramount for 85000 
 
coppola oh yeah let me tell you something about coppola 
coppola would make a great producer you know hes a hustler hes 
got all this talk and chachacha but hes no director 
producer albert ruddy before making the godfather 
 
paramount wanted a lowbudget film an easy profitmaker and 
envisioned a christmas 1971 release ruddy who had worked on tvs 
hogans heroes was assigned to produce for director he 
sought peter yates bullitt who declined and then 
costagavras z who also said no 
ruddy then called on coppola a 32yearold director whose last 
two films had bombed paramount burned by such bigbudget failures 
as catch 22 and paint your wagon needed someone it could 
control also as ruddy noted coppola was an italian who knew 
the way these men ate their food kissed each other talked 
coppola deeply in debt reluctantly accepted the budget was to 
come in under 2 million 
 
i assure you that marlon brando will never appear in this 
film paramount president stanley jaffe 
 
puzo and coppola worked on a screenplay and the director began 
casting caan an old friend of coppolas who had appeared in the 
directors the rain people was quickly chosen to play sonny 
corleone robert duvall also in the rain people was an easy 
choice for consigliere tom hagen 
for michael corleone paramount insisted on a star preferably 
robert redford or warren beatty coppola had his eyes on al pacino 
an offbroadway actor of silician descent the studio objected 
pacinos screen tests were poor he was too short too 
inexperienced and ironically looked too italian but the director 
wouldnt budge and paramount anxious to get shooting under way 
gave in 
the casting of family patriarch vito corleone could only be 
compared to finding the perfect scarlett coppola interviewed every 
old italian actor he could find no one was good enough 
age ruddy and coppola decided didnt matter they simply 
needed a great actor they considered sir laurence olivier but he 
was too ill they also considered brando who puzo had in mind when 
he wrote the character 
the brooding star of a streetcar named desire and on the 
waterfront was then 47 and better at emptying studio coffers than 
filling them it had been years since he had had a hit and budgets 
had soared for his last movies reportedly because of onset battles 
between brando and his directors 
executives wanted nothing to do with him coppola persisted 
paramount agreed to give him a chance but set three conditions 
one brando would receive no salary only a percentage two the 
actor had to guarantee with his own money that he would not cause 
the film to go over budget three he would have to take a screen 
test something he was as likely to do as submit to an interview 
brando agreed to all three for his screen test the actor put 
on a fake mustache slicked back his hair with shoe polish and 
stuffed kleenex in his mouth he got the part 
some italian actors protested the casting of nonitalians 
brando caan and duvall and the iacrl proved as demanding as 
paramount it staged a rally hosted by frank sinatra at madison 
square garden to raise funds to stop the film threatened labor 
disruptions on the set and insisted there was no such thing as the 
mafia 
ruddy promised to keep the words mafia and cosa nostra 
out of the film the words are back in for the godfather part 
iii he also agreed to attend a testimonial dinner hire league 
members as bit players and extras and donate new yorks 
openingnight box office to the leagues hospital fund 
with publicity building and coppolas wheels turning the budget 
was increased to 62 million

filming started march 29 1971 coppola had requested an 80day 
shooting schedule but paramount would only give him 53 with time 
so short scenes were rushed and the dailies came out poorly it 
was rumored coppola would be replaced by elia kazan who had twice 
directed brando the actor helped put an end to such talk by 
insisting he would stop working if coppola was fired 
director of photography gordon willis frustrated with coppolas 
inexperience walked off the set at one point crew members mocked 
talia shire coppolas sister as incompetent the directors 
obsession with retakes drove everyone crazy and a rebellious 
paramount editor was fired 
at first everybody was so uptight francis was a wreck and 
pacino looked like he was going to die said caan who helped 
lighten the mood by cracking jokes with duvall and mooning brando 
on the set 
shooting fell behind schedule and the release date was pushed 
back to easter 1972 the final budget approached 7 million 
the finished movie ran for three hours and stayed that way 
despite complaints from the studio it was first seen in late 
february and most exhibitors who saw it were unimpressed 
on march 11 1972 the godfather opened in new york and all 
was forgiven critics raved and fans poured in there were 
godfather games and godfather soundtracks shouts of make 
him an offer you cant refuse the corleone way of doing 
business were heard from playgrounds to advertising offices 
it was one of those rare films in which every shot seemed to 
have been lovingly crafted the simplest dialogue took on 
additional meaning and even the most minor character had depth and 
personality 
brando had the most memorable role but pacinos michael was the 
center of the movie all the horror and beauty of the godfather 
can be seen in his transformation from an awkward college graduate 
to a cool ruthless mob boss becoming more confident and skillful 
on the outside as his soul burns inside 
michael corleone is one of hollywoods great tragic figures his 
rise and fall comparable to orson welles charles foster kane in 
citizen kane and broderick crawfords willie stark in all the 
kings men 
and like the maltese falcon the godfather had plenty 
to say about the stuff that dreams are made of the films final 
shot a door closing on diane keaton as pacino and associates 
scheme for the future recalls the conclusion of the maltese 
falcon a closeup of elevator doors closing on mary astor as the 
police take her away 
the following march brando won an oscar for best actor and the 
movie won best picture and best screenplay four months later 
paramount announced a sequel with coppola to write and direct 
the godfather part ii alternates between chronicling vitos 
early years and michael in middle age pacino duvall keaton and 
shire returned caan who had been murdered in the first film 
appeared in a flashback sequence brando was not in the sequel 
paramount was furious at him for turning down the oscar in protest 
of hollywoods treatment of american indians and the two sides 
couldnt agree to terms 
to play the young vito corleone coppola selected robert de 
niro who had attracted considerable attention for his role as a 
dying baseball player in bang the drum slowly willis 
apparently thinking more highly of the director was behind the 
cameras 
shooting began in september 1973 and dragged on for eight 
months the budget was a cool 13 million more than double what it 
was supposed to cost 
 
my father assured him either his brains or his signature would 
be on the contract michael corleone explaining how vito 
helped a singer to get a nightclub owner to release him from a 
contract 
 
the godfather part ii another threehour job was released 
in december and reviews were mixed 
still interest was strong enough to bring in millions at the 
box office and six oscars including best film best director 
best screenplay best supporting actor de niro and best score to 
coppolas father carmine 
paramount was already considering the next godfather film 
with or without the troublesome director 
while coppola floundered churning out such flops as rumble 
fish and one from the heart the studio plotted in 1977 
charles bludhorn chairman of gulf amp western industries 
paramounts parent company met with director richard brooks 
blackboard jungle and gave him a 53page treatment for the 
godfather iii brooks wasnt interested 
bludhorn collaborated on a script with puzo novelist vincent 
patrick who wrote the pope of greenwich village and dean 
reisner of dirty harry fame took a shot at it john travolta 
was going to star or maybe sylvester stallone 
in 1988 rumors circulated that coppola was in italy working on 
could it be the godfather part iii a year later they 
were confirmed coppola was back so were pacino keaton and shire 
willis was there too as was carmine coppola for the score 
 
i could make five failures five pictures nobody liked and 
id still be the guy who directed the godfather francis ford 
coppola 
 
andy garcia who plays sonnys outofwedlock son seem the 
best bet to come out a winner with the new movie to do a 
pacino and become a major star pacino and keaton are 
established actors reenacting familiar roles 
sofia coppola the directors daughter is a risk an 
inexperienced actress she was a lastminute substitute for winona 
ryder and has a key role as michaels daughter and garcias love 
interest so far reaction to her performance has been negative 
then theres the director himself beyond all the talk of money 
and awards the saga of the corleones is also the saga of coppola 
the godfather is an accidental classic but was that film just 
a fluke for coppola does he have anything left to say about the 
corleones 
the artists worst fear is that hell be exposed as a sham 
coppola said back in 1975 ive heard it from actors directors 
everyone deep down were all living with the notion that our 
success is beyond our ability

the movie event of the year the godfather 
part iii hits the nations screens on christmas day with the 
expectation that francis ford coppola will again prove godfather to 
actors careers 
he did it with the first two sagas of the corleone family 
restoring marlon brando to greatness and establishing al pacino and 
robert de niro as superstars 
the obvious candidate for the bigtime from the new film is andy 
garcia who plays sonny corleones outofwedlock son he has 
already delivered strong supporting performances in the 
untouchables black rain and internal affairs previewers 
of godfather iii seem to agree that garcia has arrived 
there was less agreement about sofia coppola as mary corleone 
the dons daughter when winona ryder was unable to fulfill the 
role coppola made the controversial casting of his own daughter 
her only previous acting came in her fathers films early reaction 
has been fairly negative for sofia some of whose lines had to be 
relooped because of her valley girl voice 
most of the cast are alumni of the previous godfathers 
pacino diane keaton talia shire or established character actors 
such as eli wallach joe montegna raf vallone helmut berger the 
new film could revive the career of george hamilton and boost 
brigid fonda and franc dambrosio the opera singer making his film 
debut as pacinos son 
the godfather was a 1972 phenomenon not only because it 
amassed more money than any previous film but also for its 
starmaking capacities pacino who had made only one previous film 
panic in needle park became an immediate star the same was 
true with diane keaton in her second film after looking for mr 
goodbar 
robert duvall had been playing smaller roles since to kill a 
mockingbird in 1964 his role as the consigliere elevated him to 
stardom both keaton and duvall went on to win academy awards 
james caan was already a popular actor but his role as the 
hotheaded sonny corleone in the first two films provided a big 
boost 
coppolas sister talia shire might be called the queen of the 
sequels she has appeared in all three godfathers as the 
corleone daughter and as rocky balboas wife in the five 
rockys 
the godfather part ii brought robert de niro the oscar as 
supporting actor and broadened a career that appeared stuck in 
smallbudget crime movies the film also initiated an acting career 
for the legendary acting teacher lee strasberg john cazale 
returned as fredo the weak member of the corleone family his 
career was cut short by cancer 
among the other godfather actors who have died strasberg 
sterling hayden richard castellano john marley richard conte 
besides pacino keaton and shire richard bright has appeared in 
all three films as the henchman al neri al martino skipped no ii 
but returns in the godfather part iii as the flamboyant crooner

the road home for the homeless is long and 
strewn with hurdles here is one mans struggle to escape the box 
that had been his home for a year and take inventory of what was 
left of his life 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the car waited for kevin brown its motor 
idling inside the heater blasted warm seductive air the car was 
there to take him to a home with real walls and real doors to a 
room of his own to a new life or a chance to reclaim his old 
one 
for the past year brown had lived under a highway in a box 
fashioned of cardboard and plywood this was the day hed been 
waiting for moving day 
the slide into homelessness has been wellchronicled but 
advocates for the homeless say theres a lesstold story the 
struggle to get off the street and kevin brown had made it 
but outside the car with the temperature just above freezing 
his 29yearold girlfriend pat sat in the darkness next to the box 
that had been their shared home for eight months she sobbed 
hunched over rocking ever so slightly and feverishly sucked her 
thumb 
pat was the only thing keeping brown from spending his first 
night indoors in more than a year from taking a hot bath from 
being able to shut a door an act so simple but one he 
desperately craved 
because she had left her home to live with him brown said he 
felt responsible for pat who declined to give her last name 
if they were to be separated he going to the residence to 
which he had been struggling to gain admission and she to a womens 
shelter he first wanted to make sure she was safe 
but when she refused to go he became resolute about leaving 
im not going to pass up this opportunity said brown 28 
i been homeless way before she even thought about being homeless 
now is my big chance she cant stop it she cant stop it 
he bolted from the station wagon and ran into the thicket of 
boxes tarps and leantos along the hudson river that are home to 
about 15 people on an abandoned stretch of road under the west side 
highway 
i think hes tired said jonnie scott one of three city 
social workers inside the car hes tired and he wants to change 
his life he wants to be somebody 
 
advocates for the homeless say one of the biggest problems 
confronting those who want to find a permanent place to live is the 
tremendous amount of sophisticated bureaucratic maneuvering 
required by government agencies 
the system they argue forces people already overloaded with 
problems to submit applications fill out forms make followup 
phone calls and have patience and faith in a process that requires 
large amounts of both 
its an absolute act of heroism that someone is able to get 
out of a box said carol fennelly spokeswoman for the community 
for creative nonviolence in washington dc founded by the late 
mitch snyder it shelters about 1400 men women and families 
they have such a hard time getting back to a regular place 
because they have no place to take showers no place to get mail 
no place to get phone calls she said 
but the bureaucracy is necessary to ensure the homeless are sent 
to the right shelter or home said ray diaz deputy commissioner of 
special services for adults in new york whose various agencies 
decide the fates of people like brown 
brown a former construction worker who once earned 22 an hour 
was homeless for a year after spending his rent money on his 
cocaine addiction his quest to get into renas residence for 
adults began in june when he happened to walk by the home and 
spotted a sign in the window 
the harlem residence is funded by the city and state and can 
accommodate 99 men and women the citys human resources 
administration governs who is admitted which means that once 
renas recommends a candidate the persons file must be submitted 
to the labyrinthine city bureaucracy 
brown said he made five visits over the course of getting his 
application approved although he said he sometimes felt he was 
getting the runaround he was determined to be patient 
i knew deep in my heart this is what i needed brown said 
so i always just said ok i can wait 
rena chinhenzva who runs the residence says it targets those 
looking for a permanent way out of homelessness and not just a warm 
room for the night she tries to help her residents enroll in 
vocational schools or if they want get their high school 
diplomas 
we want to give them back their pride chinhenzva said 
the problem of getting people off the streets and into a place 
of their own is exacerbated by the publics increasing feelings of 
futility over the issue of homelessness said gary blasi president 
of the national coalition for the homeless and a legal aid 
foundation attorney in los angeles 
there is just a certain level of weariness blasi said if 
people dont have a sense that things are getting better after 
awhile they just give up and then they turn their attention to 
things like saudi arabia 
so while troops mass in the hot desert sand he said more and 
more men women and children will be gathering on americas icy 
sidewalks 
the forecast for the homeless this winter is about as cold as 
it ever has been he said 
 
brown came back and after about 20 minutes pat climbed into 
the back of the car she was sobbing and gasping convulsively all 
the while keeping her right thumb firmly planted in her mouth 
i dont want to stay in a shelter she said haltingly 
scott had gone for a walk with pat and persuaded her to go to a 
womens shelter at least for the night a particularly cold 
middecember evening pat had not submitted an application to 
renas 
one of the reasons pat was so distraught brown said was 
because he had worked hard to make their makeshift home 
comfortable 
the box about the size of a volkswagen bus was insulated by 
used carpets thrown on top electricity tapped from a nearby 
streetlight powered a black and white television with a bulb 
inside that created enough heat to keep them warm brown said 
meals were made over a hearth of cinderblocks a nearby fire 
hydrant offered running water and they took sponge baths inside 
the box a bucket was their toilet in an openair area outside the 
box sat a kitchen table decorated with a bouquet of wilted flowers 
inside a juice jar 
if it wasnt under a highway it all might be considered cozy

many americans deny firsthand knowledge of 
homelessness and blame it mainly on tough breaks or bad economic 
luck an associated press poll has found 
a majority of the respondents 54 percent say their knowledge 
of the homeless is based on news reports or word of mouth fewer 
than half say their knowledge of the homeless is a result of 
something they have seen or dealt with in person 
only 15 percent know someone who has become homeless in the last 
year that measure of americans scant firsthand knowledge of the 
problem holds true for all income groups and drops to 10 percent 
in nonmetropolitan areas and to 7 percent among americans over 65 
yet polls over the years have shown americans want the 
government to do more to help the homeless in january for 
example a cbs newsnew york times poll found 71 percent saying the 
bush administration had not shown enough concern 
in the current poll 58 percent said federal spending on helping 
the homeless should be increased that is not a significant change 
from the 60 percent who provided the same answer in a media 
generalassociated press poll in november 1988 
this time 75 percent of those who wanted increased spending 
said they would be willing to pay more taxes for it compared with 
86 percent two years ago 
the overall acceptance rate for a tax increase to help the 
homeless has dropped from 52 percent to 44 percent perhaps because 
of the economic downturn 
one out of seven americans rate as likely the chances that they 
or a member of their family could become homeless in the coming 
year but only 4 percent rated it very likely and 67 percent rated 
it not at all likely 
the total answering very likely or somewhat likely was 19 
percent in the south and west compared with 5 percent in the 
northeast and 14 percent in the northcentral states it was 20 
percent for women compared with 9 percent for men 
a gender gap also showed up in measuring attitudes toward the 
homeless 
among men 21 percent agreed that the homeless themselves are 
mainly at fault becaue of their unwillingness to work or their 
behavior such as alcohol or drug use only 13 percent of the 
women agreed making the overall total 17 percent 
twenty percent of men and 21 percent of women agreed that our 
society is mainly at fault because we do not provide sufficient 
housing for them 
thirtyeight percent of the men and 45 percent of the women said 
a third statement best reflected their attitude neither the 
homeless nor society is mainly at fault because they become 
homeless through tough breaks or bad economic luck 
overall 41 percent agreed with the toughluck explanation of 
homelessness while 17 percent volunteered the answer that both the 
homeless and society are mainly at fault for the problem 
the survey of 1004 adults was conducted dec 59 by icr survey 
research group of media pa part of aus consultant cos 
the poll used a randomsampling method that generally should 
produce results accurate to within three percentage points when 
responses are broken down by age groups or income categories the 
margin of error increases as the subgroups get smaller

the associated press poll on homelessness was 
conducted by telephone dec 59 among a random sample of 1004 
adults in the contiguous united states interviewing was done by 
icr survey research group of media pa 
the results were weighted to adjust for variations in the 
sample the poll had a threepoint margin of sampling error 
meaning that 19 of 20 times its findings should be within three 
points of the result if every adult american were asked the same 
questions the error margin is larger for subgroups 
there are other sources of potential error in polls including 
the wording and order of questions these are the questions in this 
poll because of rounding sums may not total 100

man has been called the only animal that laughs 
television the only machine and 1990 was the year that canned 
laughter the use of prerecorded hilarity in the tv comedy sound 
track turned 40 years old 
like many 40yearolds the laugh track didnt need or want to 
be reminded of its age or that it first appeared on the hank 
mccune show an unremembered filmed sitcom that made its debut 
on nbc on sept 9 1950 
the hank mccune show was about an amiable bumbler who 
created chaos wherever he went its home audience seated at the 
electronic hearth heard the unmistakable sound of an audiences 
laughter if they noticed it at all 
all was not what it seemed 
the show noted the trade newspaper variety has an innovation 
in a sound track that contains audience laughter although the show 
is lensed on film without a studio audience there are chuckles and 
yocks dubbed in 
whether this induces a jovial mood in home viewers is still to 
be determined but the practice may have unlimited possibilities if 
its spread to include canned peals of hilarity thunderous 
ovations and gasps of sympathy 
and spread it has to the early producers the laugh track 
seemed as reasonable as the claque paid applauders who pack a 
theater to heat up an audiences response to the show 
radio comedies had never had that problem their actors usually 
were big stars who performed at microphones on bare stages in front 
of studio audiences that had come prepared to laugh 
but producing filmed comedy for the hungry new medium meant 
using sound stages where audiences could not fit the laugh track 
synthesized audience reaction and cued the audience however 
ungently when something was funny 
if theres one basic truth in show biz said pat weaver the 
thenpresident of nbc the one basic truth is nobody knows what 
the audience reaction is going to be to any project until it is 
actually played 
weaver said the laugh track was predicated on the psychological 
fact that people are more inclined to laugh when they are among 
people who are laughing 
not that i was in favor of laugh tracks weaver addedthe 
idiots that were running the programs all got carried away even if 
they were really good comedies he said 
i was in favor of a laugh track that was intelligently used 
he said that was the way it started and the way it should have 
continued 
it didnt 
technology evolved to the postproduction laugh machine 
where a technician could mix the audible range of human reactions 
from snort chuckle and giggle to guffaw belly laugh and roar into 
an audiences silence 
a skilled technician could play the laugh machine like a 
musician exhorting the canned peals of hilarity thunderous 
ovations and gasps of sympathy into a symphony of synthetic 
response 
the machine will love it and well fix it in post became 
stock excuses for a gag that fell short or worse an unfunny 
script 
even i love lucy where lucille ball and desi arnaz 
virtually invented the threecamera sitcom filmed before a live 
audience sweetened its laugh track with canned yocks when the 
audience got cold 
theres no question that we have been conditioned to the sound 
of laughter said george schlatter executive producer of the 
comedy series laughin which premiered in 1968 its now a 
science you cant tell when its a track 
whether thats improving the quality of television is the real 
question and i dont think so he said 
this from a man who once took a collection of political speeches 
and dubbed laughs music and applause under it it was 
wonderful i was going to market it but my lawyers said they would 
throw themselves under the car 
laughin was blisteringly paced blackout comedy series that 
redefined television comedy it was filmed for the most part 
before a studio audience and it was the laugh tracks finest hour 
because the bits were so short and we did so many of them 
in order to get more jokes per minute we many times removed the 
laughs schlatter said 
on laughin electronic editing was perfected because the 
cuts were made so fast that we no longer could make physical 
splices he said and me with my perverse sense of humor id 
put in laughs where there were none 
james komack executive producer of the hit sitcom welcome 
back kotter and many others made sure each of his shows had a 
different laugh track 
with the courtship of eddies father it was a very light 
track almost like music komack said with chico and the man 
and welcome back kotter both filmed before a studio audience 
most of the time what you heard was the laughter of the audience 
the exception is when the director cuts into a scene forcing 
the audio engineers to blend different sound tracks together using 
laughter rather than ambient noise makes for a seamless 
transition between different takes 
if you ever try to do a show without a laugh track youll see 
a huge difference komack said it flattens the only way to 
get away from a laugh track is to use music which can indicate 
when something is funny 
sweetening is still employed on those days when a great 
script and a hot cast collide with a cold audience komack said 
then its determined by the taste of the producers by the 
morality of the producers komack said after a while you 
learn that its valueless in the extremes people are going to 
hear it and say why are they laughing and theyll turn off your 
program 
komack also cited his experience as an actor and writer in the 
threeyear run of jackie coopers series hennesey which began 
in 1959 in its third year on the air cooper decided to ax the 
laugh track 
it was a brave artistic very clever very creative 
marvelous show and it got canceled komack said 
the critical question these days is whether a quality series can 
survive without canned laughter critics loved recent laugh 
trackless shows like the slap maxwell story and franks 
place but the show didnt last 
apparently we americans tend to get nervous if we sit alone with 
the tv laughing in the dark 
as schlatter put it genuine wit doesnt really need the 
machine the audience does 
and let the record reflect that the hank mccune show went 
off the air just three months after its premiere

anna maria horsford knew the role all too 
well before she auditioned to play veronica perry the mother of a 
young black man killed by a new york policeman 
the victims mother and miss horsford were classmates in junior 
high school the actress acquaintance with the perry family led 
her to reject the way her role had been drawn for the nbc movie 
best intentions the education and killing of edmund perry 
which will air in late january or early february 
perry an honors graduate of phillips exeter academy was due to 
attend stanford university when he was shot to death june 12 1985 
by an undercover policeman in new yorks morningside park the 
policeman said perry 17 and his brother jonah then 19 attacked 
him and tried to rob him 
miss horsford who stars on nbcs amen attended wadleigh 
junior high school in harlem with mrs perry she had never met 
edmund but knew of his educational promise she also has been a 
contributor to the better chance program that enabled edmund to 
attend the exclusive private school phillips exeter 
id been keeping in touch through a teacher at wadleigh 
miss horsford said i was so thrilled when edmund was chosen for 
the program veronica had two bright boys and a daughter in the 
program but knowing a person doesnt mean you know the inner 
workings of the mind 
not until i got the script did i learn the details she really 
pushed her kids she didnt ask what they wanted thats no crime 
id probably do the same thing i have a nephew in the program and 
i was pushing and my sister was pushing 
when miss horsford auditioned it was suggested she play mrs 
perry like a stage mother 
they didnt know at the time i knew her she said i 
closed the script and said no i said you cant say that about a 
mother trying to teach her kids about racism i said she was a 
successful woman in her own right what did i mean by that i said 
she had three children by the same man her husband and where i 
come from thats success 
there are so few roles that get to the depths of a woman 
especially a black woman you dont see many of us on the screen i 
think you have an obligation to fill in all the strengths and all 
the weaknesses i dont care what the color is we all have flaws 
many people dont know that what theyre doing may not be seen 
as correct she pushed her children but a mother wants the best 
for her children you have to see her life and goals through her 
eyes 
miss horsford said that after she got the role she was troubled 
by doubts about the official version of the shooting 
i didnt want to be part of a situation that eddie did this 
crime and that hes responsible she said then one morning i 
got up and said its right to feel that uncomfortable because im 
playing the mother use that discomfort not my son 
the movie also stars taurean blacque as the father jonah perry 
sr curtis mcclarin a edmund perry georg stanford brown as a 
teacher and christopher barnes as edmunds friend kevin hooks 
directed on location in new york from a screenplay by richard 
wesley based on the book by robert sam anson 
when we filmed in harlem the boys mother came down miss 
horsford said we hadnt seen each other in a long time we 
talked about everything but the reason we were there i met the 
other two kids we tried very hard to deal with the present we 
were shooting the movie but we didnt talk about it 
the only thing i didnt say that i wanted to say was how sorry 
i was but i was so happy that i was playing her rather than 
someone who didnt know the nuances 
miss horsford was interviewed on the set of amen which has 
returned after nbc took it off the air at the end of last season 
she was rehearsing a scene with sherman hemsley who plays her 
father deacon ernest frye 
the show ended as horsfords character thelma frye married the 
rev reuben gregory played by clifton davis 
i went from being the vampy virgin to the oversexed 
newlywed she said laughing 
thelmas the same but shes happy shes starting to find 
little faults with her husband

it is a bittersweet season in america a pause at the edge of 
war the nation has embraced hostages newly released soldiers soon 
to depart and memories of those already gone to the persian gulf 
with some urgency families have drawn especially close in the 
knowledge that neither home for the holidays nor peace on earth can 
be presumed 
theres anxiety and loneliness said patricia enninga whose 
son is in the persian gulf with the armys 82nd airborne division 
people are trying to grab onto whatever they can but 
everything keeps changing 
saddam hussein says he wont let go of kuwait president bush 
stands firm behind his line in the sand between them lies jan 15 
the date after which the united nations has approved the use of 
force against iraq 
and in the balance are the families of 440000 us troops some 
of whom already are in saudi arabia 
were in a state of limbo said mrs enninga of brooklyn 
center minn who counsels families through support our countrys 
military no one likes that feeling no one likes not knowing 
a halfcentury ago president franklin roosevelt tried to soothe 
similarly anxious americans as adolf hitler drew the nation into 
world war ii 
mankind is all one and what happens in distant lands 
tomorrow will leave its mark on the happiness of our christmases to 
come roosevelt said in an address on christmas eve 1940 
but for most of us it can be a happy christmas if by happiness 
we mean that we have done with doubts that we have set our hearts 
against fear 
on the eve of 1991 however ours is not a nation resolved 
the question i hear being asked is is the risk worth it 
and i dont know what the answer is i just know i keep hearing the 
question being asked over and over again said bill drengler an 
attorney with the national guard in wasau wis 
drengler who opposed the vietnam war joined the guard 18 
months ago out of a sense of duty to his country now he is 
spending the holiday season helping members of mobilizing units put 
their legal affairs in order 
most of the time that means helping people write their 
wills drengler said its difficult in a fleeting moment to 
wonder whether youre going to be sharing the holidays with your 
family a year from now 
operation desert shield has prompted countless newspaper columns 
and letters to the editor cartoonist garry trudeau says his 
readers apparently havent minded his comic strips persian gulf 
focus and radio talkshow hosts cant get their listeners off the 
topic 
prayer vigils and other demonstrations for a peaceful end to the 
conflict take place one day in fort wayne ind another in 
lawrence kan the next in casper wyo 
in just as many towns merchants pack up morale boosters for 
troops in saudi arabia books food of all kinds designer 
sunglasses cologne even a complete ballfield lighting system 
families send tons of letters videotaped messages regulation 
socks photos cookies prayers 
already sobered by a deepening economic downturn americans are 
reflecting on what a bloody war in a faroff desert could mean 
its an interesting moment for the country because it reflects 
a kind of maturity said todd gitlin a sociologist at the 
university of california at berkeley i certainly havent 
detected much gungho feeling on anyones part there is doubt 
built in and that in many ways is healthy 
recent polls have found americans split on whether the united 
states should take military action if saddam doesnt withdraw from 
kuwait by jan 15 bushs overall gulf policy has received mixed 
reviews 
in the beginning my son and i both believed we were there for 
a reason now its getting foggy said elaine smith of 
pittsburgh mother of marine lance cpl scott schmeltz i dont 
want him there i want him home with me 
surrounded by five kids ages 7 to 14 brenda mabey is doing her 
best to make their holiday cheerful but she is without husband 
gary who has been called to duty with the wyoming air national 
guard 
still stateside his phone calls have kept her going but when 
her husband has gone overseas who will offer such reassurances 
i spent all day decorating the house for christmas and i 
was blue i was standing by the tree and gary called mrs mabey 
said i lay on the couch and bawled for an hour on his shoulder 
he listened and said i know sweetheart youll be all right 
hang in there 
for the coles too it is a poignant yuletide season john cole 
an oil worker was among the human shields held 4 months in 
iraq saddams early december decision to release his foreign 
hostages came as an unexpected gift 
but the coles havent mounted a tree in their odessa texas 
home and there are no plans for a big holiday meal or caroling 
the family is not yet done dealing with the gulf crisis 
last year wasnt great because we had a son in panama who was 
shooting and being shot at come christmastime now the same boy is 
in saudi arabia due to start shooting and be shot at said mrs 
cole whose son shipped out with the army shortly after iraq 
invaded kuwait on aug 2 
its a very unhappy adult world that we live in she said 
but perhaps most heartbreaking are the children who this year 
have been touched by the swirling stuff of politics and world 
events 
it sometimes gets sad and lonely said 9yearold ben 
munyon who has been cared for by a baby sitter since his parents 
were deployed to saudi arabia in august i just write them i get 
my picture off the wall and hold it sometimes i fall asleep like 
that 
dear george bush wrote jamille byrd a 7thgrader from 
killeen texas whose father is in saudi arabia we need our 
mothers fathers and friends home for christmas

william gates chief executive of microsoft 
corp is personally seeking to purchase the electronicimaging 
rights to thousands of wellknown paitings and photographs a 
published report said today 
the reported move by the 35yearold trendsetter in the high 
technology field would follow a recent flurry of acquisitions by 
international conglomerates of the rights to movie and music 
archives 
the buyers feel those archives could provide royalties from 
distribution as well as programming for hardware such as video and 
compact disk players 
the wall street journal said gates said he hasnt bought any 
rights yet but it quoted people negotiating with him as saying he 
wants to lay the foundation for a library of electronic 
stillimages that could be licensed to future entertainment 
systems 
the story said gates has quietly pursued the venture he is 
calling interactive home systems and declined to say how much he is 
investing in it 
he was quoted by the newspaper as saying his immediate goal is 
to produce a pilot database of about 10000 images before deciding 
whether to compile a more extensive library of one million images 
the story said those familiar with his plans say he is 
considering using the images to support educational programs and 
for use in entertainment packages to be displayed on bigscreen tvs 
in the home 
gates formed his venture more than a year ago to study the 
commercial prospects of electronic images the company has four 
employees and is entirely funded by gates 
he was quoted by the journal as saying the venture remains 
speculative we may do it we may not do it

the us economy was still growing at a weak 
14 percent annual rate from july through september the government 
said today but most economists believe it since has slipped into a 
recession 
the commerce department reported its final estimate of the 
thirdquarter gross national product was even slower than its 
initial estimates it first said in october that the gnp had inched 
up 18 percent but revised that downward to 17 percent last month 
in another report the department said housing starts jumped 93 
percent in november their first increase in 10 months but the 
gain was due entirely to a rebound in multifamily starts as 
singlefamily building fell to a level unmatched since the 198182 
recession 
the federal reserve board noted the weakness in the economy 
tuesday when it lowered the discount rate from 7 percent to 65 
percent effective today to stimulate growth and ease the severity 
of any contraction 
but most economists say it will take months before the effects 
of a lower rate work their way through the economy the rate is the 
interest the fed charges on loans to banks and other financial 
institutions 
even bush administration officials while avoiding the use of 
the word recession agree the economy is weakening earlier 
this week treasury secretary nicholas f brady admitted it is 
experiencing a significant slowdown that is likely to persist 
through early 1991 
surveys of private economists and professional forecasters show 
that most believe the economy actually is contracting and will 
continue to deteriorate into next year 
they contend the economy was stumbling along the rim of a 
recession before the aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait and that the 
subsequent oilprice shock shoved it over the edge 
a recession generally is defined as two consecutive declines in 
the gnp the nations total output of goods and services and its 
broadest measure of economic health 
it grew at an anemic 17 percent annual rate during the first 
quarter but slowed to an a barely perceptible 04 percent rate in 
the second 
the department also reported that a gnp measure of inflation 
rose at an annual rate of 42 percent it had been revised to 42 
percent last month after the department initially said it had risen 
41 percent 
in its housing report the department said starts of new homes 
and apartments totaled a seasonally adjusted 113 million units 
following a 66 percent drop in october it was the first increase 
since a 232 percent gain last january 
contributing most to the downward revision in the gnp was a 
slower gain in consumer spending and a wider trade deficit than 
first estimated 
consumer spending rose just 27 percent rather than the 32 
percent reported last month the trade deficit was 19 billion 
compared to a 500 million gap in last months estimate 
the largest upward revision was in government spending up 12 
percent rather than 06 percent as reported last month 
business investment advanced 89 percent while housing fell 198 
percent during the quarter business inventories dropped 48 
billion 
the changes meant the total gnp was growing at an annual rate of 
417 trillion in the third quarter when adjusted for inflation 
that was a gain of 15 billion over the second quarter 
the gnp would need to increase 10 percent in the current 
quarter to meet the administrations 07 percent growth estimate 
for the year 
although most economist agree the economy has slipped into a 
recession they disagree over how negative economic growth will be 
and how long the downturn will last and most hedge their 
predictions on the outcome of the persian gulf crisis 
surveys indicate most economists believe the recession began in 
the current quarter and will end by april 
a december survey of 30 professional forecasters by the federal 
reserve bank of philadelphia shows a consensus of the participants 
project the economy to decline at annual rates of about 13 percent 
in the current quarter and 09 percent in the first quarter of 1991 
before inching ahead again in the second 
the consensus forecast of 52 prominent economists surveyed by 
blue chip economic indicators this month finds an identical 
projection 
nevertheless individual forecasts vary widely with some 
analysts saying the economy is in worse shape than the consensus 
and others contending it is in better 
analysts at mitsubishi bank in new york for instance say 
economic growth is dropping at a 25 percent rate economists at 
merrill lynch capital markets in new york say the gnp is declining 
at a 3 percent rate this quarter fuji securities in chicago say 
the economy will decline by 30 percent to 40 percent from october 
through december 
the surveys consensus also shows the economy resuming growth in 
the second quarter but again this view is not unanimous 
the merrill lynch economists for instance say they believe a 
recovery can begin sometime in the second half of 1991 
economists at levy economic forecasts in chappaqua ny also 
forecast the recession itself will end in late 1991 but they 
contend the recession marks the beginning of a contained 
depression caused by overinvestment and that the resulting 
overbuilding and excess capacity will take years to absorb

southland corps emergence from bankruptcy court 
proceedings may be delayed by a second creditors vote on a 
prepackaged reorganization plan 
us bankruptcy judge harold abramson said tuesday he may order 
creditors to vote again on the plan the company filed in october 
when it sought protection from its creditors under chapter 11 of 
the federal bankruptcy laws 
southland the dallasbased owner of the 7eleven convenience 
store chain put the restructuring plan to a vote just before the 
bankruptcy filing bondholders who oppose the package claim 
southland did not allow sufficient time for a fair vote they also 
claim some ballots were miscounted 
i am prepared to hold that the vote doesnt comply with the 
law abramson said during the second day of testimony 
southland which had sales of almost 8 billion last year said 
it was overwhelmed by the debt left from its 49 billion leveraged 
buyout in 1987 
the company has been struggling under heavy interest payments 
brought on by the buyout which was announced before the oct 19 
1987 stock market crash but financed after it 
the bankruptcy filing listed 253 billion in assets and 338 
billion in liabilities 
southland first proposed a restructuring last march when it 
announced the sale of most of the company to itoyokado co ltd 
and seveneleven japan co ltd its japanese affiliates 
the buyers would provide 430 million in cash for stock in the 
reorganized company 
that amounts to 70 percent of the reorganized southland 
creditors would get 25 percent and the companys founders the 
thompson family of dallas would get 5 percent under the 
prepackaged plan 
in a prepackaged filing most creditors have approved a 
reorganization plan before a company enters bankruptcy if a judge 
approves the terms of the plan are then imposed on the dissenting 
creditors proponents say the speedier process assures a fairer 
deal for more creditors 
southland operates approximately 6900 7eleven stores and other 
convenience outlets in the united states and canada with another 
6000 stores in the united states and 21 other countries run by 
licensees of which seveneleven japan is the largest

the president of two troubled staterun television 
channels resigned wednesday journalists at one channel are on 
strike and popular programs on the other have been canceled for 
financial reasons 
philippe guilhaume president of antenne 2 and fr3 announced 
his decision at a news conference while strikers jeered he blamed 
unspecified political powers for creating obstacles that made 
his task impossible 
the resignation coincided with separate crises at each of the 
channels which together employ more than 4500 people 
at fr3 which specializes in cultural programs and regional 
news most of its 600 journalists have been on strike since nov 28 
seeking higher wages about 100 of the strikers staged a protest at 
luxury plazaathenee hotel as guilhaume arrived to hold his news 
conference 
at antenne 2 which competes with the privately owned tf1 for 
the largest share of french viewers executives recently cancelled 
or cut back a halfdozen popular programs for budgetary reasons 
the channel reportedly has amassed a deficit of more than 100 
million dollars for 1990 
antenne 2s problems were thrust into the national spotlight on 
monday night during the annual awards ceremony for the french 
television industry 
one of the winners was frederic mitterrand who has been host or 
producer of several antenne 2 programs including some that have 
been affected by the cutbacks

president francois mitterrand placed his trophy on the floor

channel which was privatized in 1987 
the socialist government had made clear that it was not prepared 
to defend guilhaume 
prior to the resignation communications minister catherine 
tasca had questioned how guilhaume could declare that all is 
going well at a company in which the majority of employees say 
there are problems 
guilhaume 48 was named head of the two channels in august 1989 
by the government advisory board which oversees the television 
industry

britains economy shrank 12 percent in the third 
quarter the biggest contraction in 10 years the government said 
wednesday 
the central statistical office said a cut in oil production was 
to blame for the drop in its average estimate of gross domestic 
product 
the treasurys top official meanwhile said the outlook was for 
a weak performance in the fourth quarter of 1990 and early 1991 
but chancellor of the exchequer norman lamont told a yearend 
briefing of foreign journalists that the current slowdown is a 
desirable byproduct of years of rapid expansion 
although companies and industries undoubtedly will suffer from a 
slowdown this is the price you pay to get inflation down he 
said 
lamont predicted the downturn would not last as long as 
britains 198081 recession

the federal reserves dramatic decision to cut 
a key interest rate effective today will reduce americans 
borrowing costs but wont avert a recession economists say 
the first drop in the feds discount rate in four years from 7 
percent to 65 percent will almost certainly prompt banks to 
reduce their lending rates analysts said the discount rate is the 
interest the fed charges member banks for loans 
despite a series of modest creditloosening steps by the fed 
starting in late october major banks under pressure to shore up 
their dwindling profits have steadfastly resisted passing on 
lower rates to borrowers 
the prime rate the interest that banks charge their best 
business customers has been stuck at 10 percent at all but a 
handful of smaller institutions a wide variety of other business 
and consumer loans are tied to it 
norwest bank of minneapolis was the first to respond to the 
feds action late tuesday it announced a cut in its prime rate to 
975 percent 
a drop in the discount rate is the most visible way the central 
bank can signal its determination to rescue the economy from a 
slump for months the bush administration had been pressuring the 
independent agency to do more to stave off recession 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater had applauded the feds 
latest move saying it should be helpful in promoting growth in 
the economy in the months ahead 
but today he sidestepped a question on whether banks should 
lower their prime lending rates in response to the fed action 
saying that was a market decision 
normally a discountrate cut reverberates throughout the 
system fitzwater said 
commerce secretary robert a mosbacher called it a very 
positive step that would set the base for economic recovery 
economists agreed but they added that looser credit is coming 
too late to avert a recession loosely defined as a contraction of 
the economy lasting at least six months they said recovery will 
not come until late next year at the earliest even if the fed 
cuts rates further as expected 
it will really almost be summertime before we feel the full 
impact of the changes said economist paul getman of regional 
financial associates in west chester pa unfortunately poor 
growth over the next six months is preordained 
many economists had not expected a decline in the discount rate 
until next month at the earliest they assumed the fed would wait 
to see whether a shooting war broke out in the persian gulf after 
the jan 15 united nations deadline for iraq to withdraw from 
kuwait 
analysts said three factors prompted the central bank to move 
sooner concern that the economic downturn is accelerating worry 
about the weakness of the banking system and the opportunity to 
move on a day when the bond market was rallying on good inflation 
news 
the fed obviously is now seeing an economy that is spiraling 
downward said economist david jones of aubrey g lanston amp co 
in new york virtually all of the numbers theyve been looking at 
have been extremely negative 
unemployment in november jumped to a threeyear high of 59 
percent one of the few bright spots in the economy has been trade 
but the commerce department reported tuesday that the deficit took 
an unexpected leap to 116 billion in october the worst monthly 
trade gap in 2 years 
until now aggressive easing by the fed had been prevented by a 
substantial minority of policymakers who feared that inflation 
already aggravated by skyrocketing oil prices caused by the persian 
gulf crisis would resurge 
however the labor department reported tuesday that consumer 
prices in november rose at a moderate 37 percent annual rate down 
from an 89 percent rate over the previous three months 
also analysts said the increasing fragility of the nations 
largest banks added to the concern of the federal reserve which 
was created in 1913 to protect the nations financial system 
on tuesday the largest us bank citicorp said it would lay 
off 8000 employees slash its dividend to shareholders and set 
aside 350 million to cover bad loans

the european community on wednesday 
fined three chemical concerns a total 662 million for running a 
cartel in the western european market for soda ash 
the action includes the largest ec antitrust fine ever imposed 
414 million against solvay belgiums largest chemical company 
solvay called the fine utterly unreasonable and said it would 
appeal 
the ec commission also fined britains imperial chemical 
industries plc 235 million and chemische fabrik kalk gmbh a unit 
of basf ag of germany 138 million 
the commission said the companies had an agreement by which ici 
would not sell soda ash on the continent if solvay and chemische 
fabrik kalk stayed out of britain 
the commission said solvay and ici had fixed the market so that 
companies looking for secondary sources of soda ash ended up buying 
from the cartel anyway 
soda ash is used in the chemical industry as a neutralizing 
agent it also accounts for up to 60 percent of the raw material 
costs of glass making 
it is so widely used the commission said the cartels effect 
is ultimately felt by millions of consumers 
the fine is the second blow to solvay in the three months in 
october the ec withdrew all antidumping duties on soda ash 
imports from the american natural soda ash corp 
analysts say the end of the duties may hit solvays earnings 
severely soda ash and its derivatives represent 10 percent of 
solvays total sales

credit boeing for the soft landing 
recessions usually hit this area harder than elsewhere but this 
time economists say the good fortune of the boeing co should 
cushion seattle and much of washington state from the economic 
downturn of the rest of the country 
in a state where a superheated economy produced an average 
annual job growth of 5 percent since 1985 economists are 
forecasting that things might return to normal 
economically the late 1980s were kind to seattle real estate 
values soared in a city considered by many to be among the most 
livable jobs were so plentiful that fastfood joints offered 725 
an hour for flipping burgers developers rebuilt the citys skyline 
with more than a dozen major buildings 
much of that prosperity can be attributed to boeing which has 
104700 workers in washington and accounts for one out of every six 
jobs directly or indirectly in the state 
by late december boeing had received 466 billion in new 
commercial jet business for 1990 approaching a sixth record year 
of orders planes ordered three or four years ago are rolling off 
assembly lines at a rate of better than one a day 
in november however state officials acknowledged that the 
recession gripping much of the country had spread mildly to 
washington state economist chang mook sohn forecasts a net loss of 
10000 nonfarm jobs statewide in the first half of 1991 about 5 
percent of the 21 million member workforce 
in seattle a real estate market that had seen home prices climb 
60 percent to 70 percent from 1987 to 1989 returned to normal as 
too many homes were put up for sale for prices too few buyers could 
afford 
construction also declined with some commercial developers 
delaying projects and complaining about an overbuilt downtown weak 
manufacturing and construction in turn have hurt services the 
retailwholesale trade and finance sectors sohn said 
what happened again sohn and other economists look to boeing 
from 1983 to 1989 boeings employment in this area exploded 
from 58000 to 106000 37 percent of all jobs created in 
washington during that period were with the planemaker 
it was the main force behind the rapid immigration to the 
state and the main force behind the housing boom that resulted 
said douglas pedersen vice president and chief economist for 
security pacific bank of washington 
boeings employment peaked in 1989 as commercial production 
became more efficient and defense cuts threatened government 
projects while the growth in aerospace jobs appears over for now 
sohn says boeings employment isnt likely to fall much further 
one of the big differences between the current downturn and 
previous recessions sohn said is the role of the aerospace 
industry in the past a slowdown in planemaking was an advance 
symptom of a recession and tended to pull down washingtons 
economy 
aerospace works this time is a buffer rather than a 
destabilizing force he said 
the recession of the early 80s was magnified here by boeing 
laying off 22000 employees as orders and deliveries of aircraft 
fell 
in 1982 106 aircraft were ordered and 176 were delivered as 
1990 drew to a close boeings orders already had reached 517 
airplanes and it had delivered at least 364 
it has a firm backlog of at least 1850 planes and hundreds more 
options for purchases and is booking delivery dates past the turn 
of the century 
the region isnt without its worries though the timber 
industry for example is hurting from a slump in homebuilding and 
higher log prices 
the home construction slowdown also has hit here but again not 
as hard as elsewhere 
statewide housing starts for 1990 total 43600 about 38 
percent fewer than 1989 pedersen says commercial construction 
also is lagging 
theres very little new building under way and little 
likelihood of more building in the next few years said jon 
runstad president and chief executive officer of wright runstad a 
major seattle developer

grain and soybean futures prices closed lower 
wednesday on the chicago board of trade as export trade continued 
to lag behind expectations 
helping to push prices lower was news that us and soviet 
officials tuesday failed to agree on terms of the 500 million to 
1 billion export credit offer made by the united states the 
soviet union wants the credit offer to include the cost of shipping 
farm products to the ussr a condition the united states is 
relunctant to agree to 
analysts said if the cost of shipping is included it would 
leave the soviets with less money to purchase grain 
soybean futures were heavily pressured by word of a major 
purchase of south american soybean meal by the soviet union 
so much attention is being paid the lack of business from the 
soviet union that people are ignoring the fact sales to our 
traditional customers taiwan south korean and japan are 
down said analyst joel karlin of research department inc in 
chicago adding that those countries are buying from china which 
had a record crop 
they dont feel the pressure to buy us grains as they have 
felt in the past karlin said 
at the close wheat was cent to 4 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in december at 247 a bushel corn was 1 
cent to 3 cents lower with december at 224 a bushel oats were 1 
cent to 1 cents lower with december at 105 a bushel soybeans 
were 4 cents to 7 cents lower with january at 576 a bushel

a 150yearold former woolen mill in this 
sleepy massachusetts town seems an unlikely home for the worlds 
secondlargest computer company 
but then digital equipment corp is not your typical 
13billionayear corporation 
unlike many major companies digital has never felt the need for 
a flashy headquarters it also has never laid off an employee even 
at the depths of a computer industry slump in the early 1980s 
now that corporate benevolence is being tested as digital girds 
itself for the double whammy of a computer industry downturn and a 
recession 
the hard times already have hit home at the mill as 
employees call the redbrick complex 30 miles west of boston that 
once turned out army blankets 
earlier this year digital reported its firstever loss a 256 
million deficit for the quarter ended june 30 for the fiscal year 
ended that day digitals profit dropped to 744 million from 
107 billion a year earlier to blame was a 550 million charge 
against earnings digital took to pay for a plan that is aimed at 
reducing staff through voluntary severance offers 
digitals stock price also has suffered falling from an 
alltime high of 19950 in 1987 to the range of 57 a share 
the company announced several waves of cutbacks including plant 
closings and the elimination of 9000 employees through the end of 
next june by voluntary means 
some industry analysts predict even more staff cuts including 
layoffs john logan of the boston hightech research firm aberdeen 
group believes digital will fire at least 10000 of its 123000 
employees in early 1991 other analysts peg the number at 20000 
analysts blame digitals problems chiefly on a bloated payroll 
logan said workers at a phoenix assembly plant were put to work 
painting the walls after demand for the products they made dried 
up digital recently said it would close the plant 
they can lay off 15 percent of their organization and still 
not cut into the meat logan said 
he said digital has the lowest revenue per employee of any 
computer maker about 104000 during last fiscal year compared 
with 164000 at international business machines corp in 1989 
but layoffs would not come without a price particularly to 
kenneth olsen digitals 64yearold cofounder and president 
its a personal tragedy of ken olsen to have layoffs logan 
said he added that worker morale has been hurt as employees wait 
for the expected pink slips 
not that digitals predicament is unique many other computer 
companies have been eliminating workers as demand slowed troubled 
unisys corp has endured several rounds of layoffs and industry 
leader ibm has been scaling back through voluntary means 
like other computer makers along massachusetts route 128 
technology belt digital has been hurt by the slowdown in sales of 
minicomputers machines designed for more than one user that are 
smaller than closetsize mainframes but larger than desktop models 
as personal computers and the slightly larger models called 
workstations have grown more powerful they have chipped away the 
market for minicomputers digitals traditional strength 
but olsen blames his companys problems on the economy not a 
minicomputer slump 
for the last few years people have not in this country been 
investing in the future he said recently in his modest office 
where vacuum tubes and computer parts line the exposed brick walls 
digital was geared up for a certain level of sales he said 
when these revenues failed to materialize profits sagged as excess 
overhead took its toll 
we have a religious belief that as we make more computation 
available for less money the demand will grow even faster so in 
the last few years more than ever in the past we have been 
increasing the computing capacity we offer and at lower price 
the formula failed as the economy slowed but we believe its 
a shortterm thing he said 
digital also was hurt as customers waited for promised new 
models before placing orders among the newer machines are 
digitals first mainframe computers which the company announced in 
october 1989 in a bid to compete more directly with ibm 
however shipment of these vax 9000 models was delayed several 
times in the most recent acknowledgement of problems digital said 
last week it would swap some of the circuits in the 100 or so 
mainframes it has delivered to prevent a problem that caused some 
of the machines to crash 
digitals cutbacks profit declines and problems with the 
mainframes dont take away from the fact that the company has been 
a singular american success story industry watchers say 
analyst peter schay of the research firm gartner group inc in 
stamford conn calls digital arguably the most successful 
startup of the postwar period in any industry 
olsen was a young massachusetts institute of technology graduate 
when he cofounded the company in 1957 with the help of venture 
capital 
digitals first breakthrough product was the pdp1 which in 
effect was the first personal computer introduced in 1960 the 
pdp1 used a video screen and a keyboard to enter information 
directly into the computer a major advance in an era when 
programs were entered using punch cards and users sometimes had to 
wait hours or days until a program was processed 
digital continually upgraded the pdp line but its next 
breakthrough was the vax line introduced in 1977 all vax models 
can be hooked together easily and use the same software in 
contrast to ibms computer lines 
in a longrunning ad campaign digital has pounded home the 
message that digital has it now playing off ibms unfulfilled 
promise of being able to link all its machines seamlessly in a 
network 
the vax line has been enormously popular helping digitals 
profit grow nearly fourfold from 1984 to 1988 while revenues 
doubled 
the companys good fortune began to wane after the october 1987 
stock market crash as the slowing economy hit all computer makers 
about the same time the minicomputer slump set in some customers 
began to perceive digitals product line as tired and competitors 
introduced machines that provided stronger competition analysts 
say 
also digital was hurt by the growing interest among customers 
for open computer systems in which machines from any maker 
can be connected and use the same software analysts say 
in 1988 digital announced products that provide these features 
by masking the differences between computer brands it since has 
become a leader in computer integration or making different 
brands work together 
digital announced in october it plans to make its vax line 
compatible with software written for the unix operating system 
which is becoming an industry standard an operating system is the 
base layer of software that controls a computers internal 
functions 
in the past two years digital has taken other steps to address 
the opensystems movement it introduced a workstation line that 
uses the unix operating system rather than the vax one it also 
began offering ibmcompatible personal computers made for it by 
tandy corp addressing its lack of homegrown personal computers 
and in october digital announced new small computers that also 
use intel corp microprocessors which are the brains of ibm 
and ibmcompatible personal computers these machines which 
digital makes itself are aimed at small and mediumsized 
businesses 
dec today is a very different company than it was 2 years ago 
from a product point of view schay said 
he also said digitals profit slump shouldnt overshadow the 
fact that the company is financially strong with low debt and a 
large cash reserve 
olsen emphasized the same point 
our profit is down but were not troubled in the traditional 
sense he said 
weve gone through many recessions he added well do 
better when our customers are successful

like henry ford at ford motor co and 
thomas watson at ibm ken olsen is the guiding light at digital 
equipment corp 
that raises the question of how the computer giant will fare 
once the 64yearold cofounder and president moves on 
though olsen says he has no plans to retire anytime soon and 
the company has no mandatory retirement age digital eventually 
will have to deal with life without the man who has run it for 33 
years 
but digitalwatchers dont appear too concerned 
i really dont believe its a oneman company said wes 
melling an analyst at the hightech research firm gartner group 
inc who once worked for digital 
theres no question he is a very strong personality and that 
the culture he has built into the company strongly reflects his 
values and management style but i think it is the kind of culture 
that can exist independent of the man messing said 
digital is kind of a japanese company in the sense that many 
of the key decisions are made as consensus decisions he added 
he picks things he thinks are critical for the company and he 
really focuses on those things that also says that there are 200 
other projects out there that the managers get to manage 
industry analysts take olsen at his word that he has no plans to 
retire soon that appears to ease concern about the lack of a 
designated heirapparent 
he is a founder he has said many times he wants to continue 
in an active role so im not going to forecast what might 
happen said jay stevens who follows digital for dean witter 
reynolds inc 
john logan an analyst at the computer research firm aberdeen 
group said digital has a group of vice presidents in their 40s 
that olsen has been grooming for 20 years as possible 
successors 
olsen has been giving more daytoday responsibility for running 
digital to john smith the senior vice president for operations 
but olsen denies that has any bearing on a decision to retire 
i always say ill leave graciously but maybe theyll have to 
kick me out but it wont be for a while he said in a recent 
interview

usx corp and the united steelworkers union 
said wednesday they will resume talks jan 7 on a new labor 
contract for 18000 workers 
if were going to keep making steel we have to make a deal 
said chief union negotiator andrew lefty palm 
the current fouryear contract expires feb 1 talks aimed at an 
early agreement were recessed nov 10 after the sides failed to 
reach a contract by that date 
weve kept the door open for the resumption of the process 
and the groundwork has been laid for us to negotiate an agreement 
that meets the needs of our members palm said 
usx the nations largest steel maker said it was optimistic an 
agreement will be reached by jan 31 palm said its hard to 
say whether negotiators will meet the deadline 
usx plays everything right to the end he said 
the union wants usx to fall in line with other steel makers who 
restored pay cuts that workers absorbed during the industrys 
decline in the early 1980s 
palm said the companys last proposal would have restored wages 
to the 1982 level but not provided increases beyond that the union 
is seeking an additional 150 an hour he said 
companies that have agreed to reinstate pay concessions include 
bethlehem steel corp national steel corp armco inc and 
financially ailing wheelingpittsburgh steel corp and ltv steel 
co 
usx chairman charles a corry has said the company will ignore 
the agreements with other steel makers 
the union has also said the companys proposal failed to address 
costofliving increases and the possibility of a corporate 
restructuring usx plans to make its steel division a wholly owned 
subsidiary 
the current contract was reached after a sixmonth work stoppage 
in 1986 
usx makes steel in pennsylvania illinois indiana and alabama 
it also mines iron ore and operates several joint ventures 
including a partnership with japans kobe steel in lorain ohio

the international arm of the national 
broadcasting co said wednesday it has formed a joint venture with 
two japanese companies that will distribute nbc programs in the far 
east and produce shows in japan 
nbc said the deal will improve its ability to distribute 
nbcproduced programs in asia and to explore potential media 
investments in japan 
but even in announcing the venture nbc executives said the new 
company was being unfairly constrained by federal regulations that 
limit what the three major us television networks can do in 
program production and distribution 
nbc and the companies that own the other two networks cbs inc 
and capital citiesabc inc have asked the federal communications 
commission to lift or modify the financial interest and syndication 
rules 
the hollywood studios generally oppose modification of the 
rules saying the networks are gatekeepers of the broadcast 
airwaves and would have too much power over what is shown on 
television without them 
nbc international said its partners in the new venture called 
nnbc are mitsui amp co ltd a japanese trading company and tv 
tokyo channel 12 a japanese tv network 
terms of the venture agreement including how much each partner 
was investing and what their relative equity stake in the new 
company is were not disclosed 
the new company will distribute nbcproduced entertainment and 
sports programming in japan and other countries in the far east 
according to jb holston iii senior vice president and general 
manager of nbc international 
this could include shows such as the dramatic series shannons 
deal or the miniseries luckychances 
richard cotton general counsel at nbc said nbc would like to 
be able to distribute programs other than those it produces itself 
but cannot do so because of the federal regulations 
the new venture would also produce a variety of programs in 
japan that could then be sold to tv networks or stations abroad 
holston said 
cotton said federal regulations would prohibit nbc from 
importing any of these coproduced programs for use on its us 
television network however 
todays agreement represents a significant international 
business opportunity for nbci and we look forward to the day when 
we can increase our international activities holston said 
nbc international has a number of similar distribution 
agreements in other countries cotton said nbc spokesman richard 
cutting said the only similar coproduction agreement involving nbc 
is tango productions in great britain where its partner is the 
independent television company yorkshire tv 
earlier this week nbc news said it had entered into a joint 
newsgathering venture with nippon television network of japan 
another japanese broadcast network that deal is separate from the 
nnbc joint venture

philips president jan d timmer 
suggested wednesday that the dutch electronics giant might be 
broken up and sold in pieces if his drastic reorganization plan 
fails 
splitting the company up is the very last resort a step that 
neither i nor philips are ready to take timmer said in an 
interview published in a company news journal distributed to the 
staff 
timmer did not elaborate on what he meant but the remarks 
appeared timed to clear the air of rampant speculation that the 
285000employee philips empire was in danger of crumbing 
this past summer timmer decreed an extraordinary costcutting 
drive at philips aimed at trimming fat from the company and making 
it more competitive with aggressive japanese rivals 
part of the cutback involves eliminating 55000 jobs among 
philips worldwide operations which manufacture consumer 
electronic items ranging from light bulbs to televisions 
i do not deny that the restructuring operation will involve 
the ending and divestment of activities but it is certainly not 
the intention to let the company fall apart timmer said 
our first responsibility is to restore philips to full 
health timmer said we are assuming that if everyone does 
their bit improvements can be made throughout philips that will 
allow us to maintain the company in its present form 
timmer said we are already seeing the first signs of 
improvement for philips which is expecting a 24 billion loss 
this year 
without these measures the company would have got into 
tremendous difficulties timmer said if you accept the 
presidency then you cannot evade the responsibility to take a 
hard uncompromising line in turning the company around if that is 
what is needed 
tom gietman an amsterdambased analyst with the van meerjames 
capel brokerage firm speculated that the statements were aimed 
partly at philips dutch labor unions which are negotiating to 
minimize the impact of the job losses 
it is just a warning to the negotiators to take a better 
position gietman said 
fokko tuin head of research at kempen and co said that timmer 
is indicating that as long as possible everything will be 
kept together as it is but in the end a breakup remains a 
possibility

the national transportation safety board on 
wednesday urged the auto industry to redesign seat belts so they 
can easily be used by children short adults and the elderly 
in a letter to 33 american and foreign auto companies the board 
said the change would increase seatbelt use and promote safety it 
hopes to persuade automakers to install an adjustable upper anchor 
for the shoulder strap portion of the seat belt in all new cars 
european automakers generally offer adjustable upper anchors 
but the system isnt generally available in the united states the 
board said earlier this year the boardincluded the proposed 
change on a most wanted list of safety recommendations 
the board said in its letter that serious accident injuries may 
result from improper seatbelt use because of an inability to 
adjust them to the size of the occupant 
improper use can degrade the belts ability to prevent serious 
injury and given certain accident circumstances may introduce the 
possibility of serious beltinduced injuries the letter said 
thomas carr director of safety for the motor vehicle 
manufacturers association in detroit said the group and its 
member auto companies would discuss and consider the 
recommendation 
carr agreed that if seat belts are more comfortable there are 
less objections to using them 
the only issue is to what extent people might misadjust belts 
not putting them in the best position because its a lot more 
comfortable he said contending that seat belts now are 
positioned to the advantage of the vast majority of the 
population 
a 1988 ntsb report noted that the most common mistake in 
seatbelt use especially in seating children was to place the 
shoulder portion of the belt behind a childs back parents 
commonly do that because they cant adjust that part of the belt 
and dont want it to come in contact with a childs face or neck 
short adults also share the fear of neck injury from an 
illfitting shoulder harness and also may be tempted to misroute 
the belt the board said another form of misuse noted was the 
placing of the shoulder portion of the belt under the arm a 
routing that can have fatal consequences 
the board said that while the national highway traffic safety 
administration declined to require a redesign to make shoulder 
harnesses adjustable it encourages manufacturers to do so 
voluntarily 
ford the board said plans to introduce the device in some 
fourdoor models next spring and will phase it in forher car light 
truck and van models over the next two to three years 
general motors provides the adjustable anchor only on the 
fourdoor oldsmobile 98 and the fourdoor buick park avenue it 
said 
the board said that because of mandatory seatbelt laws in 36 
states seatbelt use increased from 14 percent in 1984 to 50 
percent this year 
in a 1988 study of serious accidents 80 percent of 214 
frontseat occupants wearing properly adjusted seat belts sustained 
only minor or moderate injuries or no injuries at all the board 
said

after settling a shareholder suit 
with texas billionaire robert m bass and others the times 
publishing co has emerged with 81 million cash and a healthy 
balance sheet newly disclosed documents show 
the settlement reached last august specified that neither side 
would reveal any details but times publishing released some 
information tuesday to satisfy requests from the state of florida 
the disclosure gave several details about the privately held 
company that publishes the st petersburg times but the amount the 
company paid bass to drop his suit was not reported 
under the terms of the settlement times publishing agreed to 
buy back a 40 percent stake owned by the bass group the group had 
purchased the stake in august 1988 for about 28 million and had 
offered to buy the rest of the company for 270 million earlier 
this year 
the documents released tuesday show total bank debt for the 
newspaper company as of nov 30 was 9 million 
the company is strong and vital and we can go on to other 
things chief executive and editor andrew barnes said 
according to company treasurer catherine heron the companys 
cash position would cover the majority of existing bank debt 
the 9 million debt will be paid off by 1995 she said 
the documents were released to the florida attorney general bob 
butterworths office which was concerned that the shareholder 
settlement could adversely affect the poynter institute for media 
studies in st petersburg 
the institute is the chief shareholder of times publishing 
after acquiring its stake the bass partnership had sued times 
publishing over dividend payments the bulk of which support the 
institutes educational programs 
under the settlement times publishing agreed to buy back the 
bass stake and redeem an issue of nonvoting stock which paid 
healthy dividends to the institute 
at the time of the settlement the company claimed the agreement 
would not hurt the institute it said the preferred shares held by 
the institute would be replaced by debt which would pay more in 
annual interest than the preferred stock once paid in dividends 
the company said the institute also could expect to receive 
dividends from the common stock it holds 
the latest disclosures show the institute eventually will own 
all of the times publishing common stock 
robert lanzillotti dean emeritus of the university of floridas 
graduate business school was hired by the institute to 
independently review the bass settlement 
he said it will make possible substantially greater financial 
support for the institutes operations and growth over the long 
run 
in addition to the st petersburg newspaper one of the largest 
and most prominent in the south times publishing runs 
congressional quarterly florida trend and georgia trend magazines

chinas first computerized stock market opened 
wednesday in shanghai with almost no stocks for sale 
instead government bonds are the main offering and even their 
sale will be tightly restricted 
the new shanghai securities exchange which opened with great 
fanfare falls far short of what economic reformers envisioned 
several years ago when they proposed setting up a nationwide tock 
market 
the exchange listed only seven stocks on opening day reflecting 
the governments fear of allowing financial speculation 
authorities also are unenthusiastic about stocks because they 
transfer ownership of companies from state hands to the private 
sector 
the market concluded 93 transactions involving a total of 1029 
million yuan worth about 198 million on its first day the 
official news agency xinhua said 
it said more than 500 people attended an opening ceremony 
presided over by shanghai mayor zhu rongji widely regarded as an 
economic reformer 
chinese with cash to invest have demonstrated a keen interest in 
buying securities especially stocks but the government has not 
made it easy for them 
until shanghais market opened they had to keep track of 
differing prices at unlinked trading counters at various shanghai 
banks most counters were open only a few days a week 
there was a burst of excitement monday night after the 
shanghaibased shenghua electronics corp announced plans to sell 
120000 shares of stock thousands of people lined up overnight at 
the scattered trading counters to get application forms to buy 
if you want to be a stockholder you must suffer through the 
cold one man told the shanghai evening news newspaper 
with the opening of the unified market investors will have 
onestop shopping but they will be able to buy and sell only 
through the exchanges 22 member brokerages 
gong haocheng governor of the shanghai branch of chinas 
central bank said buyers are limited to 10 shares apiece of each 
stock issue in order to control speculation bonds are traded only 
for the years 198689 
gong said authorities have not decided whether to let 
foreignfunded enterprises sell shares 
the shanghai securities exchange originally was planned as a 
nationwide market and has established ties with more that 60 
security trading counters around the country 
however it will be competing with the computerized securities 
automated quotations system that opened in beijing two weeks ago 
and also will trade securities on a national basis the two systems 
were to have worked closely but apparently are now under the 
guidance of rival government authorities 
in addition the southeastern special economic zone of shenzhen 
already has a primitive stock market with six listed companies 
shenzhen and nearby the zhuhai special zone both plan to develop 
computerized markets next year 
the government allowed the first stock issue under communist 
rule in 1985 thousands of companies have issued stocks but 
generally only to employees few are actively traded

the dollar finished higher in domestic trading 
wednesday after putting in a mixed performance overseas 
gold prices advanced in foreign dealings and then surged when 
trading shifted to the united states on the new york commodity 
exchange gold bullion for current delivery jumped 950 a troy 
ounce to settle at 386 later republic national bank quoted a 
late bid for gold of 38390 up 815 an ounce from tuesdays late 
bid 
the advance in precious metals prices was attributed to 
followthrough buying following the federal reserves move late 
tuesday to trim a key lending rate the fed said it will lower the 
discount rate the interest charged on loans to member banks to 
65 percent from 7 percent 
lower interest rates tend to boost gold prices because they make 
it easier for investors to borrow to buy the metal but lower rates 
usually are harmful for the dollar as they erode the value of 
fixedincome securities 
still analysts said the dollar remained particularly resilient 
in us dealings despite the lower interest rates concerns 
about the persian gulf are discouraging dollarbears from 
selling said marc chandler an analyst at idea 
the dollar also drew support from rumors that the bank of japan 
was preparing to follow the feds lead and lower interest rates 
lower japanese rates would be helpful to the dollar as well as us 
bonds by widening the rate differential between japan and the 
united states 
the yen was very weak chandler said noting that investors 
bought the european currencies and sold off their yen 
activity was very quiet and traders predict the coming week 
will continue to be slow unless tensions escalate in the middle 
east said earl johnson a vice president at harris trust and 
savings bank in chicago 
in tokyo the dollar rose 024 yen to close at 13327 yen later 
in london it was quoted at a higher rate of 13405 yen in new 
york the dollar settled at 13405 yen up from 13272 yen on 
tuesday 
in london the british pound slid to 19316 from 19350 late 
tuesday in new york it cost 19310 to buy one pound cheaper than 
tuesdays 19430 
other late dollar rates in new york compared with late 
tuesdays rates included 14783 german marks up from 14780

weather not war fears had the biggest impact 
on a generally sluggish oil market wednesday with unseasonable 
warmth in the northeast depressing natural gas even as a chilly 
forecast lifted heating oil 
amid lackluster trading on the new york mercantile exchange 
light sweet crude oil settled at 2693 per barrel up one penny 
on contracts for delivery in february 
i would call that ominous stability said philip l dodge 
an analyst with nomura securities international inc it suggests 
somethings going to happen that nobodys anticiating 
brokers have said the market will likely stay quiet through the 
holidays barring major developments in the persian gulf 
although many oil traders have decided recently that war in the 
desert seems more likely than peace they have not gone on a buying 
spree oil supplies are adequate and there is a lingering 
perception that lastminute diplomacy could defuse the standoff 
sending prices plunging 
prices for crude oil have therefore shown no inclination to move 
out of the mid 20perbarrel range in recent sessions 
on fundamentals it would probably go to 20 a barrel or 
below said stephen smith an analyst with bear stearns amp co 
if there was war it would probably go to 40 its sitting 
halfway in between not knowing where to turn 
without any rumblings of war or peace stirring up the market 
the weather seemed to be taking control on some futures contracts 
home heating oil showed the greatest strength wednesday rising 
217 cents to 7784 cents a gallon on contracts for delivery in 
january 
theres been a forecast of arctic temperatures heading our 
way said thomas p blakeslee an energy analyst at pegasus 
econometric group inc in hoboken nj it kept prices up 
thus far the fall has been unseasonably warm keeping demand 
down for heating oil and natural gas 
natural gas contracts have plummeted in recent weeks as a 
result and the cold weather hitting much of the nation this week 
was not enough to lift them 
on wednesday natural gas for february delivery fell 64 cents 
to 1897 per 1000 cubic feet 
inventory for natural gas is simply brimming smith said 
unleaded gasoline showed little change rising 70 cent to 6742 
cents a gallon on contracts for january delivery

what would a mcdonalds corp restaurant 
call an experimental submarine sandwich obviously its the mcsub 
the fastfood giant which recently beefed up its menu with 
pizzas and specialty sandwiches has given five outlets in this 
college town permission to try their luck with the mcsubs 
the test reflects a desire by restaurants near the university of 
wisconsin to find a product tailored to students and is not being 
promoted by the corporation said carol koepke mcdonalds regional 
marketing manager in milwaukee 
they were looking for a convenient portable sandwich for 
football games and other activities ms koepke said 
many of the mcdonalds staples came about in response to 
customer needs she said for instance the big mac was first sold 
in industrial areas of philadelphia where workers wanted a bigger 
sandwich she said 
the new sub was developed in conjunction with oscar mayer co 
which has its headquarters in madison and supplies the meats in the 
sandwich ms koepke said 
its a small test operation but it holds the possibility for 
some more business oscar mayer spokesman jim aehl said 
the five flavors of a mcsub vegetarian italian ham and 
cheese turkey and turkey combo range in price from 199 to 
259 the come in an eightinch bun and with the standard 
submarine fixings of tomatoes lettuce onions and special sauces 
it is a very popular item ms koepke said but it is too 
early to tell whether we will roll it out nationally we tested the 
chicken mcnuggets for 10 years before we took it national

the decision by the federal reserve to reduce its discount rate 
helped boost the price of gold and silver wednesday on new yorks 
commodity exchange 
on other markets grain and soybeans were sharply lower 
livestock and pork futures were mixed and energy futures gained 
tuesdays cut in the discount rate means the federal government 
is trying to stimulate the economy said peter cardillo director 
of commodities research at jesup josephthal amp co inc 
the lowering of the discount rate particularly helped silver and 
platinum futures which had been in a free fall due to concerns 
about the economy 
silver and platinum depend solely on economic conditions 
cardillo said if the economy can be lifted then obviously both 
metals will do better because of lower interest rates 
gold traded higher on renewed fears of war in the persian gulf 
those fears were rekindled by iraqi rhetoric following the european 
communitys refusal to meat with iraqs foreign minister tariq 
aziz 
also contributing to tensions were reports iraq is adding to its 
forces in kuwait as well as a planned meeting between saudi 
arabian officials and us defense secretary richard cheney and 
gen colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
gold settled 950 to 1010 higher with the contract for 
delivery in february at 38800 a troy ounce silver was 132 cents 
to 141 cents higher with december at 4095 a troy ounce platinum 
was 50 to 770 higher with december at 41640 a troy ounce 
grain and soybean futures were lower on the chicago board of 
trade as export trade continued to lag behind expectations 
helping to push prices lower was news that us and soviet 
officials tuesday failed to agree on terms of the 500 million to 
1 billion export credit offer made by the united states the 
soviet union reportedly wants the credit offer to include the cost 
of shipping farm products to the ussr a condition the united 
states is reluctant to agree to 
analysts said if the cost of shipping is included it would 
leave the soviets with less money to purchase grain 
soybean futures were heavily pressured by word of a major 
purchase of south american soybean meal by the soviet union 
so much attention is being paid the lack of business from the 
soviet union that people are ignoring the fact sales to our 
traditional customers taiwan south korean and japan are 
down said analyst joel karlin of research department inc in 
chicago adding that those countries are buying from china which 
had a record crop 
they dont feel the pressure to buy us grains as they have 
felt in the past karlin said 
wheat was cent to 4 cents lower with december at 247 a 
bushel corn was 1 cent to 3 cents lower with december at 224 a 
bushel oats were 1 cent to 1 cents lower with december at 105 
a bushel soybeans were 5 cents to 7 cents lower with january at 
576 a bushel 
energy futures moved higher in quiet trading on the new york 
mercantile exchange 
robert baker an analyst with prudentialbache securities inc 
said the markets strength came from a stronger feeling that war 
eventually will erupt in the middle east 
light sweet crude was 1 cent to 34 cents higher with february at 
2693 a barrel heating oil was 70 cent to 217 cents higher with 
january at 7784 a gallon unleaded gasoline was 41 cent to 70 
cent higher with january at 6742 cents a gallon natural gas was 
064 cent lower to 010 cent higher with january at 2046 per 
1000 cubic feet 
livestock futures were lower and pork futures higher on the 
chicago mercantile exchange with cattle prices pressured by lower 
cash prices and reduced retail beef demand 
frozen pork bellies were up the 2cent limit as traders took 
advantage of the slide in prices in recent trading sessions to 
pocket profits 
live cattle were 12 cent to 45 cent lower with december at 
8050 cents a pound feeder cattle were 25 cent to 50 cent lower 
with january at 8875 cents a pound live hogs were 15 cent to 50 
cent lower with february at 4960 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were 188 cents to 2 cents lower with february at 6410

the sagging economy and retailers tales 
of woe havent kept holiday giftgivers from packing up cardboard 
boxes and sending them to loved ones across the country or to us 
troops in saudi arabia 
united parcel service the us postal service and federal 
express corp all say their volume has kept up with expectations 
although final numbers wont be known until after christmas 
at ups where 307 million packages were expected to be sent 
between thanksgiving and christmas there are no signs that the 
sending of gifts has slacked off this season said alan caminiti a 
spokesman for the greenwich connbased company 
the company projected business would peak this week at 22 
million packages a day twice the normal volume 
were pretty much right on target caminiti said customer 
counters have lines around the buildings 
customers are alo standing in lines at post offices across the 
country to send packages nationwide and to troops participating in 
operation desert shield said mark r saunders a postal service 
spokesman in washington 
in the weeks through dec 31 the postal service expects to 
deliver 4 billion cards letters and packages saunders said about 
1 percent of that total or 40 million will be parcels 
he said volume is holding steady with last year at this time 
when the postal service delivered as many as 5 million packages and 
200 million cards and letters in a single day dec 18 
federal express corp which normally delivers 13 million 
packages a day could see volume jump by as much as 17 percent a 
day in the week before christmas said armand schneider spokesman 
for the memphis tennbased company 
company officials made no hard projections about holiday 
shipping volume however because of the worsening economy 
we knew the economy was soft and we didnt know if it volume 
would increase at all schneider said 
ups predicted holiday business would be slightly above last 
years totals caminiti said so far its projections are holding 
true with the only surprise a sudden increase 1525 percent in 
the number of packages sent by air delivery 
a national ad campaign touting upss air service probably helped 
boost the service he said but there could be another factor 
the economy aside society is in a hurry caminiti said 
while the volume of holiday packages appears to be consistent 
with past years both saunders and caminiti said that cant be 
relied upon as an economic indicator 
theres no way to tell whether those boxes are filled with the 
same number of gifts or less expensive items than in years past 
saunders said 
you can send a gift for 100 and you can send a gift for 10 
and its still a piece of mail he said 
there has been one economic benefit to handle the extra volume 
ups has added 70000 temporary employees to its work force of 
240000 
federal express relied on its 94000 regular employees to handle 
the job while the postal service used a regular yearround 
temporary staff of 21000 that also works at other busy periods 
both federal express and ups said all their christmas packages 
would be delivered by christmas eve if bad weather prevents ups 
from delivering all packages by christmas eve ups will deliver 
them christmas morning caminiti said 
the postal service will also deliver packages christmas morning 
for customers who use its express mail overnight service saunders 
said and in some parts of the country postal carriers dressed as 
santa claus will hand over the gifts

continental airlines received a federal 
bankruptcy judges approval wednesday to sell its prized 
seattletokyo route to healthy rival american airlines for 150 
million 
the sale was one of a number of actions sanctioned by judge 
helen balick she is overseeing the reorganization of the airline 
that sought refuge from creditors dec 3 because of crushing debts 
and high fuel prices incited by the persian gulf crisis 
the houstonbased airline which like many companies is 
incorporated in delaware is among the weaker commercial carriers 
in an industry thats under enormous pressure from a slumping 
economy that has discouraged air travel 
continental had wanted to retain the seattletokyo route it is 
one of the most profitable because of burgeoning business between 
the west coast and asia 
but as the airlines financial problems grew more acute 
management decided the route was expendable and the cash provided 
from a sale could be put to better use 
continental officials said the proceeds from the sale which was 
first announced shortly after the airline sought bankruptcy 
protection would be used to buy new aircraft it has ordered 
for american the route provides a critical gateway to the 
pacific where the airline will compete directly with united 
airlines which now dominates usasian air travel 
the route sale still requires transportation department 
approval 
in other actions wednesday balick also approved some 
preliminary payments to contractors refurbishing continentals 
terminal at new yorks laguardia airport 
she agreed to hold a hearing dec 28 on the airlines request 
for permission to pay some tour operators and travel agents

shearson lehman brothers inc announced a plan 
wednesday to keep top stockbrokers at the firm by offering up to 
80000 in annual incentives that cant be cashed in for five 
years 
shearson follows merrill lynch amp co in revamping its 
compensation program during a period of slumping retail brokerage 
activity across wall street that has made stockbrokers more willing 
to take other jobs 
under the shearson program brokers and branch managers who have 
completed five years of consecutive service and meet production 
criteria will receive 4 percent of their gross production up to a 
maximum 80000 
after that employees in the program will be eligible for awards 
of 1 percent to 5 percent of gross production annually again up to 
a maximum 80000 a year to qualify brokers must increase their 
production by certain percentages over a previous threeyear 
average 
the brokers cannot receive the money before five years a move 
preventing those who qualify from leaving the firm and taking the 
bonus the cash however will earn interest also shearson said 
it can revoke an award under certain conditions depending on a 
brokers performance 
its golden handcuffs is what it amounts to said lawrence 
eckenfelder an analyst with prudentialbache securities inc in 
san francisco 
when things are slow is when you tend to lose more people 
he said when business is good brokers are always less inclined 
to leave 
for branch managers and brokers with the highest levels of 
production 25 percent of the incentive awards will consist of 
stock in american express co shearsons parent during the 
fiveyear waiting period employees will receive cash dividend 
payments on the stock 
last week merrill lynch said it would give a certificate to 
each of its 10500 brokers that could be worth up to 100000 if 
they remain at the firm for 10 years 
unlike merrill though shearson said it is not changing its 
method of commission payouts that comprise compensation for its 
9000 brokers merrill said newly hired inexperienced brokers 
would receive salaries in their first two years 
its incentive to stay and do quality business and to stay and 
be productive said joseph j plumeri president of shearsons 
private client group it was never on our mind to keep people 
from leaving 
shearson said in a statement it was forming a board that would 
review every award recommendation against a set of guidelines based 
on superior client service integrity quality ethics and 
teamwork the board will consist of senior managers including 
shearson lehman brothers president jonathan s linen 
analysts said the compensation incentives by merrill and 
shearson the nations top two brokerage firms marked a change 
typically wall street firms give annual bonuses to brokers based 
on production levels 
eckenfelder said the programs were cheaper than recruiting 
topflight brokers from other firms with large bonuses he also 
said that reducing attrition among top brokers could help improve 
the firms bottom line
