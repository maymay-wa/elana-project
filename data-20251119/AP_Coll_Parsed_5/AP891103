a usowned oil drilling ship with 97 
people aboard capsized early saturday after a typhoon swept through 
the gulf of thailand with 100 mph winds 
barry lane spokesman of the los angelesbased unocal oil 
company said six survivors had been rescued in heavy seas about 
270 miles south of bangkok but that they were thai fishermen not 
crew from the capsized seacrest drilling vessel 
no survivors of the seacrest had been found by late saturday 
morning lane said from los angeles he said a company helicopter 
that rushed to the site found the upsidedown hull of the 351foot 
ship still visible in the water 
the unocal helicopter dropped an inflatable liferaft to the 
group of six fishermen who were clinging to debris in the water but 
the copter was forced to return to another drilling platform to 
refuel lane said 
lane said the fishermen were picked up by the first boat that 
arrived at the site at 1040 am 1040 pm friday est he said 
the fishermen were clinging to their overturned fishing boat 
lane said rescue efforts were hampered by 6foot waves and 15 
mpg winds 
carol scott also a spokesman for unocal said in bangkok that 
the small overturned vessel with the fisherman latching on to it 
was first sighted at 815 am 815 pm est friday by a company 
helicopter 
lane said ships and aircraft had been searching for the 
seacrest a panamanianregistered vessel following a severe 
typhoon that lashed the area with 100mph winds and 35foot waves 
unocal officials said the crew included 67 thai nationals and 30 
workers from other countries lane said the seacrest is owned by a 
unocal subsidiary and operated by great eastern drilling and 
engineering co of singapore 
lane said of the 97 on board 77 are great eastern employees 
one is a unocal worker and 19 are from various other oilfield 
companies 
ms scott said a thai navy aircraft had earlier reported seeing 
a liferaft in the vicinity but it contained no survivors 
she said that at about 820 am a unocal helicopter spotted the 
stricken seacrest about 5 miles northwest of the platong oil 
processing platform 
the unocal subsidiary unocal thailand ltd has aircraft and 
ships searching the area and they were joined by units of the thai 
navy and air force 
lane said a drilling rig mounted in the center of the ship 
which reached 60 feet high was stacked with drilling equipment and 
there was concern the ship might have been too topheavy to weather 
such a fierce storm 
he said the seacrest had been operating in the platong natural 
gas field and the crew was preparing to run casing into a recently 
drilled gas well the vessel drills for both oil and gas 
officials said unocal lost contact with the vessel about 12 
hours after the storm struck thursday 
we have mobilized every available resource to aid in our 
search for the ship unocal chairman richard j stegemeier said 
earlier 
the typhoon developed suddenly and the crew of the seacrest had 
relatively short notice lane said 
this actually was a small storm a squall and it escalated 
very quickly into a tropical storm and then a typhoon 
stegemeier said other unocal facilities in the gulf suffered 
only minor damage and there were no reported injuries unocal had 
more than 1100 workers offshore on 46 platforms and 18 vessels at 
the time the storm struck 
unocal operates five natural gas fields in the gulf of thailand 
that normally produce about 540 million cubic feet of natural gas 
daily company officials said the seacrest first went into service 
in 1978

thousands of air travelers were delayed for 
hours at airports in washington and other areas friday when the 
regions main air traffic computer failed and its backup broke down 
about half an hour later 
airplanes en route to washington were held on the ground at 
airports from new york to north carolina to detroit when the 
breakdown occurred during a peak time of the airlines busiest days 
of the week federal aviation administration officials said 
there have been computer glitches but nothing of this 
magnitude faa spokesman hugh oneill said there were a lot of 
planes that were diverted around the system 
the main computer located at the washington air route traffic 
control center in leesburg supervises flights within a 
200000squaremile region oneill said the computers feed flight 
information to controllers radar screens 
nearly 30 minutes after the computer broke down the backup 
computer also failed but was later restored to intermittent 
operation oneill said both computers resumed operation at 650 
pm he said 
numerous flights scheduled to land at or depart from washington 
national washington dulles international baltimorewashington 
international airports were directed to bypass the washington area 
entirely 
the leesburg center one of about 20 in the country controls 
the region from new york to south carolina and between the atlantic 
ocean to the ohio river in 1986 the more than 300 controllers 
there directed 22 million flights 
the cause of the computer failures was not immediately known 
oneill said 
in 1987 a similar glitch launced an investigation across the 
entire faa system in that incident the 15yearold main computer 
an ibm 9020 broke down but a backup was working within 35 seconds 
faa officials said 
a new highspeed computer system was then dedicated at the 
leesburg center two years ago in a move officials said would reduce 
air travel delays and ease pressures on controllers 
the new ibm host computer was described as 10 times as fast and 
capable of handling four to five times as many airplanes as the one 
being replaced 
but despite the problems at the leesburg center a source at 
national airport told the washington post that flights operating on 
visual flight regulations were able to depart while those 
requiring instrument flight clearances were delayed

mayor xavier suarez is cruising toward election for 
a new fouryear term tuesday but hes keeping a worried eye on two 
hotly contested races that could leave the city commission without 
a black at a tense time for community relations 
campaigning has been dominated by heritage and skin color a 
recent pattern in miami 
the panorama is one in which if things dont go well for the 
black candidates we will end up without any black on the 
commission suarez said that is a concern for me it shouldnt 
lead to worse representation but with a fairly large black 
population its very symbolic 
the nonpartisan atlarge elections come as miamis black 
community stung when us district judge alcee hastings was 
convicted two weeks ago in senate impeachment proceedings is 
watching jury selection in the trial of miami police officer 
william lozano charged with manslaughter in a january shooting of 
a black that touched off race riots 
suarez elected in 1985 as miamis first cubanborn mayor was 
reelected in 1987 and a change in city law has made this election 
for a fouryear term his only opponent is former city commissioner 
armando lacasa also cubanborn 
lacasa 53 conceded when he announced his candidacy that he had 
little chance against suarez but said he was running to show 
suarez that not everyone is happy with him 
there are six candidates each for the two city commission races 
up for election this year unless a candidate wins more than 50 
percent tuesday the top two votegetters in each commission race 
will runoff one week later 
suarez 40 a harvardeducated lawyer won his first two mayoral 
elections in runoffs but his popularity has soared as he has 
emerged as a magnetic politician with the ability to appeal to all 
three of miamis main ethnic groups 
city voters are approximately 50 percent hispanic 30 percent 
black and 20 percent anglo 
an anglo and a cuban hold the two seats not up for election 
seeking reelection is miller dawkins the lone elected black on 
the commission while cubanborn rosario kennedy who resigned last 
summer for an unsuccessful run at congress leads a field seeking 
her old job 
suarez is backing dawkins and ms kennedy with a slogan of 
keep miamis magic one big neighborhood 
ironically suarezs sharpest critics are cuban dawkins are in 
the black community and dawkins chief foe joe carollos critics 
are fellow cubans 
lacasa charged suarez with a major blow to the exile 
community when he gave ms kennedys vacated seat on an interim 
basis to a black 
suarez called lacasas accusations ethnic politics of the 
worst kind 
carollo a 34yearold former police officer who served 
previously on the commission for eight years is known for fiery 
anticommunist crusading 
hes a concern he takes things very personally suarez 
said carollo would not be a good thing for the city 
some influential hispanics are backing dawkins 64 a community 
college administrator saying hes important for harmony 
we the cubans when we arrived fought for representation 
because we were the minority said luis sabines of the latin 
chamber of commerce now the blacks are the minority and i think 
they should be represented fair is fair 
carollo has called dawkins the worse commissioner in miami 
history and a political terrorist for such dawkins comments as 
warning he might get the brothers out there and burn it down 
when commissioners were discussing locating an antiaids clinic in 
a black neighborhood 
some blacks were upset when dawkins engineered a 500000 loan 
from a fund for an innercity swimming pool to a little havana 
theater project 
also opposing dawkins are clarence patterson a former city 
official former assistant police chief alfredo bared and 
businessmen willy chavez and jl correa 
challenging ms kennedy are businessman manolo reyes black 
community activist carole ann taylor political newcomer kevin 
marshall and miriam alonso disqualified two years ago for 
electionsrules violations and liberty city shopkeeper prentice 
rasheed best known for gaining exoneration on manslaughter charges 
after his homemade booby trap killed a burglar

maine voters face two nuclear ballot 
questions tuesday one on waste disposal and the other a 
referendumforced proposal calling for a ban on continued testing 
of unarmed cruise missiles over maine 
the navy called a news conference thursday in portland to 
reiterate its position that cruise missile testing is safe but 
spokesmen denied they were campaigning against the maine ballot 
proposal 
while passage would not bind the navy to stop tests a yes 
vote could have an impact on the nuclear arms race says the 
coalition for the cruise missile referendum 
supporters also say passage would help prompt political action 
to halt the missiles 
gerald miller technical director of the navys cruise missile 
project said thursday that all the tests have been conducted 
without injury he acknowledged that if the maine question passes 
similar movements could crop up in southern and western states 
where the cruise missiles are flown 
maine is one of five states where dummy tomahawk missiles are 
flown in navy test missions in the maine tests the missiles are 
launched from submarines off the coast and fly to the western part 
of the state 
the coalitions eric johnson said the tests advance a system 
that is unnecessary because the united states already has a nuclear 
arsenal that could wipe out its adversaries many times over 
johnson also calls the 11 billion weapon a waste of taxpayers 
money and says its development seriously impedes nuclear 
armsreduction initiatives 
the navys robert holsapple noting that 75 percent of the 
appropriations for the program already have been made stressed 
last week that 3300 of the 4030 missiles envisioned in the 
program will carry conventional arms 
he defends tomahawks as a balance against the relatively strong 
conventional forces of the soviet union and warsaw pact nations 
deploying cruise missiles on 200 surface ships and submarines also 
would complicate soviet targeting he said 
the maine nuclear referendum committee is working against voter 
ratification of a wastedisposal contract that would allow maine to 
dump lowlevel waste at a nevada site for three years they say it 
would do nothing to establish a permanent site to help maine comply 
with federal requirements that it take responsibility for its own 
lowlevel waste he said 
gov john r mckernan is urging passage of what he says is a 
necessary contingency in the event the south carolina dump now 
accepting maines waste decides to close its doors to the state 
passage also would give generators principally the maine 
yankee atomic plant which produces 83 percent of the states waste 
by volume more time to build longterm storage sites according 
to advocates of passage

stripes are returning to the north dakota 
penitentiary but not for the prisoners 
rather the state prisons guards will be issued new uniforms 
with pinstripes to replace the current green militarystyle garb 
the green was just plain ugly i hate green said warden tom 
powers who decided to get rid of the old uniforms 
the new uniforms are part of powers philosophy that 
correctional officers are more than guards these days powers who 
took charge of the prison a year ago likes to think of his 
employees as correctional counselors 
the old uniforms standard issue for more than a decade 
featured forest green slacks and a light green shirt that had 
contrasting forest green epaulets military creases militarystyle 
flap pockets and a policetype sleeve patch 
the new outfit has none of that medium gray polyester slacks 
will be worn with either the whiteandgray pinstriped shirt or a 
blueandwhite oxford striped shirt 
powers said the officers picked those combinations 
he decided to ditch the old outfit because of his experiment the 
last several months with casual uniforms on officers in the 
privileged housing units a mediumsecurity unit and the state 
prison farm 
he found that the officers in those units liked the new uniforms 
and they had the desired effect of making the officers more 
approachable to the inmates

polly ketron didnt want friends and 
relatives to worry about arrangements for her funeral so she is 
taking care of them herself 
the service is scheduled for saturday two days later mrs 
ketron will celebrate her 76th birthday 
im planning on having a good crowd she said at my age 
i have a lot of friends 
nothing really special is planned for the funeral except that 
she will be sitting close to the front of the chapel 
im not going to get in the casket or anything she said 
mrs ketron who has no children and no surviving brothers and 
sisters said she didnt want friends and other relatives worrying 
about her funeral 
i wanted it so that whenever i die they can take me out for a 
graveside service she said 
mrs ketrons husband andrew ketron died seven years ago 
she mulled the idea of a prearranged funeral as she calls 
it before approaching the funeral home and friends with her plan 
she noted that the funeral home prefers to call the service a 
memorial 
rye fleenor a friend of mrs ketrons and a spokesman for the 
funeral home said he thought her request was a joke when they 
discussed it in his office recently 
several days later however mrs ketron called to confirm some 
of the details and fleenor realized she was deadly serious 
she had wanted fleenor a retired minister to preach but he 
told her it was his day off 
the rev hubert overlay also a retired minister will 
officiate overlay said he has no objections to mrs ketrons idea 
its rather odd for someone to want this but when you think 
it over its not too bad he said she wants to hear whats 
being said about her 
he doesnt think mrs ketrons presence at the service will 
distract him 
shes a mighty fine person he said 
mrs ketron is not the first person to have her funeral before 
she died in fact its getting to be kind of a tradition in this 
mountain region of northeast tennessee 
paul c blevins of nearby shady valley held his funeral in 1976 
in his front yard attracting hundreds of people he died in 1987 
at the age of 76 and was buried in a casket that he built

a female jogger who was raped and left for dead 
in a brutal central park attack has made a remarkable recovery 
and could be capable of fully regaining her faculties a doctor 
said thursday 
we are hopeful but not certain of a 100 percent recovery 
said the doctor familiar with her case who spoke on the condition 
of anonymity 
the woman now 29 has been at gaylord hospital in wallingford 
conn where she is undergoing intensive mental and physical 
therapy and rehabilitation 
the new york times reported in its friday editions that the 
doctor found the woman has regained a zest for life that is 
impossible to quench 
he said she still has no recollection of the attack and 
declined to speculate if she ever will however the doctor told 
the times that she has been given the full details of the crime and 
has a complete understanding of what happened to her 
a medical report on her was prepared and made available thursday 
to lawyers defending youths charged in the april 19 attack

nightly run in central park when she was jumped by a gang of youths 
at least one of the youths who participated in the attack said 
he thought she was dead when they left her 
she was found bloodied severely beaten and barely breathing in 
a puddle of mud about three hours after the attack 
police investigating the case said they thought she would die 
when she was taken to metropolitan hospital where doctors said she 
had lost nearly 80 percent of her bodys blood they also said that 
head blows inflicted by a brick and a metal bar had damaged her 
brain 
but now the doctor said she has made a startling recovery and 
that she has begun regaining physical and mental skills which 
doctors at first thought she may never regain the source did not 
elaborate 
doctors have said the woman would be physically capable of 
appearing as a prosecution witness when the six youths indicted in 
connection with the attack go on trial

the decision to hold next months superpower summit 
off the coast of malta might have been unthinkable in washington a 
few years ago when the mediterranean island was under fire for its 
close ties with nearby libya 
but ever since the socialists were voted out in 1986 after 16 
years in power malta has loosened ties with col moammar gadhafi 
and moved closer to the united states and western europe 
diplomats say the islands improved ties with washington its 
central location in the mediterranean and its official policy of 
neutrality and nonalignment apparently played a role in the 
decision to hold the dec 23 shipboard summit by president bush 
and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev in maltese waters 
this would have been virtually inconceivable three years 
ago a western diplomat in valletta the maltese capital said 
thursday 
malta still has extensive trade and commercial ties with its 
southern neighbor libya but political and military relations have 
been downgraded 
there is this impression formed abroad that we were too 
closely aligned with the libyans prime minister edward fenech 
adami said shortly after his nationalist party swept to victory in 
may 1986 this will not happen under the new government 
libya has helped us a lot in the past and we shall maintain 
our friendly relations he added but maltese policies will no 
longer be identified with libyan policies malta should not align 
itself particularly in a military way with libya 
one of fenech adamis first official acts was to scrap part of a 
1984 friendship treaty with libya calling for exchange of military 
and security information it was under this pact that malta gave 
advance warning to libya of the us air raids on tripoli and 
benghazi in april 1986 
maltese air traffic controllers told their libyan counterparts 
that warplanes were approaching but libya apparently didnt act on 
the information and was surprised by the bombing raids which 
president reagan said were intended to punish tripoli for its 
alleged support of international terrorism 
fenech adamis government says it is no longer honoring the 
securitysharing agreement with libya and the clause is expected to 
be formally dropped when the friendship treaty comes up for 
renegotiation this month 
in another sign of the islands rapprochement with the west 
fenech adami also scratched a clause from the preamble of a 1981 
treaty with the soviet union that said malta would consult with 
moscow in case of a threat to peace 
the previous administration felt more comfortable with eastern 
europe said the western diplomat in malta speaking on condition 
of anonymity the present adminstration sees itself as western 
european in outlook 
maltas tilt to libya began after independence from britain in 
1964 when a british nato base closed fulfilling thenprime 
minister dom mintoffs desires for an independent and nonaligned 
state that would be a fortress of peace in the central 
mediterranean 
mintoff developed close relations with tripoli and wooed the 
soviet union and north korea 
libyan investment and oil helped malta survive economically 
after it shut down nato headquarters in 1971 and again in 1979 
when the last of british military installations was closed 
today fenech adami is seeking full membership in the european 
economic community and has liberalized tax laws in an effort to 
lure foreign investment 
but libyan economic influence in malta remains strong a factor 
that continues to irritate the united states 
the outgoing us ambassador to malta peter sommer said last 
month that usmaltese relations have shown marked improvement 
in the past two years but warned that continued friendly ties with 
libya could hinder american investment in the island 
during a trip to rome in 1987 fenech adami was asked about the 
american view that it is best to isolate gadhafi in all fields 
of course that position is appreciated by my goverment he 
said but you cant ignore geography we are only 140 
kilometers 87 miles from libya

learn the secrets of gaining rabbinic approval for their products 
eitan eisman director of chief sephardi rabbi mordechai

outside the rabbinate the likely culprits being manufacturers 
seeking crucial kosher stamps showing that their products meet 
jewish dietary laws 
we have been holding a lot of discussions about food he 
said there are a lot of interested parties who would like to 
know what is being said 
israel television showed one wireless microphone hidden inisde 
an office file in a room where discussions on the stamps were held

but both groups denied that

out that religious law forbids eavesdropping and chief ashkenazi

the us government can halt federal funds for 
family planning programs that include abortionrelated services a 
federal appeals court has ruled 
in an opinion made public thursday the 2nd us circuit court 
of appeals in manhattan upheld a lower court ruling allowing the 
funding cuts 
a department of health and human services rule adopted in 1988 
prohibits the use of title x funds for programs that assist a woman 
in obtaining an abortion such as abortion counseling and referrals 
the rule also prohibits funding for activities that encourage 
promote or advocate abortion 
title x funds are the largest source of federal funding for 
family planning services the opinion said 
the panel ruled that the restrictions do not violate the freedom 
of speech of health care providers and that the limits on 
counseling services do not violate the rights of pregnant women 
the plaintiffs who include private and public agencies will 
probably ask for an injunction against enforcement of the 
regulations pending a ruling by the us supreme court said 
suzanne lynn chief of the civil rights bureau for the state 
attorney generals office who represented the state of new york in 
appealing the regulations 
the regulations make it impossible to give quality counseling 
to pregnant women said lynn 
this is a frightening decision in terms of the rights of women 
to obtain abortions and the rights of health care providers and 
women to speak about things related to medical care agreed 
rachael pine lawyer for the reproductive freedom project of the 
american civil liberties union 
the health and human services regulation was also appealed in 
colorado and in massachusetts in both states a lower court issued 
an injunction against the regulations pending appeals pine said 
those appealing the regulation in new york included the state of 
new york new york city the new york city health and hospitals 
corp planned parenthood of nyc planned parenthood of 
westchesterrockland and health services of hudson county nj

this little town cant get any respect 
the pennsylvania department of transportation has consistently 
misspelled the name of the borough of 5800 people as 
swoyerville and the error has stayed in the department 
computer for two years 
last winter the mispelling showed up on a traffic sign at the 
corner of wyoming avenue and welles street it was corrected but 
lately residents have been discovering that their drivers licenses 
and car registration certificates also carry the error 
the mistake is understandable since at some times in its 
history the borough was called swoyerville after a colliery owner 
whose last name was swoyer 
but at least one resident is really annoyed 
jonathan spohrer said he has been driving around for three 
months with an expired drivers license because he refuses to apply 
for a new license as long as the transportation department 
misspells the towns name 
im a perfectionist just to look at it the misspelling 
really bothers me said spohrer a 29yearold lawyer 
douglas tobin director of the bureau of driver licensing said 
the departments computer was programmed a few years ago to spell 
the names of towns and cities the name was programmed into the 
computer incorrectly and the computer wont recognize any spelling 
other than swoyerville 
department officials have been unable to change the spelling on 
spohrers license renewal card though he said he asked for a 
correction three times 
tobin said that the department will reprogram the computer as 
soon as possible though he was not sure how long it would take

attorney general dick thornburgh says house 
democrats are bringing partisan politics into the investigation of 
federal housing scandals by forcing him to take the first step 
toward naming a special prosecutor 
democrats on the house judiciary committee formally asked 
thornburgh on thursday to appoint a special prosecutor to 
investigate former housing secretary samuel r pierce jr and other 
officials linked to allegations of wrongdoing at the department of 
housing and urban development during the reagan administration 
under federal law thornburgh must tell congress within 30 days 
whether he finds grounds to open a preliminary investigation 
thornburgh said he would report to congress as provided for in 
that legislation 
but he charged the letter making the request and the two 
congressmen leading the push reps charles schumer dny and 
bruce morrison dconn thrust partisan politics into this 
matter which has until now been handled in a nonpartisan 
professional way by the congress hud and this department 
even more distressing is the assertion by the congressmen that 
criminal acts have been committed before criminal investigations 
have been completed thornburgh said 
nineteen of the 20 democratic members of the house judiciary 
committee signed the letter making the formal request for a 
prosecutor 
they said evidence gathered by a house subcommittee probing the 
hud scandals raises a serious possibility of criminal conduct 
they cited possible perjury and conspiracy to defraud the 
government by pierce or other former top housing officials 
i believe that crimes were committed at hud said morrison 
we dont know whether secretary pierce was responsible for that 
criminal conduct but we do know that without a special prosecutor 
we will never find out 
pierces attorney paul l perito said he was confident the 
justice department would deny the request after reviewing 
transcripts of the house investigation 
perito said the committees proceedings contain not one shred 
of evidence to form a basis that crimes have been committed or that 
mr pierce was involved in commission of any crime 
under the independent counsel law a majority of the members of 
either party on the committee can trigger the firststep review by 
the attorney general 
if thornburgh opens a preliminary investigation he has 90 days 
to conduct it and decide whether to ask a threejudge panel of the 
us circuit court of appeals to appoint a special prosecutor 
formally known as an independent counsel 
the request came as the house government operations subcommittee 
that has been investigating allegations of fraud 
influencepeddling and mismanagement was ending its probe stymied 
by the refusal of pierce and three other former top officials to 
testify 
schumer said in announcing the request sam pierce entrusted 
with programs for the poor and powerless instead gave those 
programs to the very rich and the best politically connected 
there is ample evidence of wrongdoing at hud but there is 
stonewalling at the top he said the only way to get to the 
bottom of the mess at hud is through the appointment of an 
independent counsel 
pierce testified voluntarily last may before the government 
operations subcommittee on housing and employment but when 
subpoenaed for further appearances this fall pierce invoked his 
fifth amendment right against selfincrimination and refused to 
testify 
three other former top hud officials including pierces two 
former top executive assistants deborah gore dean and lance 
wilson have also refused to testify 
to support their contention that there may have been a 
conspiracy to defraud the government the congressmen said evidence 
suggests grants were dispensed on the basis of favoritism and 
without regard to the requirements of federal law 
on the perjury allegation the congressmen cited pierces may 25 
testimony that i did not have hands on the administration of 
federal housing laws and apparent contradictions by other 
witnesses

lawmakers are optimistic president bush will 
accept a 305 billion defense bill that cuts 11 billion from the 
strategic defense initiative and provides one less b2 stealth 
bomber in fiscal 1990 
apart from sdi on the whole its the bill one which we find 
acceptable sen john warner of virginia ranking republican on 
the senate armed services committee said shortly after 
congressional negotiators adopted the legislation thursday 
the bill still must be approved by the full house and senate 
and critics were outspoken about a defense blueprint that provides 
all but 150 million bush sought for landbased nuclear missiles 
and restores some funds for conventional weapons the president 
sought to kill 
where a weapon is built and by whom has become more important 
than how much it costs is it needed and whether it contributes to 
our national security said rep larry j hopkins rky a 
member of the house armed services committee 
were buying too many bigticket items with no hard choices 
said rep john kasich rohio another member of the panel 
the object of their anger was the conferees decision to provide 
money for the marine corps v22 osprey the aircraft that takes 
off like a helicopter but can fly like a plane and the navys 
f14d tomcat jet fighter 
the tiltrotor osprey which bush sought to cancel will receive 
255 million in research and development money but no procurement 
funds 
this decision will save hundreds of jobs for philadelphians 
rep tom foglietta dpa a member of the house armed services 
panel said in expressing his support for the bill 
the negotiators also agreed to buy 18 f14ds in the fiscal year 
that began oct 1 but none in fiscal 1991 the legislation also 
requires the manufacturer grumman corp of new york to sign up 
for termination according to sen sam nunn dga chairman of 
the senate armed services committee 
the debate over the cancellation of the f14d was the most 
contentious of the nearly eight weeks of debate over the two widely 
divergent house and senate defense bills lawmakers said 
warner said that in his 20 years of defense conferences ive 
never seen such forceful if not ruthless lobbying by some 
groups 
defense secretary dick cheney said he was generally pleased 
with the bill because it provides for a strong national defense 
and the basic principles of the presidents defense budget 
recommendations 
in a pentagon statement cheney noted the bill recognizes that 
we cant afford lowerpriority defense programs such as the v22 
aircraft production and after fiscal year 1990 f14d aircraft 
production 
but cheney expressed some disappointment with the cut in sdi 
saying i would have preferred a higher level of funding for 
sdi 
the bill provides 379 billion for the antimissile shield 
popularly known as star wars 357 billion in pentagon money and 
220 million in department of energy dollars 
that represents about 200 million less than the amount 
earmarked in fiscal 1989 and the first decrease in funds since 
former president reagan proposed the program six years ago 
the star wars total falls between the 28 billion approved by 
the house and the 43 billion adopted by the senate 
nunn said the cut in star wars spending reflected the 
diminishing congressional support for a program the bush 
administration has been unable to define 
the bill also includes 
about 11 billion for the railbased mx multiplewarhead 
missile and the truckbased midgetman singlewarhead about 150 
million less than bush had requested for the two nuclear weapons 
cheney had favored financing only the mx but bush opted for both 
funds for two b2 stealth bombers in fiscal 1990 one less than 
the bush administration proposed and money for components for five 
in fiscal 1991 the batwinged aircraft has come under 
congressional criticism for its expensive price tag of 530 million 
apiece

president bushs offer to halt his drive for a 
capital gains tax cut this year could end a bitter congressional 
deadlock over mustpass fiscal legislation a minimum wage bill and 
other measures 
bush and senate republicans offered thursday to stop trying to 
add the capital gains provision to debtlimit legislation that must 
be approved by next week 
i deeply regret the tone of partisanship that has entered the 
economic policy debate bush said in a written statement now 
the stalemate must be broken 
democratic house and senate leaders said they liked much of the 
presidents proposal and indicated a deal breaking the legislative 
logjam might come soon 
we are heartened by the statement made by the president today 
including his apparent decision to terminate his effort with regard 
to capital gains senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine told reporters 
my view is were very very close said senate budget 
committee chairman james sasser dtenn 
but while extending an olive branch on capital gains one of 
his top legislative priorities the president left a threat 
dangling over congress 
he promised that if lawmakers failed to send him legislation 
cutting at least 14 billion from the deficit and containing no 
unrelated provisions he would leave 161 billion in cuts in most 
federal programs made under the grammrudman law in effect all 
year 
clearly this approach would not be a first choice for any of 
us bush said it is however a necessary discipline in the 
absence of more satisfactory action 
the presidents threat to leave the grammrudman cuts in effect 
sparked hot retorts from democrats who said the slashes would 
devastate education environment antidrug and other programs bush 
has said are his priorities 
make no mistake about it when you agree that these 
acrosstheboard cuts are going to take place it is really a 
cowards approach to deficit reduction said house budget 
committee chairman leon panetta dcalif 
the presidents insistence on a deficitreduction measure minus 
unrelated issues was an effort to strip a number of 
democraticbacked programs from the house version of the bill 
these proposals include an expensive broadening of federal child 
care efforts 
bush said he would continue seeking a capital gains reduction 
this year but by offering to keep the proposal off the debtlimit 
and deficitreduction bills he essentially abandoned his best 
chance for success 
for weeks republicans have been trying to find a way to ensure 
passage of their proposal to cut the tax on capital gains which 
are profits from sales of property stocks and other holdings 
because they are short of the 60 votes they need for passage 
under special senate procedures gop lawmakers have tried attaching 
the proposal to several bills that have better prospects for 
passage 
these include a deficitreduction measure legislation extending 
the governments borrowing limit and a bill providing aid to 
poland and hungary the result has been to delay action on all of 
these measures 
thursday another bill was derailed a bipartisan package 
raising the minimum wage for the first time since 1981 
sen steven symms ridaho refused to let the chamber debate 
the measure unless he was permitted to offer amendments reducing 
the capital gains tax and repealing both the new medicare program 
for the seriously ill and a business tax law 
symms action provoked a volley from angry democrats who accused 
him of blocking a bill to help the poor in an attempt to help the 
wealthy 
ive seen a republican party that day in day out stands up and 
fights for the rich of this country and is totally indifferent to 
the problems of those who earn far less said sen howard 
metzenbaum dohio how cruel can you be 
unless the governments 28 trillion borrowing limit is 
extended next week it will face an unprecedented default that 
would boost federal borrowing costs and according to some 
economists wreak havoc on the worlds financial markets

a defense department official said thursday 
that nicaragua was one of several places in the world where the 
soviet unions conduct belied the spirit of political reform it has 
professed at home 
we are still awaiting a soviet policy toward regional conflict 
that fully complements its new thinking said paul wolfowitz the 
departments undersecretary of defense of policy 
wolfowitz in remarks made at fifth general chautauqua 
conference on ussoviet relations at the university of 
pittsburgh delivered sharper criticism of soviet policy than 
secretary of state james a baker 3rd has in recent speeches 
the pentagon official joined a senior soviet community party 
official in a discussion of the two nations roles in trouble spots 
around the world 
wolfovitz said that while the soviet union had halted its own 
shipments to the sandinista regime eastern bloc and cuban aid 
continues to flow to managua he complained that moscow had failed 
to exert its influence to curtail those thirdparty shipments 
nikolai v shishlin a senior staff member of the central 
committee of the community party argued however that the united 
states could have a greater influence in stemming those arms 
shipments if it were to ease its political and economic embargo in 
cuba 
shishlin also criticized nicaraguan president daniel ortega for 
abandoning his regimes 19month ceasefire with the contras 
my own personal opinion is that ortegas decision is an 
emotional one and the political consequences will be negative he 
said through a translator at the same time i would like to 
believe that this decision can be reversed 
at the same time however shishlin said ortegas decision 
should be viewed as a response to excessive pressure on the 
sandinista government by the united states 
the exchange of statements doesnt speak highly of either 
president bush or ortega he said 
ortega announced the suspension of the ceasefire earlier this 
week contending that it was necessary in order to respond to 
increasing contra attacks within nicaragua 
wolfowitz also criticized soviet policy toward afghanistan 
while praising foreign minister eduard a schvardnadzes recent 
mea culpa for the soviet invasion of that country wolfowitz said 
moscow continued to send billions of dollars in military aid to its 
client regime in kabul 
this pattern of behavior he said is all the more ironic 
at a time when the soviet union is facing up to the need to bring 
greater openness and democracy into the political process at home 
with a boldness that has captures the worlds imagination 
responding to the criticism shishlin alluded to american 
assistance to the resistance there in asking whose missiles are 
striking kabul killing women and children 
fielding a question from the audience wolfowitz sternly 
resisted the suggestion that us policies in countries such as 
nicaragua south korea panama and vietnam were the moral 
equivalents of soviet actions criticized by the united states 
we certainly admit to shortcomings but nothing compared to 
afghanistan he said law 
despite the disagreements which appeared to fly in the face of 
a recent warming of us policy toward the soviets the overall 
tone of the morning session continued the spirit of hope that has 
suffused four days of talks in pittsburgh 
the world really is changing and were working to take 
advantage of it wolfowitz said near the end of the discussion 
referring to next months shipboard summit shishlin said the 
meeting of bush and gorbachev will allow them to kill the cold war 
to stop it the end of the cold war will allow the two 
countries to play a different role perhaps a smaller role but a 
more creative role

advocates for the elderly say tighter 
government regulation of medigap rates is needed to keep 
insurance companies from unjustly boosting the premiums paid by 
millions of older americans 
about 70 percent of the nations 33 million medicare 
beneficiaries have medigap policies with premiums averaging 800 
in 989 to supplement government health care benefits 
prices shot up across the country last year even though 
medicare took on more of the health care burden and costs are 
headed still higher in 1990 according to a report released 
thursday by a subcommittee of the house select committee on aging 
shockingly despite the new medicare coverage the states 
reported increases in policy costs of up to 133 percent the 
subcommittee on health and longterm care reported every state 
reported increases in the cost of at least some of the medigap 
policies sold there 
subcommittee chairman edward roybal dcalif said the 
increases in many cases were unwarranted but many older americans 
dare not switch medigap plans because long waiting periods often 
precede the start of coverage for people with medical conditions 
they are virtually trapped in one policy and at the mercy of 
the companies who market those policies roybal said he called 
for tighter government regulation of medigap rate increases citing 
subcommittee findings that insurance companies in most states are 
allowed to charge what they wish 
even public utilities must show just cause for rate hikes 
roybal said why shouldnt insurance companies be held 
accountable for their rate increases 
linda jenckes a vice president of the health insurance 
association of america told the subcommittee that medigap price 
changes over the last year reflect increases in both the cost and 
volume of claims for benefits she estimated the average medigap 
premium rose 10 percent to 12 percent this year 
prices are likely to rise another 7 percent to 12 percent in 
1990 due to rising health costs but the increases are expected to 
average 20 percent to 25 percent if congress repeals the 
catastrophic program she said 
john gilmore an independent health insurance agent in naples 
fla told the subcommittee that some companies may use the 
anticipated repeal or reduction of medicares new catastrophic 
healthcare benefits as an excuse for price gouging next year 
i worry about those seniors with chronic illnesses who will be 
forced to keep their present coverage no matter what the cost 
said gilmore joining the call for tighter regulation of medigap 
rates 
james firman president of the united seniors health 
cooperative said insurers are taking advantage of a climate of 
fear and confusion to reap big profits on medigap policies 
they are unfairly capitalizing on the fact that it is very 
difficult and expensive for seniors to switch from one plan to 
another he said

vietnam is shocking the global rice trade with 
a 13fold boost in exports over last year a feat that could spell 
eventual competition for us producers says an agriculture 
department economist 
vietnam exported only 97000 tons of rice in 1988 said sara 
schwartz of the departments economic research service but 
vietnamese shipments this year are expected to total 13 million 
tons and 1990 exports are forecast at 1 million tons 
the exports are lowquality rice bought by third world 
countries including the ivory coast and guinea in africa and 
india and the philippines 
vietnams prices are below those of thailand which expects to 
export about six million tons this year and accounts for about 40 
percent of the world rice trade the vietnamese shipments would 
make up about 9 percent of global exports 
schwartz said in a telephone interview thursday we really 
dont know what has brought on the huge surge in vietnams rice 
exports of where it is getting the surplus rice for sale overseas 
available data shows there has been a decline in rice 
consumption in vietnam but there a lot of murkiness about the 
actual conditions she said 
we havent seen any news reports that theres been any 
shortages in vietnam but our data is so tenuous that were 
really not sure schwartz said we really know very little 
the united states is one of the major rice exporters and is 
expected to ship 28 million tons in calendar 1989 the most since 
the 1981 record of 3 million tons exports are expected to decline 
to around 25 million tons in 1990 reducing the us global market 
share to about 18 percent 
although schwartz said it remains to be seen whether vietnam 
maintains its export momentum its move into the export market 
eventually could have some impact on us rice shipments 
but we dont know she said right now they are in the 
lowquality markets and were not we dont sell a lot of rice to 
their customers if they would improve their quality by quite a 
bit they would impact on our markets but theyre not there at all 
yet 
an analysis written by schwartz noted this years brisk us 
exports have been boosted by rising world demand and competitive 
us prices larger shipments to latin america also are important 
mexico alone may purchase 180000 tons of us rice by the end 
of the year and continued exports to peru ecuador and venezuela 
are expected the report said steady demand by the european 
economic community and middle eastern countries is also keeping 
us exports strong 
in her analysis schwartz said vietnam was a net exporter of 
rice before 1964 but shifted during the war she counted both north 
and south vietnam in computing historical production and export 
statistics 
after 1964 vietnam became a net rice importer importing as 
much as one million tons a year at the height of the war between 
1981 and 1988 imports averaged 230000 tons a year and exports 
averaged 85000 tons 
schwartz said recent policy changes may more fully explain the 
recent gains in production and availability of rice on the 
international market 
agricultural reform in china led to phenomenal growth in farm 
production and if vietnam repeats the pattern it could be become 
a major force in the worlds rice markets she said 
a recent paper presented by vietnamese officials described how 
land and all privately owned capital assets were redistributed 
after the war ended in 1975 crop decisions and marketing were 
centrally planned production dropped 
attempts were made beginning in 1981 to overhaul the system and 
in 1988 individuals and families were allowed to lease land for 10 
to 20 years other reforms began last year including permission 
for vietnamese farmers to market their own grain instead of selling 
it to the government 
it may be too soon to attribute vietnams recent production 
and export gains solely to the 1988 policy reforms schwartz 
said they could be due instead to a shortterm consumption 
decline however if the reforms have led to production increases 
the countrys 1989 export performance may be more than a shortterm 
phenomenon

a group that puts antidrug ads on television 
and in newspapers says the spots are helping cut marijuana and 
cocaine use in areas where they saturate the media 
the mediaadvertising partnership for a drugfree america said 
thursday that a survey indicated marijuana use among adults 
declined 33 percent and cocaine use was down 15 percent in 
communities where the advertisements were broadcast and printed in 
newspapers 
president bush speaking at a white house ceremony where the 
survey results were released said the organization demonstrates 
the best in the american spirit of service to others 
you have the power to change americas mind about drugs 
bush told the gathering of representatives from the advertising 
companies production firms and media outlets that are involved in 
the project 
seventyfive firms nationwide have produced 56 tv commercials 
50 radio spots and 106 print ads for the campaign since it was 
launched in march 1987 
media organizations have contributed 310 million in time and 
space to show the ads the group said 
among the ads is one showing an egg frying in hot grease with 
the tag line this is your brain on drugs 
negative attitudes toward drugs were increased in places where 
such ads were used according to an attitude and user survey headed 
by the new yorkbased gordon s black corp about 7000 people were 
questioned for the survey 
attitudinal improvement was much greater in those communities 
where exposure to the ads was the greatest black said in a news 
release 
however youths ages 13 to 17 still showed only modest 
improvement in attitudes toward drugs the survey found 
among other findings the study showed marijuana use among 
adults dropped 12 percent from 1987 to 1988 in areas with high 
saturation of the ads and 33 percent from 1988 to 1989 
bush lauded the groups efforts youve shown that the private 
sector can do what legislation alone can never do change 
attitudes he said 
some antidrug activists questioned the studys findings 
peggy charren president of action for childrens television 
said in an interview thursday that she was wary of a poll financed 
by the same group that produced the ads 
i hope this is right she said of the survey results i 
would be surer that it was right if the people doing the research 
had nothing to do with the people doing the advertising 
this isnt all bad but i would worry about thinking this was 
the solution to the drug problem she said

the sicilian mafia has joined colombias top drug 
ring to ship cocaine into europe and the northeastern united 
states fbi officials said thursday in announcing a trafficking 
indictment here 
twelve people in miami new york detroit and colombia were 
indicted in the case including john galatalo 44 the alleged 
middleman between the two smuggling groups said fbi officials 
this is the first real hard evidence of this nexus and close 
relationship between colombian cocaine trafficking and sicilian 
mafia members said timothy mcnally assistant special agent in 
charge of the fbi in miami 
the indictment accuses the defendants of shipping 30kilogram 
loads of cocaine by automobile and train from miami to new york and 
philadelphia between 1985 and 1987 then in late 1987 galatalo 
allegedly arranged a 600kilogram shipment to be routed through 
aruba to the mediterranean for distributon by the sicilian mafia in 
italy 
fbi spokesman paul miller said the ring was buying its cocaine 
from defendant angel leon sanchez 39 a member of the barranquilla 
cartel which is directly connected to colombias medellin cartel 
they opened a corridor from medellin to southern euorope 
miller said 
sanchez is believed to in colombia and the fbi will request his 
extradition 
three of the defendants including one in miami and two in new 
york are currently in custody and several others are expected to 
turn themselves in to authorities in the next two days 
galatalo of miami was out on bond on a june indictment now 
superceded by the charges a federal grand jury handed up wednesday 
he is expected to appear friday at an initial hearing in the new 
case 
he could face between 10 years and life in prison if convicted 
of running a continuing criminal enterprise 
another defendant angelo fontana 36 of miami was also free on 
bond in the earlier case and was expected to surrender 
the fbi praised italian police for their cooperation in the 
twoyear investigation and said while the 34count indictment was 
unlikely to make a major dent in the cocaine supply it had hit 
highlevel traffickers 
were interested in major defendants major organizational 
players who put together this conspiracy and the shipments 
mcnally said in this indictment we think we have it 
the indictment says the italianborn galatolo arranged for the 
importation of cocaine from colombia to miami then traveled 
extensively to new york aruba and milan to make arrangements for 
shipments to the northeast and europe 
others named in the indictment are waldino jesus aponte ramero

ten years after iranian radicals seized the 
us embassy in tehran subjecting american diplomats to outrageous 
horrors the world has taken several positive spins 
superpower relations are improved summits are an annual event 
there is a treaty on the books banning intermediaterange nuclear 
missiles negotiators are working on another to sharply reduce us 
and soviet stockpiles of longrange rockets 
but terrorism has not receded as a threat to mankind president 
carters patient probing eventually brought the americans home from 
tehran but only after 444 miserable days in captivity 
president reagans stern threat of swift and effective 
retribution did not prevent the bombing of the us embassy in 
beirut in april 1983 killing 17 americans or the slaughter of 241 
marines and sailors near the citys airport less than six months 
later 
reagan white house operatives robert mcfarlane john poindexter 
and oliver north sought to barter arms for iranian moderation and 
the release of american hostages in lebanon but they failed as 
well 
the us bombing of tripoli and benghazi in april 1986 may have 
quieted libyan col moammar gadhafi down a bit but the attack did 
not put terrorism back in its box 
just this week 
iranian radicals made plans for a rally of hatred outside the 
former us embassy on saturday to mark the 10th anniversary of its 
seizure 
iran approved a law wednesday giving it the power to arrest 
americans anywhere and put them on trial 
gunmen in beirut the same day killed a saudi diplomat and 
wounded his driver hours later islamic holy war a proiranian 
group took responsibility for the assault 
over the last 10 years there have been signs of progress 
airport security is tighter libyas plan to build a chemical 
weapons plant was exposed by thensecretary of state george p 
shultz the west german government was forced to admit west german 
firms had been helping the libyans 
president bush proposed in september eliminating most us and 
soviet chemical weapons soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze went him one better and urged getting rid of all of 
them 
the idea is to set a standard for 40 nations meeting in geneva 
to ban the production of chemical weapons and as a result deny 
their use to terrorists 
the us and soviet proposals are a start in seeking a solution 
but some experts doubt that a completely reliable way of stopping 
all production everywhere can be devised 
in a new book final warning averting disaster in the new age 
of terrorism analyst robert kupperman and reporter jeff kamen 
offer the gloomy suggestion that the united states and its allies 
are about to enter an era of terrorist attacks deadlier than ever 
before 
the main reason is more sophisticated technology another 
ironically is the fact that democracies play by rules that 
sometimes protect terrorists 
a case in point from the book 
three years ago yu kikumura described as a member of the 
japanese red army a small global terror gang was arrested at 
schipol airport in amsterdam with a bomb concealed in a can of 
breakfast food in his luggage 
at trial though a dutch judge ruled the search of kikumuras 
luggage was illegal the case was dismissed and kikumura was 
deported to japan 
last year he was driving on the new jersey turnpike when a 
state trooper found three bombs hidden in his car in a 
confidential message at the trial last february the us attorney 
said kikumuras goal was mass slaughter of americans in 
retaliation for the raids on libya 
he was convicted but his lawyers said they would appeal on the 
grounds the trooper conducted an illegal search 
final warning stands as a message as well as a book title 
while kupperman and kamen conclude that terrorists have 
accomplished few of their goals to date the ability of a small 
number of hardcore trained and highly motivated agents to exploit 
the openness of free societies poses an awesome challenge 
the world will soon pay a high price for more than 20 years of 
collective cowardice and indecision by democracies that failed to 
take terrorism seriously and for a concomitant period of callous 
machiavellian use of terror by hostile governments the authors 
warn 
those hostile regimes correctly defined terror as a 
costeffective and plausibly deniable method of waging war which 
carries little if any risk to their lands 
nations that have employed terrorist groups as surrogates 
including syria iran and libya have only lately been called to 
account and with insignificant consequences

the house must decide whether to go along with 
a senate vote to reinstate oliver norths 23000 annual pension 
revoked after he was sentenced for illegally shredding documents in 
the irancontra scandal 
let the vendetta end said sen jesse helms rnc whose 
bill to restore norths pension was approved by the senate late 
thursday on a 7817 vote ollie north has been punished enough 
but despite that plea the debate over whether to give north 
back his retirement pay dredged up bitter partisan feelings 
stemming from president reagans efforts with north in a key role 
to evade congressional restrictions and fund the contra war in 
nicaragua 
we are asked to bend the law for someone who broke the law 
said sen tom harkin diowa norths defense was that he was 
just following orders but we settled that issue at nuremberg a 
reference to trials of nazis involved in world war ii atrocities 
the issue now goes to the house where similar legislation has 
been introduced but not yet acted on 
senate judiciary committee chairman joseph biden ddel said 
he would vote to put north in jail if he could but he dropped his 
opposition to the retirementpay measure after helms modified it to 
apply not just to north but to any military officer who may later 
be convicted of shredding documents 
even a felon deserves equal treatment under the law biden 
said i might want ollie north protecting me in a foxhole but i 
wouldnt want ollie north teaching my son or daughter ethics 
senators ignored warnings from colleagues like sen paul simon 
dill who said the move would set a bad precedent and invite 
future congressional tampering with criminal cases 
we should not on this floor change that sentence anymore than 
we should for zsa zsa gabor simon argued 
north a marine lieutenant colonel lost his retirement pay 
after he was sentenced july 5 to 1200 hours of community service 
and a 150000 fine on three felony counts he is appealing the 
convictions 
one of the counts shredding government documents stipulates 
that anyone convicted forfeit his office with the us 
government 
the general accounting office which adjudicates federal pay 
issues ruled norths status as a retired military officer came 
under that provision of the law and that forfeiting his office 
meant he no longer qualified for retirement pay the case marked 
the first time the 15yearold law had been applied to revoke 
someones pension 
technically military retirement pay is not a pension based on 
past service but a reduced salary for an officer who continues to 
hold a commission and remains subject to recall to active duty 
helms offered the change as an amendment to a spending bill in 
august but the matter was laid aside and sent to the senate 
judiciary committee for further study in a report this week the 
panel split along partisan lines on whether norths retirement 
should be reinstated 
biden and six of his democratic colleagues contended congress 
should take no action but rather leave it up to the navy and the 
courts to decide 
but the committees six minority republicans dissented saying 
the law that led to revocation of norths retirement pay was not 
intended to have such an effect a special relief bill for north 
would remedy ambiguities in the law in his case they argued 
the issue has taken on political symbolism far beyond its dollar 
value north is reportedly earning 25000 more than a years 
pension for each speech he gives on the lecture circuit but some 
conservatives view north as a hero who bore the brunt of blame for 
president reagan during the irancontra scandal 
this is a pension he fought and shed his blood for helms 
said rattling off a list of medals north won in vietnam this 
has been an unfair unwarranted hardship on col north and his 
family ollie this ones for you

the next two to three years will see record or 
nearrecord levels of the solar activity that disrupts radio 
communications and satellite operations a scientist predicts 
we are approaching the peak of the sunspot cycle said joe 
h allen of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration he 
predicted the sunspots will peak next february followed by solar 
flares that will reach their maximum one or two years later and 
magnetic storms at a high a few years afterward 
the sun is about three years into its 11year cycle of activity 
and allen said the february prediction comes from analysis of the 
previous 21 solar cycles 
already this year the suns activities have been at levels not 
reached since the late 1950s when the first satellites were put in 
orbit 
the activities began in march when a flare 36 times the size of 
earth possibly the largest ever recorded shot out from the sun 
in march some lowaltitude satellites went tumbling in orbit 
some stationary satellites lost some of their communications 
ability said allen in an interview noaas own goes 6 weather 
satellite lost one of its communications channels in august 
allen said august solar activity rivaled that of 1972 a 
landmark high the september event was larger he added and 
the october one was so much larger that it made us forget 
september 
solar flares affect the technical systems that support modern 
society by disorienting satellites in orbit halting highfrequency 
radio communications and increasing the radiation level at 
altitudes flown by the concorde supersonic airplanes 
the operational life of some satellites undoubtedly has been 
reduced by recent solar activity allen said that occurs because 
satellites become disoriented and use up irreplaceable onboard 
fuel to get back into proper operating attitudes

president bush plans to spend only a brief 
time on the island of malta before moving to a navy ship in the 
mediterranean for next months summit with soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev 
sketchy details of bushs plans were released by the white house 
on thursday along with a denial of any concern about his security 
on malta the island once had close ties with libyan col moammar 
gadhafi who is accused by the united states as being a sponsor of 
terrorism 
there are always security problems but we believe that they 
can be managed and that the presidents visit there will be secure 
and safe said white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
he said bush will fly to malta on dec 1 and meet briefly with 
the nations leaders then the president will be whisked to a navy 
guidedmissile cruiser offshore for the remainder of his stay 
bush is to meet with gorbachev on dec 2 and 3 and return to 
washington at the conclusion of the talks 
bush and gorbachev will meet on us and soviet ships on 
alternate days 
some members of bushs entourage including the white house 
press corps that covers the president will be housed in malta a 
pool of reporters is to be taken by helicopter or launch out to the 
ships to cover the superpower meetings 
fitzwater said it was the united states that suggested malta as 
the staging area 
malta an independent republic consisting of five islands lies 
58 miles south of sicily 220 miles north of libya and 180 miles 
east of tunisia 
once a close ally of libya malta has loosened political and 
military relations but still has strong trade and commercial ties 
and provides easy travel access to libyans 
the summit was a topic of discussion thursday when bush met in 
the oval office with imre pozsgay minister of state in hungary and 
a leading candidate in presidential elections this month 
speaking with reporters later pozsgay said the superpower talks 
would further detente and strengthen perestroika the process of 
economic reform in the soviet union 
all central european nations can only profit from it 
pozsgay said 
and naturally it would be very beneficial and advantageous 
to hungary if there is cooperation between the two superpowers

members of president bushs cabinet are often 
like the white house puppies dampening each others coats in a 
bid for his attention jokes national drug control director william 
j bennett 
bennett acknowledging that sometimes hes too damn quotable 
for my own good drew a roar of laughter thursday from the white 
house audience of more than 100 prominent media leaders later top 
spokesmen for various cabinet members responded the same way 
addressing the media leaders who came to the white house to 
learn the results of a survey on the impact of antidrug abuse ads 
they had run bennett began by praising bushs support for the war 
against drugs 
then he recounted a day when he and bush were leaving a 
cabinet meeting he looked out the window and there was millie and 
the puppies and he said you know sometimes its easy to get 
distracted when you should be thinking about cabinet affairs and 
once in a while my mind wanders and i see millie and the puppies 
and then i get back to work 
i said well thats sort of like the cabinet anyway mr 
president all those puppies pawing on each other stepping on each 
others heads all trying to get your attention bennett said as 
the audience burst out laughing 
its probably somewhat reminiscent of the cabinet doing other 
things to each other which i wont repeat here dampening each 
others coats shall we say but everybody trying to get the 
attention of mama he said 
bush decided not to include bennett in his cabinet even though 
congress created bennetts position director of the office of 
national drug control strategy as a cabinetlevel office 
bennett has maintained he doesnt mind being excluded from the 
cabinet where he served earlier as president reagans education 
secretary as long as he has the presidents support 
all the top spokesmen for cabinet members contacted thursday 
evening responded with laughter when told of bennetts remark 
cabinet members were out of town or had left their offices for the 
day by the time their reaction was sought 
its a good line said david runkel spokesman for attorney 
general dick thornburgh 
bob marx spokesman for transportation secretary sam skinner 
conceded when asked for a response were not going to be able to 
play hes not around to ask sounds like fun though 
steve goldstein spokesman for interior secretary manuel lujan 
controlled his chuckles to come up with a more serious response 
saying manuel lujan has known george bush for 20 years and if 
he needs to reach the president all he has to do is call 
bennetts deputy chief of staff david tell said whats the 
big deal its just a joke but sounded relieved to learn the 
administration spokesmen had responded with laughter 
bennett is known for his occasionally sharpedged humor and 
cutting comments and they have gotten him in trouble in the past 
during an education summit in september in charlottesville va 
bennett moderated a closed session with a number of governors and 
later publicly summed up what had been discussed 
there was pap standard democratic pap bennett said 
there was standard republican pap and there was stuff that 
rhymes with pap on both sides too 
two days later white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
bennett had been rebuked by white house chief of staff john sununu

will san francisco voters reward their 
world series losers with a downtown ballpark will they approve a 
measure that grants the same benefits to domestic partners that 
married couples get 
tune in nov 7 and find out as sex sports and bias dominate 
ballots across northern california 
some of the other ballot measures include repeal of an ordinance 
that bans discrimination against people with aids in the east bay 
community of concord and a vote by residents of tiny bolinas 
north of san francisco over whether to install signs directing 
drivers to their town 
coming on the heels of a devastating earthquake and a world 
series that pitted crossbay rivals oakland and san francisco the 
elections have generated large contributions controversy and 
national interest 
but some political analysts believe the quakes devastation may 
dim voter enthusiasm 
in san francisco measure s would allow unmarried and homosexual 
couples working for the city to formally establish their 
relationships as domestic partners complete with funeral and 
sick leave benefits 
proposition p would provide for the construction of a 
48000seat ballpark in the citys china basin district replacing 
chilly windswept candlestick park giants owner bob lurie has 
threatened to move the team if the measure fails san jose and 
sacramento are mentioned as possible new locales 
if it loses it shows that san franciscans dont have faith in 
themselves and their future said gerald newfarmer executive 
director of the san francisco chamber of commerce 
opponents of the stadium say it will result in gridlock and is 
an unnecessary expense 
some opponents of measure s which mayor art agnos backs claim 
the legislation is vague and could prove too costly for a city 
already financially strapped 
the rev charles mcilhenny of the first orthodox presbyterian 
church in san francisco said he sees no need for the special 
legislation for homosexuals and argues theres been no evidence 
of discrimination 
the measure is only for livein lovers gay or straight he 
said it provides some of the same benefits as marriage mcilhenny 
said without the attending responsibilities 
agnos had lobbied strongly for the stadium but after the oct 
17 earthquake he suspended his campaign the 115 million ballpark 
which would be built and financed by a private developer would 
require 2 million in annual city investment over the next 10 years 
despite agnos postquake reluctance to push for the new 
stadium the disaster may have actually rallied some voters to the 
idea 
a newspaper poll wednesday showed 49 percent of the voters 
opposed to the ballpark with 40 percent in favor and 11 percent 
undecided but the last prequake poll had shown the measure 
trailing by 21 percent and that was also before the rival 
athletics swept the giants 40 in the world series 
in scottsdale ariz meanwhile voters will decide the fate of 
a new baseball complex for the giants who train in that phoenix 
suburb each spring giants officials say they will move when their 
contract expires in 1991 unless the new facility is built 
in concord a large voter turnout was expected for a vote to 
repeal an ordinance banning discrimination in housing employment 
and other areas against aids victims 
the ordinance was approved by the city council then placed on 
the ballot after protests by outraged residents who collected 
10000 signatures 
the election marks the first time that an aids 
antidiscrimination issue has gone to a public vote 
here are some of the other issues facing voters 
in fremont northeast of san jose attorney james l fallon is 
running for one of two council seats as the citys first openly 
homosexual candidate sometimes one does not run to win 
sometimes one runs to make a point and the point im trying to 
make is to stimulate the debate on homosexuality in general and 
homosexuals in government fallon said 
in union city north of fremont voters will select one of two 
measures regulating construction on 5000 acres of scenic hills and 
canyons now zoned for agriculture and open space voters in nearby

a short daily walk can go a long way toward 
prolonging your life according to researchers whose study finds 
that even moderate exercise can help the most hardcore couch 
potatoes 
the positive aspect of the work is that it doesnt take a 
lot of exercise to make the kinds of changes that over the long run 
will save us years said george lesmes director of the center 
for exercise science and cardiovascular research at northeastern 
illinois university 
fitness gurus also welcomed the study in todays journal of the 
american medical association 
hallelujah theyre finally making some sense out of this 
thing said exercise video star richard simmons in a telephone 
interview from los angeles if you exercise if you take care of 
your body its the best thing in the world you do live longer 
the study by researchers at the institute for aerobics research 
in dallas indicated that if all the unfit people surveyed had 
become fit the death rates might have dropped by 9 percent in men 
and 153 percent in women 
and it doesnt take much to get into some semblance of fitness 
said steven n blair an epidemiologist and coauthor of the study 
the most sedentary the most unfit can get a lot of benefit if 
they just can move up the scale a ways to a level of moderate 
fitness blair said they dont have to become marathon runners 
thirty to 45 minutes of brisk walking each day will produce 
the moderate levels of fitness that are associated with much 
lower death rates he said 
he added that fewer than 10 percent of adult americans exercise 
at levels recommended by the surgeon general 
the researchers studied 10224 men and 3120 women for an 
average of more than eight years of those 240 men and 43 women 
died during the study it was a far larger study than previous ones 
of which the authors are aware they said 
the subjects were first tested on a treadmill to determine their 
fitness level and then tested for bloodcholesterol levels blood 
pressure and other general health factors 
they also were questioned about factors in their lifestyles that 
might affect longevity such as smoking as well as family history 
of heart disease 
even when all other data were considered the more active groups 
had lower death rates the authors said 
among men who were the least fit the death rate was 64 per 
10000 personyears compared with 166 deaths among the most fit 
group a personyear equals the number of people studied multiplied 
by the number of years they were followed 
among women deaths dropped from 395 per 10000 personyears to 
85 per 10000 
heartdisease death rates among men fell from 246 among the 
least fit to 31 for those in the two most fit groups for women 
heartdisease death rates dropped from 74 to 08 
death rates from cancer among men fell from 203 to 47 and 
among women dropped from 163 to 10 
researchers said that there were few deaths for the specific 
causes in women so those results should be interpreted cautiously 
we find that most of the reduction in this allcause mortality 
was due to lower rates in cardiovascular disease death and cancer 
death in the men and women blair said so it seems that higher 
levels of fitness are more likely to protect against those two 
causes of death 
the study also suggested that increased fitness may help 
compensate for other factors that might shorten life blair said 
for example people in the study who had high blood pressure but 
were highly fit lived longer than people with low blood pressure 
who were inactive

the chrysler corp agrees to pay 45350 in 
fines and work toward reducing medical disorders that result from 
repetitive motions performed by workers at its assembly plants the 
labor department says 
the agreement among chrysler the united auto workers union and 
the labor department was announced thursday 
the medical problems at issue are called cumulative trauma 
disorders though going by various names they all originate in 
constantly repeated motions 
perhaps the best known is carpal tunnel syndrome wrist pain 
found among people who must use typewriter keyboards 
another is white finger common among operators of pneumatic 
drills caused by vibration 
ergonomic hazards pose a particular threat in auto assembly 
operations because of the nature of much of the work the chrysler 
agreement is another important step in the agencys continuing 
commitment to cut the incidence of cumulative trauma disorders 
said gerard f scannell assistant secretary of labor and head of 
the departments occupational safety and health administration 
the agreement is modeled on an earlier agreement with iowa beef 
processors a company in another industry where tasks are broken 
down into small segments performed over and over like on an auto 
assembly line 
under the chrysler agreement the company has agreed to pay 
43000 to settle 13 allegations of workplace violations related to 
cumulative trauma disorders at its belvidere ill assembly plant 
the safety agency had proposed a fine of 65000 
another 2350 will be paid to settle other allegations for 
which the agency proposed fines of 13000 
under the agreement chrysler will hire an expert within 90 days 
to study the belvidere plant and help develop countermeasures 
against cumulative trauma disorders the study is to be completed 
within two years and reported to the agency 
the company will implement to the extent feasible the various 
controls necessary according to the departments announcement 
the belvidere plant will report periodically to the four other 
plants and chrysler agreed to use its best efforts to apply 
the belvidere controls at those installation an assembly plant in 
newark del the jeep plant in toledo ohio and two plants in st 
louis if separate hazards are identified at those plants chrysler 
has agreed to address those within three years 
chrysler also agreed not to discriminate against employees 
requesting medical treatment for a diagnosed cumulative trauma 
disorder 
measures that can be employed to prevent repetitive motion 
disorders can include among other things assignment of workers to 
do several task instead of just one rotation of workers among 
several jobs redesign of job tasks and special tools 
there was no indication of why the five plants were chosen and 
not others 
uaw local 1268 at belvidere is also a party to the agreement

health and human services secretary louis 
sullivan says he agrees federal funds should not be used for 
research using fetal tissue from intentional abortions 
sullivan acting on the recommendation of his chief health 
official informed the national institutes of health on thursday 
that the 20month ban on such research by federal scientists or 
with federal grants will be extended indefinitely 
while acknowledging potential health benefits from such 
research sullivan said he could not ignore the moral and ethical 
considerations 
it is clear that research involving use of fetal tissue from 
induced abortions for human transplantation could potentially 
produce health benefits and i do not in any way discount the 
importance of this fact sullivan said in a statement issued by 
his office 
but this is an issue which requires careful consideration not 
only of the potential benefits and hazard of such research but 
also profound consideration of those moral and ethical elements 
which must never be divorced from the highest purpose of medical 
research he said 
it is my conclusion that in the specific area of 
transplantation to humans involving fetal tissue from induced 
abortions it is not appropriate that federal support be provided 
james mason assistant secretary for health at hhs told 
reporters wednesday that he intended to continue the ban imposed 
by his predecessor last year because he believes such 
experimentation would lead to more abortions 
mason called federally supported fetal tissue research 
unacceptable public policy and said it would unfairly trade off 
the rights of fetuses with those of patients suffering from 
diseases that could possibly be treated by fetal tissue transplants 
medical experts ethicists and some lawmakers reacted strongly 
to masons decision saying it would hamper research into promising 
treatments for parkinsons disease and other as yet incurable 
conditions 
the ban applies to research using tissue from fetuses 
intentionally aborted it does not affect privately funded research 
using this tissue and would still allow federally funded research 
using fetal tissue obtained from spontaneous abortions

a spreading complacency about the aids 
epidemic threatens to undermine efforts to fight the disease that 
is expected to grow tenfold by the turn of the century a world 
health organization official warns 
jonathan m mann director of whos global programme on aids 
said the number of aids cases worldwide is expected to grow from 
the currently estimated 600000 to 6 million during the next decade 
the number infected with hiv the virus that causes aids but 
often lies dormant for years before symptoms appear is estimated 
at between 6 million and 8 million worldwide and is projected to 
double or triple during the 1990s he told the national commission 
on aids 
he said a successful foundation for fighting the epidemic has 
been built around strategies to slow the spread of the virus and 
the development of treatment therapies 
however he cautioned dangerous complacency about aids is 
spreading 
if complacency indifference or denial lead to relaxation of 
current efforts or to a decrease in future commitment to aids we 
will falter and fall further and further behind the pace of the 
worldwide epidemic he said 
mann called for increased financial and political commitments by 
the united states to the global programme on aids which helps 
countries set up national aids education and prevention programs 
the us contribution to the who program was 255 million in 
1989 about 30 percent of the programs budget he said mann said 
he anticipated the us contribution would be 21 million in 1990 
funding 20 percent of the budget 
he said the united states could help most by increasing its 
direct financial support of aids programs in other countries but 
he did not suggest how much 
manns testimony began a twoday meeting of the commission that 
was established last year to advise the president and congress on 
aids issues his estimate of 6 million aids cases by the year 2000 
is approximately the same as the agencys projection issued in may

congressional investigators and relatives of 
people killed in the pan am flight 103 bombing are going to west 
germany to look into new allegations of prior warnings that 
terrorists targeted the flight for attack 
a presidential commission also will look into the charges made 
in court documents by pan american world airways said sens frank 
lautenberg dnj and alfonse damato rny both members of 
the commission on aviation security 
rep cardiss collins dill at a news conference thursday with 
the senators and victims relatives said members of her staff will 
travel to bonn and frankfurt with relatives of some of the 270 
people killed in the dec 21 terrorist bombing over lockerbie 
scotland 
she said staff members would meet with german officials federal 
aviation administration security personnel in europe and airport 
security officers in frankfurt where the flight originated 
the flight crowded with americans returning to the united 
states for the christmas holidays went from frankfurt to london 
where passengers switched to another plane for the final leg to new 
york 
bert ammerman spokesman for victims families said the 
government showed negligent disregard for airport and airline 
security and terrorism and a lax response to the bombing 
the sevenmember commission on air terrorism will look into pan 
ams allegations that the israeli intelligence agency mossad warned 
us authorities of a possible attack 36 hours before the crash 
said lautenberg and damato 
they said the commission also will investigate pan ams 
contention that west germanys investigative agency reported 
suspicious activities at the frankfurt airport baggage loading 
area within 90 minutes of the flights departure 
the commission which includes members of congress and others 
was formed to look into the bombing 
lautenberg said he had no information to verify or disprove the 
new allegations the airline facing 300 million in lawsuits over 
the bombing wants a court order for documents and interviews at 
the cia and other us agencies along with any information the 
government may have about warnings before the flight 
a state department spokesman richard boucher said wednesday 
the department never received any specific and credible threat 
against pan am 103 british and us authorities have however 
acknowledged general threats against us carriers at the time 
west german authorities said they issued a general warning about 
possible terrorist attacks the month before the bombing but denied 
there were late warnings about the specific flight 
ammerman of river vale nj whose brother tom died in the 
bombing said relatives were shocked by the pan am claims 
needless to say these reports are appalling ammerman said 
if they are true then we could be witnessing the uncovering of 
one of the gravest scandals ever to hit our intelligence and 
security communities 
if they are not true he said then they would represent a 
cynical and reprehensible attempt by pan am to avoid culpability 
for this horrendous tragedy 
ammerman said that with both the government and the airline 
there has been too much fiddling going on while the families of 
the victims burn in our anguish and outrage 
investigators have determined the plane was downed by plastic 
explosives concealed in a radiocassette player in the luggage 
compartment the probe is focusing on terrorist groups operating in 
the middle east and europe but investigators have not determined 
who put it there

united airlines 232 northwest airlines 
255 pan am 103 these unfortunate flight numbers exist no longer 
pulled by airline officials leery of reminding their passengers of 
bad news 
united airlines still has early afternoon flights from denver to 
chicago but neither one is flight 232 the number given to a dc10 
that made a crash landing in sioux city last summer and northwest 
airlines doesnt operate a flight 255 in the wake of a crash two 
years ago 
theres no set policy said northwest spokesman bob gibbons 
in a telephone interview from minneapolis before flight 255 he 
said we hadnt had a crash in 23 years so its difficult to 
have a policy we elected to retire that number in this case 
flight 255 crashed just after takeoff at the detroit airport 
aug 16 1987 killing 156 passengers one child survived 
united spokeswoman sara dornacker said her company pulled the 
number after the july 19 crash landing of flight 232 which killed 
112 of the 296 people aboard 
there were some indications that customers didnt want to be 
reminded about flight 232 ms dornacker said from company 
headquarters in chicago 
pan am changed the number of flight 103 after a bomb destroyed 
the plane on dec 21 over lockerbie scotland killing all 259 
people on board and 11 on the ground the flight from frankfurt 
west germany is now flight 11 airline spokeswoman elizabeth 
manners said from new york 
united also changed the designation of its flight from honolulu 
to auckland new zealand and on to sydney australia on feb 24 
a large piece of the skin tore off of flight 811 creating a hole 
in the boeing 747 through which nine passengers were sucked to 
their deaths 
the new flight number is 817 
the designation of flight numbers ms dornacker said is 
basically up to the airline although federal regulations require 
airlines to keep distinctively different numbers any time two 
carriers serve the same market at about the same time this is to 
avoid confusion in communications between pilots and air traffic 
controllers 
while some airlines retire flight numbers for flights that 
resulted in crashes they have no qualms about using numbers 
involved in other airlines accidents united has a flight 255 and 
northwest has a flight 232 
our flight 255 serves a completely different market from 
miami to denver to sacramento calif ms dornacker said

the senate judiciary committee has passed a 
bill providing a temporary stay of deportations of salvadorans and 
nicaraguans who are in this country illegally after fleeing 
conflict in their home countries 
the measure won committee approval 113 thursday and now goes

provide a threeyear stay of deportations of chinese in the united 
states after fleeing the crackdown this summer against student 
democracy demonstrations 
that measure was sent to a subcommittee for further study 
the bill approved by the full panel contains no provision for 
staying deportations of chinese 
sen dennis deconcini dariz sponsor of the bill said it was 
needed to provide safe haven for citizens of the two central

witnesses have told congress that mikhail s

human rights abuses in the soviet union 
all of the witnesses who appeared thursday before a house 
foreign affairs subcommittee acknowledged that significant and 
unanticipated human rights advances have taken place under the 
leadership of the soviet president 
but all said the new freedoms of glasnost have been incomplete 
and halting 
its a case of two steps forward one step back and every 
days newspaper is evidence of that said holly burkhalter 
washington director of helsinki watch the observer group that 
monitors human rights developments in the soviet union 
rep wayne owens dutah and the subcommittees chairman 
outlined the more positive developments in the soviet union 
including the expansion of legitimate private enterprise broadened 
religious rights a more independent press greater freedom of 
expression a less oppressive kgb psychiatric reforms and a 
dramatic increase in emigration 
but owens and the witnesses said the silver cloud has a dark 
lining 
paradoxically glasnost has sometimes led to increased human 
rights abuses as the authorities have countered with new types of 
repression including the killing of peaceful demonstrators ms 
burkhalter said 
she said that while 600 or so longtime political prisoners have 
been released since 1987 at least 100 prisoners of conscience 
remain imprisoned 
soviet authorities have increased shortterm detentions holding 
as many as 150 people a month for up to 15 days she said 
and although the gorbachev government has taken important steps 
to curb the use of psychiatry to control political dissenters 
about 50 people continue to be held in psychiatric institutions for 
political reasons she said

a panel of the national academy of sciences 
warned today against proceeding with oil exploration off the 
california and florida coasts saying there is not enough reliable 
technical information on potential damage to the environment 
the scientific panel also was critical of past environmental 
studies of the lease sites by the interior department saying that 
in some cases potentially adverse economic and social problems from 
oil development were ignored 
at each of the three sites the panel said it found inadequate 
and unreliable technical and scientific data to warrant going ahead 
with lease sales 
the conclusions were presented to a presidential task force that 
is reviewing whether to issue oil and gas exploratory leases for 
the three offshore sites the task force is scheduled to make a 
recommendation to the white house by the end of the year 
the sites off northern and southern california and in the gulf 
of mexico near the florida everglades are among the most 
controversial government leases sought by the oil industry because 
of strong opposition from environmentalists and residents in nearby 
coastal areas 
last february president bush put a hold on issuing the leases 
and directed a special task force headed by interior secretary 
manuel lujan to examine the environmental concerns he also 
directed the academys national research council to examine the 
technical and scientific issues involved and make a report to the 
task force 
in its report the scientific panel concluded that the available 
technical and scientific data from each of the three lease sites 
is currently inadequate for decisions to be made about 
development and production of oil and gas resources 
the panel which included experts in marine science 
oceanography and environmental science did not specifically 
recommend against future development of the three sites but 
concluded no such decision should be made without further studies 
the leases involve potential oil and gas drilling on 11 million 
acres of ocean off southern california another 67 million acres 
off northern california and 14 million acres in the gulf of mexico 
near the florida everglades 
environmentalists have long argued that the three areas should 
be closed to oil drilling because a spill could cause serious harm 
to sensitive ecosystems nearby residents along nearby coastal 
areas also have strongly opposed the leases saying oil development 
could harm the scenery and affect tourism 
among the findings of the scientific panel were these 
an oil spill in the florida lease site likely would result in 
oil reaching the florida coastline within hours and polluting some 
of the states beaches 
more information is needed to assess the effect of oil 
development on corals seagrasses and other elements of the coastal 
ecosystems near the florida site although better information is 
available at the two california sites further studies on potential 
ecosystem damage is needed there as well 
data from interior department studies on the effect of oil 
development on nearby communities was found to be unreliable and 
not adequate to making a leasing decision the panel said in 
some cases information was out of date and at other times 
significant social and economic impacts to communities have 
been ignored 
in florida the threats posed by oil development to tourism 
have not even been studied said the panel while in southern 
california the question of community impact also has yet to be 
fully addressed 
in examining the impact of oil development at the sites for each 
of three categories ecology physical oceanography and 
socioeconomics the panel said it found shortcomings in one or 
more categories at each of the three sites

the giant dipper will roll again 
the wooden roller coaster many recall when thinking of this 
seaside resort will reopen this weekend to raise money for quake 
victims 
we want to help people have a little bit of fun after all 
thats happened here said ann t parker publicity manager for 
santa cruz seaside co which operates the santa cruz boardwalk 
and at the same time we want to raise money for people who really 
need it 
visitors to the boardwalk between noon and 5 pm saturday and 
sunday will be able to ride the giant dipper and other attractions 
as often as they want for 5 said parker proceeds go to the santa 
cruz county red cross and salvation army 
compared to what happened in downtown we really fared very 
well she said all the rides except for three kiddie rides 
that suffered minor damage are perfectly fine 
parker was in the companys mustardyellow complex facing the 
pacific ocean when the 71magnitude quake struck oct 17 tossing 
equipment to the floor and chasing terrified workers outside 
after determining no one was hurt she ran down the boardwalk to 
check the giant dipper a towering twisting whiteframed coaster 
circa 1924 thats listed on the national register of historic 
places 
the second thing she checked was another landmark the carousel 
built for 18000 in 1911 by woodcarver charles id looff 
ive had a lot of calls from all over the country from people 
who were wondering if the roller coaster was still here said 
parker well it is and im going to be one of the first to ride 
it this weekend 
more than 35 million people have ridden the classic twister 
which features speeds up to 55 mph 
although not the fastest or most thrilling the giant dipper is 
a favorite of coaster fans nationwide she said 
more than 20 rides weathered the quake and engineers and 
mechanics have declared all but three safe but the complexs 
indoor miniature golf course was damaged the quake shattered the 
buildings twostory glass panes and ripped the structures sides 
sending plaster and wood flying 
arcade machines and merchandise and equipment inside shops and 
restaurants were destroyed the quake opened cracks in the concrete 
covering the original wooden boardwalk built in 1907 
and the outdoor concrete bandstand where miss california was 
crowned in 1924 was destroyed when its concrete pillars pushed up 
through the platform 
its a good thing the quake didnt happen the sunday before 
ms parker said we had about 10000 people out here for the 
brussels sprouts festival and the platters were playing up on that 
stage 
because the park is only open weekends during the winter it was 
closed when the quake hit 
the boardwalk which has some 25 million visitors annually was 
abandoned one recent weekday except for workers making final 
mechanical checks on the giant dippers yellow cars and slapping 
plaster into cracks 
shops displaying bikinis and tshirts and eateries advertising 
pizza and hotdogs were closed the only thing moving indoors was a 
taffy machine at marinis fine candy pulling and twisting white 
goop for saltwater taffy

a popular television entertainer 
who jumped into the presidential race just two days ago has quickly 
emerged as frontrunner with nearly 30 percent of the vote 
according to a new poll 
silvio santos a conservative declared himself a candidate for 
the nov 15 election on the ticket of the small brazilian 
municipalist party he is a former street vendor who has strong 
support among the poor even though he is now a millionaire 
businessman 
a poll by the gallup institute which was published thursday by 
the newspaper o estado de sao paulo gave santos 29 percent of the 
vote a wide lead 
the newspaper said support for centerright candidate fernando 
collor de mello who had led the polls for six months had plunged 
from 293 percent to 186 percent among those questioned 
the nationwide poll was conducted between oct 26 and wednesday 
with people interviewed at random in the street and their homes 
the margin of error was 3 percent 
some 82 million brazilians are to choose a successor to 
president jose sarney for a fiveyear term the first popular vote 
for president since 1960 if no candidate wins a majority nov 15 
the two top votegetters will face each other in a runoff in 
december 
santos entrance into the race was criticized by left and 
rightwing candidates who agreed sarney was behind the maneuver 
sarney by law cannot run for reelection 
santos candidacy still faces legal challenges before it can be 
registered with the supreme electoral court 
accusations have been made that santos a tv entertainer who 
owns more than 30 businesses paid off former municipalist party 
candidate armando correa to resign 
the court must also decide if santos violated a law that 
requires corporate directors to step down from their positions 
three months before declaring their candidacy 
santos who runs the sbt television network the nations second 
largest says he is a shareholder and not a director in the 
company and thus exempt from the law 
collor de mello whose base of support is with the rural poor 
was hardest hit by santos candidacy but other major candidates 
saw their support fall as well according to the poll 
rep luis inacio lula da silva of the socialist workers party 
came in third with the support of 106 percent of those questioned 
down from 124 percent in the last poll 
leftwing populist leonel brizola a former governor was 
fourth receiving 99 percent a drop of 28 percent 
mario covas of the brazilian social democratic party was fifth 
with 8 percent support down slightly from 82 percent in last 
weeks poll 
eight percent of those questioned were unsure who they would 
vote for and 56 percent said they would cast blank ballots 
gallup conducted a simultaneous poll that excluded santos from 
the presidential contenders 
without santos in the race 275 percent of those questioned 
favored collor de mello followed by da silva at 138 percent 
brizola with 127 percent and covas at 106 percent

the indictment of 12 people in the united states 
and colombia offers the first clear indication of cooperation 
between the sicilian mafia and colombias medellin cartel federal 
officials said 
john galatalo 44 the alleged middleman between the two 
smuggling groups was among the dozen indicted in miami new york 
detroit and colombia according to federal officials 
this is the first real hard evidence of this nexus and close 
relationship between colombian cocaine trafficking and sicilian 
mafia members timothy mcnally assistant special agent in charge 
of the fbi in miami said thursday 
the 12 are accused of shipping 30kilogram loads of cocaine by 
automobile and train from miami to philadelphia and new york 
between 1985 and 1987 in late 1987 galatalo allegedly arranged 
for a 600kilogram shipment to be routed through aruba to the 
mediterranean for distributon by the sicilian mafia in italy 
miami fbi spokesman paul miller said the ring purchased its 
cocaine from defendant angel leon sanchez 39 a member of the 
barranquilla cartel which is directly connected to colombias 
medellin cartel 
they opened a corridor from medellin to southern europe 
miller said 
sanchez is believed to be in colombia and the fbi will request 
his extradition 
three of the defendants one in miami and two in new york are 
in custody and several others are expected to turn themselves in 
today and tomorrow 
galatalo of miami was out on bond on a june indictment now 
superseded by the charges a federal grand jury handed up wednesday 
he was expected at a hearing in the new case today 
galatalo could face 10 years to life in prison if convicted of 
running a continuing criminal enterprise 
another defendant angelo fontana 36 of miami also was free on 
bond in the earlier case authorities said they expected his 
surrender 
the fbi praised italian police for their cooperation in the 
twoyear investigation and added that while the 34count 
indictment was unlikely to significantly reduce the cocaine supply 
it had hit highlevel traffickers 
were interested in major defendants major organizational 
players who put together this conspiracy and the shipments 
mcnally said in this indictment we think we have it 
the indictment says the italianborn galatalo arranged for 
colombian cocaine to be imported to miami then traveled to new 
york aruba and milan to make arrangements for shipments to the 
northeast and europe 
others named in the indictment are waldino jesus aponte ramero 
41 luis mejia 31 mariella liggo 49 and luis miguel 41 all of 
miami carrell williams 43 of detroit anthony corinella and his 
wife giovanna corinella 40 of sands point ny victor castro

the oldest dinosaur may have been shorter than 
former basketball star wilt chamberlain and lighter than football 
star william refrigerator perry 
it was puny for a dinosaur it scampered along on the toes of 
its rear feet but had large claws on its forelimbs used to grasp 
prey said university of chicago paleontologist paul sereno 
more importantly sereno and other scientists said thursday they 
believe the first drawing of the ancient herrerasaurus may reveal 
important clues into the evolution of dinosaurs 
before only a few bones of herrerasaurus were known said 
sereno now we have everything 
basically we have the first relatively complete idea of what 
the primitive form of the dinosaur looks like this will help us in 
trying to figure out the pathways of evolution that proceeded over 
the course of many millions of years after that 
scientists welcomed serenos work presented thursday in austin 
texas at meetings of the society of vertebrate paleontologists 
i think its extremely important to know what the thing looks 
like in detail said nicholas hotton curator of fossils 
amphibians and reptiles at the smithsonian national museum of 
natural history if youve got that kind of information you can 
tell which way evolution is going 
sereno said the artists reconstruction of the dinosaur named 
after an argentine goat herder was based largely on the recent 
discovery of a skull and two nearly complete skeletons in south 
america 
working with south american colleagues alfredo monetta and jose 
bonaparte sereno discovered the fossils in the foothills of the 
andes 
there is definitely a certain amount of good fortune in these 
things said sereno who last month won a 500000 packard 
foundation award that will allow him to continue work on the 
herrerasaurus and other research projects including a study of 
ancient birds 
the herrerasaurus which scampered the earth some 230 million 
years ago was earths first true dinosaur basically you go 
back further and you get dinosaurtype things but not a dinosaur 
he said 
herrerasaurus weighed a mere 300 pounds and stood between 6 feet 
and 8 feet tall sereno said the chicago bears perry weighs in at 
325 pounds while chamberlain stands 7 feet 1 inch high 
like all other dinosaurs herrerasaurus roamed the earth for 
only a few million years before becoming extinct scientists arent 
sure what doomed the tiny first dinosaur sereno said 
with the new representation of the animal we finally have 
some idea of the path of history he said

berdj karapetian a spokesman for the armenia national committee 
they are killing our people there armenian immigrant edward

a yugoslavian freighter that carved a 500foot 
swath through a delicate coral shoal monday off the florida keys 
has been refloated without any leaking or pollution the coast 
guard said 
tugboats pulled the 475foot mavro vetranic free on a rising 
tide at 904 pm thursday coast guard spokesman steve sapp said 
he did not know how many tugboats were involved 
the freighter ran aground on the sandy coralstudded shoal 
while carrying a cargo of granular fertilizer phosphate from tampa 
to hamburg west germany 
state officials estimate the grounding caused tens of millions 
of dollars damage to the reef in the dry tortugas islands about 60 
miles west of key west 
the tugboats pulled the ship free after emergency crews spent 
two days pumping 390 tons of fuel oil off the vessel onto a barge 
alongside sapp said the 14300ton phosphate cargo was left 
aboard 
salvors raced to complete the maneuver ahead of an expected turn 
in the weather today authorities said the expected winds and high 
seas could have ruptured the ship threatening severe damage to the 
coral reef 
once the ship was free sapp said it was moved to safe 
anchorage in deeper water where the hull was surveyed for possible 
damage 
there was no leaking or pollution of any kind he said 
also on thursday coast guard capt henry d jacoby flew to key 
west to convene a factfinding board of inquiry to determine the 
cause of the grounding 
representatives of the us attorneys office earlier boarded 
the mavro vetranic as part of a federal investigation while the 
state planned to file its own lawsuit for reef damage in a state 
court today 
there is no conflict between us both filing said joe 
bizarro spokesman for the state attorney generals office there 
seems to be overlapping jurisdiction

a navy admiral says he stands by his 
conclusion that gunners mate clayton hartwig was the most likely 
person to have sabotaged the battleship iowa even as his report 
comes under attack on capitol hill 
its not a popular conclusion to come to certainly the 
hartwig family is doing all it can to defend the family name and 
their son rear adm richard milligan said in an interview 
thursday 
hartwigs family has said they do not believe the sailor could 
have taken his own life and those of 46 colleagues in the fiery 
april 19 blast aboard the world war iiera battleship 
hartwig told his parents in a letter written jan 25 that a 
water pipe on the uss iowa blew open from the force of a blast of a 
16inch gun on turret 2 the previous day the washington times 
reported in todays editions that is the same turret that exploded 
april 19 
the times said it obtained the letter from hartwigs sister 
kathy kubicina of cleveland she was quoted as saying it was not 
included in the correspondence she turned over to naval 
investigative service agents 
lt bruce cole a navy spokesman was quoted in the times as 
saying there have been no inappropriate firing events on board 
the iowa he said the rupture of pipes was not significant to the 
april explosion 
the daily press of newport news va reported thursday that one 
sailor killed in the blast jack e thompson jr had told family 
members there had been an accident involving a firing of one of the 
turrets guns in february 
at the pentagon navy spokesman rear adm brent baker said 
there was no accident back in february its not true 
several members of congress from ohio hartwigs home state 
have been outspokenly critical of the navys report 
and rep nicholas mavroules dmass chairman of a house armed 
services subcommittee that is reviewing the matter has said he 
seriously questioned the admirals conclusion that the blast 
probably was a willful act of sabotage 
the senate and house armed services committees plan to hold 
hearings while congress investigative arm the general accounting 
office has already begun an inquiry 
i welcome those investigations i have no fear of them 
the admiral said 
the 30year navy veteran who is now acting as the services 
chief budget official said he thinks the ultimate conclusion is 
going to be that they are going to support my investigation 
milligan issued the navys technical and criminal study on sept 
7 
at that time navy officials acknowledged that their evidence 
was circumstantial given the fact that all the witnesses including 
hartwig died in the explosion 
even though the report said it could not pinpoint the exact 
cause of the blast it said the explosion was most probably an 
intentional act and that hartwig was the most likely person with 
the access knowledge and possible motivation to accomplish it by 
inserting some type of detonator between the bags of gunpowder in 
one of the ships 16inch guns 
the admiral said the navy at the suggestion of the fbi has 
conducted additional tests on the material found inside the 
battleships 16inch gun 
milligan said that while he could not give the outcome because 
the report is being studied by his superiors he is familiar with 
the findings 
i am not aware of anything that would cause me to change my 
report after 3 months he said we will come up with 
nothing that will change the findings of fact opinions or 
recommendations that i had before 
mavroules cited an fbi report that said its laboratory 
investigation on the matter was inconclusive and its technicians 
could not find evidence of the unspecified foreign material in 
the gun barrel that the navy said it found 
i have evidence my report says i have evidence milligan 
said of such criticism 
he argued that his investigation must be looked at in its 
entirety including more than 20000 technical tests done on 
gunpowder multiple recreations of the explosion and the hundreds 
of interviews with the ships crew and their acquaintances 
milligan said that while he found problems on the ship regarding 
the training of the crew the use of unauthorized gunpowder and 
powder loads and other technical issues those deficiencies did 
not cause the accident 
in the report the navy said it found hartwig to be a loner 
who had few friends and who was upset about the breakup of a 
friendship with another sailor 
milligan said that when hartwigs sister wrote the navy 
complaining that her brother had taken out an insurance policy 
naming another sailor as the sole beneficiary a criminal probe by 
the naval investigative service had to be opened 
im convinced the nis did a very professional investigation 
he said 
the admiral asked about the fact that some have questioned why 
the navy came up with different conclusions than the fbi did in its 
laboratory studies said the navy tested much more extensively 
than the fbi timewise equipmentwise

mayor w wilson goode remained hospitalized 
today after complaining of a rapid heartbeat for the third time in 
the last two weeks 
we believe it is an innocent type of heart irregularity which 
can be seen in individuals with normal hearts his physician 
edward s cooper said late thursday the mayor is fine hes 
doing just fine 
the 51yearold goode who has been mayor since 1983 entered 
university of pennsylvania hospital about 2 am thursday after 
suffering an irregular heartbeat that lasted about a minute or two 
about midnight wednesday cooper said 
a third incident of rapid heartbeat occurred for 30 seconds 
about 5 am thursday while goode was hospitalized 
goode was out of bed thursday reading newspapers watching 
television and talking with to city officials on the telephone 
cooper said the mayor was expected to stay in the hospital until 
saturday 
we are using this time in the hospital for further heart 
monitoring in the event that the episode recurs and also we will 
be obtaining other miscellaneous studies in order to detect the 
underlying triggering process cooper said 
goode was taken to the hospital oct 20 after complaining of 
head and neck pain his heart rate and blood pressure were high 
when he arrived at the emergency room and he underwent tests 
doctors performed a cardiac catheterization which they termed 
the definitive test of goodes heart and cardiac arteries dr 
arthur whereat said tests showed the mayor had a perfectly normal 
heart 
goode was discharged from the hospital the next day whereat 
attributed his symptoms to sinus problems 
doctors also said that simple stress from overwork might be to 
blame 
i cant say whether his 16hour days are beginning to take a 
toll cooper said that certainly is a possibility as we 
all get older maybe we cant take it maybe we have to be 
satisfied with a 10 to 12hour day

coal strikes spread in the arctic mining region 
with 18000 workers staying off their jobs to demand better living 
and working conditions labor leaders said today 
but strike leaders in the nations no 1 coalproducing region 
the donetsk basin in the ukraine decided to keep working until 
their demands are considered by soviet lawmakers a strike 
committee member said on condition of anonymity 
in the arctics vorkuta region about 18000 workers at 12 of 13 
mines were on strike strike committee member sergei nosovoy said 
about 100 miles away in inta about 10000 miners were voting 
whether to join the walkout strike organizer yaroslav chaban said 
in a telephone interview 
soviet officials warn that a drop in coal production could force 
the rationing of heating and light as the long severe russian 
winter begins 
miners in vorkuta and donetsk are demanding that the government 
deliver the benefits that were promised during a wave of strikes 
last summer the promised benefits included improved living and 
working conditions more economic autonomy for the mining regions 
and official recognition of strike committees 
strikers say that while members of the government report the 
fulfillment of some of the points of the resolution things remain 
unchanged in the mining areas the official news agency tass said 
thursday 
at the komsomolskaya mine in vorkuta miners were still working 
but were preventing coal from being shipped outside vorkuta the 
newspaper komsomolskaya pravda said thursday 
we do not expect any special privileges nor are we depriving 
other regions of food goods or money the miners said in a 
statement quoted by the newspaper all we are asking is that the 
government the coal ministry and the union leadership should keep 
their word 
in a separate article the newspaper painted a stark 
sympathetic picture of a miners lot in the soviet arctic noting 
many do not see daylight for months 
the miners lunchbox contains some bread a wedge of cheese 
and some sausage named dogs delight the mines are cold dark 
very humid and filled with coal dust the paper said unlike 
most of the countries that set a 15 or 10year limit for working 
underground retirement age for miners has been fixed at 50 
a regional court in vorkuta has ruled that the miners walkout 
is unlawful but authorities have not tried to make people return 
to their jobs by force the miners say they will appeal the courts 
decision in the supreme soviet legislature 
the legislature passed a law last month legalizing strikes in 
some industries but banning them in such crucial sectors as energy 
defense and transport

prodemocracy movement have begun questioning beijing university 
students on campus about their activities at the time of the 
protests university sources said today 
in hong kong an independent newspaper reported that chinese 
authorities have complied a new wanted list of dissidents it 
reportedly includes chai ling a key figure in the protests as 
well as other students and intellectuals 
at beijing university students were told at several officially 
sponsored rallies this week that they should cooperate with 
investigators who would come to question them said the sources 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
an official of the universitys foreign affairs office today 
denied that any such rallies had taken place or that investigators 
had come onto campus 
beijing university students were at the forefront of the mass 
protests that were crushed when the chinese army shot through 
crowds of unarmed demonstrators in the capital leaving hundreds 
and possibly thousands dead 
thousands more were arrested including beijing university 
freshman wang dan one of the driving forces behind the students 
occupation of beijings tiananmen square 
beijing university is considered chinas most prestigious and 
politically active school 
the crackdown on the protest movement has increased tension on 
campus this year some upperclassmen did not return after summer 
break apparently either because they were arrested or feared they 
would be 
there also are no freshmen on campus this year the entering 
class was slashed from 2100 to 800 then shipped off for a year of 
army training and political indoctrination at a military academy 
southwest of beijing 
classes at the university originally scheduled to begin aug 
29 were delayed until oct 14 to avoid unrest on oct 1 or 
national day which marks the 40th anniversary of communist china 
students said 
hao bin the communist party vice secretary at the university 
summoned students in groups to hourlong rallies this week at the 
campus 2000seat auditorium the university sources said 
he told them to cooperate with investigators and urged them to 
confess if they had done any significant bad things said one 
university source 
hao a hardliner believed to have served as a political officer 
with the peoples liberation army was quoted as telling students 
there were several types of people who must turn themselves in 
they included leaders of student organizations involved in the 
protests and those who attacked soldiers spread rumors to 
foreigners or divulged secrets the source said 
one student was questioned about a contribution of more than 
2500 to the student movement from workers at a government 
ministry another source at the university said 
in hong kong the independent chineselanguage ming pao 
newspaper printed a copy of what it described as an official list 
of seven wanted dissidents put out last month by the ministry of 
public security 
such a document suggests that the dissidents were still at large 
among the three most prominent student leaders of the tiananmen 
square demonstrations chai is the only one whose fate has remained 
since the crackdown began 
one leader wuer kaixi fled to the west the third was wang 
the freshman who was captured by chinese authorities in beijing 
chai a 23yearold native of shandong province who was a 
graduate student in the department of psychology at beijing normal 
university assumed the title of commander of the headquarters to 
defend tiananmen square before the crackdown

hitler and all us presidents from franklin roosevelt to ronald 
reagan the station said

foreign sanctions imposed on 
south africa have cost the country 500000 jobs and billions of 
dollars since 1985 a leading economist says 
the study released thursday by chris van wyk chief executive of 
the bankorp banking group also said foreign investment and trade 
bans have hurt blacks the most 
the harshest burden of sanctions has fallen on them he 
said adding that 80 percent of new jobseekers are black 
a continuation of existing trade and financial sanctions 
throughout the 1990s would render a million more black people 
jobless and 2 million more financially destitute said van wyk 
whose study was described by financial writers as the most 
definitive attempt yet to quantify the impact of sanctions 
the study said sanctions and the pullout of foreign investment 
since 1985 cost 16 billion in foreign exchange resulting in 
production losses of about 32 billion and total spending loss of 
about 45 billion based on the average value of the countrys 
currency the rand during that period 
sanctions have impaired south africas ability to reach its full 
export potential and had radicalized many young blacks to the 
left and many white voters to the right van wyk said the 
moderate center has been weakened making a political settlement 
much more difficult 
despite the sanctions south africas economy still is 
considered the strongest and most diversified on the continent 
van wyk said the overall economic impact was similar to what 
south africa would have experienced had the price of gold its 
major export averaged 200 an ounce instead of 400 over the past 
five years 
interest rates and inflation have been higher the rand weaker 
wages lower and growth employment and spending levels much lower 
than they would have been without sanctions he said 
there were some positive spinoffs from sanctions he said 
economic considerations began to assume their rightful place in 
government decisionmaking along with commitment to concepts 
such as tax reform and privatization 
since 1985 several hundred foreign companies have pulled out of 
south africa generally citing either financial concerns or 
pressure from antiapartheid groups 
in the same period most western countries have imposed some 
type of trade sanctions on south africa affecting exports of major 
products such as coal and steel even though some new markets have 
been found in the far east 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

life rafts and their whereabouts were unknown said center chief 
capt jaffar lamri 
a royal malaysian navy patrol craft and two helicopters from the 
royal malaysian air force mounted a search said lamri quoted by

foreign minister pik botha 
acknowledged today that his allegations of an incursion by black 
nationalist guerrillas into namibia may have been based on fake 
radio broadcasts 
however botha said he was not embarrassed to have made the 
charges even if the messages were the work of a crackpot 
botha claimed he was simply trying to avert conflict prior to 
the nov 711 elections that are to lead namibia a south african 
colony into independence 
if these transmission are a hoax i would be the first to be 
overjoyed botha said in a statement today at least it has had 
the result that everybody has been sensitized to the need to 
curtail violence or intimidation 
south africa which has ruled namibia for 74 years fought a 
23year war in the territory against the guerrillas of the 
southwest africa peoples organization south africa signed a 
regional peace accord last year under which it has agreed to grant 
the territory independence with un supervision 
botha announced wednesday that south africa had placed its 
troops on alert and was prepared to delay the elections due to an 
alleged incursion by namibian guerrillas he said members of the 
un monitoring force reported in internal radio traffic the 
infiltration of 600 guerrillas from oct 2631 
however fred eckhard a spokesman for the un peacekeeping 
troops in namibia said thursday the messages are phony in 
content and format 
south african military technicians investigating the matter 
found the radio traffic was sent on frequencies allocated to the 
un monitoring group botha said 
however bothas statement provided no evidence that it was un 
personnel who sent the messages 
whether it was a crackpot or un officials is to me not the 
important issue he said my purpose is to avoid bloodshed 
un soldiers and territorial police regularly patrol the border 
area and have not reported any incursions a reconnaissance team of 
south africans angolans and un personnel also is searching the 
border by helicopter botha said 
the angolanamibia border stretches for several hundred miles of 
thinly populated scrub brush many civilians cross each way daily 
ignoring the few isolated border posts 
the guerrillas and angolan officials have denied that any 
guerrillas are massing on the angolanamibia border or have crossed 
into namibia 
the us state department said thursday it had no independent 
information to confirm the south african allegations 
the southwest africa peoples organization is widely favored to 
win next weeks elections and run namibias first independent 
government

a leader of irans hardline 
conservatives ali akbar mohtashemi today denied reports of a 
power struggle in irans leadership and said it is united in its 
antiamerican policies 
in an interview with the islamic republic news agency the 
former interior minister said reports of fighting between 
hardliners and pragmatists who favor closer ties with the west 
were totally erroneous 
conservative or extremist in the western sense of the words 
are just alien expressions to islam and when a common enemy is 
concerned a moslem has just one single outlook he told the news 
agency in an interview monitored in nicosia 
mohtashemi was dropped from the new government of the president 
hashemi rafsanjani 
in a news conference in tehran last week rafsanjani said there 
was a difference in thinking among the iranian leadership 
rafsanani elected in july dropped many leading radicals from 
his government in favor of better qualified often westerneducated 
technocrats 
while the radicals eschew any relations with the west 
especially the united states the pragmatists are believed to want 
to change irans radical image and end its isolation to help obtain 
economic assistance 
mohtashemis interview came on the eve of the anniversary of the 
takeover of the us embassy in tehran on november 4 1979 the 
anniversary is to be celebrated before the former embassy compound 
where a bonfire will be made of 160 american flags irna 
reported 
the 160 flags will honor 16 kuwaiti shiites beheaded in saudi 
arabia in september for planting bombs in mecca during the annual 
moslem pilgrimage to that city 
saudi television aired what it said were confessions of the 
kuwaiti shiites in which they said they were trained by iran 
iran said the confessions were baseless and denounced the 
beheadings as an american plot 
rafsanjani has tried to play down the anniversary of the embassy 
takeover at his news conference he did not show much enthusiasm 
for the occasion and said that usually we do celebrate such 
events but it all depends on the spirits of the people 
iranians interviewed on the streets of tehran have also shied 
away from talking about the event

a drug dealer caught at an airport was 
sentenced to life in prison without parole in what a federal judge 
said was the first application of a mandatory penalty congress 
approved last year 
that means you will have to stay in prison until you die 
us district judge elmo b hunter told james a mckines 38 of 
las vegas at the sentencing thursday 
mckines was convicted by a jury of trying to smuggle eight soft 
drink bottles filled with liquid phencyclidine the hallucinogen 
known on the street as pcp or angel dust through kansas city 
international airport on june 8 
mckines had two previous felony convictions for trafficking in 
pcp in nevada in 1981 and in california in 1986 
the antidrug abuse act of 1988 requires a mandatory sentence of 
life in prison without release for a third felony drug conviction 
hunter said it was the first time the law has been applied since it 
became effective 
mckines lawyer david l owen jr said he would appeal the 
sentence 
as mandated by congress this violates the constitutional 
protection against cruel and unusual punishment owen told the 
judge 
i thought about the constitutional aspects hunter replied 
i am satisfied that the statute is lawful i dont find anything 
cruel and unusual about it when compared to the damage drugs do to 
humanity the law does not begin to cause the sadness and damage 
that one man can do selling pcp or cocaine or crack 
mckines who has known since his conviction what his sentence 
could be showed no emotion when the sentence was pronounced 
i have nothing to say mckines told the judge i just want 
to thank my lawyers for trying to help me 
mckines was stopped by agent carl hicks of the federal drug 
enforcement administration during a routine surveillance of flights 
arriving from the west coast a major source of drugs sold in the 
midwest 
a jury convicted mckines on aug 28 of conspiring to possess 
with intent to distribute pcp possession of pcp with intent to 
distribute the drug and interstate travel in aid of racketeering

romania blocked final agreement on a 
35nation environmental accord today because it objected to a 
provision that would allow citizens to protest pollution diplomats 
said 
despite romanias objections however a us delegation source 
said the pact likely will be adopted by the other 34 nations 
meeting in the bulgarian capital 
the conference which began oct 16 has been considering 
measures that include how to deal with industrial accidents in 
border areas and treating dangerous chemical products that leak 
into international waterways 
but romania under hardline communist leader nicolae ceausescu 
refused to accept any reference to permitting citizens or 
unofficial groups to voice their concerns on ecological issues in a 
final conference document diplomats said 
bulgaria and the soviet union were said to have made lastditch 
efforts thursday to persuade romania to drop its objections 
this morning bulgarian leader todor zhivkov personally appealed 
to ceausescu by telephone to drop the romanian objections but 
failed the us source said speaking by telephone from sofia on 
condition of anonymity 
the sofia conference is being held as part of the process 
started by the 1975 helsinki final act signed by 35 nations 
including the united states canada the soviet union and all 
european nations except for albania 
romania has a history of blocking or diluting agreements reached 
by the 35 nations who signed the 1975 helsinki final act on 
security and cooperation in europe 
romanian objections blocked a final agreement on a document at a 
cultural symposium in budapest in 1985 
romania also marred a landmark agreement on human rights reached 
at a 35nation helsinki followup conference in vienna last january 
by announcing it would not feel bound by provisions on religious 
freedom and other human rights 
until the current conference in sofia bulgaria also had 
harrassed independent ecological groups and other emerging 
unofficial organizations 
but the presence of western officials attending the conference 
which opened oct 16 has allowed the independent group 
ecoglasnost and other dissenters a margin of public activity 
unknown before on sofia streets 
police intervened once with ecoglasnost activists 
arresting at least 22 of them as they collected signatures in a 
sofia park on a petition against a governmentbacked industrial 
project 
following strong complaints from western delegations about the 
incident the head of bulgarias delegation to the ecological 
conference nikolai dyulgerov said next day the police action was 
regrettable

about 4000 east germans were 
jammed into the west german embassy in prague today with new 
arrivals pouring in each hour all eager to emigrate west despite 
promises of reform from their communist leaders 
its just the same hardheaded idiots as before said a 
bricklayer from karlmarxstadt whats going to change the 
corrupted socialism in our country is just getting new clothes 
thats all 
i dont believe that anything will change there said 
another young man the reforms are only for the outside world 
red cross workers and refugees unloaed tents and bedding trucked 
in from west germany 
east germany has agreed to let its citizens here renounce their 
citizenship and then go to west germany where they are 
automatically granted citizenship 
but with east german diplomats processing only about 100 
applications a day it was feared the embassy and its gardens 
which have a capacity of about 5500 people would be overflowing 
by the weekend when a rush of new arrivals was expected 
embassy sources who put the number of east germans at about 
4000 just before noon said negotiations were under way with 
czechoslovak authorities for more space 
some people arriving today said the roads to prague were crammed 
with east german cars 
the wave began wednesday after east germanys new leader egon 
krenz lifted a monthold travel ban to czechoslovakia the only 
country east germans can visit freely krenzs predecessor erich 
honecker had imposed the ban to stop an earlier exodus of east 
germans to the west german embassy in prague 
the exodus has mainly involved skilled workers in their early 
20s and 30s at least 200 to 300 children played inside the embassy 
grounds 
those who have left east germany include at least 1100 doctors 
and nurses and this has severely strained health services in the 
communist country an east german health officials said today 
dr geerd dellas the health administrator for the city of east 
berlin said doctors and nurses from exclusive clinics serving 
highranking communist officials have been drafted to work in 
ordinary hospitals nurses still in school who were near graduation 
have also been employed dellas said 
east germans were swift to take advantage of the lifting of the 
travel ban eight thousand crossed into czechoslovakia in the first 
24 hours and the number in the west german embassy swelled from 
2100 thursday night to some 4000 by noon today 
youve just got to use an open barn door to the west while you 
can said one 25yearold from leipzig 
most refugees simply walked in through the giant wooden doors of 
the palais lobkowicz the elegant baroque palace that houses the 
west german embassy in pragues ancient mala strana district 
a czech policeman outside the embassy said he and his colleagues 
had orders not to interfere because it was a matter for the two 
germanys alone 
the west german government appealed to east germany to speed up 
the bureaucratic process for the east germans in prague and about 
700 still waiting at the west german mission in warsaw poland 
east germany said it was working as fast as possible and 
reiterated that it would be better for its citizens to apply for 
legal emigration 
east germans complain that it often takes years for a such 
requests to be granted 
since august more than 70000 east germans have fled their 
homeland through hungary and bonns embassies in prague and warsaw 
on oct 3 honecker banned travel to czechoslovakia to try to 
halt the exodus of young skilled workers badly needed in his 
laborintensive economy 
but the exodus and pressure for reform led to honeckers ouster 
oct 18 he was replaced by krenz who is trying to bolster the 
communist partys sagging authority with promises of reform and 
foreign travel 
krenz faces mounting pressure for democratic reform in east 
germany where tens of thousands have repeatedly taken to the 
streets to press for more democracy 
returning from poland on thursday krenz urged closer economic 
ties to the west several top communist officials resigned 
including honeckers wife margot as education minister

the superintendent of the prison wracked 
by two riots last week was suspended and will receive no salary 
until an investigation is complete officials said 
the suspension of superintendent robert m freeman will last 
until a threemember commission appointed by gov robert p casey 
makes its report in a month into the cause of the violence said

commissioners decision was related to information reported by the 
associated press about two hours before the suspension was first 
announced wednesday 
in interviews this week more than 15 correctional officers said 
the prison administration failed to heed warnings about 
lockcontrol panels broken during the first riot

prison was secured after the first riot in an attempt to play down 
the uprising prison officials said they stand by their accounts

before the riots quoting inmates who had warned about the coming 
trouble

judges and other court workers shut down 
the nations justice system today and said they would not return to 
work unless the government gives them more protection from drug 
traffickers 
medellin judges who began a strike a day earlier handed in 
their resignations today reported the colombian radio network rcn 
the resignations are viewed as largely symbolic gestures that are 
not likely to be carried out 
drug thugs who have waged a bloody campaign since a government 
crackdown began 11 weeks ago were blamed for a car bomb explosion 
thursday night in the capital of bogota three members of a family 
and a soldier were killed and two people were injured 
three other small bombs exploded in the capital and one was 
deactivated the police said in a communique 
the strike by 17000 members of the national association of 
court workers began thursday and was to last through wednesday it 
was sparked by the slaying of a federal judge in medellin on 
wednesday the third federal judge killed by drug traffickers in 
the last three months 
but this morning union leader helmut romero told the caracol 
radio network that the strike will go on indefinitely until the 
government gives protection to the courts 
the judges want bulletresistant cars and vests bodyguards 
guns weapons training and metal detectors at entrances to their 
offices 
this is the third strike by judges in the last three months but 
this is the first one where the courts have been closed down 
indefinitely 
the medellin judges resignations are symbolic to emphasize 
their demands judges have resigned in the past to bring attention 
to their problems and the resignations are not effective unless 
accepted by the supreme court 
in the past the resignations have been rejected and the judges 
have gone back to work after meeting with government officials 
representatives of the medellin judges were flying to bogota today 
to try to meet with president virgilio barco el tiempo said 
el tiempo also reported today that two court employees both 
union members were kidnapped in cali last saturday tortured and 
then shot to death a woman answering the telephone at the cali 
police department said the report was true but refused to give 
other details 
more than 180 bombings have rocked colombia since the government 
declared a crackdown on drug traffickers aug 19 the day after a 
leading presidential candidate was assassinated the terrorist 
campaign has left 25 people dead and another 224 injured 
authorities here assume the drug traffickers are using the 
bombings to try to force the government to abandon its policy of 
extraditing drug suspects to the united states five suspects have 
been extradited since the crackdown began 
in the last eight years 222 court workers including 43 judges 
have been killed most of them by drug traffickers 
federal judge mariela espinoza was killed wednesday by 
submachinegun fire from two speeding cars as she arrived at her 
medellin home with two guards on motorcycles one of the bodyguards 
and a bystander were wounded

the minnesota supreme court has agreed to 
review whether two twin cities newspapers must pay damages to a man 
for publishing his name after reporters promised him anonymity as a 
news source 
the court said thursday that it would hear oral arguments in 
former publicist dan cohens case against the st paul pioneer 
press dispatch and the star tribune of minneapolis after both sides 
have filed new briefs 
in september the minnesota court of appeals upheld a jurys 
award of 200000 in actual damages to cohen but threw out an 
award of 500000 in punitive damages 
the newspapers last month asked the state supreme court to throw 
out the actual damages cohen has asked the court to reinstate the 
punitive damages 
the case involves a 1982 incident in which cohen gave reporters 
copies of court documents showing that marlene johnson who was 
running for lieutenant governor had been convicted of shoplifting 
12 years earlier editors of the papers decided to name cohen as 
their source for the documents and cohen lost his job with an 
advertising agency 
johnsons conviction was vacated in 1971 with no sentence she 
was elected as gov rudy perpichs running mate and the two are 
seeking reelection next year

a rebel commander said today 
the guerrillas canceled peace talks because the government left no 
alternative but armed struggle after a union hall bombing killed 10 
people 
with the massacre the fascist dictatorship has been 
unmasked the only way being left open is the immediate taking up 
of arms said rebel commander eduardo sancho on rebel radio 
venceremos 
the farabundo marti national liberation front said thursday it 
had suspended our participation in peace talks rebel and 
government representatives were to meet nov 20 in caracas 
venezuela in a third round of talks that began in mexico in 
september 
the talks had produced virtually no progress toward ending a 
10yearold civil war that has killed an estimated 70000 people 
each side accused the other of bad faith 
the government had no comment early today on the suspension of 
the talks 
sancho said tuesdays bombing of the national federation of 
salvadoran workers was the principal reason for suspension of 
the talks he said the bombing marks a new line a new political 
moment similar to the early 1980s when rampant political 
violence was claiming up to 800 lives a month 
on thursday thousands of unionists buried their slain comrades 
and vowed revenge 
because the color of blood is never forgotten our slain 
companions will be avenged the unionists shouted as they marched 
through downtown 
many carried wreaths and banners denouncing president alfredo 
cristianis rightist government 
the rebels said they had evidence the bombing was the decision 
of military chief of staff col rene ponce was authorized by 
christiani and executed by col elena fuentes commander of the san 
salvadorbased 1st army brigade 
the rebels did not describe the nature of their evidence 
el salvador observed the day of the dead holiday thursday and 
no government spokesman was available to respond to the accusation 
the twoday holiday honors the deceased 
cristiani in an address tuesday night condemned the bombing as 
terrorism and pledged an investigation 
death to daubuisson chanted the marchers thursday 
referring to roberto daubuisson founder and honorary president of 
cristianis republican nationalist alliance or arena 
human rights advocates consider daubuisson the mastermind of 
rightist death squads that killed thousands of suspected leftists 
in the early 1980s 
the marchers some of whom wore bandanas covering their faces 
and carried nailstudded wooden staves plastered walls downtown 
with redbordered posters emblazoned with the initials of the 
guerrilla front 
for the future of our children everyone against arena 
said the poster 
soldiers and police generally stayed well away from the march 
route the only incident occurred when a truckload of army troops 
approached the rear of the march 
marchers taunted the troops with shouts and a soldier tossed a 
teargas grenade that left a few dozen demonstrators crying and 
coughing 
two rocketequipped air force helicopters flew over the march in 
rapid succession as it approached the bermeja cemetery on the 
citys southern edge the marchers shook their fists and sticks at 
the aircraft 
the victims were buried without incident guerrilla priest 
miguel ventura who had come secretly from the rebelcontrolled 
northeastern mountains officiated at the burial 
president bush on thursday condemned recent violence from 
extremists from both the left and the right but said cristianis 
government continues in the democratic path of former 
salvadoran president jose napoleon duarte

center in washington where the former salvadoran leader is 
hospitalized with terminal cancer

the dakotas celebrated their 100th 
birthdays with vows to make the first years of the second century 
bright ones despite declining economic fortunes in recent years 
about 6000 secondgraders scheduled to graduate in the year 
2000 packed the bismarck civic center on thursday and counted down 
to 340 pm the time on nov 2 1889 when north dakota and south 
dakota were admitted to the union 
hundreds of balloons floated from the ceiling and a 
28squarefoot cake glowed with 100 sparklers as the arena erupted 
into a boisterous happy birthday 
in south dakota state officials braved freezing temperatures 
and a stiff wind for reenactment of the swearingin ceremony of 
the states first governor arthur c mellette 
mellettes hometown watertown was declared capital for a 
day 
pony express riders carrying messages between the two states 
ran flat out trying to emulate the riding of their 
predecessors said one rider ken tichmak 
north dakota gov george sinner read a letter of congratulations 
from president bush and chided the gloomy predictions of skeptics 
who question the states future after years plagued with drought 
and depressed oil prices 
those people dont understand at all what we have here 
sinner said but we know all this and we know our heritage 
earlier sinner kidded his south dakota counterpart gov george 
mickelson after mickelson arrived late for a morning radio show in 
which the governors exchanged birthday greetings 
i thought it was appropriate that you got in a minute or two 
late sinner told mickelson we did some research and it turns 
out that north dakota was actually the first of these states to 
become states and so that minute or two was just exactly right 
officials said not even president benjamin harrison who signed 
the nov 2 proclamation that created both states from the dakota 
territory knew which one came first 
president harrison really did kind of a wonderful thing when 
he shuffled those papers and didnt let anybody know who was 
first said jim soyer assistant director of the south dakota 
centennial commission 
the president covered the papers up and then he said they 
were born together they are one and i shall make them twins 
then he shuffled them again and signed them even he doesnt know 
which one came first 
north dakota was admitted as the 39th state and south dakota as 
the 40th

the government expressed support 
today for laws that permit groups to organize and said a violent 
police crackdown on protesters last week was no way to solve 
political problems 
we see an urgent need to formulate more precisely legal 
measures guaranteeing the citizens their right of gathering and 
association said government spokesman miroslav pavel quoted by 
the communist party daily rude pravo 
the intervention of police forces however legally justifiable 
it may be cannot permanently solve the essence of these political 
problems he said 
thousands of people last saturday marked the 71st anniversary of 
independent czechoslovakia by demanding free elections and genuine 
reform 
czechoslovakias hardline communist authorities have so far 
refused to implement farreaching reforms similar to those in 
neighboring poland and hungary or initiate dialogue with 
independent groups 
police arrested 359 people during the mass antigovernment 
protest and arrested 18 foreigners according to final figures 
released by the government thursday 
all the foreigners were released including a hungarian 
journalist who was expelled from czechoslovakia on monday police 
said 148 czechoslovaks were detained until early monday morning 
twentytwo czechoslovaks had to pay fines while another 163 face 
possible misdemeanor charges punishable under tough new 
antidemonstration laws by fines of up to 2000 
rude pravo on monday said five policemen and seven demonstrators 
were hurt during saturdays rally when several people were beaten 
by riot police wielding batons 
a newspaper said today that the socialist party part of the 
national front led by the communist party recently proposed laws 
to permit gathering and association with regard to the accepted 
international covenants 
the paper socialist orientation said the proposed laws will be 
discussed by parliament in the near future and in view of their 
topical importance a possibility is considered to approve them 
before the new czechoslovak constitution is approved in 199o 
in other developments officials and activists confirmed today 
that jan carnogursky a leading human rights and roman catholic 
activist will go on trial monday in the slovak capital of 
bratislava on charges that could jail him for up to 10 years 
carnogursky was arrested aug 14 and charged with subversion 
after calling for peaceful commemorative ceremonies aug 21 in 
honor of the victims of the warsaw pact invasion of czechoslovakia 
21 years earlier 
the polish pap news agency reported that 20 czechoslovakians 
were barred from leaving their country for a conference on central 
europe organized today by the polishczechoslovak solidarity in 
wroclaw

president bush is sending mixed signals about 
seeking military aid for the nicaraguan contras seeming to revive 
that option after his spokesman ruled it out a day earlier 
we will leave our options open bush said thursday after 
visiting el salvadors ailing former president jose napoleon 
duarte at walter reed army medical center 
on wednesday after nicaraguan president daniel ortega called 
off a 19month ceasefire bush spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
regarding the possibility of seeking military aid for the rebels 
we dont want to go that route we want to get free elections 
bush had appeared on tuesday to leave the door to military aid 
open when he specifically declined during a news conference to rule 
it out 
after his visit to duarte who is thought to be near death from 
stomach cancer bush also accused nicaragua of armed subversion 
of its neighbors 
its not clear how far ortega intends to take his military and 
intimidation campaign accordingly we must and we will leave our 
options open he said 
pressed to elaborate bush said only that he would let his 
statement stand for itself congress cut off military aid to the 
contras in february 1988 but has approved humanitarian aid for the 
rebels through february when nicaragua is scheduled to hold 
national elections 
bush said it was hypocritical for ortega to expect the contras 
to disband and return home voluntarily while sending in vast 
armed forces to attack them 
the administration issued different assessments of ortegas 
offer to hold talks between sandinista officials and the contras 
next week at the united nations 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater called the un talks 
a positive sign something weve called for all along 
bosco matamoros a rebel spokesman in washington had said 
thursday that the rebel leaders in honduras had accepted ortegas 
offer the state department called the move a propaganda ploy 
because it came on the heels of ortegas cancellation of the 
ceasefire there have been no direct contacts between sandinista 
and contra officials for more than a year 
but fitzwater reacted differently today 
what wed like to see is for these positive steps to lead to a 
reinstatement of the ceasefire and to get president ortega to 
create a climate in nicaragua for democracy and repatriation 
fitzwater said 
fitzwater spoke to reporters while traveling with bush aboard 
air force one to richmond va 
sentiment on capitol hill appears to be strongly opposed to 
restoring military aid to the rebels although the house often a 
bastion of anticontra sentiment blamed the sandinistas thursday 
for the escalation in fighting in nicaragua 
the state department said two military operations launched by 
the sandinistas were largescale and involved the use of 
artillery and attack helicopters 
the house resolution called on ortega to cease his reckless 
rhetoric and said nicaraguas leaders must fulfill commitments to 
end their aggression in the region end their tyranny over their 
own people and permit the establishment of democracy inside 
nicaragua 
meanwhile ortega and the us state department offered sharply 
conflicting versions of the reasons behind a recent reinfiltration 
of an estimated 2000 contras into nicaragua from base camps in 
honduras 
the state department said the rebels intentions were peaceful 
but ortega forcefully disagreed 
state department spokesman richard boucher citing reports from 
contra leaders said about 2000 rebels have reinfiltrated into 
nicaragua in recent weeks a pentagon estimate said about 4000 
contras are now in nicaragua and 10000 others remain in honduras 
boucher said one purpose for the reinfiltration was to encourage 
contra supporters to register to vote other officials insisting 
on anonymity said a number of contras worried about a central 
american plan to demobilize them decided to return on their own 
because they feared they might be forced back against their will 
later without arms to protect them 
in a column in thursdays new york times ortega contended the 
contras were trying to subvert the electoral process because they 
are as convinced as i am that the nicaraguan people will give 
the sandinistas a landslide victory in the elections 
he said that during october contra units closed more than 50 
voter registration centers preventing thousands of citizens from 
registering 
they targeted for assassination known sandinista supporters 
prominent community leaders party activists and candidates for 
municipal offices and slit their throats ortega wrote 
but boucher said there was no basis for that version 
i think the important thing is that theres no reason to 
believe that they are engaged in any offensive operations he 
said

bombs exploded outside the homes of three 
christian legislators today shortly after christian leader gen 
michel aoun threatened to dissolve parliament if it tried to ratify 
a peace plan without his approval 
the blasts wounded a woman outside the residence of parliament

of beirut

major mistake i ask them not to take part in the parliamentary 
session let them take their time let them come here and lets

if they tried to pass the document without discussing what they 
have done with me said aoun who heads the christian cabinet in 
lebanons dual government 
an aide to aoun said earlier the maronite general and the two 
other officers in his interim military cabinet were considering 
adopting historic decisions its a crucial meeting 
that led to speculation he would dismiss the 73 deputies the 
last elected officials still in office after 14 years of civil war 
aouns cabinet is vying for power with the predominantly moslem 
government of acting prime minister salim hoss 
the conservative addiyar newspaper said lebanons ambassador to 
france fuad turk informed the lawmakers currently in paris that 
aoun has decided to dissolve parliament 
aouns move is not expected to have a drastic effect on the 
parliamentary session that speaker hussein husseini called for 
saturday 
a sunni moslem parliamentary deputy speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the legislators will meet in lebanon at any cost 
to carry out our national duty 
husseini a shiite has invited legislators for a threesession 
meeting saturday at parliaments villa mansour headquarters in the 
nomans land of beiruts dividing green line 
the first session would be to elect a successor to husseini the 
second to ratify the peace accord and the third to elect a new 
president 
the peace accord raised parliaments 99 seats to 108 to be 
evenly distributed between moslems and christians stripped the 
president of the authority to appoint and dismiss prime ministers 
and extended the speakers mandate from one to four years 
aoun has rejected the peace plan because it did not include a 
clear timetable for the withdrawal of syrias 40000 troops from 
lebanon 
lebanon has been without a head of state since sept 22 1988 
when the sixyearterm of former president amin gemayel expired 
with parliament failing to elect a successor 
the peace plan maintained a 45yearold formula of distributing 
power along sectarian lines the president would be a maronite the 
prime minister a sunni and the house speaker a shiite

challenger tom barrow gained ground on mayor 
coleman a young in a new survey while young lost a previous 
endorsement and continued defending his tally of devils night 
fires in detroit 
but barrow trying to stop youngs bid tuesday for a fifth 
fouryear term wasnt in town thursday to capitalize on the flurry 
of generally favorable news he was in washington dc meeting 
with federal officials to argue against plans to foreclose on 
detroits new center hospital of which he is board chairman 
a telephone survey of 400 registered voters conducted tuesday 
and wednesday by market opinion research for the detroit free press 
and wxyztv showed young leading barrow 47 percent to 39 percent 
with 14 percent undecided the margin of error was 5 percentage 
points 
young led barrow by 16 percentage points in a similar poll 
conducted in early october fred currier chairman of market 
opinion research said the latest survey results might have 
reflected barrows endorsement by detroits two daily newspapers 
and the controversy surrounding devils night arson statistics 
young repeated his claim thursday that 223 fires occurred during 
the devils night period in detroit compared with 229 a year 
earlier the detroit fire fighters association whose leaders 
support barrow and which is negotiating a new contract with the 
city tallied 412 fires sunday monday and tuesday 
young challenged reporters to file freedom of information act 
requests for city fire statistics but he said i resent anyone 
even implying that im a liar when you request to review the raw 
data thats what your implication is 
meanwhile thursday businessman charles costa who finished 
fifth in the 13candidate mayoral primary on sept 12 withdrew his 
previous support of the mayor and instead endorsed barrow 
costa acknowledged meeting earlier with young and deciding to 
support him however there were some promises made that day that 
never took place costa said and because of that i want to 
withdraw my support for the mayor and turn it to mr barrow

a formal agreement was signed today giving 
poland up to 10000 metric tons of pork bellies part of a 100 
million package of us food aid promised by president bush for 
this fiscal year 
the agreement was signed agriculture secretary clayton yeutter 
ambassador jan kinast of poland and philip christenson of the us 
agency for international development 
during the agriculture department ceremony kinast said the pork 
helps us to meet our immediate needs and that poland has many 
complex economic reforms under way which he said must be 
accomplished by the polish people themselves 
yeutter said he will head a us factfinding mission to poland 
later this month meanwhile he and kinast indicated there are no 
serious shipping problems foreseen that would impede delivery of 
the pork bellies as quickly as possible 
kinast was asked if the pork might have a depressing effect on 
polish farm prices he said the quantity was not all that large 
considering polands 38 million people 
bush has been under pressure from democratic leaders in congress 
to increase the aid to poland the first eastern bloc country not 
led by a communist but further aid is stalled over republican 
efforts to attach to the polish assistance bill an unrelated 
amendment to cut the us capital gains tax 
asked about the possibility of expanded aid and what it might 
entail kinast said he would like to see more of such products 
which would help us stimulate the agricultural production of his 
country 
yeutter while not being specific said that in the case of 
further money being made available for poland we would obviously 
evaluate priorities for usage by discussing the matter with 
lawmakers and the polish government 
clearly we would not wish to send quantities of food aid 
that would reach the point of depressing the agricultural sector of 
poland yeutter said

although the superpowers profess to 
have no fear of a reunited germany europeans on both sides of the 
eastwest divide are growing increasingly nervous at the prospect 
of a german giant in their midst 
nato and warsaw pact lawmakers who met here this week to discuss 
political changes indicated that europeans afraid of the rise of a 
new dominant power on the continent may be more comfortable with 
the status quo of two germanys 
east germanys new leader egon krenz quashed the prospect of a 
reunited germany in the near future when he told reporters in 
moscow that division is an element of our european security 
but french president francois mitterrand at the end of a 
twoday summit in bonn with chancellor helmut kohl said today that 
he deemed the desire for a reunified state as a legitimate goal 
no responsible politician in europe can ponder the future 
without taking this into consideration mitterrand told a news 
conference it is a phenomenon that will dominate the end of this 
century 
mitterrands comments were the most tolerant by a leading french 
politician to date on the subject 
west german officials and scholars say the mass demonstrations 
sweeping the communist state could lead some day to the kinds of 
reforms that would allow east germans to reconsider their separate 
status 
the east german state under communist party control has never 
been accepted by the people said burkhard dobiey head of the 
german policy department of the federal intergerman affairs 
ministry in bonn 
if they decide that as germans they would like to be with us 
for instance we have to accept that this is in our constitution 
dobieys comments came during a threeday discussion between 
lawmakers from the east and west sponsored by the north atlantic 
assembly an advisory body to the north atlantic treaty 
organization 
the longdormant idea of a reunified germany has been 
revitalized in recent months by the flight of tens of thousands of 
east germans disillusioned with conditions in their country 
president bush said in an interview with the new york times last 
week that he doesnt share the concern that some european 
countries have about a reunified germany 
but european parliamentarians at the eastwest roundtable did 
indeed show discomfort they pressed the west germans to explain 
their intentions 
we are very much concerned about the impact the rapprochement 
of the two germanys might have on the european community said 
loic bouvard a french parliament member 
pieter maris of the netherlands parliament noted the thorny 
problems of bringing together two germanys belonging to opposite 
political and defense camps he asked the west germans to explain 
what they see as the last step 
west european unease with talk of reunification likely reflects 
concern about the emergence of an overpowering economy as much as 
security questions 
joining the two states would boost the population to more than 
75 million and expand the industrial base of what is already 
europes strongest economy west germany 
some east european states like czechoslovakia view efforts at 
reunification as a drive powered by a revengeful spirit on the part 
of the germans to reclaim territory lost in world war ii 
the kremlin however has signaled through envoys abroad it 
would pose no barriers to east germanys departure from the warsaw 
pact if the populace so decided 
everything is up to the germans the bonnbased daily die 
welt quoted nikolai shishlin head of the communist party central 
committees east european department as saying in washington 
the newspaper also quoted yevgeny primakov head of the lower 
house of the supreme soviet as telling cbs television the kremlin 
has no objections to the departure of any of its allies from the 
warsaw pact 
istvan gyarmati a deputy foreign minister of hungary and a 
negotiator at the viennabased conventional arms talks said 
europeans would accept reunification if existing military blocs 
were dissolved 
jerzy golaczynski head of the national defense committee in 
polands sejm or parliament said his nation recognizes the right 
of both east germany and west germany to determine their own 
futures 
but it has been made clear at this conference that 
reunification is not just a concern for germany but for all of 
europe and the world golaczynski said the concerns of 
germanys neighbors must also be kept in view 
while poland and west germany have made major advancements in 
their relations recently and kohl will visit warsaw next week it 
was poland that suffered first at the hands of nazi germany 50 
years ago 
resistance remains strong in poland to reunification and to a 
militarily and economically strong germany rising again on the 
western border

president bush gave republican 
gubernatorial candidate j marshall coleman a push today in his 
battle against democrat l douglas wilder who polls show leads in 
his bid to become the nations first elected black governor 
bush campaigning for coleman in downtown richmond said the gop 
candidate is the right man to lead virginia in the battle against 
drug abuse and that wilder would have a sharp eye on your 
wallets 
with coleman as governor bush said taxpayers wont feel like 
theres a bullseye painted on their backs 
bush also said coleman knows the issues that matter most to 
virginians law and order drugs and education he pointed to 
colemans support of merit pay for teachers and greater choice in 
public schools 
but its when we talk about taxes that we know how important 
the election of marshall coleman really is bush said at an 
outdoor rally attended by several thousand people on a chilly 
windy day i hear the same things up on capitol hill that you do 
from capitol square and its beginning to sound like a broken 
record 
it doesnt matter what it is every issue is an opportunity 
to raise your taxes the president said bush also planned a stop 
in norfolk 
on thursday coleman accused the news media of giving wilder 
favorable treatment 
wilders lead has been growing in polls in recent weeks after 
he released a daring campaign ad identifying himself as a supporter 
of a womans right to choose abortion 
jesse jackson said a wilder victory tuesday would send a signal 
across the country that something profound is taking place in 
virginia but he downplayed any comparison of his own national 
leadership with that of wilders 
doug will become a governor a visible governor a great 
governor but i relate to that state and 49 others i think as he 
settles into the daytoday management of the state hell be seen 
as one of 50 governors said jackson who was interviewed at 
dulles international airport in northern virginia 
wilder who did not seek jacksons help in his campaign for 
governor was told of jacksons comments while campaigning near 
williamsburg 
wilder laughed and said that jesse is really something huh 
coleman said he doesnt think it matters how much history 
wilders election would make 
he has to meet the same high standards that virginians have 
always demanded of their governors coleman a former attorney 
general said at a news conference at the state capitol 
he accused the press of treating instances of dishonesty and 
corruption by wilder as minor foibles 
coleman stopped short of saying race was the reason for what he 
said was wilders soft treatment 
i dont know what the reason for the press coverage is he 
said all i know is i see it because i am on the receiving end of 
it 
laura dillard wilders press secretary said colemans remarks 
were offensive and will sicken the voters of virginia i am 
offended that marshall coleman is so desperate that he would 
suggest that 
ms dillard said wilder has been thoroughly scrutinized by the 
press i will leave it to others to conclude what is behind the 
doublestandard claim she said 
a poll that masondixon opinion research inc released thursday 
night showed wilder leading coleman 48 percent to 44 percent the 
poll with a 3 percent margin of error showed a 2point gain by 
wilder since the last masondixon sampling two weeks ago 
a poll published sunday in the washington post gave wilder a 15 
percent lead 
in calling the news conference coleman invited wilder to come 
and explain his views on virginias antiunion righttowork law 
wilder did not appear and coleman released a videotape of a 
meeting wilder held with united mine workers officials that he said 
showed discrepancies in wilders position on the law 
coleman also listed seven points among them wilders reprimand 
by the virginia supreme court in 1978 for mishandling a case 
sponsoring legislation to pay money to a client who was threatening 
a malpractice lawsuit and housing code violations by property 
wilder owned 
in such cases coleman said if he had been the offender he 
would be laughed out of the contest and not be in the 
running 
but for the most part members of the news media have treated 
these examples of dishonesty and corruption as minor foibles he 
said 
on the tape wilder says he supports virginias righttowork 
law which bars compulsory union membership but asked whether he 
supports a freerider amendment allowing nonunion members to 
be required to pay dues to unions that negotiate contracts for 
them wilder says thats correct 
after a part of the tape was first released tuesday wilder said 
he would veto any effort to weaken the law and said the tape did 
not contradict that position 
coleman said the tape shows that wilder is so lacking in 
personal integrity that he would take two positions at once 
wilder campaigned at the college of william amp mary where he was 
heckled by students who shouted why do you lie and carried 
signs that read doug your nose is growing and lies wilder 
and audiotape

chancellor helmut kohl has canceled 
plans to visit the site of a 1921 germanpolish battle because of 
opposition from poles his spokesman said today 
kohls nov 914 visit to poland is meant to be a major step 
toward reconciliation between two nations with a history of 
hostility 
his plan to visit st annes mountain in southwest poland 
triggered controversy because poles and germans fought for the 
site polands communist party newspaper trybuna ludu had said it 
would be a scandal to the memories of fallen poles for kohl to 
travel there 
hans klein kohls spokesman said the chancellor and polish 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki discussed the issue by telephone 
today 
the men agreed that instead of going to st annes mountain 
kohl will travel to the town of krzyzowa known in german as 
kreisau 
during world war ii a number of german opponents of adolf 
hitler known as the kreisau circle held meetings in the town 
to map out plans for a germany without the nazi leader 
some of the kreisau circle members were later involved in the 
july 20 1944 attempt to kill hitler 
klein said kohl viewed a visit to st annes mountain as a 
gesture of reconciliation not just between our countries but 
also between poles and members of the german minority in poland 
he said kohl changed his plans to avert disagreements with 
segments of the polish population 
west germany and poland have been struggling to overcome mutual 
unease that has historical roots including the 1939 invasion of 
poland by nazi germany that touched off world war ii 
ethnic germans clashed with poles in 1921 over whether silesia 
where st annes mountain is located would belong to poland or 
germany 
after the 1921 uprising upper silesia went to poland while 
lower silesia remained in germany 
lower silesia pomerania and east prussia were awarded to poland 
by the allies after world war ii and millions of germans living 
there were expelled

president bush stumping today for two 
underdog gubernatorial candidates listed a potpourri of the 
challenges of tomorrow critical to virginia voters but failed 
to mention the most emotional issue of the campaign abortion 
in a pair of campaign appearances for republican j marshall 
coleman bush sounded themes familiar from his own presidential 
campaign saying coleman would be the states best hope in dealing 
with crime drugs taxation environment education and a strong 
military he even dusted off an issue that mired his 1988 campaign 
in controversy prison parole procedures 
but even as the president campaigned on those issues the 
divisive abortion question promised to figure in voters 
calculations at the polls on tuesday 
bushs visit came a day after an antiabortion group accused 
four tv stations of refusing to air its procoleman ads 
also on thursday the democratic candidate lt gov douglas 
wilder was confronted by angry hecklers who called him a baby 
killer for his prochoice stand on abortion 
at an outdoor rally in richmond antiabortion activist george 
lucas distributed leaflets blasting wilder as a candidate who 
believes babies can be killed for any reason at all 
the abortion question also figured as an issue in the new jersey 
governors contest bush was heading there later today to try and 
boost republican rep james courters long odds against democratic 
rep james florio 
in richmond bush called coleman the right man to lead 
virginia in the battle against drug abuse the war on drugs isnt a 
war of words anyone can talk tough but talking tough doesnt 
keep dealers off the street 
the president said in a speech prepared for delivery in norfolk 
that coleman understands that the old dominion doesnt need old 
ideas like the liberal creed which blames everyone except the 
criminal 
he wants the end of a hitormiss parole system that lets 
hardened drug dealers prey on society bush said adding that 
coleman wants to toughen virginia law that currently could allow a 
20year sentence for drug dealing to be reduced to 3 years of 
actual time served 
bush made parole of felons a central issue of his own 
presidential campaign attacking the law in rival michael dukakis 
home state of massachusetts that allowed parole for a convicted 
murderer willie horton 
what are those problems virginias challenges of tomorrow 
bush asked in his norfolk speech theyre the same challenges we 
face in washington 
he cited educational reform environmental protection and the 
need to maintain a strong military which also means preserving 
defenserelated jobs in virginia 
touching on colemans plan to address commuter bottlenecks in 
the states rapidly expanding urban areas bush said look 
forward to his regional transportation plan to reduce gridlock in 
areas such as tidewater 
on thursday coleman had lashed out at the news media accusing 
them of giving favorable treatment to wilder who is seeking to 
become the first black elected governor of any state 
wilders press secretary laura dillard said colemans remarks 
were offensive and that wilder has been thoroughly scrutinized 
by the press 
without referring directly to wilders race coleman had said 
i dont think it matters how much history doug wilders election 
on tuesday would make 
bush said coleman would have a nononsense realworld 
approach on crime and drugs and would not confuse your 
future with having a sharp eye on your wallets 
wilder has used the abortion issue against coleman in television 
ads coleman opposes abortion 
but bush acknowledged the oftenbitter nature of the states 
campaign 
its been a long hard campaign and in the end every campaign 
comes back to basics to the simple question every voter asks 
himself which candidate is right for the job 
a recent washington post poll showed coleman trailing wilder by 
15 points but other surveys show wilder with a smaller margin in 
the new jersey race courter trailed florio an eightterm member 
of congress by 15 to 19 percentage points in late october polls 
white house political director jim wray said the visits show 
bush is absolutely committed to do whatever we can to help 
republicans win even against long odds 
he said the virginia race is close and were going to do 
whatever we can to mobilize the votes he said bushs appearances 
for coleman are as much as anything to help breathe a little more 
excitement into the workers and the republican voters 
in new jersey wray said well do what we can in the final 
kick to help jim courter just as important is what we can do to 
help the whole ticket 
he said that despite the polls a lot can happen in four days 
in politics 
maintaining gop control of the new jersey legislature where 
republicans hold a 4139 advantage is critical for us because 
of the impending 1991 redistricting battle said leslie goodman 
spokeswoman for the republican national committee about a dozen of 
the legislative races are considered close 
control of state legislatures is key to the reapportionment 
battle between democrats and republicans since the state 
governments will draw the political district boundaries in which 
elected officials run for office 
what the president can do and has done is focus his efforts on 
fundraising and turning out the party faithful said goodman 
its not just the top of the ticket we have critical state 
legislative races 
democrats are the majority in virginias house of delegates but 
the 34 seats held by republicans there are just enough to uphold a 
possible governors veto of new legislative boundaries if coleman 
wins his race 
the virginia campaign has been marked by often bitter exchanges 
and charges on issues including abortion taxes and congested 
highways 
wilder has hammered in television ads and campaign appearances 
at colemans opposition to abortion coleman has run ads 
criticizing wilder in a number of areas including his performance 
as an attorney in a civil case for which wilder was reprimanded by 
the state supreme court in 1978 
abortion given more urgency by a supreme court ruling this year 
that granted states greater leeway in regulating the procedure has 
also been an issue in new jersey 
florio who lost the 1981 gubernatorial race to republican tom 
kean by 1797 votes is prochoice 
courter says he is against abortion personally and has supports 
abortion only in cases of rape incest and to protect the life of 
the mother but he said he would not move to impose his views on 
new jersey women by dismantling the states tough prochoice law

chrysler corp today announced 4000 
layoffs at three plants and said it will stop producing the 
subcompact dodge omni and plymouth horizon in february 
the no 3 automaker behind general motors corp and ford motor 
co said slow sales and stiff competition forced it to lay off the 
1700 hourly employees at its jefferson assembly plant in detroit 
the company said it is cutting one shift from the 3600worker 
st louis assembly plant no 1 because of falling sales of the 
chrysler lebaron sports coupe and convertible made there that will 
reduce employment at the plant by 1900 during the first quarter of 
1990 
chryslers acustar subsidiary will close its coleman wis 
electronic component plant by june 1990 laying off 400 employees 
the united auto workers union had no immediate comment 
chrysler said it will go ahead with construction of a 1 billion 
jefferson north assembly plant and many of the jefferson plant 
workers to be laid off feb 2 could be called back in fall 1991 
when training begins for the plants production of a new 
sportutility vehicle 
the fate of 250 salaried employees at the jefferson plant was 
undetermined chrysler spokesman doug nicoll said 
shutdown of the 82yearold jefferson assembly plant which 
chrysler bought in 1925 had been scheduled for 1992 
sales has accelerated it nicoll said were no different 
from any other company were marketdriven 
jefferson produces 470 cars a day on a single shift but demand 
is much lower omnihorizon sales are projected to be 89500 cars 
this year down 57 percent from the 208000 sold in 1986 no other 
production is being assigned to the plant effectively closing it 
in st louis chrysler also said it was extending a plant 
shutdown until nov 27 to allow excess inventory to be sold 
chrysler blamed thursdays worker rejection of a fourday 
40hour work week at the st louis no 2 plant for the layoffs at 
st louis no 1 chrysler said st louis no 2 which makes the 
companys popular minivans could have increased production by 20 
percent and jobs by 1000 to 1300 if the new work week had been 
adopted 
combined sales of the daytona and lebaron models are about 
150000 a year the st louis plant can produce about 225000 of 
the cars a year 
earlier this year chrysler chairman lee iacocca announced a 
program to slash 1 billion of the automakers 26 billion annual 
budget by the end of 1990 it included trimming about 2300 
salaried jobs about 8 percent of the companys nonhourly 
employees

caesars hotel and casinos gaming 
license should be temporarily suspended because it removed black 
and female employees from a table to please a bigspending 
customer officials say 
the conduct was repugnant said state division of gaming 
enforcement director anthony parrillo on thursday i think this 
will show the length they will go to cater to a high roller 
trump plaza was facing similar discrimination charges a 
newspaper reported today 
the dge on wednesday recommended that ceasars casino be shut 
down for an undetermined period for violating equal opportunity and 
antidiscrimination provisions of the casino control act new 
jersey law and the federal civil rights act 
an administrative law judge ruled in august that caesars did 
not abide by its guarantee of equal employment opportunity for 
all 
the judge ordered the casino to pay 15600 in fines the 
amount the high roller lost at the gaming tables the fine like 
the suspension that was recommended thursday must be approved by 
the casino control commission 
the ruling stemmed from a discrimination complaint the dge filed 
against caesars in june 1988 charging that on several occasions 
the gaming hall removed black and female employees from a craps pit 
at the request of robert libutti of saddle river 
libutti was also involved in allegations made against trump 
plaza according an official quoted in this mornings editions of 
the record of hackensack 
trump plaza exhibited a pattern of discriminatory behavior 
between may 1986 and may 1988 by ordering minority dealers not to 
work at certain craps pits on a number of occasions when libutti 
played there said frederic gushin a deputy attorney general 
assigned to the state division of gaming enforcement 
both parrillo and gushin said gaming officials do not know 
whether the casinos actions came after a specific request from 
libutti or a perception of his tastes 
but in the trump plaza case it became so pervasive that every 
time a minority was scheduled to deal with libutti they were 
moved gushin said 
caesars attorney gregory parliman said thursday that what 
occurred was an aberration caesars does not have practices that 
are discriminatory immediately after an employee told top 
management about the problem several days after the may 13 
incident caesars changed its procedures he said 
trump plaza president jack odonnell did not immediately return 
a message left at his office this morning seeking comment libutti 
could not be immediately reached there was no telephone listing 
under his name in saddle river

the white house said today president bush will 
support a new attempt on capitol hill to get a pay raise for 
members of congress federal officials and judges 
were just waiting for them to give us a package press 
secretary marlin fitzwater said well be supportive if the 
congress produces any reasonable proposal 
fitzwater said bush would like to see any pay raise tied to a 
package of ethical standards that would prohibit lawmakers from 
accepting honoraria fees for speeches public appearances and 
writing 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash and minority leader 
robert michel rill met with bush on wednesday to discuss pay 
raises fitzwater said 
foley and michel both back a pay raise proposal made by a 
bipartisan task force which would phase in a 35 percent salary 
boost over two years according to congressional aides the plan 
also would include changes in congress ethics rules including new 
restrictions on members speaking honoraria 
a democratic leadership aide said today that no final decision 
has been made on moving a pay raise this year but the meeting 
with bush was sought because president once was 
she said some of the criticism has been unjust but also said 
her agency would be increasingly vigilant in assessing proposed 
mergers and in reviewing its own policies 
rill said the justice department would take similar measures 
while i have no intention of a major revision of the merger 
guidelines i want to know if in practice the divisions merger 
standards are conducive to consistent and reliable results he 
said 
the fact is that antitrust is critical to the wellbeing of 
the american economy and plays a vital role in the governing 
process rill said policies may evolve and emphasizes change 
but the voice of competition cannot be quieted 
a key part in the antitrust agenda will be supporting tougher 
criminal penalties rill noted that antitrust fines cannot exceed 
1 million for corporate violators 
rill said he supports proposed legislation that would raise the 
maximum to 10 million for corporate felons 
the current statutory maximum fines do not present a 
sufficient deterent to antitrust crime rill also said the 
justice department will pursue criminal enforcement against more 
industries and he singled out health care providers 
health care providers have always been subject to antitrust 
jurisdiction and investigation but they have rarely been 
prosecuted he said this has led to a complacency within the 
profession that cannot be permitted to persist 
the justice department also will pay increased attention to 
competition in recently deregulated industries rill said 
under new federal rules for example airlines have become 
subject to essentially the same antitrust laws that govern other 
industries 
rill said that his office has already taken an active stance 
toward proposed ventures between airline companies and in some 
cases the mergers were abandoned as an example he noted that the 
justice department opposed plans by eastern airlines to sell 
airport gates in philadelphia to usair and consequently eastern 
abandoned the plan and sold the gates to midway airlines

the senate today removed us district judge 
walter l nixon of mississippi from the bench on impeachment 
charges stemming from a perjury conviction 
nixon was the second judge in two weeks removed from office 
through impeachment 
with nixon watching from his seat on the senate floor lawmakers 
sealed his fate by voting 898 to convict him on the first of three 
articles of impeachment senators quickly followed by approving a 
second charge 7819 but acquitted him on a third the vote on 
that was 5740 less than the necessary twothirds of those voting 
defense attorney david stewart put his arm around nixon as the 
secretary of the senate read the names of senators voting guilty 
the judge closed his eyes as the list grew longer and longer 
the 61yearold nixon was convicted of perjury in 1986 for lying 
to a grand jury about his unofficial talk with a prosecutor in a 
marijuanasmuggling case he served more than a year in prison and 
in recent weeks was moved to a new orleans halfway house 
he has been collecting his 89500 salary and saying he would 
like to return to the bench to preside over trials 
we fought the fight for 5 years because we know we are not 
guilty of anything and we dont feel like it nixon told 
reporters outside the capitol after the vote as he held hands with 
his wife barbara and his daughter courtney 
we can hold our heads high because we are innocent we have 
to go home and talk about things and get on with our lives he 
said 
nixon was charged in the first impeachment article with lying to 
a federal grand jury in 1984 by saying that thendistrict attorney 
paul holmes of forrest county miss never discussed a 
drugsmuggling case with him 
he was accused in the second article of lying to the grand jury 
by saying he was never involved in the marijuanasmuggling case 
the senate convicted him on those two articles 
the final article accused him of lying to a justice department 
attorney and an fbi agent as well as to the grand jury the charge 
said he undermined the confidence in the integrity of the 
judiciary and disobeyed the laws of the united states on that 
article he was acquitted 
nixon became the seventh official ever removed from office 
through impeachment and the third judge in the last three years 
before voting on the impeachment articles senators rejected 
907 a move by nixon to bring witnesses to the senate floor they 
also turned down 6334 a nixon request to drop one of the charges 
senators were sworn to secrecy about the specifics of a sixhour 
closeddoor debate thursday on the impeachment articles 
it was thorough it was courteous sen orrin hatch rutah 
said after the debate session 
only two weeks ago the senate ousted alcee l hastings from the 
us district court bench in miami 
hastings was the first official ever removed through impeachment 
after being acquitted of the same charge in a criminal trial 
the impeachment articles against nixon were approved may 10 by 
the house 4170 
throughout the case nixon has said the witnesses against him 
lied and that overzealous prosecutors unfairly expected his grand 
jury testimony to be perfectly accurate 
he was convicted in 1986 of lying to a federal grand jury in 
denying that he talked with holmes about the case of drew 
fairchild the son of a wealthy contractor he served more than a 
year of a fiveyear sentence at eglin air force base in florida 
before being moved to the new orleans halfway house 
investigators said drew fairchilds father wiley fairchild 
provided nixon with a lucrative oil and gas investment but nixon 
was acquitted at his 1986 trial of accepting an illegal gratuity

a new board game sold in the israelioccupied 
territories challenges players with army roadblocks raids curfews 
and settler attacks that leads to an independent palestinian state 
led by yasser arafat 
but in the intefadeh game the way is no less circuitous 
than in the real intefadeh or uprising that has been going on 
for the past 22 months in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
the first instruction is a warning telling players they must go 
back two spaces if the roll of the dice lands them at an israeli 
army checkpoint 
then the player is faced with the small triumphs and more 
often large setbacks that could occur in the typical palestinian 
village represented in the boards circular pattern 
a palestinian flag is raised on your street go forward 
four spaces 
the army suspects you your house is destroyed go back to 
start 
while the game takes a sometimes light approach to a deadly 
serious subject palestinian psychologist nadira kevorkian says 
this is not necessarily an unhealthy reaction to the violence of 
the uprising 
the game is another way of crying out and letting out the 
depression without fear she said what is different about the 
game from real life is that it can be played without fear without 
being frightened by the army 
the jerusalem psychologist said playing the game could relieve 
tension must as games do in other places but she added that the 
games ironic humor also could reflect a chaos in palestinian 
values brought about by the daily violence 
the game is seen as the palestinian answer to an israeli 
computer game introduced earlier this year in which soldiers battle 
stonethrowing palestinians braving both firebombs and criticism 
in world public opinion 
the intefadeh game crudely made on a simple slab of 
cardboard first appeared in the west bank city of ramallah eight 
miles north of jerusalem 
it is being sold by palestinian activists and whatever profit is 
gained from the cost of 750 is donated to the town of beit 
sahour where residents have had property confiscated for 
boycotting israeli taxes 
the woman who developed the game said she thought it would be 
a good and amusing idea but added that it turned out to 
reflect too closely the uncertainties of the uprising 
when you see the game its very sad she said it still 
remains a game 
the woman a french citizen asked that her name not be used for 
fear of trouble with israeli authorities she said she hoped 
israelis would buy the game since it could tell them something 
about life in the occupied territories 
dozens of the games have been sold in english arabic french 
and hebrew versions she said adding that it is being translated 
into german and norwegian 
while the game is nationalistic in tone it is also pacifistic 
players go forward when israeli peace advocates hold 
demonstrations or government officials meet with the plo they must 
go back when palestinian protesters or soldiers are killed 
the game which can take several hours to complete is not 
without its humor a lucky player can land on the space that says 
a miracle the soldiers at the checkpoint are asleep go forward 
two places 
then there is victory an oval at the boards center picturing a 
crowd waving palestinian flags palestine is independent it 
says arafat enters ramallah

an american nun who disappeared from a retreat 
house in guatemala after receiving a series of threatening letters 
returned to her convent today unharmed us officials said 
the officials said they had not been informed of the 
circumstances of sister diana ortizs disappearance after her 
return she was being interviewed by a us consular officer in 
guatemala 
archbishop prospero penados del barrio said in an interview late 
thursday in guatemala that the 31yearold nun a member of the 
ursuline order had gone into the garden of the belene sisters 
retreat house a former convent in the town of antigua on thursday 
and she did not return at lunch time 
the archbishop said the nun probably had been watched and then 
was kidnapped from the courtyard without anyone noticing she had 
been attending classes at the house he said 
since midjuly guatemala has been suffering from a resurgence 
of the assassinations disappearances and other violence that 
claimed tens of thousands of lives in the late 1970s and early 
1980s a leading christian democratic politician a prominent 
banker and students have been among its victims 
the extreme right with traditional links to the military is 
being blamed by some observers for the most of the violence 
ortiz had been threatened several times while teaching 
kindergarten for more than a year in san miguel acatan in 
huehuetenango province 225 miles northwest of guatemala city the 
archbishop said 
a native of grants nm she had taught school in owensboro and 
hawesville ky before going to guatemala two years ago 
national police in antigua 28 miles west of guatemala city 
would not comment on the case the national police office in 
guatemala city said it had no information 
in louisville ky the courierjournal quoted sister mary 
elizabeth dallard who worked with ortiz as saying ortiz had 
received at least seven letters since january warning her to leave 
the country 
after an incident in guatemala city in midjuly she did leave 
for a time said the sister of the mount st joseph ursuline 
sisters of maple mount ky 
a man she didnt know called her by name took her arm and 
sort of forced her to walk with him while he talked the 
courierjournal quoted dallard as saying he knew where she 
worked and told her to leave 
a stronger threat came on oct 12 about a month after she 
returned to guatemala dallard said 
violent words such as decapitated assassinated and 
rape were cut out of the paper and pasted on a paper she 
said the paper was put under the door of her room at a convent in 
guatemala city 
ortiz had asked her to keep the letters in case they were ever 
needed as evidence dallard said 
dallard returned to kentucky because her father died and planned 
to return to guatemala on saturday 
the archbishop said sister patricia denny 54 of the maryknoll 
order left the country in midoctober after receiving repeated 
death threats 
the archbishop who led a peace march of 15000 children on 
saturday said he would ask the government to try to locate the 
missing nun

some golden oldies of the stage and screen are 
best left undisturbed particularly if they are going to be 
repackaged in wrapping that smothers the charm of the original 
a case in point is meet me in st louis the oldnew musical 
that opened thursday at broadways gershwin theater it is a 
relentlessly oldfashioned show not only because of its subject 
matter but because the production is frozen in the cheery 
complacent and cardboard style of broadway songanddance that 
flourished in the mid1950s 
its reminiscent of those undemanding undistinguished shows of 
yore the kind that had big expensive sets pretty costumes 
athletic dancing maybe a star or two and a couple of hummable 
tunes but what may have been lets say the best musical of 1953 
has a tougher time on broadway 1989 
the musical has its charms primarily a sweetsinging young 
woman named donna kane in what used to be called the ingenue role 
in the tradition of barbara cook florence henderson susan watson 
and others kane is bright and dare we say it perky she floats 
effortlessly through the score written by hugh martin and ralph 
blane and the production looks good thanks to designer keith 
andersons opulent evergliding sets 
but much of the material spoken and sung seems secondhand and 
as emotionally involving as a saccharine greeting card the musical 
itself comes from an amalgam of sources its based on sally 
bensons kensington stories in the new yorker the classic mgm 
film starring judy garland and another stage incarnation also 
with music by martin and blane which was done at the st louis 
municipal opera in the early 1960s 
this latest version adapted by hugh wheeler before he died in 
1987 faithfully follows the plot of the movie it tells of the 
smith family circa 1903 which lives in st louis right before the 
opening of the big louisiana purchase exposition 
the big development of act 1 is daughter esthers attempt to be 
noticed by the boy next door which also is the title of martin and 
blanes best song the second act concerns papa smiths attempt to 
move his family to new york a decision resisted by everyone in the 
clan for humor theres little tootie the familys youngest 
daughter who decapitates her dolls and buries them in the backyard 
thats not exactly a barnburner of a plot so director louis 
burke and his production team have filled the show with movement 
and a lot of dance some of it works particularly the way the 
victorian gingerbread home of the smith family swirls and glides 
into place and the famous trolley of the trolley song fame 
does indeed go clangclang as it careens around the large gershwin 
stage 
at other times all that movement is just an exercise in killing 
time joan brickhills choreography is upbeat endless and 
derivative particularly a banjo number that suggests the musical 
half a sixpence and a sousa march that could have the audience 
wondering whether they are watching the finale of the music man 
martin and blanes best songs are left over from the garland 
movie besides the boy next door they include have yourself 
a merry little christmas and the trolley song 
you are for loving a soaring love song from the muny opera 
version is the best of the newer numbers but the other additions 
range from pleasant to awful in the latter category is ice a 
hymn to iceskating that includes the line ice is nice 
george hearn plays the authoritarian father he has little to do 
but stand there and be stern he does it quite well milo oshea as 
the kindly grandfather and betty garrett as the irish maid have 
their own forgettable musical numbers he a little soft shoe she 
an irish jig which they could probably phone in from home 
besides donna kane the younger performers include jason 
workman in sterling voice and appropriately awkward manner as the 
boy next door juliet lambert as her equally lovestruck older 
sister michael osteen as her pompous princetonbound brother 
and an excessively aggressive courtney peldon as the unstoppable 
tootie 
the production also runs on too long more than two hours and 30 
minutes director burke and designer anderson can pad the show with 
fireworks iceskating water fountains that spurt real water and 
that everclanging trolley but they cant disguise the fact that 
meet me in st louis never has much more than nostalgia going 
for it

what other critics said 
frank rich the new york times whats the mission of the stage 
replica at the gershwin theater to spread the good will earned by 
the overture i guess and that task if not a lot else is 
accomplished by this lavish show despite such obstacles as insipid 
acting an inane book and a complete lack of originality 
howard kissel daily news maybe its the onset of middle age 
but i found meet me in st louis an unexpected delight there 
are dull stretches songs that dont really pay off a bit too much 
moving of scenery but if the show doesnt charm you your heart 
must be even harder than a theater critics 
linda winer newsday meet me in st louis a 6 million 
stage version of the mgm movie opened at the gershwin theater last 
night leaving no cliche undecorated this is a bankrupt idea with 
a major bankroll a contradiction that amounts to very very fancy

years and came on the eve of mrs aquinos trip to canada and the 
united states where she hopes to convince business leaders that 
her country is stable for investment 
among those participating were vice president salvador laurel 
opposition sen juan ponce enrile and other former officials of the 
marcos administration 
protesters defied police orders and marched to camp crame 
headquarters of the philippine constabulary military police force 
and nearby camp aguinaldo the armed forces headquarters 
police blocked the road about a mile from the camps but the 
protesters pushed through and several thousand reached the gate of 
camp crame 
brig gen rodolfo biazon a senior military commander agreed 
to let them rally at the gate because he said the crowd was too big 
to disperse later the military said the rally must end but it 
made no move toward the protesters 
by late friday the crowd estimated at 15000 people refused to 
disperse by midnight 11 am est but their leaders then 
negotiated an agreement to leave at 530 am saturday 430 pm 
est friday 
armed troops stood guard several firetrucks were brought into 
the garrison apparently to disperse protesters if they tried to 
storm the camp 
riot police on one truck flashed the vforvictory sign 
associated here with the marcos movement marcos supporters chanted 
thank you thank you 
marcos died sept 28 in honolulu where he had lived since being 
ousted in a 1986 civilianmilitary uprising that swept mrs aquino 
to power 
in a statement broadcast by promarcos radio station dzec the 
late presidents son ferdinand jr said the demonstration was a 
reaction to the arrogance of the aquino administration 
i congratulate the marchers for their steadfast and courageous 
actions the statement said you show to the world although we 
are a moderate patient people we filipinos will not compromise 
principles 
the rally in suburban quezon city climaxed an 11day march from 
marcos home province ilocos norte to demand that mrs aquino 
allow marcos body to be buried here 
the crowd cheered wildly as laurel asked do you agree that 
marcos body must be allowed home 
it is now very clear what the people want laurel said 
you are a very powerful force the government must follow the 
peoples will if not you know what to do 
he described the ban on the return of marcos body as the 
worst mistake mrs aquino had made in office 
although vice president laurel resigned as foreign secretary in 
1987 because of policy differences with mrs aquino last may 
laurel and enrile reorganized the nacionalista party as the major 
centerright opposition movement and have been seeking support from 
marcos supporters 
military chief of staff gen gen renato de villa ordered 
soldiers not to join the protest marcos still enjoys support among 
the rankandfile of the 160000member armed forces 
the crowd was the largest mustered in manila by the loyalists 
since rallies in 1986 shortly after marcos was overthrown and 
forced into exile in recent months crowds at loyalist rallies 
have numbered only a few hundred 
march organizers appealed to filipinos to join the protest as a 
gesture of dissatisfaction with the aquino government 
protesters distributed handbills warning that the nation was 
facing civil unrest by the communists it urged people to stock up 
on food water and essentials as well as enough cash to buy tickets 
to a safe haven for your family 
on oct 27 the supreme court upheld mrs aquinos ban which 
also prevents marcos widow imelda and their three children from 
returning the court ruled 87 that the return of the family would 
endanger national security 
last year a federal grand jury in new york indicted marcos and 
his wife on racketeering charges in connection with the alleged 
looting of the philippine treasury during his 20year 
administration 
imelda marcos was freed on 5 million bail and is to stand trial 
in march

federal regulators may stop allowing 
parents to carry very young children on their laps for free during 
airplane flights in the wake of the july 19 crash that killed 112 
people an official said today 
donnell pollard the federal aviation administrations cabin 
safety specialist said the agency expects to make a recommendation 
to the us transportation department by the end of the year 
testifying on the fourth and final day of national 
transportation safety board hearings on the united airlines crash 
she said the agency might propose requiring separate child 
restraing seats for infants but that she is not sure it will go 
that far 
were considering a lot of factors she testified i guess 
i could summarize it by saying were looking at practically every 
aspect that anybody could think of 
five children under 2 were carried on adult laps aboard the 
dc10 and one of them a 23monthold died hearing documents 
said in all 184 people survived the crash 
ms pollard acknowledged that there is a danger in bringing an 
infant aboard a plane without a separate seat and child restraint 
device but she said economic reasons have contributed to faa 
regulations that require separate seats only for passengers older 
than 24 months 
we have indications from the public that they like the option 
of not having to purchase a seat for children under the age of 
two she said 
most airlines allow parents who do not purchase tickets for 
infants to put those infants in vacant seats if any are available 
however most of the airlines do not provide child restraint seats 
similar to those most states now require for automobiles 
ms pollard said the faa issued an advisory in 1985 that 
recommends but does not require use of child restraint seats in 
airliners 
the faas position for a number of years has strongly been 
that infants be restrained in a child restraint system she said 
the investigation of the crash centers on the rear engine fan 
disk that split apart in midair severing hydraulic lines that 
enable the pilot to control the airplane the crew managed to 
manipulate the plane to the sioux city airport but it crashed on 
landing 
preliminary ntsb studies of the titanium fan disk that split 
have detected a tiny crack officials of general electric co the 
parts maker said this week that the crack existed when the disk 
was last examined by united airlines in february 1988 
united airlines officials said the examination detected no 
crack since the crash the faa has ordered more extensive testing 
of disks on existing dc10s 
on thursday questions about the origin of the defective part 
were raised further when officials testified during the third day 
of the federal safety boards hearing that a ge bookkeeping mixup 
had resulted in two fan disks with the same serial number that of 
the disk on united flight 232 
while one of the disks was found to be faulty during its 
manufacture in 1971 another disk with the same serial number was 
supposed to be sent on for installation in a dc10 engine 
james tucker general manager of the engineering department at 
ges evendale ohio plant that makes the disks testified he is 
certain the disks were not interchanged 
but db robinson a regional accident investigator for the air 
line pilots association told reporters thursday he had his doubts 
that the faulty disk did not get into production 
dale warren a vice president of douglas aircraft co the 
mcdonnell douglas unit that made the dc10 said company engineers 
would implement changes beginning next march in the 429 dc10s 
still in operation 
in the july 19 crash an explosion in the planes rear engine 
severed all three hydraulic lines and left the plane virtually 
uncontrollable as its pilot brought it in for an emergency landing 
at the sioux city airport 
warren said the improvements to shut off individual hydraulic 
lines and regulate the flow of hydraulic fluid will be implemented 
despite company projections that the engine explosion was a 
billioninone occurrence 
hydraulic lines operate controls on a planes rudder wings and 
tail warren said it is possible to control a dc10s flight with 
just one of the three hydraulic lines in operation he said the 
improvements designed by the company although not yet tested 
aboard a plane appear to virtually guarantee that a similar 
explosion would not destroy all three hydraulic lines 
in every way we find that it looks good warren told the 
safety board

a former engineer at the troubled rocky 
flats nuclear weapons plant who was fired after repeatedly pointing 
out safety hazards there has lost his lawsuit against rockwell 
international 
jefferson county district judge kenneth barnhill dismissed the 
lawsuit on wednesday without submitting it to the jury even though 
the jury had listened to a week of testimony 
before the trial began barnhill significantly narrowed the 
suits scope ruling that attorneys for jim stone had not 
established that rockwell violated stones employment contract when 
he was terminated in 1986 
rockwell countered that stone was let go as part of a layoff 
program and that the firing was not related to his complaints 
rocky flats nuclear weapons plant located 16 miles northwest of 
denver is the only us weapons plant that makes plutonium 
triggers for nuclear weapons rockwell international operates the 
facility for the department of energy 
rockwell officials said they were not surprised by the ruling in 
their favor 
this is the position that rockwell has taken since the 
beginning said company spokesman pat etchart we are not 
surprised that the judge agreed with it 
stone is credited with supplying some of the information that 
led to an fbi raid on rocky flats in june and a subsequent grand 
jury investigation into alleged waste storage and disposal 
violations he said he would appeal the judges decision 
earlier this year barnhill ruled that stone could not sue for 
wrongful discharge denying stone the right to allow testimony 
about stones complaints and how the criticism alienated his 
superiors barnhill limited the case to a question of whether 
stones contract was violated 
hartley alley stones attorney said barnhill ruled that 
nothing in stones contract precluded rockwell from retaliating 
against stone but that doesnt mean it was right 
we felt it was an injustice alley said were confident 
that if it could go to the jury we would prevail

after more than two years of testimony 
jurors have began deliberations in the mcmartin preschool 
molestation trial dealing with the alleged rape of children and 
satanic rituals 
the longestrunning criminal case in us history has lingered 
in the courts in various stages for nearly six years and cost 
taxpayers more than 15 million 
it seems like a historic moment but im too tired to enjoy 
it superior court judge william pounders said thursday after the 
jurors adjourned to select a foreman and begin deliberations all 
of the jurors are present on a day i think you may have felt would 
never arrive 
jurors resumed deliberations this morning 
the mcmartin investigation ignited a wave of hysteria about 
child molestation in southern california and nationally it set 
the standard for widespread fear among working parents that their 
children might not be safe in the private schools they picked to 
care for them 
during the weeks in early 1984 that allegations about abuse at 
the mcmartin school blossomed a rash of reports of child 
molestation at other daycare centers surfaced 
a jury of 12 plus six alternates began the trial in april 1987 
since then job problems and illness plagued the jury leaving the 
bare dozen panelists needed to deliberate and avoid a mistrial 
the case began in august 1983 when judy johnson mother of a 
child at the school called manhattan beach police she told the 
departments sex abuse and juvenile investigator that her sons 
bottom was red and that he had spoken of a man named ray who worked 
at the school 
when they were indicted in 1984 prosecutors alleged raymond 
buckey his mother sister grandmother and three other female 
teachers had molested hundreds of children at the school during a 
fiveyear period 
children gave investigators accounts of satanic rites and 
animals tortured to frighten them into silence 
the los angeles county district attorneys office took over the 
investigation and sent nearly 400 children who had attended the 
school at various times to be interviewed by counselors at 
childrens institute international an agency for abused and 
neglected children 
based on the interviews prosecutors initially concluded that 
hundreds of acts of child abuse had occurred at the school founded 
in 1958 by virginia mcmartin grandmother of raymond buckey and 
mother of peggy mcmartin buckey 
virginia mcmartin elderly and confined to a wheelchair was 
among the seven staff members arrested in february 1984 charges 
later were dropped against her and four other defendants because 
district attorney ira reiner deemed that the charges against them 
constituted an incredibly weak case 
when the case finally came to trial the focus of the 
prosecution had narrowed what had originally been hundreds of 
counts of child molestation was pruned to 64 counts and a shared 
count of conspiracy between raymond buckey and his mother

a federal appeals court today reversed a 
ruling that had barred the prosecution of three people for bombing 
the us capitol and other government buildings in 1983 and 1984 
the us court of appeals decided that a lower court erred when 
it said the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment 
prohibited the prosecution of susan rosenberg timothy blunk and 
alan berkman in the bombings 
the three had been convicted in previous trials in pennsylvania 
and new jersey of conspiracy to possess unregistered firearms 
explosives and false identification they subsequently were 
indicted in washington dc for the bombings of the government 
buildings 
us district judge harold greene ruled that the double jeopardy 
clause barred the subsequent prosecution because the government 
planned to use the same actual evidence that it had used in the 
previous trials 
the appeals court reversed the finding because we find no 
support for the use of a same actual evidence test in assessing 
whether successive prosecutions violate the double jeopardy 
clause 
the government is not precluded from prosecuting for the 
washington bombings on a theory of liability of aiding and abetting 
or on a theory of direct participation in the bombing said the 
opinion written by judge abner mikva nor is it precluded from 
using any evidence introduced at earlier trials 
a latenight blast on nov 7 1983 blew out windows and damaged 
a hallway outside the senate chamber no injuries were reported 
a group named the armed resistance unit claimed responsibility 
the group said the bombing was in support of all nations including 
grenada and lebanon struggling against the united states 
criminal charges are pending against four others in the bombings 
and proceedings have been delayed during the appeals court case

although the superpowers profess to 
have no fear of a reunited germany europeans on both sides of the 
eastwest divide are growing increasingly nervous at the prospect 
nato and warsaw pact lawmakers who met in bonn this week to 
discuss political changes indicated that europeans afraid of the 
rise of a new dominant power on the continent may be more 
comfortable with two germanys 
east germanys new leader egon krenz quashed the prospect of a 
reunited germany in the near future when he said in moscow that 
division is an element of our european security 
but west german officials and scholars say the mass 
demonstrations sweeping the communist state could lead to the kinds 
of reforms that would allow east germans to reconsider their 
separate status 
french president francois mitterrand said friday after his 
twoday visit to bonn that the issue of reunification will 
dominate the end of the century 
the east german state under communist party control has never 
been accepted by the people said burkhard dobiey head of the 
german policy department of the federal intergerman affairs 
ministry in bonn 
if they decide that as germans they would like to be with us 
for instance we have to accept that this is in our constitution 
dobieys comments came during a threeday discussion between 
lawmakers from the east and west sponsored by the north atlantic 
assembly an advisory body to the north atlantic treaty 
organization 
the longdormant idea of a reunified germany has been 
revitalized in recent months by the flight of tens of thousands of 
east germans disillusioned with conditions in their country 
the developments in east germany and their consequences for 
hopes of a reunified germany were the focal points of mitterrands 
talks with chancellor helmut kohl 
no responsible politician in europe can ponder the future 
without taking this into consideration mitterrand said of the 
reunification debate it is a phenomenon that will dominate the 
end of this century 
it will go quickly very quickly but maybe not so quickly as 
many would like he added in a clear reference to west german 
conservatives 
president bush said in an interview with the new york times last 
week that he doesnt share the concern that some european 
countries have about a reunified germany 
but european parliamentarians at the eastwest discussions 
showed some discomfort they pressed the west germans to explain 
their intentions 
we are very much concerned about the impact the rapprochement 
of the two germanys might have on the european community said 
loic bouvard a french parliament member 
pieter maris of the netherlands parliament noted the thorny 
problems of bringing together two germanys belonging to opposite 
political and defense camps he asked the west germans to explain 
what they see as the last step 
west european unease with talk of reunification likely reflects 
concern about the emergence of an overpowering economy as much as 
security questions 
joining the two states would boost the population to more than 
75 million and expand the industrial base of what is already 
europes strongest economy west germany 
some east european states such as czechoslovakia view efforts 
at reunification as a drive powered by a revengeful spirit on the 
part of the germans to reclaim territory lost in world war ii 
the kremlin however has signaled through envoys abroad it 
would pose no barriers to east germanys departure from the warsaw 
pact if the populace so decided 
everything is up to the germans the daily newspaper die 
welt quoted nikolai shishlin head of the communist party central 
committees east european department as saying 
the newspaper also quoted yevgeny primakov head of the lower 
house of the supreme soviet as telling cbs news the kremlin has no 
objections to the departure of any of its allies from the warsaw 
pact 
istvan gyarmati a deputy foreign minister of hungary and a 
negotiator at the viennabased conventional arms talks said 
europeans would accept reunification if existing military blocs 
were dissolved 
jerzy golaczynski head of the national defense committee in 
polands parliament said his nation recognizes the right of both 
east germany and west germany to determine their own futures 
but it has been made clear at this conference that 
reunification is not just a concern for germany but for all of 
europe and the world golaczynski said the concerns of 
germanys neighbors must also be kept in view 
while poland and west germany have made major advancements in 
their relations recently and kohl will visit warsaw next week it 
was poland that suffered first at the hands of nazi germany 50 
years ago 
resistance remains strong in poland to reunification and to a 
militarily and economically strong germany rising again on the 
western border

remembrance day the annual tribute to britains 
war dead is generating its own conflicts 
two army units fearing attacks by the irish republican army 
have pulled out of the nov 12 parades in a move reportedly 
condemned by defense secretary tom king as a gesture of 
surrender 
and a pacifist group has launched a campaign against the british 
legions remembrance day fundraising and memorials accusing the 
main veterans organization of glorifying war 
british legion billboards depict a mythical nazi invasion of 
london in world war ii and against a background of the houses of 
parliament burning declare give thanks for those who stood in 
their way 
there is no evidence that in 1939 hitler wanted to conquer 
britain said jan melichar leader of the pacifist group the 
peace pledge union 
meanwhile officials confirmed that two army units an ordnance 
corps and an artillery regiment have withdrawn from parades 
scheduled in a north england town thirsk and in two southern 
english coastal centers near bournemouth 
the parades are among hundreds held across the country on 
remembrance day the sunday nearest the nov 11 armistice day 
at the main ceremony queen elizabeth ii and government leaders 
lay wreaths at the cenotaph in whitehall the government center in 
london 
security at parades has been tightened since ira terrorists 
bombed a remembrance day service in enniskillen northern ireland 
in 1987 killing 11 people all civilians and injuring 63 
londons daily telegraph reported that the commander of the 
artillery unit which pulled out of the thirsk parade lt col 
phillip wilkinson said the risk of another ira attack was too 
great 
according to published reports quoting sources close to king 
the defense secretary accused the units of surrender to the ira 
governing conservative party legislator robert adley whose 
constituency includes the headquarters of the royal army ordnance 
corps said the pullout was shameful 
the queen and members of the royal family the prime minister 
and members of the cabinet continue to carry out their duty 
regardless of these threats and yet this decision was taken by a 
serving officer said adley 
the defense ministry refused to comment on the withdrawals 
it is a point of pride and honor for units to take part 
wherever and whenever possible although operational and duty 
commitments may make it impractical in certain cases the 
ministry said it refused to elaborate 
next week the peace pledge union plans to sell white poppies on 
street corners in competition with the british legions sales of 
red poppies 
red poppies made of paper and wire are the traditional symbol 
of the legions remembrance day fundraising 
the union was founded in the 1930s its membership peaked at 
200000 during world war ii but is now down to about 1200 members 
the british legion dismissed the protests and said its 
nazioccupied london posters depicted a situation that might have 
been a reality during the second world war 
we feel it is an affront that the peace union puts themselves 
across as having a monopoly on peace the legion said many of 
our 790000 members have experienced war who could want peace 
more 
the peace union hopes simply to cover its costs with the white 
poppies 
the british legion expects to raise about 19 million for 
veterans and war widows during its twoweek red poppy selling drive

romanian president nicolae ceausescu has 
fired the planning chief for the staterun economy and the foreign 
minister in yet another shakeup of toplevel jobs romanias news 
agency reported friday 
radu balan was released from his functions as president of the 
state planning committee by a presidential decree agerpres said

released from their functions at a meeting of the communist partys 
politburo 
the meeting chaired by ceausescu criticized shortcomings in 
romanias centralized economy agerpres said 
the committee named ilie matei and iosif szasz to replace stoian

as reported by agerpres totu was named head of a new state 
committee of planning and technicalmaterial supply while former 
technicalmaterial supply minister gheorghe stoica became head of 
the technicalmaterial supply department in totus new state

apparently came under fire recently at party meetings where 
ceausescu criticized failures to meet plan targets in industry and

program which has resulted in investment bottlenecks rationing of 
basic foods and increased exports to repay the western debt

for 15 aspiring butlers drawing a gun will be as 
important as drawing a bath 
the wouldbe servants will be taking a threeday course on 
handlng guns so they can protect employers and their families in 
the united states and other overseas posts 
unfortunately were living in an era of violence and wealthy 
people overseas who employ butlers want somebody who in an 
emergency can go to a drawer and fire a gun to protect them and 
their families said ivor spencer who runs the international 
school for butler administrators 
spencer said he was surprised that all 15 students in the 
sevenweek course said they wanted to learn how to handle guns and 
semiautomatic weapons 
i gave them the option and thought some would be afraid of 
guns he said 
the threeday course in newport wales starting nov 9 will 
include training on the use of semiautomatic weapons he said 
spencer said he didnt expect butlers to be toting guns in 
britain which has strict gun control laws and has banned 
overthecounter sales of the weapons but he said he does expect 
some butlers going overseas to get licenses and use their training 
the school which recently added karate to its curriculum runs 
several courses in london one in houston and is starting one in 
australia 
butlers trained by the school are now working for the duke and 
duchess of york prince edward and king hussein of jordan spencer

california lawmakers opening a special 
session on aid to earthquakestricken areas questioned relief plans 
but barely debated the proposed source of funds a sales tax 
increase local officials deem inadequate 
marilyn quayle meanwhile began visiting farm towns south of 
san francisco left devastated by the oct 17 quake measuring 71 on 
the richter scale 
youve got me behind you the wife of vice president dan 
quayle told the owner of one damaged building on thursday this 
morning she met with city officials in hardhit santa cruz 
also jack kemp us secretary of housing and urban 
development said at a san francisco news conference that the 
federal government likely would be sending an additional 165 
million to the bay area to provide and repair rental housing 
congress last week approved 345 billion in quake relief the 
state is required to come up with 855 million more said state 
finance director jesse huff 
to raise 786 million of that money gov george deukmejian and 
legislative leaders this week agreed to propose boosting the sales 
tax from 6 percent to 625 percent for 13 months starting dec 1 
encompassing two christmas shopping periods 
the state assembly and senate opened a special session thursday 
on quake relief several legislators closely questioned huff on 
whether the highway funds included strengthening bridges 
before i can vote for a tax increase i want to make sure some 
of the money is coming down to southern california to fix 
vulnerable highways said assemblywoman marian la follette 
huff said the relief plan plan includes 300 million 60 
million of it in state funds for retrofitting bridges 
oakland mayor lionel wilson and officials from the counties 
shaken worst said they would ask for a sales tax increase to 7 
percent for one year to raise about 25 billion for repairs 
but some republican lawmakers questioned whether any tax 
increase was needed assemblyman tom mcclintock proposed a freeze 
in state spending to save the 800 million during the start of the 
199091 fiscal year 
mcclintocks plan would delay by 12 weeks the normal inflation 
increases due july 1 for programs from schools to welfare 
after hearing testimony and discussing quake relief needs 
lawmakers broke into committees to consider specific legislation 
floor votes on bills were possible this afternoon the session was 
expected to last at least until saturday 
any tax increase must be approved by twothirds of each 
legislative house while the state sales tax is 6 percent the 
total sales tax charged in some counties is higher because of 
locally levied sales taxes 
the vice presidents wife on thursday toured hollister an 
agricultural town in san benito county then moved on to 
watsonville in santa cruz county today she was scheduled to visit 
inland los gatos seaside santa cruz and san francisco

that will be faced in the months to come mrs quayle said in 
watsonville 
robert demonte regional administrator for the us department 
of housing and urban development said that at kemps request 
congress probably will approve an extra 165 million in housing aid 
next month 
and kemp said another 300 million in housing aid already 
earmarked for the area over several years will be sent faster to 
help quake repairs 
in other developments 
the federal emergency management agency reversed an earlier 
decision and decided to send 100 mobile homes for use by displaced

the case of a woman behind bars for refusing to 
disclose the whereabouts of her son gives the supreme court an 
opportunity to refine how the fifth amendment protects people 
against selfincrimination lawyers say 
ralph tyler iii of the maryland attorney generals office plans 
to argue before the high court tuesday that the importance of 
protecting an endangered child outweighs the constitutional claim 
of jacqueline bouknight who has been jailed in baltimore for 18 
months for contempt of court 
her lawyers say the case could affect whether courts may use 
their contempt powers to persuade defendants to produce evidence 
that could help convict them 
if ralph were right we wouldnt need a criminal code we 
could just hold people in contempt until they produce the 
evidence said george burns jr a state public defender who is 
representing bouknight 
city social workers have not seen bouknights son maurice now 3 
years old for more than two years and fear he may be dead 
maurice born on oct 3 1986 was hospitalized twice before he 
was 4 months old with pneumonia and a broken leg social workers 
said his mother was seen shaking the baby and dropping him into his 
hospital crib according to prosecutors xrays revealed the child 
had previous bone fractures 
the state took protective custody of the child for several 
months but his mother regained custody in july 1987 after 
promising not to physically punish him and to undergo training in 
parenthood 
nine months later after social workers said bouknight had 
ceased to cooperate with them and would not show them her son a 
juvenile court issued a civil contempt order that she be jailed 
until she revealed his whereabouts 
bouknight now 23 remains in the baltimore city jail her 
attorneys refused to allow her to be interviewed saying she is 
hampered by severe learning difficulties although she meets legal 
standards of mental competency 
shes sort of a lost soul burns said noting that he could 
not find any relatives of bouknights i know of no real work 
background i think shes probably lived from place to place 
maurices father who had been jailed for distributing cocaine 
was shot to death in march 1988 and bouknight had a history of 
drug use according to testimony in juvenile court 
defense attorneys say if the child has been harmed or killed 
bouknight would be the most likely suspect even if someone else 
were responsible 
if she said i cant produce the baby the babys dead and 
gone it doesnt take a very imaginative prosecutor to add up the 
facts burns said you can have successful prosecutions of 
innocent people 
the fifth amendment forbids authorities from compelling people 
to testify against themselves but does not prohibit courts from 
ordering them to perform certain actions tyler said for example 
courts have held that suspects can be required to provide samples 
of their blood handwriting and voice and to stand in a police 
lineup 
here ms bouknight can comply with the juvenile courts order 
and produce maurice without uttering a sound to any representative 
of the state tyler said in written arguments maurices 
right to freedom from bodily harm and the states obligation to 
protect that right are fundamental societal values which outweigh 
ms bouknights marginal fifth amendment claim 
dan goldstein a baltimore criminal defense lawyer and former 
federal prosecutor said the states argument that the right 
against selfincrimination should be balanced against the need to 
safeguard children provokes an unnecessary constitutional 
confrontation 
if the states only object were to protect children the general 
assembly could pass a law granting immunity from prosecution to 
parents in bouknights position he said 
the states attack goes to the very heart of the fifth 
amendment goldstein said this case really poses the risk for 
the first time that the absolute protection of the fifth amendment 
can be breached 
the maryland court of appeals voting 52 ruled dec 19 that 
jailing bouknight for refusing to produce maurice violated her 
constitutional rights and that she should be released immediately 
but the same day us chief justice william h rehnquist set aside 
that decision pending review by the full supreme court

people mostly poor hispanics live in 23 tents wearing a red 
cross windbreaker and cradling a baby boy mrs quayle then walked

mrs quayle remained about 15 minutes in the tent shared by 13 
people chatting with maria rosario hernandez and guadalupe marquez 
about their problems finding affordable housing since their homes 
were destroyed they said rents are about double the 400 they used 
to pay for a onebedroom house shared by nine people

marquez said afterward im glad she saw how we live and i hope

michigan voters will give their verdict 
tuesday on almost three years of work by state lawmakers to revamp 
school funding and many experts fear theyll give the effort an 
f 
the voters will face two ballot proposals each raising the 
state sales tax to provide more money for schools one also 
provides some property tax relief and does more to equalize funding 
among school districts 
but many observers believe the combination of a proposed tax 
increase a complex issue the expected low voter turnout and 
public skepticism of the politicians who put the issues on the 
ballot will be hard to overcome 
there is indeed a lot of cynicism at least about anything 
that involves spending money and increasing taxes to spend money 
its not impossible but any tax increase has a tough row to hoe 
said david rohde a political science professor at michigan state 
university 
nobody wants to pay more taxes everybody would like the 
schools to be better its really a question of the balance between 
what nearly everybody would say is two desirable ends 
two proposals on the ballot will increase the chances that one 
will pass rohde says others maintain the two work against each 
other dividing the support of those who back the basic idea of 
raising money for schools 
opponents led by the influential michigan state chamber of 
commerce are reminding voters they dont have to choose between 
the proposals but can vote against both 
the further we get away from the capitol the better the 
reception said chamber vice president richard studley 
if both were to pass the one with the most votes would take 
effect 
if both are defeated few believe the legislature would 
immediately tackle the issue again but citizens groups might start 
petition drives 
treasurer robert bowman said if both proposals fail gov james 
blanchard would push school quality legislation and then property 
tax relief trying to limit assessment increases 
legislation already has been introduced to sharply cut the 
number of school districts in an attempt to equalize their wealth 
the state has 524 kindergartenthrough12th grade districts 
proposal a on tuesdays ballot would raise the state sales tax 
to 45 percent from 4 percent and generate about 400 million more 
for schools 
proposal b would raise the sales tax to 6 percent cut property 
taxes some 15 billion and put about 350 million more into 
schools 
proposal a has money and b doesnt said state sen dan 
degrow a republican and a proposal b backer but they both face 
an uphill fight 
proposal a backed by the governor has a campaign budget of 
about 3 million and an impressive list of supporters including 
two large teachers unions and major corporations

eight men accused of crimes ranging 
from drug smuggling to rape and murder were beheaded friday in 
keeping with strict islamic law the government said 
two pakistanis identified as mohammed dustan aslam khan and taj 
ali khan were executed in the port city of jiddah after they were 
convicted of smuggling heroin the interior ministry said in a 
statement on staterun riyadh radio 
six saudis also were beheaded nationwide for various crimes 
without providing further details the statement said the crimes 
included murder and rape 
beheading murderers is prescribed by islamic religious law 
thieves have their hands chopped off and adulterers are stoned 
in recent years saudi theologians ruled that drug trafficking 
also was a crime that spread corruption on the face of the 
earth and merited beheading or crucifixion 
there have been several beheadings for drug offenses in recent 
years 
executions are carried out on friday the moslem holy day in 
front of mosques as the faithful pray the bodies are sometimes 
hung from crossed beams as a warning to others 
in recent weeks saudi authorities have made a point of 
announcing executions and handchopping on the state radio 
apparently to demonstrate that such justice is meted out regardless 
of nationality 
this followed the sept 21 beheading of 16 proiranian shiite 
moslems from kuwait who were convicted by saudi islamic courts for 
bombings during the annual moslem pilgrimage to mecca in july 
the blasts killed one pakistani and wounded 16 other pilgrims 
those executions heightened a feud between the saudis and iran 
a proiranian group killed a saudi embassy official in beirut 
earlier this week claiming the slaying was to avenge the 16 men 
executed in saudi arabia 
the saudi interior minister prince nayef bin abdelaziz has 
rejected criticism of the beheadings by organizations such as 
amnesty international the londonbased human rights group as 
tantamount to attacking the islamic faith

west german officials will brief 
relatives of the victims of pan am flight 103 next week about their 
investigation of the bombing but a spokesman said friday the 
information already is widely known 
three us congressmen said thursday a group of relatives from 
among the 270 killed in the dec 21 1988 bombing of the jumbo jet 
over lockerbie scotland would visit bonn and frankfurt to learn 
what they could about the incident 
i imagine that these people are seeking information that would 
help them put together a picture of where the investigation 
stands said detlef dauke spokesman for the federal interior 
ministry overseeing the inquiry 
dauke said investigators from the united states britain and 
west germany have been cooperating closely in sharing information 
about the case 
i cant imagine that any new details will come out dauke 
said 
the group is expected to arrive wednesday for talks with airport 
administrators and officials of the federal criminal investigations 
office the west german equivalent of the fbi 
pan am flight 103 originated at frankfurt airport after landing 
at londons heathrow airport passengers and luggage were 
transferred to a boeing 747 that exploded and showered fiery debris 
over the town of lockerbie after taking off for new york on dec 21 
west german and scottish investigators say a radiocassette 
player packed with plastic explosives and an air pressureregulated 
timing device exploded in a suitcase 
the criminal investigations office in wiesbaden confirmed 
earlier this week that investigators were pursuing clues that the 
bombladen suitcase was transferred to flight 103 after being 
brought to frankfurt airport unaccompanied on an air malta flight 
from the island nation air malta has denied any connection with 
the disaster

a federal appeals court said friday the 
government may proceed with its prosecution of three people 
implicated in the bombing of the us capitol and other government 
buildings 
the court reversed an april 11 decision by us district court 
judge harold greene who said the same evidence is being used in 
successive trials on different charges against susan rosenberg 
timothy blunk and alan berkman such a procedure violates the 
double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment said greene but the 
appeals court disagreed 
we find no support for the use of a same actual evidence 
test in assessing whether successive prosecutions violate the 
double jeopardy clause said appeals court judge abner mikva 
rosenberg blunk and berkman were convicted in separate trials 
in pennsylvania and new jersey of conspiracy to possess 
unregistered firearms explosives and false identification they 
were then indicted in washington dc for the actual bombings and 
were listed as unindicted coconspirators in an alleged scheme 
involving four other people to carry out the bombings 
the appeals court did say that the government cannot rely solely 
on a legal theory of vicarious liability in which a jury is asked 
to infer guilt from the defendants involvement in a conspiracy 
that could prove troublesome for prosecutors since as the 
appeals court noted the government apparently has little 
evidence linking the three to the bombings and had planned to use 
the theory of vicarious liability 
the government is not precluded from prosecuting for the 
washington bombings on a theory of liability of aiding and abetting 
or on a theory of direct participation in the bombing said 
mikva nor is it precluded from using any evidence introduced at 
earlier trials and it may rely in part on the conspiracy theory 
seven people are accused of bombing the us capitol the 
national war college building at fort mcnair the computer center 
at the washington navy yard and the officers club at the navy yard 
in 1983 and 1984 
the others in the case are laura whitehorn linda evans marilyn

cardinal john oconnor has proposed creating a 
religious order he calls the sisters of life whose nuns would 
devote themselves to opposing abortion and euthanasia 
the cardinal made the proposal in his column in the archdiocesan 
weekly newspaper catholic new york such an orders total 
commitment will be to the cause of life as threatened by abortion 
and euthanasia he wrote 
but in an interview thursday night with the new york post 
oconnor denied the order would have an overtly political agenda 
i hope they would concern themselves with the moral dimensions 
of public policy but i would hope they would never become 
politicized he said the nuns first priority he said would be 
prayer 
the catholic church frowns on direct involvement by its priests 
and nuns in political elections but allows or encourages them to 
speak out on political issues 
oconnor wrote that his column was intended as a help wanted 
ad to elicit reaction from potential members of the proposed order 
but he told the post he hoped that the order could begin its work 
as early as the end of next year if enough women are interested 
membership in the churchs existing religious orders 
especially those for women has been declining steadily 
the vaticans congregation of religious does not necessarily 
have to get involved in the formation of a religious community if 
it is done inside one diocese or archdiocese according to the rev 
joseph gallagher of the paulist fathers headquarters in scarsdale

thousands of demonstrators in bulgaria 
staged the first large proreform rally in the countrys postwar 
history friday a diplomat and another source said 
estimates of people taking part ranged between 4000 and 9000 
demonstrating on the last day of a 35nation conference on the 
protection of the environment in sofia the capital 
earlier in the day romanian objections to clauses on human 
rights blocked final agreement at the conference that had drawn up 
nonbinding recommendations to member states dealing with such 
topics as crossborder pollution from industrial accidents 
diplomats said 
a diplomat reached by telephone from vienna told the associated 
press the demonstrators were chanting democracy and 
glasnost in what was a peaceful gathering that lasted for 
about 40 minutes 
according to the diplomat who asked not to be identified 
police ringed the national assembly but a group of activists 
belonging to the ecoglasnost independent group managed to deliver 
a petition 
he said there were many police on the square but there was no 
word of people being detained during or after the rally 
later the governmentrun bta news agency confirmed a group of 
citizens presented a petition concerning two hydropower projects 
to atanas dimitrov deputy chairman of the national assembly 
it said those who gathered the signatures organized a brief 
demonstration with the permission of the sofia city council 
before presenting the petition it provided no other details 
no such demonstration has taken place in the bulgarian capital 
since the end of world war ii but last week ecoglasnost activists 
collected signatures in a sofia park under a petition against 
construction of a hydroelectic power project 
the diplomat did not know how many of the demonstrators were 
members of ecoglasnost or other independent group 
at the conference romania led by hardliner nicolae ceausescu 
refused to accept any reference to permitting citizens or 
unofficial groups to voice their concerns on ecological issues in a 
final conference document diplomats said 
bulgaria and the soviet union were said to have made lastditch 
efforts thursday to persuade romania to drop its objections 
on friday bulgarian leader todor zhivkov personally appealed to 
ceausescu by telephone to drop the romanian objections but failed 
a us delegation source said speaking by telephone from sofia on 
condition of anonymity 
since romania refused to agree to the final document the us 
source said the 34 other nations at the sofia conference will go 
ahead and accept it as a proposal for action 
the sofia conference was being held as part of the process 
started by the 1975 helsinki final act signed by 35 nations 
including the united states canada the soviet union and all 
european nations bar albania 
until the current conference in sofia bulgaria also had 
harassed independent ecological groups and other emerging 
unofficial organizations 
but the presence of western officials attending the conference 
which opened oct 16 has allowed ecoglasnost and other 
dissenters a margin of public activity unknown before on sofia 
streets 
ecoglasnost which was been refused official registration 
says it has collected 7000 signatures on its petition against a 
planned hydroelectric plant in the scenic rila mountains 75 miles 
southwest of sofia

jewishamerican princess jokes are the 
most common manifestation of a rising antisemitism on college 
campuses a speaker told a workshop friday at a convention of 
reform jews 
items such as slap a jap or jap buster tshirts are 
being sold on campuses nancy kasten a rabbinic intern for the 
union of american hebrew congregations told participants in that 
groups convention 
jap baiting is the most common form of antisemitism we find 
on campuses its disguised as humor or kidding but its very 
harmful nonetheless we even do it ourselves and it tends to put 
a wedge between jewish men and women kasten said 
hundreds of college students and others from the united states 
and canada attended the workshop and some said jap baiting was 
only one form of antisemitism they encountered on campuses they 
described incidents ranging from verbal assaults to discrimination 
by fraternities and sororities 
its not just in one area or on one campus i attend the 
university of massachusetts at amherst in the socalled liberal 
northeast we had an incident just recently where one morning we 
found swastikas painted on the walls of a hallway in one of the 
dorms andrea dine told the group 
major incidents of antisemitism on the nations colleges have 
risen sharply in the past few years kasten said up from six in 
1984 to 38 incidents recorded in 1988 
its part of an overall problem all kinds of bigotry and 
prejudicial acts take place now i think it has to do with the 
number of people attending school now and the diversity we live in 
a society that has a low tolerance and when you put this many 
people in close proximity these things tend to flare up she said 
many of the students at the conference agreed that antisemitism 
was part of a larger problem on campuses that included antiblack 
antiwomen and antigay prejudices 
theres a larger issue here its not just antisemitism or 
race its that of people hating we have to start earlier to 
educate people about other people and about their differences 
said nikki horberg of skokie ill 
students at the workshop discussed ways to stem antisemitism 
and although many said they had success with workshops and 
coalitions of jews and other minorities most agreed that the work 
needed to begin much earlier 
our campus claims to accept everyone but if you look around 
you see that blacks stay with blacks and orientals with orientals 
and each group together we dont really get to know each other or 
like each other everyone thinks they are aware but theyre not 
said roxanne schnider of dennison university near columbus ohio 
you need to start teaching people not to discriminate in 
elementary or even preschool she said 
the union of american hebrew congregations is the central 
organization of reform judaism in north america representing 822 
reform temples with 284000 members in the united states and 
canada kasten a workshop panelist is in her last year of study 
to become a rabbi at hebrew union collegejewish institute of

us secretary of state james a baker 
iii on friday rejected resuming full ties with new zealand because 
of the countrys tough antinuclear policy officials said 
sources close to the talks said australian foreign minister 
gareth evans suggested the united states end its deep freeze in 
relations with new zealand but that baker replied the time was not 
appropriate 
the officials emphasized there was no major disagreement they 
said new zealand was one of many issues raised during the 
wideranging talks 
the meeting was more one of opening doors not closing 
doors said a senior us administration official who briefed 
reporters on condition he not be named australian officials gave 
similar briefings 
the usaustralia talks replace those that were held annually 
when new zealand was a functioning partner of the treaty that 
groups australia and the united states 
new zealand in 1984 adopted an antinuclear policy that banned 
port visits by us vessels capable of carrying nuclear weapons 
washington retaliated by refusing to share intelligence with the 
country and suspended new zealand as an active member of the 
treaty it also froze ministerial contacts between the countries 
delegation sources said evans twice raised the new zealand issue 
with baker suggesting that it was now time for a thaw following 
leadership changes in both new zealand and the united states 
but baker after pointing out the united states had normal 
economic relations with new zealand refused to budge on political 
and strategic contacts the sources said 
however there was a sign friday of a slight thaw in relations 
us officials announced support for a un resolution against 
driftnet fishing that was cosponsored by new zealand the giant 
nets sometimes are lost at sea and pose hazards to protected 
species 
evans accompanied at the talks by defense minister kim beazley 
also suggested the united states should support the soviet unions 
request for observer status at the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade but baker said there were still too many problems with the 
soviets centrally controlled economy for it to join western 
finanical institutions in the trade pact 
baker accompanied by us defense secretary dick cheney heads 
the highestranking diplomatic delegation to australia in more than 
20 years the twoday ministerial consulations are to be followed 
monday by a 12nation economic conference of pacific rim countries 
other visiting us officials include us trade representative 
carla hills and commerce secretary robert a mosbacher 
baker is on his first visit and said he did not want to be a 
stranger down under he also said the two countries share 
similar perspectives on most issues to a remarkable degree 
he added whenever we do not see eyetoeye we can rely on 
our tradition of close consultations 
i cannot overstate the value the united states attaches to 
continued excellent relations with australia baker said

the sun is more than 4 feet around and 
uranus is all the way downtown in eugene 
neptune is across the willamette river just where jack vandusen 
and his son ben left it 
as an educational experience vandusen and his 8yearold 
painted a chart of the sun and its planets to scale along the 
citys bicycle paths and sidewalks the scale is 1 inch to 25000 
miles and includes a yellow sun thats 4 feet in diameter 
the idea from my perspective was just to give ben a real clear 
idea of the size of the solar system and the planets said 
vandusen a former teacher who paints houses for a living 
textbooks create this really warped perspective he said 
they make planets look so big and close to the sun when really 
theyre extremely tiny and far away 
jupiter is almost a halfmile from the sun and saturn is almost 
a mile on the vandusens walkon mural uranus is downtown and 
neptune is across the willamette river 
vandusen got information on the distances between the planets 
from a national geographic atlas of the universe his son punched 
numbers into a calculator to figure how to reduce the solar system 
to city size

the realities of conflict are 
drowning optimism about the central american peace process in a 
wave of violence and terror 
in nicaragua president daniel ortega canceled a 19month 
ceasefire with ussupported contra rebels who refused to accept 
a peace agreement that called for their demobilization 
in el salvador the rebel farabundo marti national liberation 
front suspended peace talks with the government after 10 people 
were killed in the bombing of a union hall 
both the moves this week were steps backward from agreements 
signed by five central american presidents aug 7 that called for 
disbanding the contras dialogue between governments and 
guerrillas and an end to outside support for guerrilla movements 
in the case of el salvador the peace talks foundered because 
the government and insurgent armies are both convinced they can 
eventually win a decadeold civil war 
what can be expected now is total war said aronette diaz 
leader of the leftist nationalist democratic union in san salvador 
she said the violence could become worse than the bloody days of 
the early 1980s when up to 800 people a month were being killed 
most of them by rightist death squads sponsored or tolerated by the 
armed forces 
ten years later both armies are more experienced stronger 
the war has reached another level said ms diaz 
from the moment government and guerrilla representatives sat 
down to talk in mexico in september the two sides accused each 
other of lacking the will to find a route to peace each contended 
the other was using the talks tactically to blame the other for 
their inevitable breakdown 
the mexican session and a subsequent round of talks in costa 
rica in october produced virtually no progress toward ending a 
conflict that has killed an estimated 70000 people 
rebel commander eduardo sancho said tuesdays bombing of the 
national federation of salvadoran workers was the principal 
reason for suspending the talks ten people were killed and 29 
wounded in the blast which he said marks a new line a new 
political moment similar to the early 1980s 
with the massacre the fascist dictatorship has been 
unmasked the only way being left open is the immediate taking up 
of arms sancho said friday on the clandestine rebel radio 
venceremos 
in nicaragua as in el salvador a burst of optimism followed 
the aug 7 agreements 
the sandinistas called elections for feb 25 as promised 
fourteen opposition parties joined a coalition and nominated a 
candidate violeta chamorro to face ortega voter registration 
took place 
but the contras who were not a party to the agreements began 
moving troops back into nicaragua from their camps in neighboring 
honduras they said they would observe the ceasefire and fight 
only defensively but said there could be no peace without their 
participation 
ortega said he canceled the ceasefire because of an escalating 
series of contra attacks in the last three weeks he promised to 
forge ahead with the vote 
sandinista forces immediately attacked contra positions to a 
chorus of criticism from the united states and other central 
american nations and there were hints that us military aid to 
the guerrillas might be renewed 
but the defiant contras are small and isolated and us 
officials fear they will simply be wiped out by the much larger 
sandinista army even without their demobilization the sandinistas 
could then go ahead with elections without worrying about contra 
violence 
the union hall bombing in el salvador came the day after urban 
guerrillas attacked the defense ministry and headquarters of the 
joint chiefs of staff with mortars killing one person and wounding 
15 
president alfredo cristiani says it is impossible to predict 
when the rebels will be defeated but there will come a point 
when theyll find themselves very diminished and they will become 
just isolated terrorist groups he said 
but four us army colonels said in a report this year that the 
insurgents estimated at 7000 fulltime combatants and about twice 
that many parttime fighters were welltrained and highly 
motivated they concluded the rebels could keep the conflict 
stalemated indefinitely 
the insurgents believe stalemate favors them that time is on 
their side 
the 56000member armed forces of the government is dependent on 
us military aid which has reached more than 800 million this 
decade the rebels are confident the yankees will eventually 
tire of financing a tie and will be embarrassed by renewed 
rightwing violence 
if negotiations dont work out well eventually win said a 
guerrilla commander who used the nom de guerre luis in a recent 
interview its just a question of how high the human and 
material cost will be

soldiers fatally shot a 14yearold 
palestinian in a clash with stone throwers friday in the occupied 
west bank and an arab woman was killed by fellow palestinians 
apparently for collaboration with the israelis arab reports said 
also friday israels top four leaders met for 90 minutes to 
discuss their response to the latest us proposal on starting 
israelipalestinian talks in cairo 
sources in jerusalem said the us proposal made wednesday by 
secretary of state james a baker iii was acceptable in principle 
a senior government official said the leaders were not far from 
submitting a joint formula to the israeli cabinet for a vote 
the violence occurred in the old central market of nablus the 
west banks largest city with 120000 people the city was put 
under curfew by the army after the incidents 
the army confirmed the womans death and said she had a criminal 
record 
the army also said that troops opened fire with plastic bullets 
in the central market after stones were thrown but said it could 
not determine if the teenager was killed in the incident because 
his family removed the body from a nablus hospital for burial 
before troops arrived 
arab reports said the youth nadir abu yassin was shot in the 
chest when troops opened fire on stone throwers he was dead on 
arrival at anglican hospital 
his death raised to 609 the number of palestinians killed by 
israelis since the arab uprising against israeli occupation in the 
west bank and gaza strip began in december 1987 forty israelis 
also have died 
the woman naima farouk jaara was taken from her home by masked 
palestinians and found later with a single bullet wound in the 
head arab reports said 
the reports said she had collaborated with israeli authorities 
and was a prostitute 
her death raised to 140 the number of palestinians slain by 
fellow arabs most on suspicion of collaboration drug dealing or 
prostitution 
the meeting between prime minister yitzhak shamir foreign 
minister moshe arens defense minister yitzhak rabin and finance 
minister shimon peres took place at peress apartment in the tel 
aviv suburb of ramat aviv where he is recovering from a urinary 
tract infection 
rabin told reporters afterward that there was still a chance of 
a positive response to bakers call for an israelipalestinian 
meeting in cairo to discuss israels proposal for election in the 
occupied territories 
i see great significance in that the national unity government 
will continue to look for opportunities to realize our initiative 
i think it certainly has a chance he said 
shamir and arens said nothing as they left 
informed sources said israel was still seeking assurances from 
the us that it would not be put in a position to negotiate with 
the plo 
the labor party favors bakers plan while likud has resisted it 
the two parties sit together in israels coalition government 
which has led to a long process of indecision about how to make 
peace with the palestinians and arab states

the state department said friday that renewed 
fighting in sudan is endangering relief supplies for thousands of 
starving people and urged both the government and the rebels to 
observe a truce agreement 
the united states government is deeply concerned by 
indications that the ceasefire in the sudan is breaking down 
said spokesman richard boucher 
a truce in the stalemated civil war was agreed to in april by 
the government and the sudan peoples liberation army to allow 
international food shipments to be delivered 
a military junta took power in sudan in june promising to end 
the sixyear civil war and has extended the truce monthbymonth 
the rebels have gone along and fighting had all but stopped 
but boucher said the rebel army which is seeking autonomy for 
the largely animist and christian population in southern sudan from 
the moslemdominated central government attacked the 
governmentheld town of kurmuk last weekend forcing the towns 
evacuation 
on tuesday two unidentified planes bombed the rebelheld town 
of yirol he said 
the ceasefire was vitally important in allowing the movement 
of relief supplies into southern sudan and averting mass 
starvation renewed fighting will severely hamper this continuing 
relief effort boucher said 
a unled relief effort to which the united states has given 
115 million was launched this summer to prevent the famine that 
killed at least 250000 sudanese last year 
were particularly distressed by the breakdown at this time 
because of earlier indications that both sides were thinking 
positively about the peace process boucher said 
he called on both sides to resume the peace negotiations they 
began last august as soon as possible

top officials of the vatican and the russian 
orthodox church called for a calm resolution of their dispute over 
an unofficial ukrainian church that pledges its allegiance to rome 
tass said friday 
the spirit of christian love requires all to renounce violence 
which not ony does not solve any problems but impedes progress 
toward a genuine solution the soviet news agency quoted a joint 
statement as saying 
the vatican delegation led by cardinal johannes willebrands came 
to moscow on thursday carrying a message from pope john paul ii to 
patriarch pimen of the russian church it said tass gave no 
further details of the meetings or the statement 
the ukrainian catholic church was formed in 1596 in the western 
ukraine on territory then a part of the polishlithuanian kingdom 
it was forcibly merged with the orthodox church when large parts of 
the territory became soviet land after world war ii and went 
underground 
but it has emerged in lvov and other western ukrainian cities in 
the past two years as one of the leading forces of resurgent ethnic 
feelings members demand that the government recognize the church 
which is called the uniate church by most soviet officials but 
orthodox church officials are against it 
the dispute is likely to come up if president mikhail s 
gorbachev meets the pope when he travels to italy later this month 
tass said the status of the ukrainian catholic church has 
become especially urgent recently because of illegal acts by 
uniates against orthodox clergy and believers it said they tried 
to seize the transfiguration church in lvov by force during a 
service and that prosecutors have started criminal proceedings 
anatoly dotsenko a spokesman for the ukrainian helsinki human 
rights group rejected official versions of events at the 
transfiguration church as distorted 
in an interview thursday dotsenko said the churchs two priests 
and the congregation decided to switch allegiance from the orthodox 
church to the ukrainian catholic church 
he said several other priests and congregations in the area had 
done the same thing in recent months apparently because they 
believe the ukrainian catholic church soon will be legalized

glossy sophisticated and downright nasty 
fliers are filling mailboxes around new jersey in a campaign that 
some state lawmakers say has never before been so concentrated 
glitzy or vicious 
one campaign flier depicts assemblywoman marion crecco as a 
poodle decked out in sunglasses seated in the front seat of a 
jaguar sports car 
she promised to fix our insurance problem says the 
democratic attack on ms crecco noting instead she introduced a 
bill to provide health insurance for pets 
i think its deplorable this is about the lowest form of 
campaigning said ms crecco its very demeaning to all women 
in government to depict me as this poodle sitting there in 
sunglasses this is gutteral campaigning 
stakes are high in the state legislature race if the democrats 
who already control the state senate can wrest control of the 
assembly they would be able to redraw the states congressional 
districts in line with the 1990 census to give their party an edge 
in us house races through the decade 
david welch a washingtonbased consultant responsible for the 
republican mailings said mail warfare has been used in california 
since the 1970s and it is particularly attractive for new jersey 
candidates because they usually cant afford the cost of television 
ads in the expensive new york and philadelphia broadcast markets 
if california is the major league states like new jersey 
pennsylvania new york illinois and florida have become the triple 
a league he said 
the pieces are designed to deliver a very purposeful and 
specific message he said and if most are negative it is because 
the campaigns are nasty 
but cliff pintak the republicans strategist for assembly 
campaigns said one candidates view of nasty is anothers 
comparative campaigning 
contrasts are what voters make their decisions on just like 
they want to know the difference between a dodge and a chevy they 
want to know the difference between the people they vote into 
office pintak said 
the scurrilous assembly attacks come after the 1988 us senate 
race in which challenger peter dawkins referred to sen frank 
lautenberg dnj as a swampdog 
and this years race for governor pitting rep james florio 
dnj and rep james courter rnj is also particularly 
vicious with each using television commercials in which their 
opponents nose grows a la pinocchio with every lie allegedly told 
even the lovable lion from the wizard of oz is not sacred 
democrats in northern new jersey used a sepia photograph of the 
oz cast member to attack assemblyman pat roma 
theres something he doesnt have ccccourage says 
the ad charging roma promised both sides of the abortion debate 
that he would side with them 
its a desperate attempt by the opposition to cloud the real 
issues of the campaign said bea kroncke a roma aide 
another democratic ad features a digaetano cocktail inside 
the flier the glass is filled with a putrid purple liquid and 
attacks former assemblyman paul digaetano for voting against a 
storagetank licensing bill that he considered flawed 
go ahead take a sip the ad invites voters 
about 100 different pieces of campaign mail have been stuffed 
into mail boxes in about a dozen hotly contested districts eleven 
days before tuesdays election assembly candidates had shattered 
previous spending records pouring 5 million into their races 
most going to direct mail 
steve demicco a democratic strategist in new jersey said the 
mailings hold opponents accountable for their records and do it 
with style 
were competing with a very sophisticated mix of media out 
there in the new jersey market weve got to produce pieces that 
catch the eye demicco said its high quality high impact 
stuff 
in the 10th district along the atlantic coast where republican 
assemblyman robert singer is fighting a challenge by democrat 
marlene lynch ford both sides have gone for the jugular 
one flier features a toughlooking president bush and his famous 
read my lips no taxes pledge 
open it up to learn bob singer didnt listen because he 
broke his vow to fight tax increases by voting for two hikes 
singer struck back with a mock cereal box called flakes 
emblazoned with ms fords picture it advertises her as extra 
sugar coated and promises a free american civil liberties union 
membership card to anyone voting for her 
ms fords campaign struck back with a flier that shows the 
childrens slinky toy 
it flips it flops it bounces the ad says attacking 
singer for flipflopping on his tax pledge and talking tough on 
crime while backing a bill making it easier to buy handguns

a group of wesleyan university students 
say they thought they had the schools tacit approval to revive an 
annual drug party and say the arrest of only one of the revelers 
proves their point 
they didnt really do anything to stop it said sophomore 
marc flacks of last weeks bash in a university dining hall dubbed 
the smoke out 
they brought in a few cops instead of a whole army it seemed 
to me that they were saying we dont approve of this but were 
not doing anything to stop it 
the oct 27 party which was advertised by posters around 
campus was to revive a lapsed 15yearold school tradition at the 
prestigious liberal arts college students gathered in a dining 
hall to beat drums clang cowbells rattle maracas and smoke 
marijuana 
a second day of partying called uncle duke day named 
after the selfindulgent drug abusing character in the comic strip 
doonesbury was devoted to taking lsd and playing party games 
flacks said 
wesleyan officials defended the universitys antidrug policy 
noting that they tipped police off to the party and that two 
students were arrested last year for selling drugs 
wesleyan doesnt condone drugs said bobby wayne clark a 
university spokesman its not a drug sanctuary what we do know 
about and what we can respond to we will respond to 
but flacks and several other students say the universitys 
response combined with the schools stated policy showed that the 
university tacitly approved of the use of marijuana and lsd 
what theyre saying silently is that they dont consider it 
serious said louis maggiotto a sophomore from hastings on 
hudson ny 
the schools policy contained in its code of conduct defines 
the use of cocaine and heroin as serious breaches but does not 
mention the use of marijuana or lsd 
in the blue book which is the sort of magna carta for the 
school theres nothing explicit about marijuana or acid said 
flacks a resident of santa barbara calif so there is a kind of 
tacit approval of marijuana and acid arresting just one person was 
still sort of an approval 
school officials conceded the difficulty of policing casual drug 
use by students 
wesleyan shouldnt make a bunch of rules for cosmetic reasons 
that it cant enforce or has no intention to enforce said edgar 
beckham dean of the college in order to keep rules credible 
you have to keep them enforceable what does the banning of a 
single joint do for the institution 
beckham said the university will probably reexamine the policy 
in light of threats from the bush administration to make federal 
education grants contingent on the toughness of a schools 
antidrug policy 
wesleyan is a private university with an enrollment of about 
3400

the people gathering here friday 
dont mind if you call them fat in fact they prefer that to 
chubby pleasantly plump or overweight 
we use the word fat because we are fat we could call 
ourselves overweight but over what weight fat is basically pretty 
clear said marilyn rock cochairwoman of the local chapter of 
the national association to advance fat acceptance 
about 100 people from the midwest chapter of the sacramento 
califbased group is meeting here through saturday for its annual 
convention which includes exercise tips for large people and 
speeches by fat activists 
the groups mission is to help fat people build selfesteem to 
face a society with fat phobia that sees them as freakish and 
repulsive the groups founder william fabrey said friday 
were not saying people should be fat or shouldnt be fat 
were just saying that fat people shouldnt be harassed because of 
the size of their waistline said fabrey who is slightly 
largerthanaverage at 5foot10 and 200 pounds 
fabrey said he founded the group in 1969 because he was angered 
by the hostility of society toward people especially women with 
excess pounds he met his wife nancy through the organization in 
1980 
the group now has about 2500 members worldwide including human 
rights advocates of all sizes an estimated 38 million americans 
are heavier than insurance chart sizes 
fat people are bashed and battered all of their lives rock 
said if you are eating an ice cream cone people look at you as 
if youre sick 
fabrey an electrical engineer from charlottesville va said 
there have been improvements over the years with more manufacturers 
of clothes for large women and an emphasis on health rather than 
being skinny and scientists are gaining a deeper understanding of 
the causes of obesity 
what were seeing is mothers who were raised in the twiggy era 
becoming hyperconscious about their weight and the weight of their 
children said dr david garner a psychiatry professor at 
michigan state university who will speak at the convention saturday 
so many people are so frightened of being fat they are 
starving themselves sometimes to death

maverick politician boris n yeltsin launched a 
frontal attack friday on president mikhail s gorbachev accusing 
him of taking on the role of top conservative in the soviet 
leadership 
he told more than 1000 people at a public forum for leaders of 
the soviet parliaments opposition faction that gorbachev had 
replaced hardline politburo member yegor ligachev at the head of 
the right 
he also charged that at least four lavish country homes or 
dachas costing tens of million of rubles have been built in 
recent years for the communist party chief and head of state 
gorbachev has acknowledged one such summer home was built on the 
black sea but he insisted it was only for his use while in office 
and would not remain his personal vacation spot 
yeltsin said gorbachev his onetime sponsor was clamping down 
on the press and personally had forbidden the faction to put out 
its own newspaper 
the soviet president openly threatened the press pointing his 
finger yeltsin said referring to an oct 13 meeting at which 
gorbachev rebuked several top editors and suggested the chief of 
the countrys most popular newspaper resign 
gorbachev launched glasnost the kremlins policy of greater 
openness soon after coming to power in 1985 but in recent weeks 
he has moved to rein in the freewheeling press according to 
accounts of the cloeddoor meeting he chastised the editors for 
presenting too frightening a picture of the countrys problems and 
demanded they offer solutions to problems not just criticism 
historian yuri afanasyev also a leader of the opposition 
interregional group and a recent gorbachev target said the editor 
of the newspaper in his home district was fired for publishing his 
unorthodox views the staff voted to strike in protest he said 
a draft law that would have led to a freer soviet press has been 
taken off the agenda for the current legislative session of the 
supreme soviet deputies said 
yeltsin who was considered a gorbachev protege until he was 
fired from his post as moscow party chief two years ago after 
complaining that reforms were moving too slowly was later elected 
to the congress of peoples deputies by a landslide 
he took advantage of the rare public forum friday he claimed 
he is virtually banned from television and the soviet press to 
strike back at party officials on a wide range of personal issues 
that have helped establish his image as a demagogue to some and a 
national idol to others 
he claimed footage shown on soviet tv of his slurred speech 
during a talk in the united states earlier this fall had been 
doctored to stretch out the vowels and make him appear drunk he 
also charged there were a mass of discrepancies in interior 
ministry claims about a mysterious incident in which a sopping wet 
yeltsin reportedly told police he had been pushed off a bridge in a 
latenight attempt on his life 
however he offered no explanation for what actually happened 
that night 
the snowyhaired siberian particularly objected to 
intentionally spread rumors that the imbroglio involved a 
woman and to interior minister vadim bakatins statement that 
yeltsin was all bruised when he approached the police 
what did he do inspect me in the bathhouse or something he 
boomed 
within minutes of accusing gorbachev of moving to the right 
yeltsin accused the soviet leader of trying to cater to both ends 
of the political spectrum 
gorbachev the eternal proponent of halfmeasures and 
compromises can hardly bring any real move forward he said 
he wants both to please the party apparatus and for the people 
not to reject him that cant be you have to define yourelf 
either youre with the people or youre with the party apparatus 
that has held power for 72 years and brought the people to the 
point theyre at now 
for all his attacks on gorbachev yeltsin turned coy when asked 
what his program would be if elected president 
dont provoke me he snapped 
he said gorbachev had visited him in the hospital soon after he 
was fired from his moscow post and offered him a government job but 
told him ill never let you near political work 
yeltsin smiled triumphantly but the voters of moscow thought 
differently thank you very much 
the remark drew a roar of applause

concern over the environment has led plastics manufacturers to 
produce degradable trash bags and diapers designed to 
disintegrate under sunlight but some industry officials now 
concede that such products wont solve the garbage crisis and 
could be harmful 
in a draft statement circulated friday to industry government 
and environmental officials plastics producers concede that 
degradable plastics have little significant role in reducing 
landfill and could deter recycling 
if the public develops false expectations for degradable 
plastics that it will magically solve the solid waste problem 
we are fearful of an overreaction against the industry karl 
kamena director of government affairs for dow plastics said 
thursday 
dow a subsidiary of dow chemical co makes degradable plastic 
sixpack rings 
industry officials say they worry that disillusionment over 
degradable products will lead to a backlash and bans against 
nonrecyclable plastics 
more than two dozen officials met last summer in concord mass 
in a forum sponsored by the council on plastics and packaging in 
the environment a coalition of dow and other large plastics 
corporations acceptance of the draft statement is a formality 
kamena said 
degradable plastic does have its defenders 
we have a very environmentally friendly product said jerry 
l petak business development manager for archerdanielsmidland 
corp which produces an additive to plastic corn starch that 
speeds the breakdown there are certainly applications for it 
degradable products which were introduced in the united states 
only about two years ago have become successful commercially 
especially in garbage bags no figures are available but the 
countrys two biggest selling brands hefty and glad bags 
exclusively use the ingredients to make the bags disintegrate 
degradable products are designed to break down to their basic 
components when exposed to air and sunlight but entombed in 
oxygenstarved landfills they dont disintegrate industry 
officials say other plastic degradables include grocery bags and 
sheets used on farms to hold down weeds 
kamena and other industry officials said degradable plastics do 
have beneficial uses but the degradable materials contaminate 
recyclable plastics producing a less sturdy mix the report said 
and they could lead consumers to believe there is no reason to 
recycle 
allen gray a mobil spokesman said his company makes degradable 
hefty trash bags only because consumers demanded them 
youre in a competitive situation right now consumers have 
indicated a preference for the degradable bags he said 
he said the trash bags are no help as far as solving the 
nations solid waste problem 
environmentalists are sharply critical of how companies sell 
their product 
when you see degradable bags sold in stores as being helpful 
to the environment thats all a hoax said darlene snow an 
official at the national solid wastes management association in 
washington 
hefty trash bags show an eagle soaring over a pine tree with a 
headline degradable on the back the text says the bags show 
a step in our commitment to a better environment glad trash 
bags headlines say degradable and safe for the 
environment on the back though the text points out that the 
material will be inert once buried in a dump 
and a tv commercial by archerdanielsmidland suggests a trash 
can full of plastic would vanish when its degradable agent is added 
its kind of hard to tell the story in a 30second tv spot 
petak said 
the environmental protection agency has recently begun studies 
on how the plastic residue will affect wildlife ground water and 
marine life 
makers of the degradable plastic say their studies show the 
residue is safe but environmentalists fear it could contain toxic 
materials often used to make plastics stronger 
the more and more people talk about degradable plastics the 
more and more questions are raised said susan mooney of the 
epas municipal solid waste program

estonias top economic official said friday 
that the soviet republic hopes to be have its own currency perhaps 
by 1991 
deputy prime minister rein otsason also contended that the 
republics drive toward achieving economic independence should help 
strengthen rather than jeopardize soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachevs efforts to restructure the soviet union 
we think our policy in estonia is not a danger to perestroika 
but is an important part of perestroika he said 
otsason chief of estonias economic planning commission spoke 
at a luncheon sponsored by the institute of international 
economics a nonprofit economic research organization 
he said that establishing an independent currency system would 
be important for estonia because it is the only way for us to 
realize the benefits of effective foreign trade 
asked how soon this could be achieved otsason said that an 
optimistic plan looked toward launching the currency before the 
end of next year but if more intermediate steps are necessary 
he said implementing the estonian currency could take two years or 
longer 
growth of eastwest trade with the soviet union has been 
significantly hampered due to the fact that the soviet ruble is not 
freely convertible with western currencies 
otsason said estonia eventually would like to become a member of 
the european common market although that would probably pose a 
very difficult political and economic problem the republic also 
may seek to join the international monetary fund he said 
a year ago estonia became the first of the 15 constituent 
soviet republics to openly defy moscow by proclaiming itself 
sovereign and declaring its right to veto soviet laws that 
conflicted with decisions of the local legislature 
moscow rejected those claims at the time but since then estonia 
and the other republics have been granted broadened rights in 
running their own economies and setting local policies 
otsason said that in other economic areas estonia has reached 
agreement in principle with moscow on establishing its own budget 
and tax systems 
he said estonia wanted to retain its extensive economic 
relations with other soviet republics but we in estonia do not 
want to develop these relations through moscow ministries

about 400 czechoslovak intellectuals and 
artists were stopped from leaving their country while en route to a 
conference in poland organizers said friday 
historians who were to deliver lectures and photographers whose 
works were to be displayed were among those forced off trains at 
the border by czechoslovak guards 
another 1500 czechoslovakians managed to reach the threeday 
symposium at a university in this southwestern city and their 
polish hosts said they hoped the noncommunist government of prime 
minister taduesz mazowiecki would file a protest with czechoslovak 
officials the conference was convened by the polishczechoslovak 
solidarity organization 
we feel obliged to take some necessary steps to let the czech 
government know that this should not happen said janusz grzelak 
a deputy minister of education who added that he was not speaking 
on behalf of the polish government 
i am ashamed of this obstructive behavior of the czechoslovak 
government said franciszek janoch a physicist and president of 
the charter 77 foundation of stockholm which supports czechoslovak 
dissidents in the conferences opening address 
miroszlaw jaszynski one of the conference organizers said 
playwright vlaclav havel czechoslovakiahe 
seminar which had the title culture perplexed between 
totalitarianism and commercialism 
it is one of the largest independent east european seminars 
organized in poland and focuses on czechoslovakia where hardline 
authorities are resisting the kind of democratic changes under way 
in hungary and poland 
there is nothing in czechoslovakia resembling a normal 
political culture that we might feel part of there is no natural 
selfstructuring of society there is no real public life 
havel said in an essay prepared for the conference and read by a 
czechoslovak exile 
the meeting was conceived in april by adam michnik now a 
solidarity deputy in the polish parliament and editor of the 
independent daily gazeta wyborcza as a way to focus international 
attention on havel who was then in prison 
havel has since been released although he was detained again 
while czechoslovakia marked the 71st anniversary of its 
independence the conference is designed to be a forum for 
independent czechoslovak culture 
an exhibition of photographs on the brutalitiy of the 1968 
sovietled invasion that crushed dissent in czechoslovakia hangs in 
the walls of the university there is a large display of 
underground writing and a long line at a bookstore selling banned 
literature 
but many events collapsed for lack of the participants 
the walls of one art gallery were covered with picture frames 
the name of the artist and title of the work neatly attached the 
paintings however were missing seized at the border 
several films and a theater group performance had to be canceled 
a member of a group of 20 czechoslovakians forced off a train 
thursday night told the polish state news agency pap that men 
without uniforms who accompanied border guards ordered them to get 
off the train before the border and confiscated their invitations 
the officials told the group that their trip to poland would 
run counter to the reason of state the pap report said 
the group filed an account of their treatment at the polish 
embassy in prague on friday protesting that the officials actions 
were not reconcilable with friendly cooperation between the two 
countries pap said 
still there is a strong czechoslovak presence including many 
exiles at the conference also invited were hungarians soviets 
and even barbel bohley a leader of the east german new forum 
opposition group 
the conference was the latest show of unity between opposition 
leaders in czechoslovakia and poland the wroclaw branch of

the anniversary a lowkey affair 
rafsanjani attempting to revitalize irans economy after last 
years ceasefire in the 8year war with iraq has been seeking to 
improve relations with the west 
iranian officials have said dozens of spies who provided 
washingtons central intelligence agency with information were 
arrested after a network was broken last spring 
they refused to give a specific number saying that would 
provide the cia with information but more than a dozen iranians 
have appeared on television in past months and said they worked for 
the cia 
one of the alleged spies shown on television friday identified 
himself as col masoud babaie and said he had been an air force 
pilot he broke down in tears as he cautioned his countrymen 
against pursuing dreams of living in the west that turn into 
nighmares 
he said he was recruited while in turkey seeking political 
asylum in the united states 
he claimed he was approached by a mr thompson who he said was 
a security officer at the consulate in istanbul and promised to 
help the pilot obtain asylum in the united states if he went back 
to iran and worked for the cia for two years 
babaie said he accepted the offer and the american put him in 
contact with an agent called jimmy in germany babaie said he 
provided the cia with information on the air force through the 
agent using coded radio messages invisible ink reports and 
telephone contacts with germany 
another alleged spy identified himself as jamshidamiri bigwand 
he said he worked as a researcher for the shiraz petrochemical 
co in central iran and was recruited by the cia in japan while 
seeking a visa for the united states after the iranian revolution 
he gave this account an official at the us consulate in tokyo 
named joe offered him a monthly salary of 1200 in return for 
information and introduced me to another man called tim 
tim hooked me up to a polygraph machine i was taught to 
use invisible ink and to transmit and receive coded radio messages 
after that 
the cias main interest was information on the capability of 
iran to develop a nuclear bomb 
bigwand said he reported iran had the means and expertise 
for such a program 
the other alleged agents identified themselves as mahmoud zari 
feghneh and kazem afkhami 
feghneh said he was recruited in turkey two years ago and wrote 
110 reports to the cia from that time until his arrest in september 
he said in 1987 he provided information on terrain around 
mashhad in southern iran that could be used to land us troops 
kazem afkhami said he was recruited in turkey and the cia didnt 
ask much from him they only wanted information on the communist 
penetration of mashhad he said

a federal judge in california has taken the 
unusual step of ordering more than a dozen government agencies to 
delete from their records any mention that former nasa 
administrator james c beggs once was indicted 
us district judge ferdinand f fernandez now an appeals court 
judge signed the order in september and only recently notified 
beggs now in private industry 
this is the ultimate vindication i guess said beggs wife 
mary in fact what they are saying is it never happened 
beggs and three other former general dynamics executives were 
indicted in december 1985 on charges that they illegally billed the 
government for cost overruns on a prototype of the sgt york 
antiaircraft gun the justice department dropped the charges 18 
months later saying it had made a mistake 
the judge ordered the agencies to expunge the records of the 
indictment arraignment and related documents his notice went 
among others to the defense department the justice department 
the fbi the armed services and agencies involved with defense 
contracts 
after the charges were filed beggs took a leave of absence and 
his top assistant only 10 days on the job took over then came 
the space shuttle challegner accident with its loss of seven lives 
and beggs resigned to give his successor william o graham full 
control 
after the charges were dismissed beggs called a news conference 
to say that despite an illadvised illconsidered decision by 
the justice department to prosecute him he was not bitter 
beggs did not return to government service and instead took a 
position as chairman of spacehab a company developing expanded 
living quarters to be used by astronauts aboard space shuttles he 
also formed a space consulting firm 
beggs and the other three men later received a letter of apology 
from the attorney general since then beggs has been awarded the 
robert h goddard trophy one of the most coveted aerospace awards 
and the 1989 nasa distinguished service medal

organized crime investigators focused friday 
on three suspects in their hunt for the masked gunman who pumped a 
burst of bullets into a son of jailed mob boss nicodemo scarfo 
sources said 
one suspect in the bungled moblinked assassination attempt on 
nicodemo scarfo jr is steven vento jr 21 his attorney said two 
sources who refused to be identified by name said there are three 
suspects in the machinepistol shooting halloween night at a 
restaurant 
my client is innocent and i advised him to take a lie 
detector test to prove it because his life is in danger said a 
charles peruto jr representing vento 
he is not involved he was dining in a restaurant a block 
away the idea that he would do this one week after getting out of 
jail is absurd im afraid somebodys going to kill him peruto 
said in my law career i have never advised any client to give 
any statement of any kind but this is a different case because it 
involves a persons life 
vento became possibly the no 1 suspect peruto said 
because he was involved in a drug dispute with the scarfo family 
several years ago 
the several bullets that struck the 24yearold scarfo just 
missed the heart and other vital organs he is expected to be 
released next week from thomas jefferson university hospital 
while the victim reportedly is declining to cooperate with 
authorities police appeared uncertain whether the shooting was 
locally inspired or ordered by new york gangsters seeking to take 
control of the mob here and its lucrative casino territory in 
nearby atlantic city nj 
its still speculative at this stage and there are several 
theories said joel friedman head of the justice departments 
organized crime strike force in eastern pennsylvania 
one obviously is that it is a local hit and the other 
indicates it could have been from new york its too early to draw 
any final conclusions and you just cant rule out a possible new 
york connection and their efforts to fill the vacuum he said 
that vacuum was created when friedmans prosecutorial team 
convicted the elder scarfo and 15 of his mobsters last year on 
racketeering charges that included murder extortion drug dealing 
and illegal gambling 
all are serving long prison terms with scarfo getting the 
stiffest 55 years scarfo also has a 14year federal extortion 
sentence plus a life term for a philadelphia murder making it 
unlikely hell ever be free again

it seems nobody wants all the credit for the 
medicare catastrophic healthcare program that was enacted with 
fanfare last year not now that its been repudiated by irate 
senior citizens 
sen david pryor dark on friday blasted the republican 
national committee for sending out a fundraising letter that 
includes this description for the genesis of the catastrophic 
package 
before president bush was elected the democrats in congress 
passed legislation and placed a tax on senior citizens to pay 
for catastrophic health insurance 
pryor chairman of the senate special committee on aging said 
the letter from gop chairman lee atwater was at best misleading 
and at worst downright deceitful 
this monumental but failed effort was truly bipartisan 
pryor said if we made a mistake we made it together 
pryor said that while democrats controlled the congress last 
year 76 percent of the republican senators and 61 percent of the 
republican representatives voted in favor of it 
republican national committee spokesman bj cooper said the 
letter was written by a independent vendor who neglected gop 
instructions to delete the section on the catastrophic law cooper 
said it was deleted after the first mailing 
the catastrophic package was signed into law at a rose garden 
ceremony where thenpresident reagan hailed its innovative 
finanacing mechanisms which include the surtax that has generated 
all the senior opposition 
beating a bipartisan and hasty retreat the house last month 
voted to scrap the program and the senate to preserve only limited 
benefits and cancel the surtax the two chambers have yet to take 
final action to roll back all or part of the program

the federal aviation administration may 
propose a requirement that children under 2 travel in separate 
seats from their parents on commercial flights an faa official 
said friday at the close of a hearing on a fatal dc10 crash 
guidelines from the faa allow children of that age to sit for 
free on an adults lap although the agency recommends they be 
strapped in a child restraint device in a separate seat 
five children under 2 were doubled up with adults on board 
united flight 232 which crashed july 19 one was a 23monthold 
boy who died with 111 other people united spokesman robert doughty 
said in all 184 people survived the crash at sioux citys airport 
donnell pollard the faas cabin safety specialist said the 
agency expects to recommend a new child safety policy to the us 
department of transportation by the end of the year but she said 
she is not sure the recommendation will go as far as requiring 
separate seats for children under 2 
were considering a lot of factors ms pollard testified on 
the last day of a fourday national transportation safety board 
hearing on the crash i guess i could summarize it by saying 
were looking at practically every aspect that anybody could think 
of 
the ntsb is expected to issue a ruling next summer on the 
probable cause of the crash experts believe a faulty rear engine 
fan disk split in two during flight severing the planes hydraulic 
lines that are essential for pilot control 
safety board records show passenger sylvia tsao 30 of 
albuquerque nm was not injured in the crash but her 
23monthold son evan was killed ms tsao lost her grip on the boy 
during an emergency landing in which the plane cartwheeled across 
the runway split apart and burst into flames 
infants toddlers young childrens safety should no longer be 
ignored as if they do not count ms tsao told federal 
investigators after the crash if these kids need aircraft seats 
then parents must be warned that they should put kids in them 
the cause of the boys death was listed as smoke inhalation 
during questioning of ms pollard on friday fidel gonzales of 
the association of flight attendants union pressed for a commitment 
that the faa toughen standards for infant seating 
isnt this a form of discrimination against those least able 
to protect themselves gonzales asked 
we dont consider that discrimination ms pollard 
responded there is the option of purchasing a seat and coming on 
board with an infant child restraint system 
ms pollard acknowledged there is danger in bringing an infant 
aboard a plane without a separate seat and child restraint device 
but she and a vice president of an association representing major 
airlines said many parents want to hold their children under 2 
during flights 
most airlines allow parents who do not purchase tickets for ins 
to put those infants in vacant seats if available most airlines 
do not provide child restraint seats similar to seats that most 
states require for automobiles 
united allows adults to carry on child restraint seats for 
youngsters but if a seat on the plane is not available the 
restraint device must be checked as baggage unless the adult buys 
a separate seat united offers discounted rates for infants 
when asked if united would support a mandatory infant seating 
policy doughty said we dont have an official opinion on that 
at this point

with controversy growing over a congressional 
resolution condemning the genocide of armenians in the early 1900s 
senate minority leader bob dole on friday criticized reported 
israeli lobbying against the measure 
i am disappointed that members of the jewish community who 
have suffered such unspeakable horrors because of the nazi 
genocide should fail to be sensitive to the similar feelings which 
affect the armenianamerican community the kansas republican 
said in a senate floor speech 
the resolution approved last month by the senate judiciary 
committee and awaiting floor action commemorates the 15 million 
armenians killed in the final years of the ottoman empire in 
turkey the resolution has become a bitter irritant in us 
relations with turkey an important nato ally and host to us 
military bases 
turkey already has restricted privileges of some american 
personnel at the bases 
dole said he was particularly concerned by reports that israels 
embassy in washington had actively lobbied against the resolution 
which could be a violation of the law barring foreign diplomats 
from seeking to influence legislation 
israeli ambassador moshe arad assured him that no member of 
the embassy staff has approached any jewish organization to lobby 
against the resolution dole said but reports of lobbying activity 
have persisted 
arad in a letter to dole noted that turkey is the only 
nonarab moslem country in the world to have diplomatic relations 
with israel and added it is therefore only natural that issues 
concerning turkey are the subject of our attention 
dole sent another letter this week to arad asking further 
assurances that no embassy official has approached any american 
group or person offering views on the legislation 
president bush who has been caught in a bind over the issue 
wrote to dole on friday opposing the resolution but acknowledging 
the concerns of armenians and asking to join in an effort to draft 
a resolution that would be more acceptable to turkey 
dole was scheduled to meet next week with white house chief of 
staff john sununu to work out some solution to the problem dole 
remained confident that the resolution could pass on the senate 
floor even though the number of sponsors of his bill has shrunk 
from more than 60 to 47 under white house pressure 
bush during the presidential campaign last year acknowledged 
that the united states must acknowledge the attempted genocide of 
the armenian people in the last years of the ottoman empire 
but he now faces international complications because of that 
promise and turkish officials are threatening far more serious 
consequences if doles resolution passes including cutting off 
relations with the united states

lykins a spokesman for the health department 
the team could begin work as early as saturday she said

hoffman said 
the only element the 16 cases had in common was attendance at 
the reunion activities at the hotel hoffman said 
not only is a combination of environmental factors required 
he said there also must be a congregation of people who would be 
at increased risk the elderly those with compromised immune 
systems cancer or those with chronic heart or lung conditions 
legionnaires disease first identified in an outbreak in 1976 
in philadelphia primarily affects adults older than 50 years 
especially smokers or people with chronic illnesses such as 
cancer health officials said 
symptoms include pneumonia fever headache appetite loss 
muscle aches coughs and abdominal pain 
the outbreak of legionnaires disease at the pennsylvania 
american legion convention at the bellevuestratford hotel in 
philadelphia killed 34 people 
since the lamar pneumonia outbreak was reported health 
department employees have contacted nearly 250 people from 21 
states who attended the reunion to see if they had similar 
symptoms those who reported symptoms were given blood and urine 
samples officials said 
hoffman said organizers of 12 other groups that stayed at the 
hotel between sept 7 and oct 15 have been contacted but no 
illnesses were reported 
the bacterium believed to be responsible is found in soil and 
grows in water including water left in air conditioning ducts 
storage tanks and rivers health officials said 
the disease is not passed from person to person and is treatable

resolution friday censuring a councilman for a racist remark about 
the renaming of an airport for the late us rep mickey leland 
the longtime houston democrat died in an aug 7 plane crash 
while aiding famine victims in africa 
jim westmoreland a member of this body has seriously damaged 
the wellearned dignity of the houston city council by making 
racially inflammatory statements which incorrectly imply that 
vestiges of bigotry exist within this diverse body the 
resolution said 
westmoreland voted for the resolution which passed 140

came two weeks after westmoreland suggested to a reporter that 
houston intercontinental airport be renamed nigger 
international to satisfy council members wanting to rename the 
airport for leland who was black 
the resolution said the council finds the remarks of jim 
westmoreland to be morally without character and do not in any way 
represent the true feelings of any member of this council toward 
any individuals or groups of individuals regardless of their race

that i made do not reflect at all the feelings or the drive and 
direction of the city council westmoreland said of the

his atlarge seat tuesday he has apologized for his remarks but 
claims he actually said negro international in joking about the

drunken drivers be painted black to please the black citizens and 
those against drunken driving 
during the councils regular weekly session wednesday hundreds 
packed the council chambers to demand westmorelands resignation

cotton farmers in 1990 will have to idle only 
half as much acreage as they did this year to qualify for federal 
price support benefits agriculture secretary clayton yeutter 
announced friday 
yeutter said the 1990 cotton program strikes a balance between 
the needs of the marketplace budget considerations and producer 
concerns about surpluses 
to be eligible for federal benefits cotton farmers in 1990 will 
be required to set aside from production 125 percent of their 
acreage base compared with a 1989 acreage reduction of 25 percent 
department analysts say global cotton supplies are the lowest in 
at least five years due to smaller harvests and greater use by 
textile mills 
the us cotton crop this year is forecast at 12 million bales 
more than three million bales below the 1988 harvest domestic mill 
use is expected to be eight million bales and exports 78 million 
the largest total use in 30 years 
by the end of the 198990 cotton marketing year next aug 1 the 
us stockpile is expected to be about 33 million bales down from 
71 million bales this aug 1 that would be the smallest us 
inventory since 1983 
yeutter said the established target price for upland cotton 
in 1990 will be 729 cents per pound down from 734 cents this 
year the loan level will be 5027 cents per pound for the base 
quality cotton up from 50 cents for the 1989 crop 
the loan rate is how much usda will advance farmers on their 
crops which are used as collateral target prices are used to 
compute deficiency payments to make up the difference between 
market prices or loan levels whichever are higher 
yeutter said plan b of the cotton marketing program will 
remain in effect for 1990 under this plan 1990crop cotton 
pledged as collateral for a price support loan may be repaid at the 
original loan level or an adjusted world price whichever is lower

the senate voted overwhelmingly friday to 
remove walter l nixon jr of mississippi as a judge of the us 
district court in a case stemming from his conviction on perjury 
charges 
the softspoken 61yearold nixon became the second judge 
removed by the senate by impeachment in two weeks 
it is therefore ordered and adjudged that the said walter l 
nixon jr be removed from office declared sen robert c byrd 
dwva presiding over the senate at the close of the proceedings 
the senate convicted nixon 898 of lying to a federal grand 
jury when he said he never talked with a county prosecutor about a 
marijuana smuggling case involving the son of a wealthy contractor 
it quickly followed by convicting him 7819 of lying to the 
grand jury in his 1984 appearance when he said he had nothing to do 
with the marijuana case 
however the senate acquitted nixon on the third and final 
charge which alleged that he undermined confidence in the 
judiciary by lying not only to the grand jury but to a justice 
department attorney and an fbi agent 
the lawmakers voted 5740 a majority for guilty but short of 
the twothirds needed to convict 
we fought the fight for five and one half years because we 
know we are not guilty of anything and dont feel like it nixon 
told reporters outside the capitol we can hold our heads high 
because we are innocent 
defense attorney david stewart put his arm around nixon as the 
secretary of the senate read the list of lawmakers voting guilty 
the judge blinked repeatedly and then closed his eyes as the list 
grew longer and longer 
nixon was convicted of two counts of perjury in 1986 and 
sentenced to five years in prison he began serving the term at 
eglin air force base in florida in march 1988 moving to a new 
orleans halfway house in july he is eligible for release this 
month 
we have to go home and talk about things and get on with our 
lives nixon said holding hands with his wife barbara and 
daughter courtney 
nixon had continued to collect his 89500 judicial salary while 
serving his sentence and had expressed hope of returning to the 
bench the salary ends with removal from office 
the senates action came exactly two weeks after it removed 
alcee l hastings from the us district court in miami for 
conspiracy to obtain a 150000 payoff and lying about it to a jury 
that acquitted him in 1983 
hastings became the first public official removed from the bench 
after having been acquitted of the offense charged in a criminal 
trial nixon was the seventh official all of them judges removed 
from office through impeachment 
nixon was convicted on charges of lying when he told the federal 
grand jury he didnt discuss the marijuana case with paul holmes 
then district attorney of forrest county miss and an old friend 
a defendant in the case was drew fairchild a manager of the 
hattiesburg miss airport and the son of wealthy contractor wylie 
fairchild 
investigators later found that the elder fairchild had helped 
nixon obtain a highly lucrative oil and gas investment but the 
judge was acquitted of receiving an illegal gratuity 
nixon contends he was the victim of witnesses who lied and 
overzealous prosecutors who held him to unreasonably high standards 
of accuracy in his grand jury testimony he admitted making a few 
slips but put them down as honest forgetfulness 
sen terry sanford dnc one of eight lawmakers who voted to 
acquit on the first article said in a statement he did so to 
protest this criminal investigative device of failing to establish 
a real crime and then searching around in the ashes for bits of 
perjury 
sanford said he voted to acquit because the false statements 
if made were trivial matters not related to the actual crime the 
case against judge nixon was contrived and manufactured by the 
justice department and based in part on testimony written for a 
witness by department employees 
another lawmaker who voted to acquit sen claiborne pell 
dri said in a statement 
i wasnt convinced by the evidence and the arguments presented 
to the senate that he had deliberately lied or commited perjury

the nicaraguan contras have been ordered to 
evade contact with sandinista army units who are waging very 
serious offensive operations after president daniel ortega called 
off a ceasefire an administration official said friday 
but the official was unable to report on how much headway the 
sandinista forces had made since the attacks were launched late 
wednesday 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
sandinistas are using elite batallions and heavy weapons in their 
efforts to attack isolate drive out and wipe out the 
resistance forces in nicaragua 
the resistances orders as i understand them are to try to 
evade contact as best as possible the official said during a 
briefing for reporters 
ortega called off the ceasefire contending that the 
usbacked contras have systematically engaged in terrorist 
activities aimed at disrupting the election process in nicaragua 
at one point ortega indicated he might call off the elections 
but sandinista officials have given assurances that the feb 25 
elections will go ahead as scheduled 
us officials have denied that the contras have engaged in 
offensive operations and said that the sandinistas never abided by 
the ceasefire in the first place 
meanwhile state department deputy spokesman richard boucher 
called on the sandinistas to end their offensive in advance of a 
negotiating session in new york on monday with the contra military 
leaders 
the meeting will deal with agreements that call for the peaceful 
reintegration of the rebels into nicaraguan society as part of an 
overall settlement of that countrys sevenyear old internal 
conflict 
there have been no direct contacts between sandinista and contra 
officials in well over a year but ortega proposed the talks on 
wednesday when he was announcing the suspension of the ceasefire 
we believe that the sandinistas should stop their offensive if 
they really want to help this meeting to achieve positive 
results boucher said 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater called the un talks 
a positive sign something weve called for all along 
what wed like to see is for these positive steps to lead to a 
reinstatement of the ceasefire and to get president ortega to 
create a climate in nicaragua for democracy and repatriation 
fitzwater said 
fitzwaters remarks were more upbeat than boucher was on 
thursday when he questioned ortegas sincerity in calling for 
talks on the same day when he was suspending the ceasefire

president bush campaigned for underdog 
republican gubernatorial candidates in virginia and new jersey 
friday talking of crime drugs and other challenges of 
tomorrow but avoiding the lightningrod issue of abortion as the 
offyear election campaign entered its final weekend 
stumping for j marshall coleman in virginia and james courter 
in new jersey the president resurrected themes from his 1988 
campaign book including his pledge against raising taxes 
if voters of new jersey want to gamble they go to atlantic 
city bush told a rally for courter in bloomfield nj but 
they know better than to risk their economy on the bigspending and 
hightaxing policies of the democrats 
although dogged by prochoice demonstrators at each of three 
campaign stops bush steered clear of the abortion controversy 
democrat l douglas wilder has made support for abortion rights 
a central theme of his campaign for governor of virginia and 
recent polls say he is leading coleman by margins varying from four 
to 15 points 
rep james florio is favored to return the governorship of new 
jersey to democratic control after eight years in republican hands 
abortion also has been in the forefront of the campaign in that 
state 
wilder campaigned friday in portsmouth where he told students 
at a high school that if he is elected they can expect to be 
expelled from school if they get caught using drugs 
wilder who also spoke at a northern virginia senior citizens 
center friday will spend the weekend before the election in the 
far southwest mountains of the state where united mine workers 
have been on strike since april against the pittston coal group inc 
barbara bush meanwhile was in new york city campaigning for 
gop mayoral candidate rudolph w giuliani in his race against 
democrat david n dinkins 
the presidents wife spoke at a fundraiser that brought in 
360000 for the underdog giuliani campaign she said the former 
prosecutor knows that the new york city schools are our first and 
best hope for the people and the future of this very great city 
with rudy at gracie mansion we have at last a real chance to turn 
things around 
the two gubernatorial races and the contest to succeed ed koch 
as mayor of new york were getting the most attention this light 
political year in addition to other election factors wilder would 
be the nations first black elected governor and dinkins new yorks 
first black mayor 
elsewhere on tuesday houston voters will fill the late rep 
mickey lelands seat and hundreds of contests for mayor also will 
be decided including in such major cities as detroit cleveland 
and seattle 
coleman and courter found themselves on the defensive this 
summer and fall when their antiabortion stands views similar to 
those forcefully expressed by bush in two recent vetoes became 
central issues 
bush speaking to several thousand coleman supporters at old 
dominion university asked what were the states problems 
virginias challenges of tomorrow and answered that theyre 
the same challenges we face in washington educational reform 
environmental protection and a need to maintain a strong military 
earlier he spoke at a rally in a park in downtown richmond as 
several dozen prochoice demonstrators heckled from the back of the 
crowd some carrying signs that said keep abortion legal 
recycling themes from last years presidential race bush 
praised coleman a former state attorney general for strong stands 
on crime drugs education the environment and nonewtaxes 
with marshall coleman in the statehouse taxpayers wont feel 
like theres a bulls eye painted on their backs bush told the 
rally 
for his part coleman told bush i will seek to emulate you by 
following the highest ethical standards 
over the past few weeks bush has vetoed two spending bills over 
a provision that would extend eligibility for federally funded 
abortions for poor women to cases of rape and incest current law 
which bush supports only permits the use of tax dollars to pay 
for abortions when the womans life is in danger 
coleman and courter both have strong antiabortion views which 
their democratic opponents have actively sought to turn to their 
advantage by trumpeting their own prochoice positions 
public opinion polls have shown the abortion issue to be a major 
factor in both states especially among female voters 
coleman opposes abortion in all cases except where the life of 
the mother is endangered although he has said he would not propose 
legislation to outlaw abortions in cases of rape or incest 
in new jersey florio has made an issue of courters history of 
antiabortion votes in the house courter has said that if 
elected he will not seek to change st

a shelter for gods stray animals clung 
to the hope friday that a wealthy donor would buy land in alabama 
for more than 1600 dogs and cats before the county shuts it down 
we had our foot halfway out the gate when the county took 
over said ronnie denney the soninlaw of owners ann and jerry 
fields now were just trying to get the animals out before the 
county kills them 
officials at life for gods stray animals have waged a 10year 
court battle over neighbors charges of noise and odor the 
fieldses went into hiding in july 1986 to avoid contempt of court 
charges 
the struggle has attracted national attention and prompted 
donations from sources such as the doris day pet foundation in 
california a dekalb county woman left her 65000 home to the 
fieldses 
last week the georgia supreme court upheld rockdale countys 
right to remove the animals on the grounds that the shelter was a 
public nuisance violated zoning ordinances in this largely rural 
area 20 miles east of atlanta and was registered illegally as a 
nonprofit organization 
the fieldses are believed to be out of state but county 
authorities and shelter officials say they still control the 
shelter sending money to feed the animals 
on friday denney announced that nina friedman whose family 
owns a chain of more than 100 jewelry stores in the southeast had 
promised to buy 240 acres of land near andalusia ala to house 
the shelter 
a saleswoman with south court realty in alabama sheila adkison 
confirmed that ms friedman had sent representatives to see the 
land and said she expected her to return a signed copy of the 
contract within a week ms adkison said ms friedman was out of 
the country friday 
cheryl mcauliffe president of the georgia chapter of fund for 
animals pleaded with the county friday to give the shelter 60 days 
to move the animals to the new site 
there is no reason for a mass execution except to rid the 
county of this shelter she said animals that are old sick 
and lame could be in the care of people who have loved them for 
years instead of being extinguished like old rags 
talk of a lastminute move was greeted with skepticism by county 
officials who would have to approve it 
nevertheless b lee york assistant to the county commission 
chairman promised ms mcauliffe that the county will not move in 
before nov 10 and hopes to find homes for most of the animals he 
conceded that some will have to be destroyed though 
we will make every effort possible to see whether every animal 
can be adopted he said we are not the bad guys here 
county officials plan to meet about the shelter next week york 
said and commission chairman randy poynter has promised to look at 
any plans shelter officials can present about moving to a new site 
shelter and county officials said there have been dozens of 
calls about adopting the animals since the county announced it was 
taking over thursday 
linda lewis who has worked at the shelter for seven years said 
officials were likely to find homes for only 200 to 300 of the 
animals francine a mutt who is missing her two back legs is one 
of the hundreds who would have no home without the shelter she 
said 
shes got a good home here and shes loved ms lewis said

every lebanese president has been able to 
count on one thing trouble and plenty of it 
each of the eight presidents since independence from france in 
1943 has been plagued by violence 
now after 13 months without a president parliament is trying 
to approve a peace agreement aimed at ending the 14yearold 
sectarian civil war and elect a new head of state under its terms 
under an unwritten covenant accepted in 1943 when lebanon 
gained independence from france presidents have been christians 
prime ministers sunni moslems and parliament speakers shiite moslem 
the first president was bishara khoury a frencheducated lawyer 
and leader of the christianmoslem national resistance against the 
french who had governed under a league of nations mandate since 
1920 
he was in a french prison in southeast lebanon rachaya castle 
built by crusaders when parliament elected him on sept 21 1943 
and was driven from his cell to the presidential palace in beirut 
five years later parliament approved a new constitution under 
which he was elected for a second term of six years 
in 1950 the syrian social nationalist party staged an armed 
revolt aimed at making lebanon part of a greater syria the 
leftist party advocates union of lebanon syria jordan pre1948 
palestine iraq kuwait and cyprus 
khoury and his sunni prime minister riyad solh suppressed the 
revolt in two weeks and party leader antoine saadeh was executed a 
year later three members of the party assassinated solh while he 
was visiting jordan 
in 1952 khoury sought to amend the constitution so he could 
serve another term but was unsuccessful and relinquished power to 
a transitional military government under gen fuad chehab the army 
commander 
parliament elected camille chamoun a former ambassador to the 
united nations as president sept 22 1952 
chamoun faced a moslem revolt in 1958 inspired by the radical 
teachings of gamal abdul nasser then egypts leader he asked for 
us help and president eisenhower sent 10000 marines 
during a long political career chamoun survived at least four 
attempted assassinations he died of natural causes in 1988 as had 
khoury in 1962 
chehab still army commander was elected by parliament 
unanimously to succeed chamoun in 1959 his powerful military 
intelligence branch ruthlessly crushed a new years eve coup 
attempt by army officers who belonged to the syrian social 
nationalist party 
he was followed in 1964 by his protege charles helou a lawyer 
during whose term yasser arafats palestinian guerrillas built 
their power base in lebanon 
that led to the first major israeli attack on beirut 
helicopterborne paratroopers landed at the airport and blew up 10 
jetliners of middle east airlines lebanons national carrier in 
1968 
in 1969 the lebanese army fought arafats guerrillas in south 
beirut nasser of egypt intervened on behalf of arafat and the 
guerrilla presence in lebanon was secured 
suleiman franjieh a maronite catholic warlord and close friend 
of syrian president hafez assad succeeded helou in 1972 his term 
was marked by clashes between christians and palestinians that 
started the civil war in april 1975 
franjieh asked for syrian military intervention in 1976 to keep 
the palestinians and their leftist and moslem allies from

shaken by anonymous letters containing 
racial slurs and threats against blacks students at a small 
liberal arts college said friday they plan a campus march of 
solidarity against racism 
handwritten letters addressed to macmurray colleges 35 to 40 
black students and the schools only black faculty member were 
found thursday in their campus mailboxes 
the letters included racial epithets such as uncle tom and 
made personal slurs tailored specifically to recipients one letter 
threatened watch your back nigger 
edward mitchell president of the 620student college called 
the acts intolerable and promised to expel any student 
responsible at a news conference held by college officials 
students said they would march monday from the campus center to the 
college chapel where white black and hispanic students would 
speak against racism 
we have decided that we wont talk about who is to blame 
said ricky bragg a black sophomore majoring in political science 
thats useless we have simply decided we are going to come 
together and we are going to fight this as macmurray students 
the citys police chief tom weeks said investigators 
interviewed students and staff at the college but had no suspects 
the letters were being examined for fingerprints weeks said 
just having the fingerprints isnt going to tell us much 
unless we have a suspect he said 
the letters apparently were left at a mailroom at the campus 
center where employees unwittingly placed them in mailboxes 
school officials said 
jacksonville is a city of 20000 people in western illinois 
about 85 miles north of st louis 
only a few students actually saw the letters before they were 
removed from mailboxes the officials said black students who saw 
the letters said they were addressed to students by name and campus 
mailbox number 
if you were overweight he called you a fat bitch and stuff 
like this said desmond williams a junior majoring in business 
administration 
each note had something that pertained to you personally so 
obviously there was a great deal of time and effort put into 
preparing these he said 
williams said his envelope contained letters cut from a magazine 
or newspaper to spell the word nigger 
black students met thursday night 
we have some students that have obviously experienced racism 
elsewhere and are very defensive about the issue and are ready to 
take action but i think the levelheaded students are trying to 
keep them in line as much as possible said laura jordan a black 
senior majoring in music education 
the colleges only black faculty member assistant football 
coach gerald young also received one of the letters he said the 
incident doesnt reflect broader racism on campus 
i think that is the work of a small group of individuals if 
not one person he said i think we did the right thing by 
immediately addressing the problem and bringing it out to the 
public

the most senior british official in northern 
ireland hinted on friday that britain may be prepared to talk with 
the irish republican armys political wing if the ira ceased its 
campaign of violence in the province 
in an interview with press association the british domestic 
news agency to mark 100 days in his new post as northern ireland 
secretary peter brooke raised the prospect of direct government 
talks with sinn fein the iras legal political front for the 
first time in 14 years 
protestant leaders in northern ireland reacted angrily and 
britains opposition labor party said brookes comments would only 
help the extremist paramilitary organizations there 
acknowledging that it was difficult to envisage a military 
defeat of the ira brooke said he hoped a british government 
would be imaginative in how it responded if the ira agreed to 
stop its guerrilla activities 
if in fact the terrorists were to decide the moment had come 
when they wished to withdraw from their activities then i think 
government would need to be imaginative in those circumstances as 
to how that process should be managed brooke said 
there has to be a possibility that at some stage that debate 
might start within the terrorist community and that moment might 
come 
sinn fein president gerry adams welcomed what he called the 
conciliatory tone of brookes comments but said no discussions 
could materialize if britain laid down preconditions 
the last direct talks between ira representatives and british 
officials in 1975 led to a brief ceasefire 
the ira outlawed in britain and ireland is fighting to oust 
the british from northern ireland and unite the 
protestantdominated province with the roman catholic irish 
republic under a leftist administration more than 2700 people 
have been killed in 20 years of political and sectarian strife 
in dublin the irish government said it discussed the 
implications of brookes comments at a regular cabinet meeting 
friday but made no immediate response 
northern irelands protestant leaders tore into brooke 
legislator ken maginnis said that before any talks protestants 
would want more than a ceasefire we would want a declaration 
that the ira as a military organization had ceased to exist 
kevin mcnamara labors spokesman on northern ireland said 
his comments can only assist the one last push mentality of the 
paramilitaries on both sides mr brooke has conveyed the wrong 
message he has to make it clear that no one can force their way to 
the negotiating table by violence or the threat of violence 
brooke reiterated comments by his predecessor tom king and 
senior british military officials that it might not be possible to 
defeat the ira militarily 
it is difficult to envisage a military defeat of such a force 
because of the circumstances in which they operate though the 
security forces can exercise a policy of containment to enable 
broadly speaking normal life to go on within the province he 
said 
the northern ireland office which is responsible for 
administering the province said in a statement that brookes 
comments reflect no change in government policy on terrorism 
sinn fein supports violence and ministers will have no 
dealings with it it said 
the government maintains its determination to defeat terrorism 
in whatever form and from whatever source it comes ministers 
continue to seek constructive discussions with and between 
political parties who reject violence

fought for weeks against allowing hewes to appear theres going 
to be a lot of distraction because we have someone involved who has 
no chance of being mayor 
giuliani a former federal prosecutor laughed off the 
suggestion that he needs a knockout punch in the facetoface 
meetings i hope to be able to explain to the people of this city 
that im the one who offers fundamental change he said 
giuliani would not say whether he would focus on dinkins 
financial irregularities as his television advertisements have 
i dont know how hes gonna behave said dinkins i think 
there ought be a discussion of the issues 
at the waldorfastoria mrs bush played up giulianis 
crimefighting image

enough to rid our streets of corrupt officials and vicious hoodlums 
who are robbing our children of this city of their future she 
said at the luncheon

jewish community dinkins from a coalition of 92 rabbis whom he 
dubbed his rabbinic cabinet and giuliani from 70 leaders of 
jewish organizations 
giuliani had held a 12point lead two weeks ago among jewish 
voters according to a new york newsday poll but the two men were 
even among jews in polls released last week jews make up about 18 
percent of the voting public in the city

the leader of a leftist guerrilla group 
that signed a peace agreement with the government said friday his 
fighters will surrender their weapons in cali next month 
carlos pizarro leongomez commander of the april 19 movement 
said the rebels will give up the weapons dec 16 to the 
international red cross at the main square in cali 175 miles 
southwest of bogota 
the april 19 movement also known as m19 is the only one of 
colombias six leftwing guerrilla groups to sign a truce with the 
government it takes its name from the date of the 1970 
presidential election that the rebels claim was fraudulent 
pizarro made the statement in a televised interview on the 
channel 9 news program 
the initial truce was signed last month at the guerrilla base 
camp about 50 miles south of cali 
there was a ceremonial signing of the peace agreement thursday 
night at the congress building in bogota on monday there will be 
another ceremonial signing at the guerrilla camp 
the government has agreed to give the m19 guerrillas amnesty 
and promises to assure them of up to 16 seats in colombias 315 
member congress in future elections 
m19 has claimed to have up to 5000 combatants but it 
apparently has been decimated by fighting with the army and by 
recruiting problems 
when an associated press reporter interviewed pizarro at the 
guerrillas base during the talks that led to last months 
agreement there were no more than 500 guerrillas at the camp rebel 
leaders said all of the guerrillas had been summoned to the camp 
for the negotiations 
there were a few veterans including ones who said they had been 
trained in cuba and nicaragua and there were dozens of boys and 
girls in their teens 
m19 and the government had tried to negotiate a truce in 1983 
the talks failed but some guerrillas were given amnesty and the 
government allowed them and sympathizers to form the patriotic 
union party 
since the party was organized in 1984 rightwing death squads 
have killed 737 party members including the president 
m19 leaders have said they would form another party separate 
from the patriotic union

a national academy of sciences study raised 
new questions friday about oil drilling off the california and 
florida coasts concluding that existing studies give no assurance 
the environment can be protected 
the report was presented to a presidential task force that must 
make a recommendation to president bush by the end of the year on 
whether he should issue leases for oil and gas exploration at three 
controversial sites 
a panel of the academys national research council said the 
technical and scientific data available on environmental impacts of 
oil drilling at the three sites was found to be insufficient to 
warrant leases being issued now 
robert kallman the task force director told reporters the 
findings would be taken into account but he said he wasnt 
prepared to call the report a setback for drilling nor to rule out 
a possible recommendation that leases should be issued 
the report clarifies some of the issues that need to be 
addressed kallman said suggesting the task force might submit a 
series of recommendations to bush that includes one calling for 
additional environmental studies 
interior secretary manuel lujan chairman of the task force has 
been a strong proponent of offshore oil development 
lujan spokesman steve goldstein said friday that the academys 
report doesnt change the fact that offshore oil development is 
needed to reduce the countrys dependence on oil imports 
rep george miller dcalif called the report a major blow 
to the offshore oil drilling program 
it shows when you put three controversial lease sales together 
under a microscope you find out that the interior department didnt 
have enough information to safely go ahead with them but they did 
anyway miller said 
the science panels findings immediately were embraced by other 
critics of drilling 
florida gov bob martinez said in a statement that the report 
clearly recognizes the risks to the florida keys and other 
sensitive resources if drilling were allowed 
the administration is now on clear notice new oil drilling 
leasing could lead to untold damage to the environment and people 
of california said rep leon panetta dcalif 
the sites off northern and southern california and in the gulf 
of mexico near the florida everglades are among the most 
controversial government leases sought by the oil industry 
environmentalists and many local residents oppose opening the 
offshore tracts because of environmental concerns 
bush put a hold on issuing the leases in february directing the 
special task force to examine the environmental concerns and asking 
the national academy of sciences to examine the technical and 
scientific issues involved 
the scientific panel concluded that the available technical and 
scientific data from each of the three lease sites is currently 
inadequate for decisions to be made about development and 
production of oil and gas resources 
the panel which included experts in marine science 
oceanography and a variety of other disciplines was critical of 
past studies of the lease sites by the interior department and 
raised particular concern about the lack of indepth examinations 
on the effects on local communities 
in some cases information was out of date and at other times 
significant social and economic impacts to communities have 
been ignored the panel said 
among its findings were 
an oil spill in the florida site likely would result in oil 
reaching the coastline within hours and polluting some state 
beaches 
more information is needed to assess the effect of oil 
development on corals seagrasses and other elements of the coastal 
ecosystems near the florida site 
the impact on nearby communities including potential damage to 
tourism has been given too little attention 
john harrington of the university of massachusetts chairman of 
the study group said additional studies could take three to four 
years before adequate information is available to accurately 
determine the impact of exploration and drilling 
the leases involve potential oil and gas drilling on 11 million 
acres of ocean off southern california 67 million acres off 
northern california and 14 million acres in the gulf of mexico near 
the florida everglades

troops used water cannons and tear 
gas saturday to drive off thousands of ferdinand marcos supporters 
who massed at national police headquarters to demand that his body 
be brought home for burial 
marcos president for 20 years was forced into exile in 
february 1986 and died in hawaii on sept 28 at age 72 president 
corazon aquino has refused to allow his body to be brought to the 
philippines 
the demonstrators had permission for an allnight rally outside 
camp crame but would not honor an agreement made by their leaders 
to disperse at dawn 
as the sun rose the remaining loyalists locked arms and jeered 
when military officers reminded them of the agreement and shouted 
go home go home 
two water cannons emerged from the main gate at about 6 am and 
sprayed the marcos loyalists soldiers and police chased groups of 
them down side streets and the fleeing protesters responded with 
stones 
no arrests were reported three news photographers suffered 
minor injuries when they were struck by flying stones 
an estimated 15000 protesters assembled late friday at camp 
crame headquarters of the philippine constabulary the military 
national police the crowd had dwindled to a few thousand when the 
confrontation began 
demonstrators moved to camp crame after a daylong rally friday 
by more than 25000 people capping a 250mile march by marcos 
supporters from ilocos norte his native province that took 11 
days 
it was the largest show of support for marcos since 1986 and 
occurred on the eve of mrs aquinos departure for canada and the 
united states where she hopes to convince businessmen the 
philippines is a stable place to invest 
vice president salvador laurel told reporters at the rally that 
mrs aquinos refusal to allow marcos to be buried in the 
philippines was the worst mistake of her administration 
marcos had lived in hawaii since a civilianmilitary uprising 
drove him from office mrs aquino has refused on national 
security grounds to allow the return of his body or of his widow 
imelda and their three children 
during the rally the crowd cheered wildly when laurel asked 
do you agree that marcos body must be allowed home 
it is now very clear what the people want he declared 
you are a very powerful force the government must follow the 
peoples will if not you know what to do 
police gave permission for the rally to be held at a traffic 
circle in suburban quezon city but refused to let the protesters 
march to military garrisons 
after the rally marchers defied the order and headed toward 
camp crame across a major highway from armed forces headquarters 
and the defense department 
about 200 police blocked the street leading to the camp but 
protesters pushed through police lines and swarmed around the gates 
reporters saw some riot police raising fingers in the v 
sign symbol of the marcos movement marcos supporters chanted 
thank you thank you to the officers 
brig gen rodolfo biazon chief of the manila regional defense 
command agreed to let the protesters remain there until midnight 
laurel and leaders of the new society movement the marcos 
political party later negotiated a formal agreement with biazon 
and local governments secretary luis santos to let the protesters 
stay until 530 am 
in a statement broadcast by promarcos radio station dzec the 
late presidents son ferdinand jr said the demonstration was a 
reaction to the arrogance of the aquino administration 
i congratulate the marchers for their steadfast and courageous 
actions the statement said you show to the world although we 
are a moderate patient people we filipinos will not compromise 
principles 
camp crame was the scene last week of protests by constabulary 
troopers angered by government plans to replace the military 
national police with a civilian force 
maj gen ramon montano commander of the philippine 
constabulary claimed opposition groups were recruiting troopers 
for a new coup attempt against mrs aquino 
the military went on full alert tuesday and is to remain in a 
state of heightened readiness until she returns nov 13 from visits 
to vancouver toronto ottawa new york dallas and los angeles 
several coups have been attempted since mrs aquino took office 
but none has occurred during her frequent trips abroad 
aides said mrs aquino would seek increased investment trade 
and relief from the countrys 28 billion foreign debt on the trip 
to canada and the united states

alexander dubcek the leader of czechoslovakias 
1968 prague spring liberalization that was crushed by soviet 
tanks has appeared for the first time on soviet tv and defended 
his reforms 
clips of an interview with dubcek who is now retired and living 
in the slovak capital bratislava were shown on the leningrad 
television program fifth wheel on monday the foreign ministry 
commented on the program at a news briefing friday 
the clips were taken for a documentary that filmmaker a 
ruderman is making 
dubcek describing for ruderman the aug 21 1968 invasion of 
his country by troops of the sovietled warsaw pact alliance said 
the army came and took the communist party central committee 
with tanks and guns of course thats a very sad recollection 
dubcek said he picked up his office telephone to call 
thensoviet leader leonid i brezhnev but was confronted by armed 
soldiers who ripped out the telephone wires 
one of several czechoslovaks who had gathered outside the party 
headquarters was shot and fell to the sidewalk he recalled 
interspersed in the film were comments by prague citizens who 
denounced the warsaw pact intervention that ousted dubcek and 
installed a hardline communist regime 
dubceks comments were shown on soviet television at a time when 
two other warsaw pact members hungary and poland are going much 
further than czechoslovakias reforms 21 years ago without kremlin 
interference 
czechoslovakias conservative leadership has blocked the reform 
efforts championed by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
dubcek said the 1968 reforms sought to create a society in which 
many different opinions could be expressed freely 
radio television and the papers did not say just what the 
government wanted there were other points of view and some of 
them were extreme he said pluralism was written into our 
program 
dubcek described how he and other czechoslovak leaders were 
summoned to moscow where he was stripped of the partys leadership 
in 1969 and subsequently ousted from the party 
foreign ministry spokesman vadim perfiliev told reporters friday 
that soviet officials did not know ahead of time about the fifth 
wheel program 
its quite evident that this interview youre talking about 
was not in any way authorized officially and this program was not 
known to the authorities before it was aired he said 
appearances of such programs in an impromptu way provoke some 
surprise with us because important political issues are 
concerned he added 
ruderman said dubcek had been reluctant to be interviewed 
because czechoslovak authorities still do not approve of his views

the government acted friday to fill canadas 
legislative void on abortion introducing a bill that would allow a 
woman to end pregnancy with a doctors consent but stopping short 
of abortion on demand 
we must not turn back the clock to a time when womens lives 
were threatened because they could not obtain a legal abortion 
justice minister doug lewis told a news conference 
the bill proposed in parliament in ottawa puts abortion in the 
criminal code it allows the procedure only with one doctors 
consent when a womans physical mental or psychological health is 
considered threatened 
health will be the grounds lewis said in ottawa this is 
a matter between a woman and her doctor 
a doctor who violates the law could face up to two years in 
prison the same penalty could apply to the woman in certain 
limited circumstances such as performing an abortion on herself 
the conservative party official said the fetus right which had 
not been included previously has to be gauged and balanced with 
a womans right to security of her person 
the conservative bill places no time limits on when abortions 
could be performed during pregnancy nor would they be limited to 
hospitals 
officials described the bill as a compromise that takes into 
account the rights of a woman and the fetus but it was widely 
expected that if passed it will face legal challenges which will 
again place the abortion issue before the supreme court 
proabortion groups and opposition parliamentarians objected to 
placing the procedure in the criminal code dawn black a 
spokeswoman for the opposition new democratic party said the bill 
does nothing to improve access and doctors may be reluctant to 
perform abortions because they could face a prison term 
judy kazimirski chairman of the canadian medical association 
said she did not think it will change the way physicians 
practice 
liberal party spokeswoman mary clancy said she preferred a law 
that allows easy access to abortion early in pregnancy and 
restricts the procedure in later stages this bill is a case of 
the government speaking with forked tongue she said 
antiabortion organizations complained that the measure gives in 
to prochoice demands and promised to continue their protests 
canada has been without an abortion law since january 1988 when 
the supreme court ruled that the existing laws stringent 
requirements for approval infringed on a womans rights the house 
of commons failed to approve any of six options before it in july 
1988 
the outcome practically left abortion as a matter between a 
woman and her doctor but dramatic cases in provincial courts last 
summer highlighted the legislative vacuum 
in the most publicized case the supreme court in august struck 
down an injunction obtained by a quebec man to prevent his former 
lover 21yearold chantal daigle from having an abortion 
the bill introduced friday which could pass the house of 
commons by the end of the year represents the first time prime 
minister brian mulroneys government has proposed an abortion law 
mulroney who personally opposes abortion under almost all 
circumstances told reporters thursday like all members of the 
caucus i obviously put water in my wine too were trying to 
evolve a common position that is in the national interest 
paul dodds a lawyer for the campaign life coalition said 
friday its positively outrageous for the mulroney government to 
pretend that this is any kind of compromise 
norma scarborough of the canadian abortion rights action league 
told the globe and mail newspaper of toronto were still kind of 
surprised that they feel there is any need for a bill at all 
in the united states the abortion debate heated up after a 
ruling by the supreme court on july 3 cut back abortion rights and 
allowed states to make abortions harder to obtain foes of abortion 
have proposed new bills or plan to do so in a number of state 
legislatures

president bush ridiculed him as a 
little man in a military uniform but nicaraguan leader daniel 
ortega is a far cry from the image of the average bemedaled latin 
american general 
bush was upset because ortega had announced at a summit called 
to celebrate 100 years of costa rican democracy that he would end 
nicaraguas 19month ceasefire with usbacked contra rebels 
ortega ruined president oscar arias party said bush 
but the lean 43yearold president who made bush see red is a 
survivor and a tough fighter for his cause 
he commands the respect of the others members of the 
sandinista party directorate says carlos guadamuz director of 
the national television station and a former guerrilla companion in 
the sandinista national liberation front 
ortega was organizing urban and jungle guerrilla groups in his 
teens participating in bank robberies to buy guns and food he 
spent seven years in the late dictators anastasio somoza debayles 
prisons 
personally he displays a seriousness that those close to him 
say hides shyness he is a solid 5feet11 far from a little 
man by central american standards he wears a simple olivegreen 
uniform with a redandblack sandinista bandana does not smoke or 
drink jogs five miles a day 
one of his heroes was rigoberto lopez a university student who 
in 1956 assassinated dictator anastasio somoza garcia the father 
of somoza debayle before dying in a hail of bullets himself the 
other is cesar augusto sandino who fought the us marines in the 
1930s and was killed by somoza garcia 
the somozas ruled nicaragua for 43 years ortega has never 
forgotten the marines role in installing them or the support they 
had from the united states 
he was first among equals when the sandinistas in 1979 
overthrew somoza debayle he became head of the junta that took 
over and in 1984 was elected president 
bush calls ortegas government a threat to national security and 
us foreign policy and some nicaraguan politicians agree 
war is his only vocation said virgilio godoy vice 
presidential candidate for an opposition coalition in the february 
1990 elections he has a deep resentment of nicaraguan society 
that reflects his revolutionary youth 
ortega was born nov 11 1945 in la libertad in the 
southcentral mountain province of chontales he comes from a 
middleclass family and attended schools run by the roman catholic 
church 
i knew most of the future sandinista leaders then a priest 
and school principal told the associated press earlier this year 
the ortega brothers were not necessarily good students but they 
were leaders and good athletes 
he grew up influenced by the romantic and heroic verses of 
nicaraguan poet ruben dario the sandinistas were the young rebels 
who wrote and recited poems and read marx in the mountains hiding 
from somozas national guard 
one brother camilo died a guerrilla the other humberto is 
the defense minister 
ortegas opponents see him as a tough pragmatic man who can sit 
down for talks and will compromise when necessary who is not a 
radical revolutionary tied to marxist ideology 
opposition leader and presidential candidate violeta chamorro 
got a promise that her newspaper la prensa would be allowed to 
reopen without censorship ortega has kept that promise 
he and humberto are believed to exercise a moderating influence 
in the directorate of the ruling sandinista party reining in 
marxist ideologues who want to do away with all signs of a 
capitalist economy in nicaragua 
as the war with the contras sapped the governments resources 
and the economy ortega convinced others in the sandinista 
directorate to participate in peace talks sponsored by other 
central american presidents 
the results were agreements calling for dismantling the contras 
in exchange for free elections in nicaragua the sandinistas are 
confident they will win but the whole process has been thrown into 
doubt by contra defiance 
ortega denies that his governments decision to end the 
ceasefire is an excuse to cancel voting set for feb 25 but he 
maintains that us refusal to disband the contras and its economic 
assistance to the opposition are a bigger threat to free elections 
we were tired of turning the other cheek every time he 
said referring to attacks he said were made by contra groups in 
recent weeks

a federal judge ruled friday that the case 
of a former graduate student accused of unleashing a worm 
program into thousands of computers nationwide can go to trial 
a federal judge rejected pleas from the lawyer of robert t 
morris to dismiss a felony computer fraud charge because 
information leaked by the justice department would prevent him from 
receiving a fair trial 
morris lawyer thomas guidoboni contended the justice 
department improperly revealed to a reporter before morris was 
indicted in july that morris had given a statement to prosecutors 
and that the department was considering whether he should be 
allowed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor 
us district judge howard munson said no concrete proof was 
offered to show that morris suffered from the justice department 
disclosures the judge scheduled the trial for nov 29 
in november 1988 a worm program that prosecutors said 
morris created clogged a network of about 6000 computers shared by 
colleges research centers and the military 
it took several days to cleanse the network of the program 
which multiplied out of control overloading memories at such 
places as the national aeronautics and space administration in 
moffett field calif and air force logistics command at wright 
patterson air force base in dayton ohio 
computer industry experts estimated the down time and working 
hours needed to combat the program cost from 5 million to 12 
million 
morris 24 of arnold md became the first person in the 
country to be charged criminally under the 1986 computer fraud and 
abuse act when he was indicted on a charge of gaining unauthorized 
access to computers preventing authorized access to computers and 
causing losses in excess of 1000 
morris whose father robert t morris sr is the chief 
scientist at the national computer security center in bethesda 
md faces up to five years in prison and a 250000 fine if 
convicted 
when the worm was unleashed the younger morris was a firstyear 
doctoral student in computer studies at cornell university but he 
was suspended from the school in may 
he remains free on his own recognizance

concerned to get to the bottom of this

oriano quilici the papal nuncio 
he and archbishop prospero penados de barrios said ms ortiz a 
member of the ursuline order was freed friday morning in downtown

repeated death threats 
ms ortiz taught school in owensboro and hawesville ky before 
coming to guatemala two years ago 
neither the national police in guatemala city or in antigua 28 
miles west of the capital would comment on the case 
since midjuly guatemala has been suffering from a resurgence 
of assassinations disappearances and other violence like that 
which claimed tens of thousands of lives in the late 1970s and 
early 1980s 
huehuetenango was the scene of some of the worst human rights 
violations of that era and remains a zone of conflict between 
leftist guerrillas and the military

for most of renewed violence

been targets of rightist violence in guatemala

her to leave the country 
she did leave for a time after an incident in guatemala city in 
midjuly 
a man she didnt know called her by name took her arm and 
sort of forced her to walk with him while he talked he knew where 
she worked and told her to leave 
a stronger threat came on oct 12 about a month after ms ortiz 
returned to guatemala 
violent words such as decapitated assassinated and 
rape were cut out of the paper and pasted on a paper 
the paper was put under the door of her room at a convent in 
guatemala city 
ms ortiz asked her to keep the letters in case they were ever 
needed as evidence 
the archbishop who led a peace march of 15000 children last 
saturday had said earlier he would ask the government to try to 
locate ms ortiz 
in grants fifthgrade teacher rosella vigil a longtime friend 
and former classmate of ms ortiz expressed joy and gratitude on 
hearing of ms ortizs release 
she said ms ortiz returned to grants for two months this past 
summer and at that time discussed her dedication to the people 
especially her pupils 
she was determined to go back she called them her 
people ms vigil said

two murals condemned by some state 
legislators as pornographic or unsuitable for the capitol won a 
reprieve friday prompting the artist to thank god for jesse 
helms for arousing support for the arts 
but the man hailed as the real hero by arts buffs was house 
speaker joe king who told reporters he would try to prevent a vote 
on his decision to save the murals 
some things you dont put to a majority vote he said 
king said he was angered by attacks by helms the republican 
senator from north carolina on controversial art financed by 
taxpayers 
a pair of giant abstract panels titled twelve labors of 
hercules hanging on opposite sides of the house chamber have 
inspired controversy since they were installed in 1981 
some opponents have claimed to see a depiction of a couple 
engaging in sexual intercourse in one of the scenes others have 
questioned whether the stark blackandwhite murals belonged in 
the ornate baroque house chambers 
the house voted in 1982 to hide the murals behind curtains 
earlier this year king ordered the drapes removed but also voted 
to take the artwork down 
but last month the speaker reversed himself and persuaded the 
house executive rules committee to halt the dismantling process 
that had been scheduled to begin in a few weeks 
republican leader clyde ballard and other critics said theyll 
press for a full house vote when lawmakers convene in january 
kings foes suggested he was was trying to curry favor with the 
wealthy seattle arts community for a possible run for governor in 
1992 
king conceded many house members oppose the panels perhaps even 
a majority but he insisted that if the arts community is given 
enough time to do an education job lawmakers will be won over as 
he was 
educate the legislature we need gentle encouragement not 
stridency king told a rally of several dozen artists and 
supporters sponsored by the artist trust and allied arts of seattle 
michael spafford the seattle artist who painted the 100000 
work told the protesters he wasnt interested in controversy 
i think they are quite beautiful in this building he said 
but i also appreciate the feelings of people who dont like them 
thats ok 
he and others paid wry tribute to helms saying he helped turn 
public opinion against banning works of art 
thank god for jesse helms spafford said talk about a 
greek drama if he hadnt existed he would have been invented 
reacting to a federally supported exhibit that included 
photographs of homosexuals helms tried to get the us senate to 
bar federal arts spending on anything that might be considered 
offensive a watereddown housesenate compromise was reached that 
would establish a panel to oversee federal arts endowment policy 
richard andrews director of the henry art gallery at the 
university of washington said helms put the fear of government 
censorship in the minds of people who wouldnt have given a fig 
about art ordinarily 
andrews said people who claim to see acts of intercourse 
violence against women or racial strife in the work are merely 
projecting their own fears and preoccupations

friday it is cutting off public funds to the communist party by 
jan 1 ending subsidies and tax exemptions that totaled 271 
million in 1989 
state money to the united peasants party and the democratic 
party and to other social organizations also will end jan 1 but 
the government said it will not try to recover past payouts 
the peasant and democratic parties this year ended a long and 
docile alliance with the communists to form a majority coalition 
with solidarity 
officials told a news conference the cutoffs underline 
government determination to stop granting advantages to certain 
political parties and start treating each equally 
communist party spokesman janusz bisztyga was not available to 
comment on the decision his office said 
the strength of political parties and social and political 
organizations should grow out of social support and dues and not 
from any system of privileges said aleksander hall the minister 
in charge of relations with political parties 
he said the solidarityled government of prime minister tadeusz 
mazowiecki recognizes as obvious the right to form new 
political parties and will support constitutional changes to make 
that right explicit in the constitution 
the position marked a sharp departure from the attitude of past 
communist governments which held that all parties were illegal 
except for the three mentioned in the constitution the communists 
the peasants and the democrats 
hall said his office plans to call a meeting of the established 
parties and the scores of new ones that sprang up this year during 
polands sharp turn toward democracy to work out remaining problems 
controversial points include whether a law should be passed to 
regulate the activities of political parties as favored by 
communist legislators and whether political parties should be 
allowed to be active at factories and other workplaces and in the 
army police government offices and courts hall said 
the communist party now has offices at most state enterprises 
functioning in many cases as a shadow management and in recent 
months several instances have arisen in which workers demanded 
eviction of party officials 
direct government subsidies to political parties have been 
blocked for the rest of 1989 and no more subsidies will be granted 
marian dabrowski a deputy finance minister told reporters 
he said tax exemptions to the communist partyowned publishing 
and news kiosk cooperative rsw prasa which has a virtual monopoly 
on newspaper and magazine publishing and sales also will end jan 
1 
subsidies to the communist party in 1989 totaled 54 million 
and tax exemptions given rsw prasa equaled 217 million said

court employees crippled the judicial 
system friday with their third strike of the antidrug war led by 
judges who want guns and bulletproof cars for protection from 
assassins hired by cocaine barons 
a union of judges and court workers said this strike had no time 
limit the first strike lasted a week and the second three days 
also on friday all 42 of medellins federal judges announced 
they were resigning according to the colombian radio network rcn 
they had begun an indefinite strike thursday demanding more 
protection from drug traffickers 
the resignations are not effective unless accepted by the 
supreme court which usually does not accept such en masse actions 
drug traffickers have killed three federal judges in three 
months one just before president virgilio barco declared war on 
the cocaine cartels in august they have shown no sign of easing a 
terror campaign aimed at forcing the government to end extraditions 
to the united states 
a car bomb exploded in bogota shortly before midnight thursday 
killing four people including a child three other small bombs 
went off thursday night and a fourth was deactivated bogota police 
reported 
on friday afternoon two men on a motorcycle threw a homemade 
bomb at a clothing store in medellin and a woman and child were cut 
by glass from windows shattered by the explosion police reported 
they said the terrorists escaped and the victims were hospitalized 
in stable condition 
no one claimed responsibility but security forces assume the 
scores of explosions that began in august are the work of the drug 
gangs the 186 bombings reported have killed 29 people and wounded 
at least 228 
the court strike began in stages thursday after federal judge 
mariela espinoza was shot down with automatic weapons wednesday 
night in front of her home in medellin headquarters of the most 
notorious cocaine cartel

50 riot policemen who tried to clear the street 
no one was arrested and the street was not cleared 
strike banners hung from windows of the downtown building where 
scores of judges have offices 
even the supreme court which never goes on strike said the 
government had been remiss in not giving judges and their helpers 
more protection 
we consider that it is exceptionally difficult to administer 
quick and complete justice under the current working conditions 
the president of the 24member court fabio moron diaz said in a 
statement 
although not involved in the strike low pay is another frequent 
complaint in the court system federal appellate judges earn the 
equivalent of about 500 a month municipal judges 400 and court 
employees 150 to 200 
the national association of court workers which declared the 
strike began months ago demanding bulletpoof vests and cars guns 
weapons training bodyguards metal detectors for offices and even 
devices that detect fumes emitted by dynamite 
union president helmut romero said last month the membership was 
14000 members but news reports said 19000 people were on strike

thousands of east germans crammed 
into the west german embassy cheered freiheit freedom 
when they heard late friday that their communist homeland was 
allowing them to go directly to west germany and some immediately 
headed west 
the estimated 5000 refugees jammed in the embassy building and 
in 30 tents hurriedly thrown up on its elegant grounds shouted in 
joy and flashed vforvictory with their fingers as they got the 
first word on west german radio 
they burst into cheers again when west german diplomats later 
announced the east germans could leave legally by any means they 
liked by simply showing their east german identity documents 
the first private cars and two west german tour buses with about 
100 refugees on board headed toward the west german border at 
midnight friday about an hour after the announcement 
the diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity told 
reporters no time limit was set on the exodus it was not clear if 
this meant the effective removal of barriers on travel to west 
germany for east germans who may visit czechoslovakia without 
permission from their government 
west german officials said many of those in the embassy would 
depart on special trains from pragues liben station saturday 
morning 
west germany said the agreement was reached with east germany 
permitting the third such exodus from the west german mission in 
prague in six weeks 
scores of east germans arriving fresh from their homes turned up 
at the embassy astonished and happy to discover they could already 
leave 
more than 12000 east germans had swarmed across the border into 
czechoslovakia in the three days since their government lifted a 
monthold ban on travel to the country the only land east germans 
may visit without prior permission 
more than 2000 east germans flooded into the prague mission on 
friday alone many voicing bitter disappointment with promises of 
reform from a new communist leader at home 
harried diplomats tried to process the refugees tents were 
erected and staircases filled with people to try to accommodate the 
influx 
the overcrowding apparently forced the latest east german 
agreement to an exodus last month two waves of east german 
emigres left last month on special trains from prague through east 
germany to west germany 
the arrangement announced friday apparently allows the east 
germans to go west without waiting for the cumbersome bureaucratic 
procedure of renouncing their east german citizenship through the 
east german embassy in prague 
this would avoid clashes that ensued in october when thousands 
of east germans tried to board the rail cars going west as they 
passed through their communist nation 
east germanys new leader egon krenz who announced sweeping 
reforms and the resignation of five aging politburo members in a 
national television address friday night apparently was anxious to 
avoid more clashes 
krenz also appealed to his citizens to stay in their communist 
homeland which has lost more than 70000 citizens fleeing through 
eastern europe since august another 101000 east germans have 
emigrated legally to west germany this year 
krenzs predecessor erich honecker had banned travel to 
czechoslovakia to stop an earlier exodus of mostly young skilled 
workers from the communist country 
honeckers ouster and indications krenz might be open to some 
reforms did not sway some of the refugees 
its just the same hardheaded idiots as before said a 
bricklayer from karlmarxstadt whats going to change the 
corrupted socialism in our country is just getting new clothes 
thats all 
youve just got to use an open barn door to the west while you 
can said a 25yearold from leipzig 
some blamed krenz himself for their decision to leave citing 
his comments during a visit to moscow this week that ii is not 
possible to reunite east and west germany 
when he buried any hope of reunification i knew ive got to 
get out said a young father from dresden

an oil drilling ship capsized during a 
typhoon in the gulf of thailand and rescuers sought to learn if any 
of the 97 people aboard were alive a spokesman for the owner 
unocal said friday 
no signs of life were apparent although rescue efforts were 
hampered by 6foot waves and 15 mph winds said barry lane a 
spokesman for the los angelesbased oil company 
ships and aircraft had been searching for the 351foot seacrest 
a panamanianregistered vessel following a severe typhoon that 
swept through the area with 100mph winds and 35foot waves 
the ship was spotted with its bottom up by a unocal vessel 
saturday morning or about 520 pm pst said lane who had 
received news of the sighting from unocal thailand ltd officials 
in bangkok 
theyre in constant radio contact with our ships planes and 
helicopters in the area lane said 
the unocal subsidiary had aircraft and ships searching the area 
which were joined by ships and aircraft of the thai navy and air 
force 
a drilling rig mounted in the center of the ship reaching 60 
feet or higher was stacked with equipment and there was concern 
the ship might have been too topheavy to weather such a fierce 
storm lane said 
we expect to be putting some divers in the water to be looking 
at it but i think theyre a little leery of that because of the 
weather conditions lane said 
unocal officials said the crew included 67 thai nationals and 30 
people from other nations 
just before the typhoon hit the seacrest was in the platong 
field located about 270 miles south of bangkok and the crew was 
preparing to run casing into a recently drilled well a statement 
from unocal said the well was secured as the storm formed 
unocal lost contact with the vessel about 12 hours after the 
storm struck thursday 
the typhoon developed suddenly and the crew of the seacrest had 
relatively short notice lane said 
this actually was a small storm a squall and it escalated 
very quickly into a tropical storm and then a typhoon lane said 
the seacrest is owned by a unocal subsidiary and operated by 
great eastern drilling and engineering co of singapore of those 
on board 77 were great eastern employees one was a unocal worker 
and 19 were from various other oilfield companies 
unocal chairman richard j stegemeier said other company 
facilities in the gulf suffered only minor damage and there were no 
reported injuries unocal had more than 1100 workers offshore on 
46 platforms and 18 vessels at the time the storm struck 
unocal operates five natural gas fields in the gulf of thailand 
that normally produce about 540 million cubic feet of natural gas 
daily the seacrest first went into service in 1978

sandinista troops were airlifted into 
remote mountains and jungles in a sweeping offensive against the 
contras and a rebel source said friday hundreds of contra fighters 
were retreating into honduras 
in san jose costa rica a contra leader said friday that the 
usbacked rebels would not meet next week at the united nations 
with sandinista representatives and proposed the meeting be delayed 
a week 
president daniel ortega on friday instead proposed a shorter 
delay in hopes that honduran government officials also would attend 
defense ministry sources in managua speaking on condition of 
anonymity said fighting was going on in the mountains that run 
from the northern border with honduras to the southeast 
they said the army struck in eight provinces where an estimated 
3000 guerrillas were holed up in small bands the sandinista 
soldiers were flown in by sovietbuilt helicopters 
no information on casualties was forthcoming 
in costa rica a wellplaced contra source said hundreds of 
rebel fighters were fleeing nicaragua and returning to base camps 
in honduras 
our soldiers scarcely have any ammunition and cant confront 
an army as powerful as the sandinistas that is using all of its 
force to annihilate us he said speaking on the condition of not 
being identified 
he said the fighters who have opted to remain on nicaraguan 
territory are under orders to take refuge in the most inaccessible 
areas possible 
the offensive coincided with ortegas announcement that he was 
ending a 19month truce he said he took the action because the 
contras had begun returning to nicaragua from base camps to which 
they retreated in 1988 
one sandinista field commander col roberto calderon told 
government radio on friday that more troops were deployed in the 
present offensive than for a 1988 campaign that helped bring about 
the truce 
a force of 4000 sandinista soldiers were deployed along the 
frontier with honduras in the 1988 push 
the sandinista party newspaper barricada said friday that troops 
backed by helicopter gunships attacked about 500 contras in central 
chontales province it said helicopter troop carriers were being 
used to persecute the criminals in la pinuela and la cusuca 
170 miles east of the capital 
a defense ministry communique said thursday that three rebels 
were killed in el guapote 120 miles northeast of the capital in 
matagalpa province it said fighting in pantasma and plan de grama 
in jinotega wounded seven soldiers 
government forces were reorganizing in northern nueva segovia 
madriz and esteli provinces radio sandino said 
contra military commander enrique bermudez has said his troops 
cut off from us military aid for 21 months will take only 
evasive action 
the contras began returning to nicaragua after ortega and the 
other central american presidents signed an agreement to disband 
and relocate the rebels the contras have not agreed to being 
disbanded 
bermudez says about 6000 of the 12000 fighters in honduras 
have crossed the border us officials put the number of contras 
in nicaragua at about 4000 
the contras will not attend a meeting with sandinista officials 
proposed for monday and tuesday at the united nations said 
wilfredo montalvan a director of the nicaraguan resistance in san 
jose the meeting should be held nov 13 to be able to prepare 
ourselves he said 
later friday ortega said the meeting should be delayed until 
thursday in hopes that honduran officials would attend the 
honduran government has said existing peace accords are sufficient 
and declined to send representatives to ortegas proposed meeting 
un spokesman francois giuliani said the meeting at un 
headquarters will be mediated by officials from the organization of 
american states and the united nations 
a senior un official said privately the agenda will include 
the agreement on disbanding the contras as well as sandinista 
promises for free and fair presidential elections on feb 25 
he said the contras are expected to insist on resumption of the 
ceasefire

an armyfunded research project in which cats 
are shot in the head to study brain wounds was suspended friday by 
louisiana state university medical center amid a congressional 
investigation 
dr perry rigby chancellor of the medical center said the 
general accounting office study of the program was requested last 
spring by us rep robert livingston of new orleans 
he said the suspension was not related to strident protests 
against the project by animal rights groups 
dr robert daniels dean of the school of medicine at lsunew 
orleans said a panel of top scientists from lsu would be assembled 
to conduct its own internal review of the program 
although reviews of all research projects at lsu are conducted 
periodically rigby said suspending the project and conducting a 
more intense internal review could make lsu better able to respond 
to any gao findings 
the report by the gao the investigative arm of congress should 
be released no sooner than december perhaps not until sometime in 
1990 rigby said the schools internal review should take six to 
eight weeks daniels said 
as an institution we take our responsibilities seriously and 
we all feel that any questions about this project should be 
answered to the satisfaction of the scientific community and the 
appropriate government agencies rigby said 
project director dr michael carey didnt attend fridays news 
conference announcing the suspension of the project and the 
internal lsu review 
in the experiment a cat is anesthetized a portion of the front 
of its skull is removed and it is locked into a vise a 
heliumpowered gun then fires a small steel sphere into the cats 
brain from about 31 inches 
the object carey has said is to determine the best treatment 
for brainwounded soldiers 
in a television interview last may he said the experiment has 
shown that a bullet wound to the brain stops respiration but if 
respiration is supported artificially the animal will begin 
breathing again on its own 
the project has brought an estimated 2 million to lsu medical 
center over about the past six years rigby and daniels said 
critics including the physicians committee for responsible 
medicine have said the research is superfluous and have asked 
defense secretary richard cheney to end funding for it 
at fridays news conference neither rigby nor daniels would 
discuss specific findings of the research daniels said he expects 
an article on careys findings to be published soon in the 
journal of neurosurgery 
the two men estimated that about 700 cats have been subjected to 
the experiments all are routinely euthanized but one that 
survived the experiment particularly well was not put to sleep 
rigby said 
a spokesperson for a new orleans animal protection group known 
as animal peace could not be reached immediately friday to comment 
on lsus decision the group and others have harshly criticized the 
experiments

a published report about barney the 
talking dog left some charlotte observer employees speechless when 
callers eager to hear the voluble canine overloaded telephone lines 
at the newspaper 
we certainly underestimated the publics appetite to hear a 
talking dog said tom tozer observer features editor after the 
newspaper ran a story that included a phone number readers could 
call to hear a taped message from the 6yearold dachshund in 
nearby valdese 
the dogs owner mable wiles says the dog has a vocabulary that 
includes im hungry mama yes no and 
huhunnh 
when calls overloaded the observers phone lines the paper 
discontinued the callin late thursday 
the sheer volume of people trying to call barney is filling up 
the trunk lines coming into the observer building said southern 
bell spokesman clifton metcalf on thursday afternoon 
some of the overflow went to mercy hospitals nursing school 
which has two lines with the same prefix as the barney line 
for awhile this morning it was rather frustrating said kim 
rickwood public relations director for the hospital calls were 
coming into our instructors offices they would answer the phone 
mercy school of nursing and people would hang up finally one 
instructor said who are you trying to reach and the caller 
said im calling the talking dog 
tozer said the paper had made copies of the barney tape 
available to local television and radio stations so people can hear 
it 
mike burney of wsoctv said it was a fun thing to air but i 
dont think any of us were overwhelmed by the dogs ability its 
unique but its still a little hard to make a case that the dogs 
actually talking 
ms wiles said the tape doesnt do her dog justice especially 
when he gets down to his bass voice

six weeks after hurricane hugo pounded 
ashore with 135 mph winds mayor joseph p riley jr on friday 
pronounced this historic seaport is back its alive and its 
growing stronger 
as proof riley said 72000 truckloads of debris more than 
twothirds of the wreckage left by hugo have been moved out of 
the city since the deadly hurricane swept ashore on sept 21 
we havent consulted with ripleys but maybe for a community 
of our size it could be a world record the mayor said at a news 
conference 
during an average year the city produces only 17000 truckloads 
of debris such as tree limbs and grass clippings the mayor said 
although one debris contractor is running behind schedule riley 
said all areas of the city will have received at least one sweep by 
cleanup crews by tuesday he said an estimated 30000 truckloads of 
debris remain to be cleared 
for that and other reasons visitors to charlestons historic 
sites may find traveling around town takes a little longer than 
usual 
one of the casualties of the storm was charlestons computerized 
traffic signal system it could be another two months before the 
system is operational riley said 
after debris removal the biggest challenge facing the community 
is repairing housing and roofs the mayor said 
in addition repairs need to be made to a number of parks and 
playgrounds and the city marina 
the gaillard municipal auditorium scene of major operas and 
concerts staged by the spoleto festival usa was heavily damaged 
in the storm repairs are scheduled to be made by march 1 riley 
said 
work on the citys new waterfront park on the cooper river also 
was slowed by the storm two fountain pumps were destroyed and the 
company that manufactures the pumps suffered heavy damage in the 
oct 17 earthquake in northern california riley said

the security council on friday assailed 
the false alarm by south africa that accused namibian 
guerrillas of invading namibia just before national elections 
foreign minister pik botha of south africa said wednesday that 
un peacekeepers radioed each other about more than 600 fighters 
of the southwest africa peoples organization infiltrating from 
oct 23 to tuesday 
un officials in namibia examined transcripts of the radio 
messages provided by south africa and pronounced them forgeries 
that did not conform to the style or content of radio transmissions 
by un peacekeepers 
the security council deplores the false alarm by south africa 
on nov 1 concerning the alleged movement of swapo forces across 
the angolanamibia border said the statement adopted 
unanimously by the 15 council members 
the council expresses its profound concern about this incident 
as well as the potential implications for the elections of the 
initial south african reaction to it 
botha had put south africa put troops on alert and said his 
nation was prepared to take action even if such action delayed the 
unsupervised elections scheduled to begin tuesday 
the security council said it calls on south africa to desist 
from any such further actions 
an estimated 1600 swapo guerrillas did cross into namibia on 
april 1 apparently intending to surrender their weapons to un 
peacekeepers and be confined to base like 1500 south african 
soldiers confined to barracks under un supervision 
however that action violated the southern africa peace 
agreement that called for all swapo fighters to be in bases well 
north of the namibian border 
un officials allowed south africanled namibian police and 
south african troops to meet the swapo fighters leading to off 
clashes that killed at least 273 guerrillas and 23 south african 
security force members 
between april and november south africa raised at least two 
false alarms about impending guerrilla incursions according to 
news reports and un officials 
on tuesday through nov 11 namibians are to vote for a 
constituent assembly that will adopt a constitution for the 
territory of over 13 million leading it to independence with a 
black majorityruled government next year 
south africa captured the territory from germany in world war i 
and has governed it since in 1966 the general assembly canceled a 
mandate from the league of nations allowing south africa to 
administer namibia but south africa continued its rule 
last year south africa agreed to cooperate with the un plan 
for namibias transition to independence when cuba agreed 
simultaneously to withdraw its 50000 soldiers from neighboring 
angola

us and soviet officials said friday that 
they have sponsored a general assembly resolution that they hope 
will put an end to superpower rivalry in the united nations 
the resolution urges nations to settle conflicts peacefully and 
respect human rights the officials said in a joint news conference 
at least one thing is clear today it is an end to 
confrontation said vladimir petrovsky the soviet deputy foreign 
minister 
the resolution urges all nations to obey the un charter and 
use un bodies to settle disputes but offered no specific 
proposals to end conflicts in central america afghanistan 
cambodia or elsewhere 
the intent of the resolution and our discussions now has been 
to establish some general principles of agreement not to come to 
resolution of each and every single issue outstanding in the world 
today said assistant secretary of state john bolton 
the resolution calls on all nations to respect the principles 
of sovereign equality political independence and territorial 
integrity of states and nonintervention in foreign affairs 
it also calls on nations to refrain from the threat or use of 
force inconsistent with the charter which permits only 
selfdefense and to peacefully settle disputes 
nations should adhere to the principles of equal rights and 
selfdetermination of peoples respect for human rights and 
fundamental freedoms cooperation among states 
general assembly resolutions have no binding effect on nations 
but the superpowers have the ability to persuade their allies to 
resolve disputes peacefully when they wish 
perhaps the most important thing about this resolution is not 
its specific language but what it symbolizes as a new beginning at 
the united nations a new spirit of constructive cooperation 
said a ussoviet statement 
bolton said the resolution won support from all nations the 
soviet and united states consulted while drafting it several of 
the governments used word like historic to describe it he 
said 
bolton and petrovsky began meeting in summer to start working on 
the resolution and soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze and 
secretary of state james a baker iii approved it during their 
meeting in wyoming in september 
the resolution will go directly to the whole general assembly 
where passage is certain bolton said

about 500 people marched to the board of 
education building in this southwest ohio town friday to urge 
racial harmony after two teenagers wore ku klux klan robes to 
school on halloween 
the predominantly white crowd of parents and civil rights 
activists asked the board to establish more classes in human 
relations in the talawanda school district about 35 miles 
northwest of cincinnati 
there are prejudices that exist we should do everything we 
can to get rid of this superintendent dennis leone said 
the march from the bethel african methodist episcopal church was 
planned after two students at talawanda high school boarded a 
school bus tuesday wearing klan robes as halloween costumes they 
shouted a racial epithet witnesses said 
when they entered the school other students made racially 
derogatory remarks students and school officials said 
the students were suspended pending a nov 13 hearing principal 
lee schmitt said the school has refused to identify the students 
schmitt said he would consider revising the schools curriculum 
to include more human relations courses about 50 of the high 
schools 1100 students are black 
victoria nash a march organizer who has a son in the districts 
elementary school complained that the school does not offer 
courses in black history and that field trips do not include 
cultural or ethnic events 
derek rohrkamper a senior said he believed wearing the klan 
outfits was a mistake but that the demonstrators overreacted 
the students were going too far but they apologized for it 
and said it was a joke rohrkamper said 
other students said racial tensions have worsened at the high 
school since the costume incident and a separate incident on 
thursday in which students tore down posters announcing the racial 
unity march 
three students were sent home thursday for tearing down the 
posters schmitt said one was suspended for two days he said

have no fear of a reunited germany europeans on both sides of the 
eastwest divide are growing increasingly nervous at the prospect 
of a german giant in their midst

political changes indicated that europeans afraid of the rise of a 
new dominant power on the continent may be more comfortable with 
the status quo of two germanys 
east germanys new leader egon krenz quashed the prospect of a 
reunited germany in the near future when he told reporters in 
moscow that division is an element of our european security

the kinds of reforms that would allow east germans to reconsider

bill to restore norths pension was approved by the senate late 
thursday on a 7817 vote ollie north has been punished enough 
but despite that plea the debate over whether to give north 
back his retirement pay dredged up bitter partisan feelings 
stemming from president reagans efforts with north in a key role 
to evade congressional restrictions and fund the contra war in 
nicaragua 
we are asked to bend the law for someone who broke the law 
said sen tom harkin diowa norths defense was that he was

matt woolstons five weeks of drug 
treatment were spent mostly in a windowless room on a blue plastic 
chair 
they wouldnt let you lean back you had to sit forward with 
your back straight often for up to 15 hours at a time six days 
a week and rap about personal problems he said he didnt see 
the sun for days at a time 
woolston 20 was held for 38 days after his parents placed him 
in kids of greater salt lake a drug and alcohol treatment program 
he said he was coerced into going and was rescued only after 
friends followed a van heading to the host home where he was 
being held and called police 
woolstons 19yearold sister jennifer has filed a 65 
million lawsuit against kids claiming she was held against her 
will she says she escaped once by climbing down knotted bedsheets 
was returned by her parents and a man with a badge who claimed to 
be a policeman and broke an arm and a leg falling in a second 
attempt 
police are investigating allegations of false imprisonment 
unlawful detention and assault the allegations are similar to 
those that closed kids of southern california and kids of el paso 
texas early this year 
w kimball delamare director of the utah kids acknowledges 
that treatment can be severe but so are the ravages of compulsive 
behaviors he says 
were not in the business to make money we invite people to 
come in here our motive is to help kids get straight and live 
successful lives and develop coping skills we want to give 
kids back to their parents 
kids is the third utah tough love program to be investigated 
in a year state officials worry utah is becoming a mecca for 
unorthodox treatment centers that prey on desperate parents and use 
poorly trained peer counselors 
the parents want an answer and prevention even an inoculation 
for these behaviors said wayne holland a division of youth 
corrections investigator who believes utahs religious and cultural 
background tend to allow these nontraditional groups to fill 
that need 
it isnt unusual for parents to place children in a longterm 
program which may take 18 months or more for smoking cigarettes 
or having sex without proper admitting procedures involving 
professionals too often kids who dont really need the treatment 
end up there holland said 
a lot of times these kinds of programs promise miracles and 
when they cant deliver they turn abusive said patricia kreher 
director of licensing for the department of social services 
another group the challenger foundation is fighting for its 
license after 17yearold elizabeth zasso claimed she was kidnapped 
into a 63day wilderness experience aimed at characterbuilding a 
judge ruled that her constitutional rights were violated and she 
filed a 20 million lawsuit the garfield county attorney has filed 
misdemeanor child abuse and witnesstampering charges 
and proctor advocate founder layne meacham faces charges he 
permitted the abuse of a 16yearold girl by peer counselors 
meacham has testified he based his program partly on the teachings 
of the founder of kids 
kids in utah is the nonprofit progeny of kids of bergen county 
nj the subject of abuse allegations since it opened in 1984 
kids now operates only in new jersey which has no licensing 
requirements and utah 
the 3monthold utah programs conditional license has been 
extended to jan 31 and the state is awaiting the outcome of 
jennifer woolstons lawsuit and others contemplated by former 
patients said social services ken stettler 
jennifer and matt woolston were put into kids by their parents 
jennifer and her attorney mary corporon say the reasons for her 
placement are unknown matt was placed in the 18month program for 
drug treatment 
because of the litigation marilyn woolston their mother had 
no other comment but we feel real positive about it and feel it 
is very beneficial to the kids even matt would tell you how he 
benefited 
delamare said patients dont always know whats best and that 
parents have the right to intervene in a life out of control even 
an adult childs adult patients sign a contract and can leave on 
24 hours written notice he said 
matt woolston claims he was coerced into signing a contract 
spent hours a day in rap sessions slept on the floor of a 
locked room with five other patients and was under constant 
surveillance 
delamare said the first weeks are difficult newcomers are 
beltlooped required to constantly lock fingers through the 
belt or belt loops of an older experienced patient when moving 
about in the main compound 
they arent allowed to go to school or to see or speak to anyone 
outside except under the strictest supervision it is a phase he 
said that can last for as long as the patient refuses to 
acknowledge a problem 
jennifer contends she saw patients beaten matt never saw 
beatings but said restraining counselors holding his arms 
and legs while another sat on his chest was common 
delamare said restraining is used only when a patient is in 
danger of hurting himself or others 
matt said it happened when patients didnt do what they were 
told 
then there was the honesty machine four or five of the 
counselors would stand around and scream at you call you a liar 
if they doubted you he said it could go on for more than an 
hour and it didnt matter if you told the truth pretty soon 
youd tell them whatever they wanted to hear 
peer counselors the mainstay of both kids of greater salt lake 
and proctor advocate can see through deceptions they once used 
delamare said kids has 10 fulltime staff for about 75 patients 
eight of those are paraprofessional peer counselors who have 
graduated from the kids program in new jersey 
kreher said the young counselors often are unsupervised and may 
be overzealous their tactics can become abuse when they are 
confronted with behavior or illnesses they may not understand 
the thing that distinguishes these programs from others is 
training or more accurately the lack of it 
these young adults often wielde authority with a heavy hand 
holland said many of the complaints in california and texas 
involved counselors who were patients assaulting patients in a 
lower phase investigators said 
attorney mike mohrman who sued challenger for zasso has been 
retained by several former kids patients considering action 
mohrman believes parents are often blinded by real or imagined 
concerns and said the programs rarely turn anyone away since they 
need the business 
corporon is concerned her suit might focus more on whether 
jennifer needed help than the basic issue freedom she was an 
adult and in our country she is supposed to have the right to 
freedom as long as she hasnt committed a crime it is not a crime 
not to live the way somebody else wants you to

a car from a drawing board to the end of the assembly line 
consumers will find changes coming faster than ever as companies 
react more quickly to the marketplace

safety is high in the minds of todays engineers for tomorrows 
cars the government insists on it beginning with the current 
model year cars must have driverside air bags or automatic seat 
belts for frontseat passengers 
more passive systems will be due for frontseat riders in cars 
for the 1994 model year and later cars also are likely to be more 
resistant to side impacts 
one major change likely in the 90s is in how automobiles are 
powered president bush has laid out a plan to reduce the countrys 
dependence on gasoline as a fuel for cars and trucks 
dwindling oil reserves and concern about the environment are 
prompting research into alternative fuels such as methanol 
ethanol and others and reformulated gasoline 
problems that must be resolved include how to get the same 
power out of a gallon of an alternative fuel as out of a gallon of

cable news network which never has been short on 
ambition is getting the global audience it wants by finding room 
at the inns 
while the atlantabased news channel now is seen in 84 
countries the best chance of catching cnn overseas is in a hotel 
room it still is rarity to see cnn in an average persons home 
outside the united states 
transmitting cnn around the world was one of ted turners goals 
when his turner broadcasting system inc launched the 24hour cable 
network in 1980 the network has gradually increased its audience 
potential and made its latest stride over the summer when it 
arranged to use a soviet satellite for transmissions in that corner 
of the world 
cnn is available in about 600 hotels more than 1 million rooms 
worldwide other major international clients for cnn include 
embassies government offices foreign news services and to a 
lesser extent local cable television systems cnn programming also 
is shown on eight airlines which excerpt segments to show 
passengers on intercontinental flights 
network officials add that cnn is widely pirated and overall is 
available to about 200 million people around the world 
all of the populated areas of the world have the capability of 
getting cnn said bob ross managing director of cnn 
international sales ltd a wholly owned subsidiary of tbs based in 
london 
with the exception of antarctica and the western tip of 
australia the whole world gets it ross said 
though cnn is available domestically in 511 million us 
households the target audience overseas is not the average tv 
viewer ross said in a recent interview 
instead cnn wants to be seen overseas by the wealthy and the 
powerful heads of government business leaders americans who are 
traveling and other assorted vips he said 
what were doing is making cnn the first global realtime news 
medium which will make cnn the network of record for major 
decisionmakers all over the world ross said we will become a 
primary news source for the worlds decisionmakers 
there are numerous obstacles to getting cnn to the worlds 
masses ross said most international transmissions are in english 
the necessary satellite reception equipment is too expensive for 
many people and in many places the government doesnt want its 
people to have easy access to western news reporting 
were not a mass entertainment network ross said we 
dont expect to be watched by a welder who is only fluent in his 
native language 
its easy to imagine though that turner a globetrotting 
champion of peace among nations would want ultimately to make his 
programming available to the widest audience possible 
i think thats teds goal to get cnn to everyone said russ 
barry the los angelesbased president of turner program services 
tbs syndication arm 
barry said tbs is getting inquiries from areas that receive cnn 
which also are interested in receiving other turner programming 
such as the shows on the tbs superstation and turner network 
televisions allday schedule of vintage movies 
the international market is quite active he said 
cnns first international markets were in canada and australia 
in 1983 the network broke into europe in 1985 japan the following 
year south america in 1988 and asia and africa this year ross 
said 
the version of cnn seen overseas has some modifications from the 
us presentation for example in many places it is not available 
24 hours a day but ross said it is fundamentally the same 
it is an american news product and it does reflect an american 
perception of events as objectively as we can but some intrinsic 
perception is american he said 
ralph wenge who anchors cnns daily international hour and 
weekend world report from atlanta said the networks global 
view reflects a growing public awareness of how events thousands of 
miles apart are interrelated 
he said the international elements of cnns programming also 
have contributed to the networks increased respect here and abroad 
the networks increased presence cuts both ways however wenge 
said while most of the response to cnns international work is 
positive some people overseas resent the strong presence of a us 
news operation 
the other side is why should a broadcast network originating 
in the united states come into our countries and tell us whats 
happening in our country wenge said theyd like their own 
cnn

sam mccloud is back hes now a us senator 
but he still has a knack for getting into trouble 
after an absence of 12 years dennis weaver is reprising his 
role in a mccloud movie for cbs 
weaver played the deputy marshal from taos nm for seven 
years in the 1970s mccloud was on temporary duty with the new york 
city police and he drove them batty with his unorthodox ways 
wed been talking about a mccloud movie for three or four 
years weaver said i was doing a new series buck james and 
we couldnt find a story that appealed to me it had to have 
relevance to today mccloud couldnt still be in an exchange 
program 
we made him a senator from new mexico i wanted something to 
parallel my own growth and thats with the environment mcclouds 
pushing an ecology bill if people dont see any other part of the 
picture i hope they see this its a speech i wrote myself of 
course i want people to see the rest of the show it has all of 
the mccloud ingredients 
jd cannon terry carter and diana muldaur are all back in 
the return of sam mccloud which cbs will telecast on sunday 
it was filmed on location in england guest stars include patrick 
mcnee david mccallum and roger rees 
muldaur plays mcclouds girlfriend and in the movie they move a 
little closer to the altar 
in the first script we get married said weaver but that 
was kind of stuck on the end with nothing leading up to it i said 
lets keep this string going just from a practical standpoint 
if the show gets a good rating id like to have the freedom to do 
more 
what brings mccloud to london is the murder of his niece who 
had been working for a chemical company 
all the old instincts come back weaver said i go for the 
funeral we think at first it the death is an accident so 
mccloud starts to investigate and he learns certain people are 
willing to sacrifice lives for profit what happened was my niece 
had stumbled upon something and was murdered then the chief 
suspect is murdered and mccloud becomes a suspect in his killing 
this is our first time to film overseas in the past if 
mccloud went anywhere we went to the back lot i ride a horse in 
london i wanted to get a horse from the guard at buckingham 
palace but they said no so i got a horse from a london mounted 
policeman 
mccloud was weavers most successful starring role in a 
series and the one that really marked his transition for a 
supporting player to leading man 
his first role was in gunsmoke as james arness deputy 
chester goode from 1955 to 64 chester walked with a limp and 
talked with a twang mister dilllon he won an emmy for the 
role in 1959 
in 1964 he briefly starred in kentucky jones in which he 
played a veterinarian next he was a wildlife officer who looked 
after a huge black bear in gentle ben 
three shortlived series followed mccloud they were 
stone emerald point nas and buck james 
weaver also starred in numerous tv movies and such miniseries as 
pearl and centennial 
his son robby weaver is on cbs top of the hill son rick 
produces abcs bl stryker and son rusty is a singer and 
songwriter 
weaver has been spending part of his time lately building an 
ecologically balanced house in colorado and filming a 
documentary about it hes building the house on a 20acre site 
overlooking a stream with mountains in the background 
were building it out of old tires packed with dirt he 
said noting the threefoot thick walls will be covered with adobe 
the electricity will come from solar cells and all water will 
be heated by the sun its built on the principal of a cave itll 
be cool in the summer and warm in the winter the architect calls 
it a huge thermal battery

song titles can come from anywhere newspaper 
clippings billboards figures of speech 
the spin the title track of the yellowjackets eighth 
album evolved from a conversation between bassist jimmy haslip and 
keyboardist russell ferrante 
in the beginning it was just a word one suggesting a web of 
meanings records spinning spinning your dance partner the world 
spinning on its axis the spin soon had musical significance as 
well and was rewarded with a song of its own 
we were working on this piece that the bass was in 34 and the 
rest of the band was in 44 and because of the motion of those two 
rhythms it had kind of a spinning spiraling effect haslip said 
we all just decided to call it spin 
its a metaphor for the earth ferrante said this music 
has particulary grown out of a lot of our experiences touring the 
previous year europe and south america and observing a lot of 
disturbing things 
for a group that calls one of its new songs enigma labeling 
their music is another challenge trickier than the most intricate 
rhythm 
grammy voters have given them awards for rhythm and blues 
instrumental and jazzfusion performance the yellowjackets reject 
both categories especially fusion which haslip dismisses as 
outdated 
theyre not straight jazz either much to the anger of purists 
such as trumpeter wynton marsalis who has attacked groups that 
deviate from the new orleans tradition of king oliver and louis 
armstrong 
the thinking is if its not traditional its no good even 
though youre being truthful about it haslip said i never 
understood the principle behind it i look at art as an open field 
lets go out and see what we can create here 
world music is more like it they see the spin as a 
reflection of sounds as well as sights from their travels over the 
past year 
the globe is shrinking with the communication possibilities 
and technology ferrante said every place we go in the 
restuarants everywhere theyre hearing western music its 
becoming one community 
the challenge is for everyone to see the world as one place 
not this person against that this music against that just seeing 
ourselves as one entity 
unity starts at home for the yellowjackets who have made just 
two changes in personnel since ferrante haslip and drummer ricky 
lawson formed a backing group for guitarist robben ford in 1978 
former tower of power saxophonist marc russo joined in 1985 and 
william kennedy took over on drums the following year when lawson 
left to record with lionel ritchie 
william joined the band prior to the four corners album 
haslip said this is when we changed directions that year we 
were traveling a lot more than we had in the past all that 
traveling and motion so four corners like the four corners of 
the world came out 
a trilogy may sound too pretentious for the yellowjackets 
but four corners politics and spin are tied by the 
groups impressions of national and international events 
politics haslip said grew out of his frustration with the 
1988 presidential election 
for some reason that year opened up a can of worms about all 
political situations he said it didnt just have to do with 
the elections theres the business with the record label the 
manager other musicians everything has some political entendre 
spin came out from paying attention to what was happening to 
us as we traveled around the world focusing in the lens a little 
more 
time spent in south africa also had an impact 
to see the conditions there just see how turned upside down 
everything has gotten economically and enviromentally ferrante 
said you can see things in news or on television but when you 
stare in somebodys eyes its a pretty powerful thing just utter 
hopelessness 
recorded in norway spin combines emotions suggested by the 
colors on the albums cover yellow which haslip noted is used in 
hospitals as a soothing effect red for anger and blue meaning 
sadness the songs were written in the garage of ferrantes 
california home 
its a sanctuary he said theres trees around and a 
little japanese garden sort of out one window well be writing and 
all of a sudden jim wont be around the keyboard or piano i look 
up and jims staring out the window then a moment later hes got 
his inspiration 
when russell finds me staring out the window while were 
recording haslip said thats more like daydreaming thats 
what i do i start daydreaming about stuff and things and how the 
music is affected by that ninety percent of the time i come up 
with images

imagine what would happen if thousands of bright 
but bored nintendo fanatics walkman freaks and tv channel flippers 
went to college and studied computer science 
what would happen is the personal computer of the 1990s a 
blend of 3d television and quadraphonic stereo with the hand 
controls of a video game machine and more speed than carsized 
mainframes of the 1980s 
silicon chips burning through a billion instructions a second 
will be able to surround the user with the sights and sounds of an 
early morning in paris or an erupting hawaiian volcano 
multimedia computers will rival television for attention on 
a tuesday night more importantly experts say they will help 
educate the next generation of videohungry schoolchildren 
a computer is the most patient teacher which is why many 
students blossom when they practice math or spelling on it 
computers of the 90s will simulate a fourlane highway for 
drivers ed or a flask of hydrochloric acid for chemistry 
you could have a tremendous explosion of human knowledge over 
the next decade this could not only accelerate peoples learning 
process but make a boatload of money said william zachmann 
president of canopus research in duxbury mass 
infotainment and other trends in computers are being 
propelled by a ceaseless decline in the price of computing power a 
decline that opens up previously unimaginable possibilities 
cheaper chips will add smarts to things people use every day 
from toasters to the telephone system they will become so common 
that people will stop remarking on them the way people stopped 
talking about transistor radios once all radios had transistors 
in contrast to electricity which is a powerful force of nature 
computing is an abstraction no one ever was killed on a golf 
course by a bolt of computing but computers add capability to 
machinery and in the 1990s they will extend the human reach in 
every field from weather forecasting to sex therapy 
we increasingly call them people amplifiers said earl 
joseph a futurist who heads anticipatory sciences inc in st 
paul minn 
any dependence can be dangerous and the dangers from computers 
range from power failures and accidental bugs in the software to 
maliciously planted viruses and the everpresent threat of big 
brotherism 
computer viruses are the social disease of technology and will 
be combated by limiting things that made computing fun in the 
1980s like sharing software and communicating in networks 
as for big brotherism los alamos national laboratory is 
exploring using brainlike neural networks for voice 
identification that could allow computers to monitor phone 
networks and locate people by the calls they make although thats 
not los alamos intention 
harvard university researchers are experimenting with similar 
machines that recognize faces theoretically they could be used in 
airports and bus terminals to search for enemies of the state 
again not harvards intention 
along with the threat of cold efficiency comes the threat of 
computeraided blunders as with the michigan man who was arrested 
five times after a murder suspect stole his wallet and used his 
identification 
there are two broad dangers massachusetts institute of 
technology sociologist gary marx has said one is that the 
technologies work and the other is that they dont work 
stanford universitys terry winograd tells the parable of a man 
who climbs out on a long limb that starts to shake he has two 
choices to invent an intricate computercontrolled 
limbstabilizing system or to wise up and get off the branch 
too often winograd says people fall in love with technology 
and forget the second option still computers are here to stay 
they will change life mostly for the better in the coming decade 
machine translation of language will help put americans in 
touch with the rest of the world computers already can crudely 
translate printed material and automatic translation of live 
speech is on the way but beware one system in europe translated 
the french nous avions we were having as us airplanes 
telerobots with human guidance will clean up crippled nuclear 
reactors and scour sclerotic arteries unlike their crude 
ancestors they will be able to go about their work without 
momenttomoment instructions one unnerving possibility is 
military robots telegladiators that would lower the 
threshold of war by removing people from the battle scene 
artificial intelligence is not going to create a human brain in 
silicon by the end of the 20th century that dubious achievement 
may lie another century off but spinoffs will be everywhere such 
as an agent that scans data to assemble an electronic newspaper 
tailored to its bosss interests 
computers will continue to take over unskilled jobs societys 
challenge is to retrain those who are displaced to do more creative 
work joseph the minnesota futurist is optimistic 
the shortterm displacement will be horrible but the key word 
is cooperation to make humanistic use of people i think its 
going to be one of the greatest decades

how far can computers be trusted 
the question will become critical in the 1990s as society comes 
to depend even more on computers to monitor nuclear power plants 
fly passenger aircraft count ballots move money around and watch 
out for nuclear attack 
it used to be said that computers do only what people tell them 
to do but that is no longer the case 
the europeanbuilt airbus a320 which will fly and land itself 
is a safe plane that depends on computers for its safety 
pilots can override the automatic pilot but the computer will 
prevent any extreme maneuver that could damage the plane some 
veteran pilots worry the limitation could prevent them from taking 
heroic action to save lives others say the automatic pilot is so 
good that pilots would be unprepared if it ever malfunctioned 
computers contain the most sensitive information about peoples 
lives from diseases to arrest records but they are notoriously 
susceptible to snooping 
a murder suspect was captured in california this year when wells 
fargo bank helped police track him through the locations where he 
withdrew money from cash machines in theory anyone could be 
tracked the same way 
everyone who uses a credit card goes to the bank visits a 
doctor or owes money depends on the personal integrity of data 
entry clerks programmers and systems personnel jane robinett 
of polytechnic university in new york wrote recently in information 
week 
computer viruses are the latest scourge but oldfashioned 
computer theft has not gone away election computers are 
unacceptably easy to break into according to a study by the 
national institute of standards and technology 
things have gone so far that reducing dependence on computers 
would be difficult if not impossible 
in a serious accident at a modern nuclear power plant more than 
100 alarms can go off in the control room at once while dozens of 
red lights flash simultaneously indicating problems with pressures 
temperatures and water levels 
utilities are trying to cope with the christmas tree problem 
with computer systems that will filter out lowpriority alarms and 
identify what they figure to be the heart of a problem 
operators will not have to take the computers diagnosis for a 
fact they can probe deeper to find out the data and assumptions 
that went into it but in a red alert with seconds ticking away 
and catastrophe possibly at hand the person at the control panel 
may well just take the computers word 
and pray that the computer is right

more and more israeli army reservists are 
coming up with a wide variety of excuses to avoid duty in the west 
bank and gaza strip to put down the palestinian uprising known as 
the intefadah 
one reservist identifying himself as joshua a 25yearold 
architecture student said he invented psychological problems 
to get out of serving 
there is a limit to what i will do he said if i killed a 
palestinian kid i dont think i could live with it 
others called up arrive at induction centers on crutches or with 
letters from employers saying they are too essential to the 
business to be let go some claim illness 
it is what israelis call a gray refusal getting out of 
duty without directly refusing to serve which would challenge the 
pride that israelis hold for their army 
some have legitimate excuses others feel their previous combat 
training is wasted on what they view as essentially police work 
still others believe the uprising is not a real military threat to 
israel 
most reservists interviewed said they would not hesitate to 
serve if israel faced a war or some other serious threat 
but nobody feels threatened by the intefadeh said andre 
dreszin a spokesman for the conscientious objectors group yesh 
gvul its not like the egyptian and syrian tanks in 1973 where 
if we didnt stop them they would have made it to tel aviv 
brig gen ehud gross the armys chief education officer said 
61 soldiers had been tried for refusing to serve in the occupied 
territories and he called it an ignorable number 
i do believe that today there is no problem with the 
mission he added there are some refuseniks who decline to 
serve in the territories those are the minority the vast 
consensus is against them 
the newspaper yediot ahronot recently quoted senior army 
officers as estimating the number who avoid service in the 
territories has grown into the thousands 
what is significant about this new phenomena is that it 
includes those who dont usually try to evade service like senior 
officers and guys from elite units said ariela hoffman a 
reporter on military affairs for the newspaper 
virtually all israeli men and women serve two to three years of 
mandatory service starting at age 18 men continue in the reserve 
until age 56 and it is estimated the army can triple its size by 
calling up 370000 reservists within a few days 
since the uprising began in december 1987 seven israeli 
soldiers have been killed including a 28yearold reservist whose 
skull was crushed by a stone dropped from a roof by a palestinian 
at least 600 arabs have been killed by soldiers or israeli 
civilians and 33 israeli civilians also have been slain 
dreszin the conscientious objector who has not been called up 
during the uprising but served 63 days in jail for refusing service 
in the lebanon war said some reservists avoid service by using 
minor illnesses that they would disregard if called up for a real 
war 
they exploit their illness he said they say to 
themselves why should i ignore my medical problems if they help 
me stay out of the territories 
reservists usually receive their callup notices in the mail 
weeks in advance so they have plenty of time to work out excuses 
letters from professors telling of upcoming exams are plentiful on 
callup day as well as those from employers and doctors 
if you cry enough in the army they will say go home just 
to get rid of you you are demoralizing said a 32yearold 
lawyer and father of three identifying himself only as motti 
there are other ways to get out of duty in the territories 
one officer was indicted for accepting bribes from reservists to 
assign them to an easy posting 
yediot ahronot also reported that one man called to duty fired a 
few rounds into the air and shouted were going to kill arabs 
his intent was to have officers declare him too unstable 
among soldiers who do serve in the territories despite 
misgivings some have found their own ways to protect their ideals 
paul 29 a softspoken immigrant from england recently served 
16 days in nablus the west banks largest city but said he 
ignored orders to fire at stone throwers 
some of the guys were shooting at the kids as they got off the 
truck he said i shot at a garbage can

children draw sketches of their homes so 
theyll remember them later their parents no longer repair their 
huts traders dont bother to drum up new business 
harsud is one of 573 communities destined to be flooded in a 
giant dam project that pits environmental concerns against indias 
attempts at modernization 
the government says the 15 billion project on central indias 
narmada river will irrigate droughtstricken farmland and provide 
electrical power 
critics say it will displace a million people and destroy the 
ecology 
what is the use of the dam that will be our doom said 
naginchand sand a local businessman 
in september leading environmentalists and 35000 villagers 
descended on harsud a town of 15000 in a demonstration to 
denounce the dam project as a human and environmental tragedy 
a man who runs a grocery store near sands fertilizer store said 
he had planned to expand his business but after the dam project was 
announced in 1987 all my dreams ended 
a sort of gloom descended on the village he added but 
now with the massive protest there is fresh hope 
the narmada dam project in madhya pradesh state is the largest 
ever planned in the world it envisages 30 major 135 medium and 
3000 minor dams along the 805mile river and its 41 tributaries 
so far three dams have been built 
the river is one of the holiest to hindus according ancient 
belief it was formed by the tears of shiva one of the gods of the 
hindu trinity 
the river originates in a pond 335 miles to the east of harsud 
and courses through lush forests farmland and narrow rocky gorges 
in a series of falls and twists before reaching the arabian sea on 
indias western coast 
about 21 million people 80 percent of them tribespeople and 
villagers live in the narmada basin which is bounded on three 
sides by mountains and on the fourth by the sea 
if the river is dammed 2410 square miles of forests and 
farmland an area slightly larger than delaware will be 
submerged and about 1 million people will be displaced said ashish 
kothari of kalpavriksh an independent environmental group other 
independent groups agree with those figures but no official 
estimates have been made available 
harsud will disappear under 50 feet of water when one of the 
major dams of the project the indira sagar is built 15 miles away 
the government says the dams are necessary to bring an era of 
prosperity to the valley because they will irrigate 20000 square 
miles of land in droughtprone areas of madhya pradesh and 
adjoining gujarat state 
the project is also supposed to generate 2700 megawatts of 
electricity 
as for the people who will have to move the government says it 
has prepared extensive rehabilitation plans including monetary 
compensation 
who wants money i want my land will you feel nice if the 
land that gives you food is drowned said farmer bhure singh who 
traveled 155 miles on the roof of a crowded bus to demonstrate in 
harsud 
kothari of the environmental group said there wont be enough 
land left in the area for so many people to live on if the dams are 
built 
to compensate for forest loss the government plans to plant new 
forests kothari maintained however they could not replace the 
hundreds of thousands of species of plants and animals that may 
have evolved over millions of years 
another objection is the projects 15 billion price tag which 
some economists say is a gross underestimate the world bank has 
promised to lend india 450 million for the project 
gerald fauss a senior irrigation engineer with the world bank 
said a project of narmadas size is bound to create some 
environmental disturbances 
but the tradeoff is that thousands and thousands of people 
benefit from it we still feel that the project is technically and 
economically feasible however vijay paranjpye an economist 
with the governing body of indian universities concluded in a 
study of the project that it is economically not viable

on the hurricanebattered 
island of vieques a practice site for us navy bombing off puerto 
rico residents link their destiny to a centuryold tamarind tree 
on a barren hill 
if the tree survives so will vieques said engineer sixto 
perez after a ceremony to replant the tree which was uprooted by 
hurricane hugo on sept 18 
it has been silent witness to our history nana ortiz de 
castano a retired teacher told schoolchildren gathered around the 
tree 
the us navy has been part of vieques history since world war 
ii 
it owns twothirds of the island and uses it for practice 
bombings and maneuvers in the 1970s vieques was rocked by violent 
antinavy protests similar demonstrations in 1975 drove the navy 
off its sister island culebra although the navy says relations 
have improved in recent years many viequenses as the 8000 
residents are called say hurricane hugo has made matters worse 
vieques was one of the areas hardest hit by the storm 
hugo pounded vieques for 12 hours with winds clocked at 140 to 
200 mph demolishing or damaging virtually all its 3000 homes 
trees were either knocked downed or defoliated leaving the 
onceverdant sunsplashed island with little shade 
it will take 10 years to recover said luiz davila manager 
of a general electric plant that makes electric switches and is the 
islands largest employer with 132 workers 
now we are seeing the devastation davila added in six 
months a year we will see the lack of income people will have 
with their homes and possessions gone and their future 
livelihood in doubt some residents despair officials say two 
people hanged themselves and several others attempted suicide after 
the storm no one in vieques died in the hurricane itself 
there is lot of depression a lot of suicide attempts said 
dr eva almodovar who is in charge of the emergency room at the 
vieques hospital its people who have lost everything they 
dont see a way out 
the navy is helping rebuild roads and restore power and water 
the day after the hurricane the navy put up a roadblock to 
prevent squatters from returning to a disputed area where they had 
set up shacks and burned two navy vehicles in april 
robert ravin a high school history teacher charged that the 
navy acted like thieves in the night taking advantage of the 
hurricane crisis 
but a navy spokesman lt richard boyle said the roadblock was 
put up because the squatters were unauthorized people on navy 
property the shacks had been blown down and were completely 
demolished 
the navy bought vieques land for training during world war ii 
resettling residents in the center of the island which is 20 miles 
long and six miles across most of the navy property is unused and 
hundreds of squatters have moved in over the past year 
rear adm john a moriarty commander of caribbean naval forces 
said relations with vieques residents have been very very good 
but squatter organizer antonio figueroa a carpenter who says 
his movement is rescuing land believes the navy has a master 
plan to stifle development to keep the island to itself 
many viequenses complain that the navys presence has kept the 
island underdeveloped underpopulated and povertystricken 
vieques has a severe housing shortage an unemployment rate of 
70 percent and an annual per capita income of 5281 as opposed 
to the puerto rico average of 8721 the majority of the islanders 
are on welfare 
although its unspoiled beauty has made it the location for 
several movies most recently heartbreak ridge with clint 
eastwood about the 1983 usled invasion of grenada vieques has 
seen little tourism 
the navy occupies twothirds of the island and this prevents 
it from developing to its plenitude because they own the best 
beaches the best land said mayor manuela santiago collazo 
vieques has been losing population for years and is expected to 
lose 2000 of its 8000 inhabitants by the year 2000 
a young viequense who becomes an engineer a doctor or a 
lawyer cant come back because there is nothing to do here said 
figueroa

president bush is paying a nostalgic visit to 
andover the massachusetts prep school where he stood out half a 
century ago in athletics and student life and forged friendships 
that have lasted a lifetime 
bruce gelb recalls his own arrival at andover in 1941 as a 
freshman and swiftly found himself ordered by a campus bully to 
lug a big overstuffed chair across the campus 
gelb managed to heft the chair down a flight of stairs and to 
the lawn outside but then i just couldnt move it anymore 
he put my hand behind my back in that typical kind of 
hammerlock gelb recalled last week in an interview just then 
a guy walked by and very simply made the statement leave the 
kid alone he the bully dropped me like a hot potato and snarled 
something and picked up the chair and walked off 
i asked somebody who was that guy and they replied that 
was poppy bush 
i never met him i never said a word to him gelb said but 
naturally he became my hero 
bush and his wife barbara will take part in a convocation 
sunday marking the 200th anniversary of the day the first 
president george washington paid a brief visit to phillips 
academy the formal name for the prestigious school known to 
generations as andover 
the ceremony on the schools great lawn will have a religious 
and international cast starting with a procession of students 
bearing flags from the more than 50 nations represented in 
andovers student body of 1217 it also will include ecumenical 
readings by students in several languages including a soviet boy 
and a black south african girl 
the president and his wife will read from the 24th and 33rd 
psalms as they take their place with the others on the campus that 
was so familiar to bush nearly five decades ago 
in bushs day the school in andover mass was among the 
oldest and most elite of new englands boarding schools a way 
station to yale and other ivy league colleges and alma mater to 
such famous americans as oliver wendell holmes and samuel morse 
the school was allmale and almost all white then now nearly 
half the students are women and 13 percent are black or hispanic 
the boy everyone called poppy is still remembered by 
oldtimers for his prowess on the playing fields and the leadership 
qualities that made him senior class president captain of the 
baseball and soccer teams and chairman of the student deacons at 
chapel services 
he was not a very good english student recalls retired 
teacher hart leavitt 
but in the school itself he was quite a figure what was known 
in those days as a bmoc big man on campus said leavitt who 
taught for 37 years at andover before retiring 
bushs credits in the 1942 andover yearbook pot pourri 
list more than two dozen activites in the senior class poll he 
was rated as having the secondmost drag or pull with the 
faculty and third in five categories best allaround fellow most 
respected most popular best athlete and handsomest 
he didnt place in the listings for class politician 
headmaster donald w mcnemar will not disclose bushs grades 
but said he did fine 
tough discipline was a hallmark of the old regime for instance 
bruce gelb was tossed out as a junior for an infraction 
never mind he went on to become a top executive of bristol 
myers corp and a major fundraiser for bushs political 
campaigns this year bush made gelb director of the us 
information agency 
bush spent five years at andover entering with the class of 41 
but finishing with 42 because of an infection that left him 
hospitalized 
the united states was at war when bush graduated and he 
enlisted the day he turned 18 the futrure president ignored 
commencement advice from secretary of war henry stimson the head 
of andovers trustees who said the war could be a long one and 
graduates could better serve their country by getting more 
education 
bush the navys youngest pilot flew 58 combat missions and 
survived being shot down records show that 143 andover alumni were 
killed in world war ii

as president bush envisions it his floating 
chat with mikhail s gorbachev will carry a builtin guarantee 
with no agenda to be met and no deals to be settled the meeting 
can hardly be judged anything but a success unless somebody jumps 
ship 
while both leaders are supposed to be committed to staying 
aboard with an informal freeform format the soviet side does 
seem to have some bigger ideas suggesting the meetings dec 23 
might end the cold war 
thats rhetoric but it collides with the white house effort to 
keep the profile of the nonsummit summit just above the water 
line bush and his spokesman want expectations held to a minimum 
at the last superpower meeting comparable to this one gorbachev 
startled ronald reagan by proposing drastic cuts in nuclear 
weapons the administration doesnt want a replay 
bush who issued the handwritten invitation as he flew home from 
eastern europe on july 18 said that he thinks the meetings will be 
productive but that nobody expects substantial decisions or 
agreements to emerge 
by those ground rules both leaders could go ashore declaring 
they have met their objectives done what they came to do for 
both that would help at home 
bush already is using the meeting he initiated in rebuttal to 
the critics who say he has faltered in dealing with the political 
and economic upheavals in eastern europe and the soviet union 
gorbachev is grappling with economic crises at home and with the 
drastic changes that are turning what were satellite states toward 
democracy and freer enterprise even a general assurance of 
economic cooperation and a hint that trade restrictions could be 
relaxed would be a lift as he heads into a difficult winter so 
will the stress on foreign affairs and superpower relations strong 
points in contrast to the budget woes food shortages unemployment 
and strikes besetting the soviet economy 
bush said he expects a lot of discussion of the dramatic changes 
in eastern europe in poland hungary czechoslovakia and most 
recently east germany in a way that is a breakthrough for 
nearly 45 years soviet leaders considered eastern europe their 
business not a topic for a summit discussion now gorbachev may 
want some assurance that the west will not push too hard or seek 
strategic military advantage in what is happening there 
indeed bush said the rapidity of change in eastern europe was 
one of the things that led him to change his mind about the right 
time and format for his first presidential meeting with gorbachev 
i just didnt want to in this time of dynamic change miss 
something something that i might get better first hand from mr 
gorbachev he said tuesday as he announced the meetings 
nevertheless there are risks in an unstructured meeting of 
superpower leaders even to get acquainted 
there are those who hold that the soviet miscalculations behind 
the 1962 cuban missile crisis took root when nikita s khrushchev 
and president john f kennedy met in vienna austria in 1961 
bush and gorbachev have met before most recently when bush was 
presidentelect but since then and until the surprise 
announcement last tuesday bush had said he wasnt going to rush to 
the summit and didnt want to meet for the sake of meeting next 
years arms control summit was arranged in september 
when reagan met with gorbachev at reykjavik iceland just over 
three years ago in what was supposed to be a preliminary meeting 
to an arms control summit the two leaders wound up talking about 
elimination of all nuclear weapons then quit in discord over the 
us space defense program 
bush dismissed any comparison with iceland saying this isnt to 
be an arms control meeting or a summit at all that comes next 
spring or summer in the united states 
but when the superpower leaders meet it is a parley at the 
summit in winston churchills phrase no matter what anyone wants 
it called and such a meeting creates unavoidably the pressure of 
expectations that the two presidents will come away having 
accomplished something more than a meeting 
summits take on a definition an expectation of grand design 
and grand agreements and thats not what this is bush said he 
said the shipboard setting will cut down on the fanfare the 
pressures the crush of people 
but all those trappings go with a summit and this one will have 
them no matter what its called theyll just be a little farther 
away in port while the two presidents are talking during their 
weekend at sea 
thats as inevitable as the expectation of measurable progress 
at least of momentum toward grand agreements at the summer summit 
next year

governors office in new jersey 
the heightened concern over abortion stems from a supreme court 
ruling last summer permitting states to impose greater restrictions 
on women seeking to terminate their pregnancies and already the 
two parties are debating the political fallout 
ron brown chairman of the democratic party said abortion has 
had an impact on the virginia new jersey and new york races and 
added that democratic candidates with their prochoice views are 
on the right side of the issue 
i think president bush has dug himself a big hole that hes 
going to be unable to extricate himself from he is taking a lot of 
republicans down with him brown said 
countered gop chairman lee atwater without referring to any 
individual gop candidate where you get into trouble on abortion 
is when you do not clearly define your position when you appear to 
be all over the lot on it 
atwater who managed bushs successful 1988 campaign noted that 
bushs opposition to abortion did not damage him last year 
in other balloting tuesday 11 candidates are vying to replace 
rep mickey leland of texas killed last summer in a plane crash in 
ethiopia 
the lineup of big city elections includes detroit where 
71yearold democrat coleman young seeks a fifth term and 
cleveland where democrats george forbes and michael white are 
staging a bareknuckled political brawl for city hall 
john c daniels is favored to win office as the first black 
mayor in mostly white new haven conn while norm rice is out for 
the same honor in seattle against republican norm jewett 
dozens of referendums dot election ballots including in san 
francisco where voters will decide whether to spend 115 million 
to replace the citys windswept baseball and football stadium 
candlestick park 
in a campaign prelude to 1990 elections with 34 senate seats 36 
governorships and 435 house seats abortion has become a prominent 
issue 
the issue was cooler before the supreme courts ruling 
atwater said but added i maintain it is not going to be a 
national driving issue in 1990 its going to be an issue on a 
racebyrace basis 
bush has campaigned personally for gop candidates j marshall 
coleman in virginia rudolph giuliani in new york and rep james 
courter in new jersey including a swing into new jersey and 
virginia on friday he talked of drugs crime and other 
challenges of tomorrow but steered clear of abortion 
but a sweep by democrats wilder dinkins and florio leaders in 
late preelection polls would give their party plenty to cheer 
about one year after bushs 40state landslide victory 
nowhere is abortion more clearly or more surprisingly an 
issue than virginia where race was scarcely a factor until the 
campaigns final days 
wilder challenged a decade of political wisdom by taking the 
offensive with commercials on abortion on television where 
prochoice and righttolife groups have both spent heavily on 
commercials as well the issue has spilled over to at least one 
other race 
wilder launched television commercials more than a month ago 
telling women that coleman wanted to take away your right to 
choose he wants to go back to outlawing abortion even in 
cases of rape and incest 
larry sabato university of virginia political scientist said 
wilders approach permitted him to gain support from voters who 
oppose government intervention in their lives and combine the 
antigovernment conservatism with his liberal base and its a 
potent combination 
coleman declined to respond at first instead charging his 
democratic rival with trying to spread fear 
but wilder surged to a lead in public opinion polls within a few 
weeks leaving coleman a former attorney general who lost a 
gubernatorial bid eight years ago to play catchup in the final 
weeks of the race he hit back with commercials questioning 
wilders suitability to serve and on friday raised the issue of 
race by implication when he said wilder was benefiting from a 
double standard in press coverage 
abortion has surfaced in greater and smaller degrees in other 
races 
courter has softened his antiabortion position in new jersey 
and thus alienated the national right to life committee which 
hasnt given him its backing courter has made so many different 
statements on abortion i would like to know what his position is 
says spokeswoman nancy myers democrat florio has a solid 
prochoice position 
giuliani softened his position as well in the new york race 
arousing the ire of roman catholic cardinal john oconnor the gop 
candidate issued a clarification last summer that said he accepted 
a womans right to choose and would oppose making abortion illegal 
the issue spilled over to the lieutenant governors race in 
virginia where republican edy dalton aired a television commercial 
saying she was in favor of a womans right to choose in cases of 
rape and incest democrat don beyer said that misrepresented her 
true antiabortion colors 
the national abortion rights action league is investing more 
than 300000 in television and newspaper advertisements in 
virginia hoping to help wilder 
the national right to life committee says its spending about 
150000 on its own virginia ads touting coleman but complained 
friday that about half of the stations in the state had refused to 
accept them 
and even before the 1989 returns are read the 1990 handicapping 
has begun 
if were able to frame the debate in terms of who decides 
about abortions that is the politicians or the women then 
well win said tony podesta whose company has prepared the 
television and newspaper commercials being used by naral 
but sabato the political scientist believes the importance of 
abortion has been overrated in virginia and said its wrong to 
assume this is easily translatable 
he said virginia had a relatively small number of catholic and 
ethnic voters the groups who might be offended by wilders 
position on abortion and that candidates in other states risked 
greater damage by following his example

investor saul steinberg is unlikely to lead a 
takeover bid for ual corp parent of united airlines but he could 
play a big supporting role in the next act of the ual buyout saga 
industry analysts said 
steinberg who is said to be a close friend of ual chairman 
stephen wolf took center stage wednesday when his reliance group 
holdings inc filed for federal antitrust clearance to buy more 
than 15 percent but less than 25 percent of uals stock 
such a request often signals that the petitioner seeks an active 
role in the target company and usually a measure of control but 
because of his association with wolf analysts said thursday that 
steinberg probably was positioning himself to help uals chairman 
attempt another buyout or a restructuring

jaguar plc has gone through ups and downs since it 
was launched in 1922 as the swallow sidecar co in blackpool 
swallow introduced its first car in 1927 and a year later moved 
to coventry the center of the british car industry 95 miles 
northwest of london 
it produced a line of cars under the ss brand in the 1930s and 
changed its name to jaguar cars ltd at the end of world war ii in 
1968 it became a part of the stateowned automaker british leyland 
jaguar fared badly under state stewardship it suffered an 
aftertax loss of 84 million in 1980 and developed a poor 
reputation for quality control 
jaguar chairman sir john egan who took over nine years ago 
largely is credited with turning jaguar around by cutting costs 
more than tripling production per worker and expanding sales in 
europe and the far east 
the government sold jaguar to the public in 1984 and jaguar soon 
was hailed as a prime example of a successful privatization along 
with british airways plc and british steel plc 
but jaguar remained overly dependent on the extremely 
competitive us market where it still sells 40 percent of its 
cars and it was clobbered when the dollar and us luxury car 
sales slumped 
jaguars aftertax profit peaked at 141 million in 1985 it 
sank to 99 million in 1987 and then to 46 million in 1988 on 
revenue of 107 billion analysts are expecting jaguar to lose 
money in 1989 
jaguar has a small product range it produces 50000 xj6 and 
series iii sedans xjs sports cars and limousines a year its 
cheapest model is 39700

the cheapest model costs nearly 40000 and 
customer satisfaction isnt part of the allure but the curvaceous 
jaguar decked out in leather and walnut has a mystique that sells 
the announcement thursday of ford motor cos 25 billion deal 
to buy the british automaker puts an ironic twist on the story of 
jaguar whose owners traditionally have eschewed dependability for 
the guaranteed style of the leaping cat logo 
jaguar is the burberry of the car industry said john 
lawson a london auto analyst 
despite nagging criticisms about how well the cars actually run 
jaguar retains a certain cachet that symbolizes british elegance 
and the lifestyles of the rich and famous 
people buy them for sentimental reasons said paul horrell 
at britains car magazine they are as quiet as you can buy 
including rolls royces and it is very traditional british you 
feel like youre walking into a gentlemens club 
prince charles has owned a jaguar and in the golden age of 
hollywood clark gable had at least one 
in the united states jaguars biggest market with sales of 
20000 annually the affluent image was fostered by glitzy 
primetime soap opera stars behind the wheel 
the nasty cliff barnes drove an sj6 along the road to southfork 
in dallas others followed suit with jaguars driving through 
dynasty falcon crest knots landing and la law 
episodes 
britains national motor museum displays three jaguars and 
curator michael ware said much of the companys prestige hinges on 
racing successes especially at the french le mans race where the 
companys most recent win was in 1988 
that was the first time jaguar had come out on top of the 
24hour endurance race in 31 years and britains daily telegraph 
newspaper noted the significance if the rise and fall of the jag 
was a microcosm of british industry then the symbolism of the 
comeback is writ large 
british car industry experts who pronounce the word with three 
syllables jagyooahr advised ford not to tamper with the 
companys refined image 
but in a recent survey of us customer satisfaction by jd 
power and associates jaguar failed to make the top 15 two years 
ago in a similar study the company ranked eighth 
stephen reitman an auto analyst with the london investment firm 
ubs phillips and drew said jaguar is not as technically advanced 
as japanese luxury car makers 
this is not a problem to do with the car it has to do with 
manufacturing problems reitman said people give it very high 
marks for appearance and styling for ride for its interior where 
it fails maybe is on assembly and some basic faults in some certain 
systems sometimes its very small things a light doesnt work 
detail things 
anthony parkinson a new yorker and jaguar owner who runs a 
british coachbuilding company predicted jaguar would prosper under 
ford just as another british takeover target astonmartin has 
ford is a progressive company and understands what jaguar is 
all about jaguar is fortunate to have a pretty decent partner and 
ford will pull up the good people in jaguar and raise them above 
50000 cars a year parkinson said 
like many jaguar owners parkinson is hooked 
i love my jaguars because of their beauty their rounded 
shapes and because they are not mercedes or bmws he said 
stressing the individuality of the jaguar as opposed to the 
computerlike precision of the german cars 
another owner miles morris who works at christies 
international car department said he loves his dark british 
racing green 1954 xk120 which runs flawlessly and looks even 
better 
morris said it is the classic styling that attracts collectors 
willing to pay prices that have gone up incredibly 
two years ago you could have bought a nice 120 for 12000 
pounds 19000 morris said now its up to 50000 pounds 
80000 if not a little more 
the world record price for jaguars was set oct 26 at the london 
motorfair when a swedish consortium paid 12 million pounds 19 
million for a 1955 dtype

the peak christmas shopping season might be merry for bargain 
hunters but hohum for retailers 
judging by last months uneven results at the nations major 
retailers the holidays could be a difficult time for some store 
owners large national chain stores on thursday reported modest to 
good october sales 
clothing retailers rang up better results than general 
merchandisers such as sears roebuck and co that have a large 
proportion of their business devoted to bigticket durable 
items ranging from refrigerators to sofas 
but even apparel stores suffered in some parts of the country 
where unusually mild weather discouraged shopping for fall and 
winter clothes 
walter loeb a retail analyst at morgan stanley amp co said he 
has detected signs that consumers are becoming more cautious 
spenders given the weakness in the economy particularly on the 
manufacturing side 
retailers results are watched closely for clues about consumer 
spending which accounts for about twothirds of total us 
economic output 
loeb said sales of mens wear and automobiles are among the 
categories performing poorly he said those categories are early 
indicators of the national spending mood 
im looking for a slowdown in consumer spending in the 
christmas season loeb said noting that retail sales gains will 
be meager 
store owners might have to slash prices to entice reluctant 
consumers which would be good news for shoppers hunting for 
bargains on gifts 
i look for a very promotional christmas said loeb 
on a positive note from a merchants standpoint other analysts 
said sales this month and next might get a boost as consumers shop 
for winter things that they didnt feel like buying during 
octobers indian summer days 
last months results varied widely among the types of retailers 
and for this reason analysts said it was difficult to generalize 
jeffrey edelman a retail analyst at drexel burnham lambert 
inc said general merchandise sales rose an average of 43 percent 
in october for stores open at least a year compared with 
septembers 59 percent increase 
sears the largest us retailer said its sales edged up 07 
percent in the four weeks ended oct 28 but sales at sears stores 
open at least a year called samestore or comparablestore sales 
were flat 
retailers and analysts regard samestore sales as a better 
measure of a companys performance than tallies that include newly 
opened stores 
michael bozic chairman and chief executive of sears merchandise 
group said revenue has been hurt by a decline in demand for 
durables and by the shift in the companys pricing and 
merchandising strategy 
the shift to everyday low prices that began in march and the 
discontinuation of major sales promotions such as super 
saturdays has made comparisons between sales this year and last 
year difficult he said 
but he told financial analysts in new york sears is in good 
shape for christmas inventories are in line to meet expected 
demand 
everyday low pricing is a christmas shoppers dream come 
true said bozic 
sears chairman edward a brennan said were not terribly 
nervous about the fourth quarter we should have an acceptable 
performance 
among the other big retailers reporting thursday were the 
discounters 
k mart corp the second largest retailer said its october 
sales increased 53 percent from a year earlier while on a 
comparablestore basis sales were up 21 percent 
thirdranked walmart stores inc reported a 22 percent 
increase in october sales and an 8 percent pickup in samestore 
results 
among chain stores oriented toward apparel 
jc penney co inc reported a 96 percent october sales gain 
helped by strength in its womens division penneys samestore 
sales rose 82 percent 
limited inc a leading specialty apparel retailer said its 
sales rose 9 percent overall and 6 percent on a comparablestore 
basis 
dayton hudson corp reported its overall october sales went up 
162 percent and its samestore sales rose 85 percent 
may department stores co posted a 93 percent pickup in 
overall october sales and a 67 percent gain in samestore results 
carter hawley hale stores inc a major west coast department 
store operator said its october sales went up 16 percent overall 
while samestore sales were up 46 percent carter hawley said the 
san francisco bay area earthquake substantially hurt sales 
the figures reported by major general merchandise chains and 
apparel retailers differ from the governments monthly retail sales 
figures the commerce department report is more comprehensive and 
covers sales at auto dealers supermarkets restaurants and 
elsewhere

the new york stock exchange is limiting 
computerized program trading in times of sharp market declines but 
congressional officials want even stronger regulatory safeguards 
the nations biggest stock exchange reacted thursday to a wave 
of oppostion to a trading strategy blamed for roiling the financial 
markets but stopped short of calling program trading the sole 
culprit 
if we dont curb some way or another we are going to ruin the 
functioning of the capital markets in this country nyse chairman 
john j phelan jr said 
the exchanges board of directors approved a series of limits 
that will be imposed when the stock market takes rapid dives and 
said it would appoint a commission to study longterm solutions to 
market volatility 
the controls follow a growing outcry against a strategy known as 
index arbitrage which involves the rapid trading of millions of 
shares of stocks and stock futures since the dow jones industrial 
average sank 190 points in a few hours on oct 13 
in washington rep edward j markey dmass pushed a call for 
legislation to give the securities and exchange commission 
authority to halt program trading when prices swing wildly 
markey chairman of a house subcommittee considering market 
reform legislation said the latest nyse changes are not enough 
the measures are wellmeaning but they dont guarantee the 
health of our capital formation system markey said in a 
telephone interview 
we cant rely on any one individual firm institution 
individual caring about a market overall he said thats why 
we need the sec they do have the responsibility to oversee the 
market 
under the new controls when the dow jones average declines 30 
points all program trading orders that use the exchanges 
automated delivery system will be delayed 15 minutes after a drop 
of 75 points the delay will be 30 minutes 
program trading orders will be delayed for one hour when there 
is a 12point drop in the standard amp poors 500stock index futures 
contract which is traded on the chicago mercantile exchange the 
merc already has a shock absorber trading limit after a 
12point decline which is equivalent to a drop of nearly 100 
points in the dow jones average 
it slows the process down so everybody has a fair chance 
to access the marketplace phelan said 
phelan said program trading was only one contributor to 
volatility and that the exchange hoped to develop longterm 
solutions wall street professionals agreed 
program trading is basically the catalyst for a lot of 
different concerns said economist laszlo birinyi jr head of a 
new york investment management firm its only a small portion of 
the overall problem 
major wall street brokerages have abandoned or curtailed index 
arbitrage in recent days goldman sachs amp co wall streets 
fourthlargest program trader said thursday it would not execute 
such orders for customers when the dow average moves either up or 
down 30 points 
we have been and continue to be concerned about the 
deterioration of liquidity and equity markets the firm said in a 
statement calling on the nyse also to study other trading 
practices that may heighten volatility 
program trading also was blamed by many for accelerating the 
1987 market crash the nyse implemented less dramatic curbs on 
program trading following that debacle 
index arbitrage seeks to capitalize on brief and minute 
differences in the prices of stocks and stockindex futures that 
are based upon the same stocks the trading tactic often is geared 
to make shortterm gains in excitable markets 
opponents claim index arbitrage causes large swings in stock 
prices preventing the nations markets from pricing stocks 
accurately based on demand or economic factors 
they also say the turbulence has frightened individual investors

at franks barber shop in the striketorn 
southwestern virginia coalfields you can get a haircut for 6 and 
free opinions about the legislative race from just about everyone 
who comes in the door 
the race pits a united mine workers district president as a 
writein candidate against a veteran democrat in the state house of 
delegates whose son a judge has fined the union 31 million for 
illegal strike activities 
both candidates and constituents said thursday that frustration 
with the lengthy strike against the pittston coal group more than 
the fines had spurred the union campaign 
but umw spokesman gene carroll said we cant ignore the fact 
that hes got the same name as the judge 
donald mcglothlin jr is a circuit judge in a neighboring county 
outside the legislative district he has issued court orders sought 
by pittston prohibiting the union from disrupting company 
operations 
donald mcglothlin sr has represented buchanan and part of 
tazewell counties in the house of delegates since 1968 with the 
support of organized labor 
the 63yearold attorney was rolling along unopposed when jack 
stump a umw district president announced oct 18 that he was 
running as an independent candidate against him the late start is 
forcing both candidates to scramble with doortodoor campaigning 
barber frank pritchard said when people come into his shop in 
vansant the first topic even before the weather usually is the 
race they talk about a lot of things whos pregnant whos 
running around with who and such but basically its the election 
they get to first 
pritchard and his barbering wife dana said they asked 50 
people when they sat down for a haircut or walked in to shoot the 
breeze this week whether they were going to vote for stump or 
mcglothlin only one backed the incumbent 
despite the results of his poll pritchard said i really 
think don will win there are a lot of undecideds out there what i 
think will hurt jack though is that people will have to write his 
name on the ballot pritchard said ive talked to a lot of 
people who have never done that before 
stump a 41yearold mountain of a man with a trim brown beard 
worked in the mines before he began holding union office 10 years 
ago stump said he became a candidate because mcglothlin has been 
silent since the strike involving pittstons 1695 union employees 
began april 5 his campaign slogan is write in jack stump hell 
speak up 
the labor dispute has become a rallying point for unions across 
the country they say pittston is trying to break the umw while 
refusing to provide adequate medical benefits 
it doesnt take a lot for people to speak up and say hey 
this is not right we thought don could have spoken up for us and 
he didnt stump said adding that umw president richard trumka 
and vice president cecil roberts encouraged him to run 
the amount of the fines imposed by the younger mcglothlin also 
has drawn national attention 
stump who is getting most of his campaign financing from the 
union said were not pleased with the fines but im not 
running against judge mcglothlin i didnt get into this thing just 
to get back at judge mcglothlin 
the elder mcglothlin whose stockiness thick white moustache 
and slow manner of speaking bear resemblance to actor wilfred 
brimley said he is a neutral party in the dispute 
i have not been at any trial he said when asked whether he 
felt targeted by the union because of his sons actions i have 
nothing to do with either side i have no comment to make about my 
son 
mcglothlin said he hopes the appointment of former labor 
secretary bill usery as a super mediator will help settle the 
strike which he said has wreaked havoc on the communities here 
but he said im not going to do anything about the coal 
strike because that is not the function of government if i had the 
power i would have stopped it the first day the government cannot 
settle it it has to be between labor and management

the government has called in the presidents of two 
of japans largest computer companies for warnings after the 
disclosure of three cases where they bid just one yen or about 07 
cent to win local government contracts officials said 
officials expressed concern thursday that the cases would damage 
trust in japanese companies competitive ethics and become an issue 
in current usjapan talks on structural barriers to trade 
such as business customs 
a spokesman for the fair trade commission said it is studying 
how to proceed with an investigation into whether unfair 
competition was involved press reports said the oneyen bidders 
saw the projects as a way to get a head start on computer systems 
expected to be linked up throughout the country 
in two of the cases the two companies fujitsu ltd and nec 
corp were bidding against each other said atsushi tajima of the 
electronics policy division of the ministry of international trade 
and industry fujitsu japans largest computer manufacturer won 
all three contracts 
tajima said nec president tadahiro sekimoto was summoned 
thursday and fujitsu president takuma yamamoto on wednesday for 
warnings by kosuke yamamoto director of the ministrys machinery 
and information services bureau to review bidding practices 
he said sekimoto apologized for the commotion over the cases 
and explained that he has directed branch managers to consult with 
headquarters on bidding 
meanwhile hikaru matsunaga the trade minister described the 
oneyen bids as strange from the viewpoint of common sense and 
business ethics a ministry spokesman said 
matsunaga suggested some minimum standards should be set for 
such bidding said the spokesman speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
chief cabinet secretary mayumi moriyama told a lower house audit 
committee session thursday that the government would be ready to 
discuss the oneyen bid issue in the next round of usjapan 
structural barrier talks scheduled next week in washington 
the government has a big interest in the oneyen bid issue as 
it would impair social and international trust in companies and the 
order of sound competition the ministry of international trade and 
industry and the fair trade commission are dealing with this and 
we would like to discuss the matter even in the structural talks 
with the united states 
in addition to structural issues under legislation adopted last 
year the united states has said japan may face retaliation if it 
does not open its market wider to us supercomputers satellites 
and lumber products 
on wednesday fujitsu said it was trying to withdraw from two of 
the oneyen contracts while work already has been completed on the 
third 
akira imagawa spokesman at fujitsus headquarters in tokyo 
said company officials in the nagano prefecture or state in 
central japan had asked nagano authorities to cancel a oneyen 
contract won last month 
in the nagano deal fujitu and nec made identical oneyen bids 
for a contract to design software for the prefectural librarys 
computer system local officials said 
the prefectural government had set aside 16 million yen or 
about 112000 in its budget for the project said the officials 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
frontline salesmen desperately wanted to win the contract 
but lacked common sense imagawa said 
earlier hiroshima city officials refused to let fujitsu out of 
its oneyen contract to design software to map the hiroshima city 
water supply system although they said their final decision would 
depend on the outcome of a possible fair trade commission 
investigation 
fujitsu had said the bid represented a longterm investment the 
city had budgeted 11 million yen or 78000 for the project 
the third case involved oneyen bids by both fujitsu and nec in 
august 1987 for a contract to design inhouse communication systems 
in the wakayama prefectural office building local officials said 
fujitsu won in a drawing of lots for the contract worth an 
estimated 525 million yen or 37 million 
fujitsu said it already had completed the work but failed in 
bidding for a more expensive followup project in wakayama

although being taken over by ford motor co was 
not jaguar plcs first choice the ailing british luxury carmaker 
could thrive under the worlds secondlargest automaker analysts 
say 
jaguar might be operated independently enough from the american 
company to maintain its cachet as a maker of elegant utterly 
british cars analysts said after the deal was announced thursday 
but a jaguar is a jaguar and a ford is definitely not a 
jaguar said jaguar worker linda graham employees like ms 
graham 30 as well as jaguar dealers and collectors expressed 
doubts that jaguar could keep its unique clubby image 
however analysts said the automaker might be able to use fords 
financial and technological clout to expand its product line to 
compete with cheaper bmw and japanese luxury models 
it will allow them to compete into the 1990s said stephen 
reitman an auto analyst with the london investment firm ubs 
phillips and drew 
jaguar has suffered from a slump in us sales on which it 
depends heavily and for 18 months it has been looking for a 
partner to enable it to expand while remaining an independent 
company 
in a stunning aboutface jaguar agreed thursday to a 25 
billion cash offer from ford which had been an unwanted suitor and 
potential hostile bidder since sept 19 the us company already 
owns 132 percent of jaguars shares 
general motors corp the worlds no 1 automaker had undergone 
nine months of negotiations with jaguar on a deal aimed at 
preserving jaguars independence while boosting its prospects gm 
had planned to take only a minority stake of perhaps 30 percent 
but gm said jaguar with its losses and need for a significant 
cash injection was not worth the equivalent of 1335 a share ford 
agreed to pay 
jaguars shares closed thursday at 1302 down 124 on 
londons stock exchange investors apparently bid the stock down 
because the possibility of a takeover war all but evaporated 
ford stock closed down 62 cents a share at 4650 on the new 
york stock exchange 
the government paved the way for fords bid when it said tuesday 
it was prepared to waive a golden share which allowed it to 
veto any takeover the share was a legacy of jaguars former 
government ownership dropping the golden share raised the 
possibility of a bidding war something jaguars directors 
apparently could not stomach leading to the deal with ford 
jaguars shareholders must approve the takeover by a 75 percent 
majority at a meeting that is to be held at the end of the month 
sanjay dabysing an auto analyst with the economic forecasting 
firm dri europe said ford wants to compete with toyotas lexus 
nissans infinity and hondas acura all luxury models 
what ford intends to do with jaguar is to turn it into another 
bmw he said were looking at a big transformation here they 
need to develop new cars and engines as well as new plant 
bmw the german luxury carmaker produces 500000 cars a year 
10 times jaguars output 
under the ford deal jaguar will be run as a separate entity 
jaguars will continue to be made by the british companys 12500 
workers at its four plants jaguars independent dealer network 
will be maintained 
jaguar will retain a board of directors that will include ford 
representatives and will be responsible for the use of the jaguar 
brand name chairman sir john egan is staying on at least for the 
immediate future jaguar will report to ford of europe not detroit 
headquarters 
fords having spent 16 billion pounds 25 billion and 
making investments of at least half that amount again over the next 
two or three years they are not going to squander that by turning 
jaguar into another ford unit reitman said 
lindsey halstead chairman of ford of europe said at a news 
conference thursday its not something we want to mix in with 
the regular run of the ford business 
halstead said ford has wanted to significantly develop its 
presence in the growing world luxury auto market 
he said there was considerable potential to increase sales 
volume by the expansion of jaguars product line in europe the 
united states and elsewhere 
he said ford would inject an unspecified amount of funds into 
jaguar to develop the existing line and boost its research and 
development funding 
jaguar also will make use of fords worldwide engineering 
purchasing and manufacturing technologies that will help jaguar 
reduce costs egan said

the securities industry needs to reemphasize the 
longterm role of the financial markets while not excluding such 
controversial practices as program trading says the incoming 
leader of the industrys main trade group 
robert n downey a partner with goldman sachs amp co and a 
former member of the municipal securities rulemaking board also 
said thursday the industry needed to patrol itself harder in light 
of congressional debate over government intervention during market 
emergencies 
a safe environment is very very difficult downey said at a 
news conference were going to just try to work harder and 
emphasize the strength of our industry and our very key role in 
capital raising for the nation for its governmentowned unit and 
for its corporations 
downey 53 was nominated to succeed hardwick simmons as 1990 
chairman of the securities industry association which represents 
more than 625 securities brokerages and investment banking firms in 
the united states and canada 
the sia board will vote on the nomination at its annual meeting 
on nov 29 in florida simmons will continue as an officer and 
director of sia 
in recent days several major wall street brokerages have said 
they would curb program trading a computerized group of strategies 
generally linked to activity in stockindex futures 
critics claim the strategy which is used by big institutional 
investors such as banks mutual funds and pension funds to rapidly 
trade millions of shares is dangerously distorting the stock 
market and scaring away small investors program trading has been 
cited as a factor in the october 1987 stock market crash 
downey said the sia at an upcoming board meeting would begin 
formulating a policy to address such practices 
simmons who is vice chairman of shearson lehman hutton inc 
said the industry must work to curtail such strategies and make the 
market attractive to individual investors whom he said have been 
at a disadvantage 
its just that they feel disenfranchised we have to tell them 
that the franchise is still there he said 
downey said practices such as program trading have tended to 
focus the markets attention on shortterm gains to the exclusion 
of longerterm fundamentals such as companies earnings and the 
overall quality of their products he said the industry needs to 
reemphasize a longerterm view although not to the exclusion of 
diversification 
simmons said industry rules to manage index arbitrage one of 
the most controversial forms of program trading likely would be 
forthcoming but a complete ban of the practice is unlikely 
nevertheless the sia could help curb the practice he said 
index arbitrage involves the computerized trading of millions of 
shares in an attempt to capitalize on brief and minute differences 
in the prices of stocks and stockindex futures 
what we have to do is let people know our position which is 
that index arbitrage in and of itself may be harmful to the us 
market simmons said 
simmons dismissed suggestions that curbing index arbitrage would 
send investors overseas saying that equities trading has been 
gradually moving offshore over the last 20 years as japanese and 
other markets have become prominent 
shearson recently halted its index arbitrage and downey said 
goldman sachs has not used the strategy for its own account since 
1987 
simmons also said that market circuitbreakers automatic 
temporary trading halts during extreme market volatility have 
helped more must be done to safeguard the market as evidenced by 
the recent stock market gyrations that saw the dow jones industrial 
average fall 190 points on oct 13 
congress currently is hearing testimony on proposed legislation 
that could give federal regulators authority to halt trading in 
future market emergencies 
treasury secretary nicholas s brady told congress this week 
called for federal intervention while richard c breeden the 
chairman of the securities and exchange commission said that he 
does not want such power

the government divided over britains increasing 
isolation in europe has unveiled an alternative goslow approach 
to plans for european monetary union 
earlier rumors of an alleged insidertrading scandal involving 
a cabinet minister shook the london stock market transport 
secretary cecil parkinson denied speculation thursday he was 
involved and the markets steadied 
but the jittery reaction reflected edginess about the 
government already shaken by last weeks resignation of the top 
treasury official chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson he 
quit in a policy dispute with prime minister margaret thatcher over 
europe 
the new chancellor john major issued a government paper laying 
down what he termed britains marketbased approach to the 
development of economic and monetary union among the 12 nations of 
the eec 
the british plan said it was far too early to commit the eec 
to having a single currency and central bank envisioned in the 
current plan drawn up by jacques delors head of the european 
commission at the communitys headquarters in brussels 
french president francois mitterrand president of the 12nation 
eec is pressing the delors plan 
last month mitterrand went further and said economic and 
monetary union would be a decisive step toward achieving a 
political unity of the community 
the british plan left open what may happen in the longer term 
about economic and monetary union 
it said londons approach was based on general principles that 
market forces not new europewide institutions should prevail 
and that decisions should be taken at european level only when they 
cannot be taken by national governments 
it is an excellent paper mrs thatcher told the house of 
commons 
it shows you can achieve closer economic and monetary 
cooperation much better and more rapidly by working with the grain 
of market forces than by setting up new bureaucratic and highly 
centralized institutions which are not accountable to anybody 
she added 
mrs thatcher in june rejected the single central bank and 
onecurrency notions as removing from national governments 
fundamental powers to decide on economic policy 
mrs thatcher agreed however on strict conditions that britain 
will in principle join the currencystabilizing mechanism of the 
european monetary system that links nine of the eec currencies 
but she is unenthusiastic about the idea while lawson wanted to 
join as soon as possible he quit saying he could no longer carry 
on while mrs thatcher retained a personal economic adviser who 
opposes british membership the adviser then also resigned 
london share prices tumbled in early trading after rumors swept 
the market that another cabinet minister was likely to resign in 
the alleged insiderdealing scandal 
after several hours of speculation that parkinson was the 
minister he issued a statement through his lawyers saying he has 
not engaged in any insider dealing nor in any share dealings 
the statement added that parkinson transferred his funds to 
stockbrokers after he joined the cabinet in 1987 and had since 
played no part whatsoever in any investments the brokers made 
the rumors began after the scotsman a newspaper based in 
edinburgh scotland reported that britains channel 4 television 
network has investigated an insiderdealing group that allegedly 
has at least one senior government member among its clients 
channel 4 confirmed it is working on an investigation but said 
the program was as yet neither complete nor scheduled 
insider trading is the illegal attempt to profit by buying and 
selling stock based on inside information about a company such as 
takeover offers or profits prospects which is not available to the 
public

conceivably ford motor co could write a check 
to buy itself a fancy but financially troubled british auto company 
and have enough left in the coffers to do it again 
that explains in part why cashrich ford was willing to pay top 
dollar for jaguar plc 
the other major jaguar suitor general motors corp bowed out 
saying fords 25 billion price wasnt financially wise 
ford officials said they werent ready to announce how the 
company would foot the bill but the company had 58 billion in 
cash on hand as of sept 30 making it possible for the no 2 us 
automaker to complete the deal without borrowing a single quid 
david wyss chief financial economist with drimcgraw hill an 
economic consulting firm said it isnt in fords nature to sit on 
money 
they dont see themselves primarily in the business of 
investing money he said so if theres money there they feel 
it should be used in productive interests 
ford had a record 103 billion in cash as of june 30 1988 
thanks to several profitable years since then the company has 
been whittling it down mostly through a stock repurchase plan a 
dividend increase last january and an aggressive capital spending 
program 
ford already is the biggest us automaker in europe and has 
been seeking an even greater share 
we have aimed for some to time to develop our presence in the 
world luxury auto market said lindsey halstead chairman of ford 
of europe at the london news conference announcing the deal 
its a significant growth segment of the market that we want to 
be in in a more significant way 
ford earlier this year held unsuccessful talks with the swedish 
car and truck maker saabscania ab reportedly over saabs heavy 
truck business 
analysts have said the saab discussions and interest in jaguar 
signaled the automakers determination to position itself ahead of 
the removal of trade barriers within the european community in 1992 
while ford has been a successful massmarket producer in europe 
ford of europe makes 18 million vehicles a year it had not 
been as well regarded for specialty vehicles 
fords european operations date to 1903 when founder henry ford 
began exporting cars to england from the united states 
in its recent years of record profitability the continent has 
been important to ford not only as a car and truck market but as a 
base for its earnings during the past two years profits from 
fords european operations have risen while north american earnings 
have declined 
furthermore ford rivals gm and chrysler corp also have been 
expanding their european presence 
chrysler which sold its european plants more than a decade ago 
when it encountered financial trouble that led to a us government 
bailout announced in february it would return to european 
production through a joint venture with frances renault to build a 
sportutility vehicle 
gm which has made cars on the continent since the early 1920s 
has seven assembly and 30 component plants in europe owns all of 
luxury sports carmaker group lotus plc of britain and has a 
european joint truck venture with isuzu motors ltd of japan 
two weeks ago ford announced it was dropping its merkur line of 
west germanmade luxury performance cars because of slow sales the 
two merkur cars the scorpio and xr4ti had been sold through 
lincolnmercury dealerships

sears roebuck and co is in the final stages of 
arranging a transaction that would allow the giant retailer to 
realize some of the value of its headquarters tower sears 
chairman says 
were very close to a deal on the tower that will satisfy all 
the objectives that we established one year ago edward a 
brennan sears chairman and chief executive officer disclosed at 
a meeting thursday with financial analysts 
brennan said an announcement on the fate of the worlds tallest 
building was expected by the end of the year 
speaking with reporters after the meeting at a new york hotel 
brennan wouldnt say whether the expected deal involved an outright 
sale of sears tower or an alternative transaction such as a new 
mortgage 
the wall street journal reported today that sears is understood 
to be negotiating with the bostonbased pension fund adviser 
aldrich eastman amp waltch inc to mortgage the property for nearly 
850 million in a debt and equity deal 
sears chief aim all along has been to get the appreciated value 
out of its headquarters building brennan said 
the funds realized from the 110story chicago landmark would be 
used to repay money sears borrowed to buy back some of its shares 
under a stock repurchase program 
sears also intended to use proceeds from a transaction to reduce 
its debt placed at 2 billion in a july filing sears submitted to 
the securities and exchange commission 
a year ago sears announced its intentions concerning the tower 
as part of a major restructuring program by the nations largest 
retailer analysts have estimated that sears tower could fetch 800 
million to 1 billion 
the restructuring included a switch in sears pricing and 
merchandising strategy the transfer of its retailing division 
headquarters from the tower to a location in suburban chicago and 
the repurchase of 40 million shares or about 10 percent of sears 
oustanding common stock 
in september reports circulated that a prospective sale of 
sears tower to a canadian developer had run into a hitch 
following the reported breakdown in talks with torontobased 
olympia amp york developments ltd sears was said to be reviewing 
its options and possibly reconsidering the idea of selling the 
tower 
neither sears nor olympia amp york have ever commented on the 
reports

a senate committee has passed a bill to reform 
the commodity futures industry while reauthorizing the federal 
agency that regulates it 
but the committee chairman sen patrick leahy dvt said he 
wanted the commodity futures trading commission to report on the 
effects of the oct 13 stock market drop before legislation to 
reauthorize the agency reaches the senate floor 
the senate committee on agriculture nutrition and forestry 
voted thursday to send the futures trading practices act of 1989 
for consideration to the full senate 
this will be the toughest futures reform package adopted by 
this committee in more than a decade said leahy who introduced 
this bill last month along with sen richard lugar rind the 
committees ranking republican 
the bill introduced in the wake of a series of fraud and 
racketeering indictments at the nations two largest futures 
exchanges seeks to impose a number of reforms including tougher 
standards on exchanges for the reconstruction of transactions 
known as the audit trail 
audit trails enable regulators to determine the timing and 
sequences of trades as a guard against fraud 
but amendments to the bill will give the cftc authority to 
exempt very small exchanges from the new standards 
the bill also would expand the cftcs authority to collect 
service fees to fund its surveillance of trading floors another 
amendment however placed a cap on the size of those fees 
the bill does not restrict computerdriven program trading in 
the financial markets 
a similar bill already has been passed by the house 
but leahy released a letter he wrote the cftc oct 17 asking 
the agency to evaluate the cooperation and communication between 
exchanges and regulators in the securities and futures markets 
during the 190point market drop on friday the 13th 
leahy sought a preliminary report before the congress completes 
work on the reauthorization bill so if the cftc finds reforms are 
needed i want to be able to implement them quickly

economic sanctions have cost 
south africa 500000 jobs and billions of dollars since 1985 a 
leading economist says 
the study released thursday by chris van wyk chief executive of 
the bankorp banking group was described by financial writers as 
the most definitive attempt yet to quantify the impact of sanctions 
on south africa 
the study said sanctions and disinvestment measures since 1985 
had cost a cumulative 40 billion rand in foreign exchange 
resulting in production losses of about 80 billion rand and a total 
spending loss of 100 billion rand 
based on the average value of the rand during the period the 
cumulative foreign exchange loss would total about 16 billion the 
total production loss about 32 billion and the spending loss 
about 45 billion 
despite the sanctions south africas economy still is 
considered the strongest and most diversified on the continent 
van wyk said the overall economic impact was similar to what 
south africa would have experienced had the price of gold its 
major export averaged 200 an ounce instead of 400 over the past 
five years 
interest rates and inflation have been higher the rand weaker 
wages lower and growth employment and spending levels much lower 
than they would have been without sanctions he said 
about 80 percent of new jobseekers were blacks van wyk said 
the harshest burden of sanctions has fallen on them he 
said a continuation of existing trade and financial sanctions 
throughout the 1990s would render a million more black people 
jobless and 2 million more financially destitute 
sanctions had impaired south africas ability to reach its full 
export potential and had radicalized many young blacks to the 
left and many white voters to the right van wyk said the 
moderate center has been weakened making a political settlement 
much more difficult 
but there had also been some positive spinoffs he said 
economic considerations began to assume their rightful place in 
government decisionmaking along with commitment to concepts 
such as tax reform and privatization 
since 1985 several hundred foreign companies have pulled out of 
south africa generally citing either financial concerns or 
pressure from antiapartheid groups 
in the same period most western countries have imposed some 
type of trade sanctions on south africa affecting exports of major 
products such as coal and steel even though some new markets have 
been found in the far east

the stock market was mixed today in an equivocal 
response to a strongerthanexpect report on employment 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 287 to 263443 in 
the first half hour of trading 
losers outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading 
of new york stock exchangelisted issues with 391 up 531 down and

volume on the big board came to 2150 million shares as of 10 
am on wall street 
the labor department reported this morning that nonfarm payroll 
employment increased by 233000 in october as the civilian 
unemployment rate held steady at 53 percent 
advance estimates on wall street had called for a gain of not 
much more than 150000

the new york buyout firm of coniston partners 
disclosed today that it has accumulated a 97 percent stake in ual 
corp and plans to seek control of the airline companys board 
coniston which played a crucial role two years ago in the 
breakup of travel conglomerate allegis corp the former owner of 
united airlines has spent roughly 333 million in recent months 
amassing 212 million ual shares said coniston principal paul e 
tierney 
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission 
coniston said it plans to solicit consents from shareholders to 
reduce uals board from 16 to five members three of whom would be 
coniston principals 
with control of the board coniston would be able to steer the 
company toward a sale restructuring or recapitalization 
we would like to see an extraordinary transaction of some kind 
take place that would bring stability to the company and be fair to 
the various constituencies tierney said in a telephone interview 
united airlines would have no comment on conistons stake 
spokeswoman sara dornacker said from uals chicago offices 
tierney noted that while coniston has not proposed acquiring 
ual it doesnt preclude our participating in some kind of 
transaction 
the takeover battle for ual began in august when billionaire 
marvin davis offered to acquire the company for 240 a share ual 
later accepted a 300ashare 675 billion buyout proposal from 
an employeemanagement group but the deal collapsed last month 
when the bidders were unable to secure financing 
the announcement of the collapse of the ual deal on oct 13 
helped trigger a 190point drop in the dow jones industrial average 
and turmoil in stock markets worldwide 
earlier this week investor saul steinberg stepped into the fray 
when he filed for federal antitrust clearance to buy up to 25 
percent of uals stock 
tierney said that coniston has been in touch with uals unions 
but said it is too early to characterize the unions position 
ual stock has swung wildly since the battle over the airline 
began reaching a high of 294 before collapsing in early trading 
on the new york stock exchange today ual had jumped 8 a share to 
181 
the shareholders have been hammered in the last few months 
tierney acknowledged but we would like to strike a transaction 
that is good for employees both union and nonunion 
in a statement coniston said its team of directors would seek 
to provide job security and if desired an opportunity for 
equity ownership for employees 
coniston has reaped millions by buying into companies 
pressuring for changes and then walking away with cash it waged a 
bitter and unsuccessful proxy fight over gillette co pressed for 
the leveraged buyout of storer communications and participated in 
the merger of viacom international and national amusements 
only once has the partnership run by principals tierney keith 
r gollust and augustus k oliver actually acquired a company 
earlier this year coniston took over tw services inc after a 
bitter ninemonth battle 
but a cold reception in the junk bond market last week forced 
coniston to postpone the sale of some 115 billion in junk bonds 
needed to finance their acquisition of the remaining public shares 
of tw which is comprised of the fastfood hardees and dennys 
restaurants among others 
in 1987 coniston reaped about 460 million when allegis bought 
back shares after agreeing to sell its westin and hilton 
international hotel chains and hertz car rental business 
coniston also endorsed the selection of stephen wolf as ual 
chairman and john pope as chief financial officer both of whom 
would remain on the board if coniston is successful in its plan to 
take over 
tierney said that although coniston has retained some ownership 
of ual stock over the past two and a half years the team sold 
virtually all of its position before the purchase by the pilots was 
disclosed conistons current stake was built up since then he 
said 
we believe this is a great franchise tierney said of 
united its an airline which has taken meaningful strides 
forward in last few years theres no intention here to break up 
the company or sell it through liquidation we want to see it grow 
and stabilize

soviet union and china were shopping for more us grain

for all the stock markets seemingly manic 
behavior lately some analysts see a message behind its madness 
amid the controversies over program trading and corporate 
takeovers stock traders sometimes appear to have veered off on a 
throughthelooking glass digression from what is taking place 
elsewhere in the economy 
but at the same time close followers of the financial scene 
say the market has taken on an increasingly powerful role not 
just in reacting to economic trends and government policies but 
also in helping to determine them 
ever since the crash of 1987 these analysts note the federal 
reserve has been forced to give a lot of weight to the state of the 
stock market in setting its credit policies 
legislators too have effectively been put on notice that they 
cant start changing rules for instance on taxes corporate 
takeovers or foreign investment in this country without taking 
into account how stock investors might react 
the implicit penalty for a misstep on any of these matters is a 
sudden drop in stock prices that threatens farreaching trouble for 
the domestic and world economies not to mention for any 
policymakers who wind up taking the blame 
this vigilante effect first gained wide attention in the 
bond market in the early 1980s 
in the view of many analysts the large amorphous group of 
people who invest in bonds became increasingly fearful that the 
federal reserve wasnt doing enough to restrain inflation 
so they collectively refused to bid for bonds until interest 
rates reached levels that restrained the growth of credit 
their market actions encouraged or some would say compelled 
central banks to tighten to slow economic growth and prevent any 
inflation resurgence said robert barbera economist at shearson 
lehman hutton inc 
today we contend it is stock market reaction to tootight 
monetary policy that at times influences monetary policy and that 
reduces somewhat the risk of global recession 
thus in the second half of the 1980s stock market vigilantes 
have replaced the bond market vigilantes of the first half 
analysts say this shift was clearly demonstrated in the 
aftermath of black monday oct 19 1987 the fed which had been 
tightening credit before stocks crashed abruptly began to supply 
assurances of plentiful amounts of money 
in addition a bill that had been taking shape in congress to 
discourage some forms of takeover activity was shelved 
another severe selloff on friday oct 13 of this year once 
again drew signals from the fed that it would provide whatever 
liquidity was necessary to stave off a market collapse 
as time passes the fed continues to watch the stock market 
said darwin beck economist at first boston corp 
all this naturally raises several issues who appointed bond and 
stock traders to these positions of power can they be trusted to 
use it wisely or even responsibly if they dont to whom do they 
have to account 
the answer to any of those questions depends to a great extent 
on the respondents point of view 
defenders of the vigilantes say they are unlikely ever to engage 
in any sort of conspiracy given their sheer diversity and the fact 
that they compete against each other for their livelihoods 
skeptics on the other hand can cite the history of the 1980s 
as conclusive evidence of the susceptibility of unfettered markets 
to abuse of many kinds 
on one point however most observers agree the modern 
financial vigilante is a product of an era when many governments 
around the world have promoted free markets as the best means of 
making societies and economies work 
the activities of the stockmarket vigilantes now promise to be 
studied in the future as a test of whether that premise is right

starting jan 1 parents can take advantage of a 
savings bond program that will allow them to put away money for 
their childrens college education taxfree 
the program involves the us treasurys series ee savings 
bonds which have been around for years the difference is that 
federal tax on the bonds interest will be forgiven if the proceeds 
are used for tuition savings bonds always are exempt from state 
and local taxes 
the program is limited to residents at least 24 years old who 
meet certain income requirements married couples with adjusted 
gross incomes of 60000 a year and under and single people with 
incomes of 40000 and under 
for those with higher incomes the taxdeductibility is reduced 
according to a scale married couples with incomes of 90000 and 
over and singles with incomes of 55000 or more cannot participate 
the bonds may only be bought by parents for their children 
other relatives may not participate 
using savings bonds to put away money for college education has 
long been popular but the 1986 federal tax code revision made it 
less advantageous 
before the tax law changes parents typically would buy bonds in 
their childs name and declare the interest as income on tax forms 
filed for their children this way the child usually would pay no 
tax since the interest income would be lower than the childs 
minimum taxable income 
however the revised code taxes children under age 14 at their 
parents marginal tax rate instead of at the childrens rate that 
eliminated some of the tax advantage 
the new program should restore the popularity of savings bonds 
for college tuition funding said stephen meyerhardt a spokesman 
for the treasurys savings bond program 
he said the new program is simpler than the traditional way of 
putting away college funds in bonds because there is no need to 
file annual tax forms for the children 
instead the bonds will be bought in the parents names and 
interest will only be declared when a bond is cashed in to pay for 
tuition he said the internal revenue service is still working on 
rules for how this interest will be excluded from taxation 
series ee treasury bonds sell for half their face value the 
face value is paid at maturity they can be bought for as little as 
25 and are sold at most banks and savings and loans 
meyerhardt said the treasury has been deluged with inquiries 
about the program obviously the potential audience is huge 
he said last week 
while university officials generally praise the savings plan 
they say they wish it had been extended to grandparents and 
students as well 
richard f rosser president of the national association of 
independent colleges and universities agreed there should be great 
demand for the program 
its simple and its uncomplicated he said this may very 
well become an important savings program for just taking it out of 
your monthly wages people have bought ee bonds for years through 
payroll deductions 
this is not the first college bond program several states have 
marketed some of their normal state revenue bonds as tuition 
savings bonds 
these bonds like treasury bonds are zerocoupon bonds meaning 
there is no annual interest payment or coupon thats why 
theyre sold at a discount with their face amount paid at maturity 
in washington state a 50 million initial offering quickly sold 
out last year said edward palmer a first vice president at 
security pacific bank washington the lead manager for the bonds 
though a 200 million issue this year was not a sellout palmer 
said the state and the bank consider the program extremely 
successful 
you really feel like youre doing something for people 
palmer said 
among other states that have issued college savings bonds are 
illinois and north carolina

ford motor co the worlds secondlargest 
automaker is placing a costly bet that it can profitably 
massproduce jaguars without spoiling the luxury cars main selling 
point its snob appeal 
with its upperclass english image jaguar is to cars what 
burberry is to expensive raincoats asprey is to jewelry and 
wedgwood to china 
the exclusive brand name is what made moneylosing jaguar plc 
worth 25 billion to ford in a friendly takeover deal announced 
thursday 
the risk is that the 67yearold british company will be 
tarnished by fords downmarket image and that a jaguar simply 
will never be a jaguar again 
jaguar will be wholly owned by ford if jaguars shareholders 
agree by a 75 percent majority at a special meeting late this 
month but jaguar will be operated as a separate entity both 
companies stressed 
fords offering price is more than double the market price of 
jaguars shares in midseptember before ford first declared its 
intention to buy a stake in the british company 
no 1 automaker general motors corp which had been jaguars 
preferred suitor dropped out of the contest thursday saying 
jaguar wasnt worth the price for nine months it had tried to work 
out a friendly deal that would have given it a minority stake in 
the british company 
jaguar wasnt a bargain analysts agreed 
ford is paying quite a high price said stephen reitman an 
auto analyst at the london investment firm ubs phillips and drew 
said sanjay dabysing a motor industry analyst with the private 
forecasting firm dri europe it seems like a lot of money to pay 
for a company that is making losses at the moment 
ford is going to have to spend another billion dollars or more 
on jaguar to fulfill the american companys dream of expanding in 
the fastergrowing luxury end of the market 
analysts stressed the takeover is part of an expensive longterm 
strategy that at best will not reap rewards for years to come 
ford apparently believes that buying jaguar at this price is a 
cheaper faster and less risky approach than starting from scratch 
this is not fords first foray into luxury cars 
ford acquired britains aston martin lagonda two years ago in 
1986 it failed to obtain a stake in italian car maker alfa romeo 
last month it abandoned negotiations with swedish car maker 
saabscania and it also dropped plans to sell its germanbuilt 
merkur luxury cars in the united states 
analysts expect jaguar to post a loss for 1989 after a slim 45 
million in profit last year which came on revenue of 107 billion 
jaguar has suffered in recent years from a slump in us luxury 
car sales and the weak dollar it depends on the united states for 
a whopping 40 percent of its sales 
for 18 months jaguar had searched high and low for financial 
and technological support but jaguar chairman sir john egan was 
looking for a minority partner because he insisted jaguars 
independence was crucial to its success 
our desire has always been to keep our destiny firmly in our 
own hands egan said last month 
but jaguars stock soared on speculation of a takeover contest 
between the rival american auto makers 
it became increasingly difficult to see how a partial deal 
would succeed egan said at a thursday news conference 
jaguar was compelled to recommend fords offer to its 
shareholders because the us automaker offered a good price and 
made assurances that jaguar would operate separately egan said 
ford probably will seek ultimately to multiply jaguars annual 
production tenfold to half a million cars from the current 50000 
and add cheaper models to compete with west german luxury auto 
maker bmws line and with the emerging japanese luxury models 
analysts said 
the cheapest jaguar now costs 37900 its narrow product range 
is made up of xj6 and series iii sedans xjs sports cars and 
limousines a year 
lindsey halstead the chairman of ford of europe said at the 
news conference he believed jaguars product range could be 
expanded in the united states europe and elsewhere 
specifics were still to be worked out halstead said but ford 
was prepared to invest whatever was necessary in jaguar it also 
would provide technological support he said 
egan said we will look at areas where we can make the biggest 
and earliest gains 
the distinctive jaguars still will be produced in britain by 
jaguars 12500 workers at four expanding plants headquarters will 
be maintained in coventry 95 miles northwest of london 
jaguars dealer network will be maintained jaguar will continue 
to have a separate board of directors including ford directors 
who will have sole discretion in the application of the jaguar 
marque or brand name the companies said 
the analyst reitman said they have to keep jaguar at an arms 
length so that jaguar is not too closely associated in the 
customers eyes with being just another ford jaguar is very 
unique the cachet that is attached to the thing is very strong 
the tough and proud egan will stay on at the company for the 
time being 
the jaguar chairman was knighted three years ago for his 
successful turnaround of jaguar during the 1980s from an ailing 
stateowned automaker to a flourishing modern british company 
hailed as a jewel of prime minister margaret thatchers huge 
privatization drive 
referring to his new boss halstead egan joked at the news 
conference ive persuaded him to stop calling me sir

with a boost from saudi arabia the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries pushed oil production 
in october well over its target to the highest level all year 
according to estimates released friday 
the surge in production came as key players staked out 
bargaining positions in advance of a crucial meeting later this 
month analysts said 
the international energy agency said in its monthly oil market 
report that the cartels output soared last month to 229 million 
barrels a day about 500000 barrels more than in the previous 
month 
but some analysts put the figure even higher opecs daily 
target is 205 million barrels a day for the last quarter of 1989 
the main opec production increase was registered in saudi 
arabia where crude oil production rose to 53 million barrels a day 
in october said the report saudi arabias quota is about 5 
million barrels a day 
theyve got the pedal to the metal said peter gignoux 
international energy director at shearson lehman hutton in london 
who believes the saudis produced 56 million barrels a day or more 
the saudis he said are setting another bargaining chip on 
the table for this months meeting 
petrostrategies a parisbased oil newsletter also puts saudi 
production at 56 million barrels a day and total opec output at 
232 million barrels in the first half of october 
there is now a real risk that the current strength of oil 
prices could give way to a gradual slide over coming weeks it 
said although oil demand remains firm it is insufficient to 
absorb the high supply 
oil prices have been fairly steady although they remain under 
the cartels target of 18 a barrel a basket of seven crudes 
monitored by opec averaged 1743 a barrel in late october 
prices for west texas intermediate the benchmark us crude 
have remained in the 19 to 20abarrel range in the last two 
months wti normally is priced about 2 higher than the opec basket 
soaring demand by developing countries has helped soak up opecs 
excess but many analysts agree that prices could suffer if 
production is not reined in soon 
demand for opecs oil in the first half of 1990 was estimated by 
the energy agency at just under 21 million barrels a day 
consumption by the united states still the worlds largest 
consumer of oil and other industrial nations is expected to shrink 
in coming months due partly to seasonal factors 
opecs oil ministers are scheduled to meet on nov 25 in vienna 
austria to map strategy for the coming year an eightmember 
monitoring panel is due to gather a few days earlier 
at the top of their agenda will be new production caps for the 
first half of 1990 
the ministers will have to weigh demand and prices before 
deciding an overall supply target and then divvying up the sum 
among the 13 nations 
kuwait and the united arab emirates have been cheating on their 
quotas in recent months to press their demands for a larger share 
of the output total 
at a september meeting in geneva the ministers agreed to lift 
their production ceiling from 195 million barrels a day to 205 
million barrels in the octoberdecember period 
they also discussed and will do so again at the upcoming 
meeting an iranian plan for passing out new production shares 
the proposal called for raising the overall output cap to 215 
million barrels a day to meet the demands primarily of kuwait and 
the united arab emirates gabon and ecuador also would get more 
the shares of saudi arabia qatar and libya would stay the same 
iran and iraq would lose a little and algeria nigeria indonesia 
and venezuela would lose more 
the agency is an arm of the 24nation organization for economic 
cooperation and development

share prices on the london stock exchange finished 
moderately higher friday boosted largely by technical factors 
affecting the availability of selected bluechip stocks 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index closed 190 
points or 088 percent higher at 21731 after it drifted off a 
session high of 21751 when early wall street activity became 
extremely choppy 
the key index had been strong during most of the session 
rebounding from a low of 21529 
dealers noted that the index has shown some resilience since the 
resignation last week of chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson 
gaining 44 percent from last fridays close of 20821 last 
fridays session was the first after lawsons unexpected departure 
tight availabilities of blue chips particularly those with 
strong overseas earnings and proven returns helped bolster the 
index throughout the day a relatively steady british pound also 
helped keep the london market on a firmer footing dealers added 
the socalled squeeze in bluechip shares has been a key factor 
in the market throughout the week and underscores its reluctance to 
deal outside traditionally recessionproof stocks dealers said 
the ft 30share index closed 151 points higher at 17464 
volume was 3770 million shares traded little better than 
thursdays thin 3528 million shares

unemployment held steady at 53 percent last 
month as the economy added 233000 jobs the government said today 
in a report that showed continued troubles in the industrial sector 
the labor department said all of the nonfarm payroll growth 
came in the serviceproducing sector with most of that coming as 
schools and local governments continued to add jobs for the school 
year 
the department revised september payroll growth downward to 
201000 from the previously reported 209000 
the manufacturing sector which lost a revised 88000 jobs in 
september lost an additional 13000 in october to post its fourth 
consecutive monthly decline 
underscoring the weakness in that sector was new data showing 
the average manufacturing workweek fell from 418 hours to 408 
hours and overtime was virtually nonexistent after averaging just 
under four hours a week for several months the automobile 
manufacturing industry continued to struggle losing 14000 jobs 
last month 
the 233000 jobs added to nonfarm payrolls was more than most 
analysts had predicted and likely will give pause to federal 
reserve policymakers who had been seen as leaning toward a further 
easing of credit which in turn would lower interest rates 
analysts said the report showed the economy continued to expand 
although at a far slower pace than last year and that the growth 
was strong enough to prevent a further easing of credit by the 
federal reserve the fed policymakers meet nov 14 to discuss 
monetary policy 
the economy is clearly slowing down but once again theres no 
recession in these numbers said micheal evans head of a 
washington forecasting firm there is however continued sign of 
accelerating wages and the fed is worried about that so they 
couldnt possibly ease as a result of this report 
the labor department determines unemployment through a household 
survey and its jobgrowth totals through a separate business 
survey the two surveys often give conflicting data on employment 
growth and today the department said it had determined why more 
americans are holding two or more jobs 
most dual jobholders appear on two or more payrolls in the 
business survey but are counted only once in the household 
survey labor statistics commissioner janet norwood said in 
testimony she was giving congress today with the demand for 
labor strengthening considerably in recent years increasing 
numbers of workers have taken on secnd jobs 
also up at a rate higher than predictions were average hourly 
earnings which rose 07 percent in october a sign that upward 
pressure on wages persists most analysts had predicted an increase 
of 04 percent 
the october report showed that the civilian labor force grew by 
65000 americans last month to 124 million and that 1175 million 
of them had jobs the labor force consists of those who either have 
jobs or are actively seeking work 
while the manufacturing workweek declined the overall workweek 
in the private nonfarm sector edged up by 01 hour in october to 
a seasonally adjusted 348 hours the department attributed most of 
the decline in manufacturing hours to the strike by boeing workers 
they were not counted as being off payrolls however because their 
strike began the same week the department took its monthly survey 
while local government payrolls expanded because of the school 
year job growth in the healthservices sector continued its steady 
growth adding 33000 jobs in october job growth in business 
services was just 1000 employment in finance insurance and real 
estate was flat or up just slightly 
retail trade added 24000 jobs last month while transportation 
and public utilities added 27000 jobs in october and wholesale 
trade 6000 
but in manufacturing and other goodsproducing industries the 
news was less encouraging 
mining and construction posted modest gains as did the 
nondurable manufacturing sector but the declining payrolls in 
auto plants and electrical and metal plants continued 
the unemployment rates among demographic groups changed 
somewhat with joblessness among white adult men falling from 48 
percent to 45 percent and rising among white adult women rising 
from 45 percent to 47 percent 
overall teenage unemployment fell from 151 to 149 percent a 
figure influenced by the start of school 
among black adult men unemployment rose from 10 percent to 103 
percent joblessness among black adult women also rose from 96 
percent to 10 percent 
unemployment among black teens fell from 373 percent to 342 
percent and among hispanics the rate dropped from 83 percent to 
79 percent

unemployment held steady at 53 percent last 
month as the economy added 233000 jobs the government said friday 
in a report that stifled talk of an imminent drop in interest rates 
the surprising economic strength to begin the fourth quarter 
which came despite the seventh consecutive monthly decline in 
manufacturing was largely attributed to continued local 
government hiring for the school year 
automobile manufacturing led the overall decline in the 
industrial sector 
analysts interpreted the data as proof no recession would come 
this year although some said the economy would flirt with one early 
next year if the manufacturing slump spills over into related 
services industries 
and they said the unexpected job growth and fresh evidence of 
persistent wage inflation would keep the federal reserve 
immediately from easing its hold on credit which in turn would 
have triggered lower interest rates for consumers 
the labor department said average hourly earnings rose 07 
percent in october most analysts had anticipated jobgrowth of 
about 150000 and a 04 percent boost in hourly earnings 
the fed will be in a nochange stance at least until the next 
unemployment report said allen sinai of boston co economic 
advisers others said it might relax its hold on credit when its 
policymakers meet next week when the government will have issued 
new inflation data 
the economy is clearly slowing down but once again theres no 
recession in these numbers said micheal evans head of a 
washington forecasting firm there is however continued sign of 
accelerating wages and the fed is worried about that so they 
couldnt possibly ease as a result of this report 
initial reaction in financial markets to the 
strongerthanexpected report was muted both the stock and bond 
markets were little changed 
the civilian unemployment rate remained at 53 percent as the 
civilian labor force grew by 65000 americans last month to 124 
million and the number of them who had jobs rose to 1175 million 
virtually all of the growth came in services 
local governments added 96000 jobs most of which the labor 
department said were schoolrelated and state governments added 
10000 more 
the booming healthservices sector grew by 33000 jobs last 
month while employment in business services finance and real 
estate was up slightly or flat 
retail trade added 24000 jobs transportation and public 
utilities 27000 and wholesale trade 6000 
the goodsproducing sector reported an overall drop of 3000 
jobs a decline that would have been worse had not modest gains in 
mining and construction offset the 13000 drop in manufacturing 
employment that followed a revised drop of 88000 factory jobs in 
september 
the durablegoods sector of manufacturing has lost more than 
150000 jobs in the last five months 
layoffs in automobile manufacturing which lost 14000 jobs last 
month and 29000 in september are fueling the decline that 
sectors slump appears likely to continue chrysler announced major 
layoffs friday 
underscoring manufacturings weakness the department said the 
average factory workweek fell from 411 hours to 408 hours and 
overtime was virtually nonexistent after averaging just under four 
hours a week for several months 
the department said some of that decline was because of the 
machinists strike against boeing corp 
we have a twoheaded economy said sinai manufacturing is 
in a recession but the service side is ok so the overall economy 
can keep growing so long as the service strength holds up 
the department said unemployment rates among major demographic 
groups were 
adult white men 45 percent down from 48 percent in 
september 
adult white women 47 percent up from 45 percent 
black adult men 103 percent up from 10 percent 
black adult women 10 percent up from 96 percent 
hispanics 79 percent down from 83 percent 
all teenagers 149 percent down from 151 percent 
black teens 342 percent down from 373 percent 
a separate calculation of unemployment that includes members of 
the armed services stationed in the united states was also 
unchanged at 52 percent 
the labor department uses a monthly survey of businesses to 
determine the payroll numbers while the unemployment rate is taken 
from a separate household survey the two surveys often give 
conflicting data on employment growth and friday the department 
said it had confirmed its suspicion that the discrepancy occurs 
because more americans are holding two or more jobs 
most dual jobholders appear on two or more payrolls in the 
business survey but are counted only once in the household 
survey labor statistics commissioner janet norwood told 
congress with demand for labor strengthening in recent years 
increasing numbers of workers have taken on second jobs

a host of wall street investment houses have 
stepped away from index arbitrage but program trading detractors 
say other perhaps even more insidious trading strategies still 
haunt the stock market 
designed to reduce risk and capable of moving massive numbers of 
shares with the flick of a computer key trading techniques with 
militaristic names like tactical asset allocation are being 
used and some say could trigger rampant volatility 
some 40 billion was invested in asset allocation strategies 
eight months ago according to estimates by the house subcommittee 
on telecommunications and finance and because the amount is 
growing rapidly asset allocation has captured the concern of 
politicians and stock exchange officials alike 
pension and mutual funds have come to embrace the strategy 
which in its simplest form divides money among stocks bonds and 
cash the most complex form of asset allocation expands to include 
futures as well as foreign stocks and bonds 
using computer models that evaluate the fundamentals of each 
market money managers shift assets among the various asset 
classes if the stock market appears attractive for example money 
managers might sell bonds to buy stocks 
it is the rapid movement of large sums of money that can spook 
the markets 
new york stock exchange chairman john phelan on friday voiced 
his concern over asset allocation this way the problem is 
when youve got everybody following the same formula its like 
everybody deciding to take a drive in the country on a nice day 
and you cant move because of the traffic on the roads 
on the political front rep edward j markey dmass chairman 
of the telecommunications and finance subcommittee has asked the 
stock exchange to examine tactical asset allocation as part of its 
study of market volatility 
it has potentially the same or even greater negative effect 
than portfolio insurance had in 1987 he said referring to a 
strategy in which sophisticated investors sell options or futures 
against the underlying stock in a portfolio in attempts to offset 
price declines and enhance price increases 
portfolio insurance was drastically curtailed following the 
black monday stock market crash two years ago 
while acknowledging that asset allocators moving funds in the 
same direction can have a snowballing effect on the market 
jack barbanel noted that the strategy relies on the basically sound 
theory of not putting all of your eggs in the same basket 
barbanel president of the princeton njbased first global 
asset management inc said he thinks the concern is overdone 
its the wisest thing to do 
while the asset allocation concept has been around for some 
time most money managers did not rely on it until after the 1987 
crash when they took a beating because they had too much money 
invested in the stock market 
in addition pension funds typically had separate money managers 
handling investments in the various markets barbanel said it is 
only recently that money managers have developed the expertise to 
work across the various markets yet critics are frightened by the 
sheer amount of money involved 
the danger is the more people who get involved in this 
strategy theres a rush to do it first said a staff attorney 
for markeys committee if interest rates move you have the same 
phenomenon of people rushing firing off waves of selling and the 
market doesnt have the liquidity to sustain massive waves of 
selling 
the attorney noted that at any given point index arbitrage the 
practice that involved buying or selling stocks with opposite 
offsetting trades in the futures market involves no more than 10 
billion to 15 billion a fraction of the amount of money devoted 
to asset allocation 
because of public outcry over index arbitrages role in the 
stock markets rollercoaster performance this fall several major 
investment houses suspended the practice and the nyse agreed to 
limit computerized program trading in times of sharp market 
declines 
but just as index arbitrage has been blamed by some for helping 
drive the market down at times asset allocation recently was 
credited with giving stock prices a boost 
according to barrons weekly financial newspaper the move out 
of bonds and into stocks by the cincinnati money management firm 
renaissance investment management inc on oct 16 helped the dow 
jones industrial average recoup nearly all the 190 points it shed 
the previous friday 
the buying spree was dictated by the firms asset allocation 
model it was rumored according to barrons that renaissance went 
100 percent into stocks buying some 44 million shares 
it can save the day said the house attorney but what is 
it going to do if it goes the other way

qintex australia ltd missed a payment 
on land it had optioned for a major resort 3 weeks after its bid 
for mgmua communications co collapsed and two weeks after a us 
affiliate filed for protection from creditors under federal 
bankruptcy laws 
in missing the payment thursday the australian resort and 
entertainment conglomerate surrendered the right to buy 115 acres 
known as the strand and headlands among the last undeveloped major 
sites on the southern california coast 
qintex which is in the middle of a major restructuring designed 
to raise money had said in july that it would build a 1 billion 
resort on the property owned by the chandler family trust in this 
small town in southern orange county 
the series of problems has prompted speculation by wall street 
specialists that all qintexs enterprises are on shaky footing 
skases empire is a collapsing house of cards greg 
kieselmann an analyst with lh friend in los angeles said 
recently 
kieselmann had been one of those who credited skase with the 
financial clout to pull off the 14 billion purchase of mgmua 
which collapsed oct 10 when qintex could not arrange financing 
on oct 19 los angelesbased qintex entertainment inc a 
television production and distribution company that is 43 percent 
owned by qintex australia filed for protection from creditors 
under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code 
qintex entertainments chief financial officer john lloyd said 
qintex australia had been unable or unwilling to help the 
american company make an overdue 59 million payment that could 
have triggered a landslide of further demands from creditors 
qintex australia already had purchased a 170acre monarch beach 
parcel less than a mile north of the strand and headlands for 131 
million from hawaiian developer chris hemmeter 
in a threesentence news release thursday qintex emphasized 
that it would continue to own monarch beach and operate the tennis 
club and links golf course there it did not mention the resort 
project 
ross palmer a spokesman for qintex in los angeles said the 
reference to the monarch beach parcel most likely was made to allay 
fears that the other deal also would fall apart 
on oct 23 qintex australias chairman christopher skase 
announced a major restructuring and a steppedup plan to sell 
assets the strategy was designed to generate more than 600 million 
australian dollars in cash reduce interest costs and eliminate 
other financial liabilities he said

ford motor co could complete its 25 
billion acquisition of the british luxury car maker jaguar by the 
end of the year the head of fords european arm said friday 
l lindsey halstead chairman of ford of europe inc said in a 
video news conference from britain that a jaguar shareholders 
meeting could be called by the end of this month the transaction 
could be completed within days after that if shareholders approved 
the deal 
ford the no 2 us automaker after general motors corp 
announced thursday its agreement to buy jaguar which has suffered 
from declining earnings due to dropping sales in its important us 
market 
the buyout must win approval from 75 percent of jaguars 182 
million outstanding shares which will vote whether to lift a 
restriction barring anyone from owning more than 15 percent of 
jaguar ford owns a 132 percent stake in jaguar 
halstead and ford spokesman bert serre said financing for the 
deal was undetermined technically ford could pay for jaguar out 
of its 58 billion in cash reserves but that seemed unlikely for 
tax reasons analysts have said 
shortly after the announcement thursday standard amp poors put 
some of fords securities on its creditwatch negative list a 
possible prelude to a slight downgrading of their credit ratings 
citing concern about the frenzied pace of fords acquisitions in 
the face of a softening us car market 
recent acquisitions have included last months 335 billion 
purchase of the associates corp financial company from paramount 
communications inc 
because of the pending shareholders vote halstead declined to 
answer specific questions about how jaguar production would be 
affected by a possible merger with ford shared components may be 
the most likely place a consumer would notice the partnership 
however he said we are looking for an opportunity to expand 
volume substantially one of the first items on the agenda is 
defining how that will proceed 
jaguars factory in coventry england makes about 50000 cars 
annually and can produce up to 80000 
there has been speculation that if jaguar came up with a totally 
new model under ford ownership the car would be priced near or 
below the current jaguar xj6 fourdoor sedan which has a base 
price of 39700 
fords most expensive car is the lincoln town car cartier with a 
base price of 33364 
halstead turned aside a suggestion that with the jaguar 
acquisition lincoln no longer would be the companys luxury car 
division he said the character of the two cars with jaguar being 
more of a performance vehicle than lincoln would keep them 
separate 
i dont ever expect to see ford cars in jaguar showrooms and 
no jaguars in ford showrooms halstead said 
ford recently stopped importing the west germanmade merkur 
which was sold through the companys lincolnmercury dealerships 
there are about 140 jaguar dealerships in the united states

at an innercity baltimore intersection six 
billboards carrying alcohol and tobacco advertisements perch atop 
store roofs 
in one an attractive black woman holds a giant ice cube to her 
neck above an inscription that reads salem the refreshest 
on an adjacent sign a handsome black man reaches for a striking 
black woman with one hand and holds a can of colt 45 malt liquor 
with the other grab hold the caption says its 
powerbrewed 
but the days of many of the billboards located largely in 
baltimores black neighborhoods are numbered 
mayor kurt l schmoke said last monday that boisclair 
advertising a firm that owns many of the billboards has agreed to 
take down 450 of the signs by next summer 
the mayor said the company also agreed to cut back the number of 
billboards advertising tobacco and alcohol to no more than 10 
percent of all the citys billboards 
we dont want to be the city that reads whisky bottles said 
schmoke who has placed nearly 50 billboards around the city 
proclaiming it as the city that reads 
a study by the abell foundation showed that of 2015 billboards 
surveyed in baltimore about 70 percent were located in poor 
innercity neighborhoods of those billboards 76 percent were 
advertising liquor and cigarettes 
the statistics are not unique to baltimore faced with slowing 
consumption and declining sales alcohol and tobacco industries 
have been concentrating their billboard advertising in poorer urban 
areas many of them predominantly black 
now health officials office holders neighborhood groups and 
consumer advocates are objecting alarmed by the numbers of people 
in those communities dying from smoking and drinkingrelated 
diseases 
industry representatives dismiss the charges it must be silly 
season again if those people are making emotional hysterical 
comments about beer advertising said jim sanders president of 
the beer institute in washington 
however a 1987 study by the center for science in the public 
interest a washington health advocacy group found that black men 
have a 70 percent higher death rate from cirrhosis of the liver 
than whites 
the lung cancer rate has increased four times faster among 
blacks than among whites in the past 30 years according to reports 
from the american lung association and the national cancer 
institute 
rep john lewis dga recently introduced legislation to 
prohibit additional billboards on highways built with federal money 
the control of billboards is an environmental and public 
health issue he said 
this marketing strategy is outrageous and immoral said 
harold p freeman director of surgery at harlem hospital in new 
york and national president of the american cancer society the 
cigarette industry just wants to make money because they know that 
poor and uneducated people are their main customers and black 
people are disproportionately poor and uneducated 
according to the federal department of health and human 
services 406 percent of black men age 20 or older smoke compared 
with 318 percent of white men 318 percent of black women smoke 
compared with 283 percent of white women 
tobacco companies say people who see their billboards can make 
their own decisions about whether to light up 
to suggest that somehow minorities are more susceptible to 
our ads is horrible said steve weiss a spokesman for philip 
morris companies inc that argument is at best reprehensible and 
at worst racist we advertise our cigarettes to anyone who smokes 
regardless of race or background adults who smoke in this country 
are making an informed choice 
the beer institutes sanders suggested that if the numbers of 
beer ads in minority neighborhoods looked disproportionate it was 
because other industries do not advertise in such neighborhoods 
with equal fervor 
the beer industry was one of the first industries to respond 
to calls by blacks to use black models when advertising in their 
neighborhoods sanders said 
surveys across the country show black communities have much more 
tobacco and alcohol advertising than white one 
a survey this year by the detroit free press found that 
advertisements for cigarettes and alcohol accounted for nearly 43 
percent of detroits innercity billboards but only 25 percent of 
billboards on the outskirts of the city 
in st louis more than 62 percent of billboards in black 
neighborhoods advertisted cigarettes and alcohol in white 
neighborhoods it was 36 percent the 1987 survey prompted the city 
council to ban the construction of new billboards 
in the united states as a whole consumption of tobacco liquor 
and wine is on the decline 
according to impact magazine a trade publication for the 
alcoholic beverage industry consumption of liquor and wine fell 9 
percent from 1980 to 1987 from 931 million gallons to 847 million 
gallons 
cigarette consumption dropped 11 percent between 1980 and 1988 
to 5625 billion cigarettes from 6315 billion according to the 
department of agriculture 
the decline is not for lack of trying on the advertisers part 
combined contracts from the alcohol and tobacco industries 
accounted for 332 percent of outdoor advertising contracts in 
1988 or 4715 million according to the institute of outdoor 
advertising

wheat futures prices rose moderately friday on 
the chicago board of trade reflecting expectations for new export 
sales of the grain 
corn and soybean futures were narrowly mixed in a day of 
lackluster trading 
expectations are running high that the agriculture department 
will soon offer us wheat to china at subsidized prices the 
soviet union is also rumored to be shopping for wheat 
that kind of talk kept the wheat market bubbling around and 
well supported said dale gustafson an analyst with drexel 
burnham lambert inc in chicago 
the usdas rejection overnight of a soviet bid for 200000 
metric tons of soybean meal was a disappointment to the market but 
spain was known to be seeking soybeans while pakistan and mexico 
are expected to tender next week for large shipments of wheat and 
corn analysts said 
at the close of trading wheat futures were 1 cents to 4 cents 
higher with december at 405 a bushel corn futures were 1 cent 
lower to 1 cents higher with december at 239 a bushel oats 
were unchanged to cent higher with december at 145 a bushel 
soybeans were 1 cents lower to 2 cents higher with november at

the bush administration saying it wants 
to protect consumers by ensuring competition among businesses 
announced friday it would toughen enforcement of federal antitrust 
laws 
as part of the administrations antitrust policy officials will 
pursue stiffer penalties for violators will give more scrutiny to 
business mergers and will expand efforts to see where companies 
threaten to form cartels 
the federal trade commission is committed to promoting 
consumer welfare and where we cant we will exercise the 
appropriate selfrestraint said janet steiger chairwoman of the 
federal agency 
but selfrestraint is not a euphemism for comatose she said 
ms steiger and james rill assistant attorney general in charge 
of the justice departments antitrust division presented their 
views to a group of lawyers attending a conference at harvard law 
school 
their speeches marked the first time the bush administration has 
outlined its antitrust policy to the public 
rill pointed to the health care and airline industries in 
particular as areas that will receive more attention from the 
antitrust division 
the fact is that antitrust is critical to the wellbeing of 
the american economy and plays a vital role in the governing 
process rill said policies may evolve but the voice of 
competition cannot be quieted 
the reagan administration which espoused freemarket economic 
and business policies was widely considered lax in enforcing 
federal antitrust law a stance critics say was a key factor in the 
merger mania of the 1980s 
some might suggest that where government once bared its teeth 
to business it now buries its head in sand ms steiger said 
while she said some of the criticism has been unjust she also 
said her agency will be increasingly vigilant in assessing proposed 
mergers 
i have no empirical evidence to suggest that the ftc is 
bypassing good merger cases ms steiger said nevertheless i 
do not close the door on the possibility that the ftc may have been 
overly cautious in its case selection efforts and i think it 
behooves us constantly to reassess our techniques and methods of 
analysis 
ms steiger said her agency would give special attention to 
mergers within industries where a small number of companies control 
a large part of the market 
also the ftc plans to expand enforcement in nonmerger 
activities this includes investigating whether trade associations 
hurt competition by acting as cartels and looking at ways 
companies might try to force their rivals out of business she said 
rill said the justice department would take similar measures 
while i have no intention of a major revision of the merger 
guidelines i want to know if in practice the divisions merger 
standards are conducive to consistent and reliable results he 
said 
a key part in the antitrust agenda will be supporting tougher 
criminal penalties 
rill noted that antitrust fines cannot exceed 1 million for 
corporate violators but he supports proposed legislation that 
would raise the maximum to 10 million 
the current statutory maximum fines do not present a 
sufficient deterrent to antitrust crime he said 
rill also said no industries will be exempt from criminal 
enforcement and he singled out health care providers 
health care providers have always been subject to antitrust 
jurisdiction and investigation but they have rarely been 
prosecuted he said this has led to a complacency within the 
profession that cannot be permitted to persist 
it is critical that health care professionals conduct 
themselves in a manner that allows maximum competition within the 
industry rill said 
the justice department also will pay increased attention to 
recently deregulated industries such as airlines rill said 
under new federal rules airlines have become subject to 
essentially the same antitrust laws that govern other industries 
he said 
rill said his office has already taken an active stance toward 
proposed ventures between airline companies and in some cases the 
plans were dropped as an example he noted that the justice 
department opposed plans by eastern airlines to sell airport gates 
in philadelphia to usair group inc and consequently eastern 
abandoned the plan and sold the gates to midway airlines

a new york investment banking firm on 
friday acquired a majority stake in kindercare learning centers 
inc and said it has offered to buy out the nations largest 
daycare center operator 
in a proposal made thursday lodestar group offered 6 per 
share or 114 million for the kindercare learning centers stock 
it didnt already own 
the total cost of acquiring kindercare learning centers would 
come to 273 million after adding the 159 million lodestar already 
spent to amass 63 percent of the companys outstanding common stock 
the companys board of directors will hold its regular meeting 
wednesday and could consider the lodestar offer at that time said 
sharon rives director of investor relations for kindercare 
learning centers 
two lodestar executives ken miller and tull gearreald are 
expected to be given seats on the board at next weeks meeting 
miller is the investment banking firms president and chief 
executive officer and gearreald is lodestars vice chairman 
ms rives said lodestar began buying stock in the daycare 
company after it was spun off from kindercare inc of montgomery 
in a corporate restructuring in may 
prior to the restructuring she said kindercare inc owned 87 
percent of the common stock in the learning centers 
kindercare decided to liquidate its interest in the learning 
centers so the two companies could go their separate ways ms 
rives said 
lodestar as part of the corporate restructuring was allowed to 
purchase all outstanding stock in kindercare learning centers that 
was not bought by kindercare inc stockholders 
the investment banking firm on friday obtained more than 26 
million shares of outstanding stock bringing its holding in the 
company to 63 percent of the common stock outstanding 
however lodestar will need the boards approval to purchase 
additional stock if the offer is approved kindercare learning 
centers would be taken private 
they must go to the board in order to purchase any other 
stock ms rives said of lodestar that was a part of the 
restructuring agreement up front 
if the shareholders dont want that then well keep our 63 
plus percent and everybody will go on gearreald said in a 
telephone interview from new york city 
the proposed sale would include sylvan learning centers which 
became part of kindercare learning centers under the restructuring 
kindercare learning centers consists of 1260 daycare centers 
in 40 states and canada sylvan learning centers operates 418 
franchise and 27 companyowned facilities that offer additional

the stock market drifted aimlessly today in a 
muted response to a strongerthanexpect report on employment 
the labor department reported this morning that nonfarm payroll 
employment increased by 233000 in october as the civilian 
unemployment rate held steady at 53 percent 
advance estimates on wall street had called for a gain of not 
much more than 150000 
that came as a setback to some faint hopes in the financial 
world that the federal reserve might take the employment data as a 
cue to relax its credit policy further 
however analysts noted that details of the report continued to 
show weakness in the manufacturing sector of the economy some 
observers said the chances of easing by the fed did not appear to 
be drastically changed

chrysler corp announced the layoffs of 4000 
workers friday in a series of moves that included ending production 
of two subcompact cars in detroit eliminating a shift at a 
carmaking plant in st louis and closing a supply plant in 
wisconsin 
the moves are part of a chrysler plan announced earlier this 
year to slash 1 billion of the companys annual 26 billion budget 
by the end of 1990 
i guess chrysler chairman lee iacocca was serious when he 
said he saw a recession coming independent auto analyst dave 
healy said from new york city 
chrysler said it would 
furlough 1700 hourly workers at its jefferson avenue assembly 
plant in detroit when it ends production of its slowselling 
omnihorizon subcompact cars in february 1990 the fate of 250 
salaried employees at the plant was undetermined spokesman doug 
nicoll said 
eliminate one shift about 1900 hourly workers at its st 
louis no 1 assembly plant which makes the slowselling lebaron 
and daytona sports cars 
close its parts subsidiary acustar and a wireharness operation 
in coleman wis permanently laying off 400 hourly and salaried 
workers 
the work force in detroit was stunned by the news 
many united auto workers local 7 members at the jefferson plant 
began working there after being laid off from other chrysler 
factories jobs they obtained by bumping workers with less 
seniority local leaders said they would talk with international 
uaw officials this weekend about reversing the companys decision 
to close the plant 
chrysler at first indicated it would close the jefferson plant 
in 1992 the same year a 1 billion replacement plant in detroit is 
to open the new factory will make sportutility vehicles and many 
of the jefferson workers could be recalled for training to work 
there beginning in fall 1991 nicoll said the new plant will 
employ up to 3000 people 
industry analysts said the greatest impact of fridays moves 
would be on the companys ability to meet corporate average fuel 
economy cafe standards mandated by the federal government 
the omnihorizon cars were not big moneymakers for chrysler but 
their average fuel economy of 26 miles per gallon in the city and 
35 miles on the highway helped balance the no 3 automakers gas 
guzzlers some of which fell below the 1990 cafe of 275 miles per 
gallon 
it raises the question of how theyre going to meet the 
government gas mileage requirements healy said the 
omnihorizon was getting long in the tooth it had been around for 
a long time so for today it probably wasnt a bad business 
decision 
analyst joseph phillippi of shearson lehman hutton inc in new 
york said he thinks chrysler may try to reclaim some of that lost 
fuel economy by making a version of its compact dodge 
shadowplymouth sundance models 
chrysler said friday it would shift its marketing emphasis to 
the shadowsundance line but nicoll offered no details of what was 
planned by way of incentives on the cars or new offerings 
the st louis shift elimination followed the uaw rejection this 
week of a fourday 40hour work week at st louis no 2 where 
chryslers popular minivans are assembled chrysler wanted to 
eliminate overtime in its minivan production and said 1000 to 
1300 of the workers facing layoff at st louis no 1 could have 
been absorbed into the minivan production under the rejected 
scheduling proposal 
the uaw guys voted with their pocketbooks they didnt want to 
give up the overtime phillippi said 
the closing of the acustar plant comes nearly two years after 
chrysler tried to sell its parts subsidiary uaw outrage at the 
time led chrysler to abandon the attempts to dump acustar and move 
to outside sources for its parts 
the closing of the wireharness production plant will force 
chrysler to buy electronic wiring for its vehicles either from 
competitors or from another outside source electronic wiring is 
among the most laborintensive jobs in automaking

many of mexicos foreign creditors are opting 
to reduce their outstanding loans to the nation rather than make 
new ones the government newspaper el nacional said friday 
mexico is awaiting responses from about 500 private foreign 
banks to a debt reduction plan that offers the banks several 
options including accepting cuts in interest or principal or 
making new loans 
the agreement reached in july deals with the 527 billion of 
the 107 billion debt mexico owes to foreign private banks 
the el nacional report attributed to banking sources said most 
of the major japanese creditors will opt for cutting principal by 
35 percent on mexican debt 
mexicos agreement in principle with the steering committee of 
15 creditor banks reached july 24 was seen as a test of bush 
administration policy for reducing third world debt and as a 
milestone for other debtor countries waiting to renegotiate 
under the agreement each bank has three options a 35 percent 
reduction in principle reduction of the interest rate on its loans 
to 625 percent from the current average of about 10 percent or 
providing new loans equal to 25 percent of what mexico owes the 
bank 
those banks willing to reduce principal or cut the interest 
charged will be able to get guarantees on the remaining debt from 
the international monetary fund and the world bank the two 
multinational lending agencies that are backing the 
administrations debt strategy 
when the agreement was reached with the new yorkbased bank 
committee mexican negotiators said they expected about 80 percent 
of the banks to accept a reduction in principal or interest rather 
than provide new funds 
el nacional said an analysis of replies from 120 banks showed 
most picking the reduction options rather than increasing their 
loans to mexico but gave no breakdown 
the deadline for the banks to choose their options under the 
agreement was friday night el nacional said 
in new york one banker said many banks have not decided what to 
do yet because the mexican deal is very complicated and requires 
careful analysis some need more time others have to get a 
decision approved at a board of directors meeting 
but the banking source said we should have a pretty good 
reading by late next week the feeling is that the deal will get 
done 
he commented that as expected there seems to be increased 
interest in banks wanting to take debt principal reduction bonds 
rather than the interest reduction option this helps because to 
the extent that this happens it means mexico needs less new money

coniston partners always has had a soft spot for 
united airlines 
the aggressive new york investment partnership scored its 
biggest hit in 1987 when the airlines former parent allegis 
corp decided to restructure selling its nonairline businesses 
paying a special dividend and buying back its shares more than two 
years ago 
allegis undertook the restructuring largely because the partners 
paul e tierney keith gollust and augustus oliver acquired a 
big block of its shares and threatened to fight for control of the 
board of directors to force a breakup of the company 
coniston pocketed 460 million for themselves and their 
wellheeled clients as a result of the restructuring 
so should not have been necessarily surprising that the trio 
surfaced friday with a 97 percent stake in takeover target ual 
corp uniteds current parent and said it would attempt to take 
over the companys board to engineer a profitable takeover or 
restructuring 
historically however coniston has not sought out companies 
that others have already put into play the trio prefers to 
identify undervalued companies quietly amass enough stock to twist 
some arms and then press for changes that will boost the share 
price and the value of conistons investment 
the tactic called strategic block investing netted 
coniston 44 million when gillette co agreed last year to buy back 
conistons 16 million shares after the partners narrowly lost a 
proxy fight for four seats on the companys board 
besides gillette their successes have included storer 
communications where coniston made about 39 million in a 1985 
leveraged buyout the partnership also made a quick 60 million by 
selling its 12 percent stake in viacom international when the 
company was acquired by national amusements in 1987 
this year coniston went so far out of character as to actually 
acquire one of its targets in june the partners took over tw 
services inc which controls thousands of dennys and hardees 
fast food restaurants among others for 165 billion 
but the deal ran into serious difficulties last week when the 
junk bond market gave it the cold shoulder investors werent 
lining up to buy some 115 billion in highrisk junk bonds needed 
to finance the deal 
although the restaurants are growing investors were concerned 
over how they would fare in a recession coniston and its 
investment bankers were forced back to the drawing board to 
restructure the terms 
the three partners arent the only ones to win when coniston 
sells out at a profit coniston operates a handful of investment 
funds and requires interested parties to put up a minimum 5 
million to participate 
last years estimates pegged the average return at more than 35 
percent a year and put conistons warchest at roughly 700 million 
in addition to making money the trio has been highly publicized 
for its unconventional casual style and ability to corral greed 
one principal might sport jeans around the office while another 
spends his lunch hour on his 10speed bicycle racing around nearby 
central park 
and unlike the stereotypical investment banker at least one of 
the partners supported a democratic presidential candidate michael 
dukakis

dow jones amp co inc has agreed to pay about 
672 million for the onethird interest in telerate inc it does 
not already own 
dow jones said late thursday that it has agreed to boost its 
tender offer to 21 a share from 18 for the approximately 32 
million telerate shares that it does not already own 
its earlier offer for new yorkbased telerate a financial 
information company had been valued at about 576 million 
in trading friday on the new york stock exchange telerate was 
up 125 a share at 2075 
a special committee of telerates board of directors had 
rejected the 18ashare offer from dow jones as inadequate but 
telerate and dow jones have been conducting private talks on the 
offer over the past few days 
late thursday dow jones said that it and the special committee 
had reached an agreement in principle on the new offer 
neil s hirsch president and chief executive office of telerate 
and the owner of about 6 percent of the outstanding shares said he 
supports the deal 
on friday dow jones and telerate said they had approved a 
definitive merger agreement and said the new tender offer would 
expire nov 20 
peter skinner a vice president and general counsel for dow 
jones said he expects the deal will probably be completed in early 
1990 
dow jones publishes the wall street journal and barrons 
magazine and provides a variety of financial news services and data 
bases telerate provides financial information via computer screens 
that are used in brokerage houses and elsewhere 
warren phillips chairman and chief executive of dow jones had 
said in launching the offer that integrating the companies would 
mean operational efficiencies and permit closer and more efficient 
working relationships in marketing customer service and the 
management of their related businesses

gte corp accepted an undisclosed cash sum to 
settle its twoyear legal battle with home shopping network inc 
with both sides saying friday it was too expensive to keep fighting 
over a 100 million jury award 
gtes gte florida and gte communications units won the libel and 
slander award in august after a circuit court jury rejected hsns 
15 billion suit claiming gte provided ineffective telephone 
equipment and service 
under terms of the settlement the companies agreed to end all 
litigation and release claims against each other hsn had been 
mounting an appeal of the jury award a process company officials 
say could have taken up to five years to resolve 
its already been two years now that weve been knocking each 
others brains out and i think both companies realized its time 
to put this behind us said nando difillippo hsn vice president 
and executive counsel to take it through the appeal and possible 
retrial would have continued to tie up our top management and could 
have cost us 1 million to 15 million 
james v cariedo gte florida vice president and general 
counsel said the company had made its point and it was time to 
move on 
this matter has been concluded with the integrity and 
reputation of gte and its employees reaffirmed our vindication is 
complete he said gte believes it is in the companys best 
interest to eliminate any further expense and use of resources with 
respect this litigation 
while the amount of the settement was not disclosed company 
officials did say it was negligible compared to the 100 million 
jury award 
remember this began with hsn seeking 1 billion and it became 
a matter of quibbling over a relatively small amount said larry 
gerbrant an analyst who has followed the case for the media 
research concern paul kagan amp associates in carmel calif 
all that really matters to gte is the fact that they won a 
huge moral victory he said the verdict in this case came as a 
stunning surprise 
hsn had claimed it lost millions of calls and 500 million in 
potential sales in 1986 and early 1987 because the gte telephone 
equipment it contracted for couldnt handle the volume of calls 
hsn merchandise may be bought by home television viewers only 
while the item is being dispayed on the screen hsn said it lost 42 
million calls when as many as half of its incoming calls never 
reached waiting sales operators 
the jury rejected hsns claims and agreed with gtes countersuit 
that the video retailer was blaming the phone company for financial 
problems that were actually caused by mismanagement 
in another development friday clearwaterbased hsn reported it 
lost 261 million or 29 cents a share in the quarter ended aug 
31 compared with net income of 33 million or 4 cents a share a 
year ago 
its fourthquarter revenue rose 115 percent to 1874 million 
from 1681 million a year ago 
for the year hsn lost 149 million or 17 cents per share in 
contrast to net income of 18 million or 21 cents a share in the 
previous year 
revenue for the year rose 61 percent to 7743 million from 
7301 million a year ago 
hsn chairman roy speer attributed the loss to reducing or 
eliminating subsidiaries to focus on video retailing

braniff inc cut about 100 jobs friday in 
further costcutting measures as the carrier struggles to emerge 
from bankruptcy for a second time 
the layoffs mostly affecting administrative positions in 
braniffs orlando headquarters come about five weeks after the 
carrier filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors 
and announced plans to cut about 2900 workers 
braniff which claimed weekly losses of about 15 million 
before filing for bankruptcy sept 28 lost 318 million on 
revenue of 293 million in the first six months of the year 
these layoffs were anticipated and are not very dramatic 
companywide said braniff spokeswoman sandy smith but here in 
orlando its very emotional 
ms smith said the layoffs are effective immediately and leave 
about 1800 braniff employees including 750 in kansas city mo 
550 in dallas and 250 in orlando where the carrier relocated its 
headquarters from dallas in may 
there are no immediate plans for additional layoffs said ms 
smith 
braniff which operated 46 of its 256 prebankruptcy flights 
friday was the first major carrier to file for bankruptcy 
following airline deregulation in the early 1980s it emerged as a 
smaller carrier in 1984 
meanwhile braniff is preparing to submit salary plans in 
bankruptcy court for its 22 top executives 
a hearing is scheduled nov 17 in us bankruptcy court in 
orlando and ms smith said the carrier will likely submit reduced 
pay plans for the executives which earned a total of nearly 3 
million last year 
the highest prebankruptcy annual salary was 442000 for 
william mcgee braniffs president and chief executive officer he 
is among 14 company officials who earned more than 100000 a year 
how can they afford to pay 400000 to mcgee when they owe 
people three weeks worth of pay said rebecca guardado the wife 
of a laidoff braniff mechanic eight families could live off of 
that very well 
many of the laidoff employees are owed several weeks of pay for 
work performed before the bankruptcy filing and are considered 
unsecured creditors under bankruptcy provisions they could 
receive a portion of what they are owed 
the argument could be made that the top officials are working 
harder now that theyre in bankruptcy than before that if they 
didnt receive what they were worth they would leave said david 
mcfarlin an orlando lawyer representing several corporate 
creditors im not buying that argument but it could be made 
mcfarlin said most creditors will await the revised salary 
figures before deciding whether to challenge the pay plan 
ms smith said it has not been determined how much the 
executives annual pay will be decreased they will come up with 
reduced figures by nov 17 she said 
scott hamilton editor of the dallasbased commercial aviation 
report said braniff needs 50 million to 100 million to operate 
on a longterm basis and could run out of cash sometime this month 
i think executive salaries will all be a moot point very 
shortly he said frankly im surprised braniff is still 
flying

gold gave back some of its recent gains friday but analysts said 
the market did not appear to be significantly weakened by the dip 
on other commodity markets oil futures prices rallied 
porkbelly futures rose for the fifth straight day and grain and 
soybean futures were mixed 
gold settled 170 to 190 lower on new yorks commodity 
exchange with the contract for delivery in december at 381 a troy 
ounce silver finished 25 cents to 3 cents lower with december at 
526 a troy ounce 
gold was trading below 365 a month ago and has strengthened 
substantially since the oct 13 stock market collapse 
analysts have attributed golds climb to jittery investors 
seeking a safe haven for their dollars but the stock market was 
quiet friday and gold prices stalled early in the day after rising 
above 385 
i dont know if it was profittaking or what but its acting a 
little toppish said scott hinton a metals analyst with elders 
futures inc in new york 
the labor departments report that unemployment held steady at 
53 percent last month indicated a stronger economy than some 
traders had expected and helped to support the dollar which may 
have prompted some gold sales 
but analysts said the markets fundamentals remained bullish 
overall with the dollar still in a downward trend and the federal 
reserve unlikely to tighten interest rates in the near future 
dips in the market do not necessarily signal an end to the 
rally they said although a drop below 375 an ounce in the 
december gold contract would probably trigger a big wave of selling 
as long as it holds above 375 it has a bullish bias said 
fred demler metals economist with drexel burnham lambert inc in 
new york 
most oil futures advanced on the new york mercantile exchange 
led by crude oils rebound late in the session from thursdays 
moderate losses 
recent reports indicate that members of the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries are continuing to produce crude in 
excess of their selfimposed limits but fridays estimates 
suggested the overproduction was not as extreme as had previously 
been thought 
west texas intermediate crude settled 11 cents to 20 cents 
higher with december at 2021 a barrel heating oil was 09 cent 
to 17 cent higher with december at 6012 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 07 cent lower to 60 cent higher with december at 
5213 cents a gallon 
porkbelly futures continued their sharp ascent on the chicago 
mercantile exchange bolstered by strong demand and expectations 
for more export business the united states and poland signed an 
agreement friday that will send up to 10 million worth of pork 
bellies to poland 
cattle futures gained on book balancing ahead of the weekend 
live cattle futures finished unchanged to 45 cent higher with 
december at 7417 cents a pound feeder cattle were 10 cent lower 
to 40 cent higher with november at 8285 cents a pound live hogs 
were 22 cent lower to 30 cent higher with december at 4695 cents 
a pound frozen pork bellies were 15 cent lower to 88 cent higher 
with february at 5960 cents a pound 
wheat futures rose moderately on the chicago board of trade 
reflecting expectations for new export sales of the grain corn and 
soybean futures were narrowly mixed 
expectations are running high that the agriculture department 
will soon offer us wheat to china at subsidized prices the 
soviet union is also rumored to be shopping for wheat 
wheat was 1 cents to 3 cents higher with december at 405 a 
bushel corn was 1 cents lower to 1 cents higher with december at 
240 a bushel oats were unchanged to cent higher with december 
at 145 a bushel soybeans were 1 cent lower to 2 cents higher 
with november at 569 a bushel

energy futures finished mixed friday after a 
lackluster week as analysts said sluggish demand pushed gasoline 
lower 
on the new york mercantile exchange the december contract for 
west texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude oil 
rose 20 cents to end at 2021 a 42gallon barrel 
the contract gained 44 cents on the week up from 1977 a week 
earlier 
the market continues to mark time prior to the upcoming opec 
meeting now three weeks away said andrew lebow senior broker 
with edampf man international futures inc 
among refined products traded on the exchange heating oil also 
closed the week stronger the december contract rose 013 cent to 
6012 cents a gallon while the january contract advanced 011 cent 
to 5976 cents 
meanwhile wholesale unleaded gasoline for december delivery 
lost 007 cent to 5213 cents a gallon 
gasoline is squarely on the defensive because we have come out 
of the gasoline season with ample gasoline supplies and sluggish 
demand lebow said 
a report that the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
is continuing to produce oil at a brisk rate might have added a 
bullish slant to the crude market said peter beutel energy 
analyst with elders futures inc 
the international energy agency in a report released friday 
estimated that opec produced 229 million barrels a day last month 
up from a revised 224 million barrels in september 
although the estimate put opec production at well above its 
current selfimposed ceiling of 205 million barrels a day beutel 
said other estimates had put opec production even higher

the surprising economic strength to begin the fourth quarter 
which came despite the seventh consecutive monthly decline in 
manufacturing was largely attributed to continued local 
government hiring for the school year

sony corp chairman akio morita said friday he is 
concerned about japan bashing in the afternmath of sonys 
takeover of columbia pictures entertainment inc and other japanese 
acquisitions in the united states 
morita told business leaders that some us officials are using 
the 34 billion deal as an excuse to paint the japanese as 
villains trying to buy americas soul 
i have a very serious concern over this morita said 
earlier this week mitsubishi estate co acquired 51 percent of 
rockefeller group inc which owned the symbolic business and 
tourist center in the heart of manhattan for 846 million 
in a speech to the japan america society of georgia and later at 
a meeting with reporters morita asked why japanese investments in 
the america are regarded as sensational while us business 
deals involving other nations are accepted 
he said the columbia acquisition as well as sonys 2 billion 
buyout of cbs records in 1988 should be considered simply as good 
business deals he said sony did not buy the companies to make a 
quick buck 
morita said japanese companies want to be good citizens when 
they invest in america he said he hoped such efforts would end an 
apparent feeling among some politicians that criticizing japanese 
businesses can win votes 
if japan is regarded as a real friend if somebody bashes 
japan he will lose popularity morita said 
morita said sonys interest in columbia and cbs was based on the 
belief that producing software such as records and movies would 
enhance its electronics hardware business 
he said the entertainment companies will remain largely run by 
americans morita also said sony does not intend to interfere with 
the creative process in the entertainment business 
morita said that any loss in competitiveness the united states 
has experienced in global trade has less to do with japanese 
investments than shortsightedness by us industry 
at times we see some american corporate executives more 
interested in quick profits busily trying to make the bottom line 
of quarterly reports their concern is for the amount of profit 
they can set aside for return to the shareholders he said 
although this concern should not altogether be criticized an

the investment group coniston partners entered 
the buyout fray for ual corp on friday announcing plans to fight 
for control of the airline company in a strategy that mirrored its 
successful 1987 bustup of uals former parent 
a group led by the new yorkbased coniston said it had acquired 
a 97 percent stake in ual the beleaguered parent of united 
airlines and intended to seek control of the board of directors in 
order to possibly force a sale restructuring or other transaction 
to boost uals stock price 
ual stock buffeted in recent weeks by takeover winds finished 
up 1175 at 18475 a share in new york stock exchange trading 
airline industry analysts have been waiting for the next move in 
the protracted battle for ual which they predict could take months 
to resolve 
this is no big surprise said edward starkman airline 
analyst for painewebber inc in new york it was just a matter of 
who was going to carry the flag to do it 
coniston which has spent roughly 333 million for 212 million 
ual shares wants to cut uals board from 16 to five members three 
of whom would be coniston principals it said in a filing with the 
securities and exchange commission 
if successful in swaying shareholders to its plan coniston 
would be able to steer the company toward a sale restructuring or 
recapitalization 
we would like to see an extraordinary transaction of some kind 
take place that would bring stability to the company and be fair to 
various constituencies coniston principal paul tierney said 
tierney said uals unions had been approached and that we 
would like to strike a transaction that is good for employees 
both union and nonunion 
the union representing uniteds pilots has been unhappy with its 
parent since 1986 when ual attempted to become a total travel 
conglomerate the pilots have been trying to buy the airline ever 
since 
leaders of the united pilots union local said conistons goals 
appeared to be consistent with their own but they said no 
ownership change or financial restructuring of ual would occur 
without their support 
interested investors should clearly understand that the 
pilots intend to achieve majority ownership of united frederick 
dubinsky chairman of the united chapter of the air line pilots 
association said in a statement 
the coniston disclosure follows a move wednesday by another 
player new york investor saul steinberg who sought federal 
antitrust clearance to buy more than 15 percent and less than 25 
percent of ual a spokesman for steinberg said friday that 
steinberg would have no comment on conistons action 
theres no way of giving odds as to whether theyll succeed 
robert joedicke an analyst for shearson lehman hutton inc said 
of conistons move the question is how much support theyll get 
from stockholders and arbitrageurs 
ual did not comment friday on the latest news in the takeover 
battle which began in august when billionaire oilman marvin davis 
offered 240 a share for the company 
a group of ual pilots and top managers then offered 300 a share 
in a 675 billion buyout proposal which was accepted by the 
companys board but collapsed when the group was unable to obtain 
financing 
news of that collapse helped send stock prices tumbling oct 13 
when the dow jones average of 30 industrials plunged 190 points 
ual stock has gyrated wildly since the battle began reaching a 
high of 294 
coniston which has made its money buying into companies 
instigating changes and then selling its shares played a key role 
two years ago in the breakup of travel conglomerate allegis corp 
former parent of united 
coniston reaped about 460 million when allegis bought back 
shares after agreeing to sell its westin and hilton international 
hotel chains and hertz car rental business 
we believe this is a great franchise tierney said of united 
friday its an airline which has taken meaningful strides 
forward in the last few years theres no intention here to break 
up the company or sell it through liquidation we want to see it 
grow and stabilize
