tourists anticipating a 
vacation weekend in majestic yosemite national park saw their plans 
go up in smoke friday as lightningsparked fires ravaged thousands 
of acres 
an estimated 10000 people were held inside the park overnight 
because fires blocked roads in and out of the preserve they were 
escorted out friday morning some just ended their travels early 
and headed home and others headed elsewhere 
fires triggered by more than 21000 lightning strikes during the 
week burned more than 100000 acres across california including 
12000 acres and 66 structures in yosemite by friday initial 
estimates of the number of buildings consumed by the fires was much 
lower but after an inspection friday officials determined many 
more had burned 
a national guard helicopter crashed friday evening while the 
craft was scooping water out of a pond in tehama county where a 
wildfire was burning officials said one of the three crew members 
suffered minor injuries they said 
they suspect that it may have been engine failure said 
national guard major patricia antosh the crew was able to 
evacuate themselves through the cockpit and get to shore 
the aircraft remained twothirds submerged with the tail section 
down according to antosh 
norbert and edith fischer of mission viejo calif had planned 
to spend two days in yosemite which is observing its 100th 
birthday this year instead they decided to move on to sequoia 
national park 170 miles to the south 
im a lot disappointed because i read a chapter about it in my 
social studies book said their 10yearold daughter lori the 
teacher told me to go up and see it now i cant see it 
her father promised to drive the 300 miles from los angeles back 
to the park again hopefully next year 
besides the yosemite fires a fire in northern californias 
tehama county had burned 39000 acres and one in the sequoia 
national forest affected 17000 
fires also raged in parts of idaho oregon montana nevada 
utah and washington state nearly 16000 lightning strikes were 
reported in the western states in 24 hours according to the boise 
interagency fire center in idaho which coordinates fire control 
efforts the center said 19000 firefighters were at work in the 
west 
three villages in the yosemite area were evacuated at various 
times and 66 structures burned in one of them known as foresta 
in the merced river canyon most of the structures were probably 
summer cabins said lisa boyd spokeswoman at the state department 
of forestry and fire protection command center in sacramento 
many people were anxious to leave yosemite on friday because 
most lights were out in the valley thursday night some people 
unable to get back to their campsites had to sleep on makeshift 
beds on hotel floors or in their cars 
i felt sorry for people up just for the day who couldnt get 
out said joe salazar of santa fe springs calif there were 
lines and lines of traffic trying to get out of the valley weve 
been coming here for 17 years from the driest to the wettest ive 
never seen so much lightning 
his wife vivian said the experience of vacationing behind fire 
lines was interesting it was also frightening though 
rachel chang and michael zheng of fremont calif slept in 
their car in yosemite valley for two nights after the road to their 
campground was closed after they were escorted out they returned 
to the gate to ask how they could retrieve their tent sleeping 
bags and clothes 
park ranger kevin mcmillan advised them to sit tight and keep 
waiting he took changs name address and telephone number 
i know its a big inconvenience but weve got to be glad we 
dont have people trapped up there mcmillan said 
salazar said he would return to the park some day 
by the time i come back theyll have trees again he said 
elsewhere in the west government land managers in southern 
idaho banned campfires and smoking outside of campgrounds beginning 
at midnight sunday in washington state the department of natural 
resources banned all outdoor burning in pierce mason and kitsap 
counties to reduce the risk of forest fires 
a 60000acre range fire had ripped an 18milelong path through 
sagebrush and grass about 35 miles northeast of twin falls in 
southern idaho 
it looked like a cyclone with black clouds and a wall of flame 
rising about a thousand feet in the air said bureau of land 
management spokesman dale chatterton 
a 73700acre complex of fires in oregon had burned to within 
one mile of the town of riley and within three miles northwest of 
burns a town of about 3000 and its southern neighbor hines a 
town of about 1500 officials said 
the few residents of riley were evacuated wednesday night 
burns is still prepared for an immediate evacuation but for 
the moment it doesnt appear to be necessary fire information 
officer don jackson said friday 
there were nearly 1000 people battling the fires friday morning 
and officials said two 500member battalions from the armys 1st 
division were scheduled to arrive in burns during the weekend

like shifting desert sand boundaries in 
the middle east have changed through centuries of rule by persians 
greeks romans mongols and ottomans as well as arabs 
in this century colonial powers took part in setting borders 
that at times have led to violent disputes among them are 
conflicts between arabs and jews over the land known as palestine 
civil war in lebanon and iraqs invasion and annexation of kuwait 
kuwait is part of our country the iraqi government declared 
wednesday it said the spiteful pencil and scissors of 
imperialism had drawn maps years ago that were intended to 
prevent the unity of the arab people 
when islam came to iraq in the 7th century it had already 
experienced 3500 years of civilization including the babylonian 
empire led by hammurabi first codifier of laws 
baghdad was the center of the arab world from 750 until the 13th 
century when mongols sacked the city the turks absorbed the area 
into their ottoman empire 300 years later 
captured by britain in 1916 iraq became independent in 1932 a 
military coup in 1958 ended the monarchy iraqs current president 
saddam hussein came to power in 1979 also after a coup 
as for kuwait in the southeast corner on the persian gulf 
mongols arab caliphs and ottomans took turns as overlords in 
1899 the british became dominant 
sheik jaber alahmed alsabah who fled to saudi arabia during 
the iraqi invasion aug 2 is a member of a clan that ruled under 
the ottomans and british after settling there in 1756 kuwait 
gained independence in 1961 
kuwait was threatened then by an iraqi claim to sovereignty over 
the territory british troops responded at the request of the emir 
but the arab league met and organized a force to replace them in 
september 1961 parts of the force remained until early 1963 
great care was taken in the drawing of many of the borders 
especially where oil was concerned but stories abound of the 
haphazard way in which other boundaries were formed 
according to one story when winston churchhill was drawing 
jordans eastern border with saudi arabia his elbow was jogged 
forming an angular curve in the desert known as winstons elbow 
until islam swept the country in the 7th century saudi arabia 
was isolated and polytheistic the ottomans ruled the land for 300 
years until the british moved in during world war i and lawrence of 
arabia rallied the desert warriors to rise against the turks 
conquests of king ibn saud brought most of the arabian peninsula 
into the modern state formed in 1932 
but the peninsula was not firmly delineated it was not until 
march that saudi arabia and oman signed an accord drawing their 
border 
oman and the united arab emirates have been trying to settle a 
border dispute dating to the mid1970s 
bahrain and qatar have been at loggerheads over huwar a chain 
of flyspeck islands along the qatari coastline the dispute dates 
to the british colonial era before the two arab countries gained 
independence 
in 1603 iran occupied bahrain until it was expelled by forces 
led by the khalifa clan from arabia iranian and turkish claims 
forced the khalifas to seek british backing in 1861 
britain and the ottoman empire acknowledged bahrains 
independence in 1913 britain effectively administered the islands 
until full independence in 1968 iran once known as persia was 
the center of an empire under king cyrus in the 6th century bc 
alexander the great defeated the persians in 331 bc 
arab moslems later ruled for three centuries until defeated by 
the mongols in 1258 the safavids and qajars ruled in turn until 
1925 when they were overthrown by reza khan 
his son the late shah mohammad reza pahlavi ascended the 
throne in 1941 and was toppled in 1979 by the moslem fundamentalist 
revolution of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
nations still are being formed in the middle east 
earlier this year north and south yemen merged yemen however 
also has unresolved border disputes with saudi arabia and oman

the big machines lumber like 
mechanical dinosaurs across a rippling sienna plain churning 
clouds of dirt and pulverized wheat as they reap the last harvest 
of a vanishing nation 
like the clunky outdated combines they drive east germanys 
farmers are going through the motions breaking down occasionally 
but still pushing for the production quotas of the old communist 
government 
they are enjoying their best grain harvest ever and still 
raising beef poultry and pork some experts say production overall 
is down only a little some say it is actually higher 
but the old government no longer exists nor do the trusty 
distribution system and the state stores that had no choice but to 
take what the farmers grew 
gone too are up to 70 percent of their customers 
faster than any other the agricultural sector of east germanys 
economy is collapsing under the weight of competition about half 
the farms are technically bankrupt economists say 
livestock raised and fed now is often just slaughtered and 
stored vegetables carefully sown in the spring are rotting in the 
summer grain sits unsold in countless silos 
august is east germanys first harvest as a free nation and its 
last as a sovereign one for many of the 800000 farmers who work 
on the sovietstyle collectives that once fed a captive market of 
16 million people this is the last harvest period 
we cant sell anything said foreman frank simolka as he 
stood in a wheat field outside of this village four huge threshers 
thundering in the background 
we used to make about 70 marks 44 for 200 kilograms of 
wheat said simolka 27 now were offered 18 marks 11 what 
kind of salaries can you pay if you cant make any money 
schenkendorf is one several small brownandgray farm villages 
scattered in the district of koenigs wusterhausen a farm belt 
about 25 miles south of berlin that is among the hardest hit 
agricultural areas 
it is a city of muddyred roofs and cracked cobblestone streets 
at one end of the tiny downtown six miles from simolkas plant 
operation is a collection of stark gray buildings fortified by 
barbed wire and heavy gates 
farmer joachim dommisch said the complex used to be a prison 
camp for jews during world war ii now it is used as a dairy pork 
and poultry operation 
it is one of 11 collectives in the district eight of which are 
considered bankrupt said dommisch who is in charge of poultry 
production 
employment at the schenkendorf farm has dropped from 250 to 170 
since the economic merger of the germanys on july 1 when east 
germany became a free market 
all remaining workers have taken cuts of 60 to 120 from their 
former 566 monthly salaries he said 
dommisch said his operation is selling at most 60 percent of 
what it sold before july 1 
the slaughterhouses are jammed with chickens ducks pigs and 
cows he said 
dommisch said the collectives are selling goods in streets and 
at stands at cutrate prices aiming mostly for west germans who 
cruise farm areas looking for bargains 
paradoxically east german grocery stores are stocking western 
products and charging prices often higher than in west germany 
east german farmers are selling their goods when they can at much 
lower prices set by the free market 
dommisch blamed that on the retail profit margin that didnt 
exist under the former communist government which used to 
subsidize both the prices in the stores and the amounts paid to 
farmers 
but the collectives are typically too large inefficient and 
overstaffed to compete with betterrun western agricultural 
operations 
the old distribution system also has fallen apart 
dommisch said his farm used to have a distributor who carried 
products to 10 stores in east berlin now a distributor has to try 
40 stops just to get rid of a particular shipment 
cows that produce the least milk are routinely slaughtered to 
reduce feed costs he said 
his operation once got 113 for a liter of milk and now gets 38 
cents 
experts say it is only a matter of time before such pricing 
wipes out more than half the farm system 
walter schwarzer a spokesman for the east german agriculture 
department said the 820000member workforce will drop to 400000 
in two to three years 
andries kurjo a west berlin economist and expert on east german 
agriculture said half the 4500 collectives are technically 
bankrupt and onethird are meeting payrolls only because of a 
special threemonth government subsidy that ends in september 
he said several sectors such as sugar starch and mustard 
already have disappeared mustard for example dropped from 377 
for 220 pounds to 22 
the crash comes during a summer of good weather and a record 
grain harvest of 114 million tons 
a collective farm near the southeastern city of goerlitz has 
harvested 9500 tons of winter wheat this month but expects to sell 
a third of it said collective leader lothar wagner 
should we even bother to harvest it he asked 
many officials say farmers have to become independent and break 
up the collectives many farmers say they know no new ways and 
accuse the government of letting the system die 
there were 270000 jobless in east germany last month just over 
3 percent but unemployment is being kept low by a west 
germanfinanced program to retain workers at shorter hours and 
lower pay 
there are 656277 people in that program with the largest 
percentage 126 percent farmers

eleanor jordan was frightened when her 
2yearold daughter fell out of bed and broke her nose and jaw 
but her fear was more than a mothers concern for an injured child 
i didnt even want to take her to the doctor she said i 
was absolutely terrified because i knew what would happen 
she feared she would be charged with child abuse for the second 
time the broken nose and jaw narelle suffered two summers ago were 
her sixth and seventh fractures 
neither mrs jordan nor her doctor knew then that her daughter 
suffered from osteogenesis imperfecta a rare ailment also known as 
brittle bone disease 
the disease leads to frequent fractures but often is difficult 
to detect and the inability of many parents doctors and social 
workers to recognize its symptoms has led to charges of child abuse 
in a number of cases experts say 
the disease affects about 40000 people across the country said 
heidi glauser president of the osteogenesis imperfecta foundation 
about 500 members of the group are meeting this weekend in 
pittsburgh among the topics on the agenda are athletic 
conditioning for brittle bone patients their rights and research 
on the genetic cause of the disease whch leads to a lack of the 
protein collagen in bones 
about once every two months parents report to the organization 
that they have been accused of child abuse said mrs glauser of 
pittsburgh whose 7yearold son has the illness 
narelles fractures resulted from spills and tumbles common to 
toddlers 
her parents of norwood mass did not learn about osteogenesis 
imperfecta until after more than a year of trips to hospitals 
visits from police and investigations by social workers a doctor 
suspected the disease and sent narelle to a geneticist who 
confirmed it in early 1989 through a tissue test 
mrs jordan remains bitter about the treatment her family 
received she blames many especially doctors and social workers 
i still go crazy because the medical profession could be so 
ignorant and put us through the hell they did she said thursday 
here i was thinking everybody was on our side going to help us 
and nobody was going to do anything except accuse us of child 
abuse 
authorities placed narelle under the care of mrs jordans 
mother for several days in 1987 after doctors who treated her for 
two leg fractures reported the injuries to social workers saying 
they suspected child abuse a judge allowed the girl to return to 
her parents following a hearing 
when narelle was treated for the broken nose and jaw the 
familys lawyer urged mrs jordan to take narelle home rather than 
leave her in the hospital 
shortly after they got home three police cars and two social 
workers arrived seeking to take norelle into protective custody 
but were stopped by the family lawyer 
anna and steven moxham of stamford ny lost custody of their 
daughter dawn for six months this year because of abuse 
allegations the 2yearold girl was returned to the couple in 
june after the diagnosis was confirmed through a tissue test 
now mrs moxhams biggest worry is what will happen if her 
daughter breaks another bone 
am i going to go back to court because she sustained a 
fracture because she fell i cant live like that she said i 
live my life on pins and needles 
an official at the national association of social workers said 
childwelfare workers know little about brittlebone disease and 
other conditions causing symptoms that could signal child abuse 
the goal of these services is to protect the child and the 
system often responds with an initial decision based on that 
protection said joan zlotnik staff director of the 
associations commission on families 
there needs to be information out there so parents arent 
wrongly accused ms zlotnik said in a telephone interview from 
silver spring md it is hard enough for them to deal with the 
disease 
the osteogenesis imperfecta foundation recently mailed 60000 
letters about brittle bone disease to police paramedics emergency 
room doctors and social workers around the country said debbie 
morris the foundations vice president

the common border between iraq and jordan 
is only 80 miles long but the two countries are bound by close 
military and political ties 
jordans king hussein forged a tight alliance with president 
saddam hussein of iraq during baghdads eightyear war with iran 
the two countries have even formed a joint air force training 
squadron 
jordan is a small vulnerable kingdom surrounded by three mighty 
neighbors in addition to iraq israel syria and saudi arabia 
at least half of jordans three million people are palestinians 
even in calmer times hussein performs a constant balancing act to 
keep the allegiance of palestinians who welcome antiisrael moves 
and conservative native jordanians who fear the consequences 
the arrival of us troops in saudi arabia has ignited 
antiamerican demonstrations in jordan and calls by some 
palestinians there for a holy war against the united states 
jordan made no vote in cairo friday when an arab summit decided 
to send troops to protect saudi arabia 
it is not clear if jordan will obey un and arab league 
economic sanctions against iraq 
jordan has said however that it continues to recognize the 
kuwait government in place before the iraqi invasion

far from the persian gulf an oil war is raging 
on the eighth floor of the world trade center 
in skirmishes lasting 5 hours at a time brokers at the new 
york mercantile exchange help set world oil prices by trading 
contracts for future deliveries 
when oil supplies were threatened by iraqs invasion of kuwait 
last week contracts for september delivery of crude jumped 31 
percent from aug 2 the day of the invasion to tuesdays high 
contracts had retreated by thursdays close on the new york 
merc fridays close was 2623 a rise from the two previous days 
but still down from tuesdays high the new york merc is the 
largest of only three futures markets in the world the other two 
are in london and singapore 
its basically news and rumordriven at this point said 
broker albert h helmig jr 
and trading is very physical visitors to the floor are bounced 
around like pinballs by traders and clerks charging down the narrow 
walkways a closer look at the front lines the crude oil pit is 
impossible brokers ring the pit five or six deep jostling for 
position and shouting things like ten sep shorthand for 10 
contracts in september 
deals are struck with trading partners through a refined series 
of hand signals palms out youre selling palms in youre 
buying once the deal is struck the seller flips a card recording

chronic stress during pregnancy can raise the risk 
of preterm birth and lead to reduced birthweight a new study 
suggests 
the effect on birthweight appeared even apart from the impact on 
length of pregnancy said researcher marci lobel of the university 
of california los angeles he reported the study friday at the 
annual meeting of the american psychological association 
the effect of chronic stress on preterm birth is well known but 
a separate effect on birthweight has not been well established 
said dr allan katz vice chairman of the department of obstetrics 
and gynecology at the university of texas medical school in houston 
the new study by itself does not prove the latter idea he 
cautioned in a telephone interview 
the research focused on 130 pregnant women ages 18 to 42 
researchers repeatedly assessed their stress levels through the 
pregnancy starting at earlier than 20 weeks lobel said 
stress was defined as including anxiety feeling overwhelmed and 
being distressed by such events as the death of an emotionally 
close person legal difficulties and being robbed or mugged 
researchers found that the level of a womans stress tended to 
remain about the same through the pregnancy lobel said 
analysis found that stress contributed to preterm birth as much 
as medical risk factors did she said the medical factors included 
such signs as diabetes before pregnancy and bleeding high blood 
pressure drug abuse or smoking during pregnancy 
lobel suggested that stress may exert its effects in two ways 
one is that women under stress may take less good care of 
themselves during pregnancy she said 
the other possibility is that stress can affect levels of bodily 
substances that are implicated in impairing oxygen and blood supply 
to the fetus and in triggering onset of labor she said 
scientists are concerned about preterm births because they lead 
to a high death rate and lowbirthweight survivors run an unusual 
risk of such handicaps as cerebral palsy chronic lung problems 
epilepsy blindness deafness and mental retardation according to 
the march of dimes birth defects foundation

red cross blood services are under a new 
centralized national management designed to correct problems with 
the way blood bank accidents and errors are reported reviewed and 
followed up 
the red cross said friday it is scrapping its current system of 
local control in each of 54 blood services regions which supply 
blood to more than half the hospitals in the united states 
instead each regional program will be run by an officer named 
and paid for by the national headquarters and the officers will 
report to a new senior vice president whose only responsibility 
will be the groups 500 million blood bank program the nations 
largest 
the red cross also announced major expansions at its national 
headquarters the staff responsible for evaluating the local blood 
programs and following up on their accident and error reports will 
double from eight to 16 and the unit that makes sure the red cross 
complies with federal regulations will nearly triple from five 
people to 14 
the changes symbolize a recommitment to our goal of ensuring 
that the american people can count on a blood supply that is safe 
and adequate to meet their needs said red cross chairman george 
f moody 
he said the restructuring arose from searing 
selfexamination as well as months of scrutiny by the news media 
and the food and drug administration 
brad stone an fda spokesman said the agency is encouraged by 
the red cross latest moves particularly the trend to centralize 
operations 
we feel that the steps theyve outlined today are a very 
significant movement toward improving the overall efficacy and 
safety of their system stone said 
he said many of the past deficiencies noted by the fda have 
been in part due to problems with standardized procedures and 
communications between the national office and various centers 
one fda inspector mary carden told a congressional hearing 
last month that the national headquarters sometimes took months to 
review reports of aids cases associated with transfusions of blood 
collected by red cross centers 
carden also said she found that the headquarters staff had 
violated fda regulations at times by failing to file reports on 
cases in which donors tested positive for hepatitis or were at risk 
for contracting the aids virus 
fda notification is required in such cases even if the blood is 
discarded there are also indications that some centers were not 
reporting all of the cases of suspect blood to the national 
headquarters the federal agency said 
moody said a huge backlog of unreviewed accident and error 
reports was behind some of the fda complaints he said the backlog 
is almost cleared up 
stephen richards named friday as executive vice president of 
the red cross acknowledged there have been procedural and 
recordkeeping problems but he added that we have not seen any 
evidence of contaminated blood being transfused into a 
patient as a result of those problems 
moody said the new centralized structure became necessary 
because of the increasing complexity of the blood services business 
in the past few years he cited new tests for hepatitis and the 
aids virus as major factors

the company that runs the fernald ohio 
uranium processing plant for the government lost out on 12 
million because the energy department wasnt happy with its cleanup 
work 
the department threatens to veto 167 million more in bonus 
fees if westinghouse materials co of ohio doesnt get better marks 
on its next sixmonth review 
the bonus money is in addition to the 833334 the contractor is 
paid every six months to run the weapons plant for the government 
in the past bonuses have been virtually automatic but in 
response to criticism from congress and elsewhere the energy 
department has started tying the payments more closely to 
contractor performance 
westinghouses latest evaluation for the halfyear ending march 
31 included some praise for the contractors performance but the 
energy department judged overall performance to be marginal 
wrote joe lagrone manager of the oak ridge tenn office which 
supervises the feed materials production center at fernald 
in a letter to the contractor he said evaluators found 
deficiencies in complying with every major federal environmental 
law including the clean air act toxic substances control act 
superfund law and the primary waste law resource conservation and 
recovery act 
pittsburghbased westinghouse did not appeal the diminished 
bonus of 416667 but did file a twopage response promising the 
company is firmly committed to significantly improve our overall 
rating by demonstrating performance excellence 
westinghouse said it has given about half of the fernald 
environmental compliance workers offsite training and has 
developed a training school to better prepare supervisors and 
professionals at its governmentowned sites to meet the 
challenges of environmental compliance 
workers from six westinghouserun plants will attend that school 
beginning in september the contractor said in a letter dated july 
23 
until a year ago the fernald plant processed uranium for 
nuclear weapons 
production was halted so that workers could focus on cleaning up 
the highly contaminated complex which houses leaking drums of 
mixed waste dating back to the 1950s and massive silos holding some 
of the radioactive remains of the world war iiera manhattan 
project 
another 167 million bonus is on the line with the next review 
covering april 1 through sept 30 energy department spokesman 
steve wyatt said from oak ridge on friday

jerry nickens has seen the changes marion 
barry wrought as mayor of the nations capital for 12 years and 
says it was no surprise that the government couldnt nail barry on 
drug and perjury charges 
tell me something what did all of this prove nickens asked 
friday after a jury convicted barry of a single cocainepossession 
charge and acquitted him of another with a mistrial declared on a 
dozen other counts 
nothing thats what it proved said nickens a black 
16year veteran of the district of columbia fire department 
within hours after the jury ended its deliberations impromptu 
celebrations broke out in largely black areas of the city near the 
mayors house motorists honked their horns and shouted barry 
barry and four more years 
several churches opened for unscheduled services as word spread 
of the outcome of the trial 
jim myers a white resident of suburban prince georges county 
md didnt share the jubilation 
it was a lot of trial and a lot of error he said the 
government should have known that it was never going to get a 
conviction of a black mayor by a predominantly black jury in a 
predominantly black city 
nickens speaking from a different perspective said he joined 
the fire department in 1974 when most of the senior officers and 
commanders were white and only a small percentage of firefighters 
were black 
barry opened doors for people like me a black high school 
dropout to become somebody to get jobs and opportunities that we 
were never to get before nickens said 
im a marion barry man always have been and always will be 
hes done a lot of good things for this city that nobody wants to 
give him credit for you cant take that away from him 
barry and supporters argued that vindictive federal prosecutors 
singled him out and spent millions to prosecute him partly because 
he is black the case exposed deep racial divisions in washington 
twothirds of whose residents are black 
the mayor now knows that he cant trust anybody said 
chantala burton a 21yearold native washingtonian all of his 
socalled friends were so willing to speak against him all i can

men with lower cholesterol are more likely to die 
from accidents suicide or violence according to a report 
published in the british journal of medicine 
university of pittsburgh researchers found a highly 
significant association between lowered cholesterol levels and 
higher death rates from suicide accidents or violence in their 
analyis of six studies 
in the article published friday the authors said the 
association could result from changes in moods or cognitive 
functions such as concentration brought about by alterations in 
lifelong eating or behavioral patterns 
there is some experimental evidence that modifying the fat in 
the diet has both neurochemical and behavioral consequences the 
study said 
the researchers said their findings backup previous studies 
which reported lower cholesterol levels among criminals people 
with violent or aggressive conduct disorders homicidal offenders 
and people with low selfcontrol 
it was not immediately clear whether the findings were also true

the saudi arabian government is agreeing to 
admit a pool of journalists from the united states to cover the 
us military deployment under way in the desert kingdom the 
pentagon says 
we are working to get the pool in there as quickly as 
possible pentagon spokesman pete williams said friday 
williams said the small group of reporters and photographers who 
will travel to saudi arabia will be drawn from among 
washingtonbased journalists whose names had been submitted 
previously to the defense department 
it will be the organizations normally represented on the dod 
pool williams said generally they include representatives from 
the associated press and other news services the television 
networks several newspapers and broadcast outlets 
pentagon officials had been negotiating with saudi ambassador 
prince bandar bin sultan over press coverage of the operation 
codenamed desert shield there was no press coverage of the 
initial deployment and news organizations had been clamoring for 
access 
this is a good step essential said jonathan p wolman 
washington bureau chief for the associated press it simply isnt 
possible to provide adequate coverage of the saudi desert 
deployment without having reporters on the ground with the troops 
the pentagon said members of the pool would leave this weekend 
with its first stop at mcdill air force base in florida before 
leaving for saudi arabia 
it said a separate regional pool of reporters currently in the 
middle east will visit the aircraft carrier uss independence in the 
gulf of oman 
members of the regional pool would visit the aegis cruiser uss 
antietam in the persian gulf on tuesday 
journalists had complained to the pentagon about being excluded 
from covering the deployment of thousands of military forces that 
president bush ordered earlier this week 
burl osborne president of the american society of newspaper 
editors and the president and editor of the dallas morning news 
and jerry friedheim president of the american newspaper publishers 
association were among those who had written williams to protest 
we now have a situation in which an increasing number of 
american troops are deployed in dangerous areas in the middle east 
and the american press is not being given access to the us 
military forces they said on thursday 
williams and defense secretary dick cheney said the saudis 
controlled who went in and out of their country 
the kingdom of saudi arabia controls its borders and decides 
who enters that country and thats not for us to tell the saudis 
who comes in williams said thursday 
saudi arabia is a traditionally conservative society that keeps 
tight control over who enters the country no foreign journalists 
are stationed there permanently although they have received 
temporary visas to cover events 
the pentagon pool arrangement was set up after the us invasion 
of grenada when journalists were kept away from the caribbean 
island entirely 
although there have been several tests of the pentagon media 
pool it didnt work well in the us invasion of panama last 
december instead of being taken to the front lines of battle as 
promised the reporters were kept bottled up away from the action

here are some unusual facts about the 
magellan spacecraft and venus culled from the magellan venus 
explorers guide and other nasa publications 
getting magellan to venus required three main engines and two 
rockets on the shuttle atlantis that carried it into earth orbit 
two rockets on the inertial upperstage booster that hurled it 
toward venus and one braking rocket to slow it down for entry into 
orbit around venus but for 99 percent of magellans 
948millionmile trip to venus it cruised without power 
venus is named for the roman goddess of love its 
continentlike highlands are named after aphrodite the greek love 
goddess and ishtar the baylonian love goddess 
temperatures and pressures on venus are equivalent to 
conditions inside a 900degree fahrenheit selfcleaning oven 3000 
feet below the surface of an ocean on earth 
magellan will collect and send to earth more computerized 
information than the combined total from all previous us missions 
to other planets 
after about a dozen years magellan will lack enough propellant 
to fire its thrusters and maintain its orbit the orbit will decay 
and the spacecraft eventually will plunge into the venusian 
atmosphere and burn up 
when magellan uses its radar to map venus landscape it will 
consume 200 watts of electricity about the same as a bright floor 
lamp 
if magellan flew over earths mount st helens volcano it 
could recognize it as a mountain the radars on soviets venera 15 
and 16 spacecraft which were launched in 1983 wouldnt be able to 
distinguish mount st helens from a meteorite impact crater 
the soviet union named two craters on venus after teacher 
sharon mcauliffe and astronaut judith resnick who were among seven 
crew members killed when challenger exploded after liftoff in 1986 
when magellan fired its braking rocket to start orbiting venus 
on friday the spacecraft experienced a maximum force seven times 
the force of gravity on earth 
during each orbit around venus magellan will travel about 
38314 miles as an average speed of 12163 mph

with magellan safely in orbit around 
venus today exuberant nasa engineers started preparing the 
spacecraft for a mapping mission meant to reveal what forces shaped 
the landscape of the hellishly hot planet 
we think well see lots of rocky surfaces hills and dales and 
volcanoes said bill johnson chief engineer for magellans radar 
imaging system 
geologists hope the 744 million exploration will reveal the 
way the planet works internally the way mountains are built and 
the way volcanoes work said steve saunders chief magellan 
scientist at nasas jet propulsion laboratory the mapping is set 
to start next month 
on friday magellan plunged over the north pole of venus fired 
its braking rocket and dropped into an elliptical orbit that ranges 
from about 171 miles to 5054 miles above the planets surface 
we made it said carolynn young a magellan project team 
member i had goose bumps from head to toe its wonderful 
the spacecraft successfully jettisoned the retrorocket friday 
night laboratory spokesman bob macmillin said 
he said engineers plans for today included monitoring 
magellans performance and collecting precise information on its 
orbit details needed for successful mapping 
magellans arrival at venus broke a string of bad luck for nasa 
hydrogen gas leaks have grounded the shuttle fleet temporarily and 
a mirror focusing flaw severely impaired the 15 billion hubble 
space telescope 
magellan is equipped with radar designed to peer through the 
thick venusian clouds and unveil the landscape of the second planet 
from the sun on sept 1 it will start mapping by bouncing radar 
waves off venus and capturing the echoes 
nasa said the radar should be able to yield pictures and maps of 
about 90 percent of venus at a level of detail 10 times better than 
in images produced by two soviet venera spacecraft that were 
launched in 1983 it should be able to detect features as small as 
about two football fields 
its like going to the grand canyon instead of having someone 
tell you about it mission analyst rob lock said 
magellan project manager tony spear said some worthwhile 
pictures of venus surface may be produced by radar tests that 
start next thursday but it is most likely in september that 
we will get images of sufficient quality 
magellan was launched from the shuttle atlantis on may 4 1989 
starting a roundabout 948millionmile journey to venus it met the 
planet at a distance of 144 million miles from earth 
venus is earths nearest neighbor other than the moon and is 
similar to earth in size mass density and position 
magellan may reveal similarities and differences between the two 
planets including whether any of venus volcanoes are active and 
whether its surface features are formed by largescale movements of 
gigantic plates of rocky crust 
it also will look for signs that the bonedry planet may have 
had oceans before a runaway greenhouse effect raised its 
surface temperature to 900 degrees fahrenheit saunders said 
magellan has no ability to determine what caused global warming on 
venus but may find clues to when it started 
lennard fisk nasas associate administrator for space science 
called magellans arrival at venus the beginning of one of the 
most exciting eras of planetary exploration a period that 
includes upcoming missions to jupiter mars saturn asteroids and 
comets 
magellan was the first us planetary spacecraft launched since 
pioneers 12 and 13 were sent to venus in 1978 and also the first 
launched from a shuttle 
magellan named for 16th century global circumnavigator 
ferdinand magellan is 21 feet long and 15 feet wide after firing 
the heavy fuelfilled braking rocket its 37ton weight dropped to 
less than 15 tons spear said

martin was named to the presidency of the publicly supported 
corporation on thursday by the board of directors 
a private attorney in washington martin was director of the 
office of government ethics from 1983 to 1987 he had previously 
been chief counsel to the secret service and a justice department 
prosecutor specializing in organized crime 
the board met twice in the last two weeks to select a new 
president for the corporation which has become a political 
battleground between liberals and conservatives over its proper 
role in representing indigent clients 
the board also approved a resolution asking congress not to lift 
a longtime ban on the use of federal funds to pursue cases 
involving abortion rights 
state and local legal services chapters that receive public 
money from other sources that is earmarked for that purpose are 
allowed to represent women in abortionrights cases 
legal aid lawyers in california recently won a court case 
overturning a state decision to cut support for planned parenthood 
counseling services which included giving advice to women about 
abortion 
the 320 million legal services authorization bill pending in 
the house judiciary committee contains a provision that lifts a 
longstanding ban on the use of federal funds for abortion cases 
the proposal was contained in a version of the bill passed by a 
subcommittee 
david eisner a spokesman for the legal services corp said the 
new president favors the current restrictions on abortion 
litigation the position pays up to 78200 annually but the board 
has not completed negotiations on a salary with martin

the national geographic society is 
anticipating history by unifying east and west germany and 
decentralizing the soviet union in its new world atlas society 
officials say 
the sixth edition of the national geographic atlas of the world 
removes the red line that separated the two germanys in past 
editions and refers only to the nation of germany 
weve had to look into our crystal ball and see that the 
unification of germany is inevitable john b garver national 
geographics chief cartographer said friday 
the atlas shows both bonn and berlin as capitals but features 
only the west german flag the page on germany was printed at a 
willard ohio publishing house thursday and friday with the new 
edition of 240000 copies to be released in november 
unification is scheduled to take place in december although the 
east german parliament has called for the first allgerman 
elections and the merging of the two germanys on oct 14 
spokeswoman barbara hand fallon said national geographics first 
new atlas since 1981 drops the letters ssr or soviet 
socialist republic from ll soviet states except russia to reflect 
impulses within the soviet union for greater independence 
the capitals of such states as lithuania have been clearly 
marked in the event they later gain independence from moscow she 
said 
other political changes to be reflected in the new book are the 
recent unification of north and south yemen and the de facto 
division of cyprus 
the middle east map will be flagged with a note that on aug 
2 1990 iraqi military forces invaded kuwait 
its a precarious time to be putting out a world atlas miss

a former reagan administration aide who worked 
with john poindexter and oliver north is giving federal grand jury 
testimony before the panel investigating the irancontra affair 
ronald sable an exnational security council staff member 
declined to discuss his testimony as he left the us courthouse on 
friday sable was a witness at poindexters criminal trial in march 
a retired air force colonel sable is now vice president for 
legislative liaison at aircraft manufacturer mcdonnell douglas corp 
sable was the nscs legislative affairs director in 1986 when 
congress renewed its inquiries into reports that north was secretly 
assisting the nicaraguan contras in defiance of a congressional ban 
on us military aid to the rebels 
at poindexters trial sable testified that the national 
security adviser decided to follow the line of poindexters 
predecessor robert mcfarlane mcfarlane in 1985 denied that north 
was raising money or coordinating the contra military effort 
poindexter sent responses to congress endorsing mcfarlanes 
denials which mcfarlane eventually admitted were false shortly 
after poindexters letters were sent north denied in a 
facetoface meeting with the house intelligence committee that he 
had armed the contras 
sable testified that he did not know the denials were false 
mcfarlane pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges that he misled 
congress when he denied norths contra military aid in letters to 
three house committees 
poindexter was convicted of obstruction of congress in

a former top adviser to us attorney 
general dick thornburgh was indicted on charges he used cocaine 
during thornburghs fiveyear rise from pennsylvanias governor to 
the nations top prosecutor 
it was the fourth time since may that longtime thornburgh aides 
have fallen from grace two were reassigned after deception on fbi 
polygraph tests and a third resigned after his security clearance 
was revoked 
former justice department lawyer henry g barr 47 was charged 
friday with one count of cocaine possession two counts of making 
false statements and one count of conspiracy 
the indictment returned by a grand jury in harrisburg accuses 
barr of using cocaine from december 1984 to january 1988 and again 
on april 8 1989 about one month before he resigned his federal 
post and resumed private practice 
barr who lives in a harrisburg suburb first worked with 
thornburgh during the 1970s when thornburgh was a federal 
prosecutor in pittsburgh he became the governors chief counsel in 
1985 and followed thornburgh to the justice department in 1988 
the grand jury said barr conspired with others to obtain 
possess and use cocaine and to conceal his cocaine involvement from 
outside scrutiny 
barr allegedly lied on a federal form that asked if he used or 
provided illegal drugs within the last five years he repeated the 
false statement in a subsequent interview with the fbi the 
indictment said 
if convicted on all counts barr could face a sentence of up to 
12 years in prison and fines of 510000 the falsestatement 
counts are felonies that carry possible fiveyear jail terms 
in a statement issued in washington thornburgh praised barr as 
a capable lawyer who devoted many years of his career to public 
service 
he said he was disqualifying himself from any involvement in 
barrs prosecution 
i have no knowledge of the particular circumstances of this 
case thornburgh said it is now up to a judge and jury to 
determine the facts of this case and their consequences for mr 
barr 
no one answered the telephone at barrs mechanicsburg home 
friday afternoon his lawyer charles f scarlata said in a 
statement that barr would plead innocent 
the ultimate irony here is there is not even a suggestion from 
any source that mr barr performed his duties in other than a 
thoroughly professional honest competent and loyal manner the 
statement said 
several top justice department officials have bowed out of the 
investigation including acting us attorney james west wests 
chief assistant gordon ad zubrod has been assigned to prosecute 
the case 
barr was the first public official charged in a 15monthlong 
federal investigation of cocaine use in the harrisburg area 
his indictment follows personnel troubles thornburgh has faced 
with three other aides who followed him from pennsylvania to 
washington 
in may thornburgh reassigned top aides david runkel and robin 
ross to less sensitive positions after it was disclosed that they 
had showed deception on fbi polygraph tests during an investigation 
of an unauthorized news leak 
last month aide barry stern resigned from the justice 
department when agency officials revoked his temporary security 
clearance 
all three men served under thornburgh when he was governor 
stern was labor and industry secretary runkel was his press 
secretary and ross was a special assistant

families around the nation stayed close to their telephones and 
television sets hoping for clues to the uncertain fates of 
american relatives stranded when saddam husseins iraqi troops 
rolled into kuwait 
im getting hostile im getting frustrated said kevin 
york who last spoke to his pregnant wife faye two weeks ago the 
state department said it could be an hour or it could be four or 
five days i cant just sit and wait 
york a resident of mount prospect ill said his wife and her 
mother were caught while visiting their iraqi homeland for the 
first time in 15 years 
saddams call friday for an arab holy war against all 
enemies of islam only heightened fears among relatives of the 
estimated 3500 americans in iraq and kuwait during the aug 2 
invasion 
it was during the takeovers early hours that the rev edwin 
davis of koran la last heard from his daughter who with her 
husband and children was visiting a relative in kuwait 
they said they were under attack and that helicopters were 
flying overhead davis 68 said in a telephone interview friday 
my daughter told us not to worry that theyd be ok 
but such fleeting assurances are of little solace to relatives 
as saddam digs in his heels and thousands of american troops 
prepare to defend saudi arabia 
they may not be called hostages but in reality they are 
davis said i doubt if theyll be released because hussein is 
kind of a ruthless character and hes going to play it smart 
use them as a shield its his ace in the hole 
still some trapped americans have already broken free of the 
iraqi armys hold trickling over the borders of kuwait or iraq and 
back home to share with relatives their daring tales of escape 
an american basketball coach his wife and their three poodles 
drove through a sandstorm before bolting past iraqi troops they 
had a joyous reunion friday with family members in san antonio 
once we made the decision to leave we started off on the road 
and didnt turn back said jim calvin coach of the kuwaiti 
national basketball team it was 3 hours of solid driving 
through a sandstorm my radiator had a hole and i wasnt sure if 
it was going to make it 
calvin said the blond hair of his wife phyllis made her an 
obvious target in the arab country 
i just ducked as low as i could get and told my wife to get on 
the floorboard but nobody chased us he said the third time 
we stopped two soldiers walked around the car and we bolted they 
gave us the opening and we just took off 
while the calvins embraced family at san antonio international 
airport early friday one of their friends from kuwait was doing 
the same in new mexico 
after learning that a can of diet pepsi had helped steve betts 
35 gain his freedom officials at pepsico inc loaned him their 
corporate jet for the last leg of his escape from kuwait city back 
to santa fe 
the swim coach for kuwaits national team was driving toward the 
saudi border when a thirsty iraqi soldier stopped his car and asked 
for water betts handed over a can of diet cola and the soldier 
waved him on 
relatives of an oregon family also encountered iraqi troops 
while wending their way back to safety 
we saw the whole business the troops the arms the cannons 
the fires everything said kim elzahr who escaped wednesday 
with her husband and two young children 
she said the family survived a 12hour road trip in sizzling 
desert heat and endured a sixhour wait while their passports were 
processed at the saudi border 
among the most worried loved ones was peter nabakov whose 
10yearold daughter penelope was aboard a flight into kuwait 
city that was detained by iraqi forces he refused to speak with 
reporters friday saying he had to stay by the phone and keep the 
line open for official word on the girls whereabouts 
neighbor children in albany calif fretted about their 
playmate despite the good news that she was transferred wednesday 
from a baghdad hotel to the us embassy in the iraqi capital

a rare new york city tornado uprooted trees 
smashed houses and cars and downed power lines while cutting a 
narrow swath through the staten island borough 
there were no reports of injuries in the tornado friday but 
four people were treated for hysteria said emergency medical 
services spokesman robert leonard 
lt jim powell a fire department spokesman said trees torn 
from the ground fell on houses cars and power lines cutting off 
electricity and telephone service and also causing a gas leak 
a few people were emotionally upset with damage done to their 
houses and cars but no one was physically hurt powell said 
the tornado began as a water spout in lower new york bay that 
hit land in the grant citymidland beach area of staten island 
said anthony gigi of the national weather service police termed it 
a minitornado because damage was centered in a three to 
fourblock area 
the hardesthit streets have small cape codstyle houses and 
large sycamore trees planted before world war ii at least a dozen 
trees were torn from their roots 
george platoni who lives near two freemont avenue homes that 
suffered crushed roofs said he looked from a window to see trees 
bending in the wind 
i decided to go out and take a look and just like that they 
were gone fast fast fast fast platoni said 
tom pica a spokesman for new york telephone said about 100 
customers were without phone service because a branch fell on a 
cable service would probably be restored today he said 
about 100 customers lost electrical power but by late friday 
all but 20 had power restored said consolidated edison spokeswoman 
rosalie zuckerman 
bob loftus a spokesman for brooklyn union gas said two gas 
lines were pulled out when trees were uprooted the utility shut 
down service for the whole block to stop leaks he said that about 
50 homes were affected

when a tornado hit the borough of queens causing six injuries and 
negligible damage gigi said no major tornadoes have hit new york

iraqi air force pilots 
acquired a reputation during the eightyear war with iran for 
timidity against real targets and reckless flying near unintended 
ones 
the most notable example of iraqi recklessness in the persian 
gulf war was the attack by an iraqi jet on the us missile frigate 
stark on may 17 1987 in which 37 american sailors were killed 
the french f1 mirage jet fired two exocet missiles at the 
stark triggering fires that nearly sank the vessel iraq later 
apologized for the incident saying the pilot had mistaken the stark 
for an iranian ship 
some us officers said they suspected iraqi president saddam 
hussein was trying to draw the united states into the iraqiran 
war knowing that any tilt would be against iran 
during the conflict the iraqis used their air force to strike 
at irans terminals and tankers in the northern gulf crewmen 
aboard us warships observed some such attacks on radar and 
sometimes with the naked eye 
american officers said the iraqi pilots were skillful but so 
wary of antiaircraft defenses around irans big kharg island oil 
terminal that they often launched their missiles from maximum range 
this the officers said burned most of the missiles fuel and 
effectively reduced their explosive power on impact 
overall iraqs raids were of questionable value iran was able 
to keep its oil flowing from kharg throughout the war which ended 
in ceasefire in august 1988 
on thanksgiving day 1987 captain john luke of the us missile 
cruiser richmond k turner came within what he said was a split 
second of launching missiles at three iraqi mirages that ignored 
warnings to keep clear 
after another close call between a us destroyer and a 
missilefiring iraqi jet in february 1988 the united states sent 
officers to baghdad to work out procedures to protect us ships 
from a repeat of the stark incident 
the only other direct encounter between the us navy and the 
iraqi air force in the gulf was of a different sort 
in september 1987 the helicopter carrier guadalcanal rescued an 
iraqi pilot who had been shot down two days earlier by the iranians 
and was drifting in a rubber raft

an electrician whose faulty work caused 
a house fire in which a 12yearold boy died was sentenced to five 
years in prison 
national trade groups said the case marked the first time an 
electrician was found criminally liable for work that caused a 
fatal fire the judge also called it a unique case 
richard e salz 49 was convicted in june of seconddegree 
manslaughter in the death of burton gorman iii who died of smoke 
inhalation in a 1988 house fire in the neighboring town of east 
haven 
in passing sentence friday superior court judge joseph t 
gormley jr said he found disturbing salzs unwillingness to accept 
any blame for the fire he also ordered salz to serve five years 
probation after his prison term 
defense attorney james ullman said that at most salz was 
guilty of sloppy workmanship he said the verdict would be appealed 
investigators said salzs faulty installation of a heating unit 
in the basement of the home of burton h and louise gorman the 
victims grandparents caused the fire prosecutor michael 
dearington said salz did not simply make a mistake but was guilty 
of flagrant reprehensible egregious work 
the fire was linked to a baseboard heating unit salz had 
installed in the basement 
salz connected the 120volt heating unit to a 240volt circuit 
box causing it to overheat and the wall paneling to ignite he 
also failed to attach a nut that would have tripped the circuit 
breaker when the heater shortcircuited prosecutors said 
salz committed numerous other electrical code violations 
ignored the manufacturerss instructions for installing the heater 
and failed to get a permit for the job they said 
despite the criminal charge against him the state electrical 
work examining board this spring gave salz a journeymans 
electricians license which requires that his work be supervised 
his contractors license which allows an electrician to work 
without supervision was revoked in july 1989 
ullman said salz has been unable to get a job as an electrician 
but has been working as a plumber

a mexican doctor accused in the 
tortureslaying of an undercover us drug agent must be returned 
home because federal agents illegally ordered his kidnapping a 
judge ruled 
the abduction soured diplomatic relations between the united 
states and mexico which accused us officials of encroaching on 
mexican sovereignty and threatened to cut off antidrug cooperation 
dr humberto alvarez machain was brought from guadalajara to los 
angeles in april to face prosecution in the 1985 death of drug 
enforcement administration agent enrique camarena 
us district judge edward rafeedie ruled friday the united 
states violated its extradition treaty with mexico when dea 
operatives kidnapped the doctor from his office at gunpoint 
rafeedie said the court lacked jurisdiction to try alvarez but 
he stayed for one week his order that the doctor be returned when 
assistant us attorney william fahey asked for time to consider an 
appeal 
justice department officials had no immediate comment on the 
ruling 
rafeedie warned the dea that such violations would not be 
tolerated even if they are committed to curb international drug 
trafficking 
the judge said he was not dismissing any charges against 
alvarez but ruled the case could not be tried in the united states 
it was not clear what alvarez fate would be in mexico where he 
currently faces no charges the mexican attorney generals office 
has said it wants to question him about possible crimes 
alvarez was spirited out of mexico by people paid by the dea in 
the united states he faced charges he administered drugs to revive 
camarena for questioning while he was being tortured 
the dea gave the goahead for the abduction rafeedie said 
this command was approved at the highest levels of the dea the 
united states attorney generals office was consulted 
he rejected a government contention that the dea was not 
responsible because its agents did not personally kidnap alvarez 
the united states is responsible for the actions of its paid 
agents the judge said 
alvarez lawyer robert steinberg said he feared the ruling 
would be appealed all the way to the us supreme court my fear 
is theyre going to take these appeals for years while he alvarez 
rots in jail he said 
the justice department said earlier it was pressing its 
investigation into the 1985 torturemurder of camarena and his 
pilot alfredo zavala avelar four men were recently convicted 
three on charges of kidnapping camarena and one on charges of 
killing two american tourists mistaken for dea agents 
three others were convicted in 1988 on charges of involvement in 
the murder more than two dozen people have been convicted in 
mexico 
in another development in the camarena case rafeedie ordered an 
investigation into possible jury tampering during the most recent 
trial 
the action came after defense lawyer martin stolar refused to 
answer rafeedies questions about whether he had social contacts 
with a court stenographer during the trial 
these are factors that create in the courts mind a cause to 
inquire whether there has been any tampering with this jury and 
whether there was an attempt to improperly use a member of the 
court staff rafeedie said 
stolar who represents reputed drug kingpin juan ramon matta 
ballesteros told the judge he had no communications with court 
reporter julie churchill regarding jury deliberations but refused 
to answer further questions about other discussions they may have 
had

ten federal judges brainstormed a plan to 
consolidate tens of thousands of costly lawsuits aimed at the 
makers of cancercausing asbestos a newspaper reported today 
the agreement reached after an unusual private meeting in 
washington dc on friday was designed to speed up compensation 
to more than 100000 asbestos victims and distribute the 
settlements more fairly the new york times reported 
the plan which must withstand likely legal challenges from both 
sides also would boost settlement money by reducing court costs 
and legal fees some judges estimate that twothirds of money that 
could go to asbestos victims is eaten up during lengthy trials the 
report said 
the need for a multicourt cooperative effort to dispose of 
these cases is compelling a fourpage order arising from the 
meeting said the transaction costs are unacceptable thousands 
of claimants die before they can get their cases resolved 
trials have become repetitive with the same issues and the 
same products being litigated time after time 
the compromise plan would separate primary duties between three 
judges whose rulings have conflicted in the past 
judge thomas d lambros of cleveland would be assigned the task 
of trying to settle as many cases as possible judge robert m 
parker of tyler texas would be primary trial judge judge jack b 
weinstein of new york would handle claims against six defendants 
who dont have the money to make payments under existing settlement 
plans 
the order was issued by lambros and parker and approved by the 
other eight judges they are walter j gex iii of biloxi miss 
alan h nevas of westport conn richard a schell of beaumont 
texas charles schwartz jr of new orleans charles p sifton of 
new york charles r wolle of des moines and rya w zobel of boston 
legal scholars said it was the first meeting of its kind in 28 
years 
asbestos is a fireproof insulation material widely used 
throughout the united states until it was learned that too much 
physical contact or inhaling asbestos fibers can cause cancer even 
years after exposure 
lambros and parker would supervise the consolidation of two 
nationwide class actions of at least 11000 cases and more cases 
could be added later the report said 
as of jan 1 there were 29466 cases filed in federal court 
many of those involved multiple plaintiffs and defendants an 
estimated 60000 are in state courts 
a hearing by lambros and parker on the class actions will be 
held sept 14 in cleveland

a judge fined chrysler corp 76 million for 
selling thousands of supposedly new cars to customers who were 
unaware that company employees had already driven them with the 
odometers disconnected 
the criminal fine handed down friday by us district judge john 
nangle is on top of an earlier settlement of 163 million in a 
civil lawsuit 
chrysler had entered a plea of no contest to the criminal 
charges in december 1987 the judge ordered chrysler to pay 
500000 on each of 15 fraud counts and fined the company an 
additional 100000 on a conspiracy count 
over 7 million dollars is a substantial amount of money 
said chrysler spokesman james kenyon the company will decide soon 
whether to appeal he said 
the cars were driven before sale as part of chryslers 
qualityassurance program after the charges were filed in june 
1987 company chairman lee iacocca apologized and said the 
unhooking of odometers would stop 
nangle said the cartesting program had started out as a good 
idea but he said that the program had led to increasing abuses 
and that chrysler had passed up chances in the 1980s to eliminate 
them 
chryslers attorneys had argued that federal law limited the 
fine to a maximum of 1 million government prosecutors had 
suggested chrysler could be fined 120 million 
robert g morvillo a chrysler attorney from new york said the 
company had bent over backward to satisfy the affected 
customers the company still tests cars he said but leaves the 
odometers connected and puts no more than 65 miles on the vehicles 
chrysler has done everything it can to make amends to its 
customers and the general public morvillo said 
chrysler also was charged with selling about 30 previously 
wrecked cars to consumers who thought the cars were factoryfresh 
the us postal inspection service which had brought the 
charges at the end of a fouryear investigation said that chrysler 
has replaced all vehicles identified as having been previously 
wrecked except for cars involved in ongoing court cases 
there are about 46 individual civil lawsuits pending around the 
country kenyon said 
in january nangle ordered chrysler to complete the terms of the 
settlement of the classaction civil lawsuit by paying 500 each to 
more than 27000 people worldwide who had purchased chrysler cars 
with disconnected odometers that had been driven by company 
executives 
the consumers also are entitled to a second payment to be 
determined after nangle decides how much of the remaining 25 
million from the 163 million settlement should go to plaintiffs 
attorneys 
records showed that the automaker disconnected the odometers on 
about 60000 new cars that were driven from one day to five weeks 
by chrysler executives

a moderate earthquake has killed at least 
four people in a village near the capital damaged dozens of small 
adobe homes and sent panicked residents rushing into the streets 
the temblor at 10 pm friday 11 pm edt lasted about 25 
seconds said hugo yepez director of the geodesic institute 
bruce presgrave a spokesman for the national earthquake 
information center of the us geological service in golden colo 
said the prelimimary richter scale reading was 50 
that would make it a moderate earthquake he said 
presgrave said the epicenter was about 40 miles east of quito 
yepez put the epicenter at 14 miles north of the capital near 
pomasqui and calderoon both poor farming villages 
according to quitos radio sucre at least four people died 
including a small child when their house was buried in a landslide 
caused by the earthquake 
one witness juan molineros said an undetermined number of 
people were missing in a nearby quarry 
dozens of adobe homes were damaged and walls collapsed in the 
villages the radio station said 
hundreds of people in the area were sleeping around fires 
outside their homes fearing further temblors the radio said 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 65an earthquake of 5 can cause considerable 
damage

here is the speech by iraqi president 
saddam hussein broadcast friday on baghdad radio and read by a 
spokesman it was monitored in arabic in bahrain and cyprus and 
translated by the associated press 
portions were monitored and translated by the british 
broadcasting corp 
o arabs grandchildren of the men of the first qadissiyah 
yarmuk hittin and nahavand battles in early moslem history dear 
brother strugglers dear honorable fighters wherever you may be 
 
the foreigner used to respect the arab and did not trample them 
under foot nor their sacred shrines and the arabs were in deed and 
in standing one nation 
look at where the arabs are today the foreigner entered our 
homes western imperialism has divided us setting up small states 
to facilitate the task of occupying arab land 
imperialism attended to its interests in oil and secured 
geographic positions on the coasts of seas oceans and gulfs when 
it established these dwarf oil states it made sure they guaranteed 
the major points by creating those states kept away the riches 
from the majority 
there had to be a fundamental correction of this picture 
changing this minority control that is spreading disease in the 
body of the majority and so in the south of iraq iraq responded 
to save kuwait and on the day of the call we responded aug 2 this 
month when iraq responded to the call to save kuwait from the

here are excerpts of the speech by iraqi 
president saddam hussein broadcast friday on baghdad radio and 
read by a spokesman it was monitored in arabic in bahrain and 
cyprus and translated by the associated press 
portions were monitored and translated by the british 
broadcasting corp 
o arabs grandchildren of the men of the first qadissiyah 
yarmuk hittin and nahavand battles in early moslem history dear 
brother strugglers dear honorable fighters wherever you may be 
 
the foreigner used to respect the arab and did not trample them 
under foot nor their sacred shrines and the arabs were in deed and 
in standing one nation 
look at where the arabs are today the foreigner entered our 
homes western imperialism has divided us setting up small states 
to facilitate the task of occupying arab land 
imperialism attended to its interests in oil and secured 
geographic positions on the coasts of seas oceans and gulfs when 
it established these dwarf oil states it made sure they guaranteed 
the major points by creating those states kept away the riches 
from the majority 
there had to be a fundamental correction of this picture 
changing this minority control that is spreading disease in the 
body of the majority and so in the south of iraq iraq responded 
to save kuwait and on the day of the call we responded aug 2 this 
month when iraq responded to the call to save kuwait from the 
scourge of weakness and corruption and the state of isolation 
which kept kuwait away from its kinfolk and origin in dear iraq 
arabs moslems believers in god wherever you are this is your 
day to jump up and defend mecca hostage of the americans o arabs 
o moslems o believers wherever you are this is your day to rise 
and spread quickly in order to defend mecca which is captive to

king hussein is in a quandary over un and 
arab league sanctions against neighboring iraq which invaded and 
annexed tiny oilrich kuwait more than a week ago 
jordan is a small vulnerable kingdom surrounded by mighty 
neighbors israel to the west syria to the north and iraq and 
saudi arabia to the east 
hussein has said jordan supports the un economic blockade of 
baghdad designed to force an iraqi withdrawal from kuwait but on 
friday he did not vote for the arab league resolution to send 
troops to saudi arabia 
instead the king expressed reservations about the measure and 
took no position and although he says he supports the un 
sanctions he has not specifically agreed to apply them 
hussein forged a tight alliance with iraqs president saddam 
hussein during the eightyear iraniraq war a crucial overland 
truck route from the red sea port of aqaba was iraqs weapons 
lifeline 
and the two nations formed a joint air force training squadron 
partly because jordans deteriorating economy could not afford to 
go it alone 
imposing sanctions on iraq would likely cause major problems for 
hussein among his people who appear overwhelmingly on the side of 
saddam 
during demonstrations in support of saddam friday the moslem 
brotherhood jordans most powerful political group made clear it 
would not tolerate economic sanctions against baghdad 
in southern maan demonstrators chanted saddam saddam savior 
of the arab nation and said they would attack the us embassy 
in amman and us interests elsewhere if american forces in saudi 
arabia attack iraq 
moslem religious leaders in jordan have also picked up saddams 
call friday for jihad or holy war against the united states in 
response to washingtons troop deployment in the middle east 
by late friday more than 40000 jordanians had reportedly 
volunteered to join a special unit to fight in iraq if war breaks 
out 
at least half of jordans 3 million people fled palestine during 
arab wars with israel and many welcome any move that threatens 
israel such as saddams warning that he will use chemical weapons 
against the jewish state 
hussein must perform a constant balancing act between 
palestinians and the more conservative native jordanians 
the king was clearly aware of prosaddam public feeling when he 
said wednesday his government was studying the sanctions issue 
asked whether he approved the dispatch of us troops to the 
gulf region hussein said saudi arabia is a sovereign state that 
can accept or seek any kind of assistance that it believes it needs 
it is not for me to say whether this is right or not time 
will tell whether it was or otherwise he said 
hussein did however reject saddams annexation of kuwait and 
said jordan still recognizes the emirate regime in kuwait 
analysts said a mounting antiamerican sentiment among 
jordanians and the prosaddam swing is mainly because of a 
perceived double standard by washington in dealing with the un 
resolutions 
arab critics have said the united states should not intervene to 
protect saudi arabia because it has not moved to end the israeli 
occupation of the west bank and gaza strip which israel seized in 
1967 
but besides pressure from his own people against the imposition 
of sanctions jordans monarch is reportedly under enormous 
pressure from king fahd of saudi arabia to adopt an unequivocal 
antisaddam stance 
a government official said on condition of anonymity that fahd 
has warned hussein saudi aid would be cut if the king did not fall 
into line with other arab states ready to impose sanctions against 
iraq 
jordans economy would collapse without the substantial saudi 
financial aid it currently receives

president ranasinghe premadasa is 
weighing a plan to evacuate 1 million tamil civilians from the line 
of fire before the army launches an assault on the rebelheld 
jaffna peninsula in northern sri lanka 
deputy defense minister ranjan wijeratne told parliament friday 
of a proposal to move civilians to temporary camps south of jaffna 
and then clear the north of these scum who call themselves 
liberators of the tamil people 
the tamil tiger rebels have held a 200man army garrison under 
siege in jaffna since june 11 when they broke a 13monthold 
ceasefire and resumed a sevenyear war for tamil independence 
at least 14000 people have been killed since the tamil war 
began many of them civilians 
military officials said today that eight tigers were killed a 
day earlier in clashes with the army in the eastern and northern 
regions of this indian ocean island one soldier also died in a 
rebel ambush 
the officials said on condition of anonymity that police raided 
a rebel hideout in eastern sri lanka and seized 17000 rounds of 
ammunition and 200 hand grenades among other weapons 
wijeratne did not say when the evacuation might begin or how 
many people would be moved government census figures show 1 
million tamils live on the peninsula but thousands have fled 
across the palk straits to southern india 
the suggestion is before the president we plan to get all 
innocent tamil civilians out of the jaffna peninsula and then throw 
the tamil terrorists into the salty waters of the palk straits 
wijeratne said 
government and military officials said privately it may take 
some time for premadasa to decide on the plan this is no easy 
task said one senior military officer 
the army has been poised to move into the peninsula since late 
last month when it recaptured strategic villages around elephant 
pass which controls the only road across the narrow land link 
between jaffna and mainland sri lanka 
tamils who comprise 18 percent of the population started 
fighting in 1983 for a homeland in the northern and eastern 
provinces where they are a majority 
tamils say they are discriminated against by the majority 
sinhalese who make up 75 percent of the population and control the 
government and army the remaining 7 percent are moslems

ageold american indian tribal customs are 
hampering aids education efforts on reservations nationwide and 
some indians dont even accept the threat of what some call the 
white mans disease 
cultural taboos prevent many indians especially the elderly 
from openly discussing sexuallyrelated problems such as aids 
health workers say 
most indian tribes dont even have a word for the disease women 
at the rocky boys reservation in northcentral montana are trying 
to devise a word in the chippewacree language to convey the 
meaning of acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
the number of aids cases among indians appears small with fewer 
than 200 confirmed cases among americas 15 million indians 
according to the national native american aids prevention center in 
oakland calif 
but some officials worry those numbers are lower than actual 
infection figures because most indians are not tested for aids 
its kind of scary said cecilia limberhand of lame deer a 
tribal health worker on the northern cheyenne reservation in 
southeastern montana the people here think its not going to 
come to us they say thats a white mans disease why should we 
worry about it 
nonindian health workers devising aids awareness programs often 
alienate the people theyre trying to help by using inappropriate 
symbolism or failing to recognize subtle social hierarchies on the 
reservation 
in a poster created for the crow indian reservation a dark 
brooding image of an owl an indian burial platform and gravestones 
embellish an aids warning the images sent a shudder through crow 
tribe member manuela mesteth an indian health service worker who 
screens such materials she knew that in her culture the symbols 
would repel before they had a chance to educate 
those posters and pamphlets the crows would be very much 
afraid of she said they would never read those pamphlets and 
would never look at the owl poster and probably would not hang the 
poster of the raised burial 
tribal taboos also require that any discussion of sexuality be 
conducted through rigidly defined family roles 
we try to do surveys here and find that certain people 
cannot talk to other people said tennyson doney indian health 
service chief on the crow reservation in southeastern montana 
a nephew cannot talk to his uncle about certain things and an 
uncle will not talk to his nephew about certain things doney 
said all your aunts are your mothers women start breaking 
away from their fathers at a certain age and it becomes more of a 
formal relationship 
you try to work in something like sex education in all that 
and it can get very complex as to who does what he said 
even mesteth who is 52 and has been a reservation health worker 
for 29 years is unsure how some relationships could affect 
discussions on topics like aids and would defer to the advice of 
tribal elders 
if i have to give a speech about aids the younger people 
would listen better but if i had a brother there or an uncle 
they might leave the room because id be talking about sexuality 
she said 
despite communication barriers many reservation schools teach 
about aids and other sexually transmitted diseases 
free condoms provided discreetly in some reservation clinics 
and in some schools are credited with recent declines in teenage 
pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases on some reservations 
the health service said 
newspapers and television also help younger indians to gain 
information about aids said verbina savior a health worker on the 
fort peck reservation in northeastern montana but the older 
group says aids is never coming here they just wont accept it 
she said 
tribal laws are often hard for nonindians to recognize 
its nothing that would be apparent said john robinson a 
northern cheyenne who heads the billings american indian council 
thats why a lot of people go on a reservation and say theres no 
culture left they see levis and boom boxes when what theyre 
looking for is breechcloths and feathers 
but the culture is what they cant see

the iraqiamerican standoff is unlikely to 
change an overall downward trend in defense spending but certain 
companies could benefit by arms sales to saudi arabia and other 
countries analysts said 
the confrontation has accelerated prospects for an international 
recession but some opportunities also are unfolding said richard 
rosecrance a political science professor at the university of 
california los angeles 
the net effect is probably going to be inflationary whatever 
the shortterm effect may be said rosecrance associate director 
of the center for international and strategic affairs 
iraqs invasion of kuwait has already cooled congressional ardor 
to make aggressive defense spending reductions 
it probably will mean the defense cuts will be a little bit 
less than they otherwise would be said alexis cain of the 
private defense budget project 
the defense industry is one of the largest components of 
californias 700 billion economy recent drives to cut defense 
spending have yielded thousands of layoffs 
several defense industry executives declined to comment on the 
impact iraqs takeover could have on southern californias 
armaments industry 
my guess is us defense spending will continue to decline 
said lawrence harris a defense industry analyst for bateman 
eichler hill richards a los angeles brokerage firm 
but raytheon general dynamics corp and certain other us 
makers of missiles tanks and war planes could gain new orders from 
foreign countries especially saudi arabia and israel harris said 
friday 
in particular raytheon has discussed sales of its new 
groundtoair missile the patriot with both countries said dave 
harris a spokesman for the army missile command near huntsville 
ala 
with iraqi missiles poised on the saudi border the kingdoms 
interest in acquiring the hightech patriot obviously would 
intensify analysts said 
patriot sales to the saudis probably would require congressional 
approval and as of right now there is no pending sale dave 
harris said 
general dynamics announced last month that the saudis agreed to 
purchase 315 m1 tanks the armys main battle tank for 18 
billion with deliveries scheduled through the mid1990s 
the st louisbased manufacturer also signed a deal in 1988 to 
produce 555 m1 tanks for egypt with deliveries to be completed by 
the year 2002 
general dynamics spokesman george salamon said its much too 
early to say if the crisis might prompt the company to change its 
plans to consolidate two divisions in southern california 
eliminating as many as 2000 jobs 
rosecrance said the crisis by driving up oil prices and fueling 
inflation has accelerated prospects of a recession 
the persian gulf is just the icing on the recessionary cake 
he said

japans longterm energy outlook isnt likely to 
change despite the rise in oil prices because the country has 
slashed oil consumption through conservation and development of 
other energy sources analysts say 
japan announced a week ago it was joining an international 
embargo on oil imported from iraq and kuwait to pressure baghdad to 
withdraw from the oilrich gulf nation it invaded aug 2 oil 
prices shot up after iraqs attack 
the higher prices should have taken a harsh toll on japan which 
imports 998 percent of its oil and depends on it for 57 percent of 
its energy needs according to the ministry of international trade 
and industry 
but since the oil shock of the early 1970s when oil prices 
soared japan has been steadily moving away from oil toward greater 
reliance on nuclear power conservation efforts also have played 
their part in reducing dependence 
while the nation never will be totally independent of imported 
oil government planners say they hope japan eventually will need 
oil for less than half its energy needs 
oil dependence has grown slightly since bottoming out at 563 
percent five years ago but consumption still represents a big 
shift from 1973 when oil supplied 77 percent of japans energy 
coal accounts for 18 percent of japans energy liquid natural 
gas and nuclear energy nearly 10 percent each hydroelectric power 
about 1 percent and other sources just over 1 percent according 
to ministry data 
and since iraqs invasion of kuwait the government has called 
for further conservation measures to reduce japans dependence on 
oil 
the advisory committee for energy which advises the trade and 
industry ministry wants to cut oil dependence by another 10 
percentage points over the next 20 years 
most of that would come from nearly doubling nuclear power 
production in a june report the committee said that would mean 
building 40 new nuclear power plants in addition to the 37 active 
plants and 12 under construction 
the iraqkuwait situation is still only a shortterm problem 
so we arent thinking of changing the longterm plan said a 
ministry official on condition of anonymity but if it became a 
longterm problem our assumptions would change then we would 
think about changing the plan 
in the 1970s conservation helped ease the burden the brilliant 
lights of the ginza a fancy shopping and entertainment district 
dimmed and television stations cut their broadcast hours 
industrial energy conservation was particularly significant for 
the economy said kermit l schoenholtz an economist with salomon 
brothers asia ltd 
relatively speaking japan sharply boosted its energy 
efficiency he said 
a recent salomon report said japan is now the most 
energyefficient of the developed nations the united states uses 
25 times the commercial energy per person japan uses and west 
germany uses 15 times more the report said 
schoenholtz said japans energy efficiency will help the economy 
absorb the higher oil prices with relative ease in the short term 
however energy conservation has lapsed over the last few years 
lulled by lower oil prices and the comforts of affluence according 
to the ministry 
there is a need for a resurgence of conservation an initiative 
that would please environmentalists and power companies as well as 
the government 
the government long ago joined private environmentalists in 
calling for conservation measures to reduce emissions of polluting 
gases such as carbon dioxide blamed in part for global warming 
in addition power companies face an enormous growth in demand 
according to the institute of energy economics for the first time 
since 1983 last years 68 percent growth in energy use surpassed 
the growth in gross national product 
the booming economy and increasing numbers of air conditioned 
offices are largely to blame said tomoyuki takao a planner for 
tokyo electric power co 
the company which produces a third of japans energy is 
scrambling to keep up with record demand which on july 19 peaked 
only 2 percent below the companys current generating capacity 
added generating capacity will help meet demand next year but 
meeting future needs will depend on the companys ability to 
encourage conservation takao said

new president cesar gaviria is about to 
unveil a comprehensive plan to shore up colombias court system so 
drug terrorists can be brought to justice gavrias judicial 
adviser said 
adviser fernando carrillo said on friday the plan includes 
creating special fortress cities where judges investigating 
drug cases could live with their families free of intimidation by 
terrorists 
he told the associated press in an interview that the new system 
would restructure the entire justice department and originate a new 
100member elite corps within the judicial police 
carrillo said a specialized court system would be created 
specifically to try cases involving drug trafficking and terrorism 
gaviria was inaugurated tuesday he has said revamping the 
justice system will be a major priority of his administration 
violence in colombia is largely due to the weakness of our 
justice system gaviria told foreign reporters thursday 
in the past judges refusing to take drug traffickers bribes 
faced being murdered because of the intimidation colombia has 
been unable to keep any major drug kingpin in jail 
the president said at his inauguration that colombia cannot 
keep allowing our judges to be defenseless at the mercy of the 
criminal organizations 
carrillo said a system of faceless judges would be 
established whereby judicial officials investigating drug cases 
could remain anonymous 
he said pools of judges would be created in which various judges 
would try cases together 
in this way criminals could not identify which individual 
judge tried which case carrillo said 
he said the governments new plan envisions upgrading 
evidencegathering technology better security for judges and 
hiring specialized prosecutors 
the new justice minister jaime giraldo told reporters on 
thursday that fortifying the courts would enable accused drug 
criminals to be tried in colombia instead of extraditing them to 
the united states 
he said extradition should be employed only in special cases 
many colombians believe sending citizens to be tried in a 
foreign country is an insult to national pride

an officer in the disbanded kuwaiti army says he 
is helping to organize armed guerrilla units within kuwait to fight 
the iraqi occupation 
he spoke in a telephone interview friday with sky news from 
somewhere on the kuwaiti border with saudi arabia he was 
identified only as a major who had just arrived from kuwait city 
the officer didnt say how many fellow officers had gone 
underground but said many of his military classmates were still in 
kuwait and others who had been abroad joined the resistance 
estimates put the strength of the iraqi army at 1 million 
soldiers the kuwait army now disbanded had 20300 soldiers 
he said that after the invasion on aug 2 the iraqis rounded up 
thousands of kuwaitis seizing whatever they had and 
taking them to basra an iraqi city just north of the kuwaiti 
border 
a day or two after that he said they started taking western 
hostages and they are being used now either to ward off an 
attack on iraqi targets or to be used to blackmail the west 
president bush on friday expressed concern about the 3500 
americans detained in iraq and kuwait as well as the very 
disturbing reports of violence against the citizens of several 
countries but he and other officials in washington have 
carefully avoided calling them hostages 
asked about looting the officer said iraqi occupiers seized 
almost everything of value put it on trucks and took it to 
baghdad 
and there is the unofficial looting conducted by the iraqi 
soldiers themselves holding people at gunpoint and seizing 
whatever they have have in their possession watches jewelry and 
money recently they have been entering homes and doing so

while traveling alone in the persian gulf region made their way 
into jordan today and the first arab troops reportedly landed in 
saudi arabia to deter iraqi aggression 
iraq has detained thousands of us citizens and other 
foreigners who were caught by the lightning invasion of kuwait on 
aug 2 
diplomatic sources said egyptian and moroccan troops arrived 
today at hafr albaten the same northestern saudi base where 
thousands of us troops had already landed they said egypt and 
morocco were each expected to provide at least 5000 troops 
but the arab troops were traveling under the flags of their 
respective countries because only a dozen of the arab leagues 21 
member nations decided to participate in the deployment rather 
than sending a panarab force 
the arab leaders agreed friday to dispatch a defensive force 
after iraqs president saddam hussein refused to end his occupation 
of kuwait and made new threats against western powers protecting 
saudi arabia and arab nations helping them 
tensions were running high in countries bordering iraq 
turkish newspapers reported today that the turkish military 
moved f16 fighter jets and other warplanes to the southeast near 
the border with iraq and the semiofficial anatolia news agency 
said iraq had moved antiaircraft weaponry into place on its side 
of the frontier 
turkeys nato allies promised it protection after ankara imposed 
economic sanctions on iraq including the virtual shutdown of an 
oil pipeline that pumps iraqi oil through turkey 
in iraqs neighbor jordan border officials said the group of 
americans including penelope nabokov of albany calif crossed 
the iraqijordanian frontier after a 660mile overland journey from 
the iraqi capital baghdad

she was taken into custody by iraqi soldiers in kuwait during a 
stopover there at the time of the iraqi invasion last week she was 
later brought to baghdad along with other americans caught in 
kuwait by the invasion 
the americans who crossed into jordan today included 
nonessential us embassy staff and dependents border officials 
said the size of the group was not immediately clear jordanian 
border officials said the group totaled 12 the state department 
said it was 11 including penelope 
the department said the girl was being taken separately to amman 
by a us government employee 
britains foreign office said today that 21 british citizens 
escaped from iraqioccupied kuwait it said they had contacted

americans detained in iraq and kuwait as well as the very 
disturbing reports of violence against the citizens of several 
countries

saudi arabia a day after european powers agreed to bolster the 
us flotilla in the persian gulf 
the multinational force was deployed to protect saudi arabia 
the worlds biggest oil exporter after iraqi forces massed over 
the northern border in kuwait

in the israelioccupied territories hundreds of palestinians 
marched in support of iraq today shouting we are with you 
saddam arab reporters said 
baghdad radio today accused some arab league countries of 
deciding to send troops into saudi arabia because they were more 
interested in doing what the united states asked than finding a 
reconciliation formula 
at their meeting friday in cairo egypt 12 arab leaders decided 
to honor the worldwide un trade embargo on iraq but eight of the 
20 arab league members present did not support the antiiraq moves 
jordans government was among the eight arab league states at 
fridays summit that did not vote for the measures against iraq 
egyptian officials said the plans would be binding only on the 12 
nations that voted yes 
iraqs governmentrun al joumhuriya newspaper quoted by radio 
monte carlo today said saudi arabia takes full responsibility 
for any attack against iraq because it invited foreign forces most 
of them american into its lands 
saddam on friday urged arabs to overthrow the regions oil 
emirs drive us soldiers from saudi arabia and burn the soil 
under their feet 
president bush on friday dismissed his sadddams statements as 
a rather frantic ploy by a leader backed into a corner 
he indicated the united states is ready to impose a naval 
blockade on iraq if it tries to evade an international embargo by 
shipping oil abroad i would advise iraqi ships not to go out 
with oil he said 
an effective blockade could strangle the iraqi economy with its 
heavy dependence on oil exports most or all of which already have 
stopped 
us secretary of state james a baker iii at nato headquarters 
in belgium on friday won new backing from us allies for the 
mideast military operation

warships in or near the gulf 
the western forces were sent to coordinate with a growing us 
navy armada soon expected to impose an economic blockade on iraq 
washington has dozens of warships led by three aircraft carriers 
in the area 
the iraqis say their lightning conquest of kuwait was aimed at 
redressing grievances old and new the kuwaitis recent 
overproduction of oil had deflated world prices and iraqs oil 
revenues they complained iraq also owed kuwait 15 billion of its 
70 billion foreign debt 
baghdad reasserted old territorial claims over kuwait and on 
wednesday annexed the country kuwaits leader sheik jaber 
alahmed alsabah fled to saudi arabia the day of the invasion 
iraqs moves have drawn worldwide condemnation the un 
security council ordered a global economic embargo 
up to 50000 us troops are expected to pour into saudi arabia

for as many as 250000 to be sent eventually depending on whether

kuniko miyajima says she still cannot accept the 
death of her 9yearold son because the full cause of the plane 
crash that killed him five years ago has not been established 
i know i cant get my son back but at least i have to be 
convinced his death was not merely a waste of life she said at 
her home in tokyo the only way to ease my sons soul is to make 
sure another accident with the same cause will not happen 
a japan air lines boeing 747 crashed into a mountain on a 
domestic flight aug 12 1985 killing all but four of 524 people 
aboard 
mrs miyajimas son was traveling alone it was the first time 
she had sent him on a flight by himself 
the families want a criminal trial in order to determine the 
cause of the worst singleplane crash in aviation history but are 
stymied by differences between the us and japanese legal systems 
japan is one of the few countries that allows criminal charges 
of professional negligence in such a case in the united states 
liability usually is determined by a civil court 
in 1988 japanese police said they had found professional 
negligence by two engineers at the boeing co the seattlebased 
airplane manufacturer and two japan air lines maintenance men 
last month japanese prosecutors said they would not conduct a 
criminal investigation citing a lack of evidence 
on sunday the anniversary of the crash the fiveyear statute 
of limitations on professional negligence prosecution expires 
aviation and legal experts criticized the decision to drop the 
case they say prosecutors missed a chance to resolve questions 
about the crash 
japan does not have the kind of system competent to conduct 
adequate probes of airplane accidents unlike the united states 
without making them into a criminal case said kazuyuki azusawa 
a lawyer for the relatives 
the real cause of the jal accident can only be made known to 
the public through criminal court procedures we are afraid the 
prosecutors irresponsible decision has sealed the case 
forever 
less than a month after the crash boeing conceded the direct 
cause was faulty repairs by the companys engineers after a 
previous minor accident 
an investigation by the japanese transport ministry also 
confirmed an improper repair of the rear pressure bulkhead which 
was damaged in 1978 when the plane skidded on its tail while 
landing at the osaka airport 
bulkheads made of thin elastic metal are designed to help 
maintain the air pressure inside the cabin 
metal fatigue made cracks on the bulkhead which ruptured during 
the flight from tokyo to osaka blasting away half the vertical 
fin knocking out the entire hydraulic system and making the plane 
impossible to control according to the transport ministry 
investigation 
the plane careened around mount fuji for 32 minutes and crashed 
into a nearby mountain notes written by passengers describing the 
terror of the last half hour were found at the crash site 
even if the faulty repair was really the cause of the 
accident as they say we still dont know how it happened or who 
did it either azusawa said we also need to look into the 
possibility of inadequate inspection by jal which could not spot 
the crack on the bulkhead as well 
the relatives campaign which appeared to be fading was 
revived last month when it was learned prosecutors had said the 
faulty repair may not have been the only cause 
chief prosecutor yusuke yamaguchi of the maebashi district 
which is handling the case told representatives of the relatives 
that boeing may have acknowledged the inadequate repair only to 
prevent further investigation 
if flaws that caused the jal accident were known to be 
applicable to other airplanes sales of the aircraft with a 
dominant share all over the world would plunge he said 
ryoma kawamura professor emeritus in aviation engineering at 
tokyo university said a mere rupture of the bulkhead should 
not make the entire hydraulic system fail 
i heard boeing has made improvements in the hydraulic system 
of jumbo jets after the accident he said this alone indicates 
that there were some serious defects with jumbo jets and the 
company is aware of it 
in june 1986 boeing directed all jumbo jet operators worldwide 
to strengthen the rear bulkheads and install a safety valve near 
the rear of the hydraulic system where four systems merge into one 
prosecutors said they asked us justice authorities for 
permission to question two boeing employees edward n stanford and 
alan c gardner about the faulty repair 
yamaguchi said the request was refused because japan could not 
grant immunity from criminal prosecution in return for the mens 
cooperation 
i regret our inability to file criminal charges but how can 
we prosecute people in the united states when the american side is 
not cooperating yamaguchi said we dont have the judicial 
power to question them as long as they are in the united states 
some legal experts argue that japan is entitled to full 
jurisdiction because the accident occurred on its territory 
about 90 percent of victims compensation negotiations has been 
settled boeing is paying 825 percent of the total and the airline 
175 percent 
victimss relatives have received an average of 500000 mrs 
miyajima said 
she and other relatives said they will continue pressing for a 
detailed explanation of what caused the accident

the lift capacity of helicopters is reduced as the mercury

because of heat expansion and dustclogged working parts 
large military units and materiel can move quickly over saudi

natural cover leaves them vulnerable to attack especially from the

it might be one reason why saddam hussein didnt keep going 
into saudi arabia said one us military source the farther 
he goes the more his supply lines are exposed and he certainly 
knows that 
he said saddams iraqi forces appear formidable because they are 
close to home and experienced in desert warfare by the recent 
eightyear war with iran

north africa in world war ii he said 
most of the soldiers sent to the danger zone are said to be

airconditioners 
filters are replaced often to screen out dust without impairing 
ventilation navy helicopters sent to the gulf in 1987 to sweep 
mines laid by iran had to be hosed down with fresh water every day 
to prevent salt corrision 
the combination of dust and humidity is especially hard on 
pilots who may find their visibility cut to less than a mile at 
noon on a clear day they run the risk of sudden sandstorms like 
the one that wrecked the us atttept to rescue hostages from iran 
in 1979 
even communications are affected particularly over water and 
coastal areas high humidity causes a freakish effect called 
ducting that blocks radio signals at normal distances but makes 
them audible hundreds of miles away

the united states should press philippine 
president corazon aquinos government to disarm the countrys 
numerous private armies and vigilante groups a private us human 
rights organization said saturday 
asia watch accused both the government and communist new 
peoples army insurgents of severe human rights violations and 
urged international pressure against both sides to halt them 
the aquino government has actively encouraged the spread of 
illegal vigilante groups to battle the insurgents asia watch said 
rejecting arguments that this was justified by the communists 
resort to violence 
all private armies and vigilante groups should be disarmed and 
disbanded and their members prosecuted to the fullest extent of the 
law for any offenses against civilians asia watch asserted in a 
100page report entitled violations of the laws of war by both 
sides 
despite considerable us influence in philippine affairs 
neither the reagan nor the bush administration has been willing 
to put pressure on the aquino government to improve its human 
rights record asia watch said 
administration arguments against such pressure are invalid it 
said adding a forceful denunciation of abuses by both sides 
is necessary 
asia watch sharply criticized what it called privatization of 
the counterinsurgency effort in the philippines 
despite a constitutional ban on private armies the government 
has authorized private companies to fund paramilitary forces 
composed of company employees who have virtually no accountability 
to manila asia watch said vigilantes apparently are allowed to 
take justice into their own hands even targeting suspected 
leftists for execution the organization said 
the communist guerrillas meanwhile engage in summary 
executions asia watch alleged saying that its trials if they 
occur at all fall far short of international standards of 
fairness 
it urged the new peoples army to disband its sparrow units 
urban hit squads that attack soldiers and policemen for weapons 
on the ground that killing police who have no combat duties and 
other strikes endangering civilians violate all rules of war 
asia watch said that shortly after president aquino came to 
power in 1986 she took some steps to protect human rights but 
neglected key actions such as failing to prosecute past abuses by 
members of the military under deposed president ferdinand marcos 
had she done so some of those subsequently involved in the 
six attempted coups detat against her might well have been in 
jail it added 
since neither side can claim the high moral ground in the 
philippine conflict lives can be saved only by getting both to 
uphold their professed commitment to protect human rights asia 
watch said 
asia watch is an affiliate of the helsinki watchhuman rights 
watch group of organizations that monitor basic rights enumerated 
in the 1975 helsinki eastwest conference

oil exports virtually the sole source of 
income for iraq and iraqioccupied kuwait have been stopped by an 
international embargo oil sources said saturday 
the cutoff of iraqi and kuwaiti exports leaves a shortfall in 
the world market of about 4 million barrels a day 
but persian gulf producers are only expected to make up the 
shortfall after large western and japanese stockpiles are allowed 
to run down 
before its invasion of kuwait iraq had been exporting 27 
million barrels of oil a day at current prices worth more than 
20 billion a year through two pipelines across turkey and saudi 
arabia and by ship through the gulf 
the pipeline across turkey was carrying about 15 million 
barrels a day it was effectively shut by a turkish order 
forbidding ships to load iraqi oil at the yumurtalik terminal in 
the eastern mediterranean turkey acted in response to the un 
security council trade embargo against iraq 
the pipeline across saudi arabia was carrying about 800000 
barrels a day to a red sea terminal near yanbu saudi arabia has 
not announced cutting the pipeline 
but no ships are loading oil at the yanbu terminal tankers 
headed up the red sea to load iraqi oil have turned back most 
recently the 357000ton norwegian ship hansa vega on friday 
informed oil sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
saudi arabia is quietly warning shipowners not to load 
the saudis will act without declaring it said one source 
the sanction the sources said would be that countries loading 
iraqi oil would have no further access to oil from saudi arabia 
the worlds largest exporter at 5 million barrels a day 
gulfbased oil executives told the associated press in bahrain 
that there have been no reports of any ships loading iraqi oil at 
the mina albaqr terminal on the gulf iraq had been exporting 
about 300000 barrels a day by sea from its gulf terminal 
the united states which has 10 warships in the gulf would be 
unlikely to allow the passage of any cargo of iraqi crude citing 
the un embargo 
the same gulfbased executives said no kuwaiti oil has been 
shipped since shortly after iraqs invasion of kuwait aug 2 iraq 
annexed kuwait aug 8 
kuwait oil exports were all made through the gulf 
kuwait had been producing more than 2 million barrels a day 
before agreeing at a meeting of the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries in july to keep to a production quota of 15 
million barrels of which more than 13 million would be exported 
a sense of desperation in iraqs situation became evident when 
baghdad sent oil minister issam alchalabi to syria this week to 
try to persuade syria to reopen a pipeline which once carried 
iraqi crude across syria to the mediterranean port of banias 
alchalabis trip was confirmed by syrian sources 
iraq and syria ruled by rival wings of the arab baath socialist 
party have been carrying on a bitter feud for a decade 
the pipeline was cut in 1982 when syria sided with iran in the 
iraniraq war 
but syria give alchalabi no sign it was willing to reopen the 
600000barreladay pipeline 
the only other outlet for iraqi oil would be by land tankers 
along a desert road through jordan but such an export route would 
have only a 100000150000 barreladay capacity and there are no 
assurances that ships would pick up the oil once it reached 
jordans red sea port of aqaba 
the daily sharq alawsat newspaper which is based in london and 
backed by influential saudis quoted oil experts as saying gulf 
producers with excess production capacity will abide by last 
months opec decision to absorb a worldwide oil glut 
absorbing the surplus in supply was one of the principal aims 
of geneva lowering huge stockpiles increases opec chances of 
controlling the market the paper said 
saudi arabia has the capacity to increase its production by 2 
million barrels a day while the united arab emirates can boost its 
production by one million barrels a day 
opec is believed likely to agree to increase production once the 
glut is reduced the increase in production would avoid a sharp 
rise in oil prices that could force consuming nations to explore 
alternative sources of energy

mayor marion barry stands convicted of a 
single cocaine offense after a riveting drug and perjury trial but 
he seems elated and his supporters are jubilant over his acquittal 
on one count and mistrial on a dozen others 
shouts of barry barry and four more years filled the 
summer night friday down the street from the mayors home churches 
opened across the city for unscheduled prayer services as word of 
the trials outcome spread 
the 10week trial featured videotaped evidence that showed barry 
smoking crack cocaine during an fbi sting operation 
defense attorney r kenneth mundy said we feel very lucky 
but a smiling barry did not comment after the verdict he said 
he would make a public appearance later today in the heart of the 
city that three times elected him mayor 
racial factors did not enter the jurys deliberations on charges 
facing barry who is black juror joseph deoudes said today i 
didnt see any signs of racism either way he said we were 
above all that 
deoudes added that the jury systematically considered all 
the charges a number of times before indicating friday to us 
district judge thomas penfield jackson it was deadlocked he said 
jurors had expected jackson to order them to continue deliberating 
and were surprise when the judge declared a mistrial 
the stunning end to barrys trial came friday as the jury 
announced it was unable to reach a verdict on 12 of the 14 charges 
against the mayor they had deliberated for eight days 
barry announced as his trial got under way that he would not 
seek a fourth term this fall but he has told aides recently that 
he would likely run for a city council seat political aides said 
friday the lone conviction actually increases the likelihood of 
barry running 
frankly most of us were expecting worse said one aide who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the 12 deadlocked counts included a cocaine possession charge 
stemming from an fbi sting operation that videotaped barry smoking 
crack cocaine in a hotel room last jan 18 
the mayors lawyers turned the dramatic videotape to their 
advantage saying the mayor was a victim of entrapment who had been 
lured into committing a criminal act by one of his former 
girlfriends exmodel rasheeda moore 
juror johnnie mae hardeman said the vote on the cocaine 
possession charge arising from the sting operation was 66 she 
said most votes the jury took on the other counts were 75 for 
either conviction or acquittal 
barry insisted all along that he had been singled out by 
vindictive federal prosecutors as a black leader he said the 
government spent millions trying to convict him and the case 
created racial tension in the nations capital 
the panel of 10 blacks and two whites had differences over 
tough issues but no anger jury foreman edward eagles said 
after deliberations 
never forget that famous phrase that key phrase in law 
beyond a reasonable doubt eagles said thats a very very 
tough standard to meet 
heckled outside the courthouse as he defended the prosecution of 
the mayor us attorney jay stephens said the jury on the 
conviction had held mr barry accountable for his criminal 
conduct and he must now accept responsibility for that conduct 
stephens said he would review the case before deciding whether 
to seek a retrial jackson scheduled a hearing for sept 17 
under federal guidelines barry faces a sentence ranging from 
probation to a maximum of six months in jail the maximum penalty 
under the law is a year in prison and a 100000 fine 
the conviction stems from courtroom testimony by longtime barry 
friend doris crenshaw she testified that she snorted cocaine with 
the mayor in a hotel room last november 
the jury acquitted barry of another cocaine possession charge 
in which admitted drug dealer lydia pearson testified that she 
delivered crack to the mayor in a city office a city employee 
testified that he not the mayor met with pearson the morning of 
the alleged crack delivery 
barry sat stone faced when the single guilty verdict was 
announced but smiled broadly as the judge declared a mistrial on 
three felony counts of perjury eight counts of cocaine possession 
and a single count of conspiracy 
he turned to attorney mundy clasped his hand and threw his 
other arm around mundys shoulder he then turned and hugged his 
press secretary and a supporter he hugged other backers outside 
the courthouse his wife effi was not at the courthouse 
barry would have faced a nearcertain prison term had he been 
convicted of one of the three felony perjury counts which accused 
the mayor of lying to a grand jury about his alleged involvement in 
drugs with a friend charles lewis 
eagles said the jurors came to grips with the perjury 
charges but simply couldnt come up with a unanimous answer 
barrys lawyer acknowledged the mayor was an occasional user 
of cocaine but contended the government has not proven charges 
concerning use at specific times and places

the largest soviet republic has declared invalid 
contracts signed by the central government to sell natural 
resources including 5 billion in diamonds tass reported saturday 
the declaration approved friday opens a critical battle 
between the national government and the russian republic over the 
divsion of power and resources russia is the largest and richest 
of the 15 soviet republics with 75 percent of the soviet unions 
land and much of its natural resources 
the official soviet news agency said the order invalidates all 
contracts signed without russias approval to sell the republics 
diamonds metals oil gas uranium and manufactured goods the 
republic considers strategic 
most republics are considering ways of gaining control over 
their own resources from the national government but russias 
attempt to halt a 5 billion diamond deal concluded in july would 
be the first concrete step 
under the current command economy all resources and products 
are handed over to the central government at prices set by soviet 
bureaucrats the officials then redistribute everything around the 
country 
russian leaders including republic president boris yeltsin 
believe they cannot make fundamental changes in their economies as 
long as this system continues and they have no control or profit 
from their natural wealth and labor 
tass did not say how the declaration would be enforced or give 
any other details 
the official soviet news agency said the kremlin has continued 
to sell russian resources abroad since the republic proclaimed its 
sovereignty on june 12 often without notifying the russian 
government 
it said the last straw was an exclusive fiveyear deal with the 
de beers company to market the soviet unions diamond output 
the deal which would tie up russias diamond production for the 
next five years is estimated to be worth 5 billion the national 
government was to receive a 1 billion dollar immediate loan as 
part of the deal 
the soviet union is one of the worlds biggest gem diamond 
producers and most of its stones come from the yakutia region of 
northeastern siberia moscow does not disclose the value of its 
diamond output 
tass said the russian parliament only learned about the july 25 
agreement between de beers and glavalmazzoloto the soviet diamond 
and precious metals marketing body through newspaper accounts 
there has been no formal reaction to the russian announcement 
but tass quoted an unnamed official of the ministry of foreign 
economic relations as saying it would harm the soviet economy 
the statements of the russian parliament can lead to 
losing confidence in soviet organizations as trading partners and 
may lead to economic losses tass quoted him as saying 
yeltsin has said he will cooperate with soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev in moving to a market economy but that his first 
priority is to defend russias interests 
russia is also the source of much of the soviet unions oil 
another key hard currency export the soviet union is the worlds 
biggest oil producer and its largest oil region is the sprawling 
tyumen fields of western siberia 
pravda reported saturday that while the kremlin and the 
republics are waging a debate on resource ownership a third party 
is claiming the black gold of the tyumen oil fields 
the presidium of the obscure autonomous region of khanty 
mansiysk which is part of russia claimed ownership of its land 
and resources including the tyumen oil the paper said autonomous 
republics have the power to administer some of their own affairs 
but are subordinate to republican authorities 
pravda quoted opponents of the decision as saying all soviet 
republics and the central government invested billions of rubles in 
developing the north so the regions oil production and minerals 
should belong to the nation

contingents of egyptian and moroccan 
troops began arriving in saudi arabia today diplomatic sources 
said one day after a dozen arab leaders agreed to dispatch a force 
to prevent an iraqi invasion 
the arab troops were landing at hafr albaten the same 
northeastern saudi base where the us rapid deployment force has 
been building up the diplomatic sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said egypt and morocco were each expected to provide at 
least 5000 troops 
the sources said said troops were expected to continue arriving 
for at least several days 
the egyptian and moroccan troops are arriving under the flags of 
their respective countries because not all 21 members of the arab 
league agreed on a panarab force instead 12 countries voted to 
send troops 
the dispatch of the egyptian troops was reported earlier today 
by official egyptian media quoting the presidents office 
egypt has begun sending advance units of the egyptian forces 
that will participate in an arab umbrella to safeguard the 
region cairo radio said 
egyptian president hosni mubarak had said friday the egyptian 
forces would fight if someone launches an aggression he did 
not mention iraq by name but his remarks were clearly aimed at it 
mubarak spoke to reporters after seeing off several arab leaders 
leaving cairo after a fridays oneday arab league summit he 
organized the emergency session to deal with iraqs invasion and 
annexation of kuwait and general belligerence toward its neighbors 
we are on our way to sending some units to some arab 
countries mubarak told reporters when asked about the projected 
force 
the united states has sent troops fighter planes and warships 
to the gulf region while britain and france have sent ships it 
was not immediately known what links the arab troops would have 
with the us ground forces 
leaders of 12 arab states voted friday to send troops to protect 
saudi arabia and other gulf states from iraq and to impose economic 
sanctions to punish the baghdad government 
the arab measures were by far the toughest against iraqs 
president saddam hussein since his forces attacked kuwait aug 2 
and began massing troops along kuwaits border with saudi arabia 
the summit resolution did not name the other gulf states that 
requested arab military help but arab diplomatic sources said they 
believed one was the united arab emirates which iraq has accused 
of depressing oil prices by overproduction 
neither did the resolution say which countries would contribute 
troops to the gulf states arab force under arab league rules the 
resolution is binding on all 12 signatories but such signers as 
djibouti and somalia are too weak militarily to participate 
what was billed friday as a final attempt by arab leaders to 
diplomatically solve iraqs invasion of kuwait ended in a call to 
arms and a vote to join international economic sanctions against 
baghdad 
despite the effort to settle an interarab dispute among arabs 
a shouting match broke out between kuwaiti and iraqi officials 
during which the kuwaiti foreign minister fainted a conference 
source said 
libya the palestine liberation organization and iraq voted 
against the package while algeria and yemen abstained three 
governments jordan sudan and mauritania expressed reservations 
and took no position 
the arab league had 22 members until may when the merger of 
north yemen and south yemen lowered membership to 21 they are 
algeria bahrain djibouti egypt iraq jordan kuwait lebanon 
libya mauritania morocco oman qatar saudi arabia somalia 
sudan syria tunisia the united arab emirates yemen and the 
palestine liberation organization now officially listed as

police contact as saying in his parting words 
east germanys democratic government has accused the former 
hardline communist administration of harboring red army faction 
terrorists

gerna friedrich clutched a 
faded photograph saturday hoping someone would recognize her 
longdead father 
she was one of the hundreds of survivors and relatives who 
gathered to remember the germans some of them nazis who died in 
the sovietrun sachsenhausen camp after world war ii 
during the third reich sachenhausen was a notorious nazi 
concentration camp but after the war it was used as a prison by 
the stalinistera soviet secret police 
the soviets imprisoned tens of thousands of suspected nazi 
criminals or germans opposed to the postwar soviet occupation and 
thousands of the internees died the soviet zone later became east 
germany 
mrs friedrich 70 said her father served in the nazi police 
force during the war the soviets arrested him in 1945 and she 
never saw him again 
we hope somebody here will have seen him she said we are 
trying to find about him from other prisoners 
the death certificate she received in 1949 said her father a 
butcher had died a year earlier in keeping with soviet practice 
the document did not say where and she was never able to find out 
after efforts to locate him through the red cross failed she 
traced an east german man who said he seen her father in 
sachsenhausen 
we looked for him secretly but we never got any 
information said mrs friedrichs son wilfried 
such a search would have been impossible a year ago when 
communist authorities still ruled east germany speaking about the 
soviet crimes of the stalinist era was taboo 
but since the berlin wall crumbled east germans have been 
examining the most brutal period in their postwar history covered 
over for decades by communist propaganda 
an early focus of interest was the former nazi death camp at 
buchenwald 120 miles southwest of berlin like sachsenhausen it 
was used by the soviets as an internment camp 
we never liked the soviets we wanted to leave for the west 
but we didnt make it said gisela ketten 
the soviets accused mrs kettens husband karlheinz an 
engineer who worked on a nazi rocket project of spying when she 
refused to testify against him both were convicted of espionage 
and sent to sachsenhausen 
karlheinz then spent six years in siberia the couple fled to 
west berlin when he returned from frozen wasteland in 1956 
mrs ketten fought back tears as she tried to describe what it 
meant to come back to sachsenhausen for the first time in four 
decades 
i can only thank god we survived and can now honor those who 
were here with us she said 
guenther agde a former inmate came up with the idea of 
erecting a monument to the victims of stalinism at the welltended 
camp 21 miles north of berlin 
there was already a large museum devoted to resistance movements 
against hitler as well as many books and leaflets about the camp 
where about 100000 people died after it was set up in 1936 
but only a small new brochure printed after last falls 
revolution swept the east german communist leaders from power 
mentions the camps history as a soviet prison from 1945 to 1950 
this stone is the first sign of memory agde told a crowd of 
several hundred people including former inmates and their 
families dozens of wreaths were laid at the foot of the granite 
stone monument that pays tribute to the victims of stalinist 
decrees 
karlheinz reuter a former inmate estimated up to 25000 
germans died in the sachsenhausen camp at soviet hands 
when the crowd dispersed after the ceremony mrs friedrich and 
her son remained they hoped there might be latecomers and that 
someone might recognize the face in the photograph

here are some tips from university of rochester 
researchers on how to help a child adjust to a divorce 
children need time to adjust to each family change such as 
moving visitation and remarriage 
once a firm decision is made about separation or divorce tell 
children ahead of time in a way they can understand if possible 
parents should tell their children together 
accept childrens feelings and help them learn to talk about 
their feelings 
make sure children know you love them that you will take care 
of them and that the divorce is not their fault remind them that 
parents divorce each other not their children and that your love 
for them will endure 
let your children continue to be children encourage school 
activities and hobbies that develop their strengths and abilities 
discussing family finances with them or designating them the 
little man or little woman of the house can be a burden 
and so can giving them too many adult responsibilities 
do not criticize the other parent in front of your children 
they benefit from a positive relationship with both parents 
talk with your children about how to make things better or 
more comfortable for them 
set aside 15 minutes each day to spend with each child doing 
things together such as reading a book playing a game or taking a 
walk 
keep arguments with the other parent as far away from children 
as possible do not use your child as a messenger or a weapon to 
get back at the former spouse

president bush today personally 
thanked egyptian president hosni mubarak for the arab leagues 
decision to add arab troops to the multinational effort aimed at 
thwarting iraqs saddam hussein 
the white house also called it encouraging that 11 
americans including 10yearold penelope nabokov were allowed to 
leave iraq earlier today 
our embassy is in contact almost hourly with iraqi officials 
concerning the safety of us citizens white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater said in a statement 
pentagon sources said today in washington meanwhile that 
patriot groundtoair missiles were earmarked for deployment in 
saudi arabia and that us stinger shoulderfired guided missiles 
already had arrived in the kingdom as the united states prepares 
for a possible iraqi invasion 
other antiaircraft missiles to be deployed include the 
chaparral a supersonic mobile heatseeking missile that is capable 
of knocking out aircraft and helicopters at low altitude the 
sources said 
the army was continuing the buildup of us forces in saudi 
arabia the pentagon also said 
speaking on condition of anonymity a pentagon source confirmed 
that elements of the 101st airborne division an air assault unit 
based at fort campbell ky was being sent to join the us 
operation codenamed desert shield 
secretary of state james a baker iii and national security 
adviser brent scowcroft were flying up to maine from washington to 
brief bush at his oceanfront home on the latest developments in the 
persian gulf crisis baker is just back from talks with nato allies 
in brussels and ankara turkey 
bush said friday before arriving here for a 25day vacation that 
saddam husseins call for holy war against americans was a 
frantic ploy by an iraqi despot faced with outright 
condemnation by most of the arab world 
the white house applauded the decision by a divided arab league 
on friday to condemn iraqs invasion of kuwait and clear the way 
for arab states to join the growing multinational force standing 
guard in the saudi arabian desert and persian gulf 
fitzwater said bush called mubarak at 545 am edt to 
congratulate him on the successful outcome of the arab league 
meeting the president praised his constructive role in securing 
passage of the resolution to send arab troops to participate in a 
multinational force 
the president said the arab league action was very favorable 
and gives us significant optimism for the future of the mission 
fitzwater said 
bush also called the emir of bahrain another oilrich gulf 
kingdom and planned also to call the emir of qatar to extend his 
thanks fitzwater said 
fitzwater said the united nations sanctions against iraq are 
being widely implemented and there is no iraqi oil leaving turkey 
or saudi arabia 
he repeated that planning for a blockade is under way should 
it be necessary but stressed that the embargo appears to be 
having a considerable effect 
bush went out boating this morning despite a driving rain 
the white house said the arab league resolution approved by 12 
of the 20 states at a summit in cairo provides a basis for 
individual arab governments to send forces to support saudi 
arabia and other arab states of the gulf 
on friday bush said saddam has been backed into a corner by 
world opinion the iraqi leaders call to drive americans from 
the land of mecca is a rather frantic ploy bush said but it 
will not work 
bush expressed concern about the 3500 americans detained in 
iraq and kuwait as well as the very disturbing reports of 
violence against the citizens of several countries but he 
stopped short of calling the americans hostages 
the state department said diplomatic posts worldwide had been 
urged to take appropriate security precautions out of concern 
that the mideast crisis might lead to terrorist acts against 
americans elsewhere 
before heading to maine bush sent congress two letters 
notifying it of the steps he has taken to respond to the iraqi 
invasion of kuwait it was his way of complying with the war powers 
act despite an administration view that the postvietnam war 
statute is unconstitutional 
bush told congress he did not think hostilities were 
imminent he said us troops spearheaded by units of the 82nd 
airborne division would remain on saudi soil so long as their 
presence is required to contribute to the security of the region 
pentagon sources said that eventually 250000 ground troops 
could be deployed if iraq took aim at the saudi oil fields several 
commercial airlines said they had been asked to help shuttle troops 
to the middle east 
the pentagon said other additional units involved in the buildup 
included f16 fighter planes from shaw air force base sc and 
c130 transports from pope air force base nc the navy hospital 
ships mercy from oakland calif and comfort from baltimore and 
elements of the 24th infantry division mechanized from fort 
stewart ga 
while designed to cripple iraqs already weak economy the 
sanctions were exacting a toll in the united states as well fare 
increases imposed by some commercial airlines because of higher 
fuel costs kicked in friday

this is a time of uncertainty for 
pakistans fledgling democracy a time for benazir bhutto to assess 
the disappointments and missed chances of her 20 months as prime 
minister 
critics say her government created its own problems through 
squandered opportunities political squabbling and official greed 
in december 1988 ms bhutto became the first woman to lead a 
modern moslem country the election victory of her pakistan 
peoples party was called a triumph for democracy after more than a 
decade of military rule 
president ghulam ishad khan dismissed her monday citing rampant 
corruption and nepotism and appointed a caretaker government 
ms bhutto said saturday that her pakistan peoples party planned 
to fight the illegal and unconstitutional dismissal of her 
administration in the supreme court 
we made mistakes but our performance exceeds our mistakes 
she said 
as the selfproclaimed poor peoples sister ms bhutto 
promised a better life for a nation of 110 million people burdened 
by poverty corruption and ethnic violence 
ms bhutto wealthy and educated in the west won the election 
largely on a wave of sympathy for her father prime minister 
zulfikar ali bhutto who was overthrown by gen mohammed zia ulhaq 
in 1977 and executed two years later 
she never had a job before becoming prime minister and her 
inexperience began to show within months of the inauguration 
she could never graduate from being leader of the opposition 
to being the prime minister of pakistan a senior western 
diplomat said compromise was not a word in her vocabulary she 
invariably saw everything in terms of them and us 
her minority government left pakistan much as it was on aug 17 
1988 the day a mysterious plane crash killed zia and opened the 
way to democracy 
at least part of the responsibility for her failure rests with 
opposition groups loyal to zia which used their power to block 
change and vowed from the first day to unseat her 
for her part ms bhutto would not try to make peace with her 
political enemies many of whom she blamed for her fathers death 
her arrogance stubbornness and combativeness only made the 
situation worse 
the former prime minister 37 is widely criticized for poor 
judgment in selecting her cabinet ministers and advisers 
she refused to dismiss her deputy finance minister even after a 
high court said he was guilty of corruption and nepotism even 
supporters were outraged when she appointed a doctor who hosts a 
television show as pakistans ambassador to the united nations 
nowhere was ms bhuttos lack of competence more evident than 
in the choice of people to advise her said khalid hasan a loyal 
supporter of her father with one or two exceptions they were 
men of straw they could neither offer advice nor contribute to the 
work of government 
that her government survived at all is a tribute to ms bhuttos 
personal reputation 
while she fought to save her government the country drifted 
unemployment and inflation rose her government failed to bring 
reform to repeal harsh islamic laws imposed by zia or alter tax 
laws that give wealthy landowners a free ride in pakistan where 
the annual per capita income is 390 
if her conduct is to be attributed to the advice given by her 
cabinet and her army of hangerson even then the responsiblity for 
accepting that advice was and will remain hers hasan said she 
sat behind the table where the buck stopped 
corruption endemic in pakistan continued to flourish ms 
bhuttos husband and fatherinlaw have been accused of profiting 
as intermediaries for people seeking lucrative government contracts 
some ministers and top officials allegedly made fortunes from 
kickbacks or used their positions to obtain loans for themselves or 
friends with little or no collateral 
tens of thousands of jobs in the huge bureacracy went to leaders 
of ms bhuttos political party their relatives and friends 
she called the corruption charges a witch hunt by the 
opposition amazing even those who admired her 
the public and powerful army generals became increasingly 
dissatisfied and ishaq khan warned her repeatedly to clean up her 
government 
when she was dismissed ms bhutto accused the army of 
engineering a constitutional coup 
ms bhutto her husband and members of her government are 
expected to face a judicial inquiry many fear that will delay 
elections and may lead to another military takeover 
ms bhutto told reporters saturday that she would not appear 
before any special tribunal but she said she would present herself 
before a civilian court

they were split down the middle even after 
watching mayor marion barry smoke crack cocaine on videotape 
jurors doubts about the motives and truthfulness of barrys 
chief accusers led to a stunning mistrial on 12 of the 14 charges 
at his drug and perjury trial and the fbis undercover tape of 
barry ingesting the drug wasnt enough to overcome those doubts 
jurors said 
the jury divided 66 on the charge arising from barrys arrest 
jan 18 at the vista intercontinental hotel when the mayor was 
videotaped smoking crack cocaine and on one perjury count 
according to juror johnnie mae hardeman the panel split 75 for 
acquittal on two remaining perjury counts she added 
barry was convicted friday on one misdemeanor drug possession 
count and acquitted on another the jury deadlocked on three felony 
perjury charges one misdemeanor drug conspiracy count and eight 
misdemeanor drug charges 
the jury doubted the credibility of key prosecution witnesses 
charles lewis and rasheeda moore said hardeman a former 
department store supervisor 
lewis a convicted drug dealer testified that he used cocaine 
with barry four times in 1988 
moore had lured barry to the vista hotel room where he was 
videotaped and arrested 
see charles lewis and all them witnesses all of them had 
something to gain and see the government paid them off so thats 
it hardeman said 
hardeman declined to reveal how the panel voted on the 10 other 
charges other jurors said the panel members agreed not to discuss 
individual votes 
some jurors were surprised when us district judge thomas 
penfield jackson declared a mistrial on the remaining 12 charges 
we were really thinking he was going to send us back to the 
hotel for the weekend juror joseph deoudes said saturday 
nobody wanted to stay another weekend i think he saw the 
handwriting i dont think further deliberations would have brought 
out anything 
jury foreman edward p eagles a history teacher at a 
prestigious private school reminded reporters never forget that 
famous phrase that key phrase in law beyond a reasonable doubt 
thats a very very tough standard to meet 
jurors described the deliberations as calm conscientious 
orderly objective and devoid of racial overtones among the panel 
members ten jurors were black two white 
i dont think people were looking at the case in terms of race 
or politics said deoudes 23 i didnt see any signs of racism 
either way we were above all that 
it was not black against white hardeman said it was more 
government against mayor 
juror harridell jones 58 said we had differences of 
opinion but we got along fine and argued points about the 
testimony 
once the jury returned to the hotel each night there was good 
rapport with everyone deoudes said 
eagles told reporters that jurors exchanged phone numbers and 
addresses and he predicted that friendships will remain once you 
all go on to other activities 
the jurors were housed at a hotel in new carrollton md on the 
night of aug 2 when the fbi and drug enforcement administration 
staged a drug sting operation in the parking lot 
deoudes said the jury had an idea what had happened that 
night but they didnt find out until after the trial that the 
suspect was brian tribble who was acquitted in a 1987 drug case in 
connection with the death of university of maryland basketball star 
len bias 
he said some jurors rooms faced the parking lot and they saw men 
with fbi and dea jackets that night in the morning deoudes said 
there were television reporters all around when we left the 
hotel so we knew our location had been compromised 
the jury was moved to a different hotel that day

police and soldiers regained 
control of riottorn areas of port elizabeth saturday but unrest 
flared in a nearby town authorities said 47 people were killed in 
six days of rioting in the area 
heavily armed police and army patrols dispersed protesters in 
scattered violence in uitenhage 15 miles inland from port 
elizabeth according to local news reports the church of a leading 
mixedrace politician was burned in an arson attack friday night 
the reports said 
police officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
security forces had regained control of the region after six days 
of rioting arson and looting in the two cities 
police said the discovery of another body had raised the death 
toll in the unrest that began monday to 47 
hundreds of people were injured in the week of violence and 274 
people were arrested in connection with 136 cases of looting and 
arson 
in pretoria at least 12 people were injured saturday in a blast 
police said was caused by commercial explosives the explosive 
device had been placed in a garbage can outside a fast food outlet 
in a predominantly black shopping area 
eleven blacks and one mixedrace man were injured two of them 
seriously 
the leader of the mixedrace labor party allan hendrickse 
returned saturday to his hometown of uitenhage to find his 
congregational church gutted by fire 
hendrickse the minister of education and culture in the 
mixedrace chamber of parliament said he had no doubt the attack 
had been aimed at him 
the raciallybased tricameral parliament of which hendrickse is 
part was condemned by most blacks and people of mixed race as a 
sellout to apartheid when it was instituted in 1983 
the unrest in the area was apparently sparked by high home 
rentals a lack of proper water supply lack of facilities and 
inadequate schools 
the riots began monday between members of a political group and 
police at a meeting to protest rent increases and educational 
problems 
according to police criminals joined the political protesters

the invasion and annexing of their homeland by 
iraq has kuwaiti students in this country frightened for their 
families confused about the future and worried about surviving 
without money from home 
balqees alsaleh who had just graduated from boston university 
and was about to head home to start a career in advertising said 
she faces an uncertain future after the aug 2 invasion ordered by 
iraqi president saddam hussein 
ever since i was little i heard that sometime saddam is going 
to come and take over and there will be no more kuwait alsaleh 
said 
the primary concern for many kuwaiti students studying in the 
united states is the safety of their loved ones 
im just worried about my family i dont think theyre safe 
my people will suffer said badriah alqaud 28 a kuwaiti whose 
husband studies communications at the university of massachusetts 
in amherst 
you listen to so many people you dont know what to 
believe said omran hayat a 27yearold graduate civil 
engineering student at northeastern university 
hayat was relieved last week to learn his parents sister and 
two brothers had fled kuwait they drove across the border into 
saudi arabia last tuesday 
they were not excited about leaving but they felt it was not 
safe to stay there hayat said 
his parents told him that many kuwaitis hadnt known about the 
predawn invasion and had gone to work as usual after a day of 
house arrest they were allowed to shop he said 
if iraq remains in kuwait despite international pressure and the 
presence of us troops in the persian gulf some kuwaiti students 
here will be cut off from money because of the freeze ordered on 
kuwaiti assets most kuwaiti students study in the us on 
government scholarships according to the institute of 
international education the government that provided the 
scholarships was been ousted after the invasion 
garwood platt vice president for external affairs in 
international banking at bank of boston said kuwaiti students 
cannot draw money or credit on any account based in kuwait

kuwaiti students at boston university 
alsaleh said her parents who were in europe at the time of the 
invasion told her a committee is being organized in europe to 
raise money for refugees from kuwait and students abroad who may 
run short of cash 
i am worried i would have to depend on the relief money she 
said 
but she and the other students are mostly concerned about the 
safety of their families 
in lowell geoffrey gloria and gina lewis said friday they have 
tried unsuccessfully to contact their parents in kuwait since the 
invasion 
the lewis siblings all university of lowell students said the 
kuwaiti embassy told them the phone lines were probably cut 
geoffrey said he last spoke to his mother the day of the 
invasion 
she told us she could hear fighter planes over her building 
and bombs going off he said she was quite worried 
the international education institute a student exchange 
association based in new york said there were 2280 kuwaiti

the 3500 americans stranded in kuwait and 
iraq arent like the american hostages in lebanon some of whom 
have lived in chains and suffered repeated beatings indeed they 
are free to move about within limits and have not been mistreated 
but in other ways there may be ominous parallels with the 
dozens of other us citizens who have fallen prey to 
hostagetakers elsewhere in the middle east over the years 
and anxious relatives in the united states must cope with 
frustration grief and uncertainty 
ten days after the iraqi takeover of kuwait there is a growing 
concern that iraqi president saddam hussein may be intent on using 
the americans on his turf for political advantage much like the 
kidnappers in lebanon there are about 3000 americans in kuwait 
and 580 in iraq 
the administration has carefully avoided describing the 
americans as hostages secretary of state james a baker iii told a 
news conference on friday that since no demand had been made in 
exchange for their freedom we are not calling them hostages 
the white house said saturday that the us embassy in baghdad 
is in almost constant contact with iraqi authorities over the 
americans and ironically if the government called them hostages 
that would preclude negotiations because us policy rules out such 
talks with hostage takers 
but the legalisms are of little comfort to relatives 
they may not be called hostages but in reality they are 
said the rev edwin davis of koran la whose daughter and two 
grandchildren are trapped were just waiting hoping praying 
he has not heard from his daughter since the early hours of the 
takeover the family went to kuwait to visit a relative 
im getting hostile im getting frustrated said kevin york 
of mount prospect ill who last spoke to his pregnant wife faye 
on july 27 she and her mother who requires a high blood pressure 
medication unavailable in iraq were visiting their homeland for 
the first time in 15 years at the time of the invasion 
the americans were mere bystanders when saddams troops invaded 
iraqs small southern neighbor 
initially when queried about the fate of the americans by us 
diplomats iraqi authorities gave contradictory answers but the 
iraqi line seemed to harden last thursday after president bush 
decided to send military forces to saudi arabia 
the iraqis formalized what had been a de facto situation 
telling american envoys and other western diplomats that their 
nationals would not be allowed to leave with the exception of 
diplomats and special cases such as penelope nabokov 10 of 
albany calif she landed in kuwait unaccompanied last week and 
crossed the border into jordan on saturday with 10 us diplomats 
and dependents of american personnel in iraq 
otherwise the airports are closed and the borders sealed for 
westerners arabs and some other nonwesterners including indians 
and south koreans generally have been allowed to depart 
the iraqi action left bush in the uncomfortable position of 
seeming to pursue goals that are mutually contradictory the more 
military force he sends to the region to protect saudi arabia the 
more vulnerable the stranded americans become protecting those 
americans is one of his four stated goals 
in almost all ways the condition of the americans trapped 
inside iraq and kuwait is much different from that of traditional 
hostages 
almost all are free to move about within kuwaiti and iraqi 
borders the exceptions are the 38 americans confined to the hotel 
rashid in baghdad although they are free to talk with us 
consular personnel and have full access to hotel facilities they 
are under armed guard and are forbidden from leaving the grounds 
almost all were oil workers in kuwait until 10 days ago 
while not suffering physical abuse the americans in kuwait and 
iraq are traumatized by uncertainty over what will happen next to 
what lengths is saddam willing to go in using them for political 
advantage saddam knows that some of the weapons used against his 
forces during iraqs war against iran were provided by the united 
states as part of a us bid to free hostages in lebanon

a window of vulnerability that might have 
allowed iraq to attack saudi arabia has been closed with the quick 
deployment of saudi and us troops the saudi ambassador to the 
united states said saturday 
prince bandar bin sultan said in an interview that the 
american buildup operation is going well and in certain areas it 
is ahead of schedule 
the united states is expected to pour as many as 50000 troops 
into saudi arabia to defend the oilrich desert kingdom against a 
possible iraqi invasion contingency plans call for as many as 
250000 troops to be sent eventually depending on whether a grave 
iraqi threat develops 
the troop deployment followed iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
iraq annexed the emirate last wednesday 
bandar said iraq has seven army divisions with 1500 tanks in 
kuwait which lies on the northeastern corner of saudi arabia 
between that nation and iraq but the ambassador added the 
passing of each day means those troops could be more easily stopped 
by the multinational force 
the window of vulnerability is closing very fast he said 
so far the multinational force is comprised primarily of us 
and saudi troops but bandar said egyptian command units arrived 
friday night moroccans will arrive sunday and the syrians will be 
in place soon in addition he said the british will prepare to 
handle air defenses and talks are underway with the french about 
positioning troops in the area 
bandar said an added benefit is the kuwaiti air force which he 
said has been retrieved to saudi arabia 
asked how long the multinational force would need to remain in 
saudi arabia bandar said until we all agree there is no more 
threat to saudi arabia and the iraqis withdraw from kuwait 
he refused to predict how long that would take but said he 
believed sanctions and possibly a blockade could affect iraqi 
president saddam husseins ability to run his country within the 
next 12 weeks 
noting that iraq has serious food shortages and depends on 
imported foodstuffs to feed its citizens bandar said it will 
probably take one month to three months before you get really 
serious results 
bandar said he didnt believe saddam had stocked food or 
prepared for sanctions because the iraqi leader didnt expect the 
swift international retaliation to his conquest of kuwait 
i think he is unpredictable and i think he misjudged grossly 
the position of the international community bandar said of 
saddam 
i am very saddened by what he has done to the arab world he 
said 
but bandar dismissed saddams call for a holy war against 
americans and other foreigners saying the iraqi president had 
always been a secular leader not a religious leader 
the ambassador said the presence american troops on saudi soil 
will have important implications for the cultural and religious 
habits of the nations people a conservative society that has 
worked hard to remain free of foreign influence however he said 
the americans have been asked to respect the countrys laws and 
local customs

iraqi president saddam husseins call for 
an islamic jihad or holy war against saudi arabia and western 
powers appeared saturday to have fallen on deaf ears 
the arab media generally ignored saddams effort to emulate the 
legendary saladin the moslem warrior who waged the last great 
jihad against a western invader saladin fought and defeated the 
crusaders almost 800 years ago 
the strongest evidence that saddams ploy was fizzling was the 
decision by key arab states notably egypt and syria at a friday 
emergency meeting of the arab league to send troops to saudi 
arabia to help protect it against iraqi troops massing on the 
border 
saddam was only supported by the palestine liberation 
organization and libya proiraqi demonstrations were reported in 
libya yemen and the israelioccupied west bank 
many arabs are convinced that the reason for saddams aug 2 
invasion of kuwait were to further his political ambitions to 
become the leader of the arab world and to seize the emirates oil 
fields to bolster his economy 
they scoffed at any suggestion that saddam whose socialist 
government has shown scant religious fervor in the past was 
seeking to further islam by conquering an arab state which observed 
the faith more strictly than his country 
its a struggle for economic interests greed and a desire by 
saddam to impose hegemony said persian gulf merchant nabil 
ibrahim 
involving religion in this is an extremely dangerous risk the 
call for jihad is certainly irrational an act of despair that will 
go unheeded 
the arab troops being despatched to saudi arabia will join a 
major buildup by the united states backed by several of its 
allies to protect the oil fields that are vital to the 
industrialized world 
its a pity that saudi arabia had to turn to nonmoslem powers 
to help defend its holy land said one riyadhbased egyptian 
diplomat who under his embassy rules spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
but it was saddam not fahd who brought the americans to 
saudi arabia he said it would be stupid to say that the 
americans have any designs on islam saddams call for jihad is 
simply empty of any serious implications 
president bush rejected saddams call for jihad as a frantic 
ploy by a despot condemned by most of the arab world 
but saddams call has found support among some arabs 
in yemen thousands of yemenis demonstrated outside the us 
saudi and egyptian embassies in the israelioccupied west bank 
palestinians waving iraqi flags responed to saddams call for a 
jihad and protested the moves to counter saddams annexation of 
kuwait there were reports of a proiraq demonstration in libya 
literally jihad means struggle according to the koran islams 
holy book every moslem is duty bound to struggle to spread his 
faith preferably by peaceful means violence is only to be used as 
a last resort 
islams spectacular expansion throughout the middle east and 
beyond to spain and the borders of china shortly after the religion 
was founded in the 6th century was attributed primarily to moslems 
fanatical willingness to wage a holy war 
theoretically moslems are in a constant state of jihad many 
modern moslem scholars insist that jihad automatically becomes a 
state of war only when the faith is threatened which none see as 
the case now 
saddams attempt to rally moslems against the united states is 
not without irony 
according to the koran christians and jews are accorded special 
treatment known as scriptuaries because they believe in god 
but not islams prophet mohammed they have the choice of 
converting to islam retaining their faith but paying a tax or 
being fought like other infidels 
a call for a universal jihad earlier this century was a total 
failure in 1914 sultan mohammed rashad of turkey decreed a holy 
war against the west apparently at the instigation of his german 
allies 
but the millions of arabs ruled by the turks in the ottoman 
empire ignored that appeal and two years later during world war i 
they rose in revolt against the turks 
saladins jihad in 1186 against the crusaders who had wrested 
control of jerusalem from the moslems 90 years before remains the 
most successful such holy war 
saladin a kurd crossed the jordan river to recapture jerusalem 
in 1187

iraq warned its people saturday that 
anyone caught buying or selling food on the black market will be 
executed indicating it is preparing for the economic sanctions 
imposed after the invasion of kuwait 
president saddam hussein and his ruling revolution command 
council met and said that any manipulation of food supplies for 
trading purposes will be considered a crime and a sabotage act 
infringing national security 
the perpetrators will receive the death penalty and all their 
assets in cash or property will be confiscated the council 
said in a statement carried by baghdad radio and monitored in 
cyprus 
the radio said the decision was taken to thwart the economic 
blockade with gods help to provide enough foodstuffs to all 
citizens and foil the cheats and the greedy ones 
the warning indicated saddam is preparing his people for 
possible hardships caused by the uns mandatory ban on food 
supplies to iraq to punish baghdad for invading kuwait on aug 2 
and later annexing it 
so far it is not clear whether one of iraqs neighbors jordan 
will comply with the ban a possible loophole in the sanctions 
resolution allows imports for humanitarian purposes 
iraq imports 2 billion worth of food a year and food was 
already rationed in iraq before the invasion 
basic supplies such as rice sugar and cooking oil are purchased 
at governmentrun stores and lines stretch the length of city 
blocks 
the staterun radio reported demonstrations as the enraged 
baghdad masses mobbed the saudi arabian and egyptian embassies to 
denounce them for helping bring us and zionist troops into 
saudi arabia 
earlier the radio claimed that israeli troops and planes were 
in saudi arabia israel has denied similar iraqi claims in the past 
the radio said the protesters chanted death to the enemies of 
iraq and the arab nation the inheritors of colonialist doctrine 
and protectors of zionism who are protecting their thrones with the 
bayonets of foreign troops 
arriving in baghdad from cairo deputy prime minister taha 
yassin ramadan said his delegation told arab leaders at an 
emergency summit there on friday that iraq did not fear foreign 
threats 
ramadan said his countrys strike capabilities could shake and 
burn any spot from which aggression was launched the iraqi news 
agency reported 
the arab leaders decided to send an arab force to saudi arabia 
to defend it from possible attack by iraq which has massed 
thousands of soldiers on kuwaits border with saudi arabia 
twelve of the 21 members of the arab league voted to send troops 
ramadan said the conference was biased against iraq from the 
beginning and its resolutions were decided in advance the news 
agency said he said the summit had been prepared to give the 
green light to the imperialist and zionist forces to launch 
aggression against iraq and the arab nation 
baghdad radio said league members who voted to send troops into 
saudi arabia were more interested in doing what the united states 
asked than finding a reconciliation formula 
the emirs of oil and their servant egyptian president hosni 
mubarak insisted on what america demanded of them said a radio 
commentary also monitored in cyprus 
on friday saddam urged the people of egypt and the persian gulf 
states to revolt against their governments and join iraq in a holy 
war against the west and its allies in the region 
iraqs ruling arab baath socialist party was formed on secular 
lines but saddam began paying more attention to islam because of 
attacks on his beliefs by the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini of 
iran during the 198088 persian gulf war a conflict that 
established the reputation of iraqs formidable army

children whose parents are going through a divorce 
are learning to cope through a program that includes puppets a 
board game and a mock television show that lets the kids play 
divorce experts researchers say 
the program works for children in kindergarten through sixth 
grade using different teaching activities for different ages said 
joanne pedrocarroll 
divorce need not result in inevitable longterm trauma for 
children said pedrocarroll director of the program at the 
university of rochester in new york 
studies with some 400 children of divorce show improvement in a 
variety of areas including solving daytoday problems 
communicating with relatives coping with family changes getting 
along with schoolmates and completing schoolwork researchers said 
the children said they were less anxious less likely to blame 
themselves for the divorce and less worried about family 
circumstances researchers said 
pedrocarroll and colleague linda alpertgillis both clinical 
psychologists spoke in interviews before describing the program 
saturday at the annual meeting of the american psychological 
association 
the program is the best stuff out there for working directly 
with children of divorce commented arizona state university 
researcher irwin sandler 
a complementary approach that involves parents who have custody 
of a child is also showing success he said 
the rochester program is carried out in school over 12 to 16 
weeks with four or five children to a group in kindgergarten 
through third grade and five to eight for fourth through 
sixthgraders 
one major goal is to teach problemsolving skills older 
children describe problems in their lives discuss solutions and 
try them out in impromptu skits in which they may play themselves 
then a parent after trying out a solution they report back on 
results 
in this way pedrocarroll said one boy was able to persuade 
his mother to let him spend fathers day weekend with his father 
it gave him a sense of control she said 
children also are taught to identify and avoid focusing on 
problems they cannot solve she said 
worrying about whats happening in court between mom and dad 
or the support payments those are very adult issues that 
distract a child from schoolwork and the normal activities of being 
a child pedrocarroll said 
using a board game that involves throwing dice moving a marker 
and picking up a card that presents a problem children discuss 
what issues they can and cannot solve 
the program also aims to teach children to identify and express 
their feelings lacking an adults thinking and language skills a 
child may convert unexpressed feelings into headaches or stomach 
aches pedrocarroll said 
even kindergartners can be taught to ask a parent for more time 
together rather than whining or clinging she said 
puppets that act out a childs feelings let younger children 
more easily discuss their own experiences at home she said 
older children review lessons of the program by taking turns as 
divorce experts on a mock television show in which they answer 
questions posed by group leaders 
you can see how that could really empower kids with a sense of 
efficacy and competence said arizona states sandler 
on an emotional level the program is designed to help children 
feel good about themselves and their families it stresses that 
all families dont have to have two parents living together 
said alpertgillis families are people who love you and each 
family is unique and special 
the groups provide a place for children to find out theyre 
not alone theyre not the only ones who have the feelings theyve 
been struggling with pedrocarroll said

prosecutors poohpoohed a poll showing 
its impossible to find an unbiased jury to hear the case against a 
reputed cult leader charged with killing a family of five 
jeffrey lundgren 40 a defrocked lay minister is charged with 
five counts of aggravated murder and five counts of kidnapping in 
connection with the deaths of two followers dennis and cheryl 
avery and their three daughters he could face the death penalty 
the trial is due to start monday with questioning of prospective 
jurors 
the averys bodies were found buried in january on a farm in 
kirtland about 30 miles east of cleveland prosecutors contend the 
averys were led one by one into a barn on april 17 1989 bound and 
blindfolded with duct tape then shot to death and buried in a 
common grave under the barn 
lundgrens wife alice was convicted aug 1 on 15 counts of 
kidnapping and complicity and conspiracy to commit aggravated 
murder five other cult members have pleaded guilty to reduced 
charges and may be called to testify against lundgren 
defense attorney paul laplante had sought a change of venue for 
lundgrens trial citing among other things the results of a 
telephone survey conducted by jack arbuthnot a psychology 
professor at ohio university in athens asking people whether they 
have heard of lundgren and his purported cult 
i have conducted a telephone survey which indicates there is 
no potential juror in lake county who doesnt know something about 
the case laplante said 
he said 201 people were called and only one person claimed not 
to know something about it and i question that the survey also 
indicated that 70 percent of the respondents wanted lundgren put to 
death 
but prosecutor steven latourette said an impartial jury can be 
found although it could take more than a week 
in an affidavit filed by prosecutors friday ohio state 
university psychologist jon a krosnick dismissed the defense 
survey as biased and unprofessional 
laplante agreed the survey may be flawed but said that did not 
change the fact there has been enormous publicity about the case 
lundgren is a defrocked lay minister of the reorganized church 
of jesus christ of latter day saints the church based in 
independence mo is separate from the salt lake citybased church 
of jesus christ of latterday saints although both draw from the 
book of mormon 
after lundgren came to kirtland from independence in 1984 he 
began teaching sunday school and giving tours of the churchs 
historic temple there others joined lundgren in ohio 
the rev dale luffman pastor of kirtlands reorganized church 
said lundgren became critical of the churchs leaders especially 
after the reorganized church approved ordaining female ministers 
luffman said lundgren began seeing himself as a prophet and 
recruiting followers the church defrocked him in 1988 and he and 
his 12 members including his wife and their 19yearold son 
damon lived and worshiped at the farm damon lundgren faces the 
same charges as his father 
dennis avery 49 cheryl avery 42 and daughters trina 15 
rebecca 13 and karen 7 also were members of the group but not 
as fervent as the others authorities have said they did not live 
on the farm but in nearby madison township 
shortly after the arrests kirtland police chief dennis 
yarborough said there was speculation the averys had been killed as 
a soulcleansing sacrifice before the group headed to west 
virginia to find god

up to half of roman catholic priests in the united 
states do not uphold their vows of celibacy according to estimates 
from a 25year study by a former catholic priest who is now a 
psychotherapist 
a w richard sipe told a forum at the american psychological 
association meeting saturday that his study indicated 20 percent of 
priests have a clear pattern of heterosexual behavior 10 
percent to 13 percent are homosexually active and 6 percent are 
involved sexually with minors 
the study carried out between 1960 and 1985 is not a random 
scientific survey but involved extrapolations from interviews with 
about 1500 people onethird were priests who were undergoing 
psychotherapy a third were priests who shared their stories in 
workshops or informal settings and a third were lovers or others 
with firsthand knowledge of priests sexual behavior 
the rev kenneth doyle a spokesman for the national conference 
of catholic bishops criticized the study for not gathering data 
from a random sample he said the study relied heavily on priests 
who sought counseling for sexual problems 
dean hoge a sociology professor at the catholic university of 
america said estimates are all that is available on the subject 
a topic like this is impossible to measure with any precision 
because it is so confidential hoge said nobody will know the 
facts its too sensitive 
sipe is a lecturer in the psychiatry department of the johns 
hopkins university medical school in baltimore and conducts a 
private familytherapy practice he left the priesthood in 1970 to 
get married 
he said his estimates are the best numbers available on the 
sexual activity of priests 
the point is whether its scientific or not you can validate 
a lot from experience he said in an interview saturday 
the findings will be detailed in a book a secret world 
sexuality and the search for celibacy being published next month 
by brunnermazel of new york city 
while half of priests generally support the idea of celibacy 
only 2 percent fully achieve it sipe said about 6 percent to 8 
percent of priests adhere to celibacy despite past reversals 
about 40 percent are practicing it sufficently well enough to 
be called celibate sipe said they have the possibility of 
future celibate consolidation yet at the same time unresolved 
personal and spiritual issues make their practice tenuous enough to 
allow for noncelibate exploration 
up to 23 percent of catholic priests have a homosexual 
orientation sipe estimated and half of that group are sexually 
active he also said at any one time 20 percent of priests are 
involved in a noncelibate relationship with a woman or have a 
clear pattern of heterosexual behavior 
an additional 6 percent to 8 percent of priests who are 
heterosexual experiment with noncelibacy and 6 percent are 
involved sexually with minors he said 
five percent of priests were described as involved in 
problematic sexual activity such as pornography and 
compulsive masturbation and 1 percent in transvestism or 
crossdressing sipe said 
sipe said that clerical celibacy has been shrouded in secrecy 
in all sexual matters the whole muscle tone of roman catholic 
moral authority has been enfeebled by the avoidance of legitimate 
discussion and controversy and by the authoritarian reliance on 
pronouncement rather than on reason he said 
the rev tom oconnor of the institute of religious research at 
loyola college in baltimore said it is hard to guess how many 
priests break their vows of celibacy but theres certainly a lot 
of problems around sexuality 
once the sensational aspects of the study are put in 
perspective hoge said a little more open discussion of this i 
think would serve everyone well 
there were 53222 priests in the united states in 1988 
according to the official catholic directory

four months ago 22yearold pamela smart 
was a popular teacher who seemed to have a grand future with her 
husband of less than a year now she sits alone in a prison cell 
accused of talking a 16yearold student at her school into 
shooting her husband to death 
gregory smart 24 was found dead in the couples derry 
apartment a single bullet in his head on may 1 just six days 
before their first wedding anniversary 
i think about what our dreams were and those will never 
happen mrs smart said days after the murder but im still 
alive and i still have dreams i will try to go forward and do 
those things 
on aug 1 though she was arrested and charged her with 
plotting her husbands murder she is being held at the state 
prison for women in goffstown awaiting a bail hearing monday 
if convicted on the accomplicetomurder charge mrs smart will 
face life in jail without parole 
a police affidavit alleges that mrs smart was in love with 
someone else and wished to have an affair with him but did not 
want to do so until after gregorys death so police say she 
instructed a 16yearold seabrook boy identified by authorities as 
a winnacunnet regional high school student named william f to 
kill her husband 
william f was one of three seabrook teens arrested in june on 
juvenile charges related to the killing because of their ages few 
details of their cases have been released including how the other 
two boys allegedly got involved in the plot 
but william is alleged to be one who pulled the trigger while a 
second youth held smart down a third is alleged to have driven the 
getaway car prosecutors say they will try to have all three tried 
as adults on charges of murder and accomplice to firstdegree 
murder 
mrs smart knew the boys as a teacher of video and media for the 
winnacunnet regional school district 
the night of the murder mrs smart had to work late at a school 
board meeting finding her husbands body when she returned home 
when police arrived they found the apartment had been ransacked 
and the couples dog locked in the basement 
but the next day derry police capt loring jackson said he 
doubted the crime was a random attack or a bungled burglary 
mrs smart insisted her husband must have surprised a burglar 
she went on television soon afterward to ask for help in finding 
the culprit 
after the teenagers were arrested mrs smart was angered by 
speculation that because she knew the boys she must somehow be 
involved 
she acknowledged that she had gone to the home of one of the 
arrested boys on several occasions to work on a school video and 
that she had invited him to her house once but she denied any 
connection to the murder 
people are treating me like im the big link between the kids 
and gregs murder she said but what about the thousands of 
other videos i did for the kids in the school system thats my job 
why doesnt anyone treat me like the victim 
mrs smarts relatives and friends have mostly rallied around 
her insisting on her innocence and describing her as a loving wife 
you have to understand they dated for three years before they 
got married said john wojas jr mrs smarts younger brother 
greg was smart enough to know who he was marrying 
judith smart gregorys mother said that although the couples 
marriage appeared problemfree she now has doubts 
looking back some things just didnt seem right she said 
its starting to sink in that yes she probably is involved 
it hurts because i know how much greg loved her and he 
wouldnt believe whats happening now

leoluca orlando known as the 
antimafia mayor for his crusade against sicilian organized 
crime resigned on saturday after political squabbling among his 
supporters 
orlando came to international fame in 1986 when 400 defendants 
were brought to trial in palermo in the largest antimafia trial 
ever held 
among his innovations were his insistence that all holders of 
city public works contracts be screened to make sure they had no 
ties to the mafia and that the contracts go to public bids to avoid 
corruption 
orlando a christian democrat was elected by the city council

a leftist moslem militia leader said 
saturday he expected swiss hostage elio erriquez to be freed 
shortly 
erriquez 24 was kidnapped oct 6 in front of an international 
red cross artificial limbs center in sidon along with coworker 
emanuel christen 33 christen was freed wednesday 
mustafa saad head of the sunni moslem nasserite militia that 
has governed sidon since the 1975 outbreak of lebanons civil war 
told reporters in sidon i believe erriquez will be released 
soon 
he declined to elaborate or to specify when the release might 
be 
saad was instrumental in negotiating previous releases of 
hostages connected to humanitarian organizations in sidon a port 
city 25 miles south of beirut 
the terse statement came four days after a group calling itself 
the palestinian revolutionary squads handed christen over to syria 
the group had said in a statement released tuesday that it would 
free both christian and erriquez within 24 hours but only christen 
was set free on wednesday 
the release of christen who flew home from the syrian capital 
of damascus on thursday left 15 westerners held hostage in lebanon 
in addition to erriquez they are six americans four britons 
two west germans an irishman and an italian 
most are believed held by extremist factions under the umbrella 
of the shiite moslem fundamentalist hezbollah or party of god 
irans main ally in lebanon 
the longest held is terry anderson 42 chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press he was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
meanwhile a previously unknown group calling itself the eagles 
of the tempest threatened to retaliate saturday for any western 
military action against iraq 
we warn all those who let themselves be seduced into thinking 
of a military action against iraq that they have citizens 
interests and hostages in lebanon said the statement which was 
delivered to western news agencies in beirut 
we shall not let the whole world rest as long as our nation is 
in danger the statement added our nation is believed to be 
a reference to the arab people 
the name used by the group suggests it belongs to the syrian 
social nationalist party a leftist lebanese group that advocates 
the merger of lebanon syria jordan iraq kuwait preisrael 
palestine and cyprus into a greater syria 
the group supports iraqi president saddam husseins invasion and 
annexation of kuwait even though they are prosyrian 
syria maintains 40000 troops in lebanon and is the main power 
broker in that country syria has strongly condemned the iraqi 
invasion of kuwait

geologists may get a glimpse of what 
earths surface was like a few billion years ago when the magellan 
spacecrafts radar pierces the clouds of venus to reveal secrets of 
an alien terrain 
venus is the last of the inner planets we are exploring in 
detail and probably is the most important from the point of view 
of understanding the earth said jim head a member of nasas 
magellan science team and a geology professor at brown university 
in providence ri 
magellan fired its braking rocket and slipped into orbit around 
venus on friday after a 15month 948millionmile voyage from 
earth 
engineers at nasas jet propulsion laboratory monitored the 
spacecrafts health saturday so it will be ready by sept 1 to use 
its radar to peer through thick venusian clouds and make the most 
detailed pictures and maps yet of the planets landscape 
magellan entered orbit so smoothly that it used very little 
thruster fuel to point it properly while the rocket fired so 
magellan weighs more and moves faster than expected making the low 
point in its orbit 183 miles above venus instead of 171 miles as 
planned said navigation chief john mcnamee 
the orbit is so good that an adjustment maneuver planned for 
aug 28 will not be needed magellan project manager tony spear 
said saturday 
magellan is designed to study the geology and geography of 
venus heated to 900 degrees fahrenheit by a greenhouse effect 
gone berserk 
venus high temperature and crushing atmospheric pressure might 
make rock in the planets crust much thinner and more flexible than 
earths head said 
so venus may resemble earth before our home planets crust 
cooled off and broke into colossal plates those plates now drift 
across the face of the earth moving whole continents and colliding 
to uplift mountain ranges and trigger volcanic eruptions and 
earthquakes 
most of earths original surface was destroyed long ago by 
erosion and plate movements so we have grave difficulty 
answering fundamental questions about the early history of the 
earth head said 
while venus is hot dry and lifeless it is very similar in 
size and density and also is the closest planet to the earth he 
said that means it probably had the most similar conditions when 
the planets formed 46 billion years ago so if we want to study 
another planet to learn something about the early earth venus is a 
good candidate 
learning how venus crust moves and is deformed will tell us a 
lot more about the earth said steve saunders nasas chief 
scientist for magellan 
magellan may settle debate over competing theories that seek to 
explain the creation of venus continentlike highlands which 
include africasized aphrodite terra australiasized ishtar terra 
and hawaiilike beta regio 
saunders believes hot spots of rising molten rock created 
the highlands just as hot spots created hawaii on earth 
if you could look at a timelapse movie over billions of 
years it might look like a big pot of thick porridge simmering 
saunders said adding venus crust may feature a bunch of big 
hawaiis all over the place 
some other scientists think venus highlands are big pieces of 
crust that solidified first as the planets initial molten surface 
cooled off 
but head believes plate movements formed the highlands 
aphrodite terra resembles earths midocean ridges the undersea 
mountain ranges where molten rock emerges to add new material to 
the drifting plates of crust 
ishtar terra has many of the features that you would expect 
where blocks of crust are colliding including volcanoes such as 
those along the pacific coasts of alaska and south america and 
folded mountain belts such as earths himalayas which were created 
because india is smashing into asia 
even if the venusian crust hasnt yet broken into plates we 
probably will find faults like the san andreas in california a 
pretty sure sign that venusquakes shake the second planet from 
the sun saunders said

women afflicted by headaches and tension 
at the office should not automatically blame the boss the source 
of the irritation may be a highfrequency barely audible squeal 
from their computers 
two researchers believe they have linked noise made by video 
display terminals with stress symptoms in women who hear 
highfrequency sounds better than men 
the sound is present in almost all american computers said 
dr caroline dow assistant professor of communication at the 
university of evansville we can all work through that sound but 
it is tiring and distracting 
the sound might be compared to the cry of a rabbit caught in a 
trap said dows husband dr douglas covert 
this squeal to a mother is a distress call dow said 
dow and covert also an assistant professor of communication at 
the university were to present their findings sunday at the 
national convention of the association for education in journalism 
and mass communications in minneapolis 
dow noticed the effects while working in a computer laboratory 
at another university 
these computers bugged me she said i was very very 
strung out sometimes i could hear it and sometimes i couldnt 
the couples studies show women can be affected by the noise 
even when they cant consciously hear it she said 
but men are rarely bothered because most of them cannot hear 
the 16kilohertz puretone sound at all she said men generally 
cannot hear frequencies above 15 khz while women can hear up to 18 
khz dow said 
such pure tones are more distressing than the broadrange sounds 
people more commonly hear in their environment she said 
dow and covert became interested in computer noise after 
observing headaches fatigue and irritability in female students 
working with classroom computers 
in the fall of 1987 they came to the university of evansville 
which agreed to support their research 
in their first test in april 1987 41 students were asked to do 
clerical tasks in a room where the sound was created at about the 
level of normal conversation 
what we found was they speeded up and doubled their errors 
when exposed to the sound dow said those are symptoms of 
high stress 
in march 1990 the couple set up a second test using 100 female 
students the group was asked to spend a morning taking the 
graduate record exam half of them working while exposed to the 
tone 
the experimental group did anywhere from 8 percent to 95 
percent worse than the control group dow said 
the couple said they hope their research will be duplicated and 
expanded by other researchers they wonder if further study could 
link the noise with miscarriages and other health problems linked 
to computers 
in the meantime there is some relief for people who find the 
tone irritating dow said 
switching to a highdefinition monitor should solve the problem 
those monitors operate at twice the frequency producing a noise 
well above the human hearing range 
when noisy monitors cant be avoided foam ear plugs can offer 
temporary relief by reducing the intensity of highpitched sounds 
without affecting ordinary conversation

the refugees walk in single file the 
only sounds are bare feet slapping softly the scuffle of shoes 
soaked by the constant rain and the crackle of gunfire 
at any moment they can be pulled out of the long line and shot 
if the rebels fighting to oust president samuel doe suspect them 
of being former government soldiers summary executions are common 
the faces of the refugees in congo town an eastern suburb of 
the liberian capital are drained of emotion they rarely speak 
stepping impassively across the bodies littering the roadside 
every question where are you from where are you going what 
has happened to you draws the same response 
i dont know they murmur if they answer at all i dont 
know 
one man pushes a wheelbarrow holding a whitehaired old man who 
bounces among burlap bags stuffed with belongings 
tens of thousands of refugees have fled the capitals eastern 
suburbs since the rebels began closing in on does executive 
mansion 
it is a lastditch bid to oust liberias leader of 10 years 
before the arrival of more than 2000 west african peacekeepers who 
have orders to enforce a truce by force if necessary 
most of those fleeing had been trapped behind government lines 
and were only able to move after the rebels advanced and the 
fighting moved past them 
all the men especially younger ones risk arrest if they are 
suspected of being government deserters or members of does krahn 
tribe who can be identified by their tribal language 
most of those displaced by the fighting make their way toward a 
temporary refugee camp set up at the university of liberias fendel 
campus 12 miles northeast of monrovia 
an estimated 180000 people have crowded into the camp which 
has no water little food and no means of caring for the new 
arrivals 
another 400000 liberians already have fled the 7monthold war 
to neighboring states thousands of others are displaced elsewhere 
in the country 
journalists who visited the fendel camp report the rebels 
provide rice from time to time but the fighters eat first 
the only help for the refugees comes from 12 doctors and eight 
nurses of the belgian branch of the humanitarian organization 
doctors without borders 
on saturday they evacuated st josephs hospital in congo town 
where they had been caring for 500 civilians government soldiers 
and rebels wounded in the fighting it was the last operating 
hospital in the wartorn city 
most of the patients were well enough to walk but about 80 
seriously wounded people were taken in a convoy of 40 vehicles to 
the town of gbarnga about 100 miles northeast of monrovia where 
the doctors plan to set up at another hospital 
life in liberia is so hard that even warbattered lebanon looks 
like a safe haven a group of 152 lebanese refugees arrived in 
beirut saturday after a 48hour overland journey from liberia to 
sierra leone they flew to beirut aboard a chartered middle east 
airlines jet 
ali matar who has lived in monrovia for the past 10 years told 
reporters the war had left the country devastated 
there is no water no food supplies he said fighting was 
so ferocious that we had to stay indoors for more than 20 days and 
since there are no underground shelters our lives were in danger 
he said a convoy of 46 cars carrying about 222 lebanese left 
liberia for sierra leone early tuesday and arrived two days later 
matar said another group of 70 lebanese was expected in beirut

q mr president can you tell us the state of play on thinking 
of inaudible 
president bush well the good news is that no shipping from 
iraq is coming through the straits of hormuz and we are in 
consultation active consultation with other powers who have naval 
vessels there or under way to be sure that no oil goes out but we 
arent prepared to announce anything more than that but i think in 
terms of the world market and in terms of the effectiveness of the 
sanctions i can tell you that with the exception of one small 
tanker i believe it was no vessels from iraq or kuwaiti ports are 
trying to get out of there with cargo with oil cargo 
q sir if i may followup have you made the decision in 
principle anyway to impose this kind of 
bush i made the decision in principle and i think most other 
leaders have that the sanctions will be fully enforced and that 
exports from iraq will not get into the get into the market 
q mr president could we ask at this point with all of the 
diplomatic efforts that youve constructed what exactly is your 
strategy now if not simply just patience is that it 
bush no my strategy well the goal is to get iraq out 
obviously of kuwait and have the legitimate rulers return that is 
the goal and the strategy is to use economic sanctions fully 
effective to see that that happens and theres another part of 
our strategy and that is to show a willingness on the part of the 
united states and other countries to tell saddam hussein that 
aggression will not be successful and that friends will be 
protected 
q inaudible that with all of these sanctions in place and 
with the effective encirclement that you have going that therell 
be forces inside iraq who will rise up against hussein 
bush that sometimes happens when leaders get so out of touch 
with reality that they commit their country to outrageous acts 
that does happen and i know that some countries around the world 
are hoping that thatll happen in this situation but well have 
to wait and see

president bush suggested saturday 
that iraqi strongman saddam hussein risks overthrow from within 
unless he changes his spots pentagon sources said 
sophisticated us missiles capable of knocking out iraqi tanks and 
aircraft had been deployed in saudi arabia 
the administration said the economic quarantine of iraq was 
biting hard and expressed significant optimism now that arab 
troops were joining american forces in the armed defense of saudi 
arabia 
the administration said it was encouraged that 11 americans 
including 10yearold penelope nabokov were allowed to leave iraq 
overnight yet an estimated 3800 americans remain in iraq and 
kuwait prevented from leaving 
we think it would be a mistake to characterize it as a hostage 
situation and to use a word like that since we are in discussion 
with iraq with respect to the matter secretary of state james 
a baker iii said he said there was no indication any americans 
have been mistreated 
from his vacation home on the coast of maine bush turned up the 
heat on saddam a day after the iraqi leader declared a holy 
war against countries uniting against his invasion of kuwait 
bush consulted arab leaders on the growing multinational military 
buildup in the saudi desert 
bush said the united states was not prepared to support saddams 
ouster but said that some countries around the world are hoping 
that that will happen he said such an ouster sometimes happens 
when leaders get so out of touch with reality that they commit 
their country to outrageous acts 
the military buildup grew in the persian gulf and their were 
fresh indications that a naval blockade was being readied against 
iraqi commerce 
up to 50000 us troops are expected to take up positions in 
saudi arabia in the coming weeks and pentagon sources say 
contingency plans call for as many as 250000 to be sent if iraq 
makes a military move into saudi arabia 
in riyadh diplomatic sources said saudi arabian antiaircraft 
batteries on saturday fired at two iraqi reconnaissance planes near 
the border with kuwait they said the planes turned back without 
crossing the border 
pentagon sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
patriot groundtoair missiles were earmarked for deployment in 
saudi arabia and that us stinger shoulderfired guided missiles 
already had arrived in the kingdom as the united states prepares 
for a possible iraqi invasion 
other antiaircraft missiles to be deployed include the 
chaparral a supersonic mobile heatseeking missile that is capable 
of knocking out aircraft and helicopters at low altitude the 
sources said 
while praising the success of sanctions to enforce a united 
nations trade embargo against iraq the white house said that 
planning for a blockade is underway should it be necessary 
bush said the good news is that no shipping from iraq is 
coming through the straits of hormuz and added that the united 
states was working with other naval forces in the region to be 
sure that no oil goes out but we arent prepared to announce 
anything more than that 
asked about a blockade bush said ive made the decision in 
principle and i think most other leaders have that the sanctions 
will be fully enforced and that exports from iraq will not get into 
the market 
right now the united nations sanctions are being widely 
implemented and there is no iraqi oil leaving turkey or saudi 
arabia said marlin fitzwater the presidents spokesman 
pipelines through saudi arabia and turkey are the primary outlets 
for carrying iraqs oil 
the embargo appears to be having considerable effect 
fitzwater added 
fitzwater said the us embassy in baghdad was in contact 
almost hourly with iraqi officials concerning the safety of the 
3800 americans in kuwait and iraq 
bush met with baker and other top advisers to review 
developments later in a news conference bush was asked whether 
he would support the ouster of saddam 
were not prepared to support the overthrow but i hope that 
these actions that have been taken will result in an iraq that is 
prepared to live peacefully in a community of nations bush said 
and if that means saddam hussein changes his spots so be it and 
if he doesnt i hope the iraqi people do something about it so 
that their leader will live by the norms of international behavior 
that will be acceptable to other nations 
on the first full day of a 25day vacation bush found time for 
leisure time activity too despite a driving rain he went out 
during the morning on his racing boat fidelity he also played 
golf in the rain 
he was up early to press diplomatic efforts by phone at 545 
am the president called egyptian president hosni mubarak and 
congratulated him on the arab summit meeting which decided friday 
to send arab troops to saudi arabia 
bush also called king fahd of saudi arabia and the emirs of 
bahrain and qatar 
i think things are moving in the right direction bush told 
reporters were pleased so far with the solidarity 
cohesiveness of the economic actions that have been taken 
bush said saddam was increasingly isolated as demonstrated by 
the arab summits commitment of troops to saudi arabia bush said 
that was a promising development in view of saddams outrageous 
rhetoric and outrageous military action against kuwait 
bush said he hoped that economic sanctions would deter saddam 
he said the united states and other nations must prove their 
willingness to tell saddam hussein that aggression will not be 
successful and that friends will be protected 
asked if forces in iraq might rise up against saddam bush 
replied 
i know that some countries around the world hope thatll 
happen in this situation but well have to wait and see bush 
said my feeling is that whatever it takes to have our objectives 
met is what should take place 
the president noted differences with jordans king hussein who 
came to saddams defense after his forces invaded kuwait 
bush said the jordanian monarch has been a friend of the 
united states for a long time and id like to see that friendship 
be reinstated or be reinvigorated in the future he said hussein 
whose country borders iraq was in a difficult position 
on a related front bush said it appeared that oil prices were 
moderating after sharp increased 
we are using every diplomatic channel we can to be sure that 
there are no shortages and there is no gouging and there isnt some 
profit windfall made by out of these most unfortunate events

all the prurient interest in the affair hasnt made life easy on 
local roman catholics they are responding with compassion toward 
the priests anxiety for their church and irritation with the media 
its a very painful process for all of us said the rev 
peter dora a spokesman for the archdiocese but there is a very 
significant level of support mostly by mail 
theyre making too much out of this said 63yearold neil 
brogan when she heard that her priest the rev michael woods 
resigned because of his ties to ms long theyre human beings 
not gods 
ms longs saga with the church began when she filed a paternity 
suit against a columbus priest the rev donal keohane claiming he 
fathered her 4yearold daughter ladonna michelle keohane denied 
the charge and blood tests proved he could not be the father but 
the church is paying child support 
church officials two weeks ago confirmed reports that archbishop 
eugene marino who stepped down as the nations highestranking 
black catholic in july had resigned because of an intimate 
relationship with ms long that involved paying her 1500 monthly 
the archdiocese is conducting an audit to see whether church funds 
were used 
two days later woods resigned because of his relationship with 
ms long 
dora said friday that marino was admitted to a psychiatric unit 
at an undisclosed hospital late thursday 
ms long who was relieved of her lay minister duties at st 
john the evangelist church has refused to comment but her 
attorney anthony fontana said she was victim of sexual abuse who 
turned to marino for help and then was manipulated by him 
ms long claims she and marino were secretly married but denies 
having a sexual relationship with woods who is her daughters 
godfather 
ms long flew to chicago thursday to discuss possibly airing her 
story with oprah winfrey who hosts a syndicated tv talk show 
we dont know what to believe anymore said mary bishop who 
attends ms longs hapeville church if shes right whats that 
say about the priests but if shes wrong shes dragged us all 
into the mud for nothing 
the everchanging allegations come just months after another 
scandal rocked the atlanta archdiocese which covers 69 counties 
and about 175000 catholics 
the rev anton mowat a visiting priest from britain who spent 
two years as associate pastor of a stone mountain church was 
accused of molesting four altar boys during a 12month period 
ending in october 1987 he disappeared before his arrest but was 
found in england in january mowat was sentenced to six years in 
prison in may and the archdiocese settled a lawsuit by three of 
the boys parents by agreeing to pay 358000 
its sad that this had to come just after the news about 
mowat finally died down said cynthia kennedy of atlanta 
interviewed as she left st anthonys catholic church we thought 
that was bad enough 
many catholics are rallying around the church bishop james p 
lyke the acting archdiocese administrator said the scandal had 
prompted an avalanche of people who care to call their churches 
peoples feelings about their ministers arise from their 
personal relationships with them you will find these in a great 
degree very positive lyke said 
one priest said members of his congregation were concerned about 
the allegations 
but so many feel that the situation has just grown too 
bizarre and they are deeply worried about whether bishop marino 
and father woods will survive

percent the secondhighest total since he took office a newsweek

retaliation if iraqi troops struck against us troops 79 percent 
favored a us strike if the iraqis killed us civilians in kuwait

bush my my feeling is that whatever it takes to have our 
objectives met is what should take place yeah ann 
q mr president who is in command of the multinational force 
thats on the ground in saudi arabia now and who will take the 
lead 
bush well general schwarzkopf is in command of the united 
states forces and then arrangements are being worked out as these 
other countries send components to have a more detailed structure 
and clearly the were in saudi arabia at the invitation of the 
king they have forces the saudis have forces on the ground so 
we will be very sensitive to the requirements of the saudi 
government 
q but will it be the saudis who are actually in control of 
bush well as i say the arrangements i dont believe i can 
ask general scowcroft 
gen brent scowcroft still working it out 
bush still being worked out 
q yesterday you said that maybe just maybe somebody could 
talk some sense into saddam so hell retreat and back off but you 
said you werent optimistic following the events of the past 24 
hours with the arab league are you any more optimistic 
bush well i i dont know about being optimistic or 
pessimistic but i must say that the forthright position taken by 
the arab summit is very very positive and it must make saddam 
hussein realize how isolated he is in terms of world opinion there 
have been many manifestations of that before the arab summit but 
now with the arab countries weighing in in spite of his outrageous 
saddams outrageous rhetoric and outrageous military action 
against kuwait id say thats very promising 
q mr president you said a moment ago you supported doing 
whatever it takes to meet your objectives does that include 
overthrowing saddam hussein 
bush ill just leave it sit out there and everybody can figure 
it out and they can see the mobilization of forces and they can 
see the determination on the part of the whole world to make these 
economic sanctions be successful 
q mr president could you give us any optimistic report on 
efforts to get out nondiplomatic american citizens who are caught 
up there

bush well i might ask secretary baker to comment on that but 
some americans have come out today but jim do you want to can 
you add anything to that 
baker simply repeat what i said yesterday in brussels and that 
is that we are still discussing this matter with representatives of 
the government of iraq we are hopeful that well be able to 
resolve the situation because it does after all run against all 
international norms the fact that american citizens and other 
foreign nationals as well are not permitted to leave iraq or to 
leave kuwait 
q why do you not believe this constitutes a hostage situation 
since they are in fact detained 
baker well nothing has been demanded or asked in connection 
with permitting them to leave the country for one thing and we 
think it would be a mistake to characterize it as a hostage 
situation and to use a word like that since we are in discussion 
with respect to the matter and as far as we know no american 
citizens have as yet been mistreated 
q will you keep the kuwaiti embassy open mr secretary until 
unless the iraqis force it closed is that what it will take to 
close the iraqi embassy in kuwait city 
baker thats a matter that frankly we are discussing today 
and we will continue to discuss it the european community the 
asean nations and others have all told iraq that they are going to 
maintain their embassies because they do not want to give credence 
to the suggestion that iraq has somehow annexed kuwait i think 
its important to remember that not only do we have these loyal 
government officials there but we have 3800 american citizens in 
kuwait as well 
q mr president theres now reports there may be as many as a 
quartermillion american troops going to saudi arabia 
bush again im not prepared to comment on troop numbers ive 
tried to make that clear i believe that secretary of defense 
dick cheney and joint chiefs of staff chairman colin powell have 
taken that same position and as long as forces are moving were 
just going to leave it there 
q but sir is a quartermillion out of the realm of 
possibility 
bush you must have misunderstood me i said im 
not going to comment on that 
q mr president did you talk to king hussein 
bush yeah yeah just a sec 
q on the subject of why dont you go over there 
bush okay laughter no i did not talk to king hussein the 
two other arab leaders that i talked to today were the rulers of 
qatar and bahrain 
q there seems to be some concern that jordan is something of a 
back door for iraq both in terms of being able to provide a supply 
line and also perhaps further military exercises what are you 
saying or trying to do to convince hussein that he should perhaps 
go along with the rest of his arab neighbors 
bush well you know it was interesting at the arab summit that 
jordan did not vote against the resolution and they i believe 
they abstained but in any event they were not against we all 
recognize the difficult position that king hussein is in 
theres no question to that and in my view he has been a 
friend to the united states for a long time and id like to see 
that friendship be reinstated or be reinvigorated in the future 
hes in a difficult position and i was pleased that he did not 
vote against that resolution yesterday 
but lets face it we have had some differences with jordan over 
what initially appeared to be a little bit of a strong backing for 
saddam hussein so were we respect the territorial integrity of 
jordan we respect its sovereignty and i will not kind of go into 
hypothetical situations as what might happen to jordan but it is a 
relationship that presidents for years have valued and its one 
that i hope we can restore through a lot of contact to its vitality 
in the future 
i think i spoke quite candidly the other day when i said there 
was a certain disappointment factor there but now with what the 
king was able to do yesterday perhaps we can find ways to move 
forward i would like to do that when all of this comes down 
q whats your next step mr president now

bush my next step is to stay in touch with the situation over 
there and to implement the plan that is already in effect and that 
is to do what we can to guarantee the total effectiveness of the 
chapter vii sanctions and then take further steps that im not 
prepared to discuss in detail that will guarantee the integrity of 
saudi arabia for openers and by being there offer some moral 
support at least for countries in the area who could be threatened 
in the future from this saddam hussein 
q mr president some said yesterdays arab summit effectively 
exhausted the diplomatic solution do you feel that as well is the 
next step military 
bush no i think weve still got plenty of diplomacy to ahead 
of us with lots of countries and lots of and in lots of different 
avenues so i wouldnt say that 
q but how do you get to saddam hussein whos not listening to 
anybody 
bush well we have you know these economic sanctions havent 
been in effect very long already as ive indicated there are 
some signs that they are going to have an effect and well just 
have to wait and see these kinds of actions cannot be judged 48 
hours after theyre put into place or 72 or whatever i think 
weve just got to wait and see how all of this develops 
but i think he does see today more clearly than he saw yesterday 
at this time that the world is united against him and by that i 
mean the action of the arab summit was very very important in this 
regard so these things are happening as we go along now different 
countries taking strong positions so id say theres still room 
for more diplomacy but well just have to wait and see whether 
this whether it makes an impact on him 
yeah michael 
q mr president would you like to see a united nations 
military force and can you tell us specifically what other 
countries are you expecting to put troops on the ground in saudi 
arabia 
bush no i cant tell you what others but i think youll see 
others and i know youll see others and i cannot prematurely 
say who they will be and in terms of the united nations i think 
that there could be a role in the naval side for some un role but 
i dont think that our plans are contingent upon a un flag flying 
over the effort as was the case in korea for example

president hosni mubarak said saturday he 
believes there is no hope for a peaceful solution to iraqs 
invasion and occupation of kuwait 
his comments came a day after the arab league passed a 
resolution calling for the dispatch of troops to saudi arabia and 
supporting mandatory economic sanctions imposed by the united 
nations against iraq 
egypt and morocco immediately sent advance units to saudi 
arabia diplomatic sources said the two arab countries were each 
expected to provide 5000 troops 
after the first egyptian and moroccan troops landed saudi 
arabian antiaircraft guns fired about 10 rounds saturday to deter 
two iraqi reconnaisance planes close to the border with kuwait 
diplomatic sources said the planes turned back without crossing 
the border the sources said requesting anonymity 
iraq denied any of its planes crossed the border but did not say 
whether any of its aircraft came under fire 
when asked by reporters if he believed there was any chance of a 
peaceful solution to the iraq crisis mubarak said 
i want to tell you honestly and note that i am always 
optimistic there is no hope for that 
it is unclear if the arab troops will join with the thousands of 
american soldiers deployed in the desert kingdom 
arab states have repeatedly called for arab troops to protect 
saudi arabia from iraqi troops massing on the saudikuwaiti border 
the solution for the gulf crisis should be purely arab said 
sudanese leader lt gen omar hassan elbashir 
the independent tunisian daily assabah wrote an arab 
solution bad as it may be is a thousand times better than what an 
american intervention could bring about the united states has only 
caused misfortune to arabs 
twelve of the 21 arab league members supported the measure 
while nine either voted against it abstained or expressed 
reservations 
there have been demonstrations in jordan yemen libya and 
mauritania to protest against the massive american buildup in saudi 
arabia 
algerian foreign minister ahmed alghazali said saturday we 
had rejected all intervention direct or indirect by foreigners in 
considering solutions 
in his saturday interview with reporters mubarak repeatedly 
blasted arab delegates for their ineffective and disruptive 
behavior at fridays emergency session of the arab league 
what a racket it was noisy with everyone wanting to speak i 
like organization so imagine two or three talking together at the 
same time mubarak said his comments were carried by the middle 
east news agency 
he said at one point palestine liberation organization chairman 
yasser arafat asked to address the summit and he started talking 
about the mediation between afghanistan and kashmir 
i explained to him that we were here to solve the problem of 
kuwait and asked if they had any solutions the egyptian 
president added 
i called for a summit hoping we would find a way out but they 
sat and exchanged accusations mubarak said a few talked 
well but no one came up with a realistic and practical solution 
he also explained why a proposal to send an arab league 
delegation to iraq failed 
i refuse to go to baghdad because i know the result in 
advance i asked the people on the list if they wanted to go to 
baghdad as a mediation committee but none of them responded and no 
one volunteered to go he said 
the early sunday editions of the stateowned cairo newspapers 
alahram and alakhbar accused arafat of supporting saddam and 
deliberately trying to stop the summit from reaching any 
resolutions 
the most important landmark of this summit was the crazy 
attempts by the iraqi and palestinian delegations to sabotage the 
summit alakhbars editor galal dewidar wrote 
he said that kuwaits deposed emir sheik jaber alahmed 
alsabah wore a bulletproof vest to the summit after learning 
that taha yassin ramadan iraqs deputy premier was carrying his 
personal handgun

the plucky spirit of 10yearold penelope 
nabokov surprised even her father he said saturday after a desert 
caravan brought the girl to the safety of jordan after nine days in 
occupied kuwait 
the spirit that sometimes keeps her mother and i trembling was 
still there peter nabokov said shes obviously being treated 
well i had the sense that she was moving through and was 
protected by a field of very wellmeaning people 
penelope reached freedom in jordan on saturday after a 72hour 
660mile journey with 10 other americans in several cars she had 
been trapped in kuwait when iraqi forces invaded aug 2 
i asked her if she was ok and she said well dad how would 
you feel if you had been driving across the desert for 72 hours 
nabokov told reporters outside city hall in the familys hometown 
of albany a suburb of oakland 
the border crossing was a bit dicey i gather he said the 
americans twice ran into difficulty because they lacked proper 
permits and had to call on diplomats to negotiate passage he said 
she didnt tell me about the food she didnt tell me about 
where she was sleeping he said details didnt stick in my 
mind as much as the cool deliberative way in which she described 
her movements she was reporting to dad 
nabokov said penelope told him she wanted to come home and see 
her friends who have been closely following her plight but 
instead nabokov said he planned to fly to france on sunday to 
meet with his daughter and his wife isabelle 
he did not elaborate on the familys plans to return to the 
united states 
penelope was on her way to join isabelle nabokov in india when 
the episode began with the girls british airways flight making an 
unfortunately timed stopover in kuwait 
despite the ordeal she was in phenomenally good spirits well 
spoken describing everything with a reporters memory nabokov 
said 
the experience hasnt soured her on travel her father said 
shes made frequent trips abroad with her parents both 
anthropologists and has been traveling alone since age 6 nabokov 
also speculated that her status as a solo traveler probably helped 
her get released more quickly 
penelopes spirits remained strong during most of her ordeal 
although her father said she broke into tears while speaking to her 
mother after the girl was released to the american embassy in 
kuwait a few days ago 
i got the impression it wasnt so much out of fear as it was 
out of anger peter nabokov said adding that she was worried 
about three other children still stranded at a kuwait hotel where 
she had stayed with other passengers stranded because of the 
stopover 
he identified them as 14yearold vinil polam an indian girl 
traveling alone and the bazners 6yearold elizabeth and her 
infant brother kevin who are traveling with their parents dawn 
and david 
at the time of the invasion penelope was flying unaccompanied 
from france to india where she was to have joined her mother in 
kuwait she was taken into custody by iraqi soldiers and later 
brought to baghdad with some of the passengers from the plane 
the 11 americans who included some personnel from the us 
embassy in baghdad and their dependents drove in several cars from 
the iraqi capital to the jordanian border outpost of ruweishid on 
saturday 
there they were met by us officials penelope was allowed to 
pass the jordanian border post without any formalities according 
to an ap photographer at the scene and she left for amman by car 
with a us embassy staff member 
the rest of the group made the fivehour 210mile trip by 
embassy bus

q how critical is it that there be other troops besides 
americans 
bush well they are there and thats very important 
q mr president is the united states prepared in any way to 
support the overthrow of saddam 
bush no were not prepared to support the overthrow but i 
hope that these actions that have been taken will result in an iraq 
that is prepared to live peacefully in the community of nations 
and if that means saddam hussein 
changes his spots so be it and if he doesnt i hope the iraqi 
people will do something about it so that their leader will live 
by the norms of international behavior that will be acceptable to 
other nations 
this is the last one yeah 
q mr president we all noticed yesterday that you didnt want 
to use the word blockade is that because in your own mind 
right now you consider that the chapter vii sanctions enable you 
legally to stop an iraqi ship or two 
bush i think we have the authority to stop a ship at sea under 
chapter vii there may be some difference of opinion on that but 
theres no use using using words that may have may have 
different connotations in different countries and this one does in 
terms of legality and so why do that what we want to do is see 
that no oil comes out through the straits of hormuz and if it 
requires naval vessels to see that that that happens fine but i 
just am not one who who flamboyantly believes in throwing a lot 
of words around im more interested in action and so ive 
been very pleased that the iraqis are recognize that the export 
of oil is almost an impossibility now but weve got weve got 
some more diplomacy to make sure that it is a total impossibility 
thank you all very much glad its cleared up 
q can the oil companies 
bush well i think theres been a lightening up of on the 
pricing and were theres a lot of efforts under way to see that 
theres plenty of supply in the international market and if 
anybodys familiar those for those who are familiar with the 
availability of production that isnt on the market one would 
conclude that other countries can be helpful in making up the loss 
from kuwait and loss from iraq so to the american people i would 
say we are using every diplomatic channel we can to be sure that 
there are no shortages and there is no gouging and that there isnt 
some profit windfall made by out of these most unfortunate events 
but im confident that there can be stability in the 
international oil market because there is excess capacity around 
the world and some countries have stepped up and said they want to 
help and we salute them for that and so im and im encouraged 
and by how the diplomacy is working there and yet we still have 
more to do to guarantee that there not be a lot of hardship for 
countries around the world 
thank you all very very much thank you

the americans in kuwait are mostly oil 
workers or diplomats but there are also us lawyers physicians 
engineers and bankers in the country 
in addition there are school teachers and university 
professors and about 200 kuwaitis married to americans the oil 
workers are consultants engineers and bluecollar workers 
the state department said there were about 3800 americans 
registered with the us embassy at the time of the invasion but 
it is believed many of them were outside the country on summer 
vacation 
there are an estimated 150 embassy staff and dependents 
according to kuwaitis who knew the embassy some estimates run as 
high as 250 
they were living in a compound attached to the embassy but 
travelers reaching bahrain think the us diplomats have all moved 
into the embassy proper which is more fortified 
most of them are believed to have been in the country at the 
time of the invasion and apparently were still there a week later 
including ambassador wilson nathaniel howell 
getty oil co which was operating on the kuwaiti side of the 
divided zone along the borders with saudi arabia was able to 
evacuate 100 american families to the neighboring kingdom as the 
first waves of iraqi troops rumbled across the borders

saudi arabian antiaircraft 
batteries on saturday fired at two iraqi reconnaissance planes near 
the kuwaiti border with the kingdom diplomatic sources said 
a saudi arabian official denied the incident took place iraq 
denied any of its planes crossed the border but did not say 
anything about whether any of its aircraft came under fire us 
sources could not immediately confirm the report 
the diplomatic sources in saudi arabia who spoke on condition 
of anonymity said the saudis fired about 10 rounds at the planes 
in the khafji region close to the border to deter them 
they said the planes turned back without actually crossing the 
border 
a saudi official denied there had been any firing at iraqi 
planes 
it is not true at all the first bullet will not be from 
saudi arabia said the official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
iraqs official baghdad radio quoting a spokesman said none 
of our aircraft conducted any sortie over saudi territory 
the spokesman said the reports were some sort of prattle and 
buffoonery propagated by the suspect quarters that are seeking to 
undermine great iraq or to attack it 
in washingon col miguel monteverde a pentagon spokesman said 
he was aware of the report but that its unconfirmed by american 
sources the state departments kuwait desk said it also was 
unable to confirm the report 
contingents of egyptian and moroccan troops landed in the 
kingdom early saturday in line with an arab summit decision 
diplomatic sources said they said the egyptian force was highly 
trained in chemical warfare 
the arab troops began taking positions side by side with the 
american contingents that preceded them as tension mounted in the 
region with the first saudi firing in the khafji border region with 
iraqioccupied kuwait 
it was unclear how the egyptian and morrocan troops would be 
deployed with american soldiers in saudi arabia but all the forces 
were landing at the same northeastern saudi base 
the pentagon has committed 50000 ground troops but the number 
could skyrocket if iraq invades with forces massed on the 
kuwaitsaudi border 
iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 and took over the emirate within 
hours

the crisis touched off by iraqs invasion of 
kuwait is shattering old alliances in the middle east creating 
surprising new lineups and possibly opening opportunities for the 
united states to rebuild its oncefast friendship with iran 
that in turn could lead to fresh opportunities to try to win 
freedom for six americans long held hostage by proiranian factions 
in lebanon 
alliances shift constantly in the middle east and the latest 
round of change flowing directly from iraqs invasion of kuwait 
and threat to saudi arabia already has produced unexpected results 
for their own reasons israel syria and iran are lined up with 
the united states and in effect with each other in a unlikely 
coalition against iraq 
at the same time jordan is risking its reputation for 
moderation by tilting toward iraqi president saddam hussein and 
egyptian president hosni mubarak is winning admiration in 
washington for his efforts to rally arabs against iraq 
perhaps the most startling development involves the united 
states and iran which held 52 americans hostage for 444 days in 
197981 and regularly denounced america as the great satan 
secretary of state james a baker iii has authorized indirect 
talks with tehran creating a semblance of normal contacts that 
hasnt existed since relations were broken after the us embassy 
in tehran was seized in 1979 
from the iranian point of view nothing is more appealing than 
having the united states ready to cross swords with saddam for 
eight years iran waged relentless war against baghdad hoping to 
overthrow saddam after iraq invaded iran in 1980 
the effect on the fate of the hostages now in lebanon 
including terry anderson middle east correspondent of the 
associated press is unknown but president bush has made it clear 
since the day he took office that he would like to improve 
relations with the fundamentalist leaders in iran who are believed 
to hold sway over those holding the hostages 
baker also has sent john h kelly the assistant secretary of 
state for the near east to damascus to engage the syrians 
officially the state department still brands syria as a 
supporter of terrorism a notoriety lifted from iraq in 1983 
but president hafez assads hatred of saddam could be critical 
in the usengineered drive against iraq assad could divert 
iraqs military by sending troops to the common border or backing 
covert activities in iraq 
the threat to israel from iraq is obvious resulting from 
saddams threat to rain deadly chemical warheads on the jewish 
state but it took the iraqi seizure of kuwait to persuade the bush 
administration that saddam must be confronted 
iraqs ballistic missiles may not be capable of spanning the 500 
miles to israel but if iraqi troops moved into jordan either at 
the invitation of king hussein or against his will israel would be 
at greater risk 
king hussein announced wednesday that he would not let foreign 
forces use jordanian soil and a senior us official said friday 
there was no evidence he had 
the jordanian rulers tilt toward saddam seems odd considering 
the weapons and aid lavished on him over the years by the united 
states 
in an interview taped in jordan and broadcast saturday on the 
cnn evans and novak show hussein said the latest crisis occurs 
in this new world in which we live now no more a communist 
threat and therefore there is an industrial future for this world 
that depends on energy and i believe there is a struggle to try to 
control the sources of energy in this area 
we want to world to enjoy these sources of energy he said 
but we want also to be recognized as the people on whose land 
this very important commodity exists 
the king is a logical middleman should negotiations seem 
possible with saddam but the jordanian leader is fast losing his 
credit in washington 
obviously he has put himself in a position now that is 
difficult for him said a senior american official speaking on 
condition of anonymity i think he hoped he can be a mediator 
but there doesnt look to be much of a basis for mediation and i 
dont know how it enhances his credibility in the arab world or the 
outside to associate himself with saddam hussein 
egyptian president mubarak on the other hand is actively 
trying to heal the rift between iraq and the conservative saudi 
monarchy 
the arab summit meeting he hosted in cairo voted friday to send 
arab troops to saudi arabia to confront the iraqis 
it was a watershed event 
but mubaraks success in giving what us defense secretary dick 
cheney calls an arab face to the american military deployment 
in saudi arabia also shattered arab brotherhood 
only 12 of the 21 members of the arab league voted to send 
troops to protect saudi arabia and other gulf states from iraq and 
to impose economic sanctions to punish the baghdad government 
opposing the move were iraq the palestine liberation organization 
and libya and expressing reservations were jordan sudan and 
mauritania others abstained 
these divisions may deepen and turn more bitter when the arab 
league tries to enforce its decision 
still mubaraks diplomatic success enhances the admiration the 
bush administration holds for the egyptian president 
the saudis meanwhile are generating sympathy that could have a 
concrete payoff already baker and cheney are promoting the idea 
of selling the saudis at least a dozen f15 jet fighters 
they hope iraqs takeover of kuwaits oil fields and the threat 
to the rich saudi fields will force israels supporters in congress 
to drop their opposition to the deal 
meanwhile jordan is not alone in risking its reputation for 
moderation 
yasser arafats palestine liberation organization which has 
been gaining ground in its campaign against israel by lowering its 
rhetoric is in saddam husseins corner so is libya whose leader 
col moammar gadhafi has been seen consistently as an extremist

palestinians in the occupied territories 
marched saturday with iraqi flags and posters of saddam hussein in 
support of his invasion of kuwait arab reporters said 
more than 400 supporters of the palestine liberation 
organizations mainstream fatah faction took part in the biggest 
rally in nablus the west banks largest city and a hotbed of 
violence 
arab reporters said the marchers carried banners and waved the 
iraqi and the outlawed palestinian flags 
some palestinians hail saddam as a hero for standing up to the 
superpowers while the palestinians fight a seemingly hopeless 
battle against israeli rule 
the demonstrators carried pictures of the iraqi president and 
chanted slogans like go on go on we are with you saddam and 
saddam saddam attack attack saddam the reporters said 
israeli troops charged the demonstrators and fired tear gas to 
disperse them the reports said stonethrowing clashes erupted 
but there were no reports of any injuries they said 
other proiraq rallies and marches were held in the west bank 
town of tulkarem and in khan yunis and gaza city in the gaza strip 
arab reports said 
the army said its forces had dispersed two demonstrations in the 
west bank and that no one was injured 
during the 32month uprising 728 palestinians have been killed 
by israeli soldiers and civilians and another 247 slain as 
suspected collaborators by fellow arabs fortyseven israelis have 
been killed 
faisal husseini the leading proplo activist in the occupied 
lands said the palestinian support for iraq was largely a sign of 
frustration over the us failure to force israel to withdraw from 
the west bank and gaza strip 
it is not that the palestinians support the regime in iraq or 
believe in saddam huseins ideology but because they believe there 
is a double standard in the area he said in a recent interview 
with the associated press 
also saturday deputy foreign minister binyamin netanyahu said 
the united states so far has not asked israel to take military 
action in the persian gulf crisis

iran indicated saturday it is willing to 
cooperate with other persian gulf states to put pressure on iraq 
but did not say whether iranian troops would be sent to the region 
iran is prepared for any kind of cooperation with the 
countries of the region which may restore peace and tranquility and 
prevent the presence and influence of the superpowers in the 
persian gulf tehran radio said 
the broadcast monitored in nicosia added serious pressure 
must be brought to bear on iraq and iran is ready to cooperate 
with countries in the region to achieve peace and prevent a 
superpower presence 
a usled multinational force has been deployed in saudi arabia 
to block any iraqi invasion egyptian and moroccan troops arrived 
in the desert kingdom saturday as the advance guard of a force that 
12 arab league countries agreed to send at their summit in cairo 
iran whose forces are battlehardened after fighting an 
eightyear war with iraq has not indicated whether it is prepared 
to send troops to support the multinational forces 
but tehran television also monitored in nicosia said that the 
supreme security council warned saturday that iran is prepared to 
protect its interests under all conditions 
the council headed by president hashemi rafsanjani added that 
the buildup of foreign forces in the region and in the persian 
gulf waters has heightened the crisis 
iran is concerned about the situation in the region it 
added 
iran which considers itself the most powerful regional state 
would like to be seen as the policeman of the gulf and is 
suspicious of any us attempt to take on such a role following 
iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
iran is unlikely to send troops to protect saudi arabia from an 
iraqi attack given its antiamerican stance and hatred of the saudi 
ruling family tehrans shiite moslem leaders have repeatedly 
called for the overthrow of the saudi monarchy members of the 
dominant sunni moslem sect 
kuwait and saudi arabia were among iraqs staunchest arab allies 
in the 198088 gulf war against persian iran 
that war which halted with a united nationssponsored 
ceasefire in august 1988 was never formally ended with a peace 
treaty 
iraqi president saddam hussein must keep a wary eye on iran and 
keep part of his 1millionstrong army stationed on his countrys 
eastern front 
if iraqi troops engage the multinational forces in saudi arabia 
iran could try to take advantage of iraqs international isolation 
to reclaim hundreds of square miles of territory lost in the 
closing weeks of the persian gulf war 
since the ceasefire the iranians have been calling in vain on 
the united nations to force saddam to withdraw iraqi troops from 
iranian territory

large ships were allowed to transit the 
houston ship channel from both directions simultaneously saturday

meanwhile salvage crews removed cleanup equipment from the bay 
which has been cluttered with skimmers vacuum trucks and booms

contractors today coast guard chief warrant officer mike shoul 
said our overflight this morning failed to find any sign of the 
oil well do a final assessment on monday 
a ban on shrimping in trinity and galbeston bays was lifted 
friday but orders against taking crabs and oysters remained in 
effect until laboratory tests for contamination of those species 
are completed this week

two barges under tow one barge sank and the other ruptured 
spilling heavy oil that threatened sensitive marshes birds and 
other wildlife

two dolphin activists charge they were run 
over by navy boats while trying to halt the testing of 1200pound 
explosives near the dry tortugas and the navy concedes the men 
could have been hit 
they used boats as weapons said russ rector was injured in 
fridays protest along with richard obarry the dolphin trainer 
for the flipper tv series of the 1960s 
they ran right over me rector said i dove down and by 
the grace of god im not chewed up by propellers 
obarry suffered a concussion and bruises according to a 
medical report from florida keys memorial hospital rector suffered 
a back injury and bruises and left the hospital with his right arm 
in a sling 
obarry 50 and rector 42 were dropped from a sea plane into 
the test zone in the gulf of mexico they were swimming with the 
aid of propellerdriven aqua scooters when they saw boats approach 
said lincoln obarry richards son and vice president of an 
activist group called the dolphin project 
the two were run over by a boat about 60 feet long and then 
repeatedly hit by other smaller boats rector said obarry said he 
was hit in the head and jabbed in the face with an aluminum pole 
its very bizarre very bizarre lincoln obarry said 
saturday its something i just couldnt believe would happen 
dolphin activists have demanded cancellation of the navy tests 
because of area dolphin sightings fishermen want the tests 
suspended because the region is home to several seafood varieties 
and environmentalists are concerned about possible damage to nearby 
coral reefs 
when asked for comment on the report ensign robin perkins at 
key west naval station said they in fact were trying to get in 
the way of the boats 
apparently they were pursued and one of the boats could have 
hit them said dan probert who is overseeing the navy trials 
the coast guard pulled the men from the water about 85 miles 
northwest of key west and delivered them to the hospital on 
stretchers 
we were told by the navy we had two injured people in the 
water said coast guard spokesman jeff karonis our only 
involvement was to help get the two injured people out of the water 
and bring them back to key west 
obarry who has previously taken part in guerrilla 
activities like cutting open dolphin cages under water began his 
latest campaign thursday he grabbed a plastic orange buoy floating 
over a navy bomb and held on for nine hours until he was returned 
to key west by the coast guard 
obarry and rector headed back to the test site friday but 
arrived about an hour after an explosive had been detonated 
lincoln obarry said

primary goal of his austerity program aimed at bringing the country 
out of its economic crisis inflation has been running at 3000

him on another and was deadlocked on 12 more barry said let 
their judgment be our last judgment 
in an emotional speech before some 500 people many of them 
chanting four more years barry did not directly address his 
own political future nor did he say whether he would appeal his 
conviction on a misdemeanor charge of cocaine possession 
but top political aides to the mayor speaking on condition of 
anonymity a few hours later said barry will run for a city council 
seat 
the mans life is politics and now that this trial is over 
he has decided he will run for the council said one top adviser 
who spoke with barry after the speech saturday this allows him 
to keep his hand in local politics earn a living and redeem 
himself 
but in his appearance which blended elements of a campaign 
rally and a revival meeting the mayor avoided discussing politics 
and instead apologized to the citys residents young and old 
black and white jew and gentile and he asked them to forgive 
me for any hurt i may have caused i hope that any of you who 
still harbor resentment and vengeance can let go 
barry had said repeatedly before the trial that he was being 
targeted for investigation in part because he is a prominent black 
leader 
us attorney jay stephens has not announced whether he will 
seek to retry the mayor on charges that the jury could not decide 
among them are three perjury counts and a cocaine possession charge 
backed by videotaped evidence of the mayor smoking crack cocaine in 
an fbi sting operation jan 18 at the vista intercontinental hotel 
he was arrested that night 
now is the time for healing barry said i call on the 
united states government to join in this healing 
barry 54 announced earlier that he would not seek reelection 
to a fourth term as democratic mayor of the nations capital this 
year but close associates confirmed that he plans to run for the 
13member council he served on the city council from 1974 until he 
was elected to his first mayoral term in 1978 
barry will make the first formal step of his candidacy when he 
changes his party affiliation from democrat to independent on 
monday the political sources said that move will qualify him for 
the november general election where he will face the winners of 
republican democrat and statehood party primaries in september 
they said he would seek one of two atlarge council seats being 
contested the top two votegetters will be elected 
in his remarks barry said he realized he had been behaving in 
ways that were not in keeping with the vows i made to my wife and 
he asked for her forgiveness she has granted it he said 
he reviewed his wellpublicized treatment for what he said was 
alcohol and prescription drug abuse 
theres no shame or disgrace in being addicted to anything 
he said the shame and disgrace is in not making the decision to 
seek help i could have believed i was bigger and badder than 
anything in this world but the quiet voice of god whispered to 
me and said take my hand 
barry whose remarks shifted in turn from contrition to 
confrontation had a few pointed remarks for prosecutors saying 
the us government must examine its conduct to see if its been 
in keeping with its responsibilities 
it was in everyones interest he said to insist that the 
government guard against a tendency to overreach in its zeal its 
zest to make a point 
im relieved that this trial is over barry said as he 
launched into criticism of the news media for what he considered 
excessive coverage of his case 
enough is enough he said and the audience picked up the 
chant echoing enough is enough 
barry spoke as others also urged prosecutors not to seek a 
retrial 
we are trying simply to say to the government that there is a 
time when both sides must step back from the battle lines that were 
drawn said barrys attorney r kenneth mundy it is not 
cowardly to do so 
we can think of no legitimate reason for the government to go 
to the expense and the resulting trauma of another trial said 
benjamin hooks executive director of the naacp we hope this 
brings this sad sad saga to a close 
the mayor faces a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a 
100000 fine for his conviction on a misdemeanor charge of cocaine 
possession he has not said whether he will appeal us district 
judge thomas penfield jackson has not yet set a sentencing date 
barry retained the support of about 20 percent of the citys 
electorate according to recent polls despite the sixweek trial 
in which prosecutors portrayed him as a regular cocaine user and a 
womanizer 
jurors in the case said they split down the middle on most of 
the deadlocked charges including the one that arose from an fbi 
sting operation that videotaped barry smoking crack cocaine 
one juror johnnie mae hardeman said the panel doubted the 
truthfulness and motives of barrys chief accusers who were 
themselves drug users 
some prominent civil rights leaders had suggested that barry was 
targeted for prosecution because he is black and hooks quickly 
urged the government to abandon its case george stallings a 
locally prominent black priest who was excommunicated after 
starting his own congregation echoed hooks sentiments and 
suggested jackson issue a light sentence in view of the jurys 
failure to convict barry on multiple counts 
while future prosecution of the mayor remains in doubt barry 
has no legal obstacles preventing him from running for office now 
under city law barry would have been barred from office if he had 
been convicted of any of the three felony perjury charges he faced 
but there is no such prohibition based on the misdemeanor 
conviction

the food and drug administration has approved 
major new clinical trials for a controversial drug believed to 
prolong the lives of aids victims and persons infected with the 
aids virus officials said saturday 
fda spokesman brad stone confirmed that hem research inc of 
philadelphia will conduct a doubleblind study using the 
antiviral compound ampligen beginning next month about 135 
patients in as many as eight cities will participate and neither 
the doctors nor patients will know who is receiving the drug or the 
placebo 
hems chief scientist william a carter is a coinventor of the 
new drug 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious 
disease that attacks the bodys immune system rendering it 
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections 
the incurable condition is believed caused by an unusual virus 
now called human immunodeficiency virus or hiv discovered in 
france and the united states the virus is spread through contact 
with blood or with semen from infected persons 
ampligen is designed to stimulate the bodys production of 
interferon a substance used by the immune system to fight viral 
infections 
the only antiviral drug approved currently to treat aids is azt 
this drug originally was known as azidothymidine but is now called 
zidovudine and is marketed by burroughs wellcome co as retrovir 
during the study ampligen will be administered in conjunction 
with azt 
in its only other study major study two years ago ampligen 
failed to work on about 300 men at hospitals in seven cities this 
time officials said doctors will try to determine whether 
ampligen can help patients maintain a healthy level of special 
cells that regulate the immune system rendered inactivated by the 
aids virus 
fda officials said that generally azt has been shown to keep the 
level of t4 cells at acceptable levels for several months after 
which the levels decline ampligen is expected to continue working 
long after azt has stopped and lessen azt side effects such as 
severe headaches gastrointestinal disorders and nausea 
hem officials said initial results will be released in the fall 
of 1991

a group of 32 foreign men women and 
children mostly americans and britons escaped across the desert 
from kuwait with the help of bedouin guides reaching bahrain on 
saturday a newspaper reported 
one woman in the group told the gulf daily news that she knew of 
at least four foreign women who were raped by iraqi soldiers in 
kuwait 
the englishlanguage newspaper in its sunday edition said the 
32 escapees included british american and irish expatriate workers 
and family members as well as one singapore citizen and a filipino 
woman the group included 11 women and seven children 
the escapees were led by john carlough of los angeles general 
manager in the consumer division of the gulf bank in kuwait who 
fled with his family the paper said he said his major regret was 
that he had brought his two children to kuwait for the summer 
holidays 
using bedouin guides who live in the desert and knew where to 
cross the expanses to avoid iraqi soldiers the group crossed the 
border into saudi arabia in a convoy of eight fourwheel drive 
vehicles the newspaper said they then traveled on to the island 
nation of bahrain 
it was not known when they fled kuwait 
carlough and his family as well as an american couple were 
apparently spirited away by us embassy officials after arriving 
in bahrain the embassy said they would contact reporters if they 
wanted to 
the group did not reveal their desert route in order to keep the 
information from the iraqis they said they gave a list of 
foreigners left behind to their guide drivers in the hope they 
would help others 
bob grimstead from bexley england was quoted as saying the 
bedouins could pinpoint a needle in the dark they knew all the 
dunes and rocks they were brilliant 
the convoy had to travel through deep sand dunes from which the 
cars had to be hauled out the report said 
the only time we got really frightened was when we had to pull 
out one vehicle and two tanks came over the dune said alan 
jones of selsdon england 
we saw the gun turrets move and it was terrifying we were 
only five minutes from the border and we really thought that was 
it but they didnt fire and they left us i dont know why he 
told the newspaper 
deedie mckenzie who escaped with her husband and three 
children told of rapes committed by iraqi troops who invaded 
kuwait on aug 2 
she said a west german neighbor in her 30s came screaming to 
her home after being raped by an iraqi soldier 
he came into their flat pointed a gun and locked the husband 
in the bathroom said ms mckenzie whose nationality was not 
given the soldier raped the woman and when he had finished sat 
down and had a cup of tea he then offered money to the couple and 
stole a gold cross before leaving 
they reported the rape to the iraqis who promised that if the 
soldier was found he would be shot ms mckenzie said she also knew 
of rape incidents involving two filipino women at the sas hotel and 
a british woman 
the escapees told the newspaper that the iraqi army was 
generally very disorganized with some of the troops as young as 17 
or 18 
they didnt know why they were there and apologized to 
kuwaitis said one of the escapees they had been told that 
their families would be shot if they did not join the army they 
were told that there had been a rebellion and the iraqi army had 
been called to help 
the iraqi soldiers also admitted they were scared of the 
americans they said they had no idea why they were there they 
were scared to their pants of the americans jones was quoted as

the irs says it has decided not to exhume the 
body of an iranian businessman who allegedly owed the government 
157000 when he died 
the us attorneys office earlier said it might want to dig up 
the body of ehsanolla motaghed 66 just to make sure hes dead 
this is a victory for the little people and a loss for the 
internal revenue service attorney james martin davis said friday 
of the governments decision not to exhume motaghed who was 
accused of paying an internal revenue service agent 4000 to 
reduce his tax liability 
motaghed died at his omaha apartment june 9 before he went to 
trial on the charge davis asked that the indictment against 
motaghed be dismissed and 110000 in us treasury notes posted as 
his bail be returned 
federal authorities first sought to reopen motagheds grave to 
make a positive identification that motaghed was buried there but 
a document filed last week in us district court indicated the 
us attorneys office does not dispute motagheds death and will 
not resist davis request to dismiss the indictment 
first assistant us attorney thomas thalken said his office had 
received information that convinced us that the person who 
allegedly was dead is dead 
the court document filed by assistant us attorney robert 
kokrda cited a levy against motagheds property for unpaid taxes 
totalling 157869 for the 1985 1986 and 1987 tax years he said 
the levy was appropriate since motaghed now is deceased 
kokrda asserted that the treasury notes put up as motagheds 
bond should be turned over to the irs magistrate richard kopf 
scheduled a hearing on the matter for thursday morning 
davis said the case was almost heartless in terms of what they 
have done to the family of motaghed 
thats about as inhumane as anything the ayatollah might do 
and they fled from the ayatollah davis said motaghed came to 
the united states 12 years ago after being expelled from iran by 
the government of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
motaghed ran an optical lens importing business when he was 
arraigned the us attorneys office said his assets were between 
750000 and 1 million

saudi arabian antiaircraft guns fired at two iraqi planes near 
the border with kuwait on saturday diplomatic sources said the

peaceful solution to the persian gulf crisis

planes turned back without crossing the border 
a saudi official denied the incident took place and said the 
first bullet will not be from saudi arabia the official spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
iraq denied any of its planes crossed the border but did not say 
whether any of its aircraft came under fire 
iraqs official radio quoted a spokesman as saying the reports 
were some sort of prattle and buffoonery propagated by the 
suspect quarters that are seeking to undermine great iraq or to 
attack it 
worldwide sanctions tightened a vise around iraqi president 
saddam hussein whose call for an arab holy war against saudi 
arabia was met instead with arab forces arriving to defend it iraq 
said it would execute any citizens that sells food on the black 
market 
syria and iran both enemies of iraq supported fridays 
decision of 12 of 21 arab league members to send troops and

force the soviet union also supported the arab league decision 
hoping it would lead to a speedy resolution to the crisis

kennebunkport me praised the arab action at a news conference 
it must make saddam hussein realize how isolated he is in 
terms of world opinion said bush who took a boat ride in the 
rain saturday the world is united against him 
a belligerent saddam who said he holds the saudis responsible 
for arab disunity now faces a growing multinational military force 
of ground and naval power and his oil flow vital to its ability 
to import food has been virtually cut off by a un condemnation 
of iraqs aug 2 blitzkrieg and absorption of kuwait 
in cairo mubarak was asked if believed there is a possibility 
of a peaceful solution to the persian gulf crisis i want to tell 
you honestly and note that i am always optimistic there is no 
hope of that mubarak said 
there were also indications that iraq is preparing for a world 
economic seige the ruling economic command council warned that 
selling food on the black market would be a criminal act of 
sabotage punishable by death 
in a statement broadcast saturday the council said the decision 
was taken to provide enough foodstuffs to all citizens and foil 
the cheats and the greedy ones 
the staterun radio also said enraged baghdad masses mobbed 
the saudi arabian and egyptian embassies the radio said the 
protesters chanted death to the enemies of iraq and the arab 
nation the inheritors of colonialist doctrine and protectors of 
zionism who are protecting their thrones with the bayonets of 
foreign troops 
iraq had sealed its borders after its lightning invasion 
trapping 3500 americans and other foreigners 
but penelope nabokov 10 of albany calif crossed the 
iraqijordanian frontier after a 660mile overland journey she was 
flying unaccompanied from france to india when she was taken into 
custody by iraqi soldiers in kuwait during a stopover she was 
later brought to baghdad with 10 other americans 
the girls father peter nabokov said she was in 
phenomenonally good spirits 
the americans who crossed into jordan included nonessential 
us embassy staff and dependents border officials said 
it was unclear how the egyptian and morrocan troops would be 
deployed with american soldiers but all the forces were landing at 
the same northeastern saudi base 
the pentagon has committed 50000 ground troops but the number 
could skyrocket if iraq invades with forces massed on the 
kuwaitsaudi border 
egypt and morocco were each expected to provide 5000 troops 
according to diplomatic sources who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity they were under the flag of their respective countries 
cairo radio called them an arab umbrella to safeguard the 
region 
the troop deployment set off demonstrations saturday in yemen 
libya jordan and the israelioccupied west bank thousands of 
people rallied in front of the the american saudi arabian and 
egyptian embassies in the yemeni capital sana in support of 
saddam 
in the west bank hundreds of palestinians also marched in 
support of iraq shouting we are with you saddam arab 
reporters said 
no other us allies have committed ground forces but a naval 
aramada is muscling up in an effort to force iraq out of kuwait 
the united states already has nine ships in the persian gulf 
seven in the mediterranean and three aircraft carriers and their 
battlegroups in the red sea and indian ocean 
britain committed two fighter aircraft squadrons antiaircraft 
missiles and other air and sea forces totaling more than 1000 men 
to the gulf area australia canada and west germany promised 
ships denmark said it would make ships available and spain was 
considering sending a frigate 
france and the soviet union sent ships to the gulf independent 
of the multinational force 
pressure also came from countries bordering iraq 
turkey moved f16 fighter jets and other warplanes near its 
border with iraq turkish newspapers reported and the 
semiofficial anatolia news agency said iraq had moved 
antiaircraft weaponry into place on its side of the frontier 
syrias staterun radio praised arab leaders decision to send 
troops to saudi arabia to defend it from possible iraqi attack 
calling it an achievement that reflects a determined arab stand 
toward one of the most dangerous crises ever faced by the arab 
world 
syria has feuded with iraq for a decade and supported iran in 
the eightyear iraniraq war 
meanwhile irans staterun radio said tehran was willing to 
cooperate with other persian gulf states to seek a peaceful end to 
iraqi aggression and urged a regional solution that would exclude 
the united states 
iran is prepared for any kind of cooperation with the 
countries of the region which may restore peace and tranquility and 
prevent the presence and influence of the superpowers in the 
persian gulf the radio said 
iran was the first producer in the region to make up for the 
shortfall of oil caused by the boycott of iraq iran has sold 
millions of barrels of oil from storage tanks according to the new 
york times 
iraqs oil spigot has been cut off by an international embargo 
according to oil sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity

marines and army air assault troops began 
deploying to saudi arabia on saturday to join a rapidly swelling 
us military force that is preparing to defend the desert kingdom 
from a possible iraqi attack officials said 
also pentagon sources disclosed that patriot surfacetoair 
missiles and other sophisticated air defense hardware were being 
sent to saudi arabia on the assumption that in the event of an 
iraqi attack an initial air battle could be decisive 
the sources speaking on condition they not be identified said 
patriot highaltitude missiles have never before been deployed in a 
military contingency such as the mobilization that has been under 
way in saudi arabia since wednesday 
in addition to the computerguided patriots the united states 
is sending hawk mediumrange guided missiles chaparral mobile 
heatseeking missiles and stinger shoulderheld antiaircraft 
missiles army sources said us stinger missiles already have 
arrived there the sources said 
the army also is rushing over apache attack helicopters and 
other weapons capable of knocking out iraqi tanks an army source 
said tanks would lead any iraqi thrust into saudi arabia 
were cramming apaches over there as fast as we can the 
source said 
the us operation is codenamed desert shield 
the pentagon declined to comment on a number of reports that the 
aircraft carrier uss kennedy would be sent to the mideast from 
norfolk va where it is currently being supplied for a new duty 
cruise a navy source said deployment to the mideast could not be 
ruled out but that it would be going too far at this point to say 
that such a deployment is likely 
the pentagon officially announced that elements of the 1st 
marine expeditionary force at camp pendleton calif and the 
armys 101st airborne division at fort campbell ky began moving 
to embarkation points for the trip to saudi arabia 
the marine force includes elements of the 7th marine 
expeditionary brigade the 3rd marine aircraft wing the 1st marine 
division and the 1st force service support group said lt col ron 
stokes a marine corps spokesman he said a marine expeditionary 
force usually totals 30000 to 60000 men 
col miguel monteverde a pentagon spokesman said no 
information would be provided on the numbers of troops deploying 
from camp pendleton or fort campbell 
about 40000 marines are stationed at camp pendleton 70 miles 
south of los angeles 
an army source said troops from fort hood texas also were to 
be deployed he gave no details news reports in texas said 1000 
soldiers had been readied for deployment and that five batteries 
from the 11th air defense artillery brigade at fort bliss texas 
have been ordered to prepare for departure to the gulf 
the 101st airborne with 15400 troops has two attack 
battalions equipped with 18 ah64 apache ground attack helicopters 
and 18 ah1 cobra antitank helicopters it also has two assault 
helicopter battalions a mediumlift helicopter battalion and an 
air cavalry squadron with reconnaissance helicopters 
the pentagon citing security concerns has refused to say how 
many soldiers airmen and other ground forces have arrived in saudi 
arabia or where they are setting up their defensive positions 
sources have said contingency plans call for deploying as many as 
250000 ground troops if iraq were to attack 
an army strategist speaking on condition he not be identified 
said pentagon planners already had determined that if iraqi 
president saddam hussein were to send his army into saudi arabia he 
would be limited to two main avenues 
the most likely path for iraqi tanks would be the coastal plain 
in eastern saudi arabia in that region along the persian gulf 
coast lie saudi arabias main oil fields and the heart of its oil 
processing and transportation system saudi arabias oil reserves 
estimated at 255 billion barrels are the largest in the world and 
the kingdom is the united statess main foreign supplier of oil 
the other possible avenue for an iraqi attack from kuwait where 
an estimated 200000 iraqi troops are massed is through a crossing 
near where the northern saudi border meets the juncture of the 
kuwaiti and iraqi borders the source said 
president bush said friday there is no indication of an imminent 
iraqi invasion of saudi arabia 
army planners figure that if iraq attacked the us air force 
would move first to establish air superiority an unknown number of 
f16 fighting falcon planes began arriving in saudi arabia on 
friday and the pentagon announced saturday that f16s were 
continuing to arrive from shaw air force base sc 
the pentagon also said an unspecified number of c130 transport 
aircraft were continuing to arrive in saudi arabia from pope air 
force base nc 
an air battle also would require strong us air defenses to 
counter the iraqi air force which gained extensive experience 
during the eightyear iraniraq war 
the pentagon announced on friday that elements of the 24th 
mechanized infantry division based at fort stewart ga moved to 
the port of savannah for loading aboard a troopship the capella 
for the trip to saudi arabia it also said two hospital ships were 
being prepared for active duty in the gulf area 
other us forces in the gulf include at least 48 f15 fighters 
and more than 35 naval vessels including nine ships in the gulf 
two aircraft carrier battle groups in the arabian sea or indian 
ocean and one carrier in the red sea

in men at work the brothers play a couple of garbagemen who 
find a body in the trash and become involved in a plot of murder 
and environmental poisoning estevez traces the films beginnings 
to a sleepless night at his santa monica apartment in 1984 hearing 
the trash truck outside his window he started devising a script 
the project stagnated at a studio for a year until estevez could 
rescue the script fifteen drafts later he made the deal with 
epic the budget was definitely not in the die hard 2 category 
we made it for what is considered by the studios a lowbudget 
standard estevez said 
how low about half of the industry average of 18 to 20 
million 
such a budget doesnt allow for charlie sheens 1 millionplus 
salary he dodged the issue i dont like to discuss cash but 
they were very generous 
four years ago estevez wrote directed and starred in 
wisdom becoming the youngest to perform all three functions in 
a major film it failed to find an audience 
if i learned anything on the first picture it was to really 
open myself up to include everybody in a community effort he 
said if charlie has an idea or if the craftsservice guy has an 
idea they both come from a place of wanting to make the movie 
better i didnt approach it that i was paranoid and they wanted to 
take my movie away from me 
oh hed listen to me if it was a good idea added sheen 
i came up with some stinkers now and then and they didnt make 
the movie they all cant be winners 
did the brothers work well together 
absolutely assured estevez you get there on the set and 
theres 100 people they all have a job to do you have a job to 
do 
you had three jobs to do said sheen 
right said estevez there really wasnt time for any 
shenanigans 
that doesnt mean we didnt have a good time making this 
thing his brother said 
we had a lot of laughs its tough though making a film my 
days were running 1819hours a director maybe gets four or five 
hours sleep 
about navy seals sheen commented a long shoot 16 weeks 
eight in virginia beach the remaining eight in spain very 
physical picture very dangerous picture but a lot of time i had 
a great time playing that role i got to create some situations as 
opposed to just reacting to them 
he also appeared in young guns but missed the sequel 
we left charlie back at blazers mill where the historical 
figure was killed so he didnt follow us estevez said 
i had no concern about doing this sequel i felt the second 
half of the billy the kid story had been left blank and i wanted 
to fill it in its a great character for an actor to play 
also charlies got a pretty good body count in the films hes 
done i had to catch up hes got 32 and now im up to 16 or 17 
confirmed kills so im working on it

rock n roll never a prime concern of the french 
government is getting a boost through frances new junior minister 
of rock 
monsieur rock as hes been dubbed is 27yearold bruno 
lion a jeanclad dynamo with degrees in law and political science 
his official title at the culture ministry is charge de 
mission for rock and pop music but he doesnt object when the 
title is translated as junior minister he was picked last year by 
culture minister jack lang to revitalize a domain long dominated by 
foreign talent or homegrown copycats 
his appointment came at a time when french rock and pop were 
beginning to outgrow their reputation as mediocre 
secondgeneration immigrants from postcolonial france a 
patchwork of ethnic groups from africa and the west indies are 
musically coming of age venting their rage and fears in tough 
sounds as diverse as their backgrounds 
in recent years paris has emerged as a capital of world 
music catchy ethnic rhythms sung in french arabic spanish 
and caribbean dialects and updated with stateofthe art technology 
by talented innovative performers 
among the rising rockers are mano negra who blends salsa 
hiphop gospel punk and reggae les negresses vertes the green 
negresses eight white men dressed in suits singing a blend of 
exotic melodies puns and edith piafstyle passion and les garcons 
bouchers the apprentice butchers who wield meat cleavers and 
spit wine 
however lions appointment met with ridicule and even outrage 
from some critics who believe rock by definition ceases to be 
rock once pulled into the mainstream 
any country that needs a minister for rock is not a rock 
country said lionel rotcage editor of the french edition of 
rolling stone he should resign that would be the rock thing 
to do 
lion the son of a prominent businessman has persevered 
chasing down financial and media support with a 1990 budget of 
78 million he expects to set up a solid support structure for 
musicians and industry professionals including direct subsidies to 
artists 
his tasks also involve promoting native talent at home and 
abroad no easy matter given frances dearth of concert space and 
poor reputation as an inspiration for rock 
france is underequipped compared to its neighbors when i took 
the job we had as many concert halls as there are in greater 
london or in holland and were 12 times bigger lion said in an 
interview 
his priority is getting groups out of suburban basements or 
subway stations and onto the stages of concert halls and clubs 
since he took office in may 1989 the government has helped finance 
nearly 100 new auditoriums 
lions appointment was hardly a disinterested cultural gesture 
a little investment can go a long way lion said noting 
that the government yearly earns more than 180 million in taxes 
from record sales 
lion sees himself as something of a talent scout he said he 
works 14hour days lobbying for formation of a major allfrench 
record company financing music videos and trying to get rock into 
high schools one of his goals is to internationally launch french 
groups 
at the recent new music seminar in new york about 250 french 
musicians performed as opposed to only 10 in 1988 and 196 in 1989 
according to lion a followup measure includes the opening of a 
french music office in new york next fall 
lion however is concerned about the new us immigration 
requirements for artists seeking temporary work permits lang and 
other west european culture ministers have protested the measures 
which virtually exclude all but a handful of foreign performers who 
can prove financial success and artistic worth 
the american laws discriminate against foreign artists lion 
said look at zouk machine no 1 on top 50 charts here for three 
straight weeks they are still waiting for their visa 
lion said the european economic community may be forced to 
retaliate to make its point looking ahead to 1993 were talking 
about a european export market of 340 million people he said 
lion who usually wears a black polo shirt jeans and an 
expensive leather jacket was weaned on the beatles and took up the 
saxophone and bass which i massacred before turning to 
management and production 
in 1986 he set up the french rock council and published the 
first definitive rock catalog for music professionals which is 
updated yearly

eight months after the government 
raised hopes for better television by selling two channels the 
private tubes carry the same diet of game shows tired comedy 
sensational news and reruns 
they promised us cultural programs and they deceived us 
said raul paladino a high school math teacher the news programs 
arent very informative and shows that are supposed to be funny 
give me a headache dora schmidt a housewife said both private 
channels seem to have the same formula soap operas bloody 
stories conflicts between neighbors assaults rapes and all sorts 
of low blows 
carlos montero who has produced hit shows for three decades 
said the station staffs have ideas but no money and programming 
might improve when the economy does 
television is like a dragon he said when its healthy 
it breathes fire and converts everything to gold when its 
asthmatic in crisis it begins to wheeze and turn everything to 
ashes 
channels 11 and 13 were sold in december leaving only channel 7 
in government hands the two other channels also are privately 
owned 
staterun television offers performances from around the world 
of opera ballet and classical music and movies from spain the 
united states france and other countries 
it carries top sports events especially those with argentine 
competitors and fewer but not better variety shows than the 
private channels programs of news and commentary sometimes are 
dull but are not sensational 
the two channels were the first state enterprises transferred to 
private investors by president carlos menems administration which 
is committed to divesting the telephone company state airline 
railroads and virtually any other public entity that can be sold or 
leased 
menem says privatization means new investment technology 
enterprise creativity and many other good things what has 
happened at the two tv channels indicates the rewards may be slow 
in coming 
editorial atlantida argentinas largest magazine publishing 
company bought channel 11 for 82 million company president 
pedro simoncini said the station had debts of 27 million and 
obsolete equipment that must be replaced 
artear owner of the masscirculation newspaper clarin bought 
channel 13 for 56 million jose demaria the program director 
said 8 million more must be spent on new equipment alone 
each channel has cut its staff to about 250 people the 
approximate level of the private station channel 9 that regularly 
leads in ratings and profit 
executives at both of the new private channels say they are 
losing money and attribute most of the losses to a recession that 
has cut advertising revenue forcing stations to broadcast only 
about 12 hours a day resources for new programs are scarce 
the lineups on all private channels are about the same 
soccer matches are a mainstay along with international sports 
events involving argentine stars gabriela sabatini in tennis for 
instance boxer martin coggi and daniel scioli in motorboat racing 
series imports from the united states are big miami vice 
and platoon placed in the top five recently 
locally produced variety shows feature arm wrestling scantily 
clad women men wearing dresses and makeup tango singers and 
comedy skits with suggestive punch lines 
in one popular show women stand in a transparent booth and grab 
money blown about by a fan that also lifts their skirts 
news programs tend to be sensational bloody crimes political 
scandals fires accidents personal tragedies political satire 
and interviews as likely to be dull as incisive 
satirist tato bores pretends to call president menem on the 
telephone and viewers hear a onesided conversations in the late 
1960s bores made the same calls to gen juan carlos ongania who 
was president at the time 
shows for children are short on ideas and repetitive the 
magazine noticias said recently usmade cartoons are shown so 
often that children know the endings in advance 
osvaldo alvarez guerrero a national legislator with the 
opposition radical civic union said simply the level of 
programing is pitiful

when vice president dan quayle was in 
lima the other day you could exchange 3 for about a million 
peruvian intis and inflation was getting worse 
in bogota the new president of colombia said in his inaugural 
address that his nations economy had been irreparably damaged by 
the drop in coffee prices that followed us withdrawal from an 
international price agreement 
bolivian leaders werent ready to complete the drug extradition 
treaty the vice president hoped to see concluded it will have to 
wait at least until the government completes a similar pact with 
another country perhaps spain to avoid the appearance of catering 
to washington 
those nations all are in the fight against drugs but they have 
their own problems and sometimes their own priorities in the 
three capitals quayle talked about cooperation for economic 
development and against drugs with presidents who pledged support 
to the drive against narcotics with varying degrees of dedication 
while putting their emphasis on trade and assistance 
thats the view of the usurged cocaine war from the andean 
nations looking north along the route quayle followed on a speedy 
tuesdaytothursday mission last week 
colombias newly inaugurated president cesar gaviria pledged to 
continue the cocainecombatting policy of his predecessor but 
pointedly reminded his inaugural audience that the andean producing 
nations cant choke off narcotics unless the industrial countries 
where drugs are used curb the illegal appetite 
in different words that was repeated as quayle conferred with 
the leaders of peru and bolivia where some suspect the united 
states is trying to load the whole problem onto the producers 
because it cannot control its users 
quayle said the united states is as determined to deal with its 
own drug lords and users as with the producers calling them 
complementary efforts 
but priorities dont necessarily mesh 
quayles journey was a followup to the feb 15 drug summit at 
cartagena colombia and at each stop he told of the 
administrations plans for freer trade and expanded development 
assistance for the andean nations 
but those pledges were general without the specific measures 
the three nations would like 
in peru for example where inflation has multiplied into 
hyperinflation and made the inti almost worthless the new 
president alberto fujimori met with quayle on wednesday hours 
before instituting austerity measures sharply increasing the cost 
of basic commodities 
his capital was in a state of emergency braced for rioting and 
the terrorist violence that has become commonplace i told him 
very clearly that the united states stands ready to help him with 
those challenges quayle said this is a time of opportunity 
for peru though a time of great troubles 
but he didnt say how the united states would help beyond the 
160 million in economic and military aid proposed for the next 
year much of it tied to the campaign against the coca the raw 
material for cocaine and a major source of dollars in the 
stricken peruvian economy 
there is 365 million in military assistance stalled in the 
pipeline awaiting a peruvian plan for action against cocaine 
growers and traffickers quayle and fujimori discussed it with no 
conclusion announced 
i do believe it is in his interest to accept the aid 
package quayle said 
appraising the andean strategy against cocaine the 
administrations office of national drug control policy said 
peruvians are more concerned about their economic crisis and the 
struggle with revolutionary guerrillas than about narcotics 
common sense says the same thing 
fallen coffee prices have cost the colombian economy more than 
500 million in export earnings in the year since the international 
coffee agreement came apart after us withdrawal in part because 
eastern bloc nations were getting their coffee at cut rates 
coffee is the major legal export lowered prices can only make 
illegal cocaine a more enticing business 
quayle said in bogota that the united states isnt opposed to 
reinstating the price pact but brazil has been the holdout he 
said coffee prices are going up anyway benefiting producers 
colombian traders also want lower us tariffs on cut flowers 
another major export they got one specific from the vice 
president quayle interceded to speed negotiation of a new trade 
agreement with talks to begin by the first week in september 
but quayle did not get approval for an extradition treaty to 
send bolivian narcotics suspects under us indictment to the 
united states for trial extradition has been one of colombias 
major steps against the drug cartel quayle said he hoped there 
would be a bolivian treaty soon and is confident the colombian 
extraditions will continue under the new president 
quayle called for partnership and cooperation 
the administrations drug policy office supplied a tougher 
message saying that continued us aid hinges on effective action 
against narcotics the drug office said the anticocaine efforts of 
the andean nations are being monitored and evaluated now to see 
whether they justify aid next year

early in heat wave a black teenager fresh 
in from the segregated alabama of 1960 stands on a hill overlooking 
los angeles his memories it was california the colorblind 
dream 
five years later the youngster bob richardson is a los 
angeles times messenger reluctantly made the times first black 
journalist to report on the citys bloody watts riots after white 
reporters were attacked there 
premiering tonight on ted turners tnt cable network heat 
wave is partly based on what scriptwriter michael lazlou says was 
richardsons true story sporadically told from richardsons point 
of view in voiceovers 
but its basically a mosaic of life back then in that black 
community one that dramatizes events leading up to the riots and 
the deadly nights of rage looting and burning that erupted there 
25 years ago this month 
it has a number of pluses including a superb cast the players 
include blair underwood as richardson james earl jones as the 
owner of a watts shoerepair business a man who urges patience 
and cicely tyson as richardsons grandmother who works as a maid 
for a beverly hills family 
youve got to give heat wave an a for its effort to portray 
the racial discrimination the lack of all but menial jobs for 
blacks the police harassment of blacks the anger and frustration 
that brews up and explodes on one sweltering summer night 
it also has a few wellshaded illustrations of the complexity of 
the watts riots particularly its version of a highway patrolmans 
arrest of a black teenager for suspected drunken driving an 
arrest that sparked the riot 
the white patrolman is anything but abusive the youths mother 
shows up and slaps her son for drinking but when the patrolman 
almost apologetically says he has to arrest the teenager the kid 
gets violent 
more cops are called they bust heads they get hit back the 
riot is on and in due course fearful whites in distant 
neighborhoods arm themselves including the man for whom tysons 
character works 
but the movie is an uneven effort partly because of lazlous 
propensity for clunky dialogue particularly in the crucial 
newsroom scenes which use real names of two staffers the times 
thencity editor bill thomas and reporter art berman 
when white reporters are beaten and chased from watts by angry 
blacks and the paper is faced with the prospect of only police 
handouts to rely on the editor played by david strathairn says 
damnit i need a negro reporter 
reluctantly agreeing to richardsons pleas to let him report 
from watts where richardson lives he subsequently gets an 
eyewitness account that the rookie purportedly has dictated from 
the scene his first time out 
pretty good huh asks berman adam arkin 
better than good says the editor who promply emits cliche 
101 used in most tv depictions of newspaper life run it as is 
it goes on the front page with richardsons byline and an 
editors note that says richardson a negro is an advertising 
messenger for the times 
although filled with selfdoubt when the father of his best 
friend calls him an uncle tom bastard and his best friend also 
berates him for his report the wise knowing businessman jones 
plays urges richardson to continue 
look into your heart and tell the truth the older man says 
not the white mans truth not the black mans truth theres 
only one truth 
noble sentiments unfortunately he is so noble you may suspect 
he is doomed likewise a decent young white cop harold pruett who 
befriends richardson 
its a little maddening this telegraphing of punches as is 
director kevin hooks terrible staging of a scene in which one 
epitome of decency is shot down by california national guardsmen 
that scene just doesnt ring true a pity since hooks direction 
elsewhere is usually effective 
summation heat wave is a good attempt that tries hard but 
given the excellence of the cast it could and should have been far 
better 
 
elsewhere in television 
primaries force new night for docudrama cbs says its madefor 
tv movie about last years muchpublicized stuart murder case in 
boston has been rescheduled to sept 25 the shows previous sept 
18 air date cbs apparently discovered a bit late would have 
conflicted with the massachusetts gubernational and senatorial 
primaries cbs commissioned the movie less than a week after 
charles stuart implicated in the shooting murder of his pregnant 
wife leaped to his death from a boston bridge the films unwieldy

two very american responses to a potential oil 
shortage have emerged from the iraqi threat one is to have 
somebody do something about it and the other is to do 
something about it oneself 
in the first instance elected officials are urged to take 
action against alleged price exploiters through the courts or 
legislative bodies the notion being that sellers should be forced 
to serve consumers 
the process hasnt worked well in the past if there are no 
profits to be made oil shippers wholesalers refiners 
distributors and sellers wont remain in business the flow will 
slow and the pump lines will grow 
in the other instance people examine their own situation and 
decide what action they can take they recognize that while high 
prices or a shortage will hurt them they can lessen the damage by 
conserving 
conservation worked in the past in the 1970s and the american 
economy and all those who contribute to it are better off it 
raised the quality of homes and automobiles not to mention the 
effect on the quality of the air we breathe 
it worked well for a decade more efficient and cleaner 
combustion engines were developed doubling the miles per gallon of 
automobiles more effective insulation materials were developed 
making homes snug with less fuel used 
the development of solar power cleanest of all was 
accelerated idle water power was put to use heat from machinery 
and electricity was reused rather than vented 
progress was made in the safe use of nuclear power and while 
environmental fears thwarted full usage and eventually stalled the 
program the advances that were made might be relied on again some 
day 
lives as well as gasoline were saved when the national speed 
limit was reduced to 55 miles an hour in spite of higher prices 
some people even reduced their bills by agreeing to car pool their 
way to work each day 
americans all but abandoned much of the conservation effort 
during the 1980s young innovative solar power companies went out 
of business utilities abandoned nuclear power plans the speed 
limit and thermostats went up 
but the effort has shown that individuals could find value in 
what appeared to be a total negative and some of those options are 
still available 
many people can drive less and more slowly and efficiently 
some can join car pools most can turn down thermostats and be 
healthier for it they can avoid paying prices that are out of line 
with those of other sellers 
in a business sense alternative energy sources still represent 
a privatesector investment opportunity for the government the 
latest crisis could provide an opportunity for measures reducing 
us dependency on imports 
experience shows that any economic crisis an have important and 
lasting benefits for individuals companies and governments 
recessions create conditions for expansions for example and fuel 
shortages lead to fuelsaving 
it suggests that initiative in the face of crisis might be more 
effective than complaining to elected officials some of whom might 
be more interested than the oil refiners and retailers in 
exploiting the situation

ive wrestled with reality for 35 years and im happy 
doctor i finally won out over it elwood p dowd 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
james stewart was talking the other day about 
one of his favorite costars a 6foot pooka named harvey 
whats a pooka its an oversized rabbit considered fictional 
by most folks but very much real to elwood p dowd in the 1950 
movie harvey the universal pictures comedy has been released 
for home video along with a sixminute introduction by stewart 
himself 
coming back in video i kind of like the idea he remarked 
in an interview at the beverly hills hotel people can see the 
whole picture with no interruptions for anything 
it seems that in the mail ive gotten for the past 10 years 
almost everybody speaks of harvey its one of their favorite 
pictures 
with henry koster as director the movie is all about elwood 
who is in his early 40s and shares a house with his older sister 
veta and niece myrtle mae he is the most considerate of men 
forever holding doors open and offering invitations for dinner a 
penchant for martinis his only vice 
why is he so happy according to elwood he was walking down the 
street one evening when he encountered a large white rabbit 
leaning against a lamppost and the two became instant soulmates 
elwood has no job a large inheritance took care of that and no 
sweetheart but always has a wonderful time thanks to the towering 
and invisible presence of his dear friend harvey 
harvey and i have things to do elwood says we sit in the 
bars have a drink or two play the juke box very soon the 
faces of the other people turn towards me and they smile they say 
we dont know your name mister but youre all right all right 
harvey and i warm ourselves in these golden moments 
stewart traced his history with harvey mary chases 
pulitzer prizewinning play with the gentle message of whos sane 
and whos not 
i got into it after the war quite by accident i went to new 
york to see the play frank fay had been playing elwood p dowd for 
quite a while 
during the intermission the producer brock pemberton came 
up and asked what i thought of the play i said i just think its 
the most wonderful thing ive seen in my life he said howd you 
like to play it i thought he was kidding but i said id love 
to in three weeks i was playing it 
after three years in the play fay wanted a vacation and 
stewart was delighted to substitute pemberton invited all the 
drama critics to cover the new dowd the result ive never 
gotten such bad reviews 
stewart returned for another fay vacation the following year 
again the critics were invited the reviews were even worse than 
what i got before he said 
undeterred stewart continued playing the role and years later 
when he was a better fit for the age of elwood p dowd he revived 
it in new york and london with helen hayes as dowds dismayed 
sister 
stewart discovered a regular pattern at the saturday matinees 
parents would bring their young children and inevitably in the 
first act one of them would call out wheres the rabbit 
that was always the biggest laugh in the play he said 
chase declared stewart her favorite to star in the movie version 
of harvey and a deal was struck however the actor had a 
certain reluctance 
i wasnt sure about the movie to me the whole idea is that 
you have to convince the audience that there is a rabbit up there 
with you and youre talking to him with the movie you have no 
audience you have a camera you have electricians you have 
another set next to you so it seemed different and i didnt know 
if it would work but the thing is strong enough so it did work 
the actor said 
elwood is among stewarts most popular roles 
in this world you must be oh so smart or oh so pleasant 
elwood says of his unflappable geniality and that sums up the 
sweet comedy even stewart has said his portrayal was too nice he 
brought out more haunting aspects of elwood in later appearances 
including a 1972 television production 
jimmy stewart at 82 no longer makes movies but he remains busy 
flying around the country to receive honors appear for worthy 
causes and to talk about his book jimmy stewarts poems the 
slender volume containing a total of four poems has sold 350000 
hardcover copies the paperback due later this year is expected 
to zoom over 1 million and stewart has now recorded an audio 
version 
johnny carson had a lot to do with it he said i recited 
the poems on his show and i had some encouragement from 
screenwriter leonard gershe he talked to some people in new 
york they said you just have four of them 
i love the idea when people say whens your new book of 
poems coming out it took me 20 years to write these four poems 
when i write another book ill be 102 years old so i think im 
going to leave the thing thisll be my book of poetry

i was always terrible at remembering lyrics and so id just 
shout hideho in place of some words when i saw how people 
reacted i just kept hidehoing cab calloway 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
dont bring up all that legend stuff with cab 
calloway 
hes not in the mood 
yeah hes been around how many years now well just say 60 if 
you need a number but thats not important 
whats important is the music its what keeps the 82yearold 
hideho king on the road and away from his home in white 
plains ny much of the year 
it doesnt matter what town hes in anymore just find a spot 
and a band and hell be there he was in europe in the spring hes 
been all over the united states this summer 
it doesnt mean anything to me its just part of the 
routine calloway said when asked if he was looking forward to 
two recent performances at the hollywood bowl if i wasnt here 
id just be someplace else this weekend 
sound harsh perhaps but after all the guy is a legend even if 
it bugs him to admit it one could tell by the awestruck looks on 
the faces of the musicians when he glided out on stage during 
rehearsal just like one of those old blackandwhite film clips 
from the 1930s 
one could see it again when he sang minnie the moocher when 
he held that last note on st james infirmary longer than a 
human being ought to be allowed to when he swayed and strutted 
around stage like some nimble tightrope walker 
those moves have slowed a bit since the 30s a time when 
calloway could have danced michael jackson or mick jagger into the 
ground and maybe the hair is white and thinner now the 
midsection thicker and that classically handsome face lined and 
puffy after eight decades of fullthrottle living but every bit of 
his voice is still there and every bit of the style and grace 
that made the legend 
so ask him who some of his own musical legends are 
nobody he answers tartly 
no really 
i dont know its been too long he finally offers as he 
does he peers off into space as if to recall those wonderful days 
when jazz was king those days of louis armstrong duke ellington 
dizzy gillespie lena horne and others he worked with them all 
no ill tell you who my heroes are he finally says 
wheeling around to face his interviewer my heroes are the notes 
man the music itself you understand what im saying i love the 
music the music is my hero 
indeed calloway who was born cabell calloway on christmas day 
in rochester ny gave up a law career for music his old lincoln 
university classmate thurgood marshall stayed in school and made 
quite a name for himself on the us supreme court 
yeah calloway says smiling at the memory i went to high 
school with him too hes a good old guy 
i was studying law and i got involved in music so i put the 
law career down for music 
any regrets 
nah but it wouldnt matter much now would it 
the music started in earnest sometime in the 20s when he 
became a parttime singer in baltimore and joined an allmale 
quartet in the revue plantation days 
really i dont remember calloway laughs when pressed for 
more specifics i dont want to remember its been too many 
years to want to remember 
but it was in 1930 he concedes that he hooked up with another 
legend harlems cotton club 
they wanted a band up there to follow duke ellington and they 
picked me he said 
he took the fabled old nightclub by storm soon there were not 
only concerts but hit movies such as stormy weather and 
international house and a string of broadway shows he also 
found time to get married and have children his daughter chris 
is a singer who has performed with her father in recent years 
and always there was the music one bigband aggregation of 
brilliant musicians after another each led by the dressedtokill 
dandy the wild leaping gyrating band leader with the 
unbelievable voice they cranked out such hits as the jumpin 
jive reefer man it aint necessarily so they created 
musical styles that everybody else copied 
they first did minnie the moocher in 1931 more than a 
halfcentury later people sing it all over the place even those 
who dont know they know it sing the chorus 
hidehidehideho 
i needed a theme song and i knew minnie would be a good 
one calloway says of the tune he wrote about the lowdown 
hootchie kootcher with the heart as big as a whale it really 
doesnt mean anything 
but it made him the king of hideho and brought him success 
that didnt slow until the 50s even after that there were more 
movies and plays but rock and other musical forms crowded aside 
the big bands 
then the blues brothers came along comedians dan aykroyd and 
john belushi took to the stage as cheapsuited sullenlooking 
ersatz rhythm and blues singers mimicking the music they loved 
when they put their act on the big screen as the blues brothers 
movie in 1980 calloway went with them he sang minnie the 
moocher and stole the show 
i think a lot of the young people knew me he says now 
they just didnt recognize me until the blues brothers movie 
now that they recognize him once again hes in no mood to slow 
down hell perform for the public he says whenever they want 
me

portauprince haiti ap ragged barefoot boys stop playing 
marbles and run to the rev jeanbertrand aristide when the priest 
arrives at his white twostory wooden home for street children 
they shout pe titid little priest a creole nickname for 
aristide 
he is thin about 5 feet 4 inches tall and appears almost 
fragile but many people believe the man behind those goldrimmed 
spectacles is one of the most powerful in haiti 
aristides strength is rooted in his ability to inflame the 
downtrodden masses who are the majority in this violent 
impoverished caribbean nation of 6 million 
many followers believe the 35yearold roman catholic priest is 
a prophet he has demonstrated the ability to stir the slums with 
fiery oratory and fill the streets with protesters 
he opposes the elections scheduled for nov 4 and speaks of a 
revolution by active nonviolence aristide advocates liberation 
theology which would involve the church in a political struggle 
for social justice 
in an interview he said the people will know when to come 
out protests are a weapon but like all weapons you have to know 
when to fire 
the salesian order expelled him in december 1988 as a 
protagonist of destabilization aristide remains a priest but 
is not allowed to conduct services or deliver sermons on the church 
radio 
i continue to proclaim the same truth without mass he said 
the most important thing for me is to serve people 
aristide said he opposes the elections because haiti has too 
many violent holdovers from the duvalier family dictatorship which 
ruled for three decades until a popular uprising drove jeanclaude 
duvalier into exile in february 1986 
haiti has had five governments in the violent years since 
we are in a struggle aristide said its a real war 
people with money and guns are killing people without money and 
guns we have to have justice first then elections today those 
with weapons will win elections 
in aristides view free and fair elections are not possible 
until the people behind major violence in haiti are caught and 
imprisoned 
his main interest is in those responsible for the 1987 election 
massacre when thugs backed by the army killed 34 people an 
assault on his church while he was saying mass by gunmen who killed 
13 parishioners wounded 70 and burned the building and the attack 
june 28 on the council of state during a meeting a council member 
and a union activist were killed 
the priest calls attention to the recent return from exile of 
roger lafontant and williams regala a retired army colonel both 
associated with the duvalier regime 
lafontant was a leader of the tonton macoutes the brutal 
personal militia of the duvaliers regala former minister of 
interior and defense has been accused of coordinating the 
electionday attack in november 1987 
aristide criticizes the united states for insisting on 
elections to which it has tied the resumption of aid washington 
canceled 70 million in assistance after the november 1987 massacre 
violence also is likely on the forthcoming election day 
aristide said and he does not think the presence of international 
observers will stop it 
if the american government sends observers they too will be 
criminals because after they leave the killing will continue 
he said why not help us get justice first 
jeanclaude roy a leader in a coalition of 12 political 
parties said the priest has a lot of weight and followers he is 
certainly somebody to have on your side he is a man who lives with 
the suffering of the people and is moved and touched by it 
georges fauriol a caribbean specialist with the center for 
strategic and international studies in washington said of 
aristide if he can mobilize people it is a worrisome prospect 
for elections 
aristide spent months in hiding after his expulsion from the 
salesians now he keeps a nonstop schedule 
he drives to peasant meetings in the countryside with an 
entourage of followers in portauprince he runs the home and 
farm for 140 homeless boys and meets with politicians and labor 
leaders 
during an interview in a classroom of the boys home called 
lafami celavi his eyes flashed with anger as he told stories of 
military persecution of the peasants 
little boys peered up a wooden staircase and giggled when they 
sew him talking to a stranger 
put on a clean shirt go go aristide admonished one of the 
scruffy youngsters 
he scoffs at rumors of presidential ambitions 
i would be a traitor to my people if i wanted power he 
said everybody who wants to be president is sick they have 
presidentitis 
aristide has escaped at least three attempts on his life the 
last was the raid on his church in september 1988 while he was 
saying mass 
he sleeps at different places as a precaution and said threats 
would not deter him 
i am not afraid for my life he said i am a haitian 
first a christian second and i cant be happy with my people 
unhappy

carlos lucero was given up for very dead in 
his race for the democratic nomination for us senate but hes 
alive again testimony to the resurrection potential of the savings 
and loan debacle 
lucero 49 an alamosa attorney has shrunk frontrunner josie 
heaths lead to a few percentage points with a relentless sampl 
assault that even includes his own band of investigators the 
untouchables 
heath 52 a former boulder county commissioner has responded 
with a series of calls for the government to seize the assets of 
sampl villains to pay for what she calls an outrageous ripoff 
were going to ask working men and women to bail out a decade 
of the politics of privilege and greed im unwilling to do that 
she said recently people are angry and they feel victimized 
theyre hopping mad everybodys talking about it 
the two face off in tuesdays primary but polls show that 
whoever wins will have a formidable job catching up with fiveterm 
us rep hank brown running unopposed on the gop side sen bill 
armstrong rcolo is retiring 
brown a personable man with a seat on the powerful taxwriting 
ways and means committee is a diehard opponent of new taxes and 
has a relatively moderate record on issues such as abortion and the 
environment 
he is already benefiting from white house support in the form of 
highprofile campaign visits from people like us trade 
representative carla hills and drugwar chief william bennett 
but browns ace in the hole is money 
as of june 30 the federal election commission said brown had 
raised just under 3 million heath had drawn 411000 and lucero 
brought in 182500 the candidates cash on hand was even more 
telling 139 million for brown 84000 for heath and 10000 for 
lucero 
in a gesture he could well afford brown recently turned over 
9000 to the federal agency in charge of cleaning up the thrift 
mess all the money hes ever received from sampl interests 
lucero contends brown has accomplished next to nothing in 
congress and is the favorite solely because he has raised so much 
money 
they checked his pockets and they jingle when he walks he 
said and that according to the smart money leaves me on the 
outside looking in very poor very dead 
lucero has astounded observers by remaining a viable candidate 
but heath has also been a surprising performer showing so much 
strength early on that former party chairman buie seawell was 
forced out of the contest 
if she wins the nomination shell be the fourth colorado woman 
to run for senate on a major party ticket since 1980 
the portents are not good republicans mary estill buchanan and 
martha ezzard lost in 1980 and 1986 while democrat nancy dick lost 
in 1984 after edging lucero in the primary 
but heath whose only political experience has been as a county 
commissioner is undaunted shes attracting national attention and 
support from womens groups with a prochoice abortion stance and 
an issueoriented campaign 
she has proposed cutting the defense budget by half over 10 
years and converting rocky flats nuclear weapons plant to a toxic 
waste research facility she has also called for some form of 
national health care 
in a new television ad heath says political experts told her 
all three ideas were risky well to me winning isnt worth it 
unless you can do whats right when you get there the candidate 
says 
lucero has lately depended almost exclusively on the sampl crisis 
particularly denvers failed silverado banking savings and loan 
to stoke voter indignation 
he has said colorado us attorney mike norton should remove 
himself from the silverado investigation because norton received a 
2000 contribution for an unsuccessful congressional race from a 
silverado figure 
he has called for a lifetime ban of neil bush from the banking 
industry because of bushs actions as a silverado director 
his untouchables team discovered myriad trust funds set up 
by ken good a former denver real estate investor who declared 
bankruptcy and defaulted on 32 million in silverado loans 
luceros summer sampl offensive has attracted attention so far but 
not money in the first 25 days of july he reportedly raised about 
11000 a fifth of the heath take and less than a tenth of what 
brown raised in the same period

a prolonged military conflict in the middle east 
will boost business for some us arms manufacturers but the 
defense industry probably still faces further retrenchment 
despite the deployment of american air sea and ground forces in 
the persian gulf region investment strategists who follow defense 
contractors mostly remain bearish 
paul h nisbet of prudentialbache securities inc however 
says the unfolding crisis could subtly alter the attitude in 
washington toward defense spending 
we feel that the chopping of the defense budget rather 
mindlessly as we would view it by the congress has probably been 
brought to an end he says there will be more concern about 
what they are chopping and less inclination to just hack away 
proponents of maintaining american military might immediately 
seized on the iraqi threat as an argument against gutting the 
pentagon budget 
iraq president saddam hussein has been portrayed as the new 
villian he has become a replacement for the soviet union which 
under the bush administration has been regarded as a kindler 
gentler superpower little like the menacing foe of the cold war 
era 
on the same day news broke that iraq had invaded its persian 
gulf neighbor the senate voted to leave intact president bushs 
1991 budget request for the b2 bomber 
in advocating preservation of funding for the stealth aircraft 
republican leader sen bob dole of kansas called iraqs invasion of 
kuwait a wakeup call against deep cuts in military spending 
such rhetoric will grow louder if the mideast turmoil 
intensifies already the situation has provided enough ammunition 
to make the job of defeating proposed defense cuts much easier 
the wall street selloff triggered by iraq flexing its military 
muscle didnt deal as harsh a blow to defense stocks as it did to 
other sectors defense stocks outperformed the overall market by 10 
percent to 15 percent analysts estimate 
prudentialbache upgraded its investment opinion of the 14 
stocks included in its defense group the groups rating was raised 
to a buy from a hold although ratings on individual companies 
didnt change nisbet said 
some of the stocks within the group that prubache has selected 
as buys are boeing co martin marietta corp mcdonnell douglas 
corp northrop corp and raytheon co 
general dynamics corp which recently announced plans to trim 
2000 jobs by the end of the year in consolidating two of its 
missilemaking operations is rated as a hold by prubache 
nisbet believes general dynamics would be a crucial stock to own 
in a time of war or prolonged conflict 
it represents a onestop shopping center for weapons and 
supplies everything from tanks and nuclear submarines to fighter 
aircraft for the navy and radio backpacks for the army he says 
general dynamics also is one of the cheapest defense stocks 
around selling at only four times next years projected earnings 
according to nisbet 
steven binder of bear stearns amp co says the mideast situation 
and subsequent oil price spiral will temporarily improve the 
relative performance of defense stocks 
an inflation flareup benefits arms manufacturers contracts 
typically include escalation clauses allowing higher costs to be 
recovered 
a few companies binder says could experience particular 
benefits over a longer time period raytheon which makes the 
patriot missile should find additional eager customers in israel 
and saudi arabia 
phil friedman first vice president for research at painewebber 
group inc says iraqs actions have helped speed an evolution in 
thinking about the types of weaponry that should be emphasized in 
planning defense outlays 
conventional arms that capitalize on fast response and lift 
capability the ability to move troops and equipment into remote 
areas have gained favor over the fancy strategic stuff in fashion 
until the big thaw in superpower relations 
but friedman doesnt foresee any windfall for the defense 
industry 
we dont think that youre going to see any material budget 
changes due to the middle east developments he says

how low have things been on wall street lately 
well more new york stock exchange issues reached new lows this 
week than in any time since the black monday crash of 1987 
last monday 370 big board stocks close at their lowest levels 
of the past 52 weeks in consolidated trading hurt by the economic 
uncertainty surrounding the iraqkuwait crisis by comparison 
1068 issues closed at new lows on black monday and 1173 stocks 
did so the following day 
to put it another way roughly one out of every six big board 
stocks touched on a new low last week 
thats a wound said william raftery an analyst at smith 
barney harris upham amp co discounting 1987 he said last weeks 
showing was the worst since the summer of 1981 the start of a bear 
market 
analysts are particularly concerned with the divergence between 
the dow jones industrial average which tracks the stocks of 30 of 
americas largest corporations and the broader market or 
everything else 
as the dow average flirted with the 3000 level last month the 
broader market was losing ground that move was exacerbated this 
past week after iraqs invasion of kuwait sparked fears that oil 
supplies would be jeopardized and the us economy badly hurt 
as long as most stocks hold to their trading range you could 
argue that the market was working out of a slump raftery said 
but once you start seeing so many stocks hitting new lows 
theyre probably going down for some good economic fundamental 
reasons 
which is precisely why many experts say now is not the time to 
buy many doubt the market has hit bottom and a number of major 
brokerages this past week recommended clients limit their stock 
exposure and shift more assets into cash 
when youre at a bottom you see the broad market start to 
churn a little bit start to lift a little said alfred e 
goldman a vice president at st louisbased ag edwards amp sons 
inc this hasnt yet happened 
according to a recent smith barney forecast there is a 20 
percent chance stocks are in a bear market right now up from just 
a 10 percent chance a few weeks ago 
events in the middle east aside plenty of problems still plague 
the market nothings changed raftery said the economys 
still weak the inflation rate is still questionable theres 
nothing to cheer about 
indeed a us chamber of commerce report issued last week irked 
bush administration officials by predicting that even without 
higher energy costs the economy is grinding to a standstill and 
will slip into a recession this fall 
what would have been a positive report on july wholesale prices 
which declined 01 percent rather than post increase as the 
market expected was dismissed by the govenments own caveat that 
the recent spike in oil prices would show up in the next assessment 
the bulk economic evidence points to a much more sluggish 
economy than anybody anticipated and hopes for soft landing have 
been thrown out window due to the middle east crisis goldman 
said 
with economic fundamentals such as they are corporate profits 
are likely to be pressured for some time and that will further 
weigh on the stock market 
at the close on friday dow joness average of 30 blue chips 
stood at 271658 down 9307 points from the week before 
the new york stock exchange composite index fell 467 to 18415 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market lost 
943 to 40803 and the american stock exchange market value index 
stood at 33932 off 731 
volume on the big board averaged 18129 million shares a day 
down from 20851 million the week before

americans are quickly learning that a remote 
country called iraq and its dictator saddam hussein are making them 
pay more to fill up the car buy a plane ticket turn on the air 
conditioner or borrow money 
the gravity of the us confrontation with iraq increased this 
past week economically as well as militarily 
oil prices jumped at the prospect of disrupted supplies from the 
persian gulf stocks and bonds weakened and business strategists 
scrambled to respin their forecasts for an already weak economy 
the crisis resurrected memories of the 1970s arab oil embargo 
reminded the country of its addiction to foreign energy and 
refocused attention on efforts to conserve and live modestly 
but for millions of ordinary consumers who watched fuel prices 
rise at an alarming rate within days the linkage with iraq was 
unclear at best and smacked of price gouging at worst many 
motorists cynical from previous oil shortages that produced record 
industry profits believed the crisis was fabricated 
here in questionandanswer form are some of the most 
fundamental economic questions arising from the middle east 
situation

iraqs occupation of neighboring kuwait and threat to saudi 
arabia provoked a usled boycott of oil from iraq and kuwait the 
possibility of a prolonged shutoff of oil from those two countries 
combined with the potential disruptions of shipments from the 
persian gulf region raised the specter of quickly depleted oil 
stockpiles around the world especially in the united states 
which imports 50 percent of its daily consumption of 84 million 
barrels this forced a rush of buyers into the oil markets hiking 
the price from 21 a barrel to more than 28 at midweek before 
settling back to the 2650 range

refined products like gasoline since they were produced from oil 
that was purchased relatively cheaply

<TEXT>
oil refiners contend they must pay the prevailing price at the 
time crude oil reaches them regardless of the price when it was 
pumped from the well therefore they must reflect the increase in 
their costs immediately moreover many oil companies say pressure 
for rising gasoline prices has been building for months partly 
because of increased summer demand even so the oil industry has 
shown some sensitivity to consumer anger over rising prices and 
several companies have frozen or rolled back gasoline prices 
slightly

by all accounts inflation will accelerate and erode consumer 
purchasing power at a time when few people can afford it many 
forecasters say the economy has already dipped dangerously near 
recession which ordinarily would mean the federal reserve would 
ease interest rates to stimulate economic growth but higher 
inflation could keep the fed from lowering rates and might even 
push rates higher already the cost of borrowed money has gone up 
making loans such as home mortgages more expensive

probably yes and that is bad news for the nations automakers 
which have leaned more toward selling gasguzzlers in recent years 
because gasoline has been plentiful and relatively cheap although 
most us cars burn much less gas than they did in the 1970s 
japanese models generally are more fuelefficient increasing 
prospects that their share of the us market could grow and 
further weaken the big threes business

airlines are especially feeling pinched by rising oil prices and 
many have increased ticket prices by as much as 10 percent fuel is 
one of the airlines biggest and most unpredictable expenses but 
airline analysts say passing the costs along to consumers is a 
risky move because many potential passengers could simply choose 
not to fly that will reduce airline revenue at a time when many 
already are hurting some analysts say the middle east crisis 
eventually could put some moneylosers such as eastern twa and pan 
am out of business 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
yes but that will take a long time an enormous rise in the 
number of vehicles on us highways has largely outrun advances in 
fuel efficiency which means the united states needs more imported 
oil than ever energy experts say alternative fuels such as 
cornderived ethanol fuel natural gas solar and nuclear power 
would ease this dependence but others predict that earnest 
conservation wouldnt begin unless shortages appear and prices 
double or triple
