moslem guerrillas fired more than a dozen 
grenades into an army observation post in south lebanon on monday 
wounding three soldiers police said 
also monday the genevabased international committee of the red 
cross said it sent four officials to lebanon to determine whether 
the organization should resume operations 
police said the guerrillas fired at least 15 rocketpropelled 
grenades at the hilltop position overlooking the christian towns of 
jezzine and roum 11 miles east of sidon 
an army spokesman said the predawn attack was the first by 
moslem guerrillas on a lebanese military position in the south the 
region used by palestinians and moslem fighters for assaults on 
israels buffer strip 
a police spokesman who cannot be named under standing 
regulations said the attackers belonged to the islamic coalition a 
small sunni moslem group based in sidon provincial capital of south 
lebanon 
the group is allied with the iranianbacked shiite moslem 
hezbollah or party of god 
fundamentalists have claimed the army post was manned by troops 
sympathetic to the israelibacked south lebanon army a mainly 
christian militia that patrols the security zone with the israelis 
moslem guerrillas frequently clash with the south lebanon army in 
their campaign to drive the israelis out of the border buffer zone 
all the soldiers wounded monday were christian the police 
spokesman said 
he said the army post was destroyed in the attack but the army 
spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity said it resumed 
communications shortly after the assault 
in geneva a spokesman of the international committee of the red 
cross said four officials of the group traveled to beirut on sunday 
to gather information for a decision on whether to resume operations 
the allswiss organization pulled out of lebanon a month ago 
after workers there received death threats four days before the

its been called the midwests silicon valley a 
region known for rustic woods and clear waters is also a breeding 
ground for the ultimate hightech machine the supercomputer the 
growing supercomputer industry in wisconsin and minnesota is the 
subject of the second story in a fourpart series the changing 
heartland that explores the new economic order in the midwest 
</TEXT>

this land of sparkling waters and 
towering trees was once home to brawny loggers who shaped a towns 
past now its a mecca for some of americas brainiest scientists 
plotting a path to the future 
this is americas dairyland proclaimed on every wisconsin 
license plate but cow country is swiftly developing into a 
supercomputer corridor where some of the fastest costliest and 
most mindboggling machines in the world are created 
with 50 million in incentives as a sweetener this exlumber 
mill town lured a different breed of builder supercomputer wizard 
steve chen whose young company hopes to construct a new machine 100 
times faster than any that exists target completion date the early 
1990s 
every state in the nation wanted this said michael schatz 
eau claires economic development specialist it definitely is a 
major coup this has just as much impact as an auto plant would 
have for kentucky or tennessee 
chens firm hasnt created many jobs yet and theres not even a 
guaranteed product but his locating here in 1987 further 
establishes the upper midwest as the nations supercomputer capital 
the region was already home to cray research inc and founder 
seymour cray the guru of supercomputers as well as the industrys 
second major us player eta systems inc a subsidiary of control 
data corp 
now joining them is chens supercomputer systems inc they are 
all within 100 miles of each other in northwestern wisconsin and 
southeastern minnesota 
they have followed a path laid down just after world war ii when 
several retired naval intelligence officers founded engineering 
research associates in st paul minn and built codecracking 
computers for the government era was later bought out by univac 
which years later spawned control data 
cray helped start control data then formed his own company in 
1972 
cray research headquartered in minneapolis has a major base 11 
miles from here in chippewa falls cray recently expanded to 
colorado but most of his workers are in the two midwestern states 
cray hired chen who left to start his own firm 16 months ago 
now these neighbor rivals are competing to create a machine faster 
than those that already do billions of calculations a second and 
help design cars forecast weather and aid in weapons research 
theyre both after the fastest gun in the west said peter 
patton a computer consultant in minnesota chens oiling up his 
holster 
having so much brainpower battling to build the worlds biggest 
and best supercomputer in so small a region lends new prominence to 
a part of america probably better known for breweries and bitter 
cold than breakthroughs 
this places minnesota and wisconsin on the international map 
said patton director of technology assessment at the super 
performance computing service of dataquest inc a 
marketingforecasting firm 
it adds prestige its sort of the difference between a 
chevrolet assembly plant in your area and a rolls royce plant 
he said they dont think of us as dairy and flour milling states 
any more 
some predict this industry will have a ripple effect attracting 
parts and supply businesses patton said hundreds of companies in 
the twin cities area such as honeywell and 3m are already involved 
in advanced technology 
some have grander visions the potential is here to develop 
these businesses and offshoots into a minisilicon valley said 
dick hansen president of the first wisconsin national bank of eau 
claire 
but there are big differences between silicon valley and chippewa 
valley 
in california the focus is on microprocessors materials for 
many everyday products 
supercomputers are more elite with only about 350 installed 
worldwide many in government and corporate offices and expensive 
costing 1025 million each patton said 
in terms of dollars this is a very small corner of the total 
computer market said tad pinkerton director of information 
technology at the university of wisconsinmadison even if you 
have 100 machines at 10 milion apiece thats not a lot of money 
some midwesterners also say they dont care to duplicate some 
things about the silicon valley particularly its explosive growth 
wisconsin has a very progressive social environment one which 
is going to move cautiously in things like building pinkerton 
said 
even chens company will grow slowly chen who formed a 
partnership with international business machines corp talks of 
taking four to five years to build his computer employment now 
about 100 isnt expected to reach 1000 until the late 1990s 
despite the wait eau claire population 58000 had few qualms 
about offering chen a 50 million package of grants and federally 
guaranteed loans even though it was 4 million more than the citys 
annual budget 
the city is lending 15 million of the 312 million loan 
package hansens bank is responsible for the rest the deal calls 
for a federal agency to guarantee 25 million in loans which 
havent been approved yet 
despite the risks schatz said this was the chance of a 
lifetime its the first time we seriously played with the big boys 
and went after a nationally known famous person 
eau claire and other cities began wooing chen when he left cray 
in september 1987 after the company canceled his supercomputer 
project saying his proposal was too risky and too costly 
he decided on eau claire in part to avoid moving the 40 cray 
workers hed attracted to his company chen has also opened a 
chinese restaurant in town 
his company has created an influx of new residents who schatz 
said are responsible for raising the average cost of a house to 
105000 up 20000 from 1987 
youre always looking for clean hightech industry schatz 
added they pay high wages it brings an intellect to your 
community with scientists and engineers its an environment people 
like to work in 
that wasnt always the image of this northwestern wisconsin town 
named for its clear waters in the 19th century eau claire was 
whitepine country home to logger barons with 20 sawmills on its 
river banks it was nicknamed sawdust city 
a century later in 1981 an almanac ranked eau claire no 1 in 
america for most taverns per person one for every 629 people 
schatz said being home to one of a handful of supercomputer 
companies in the world will give eau claire new visibility people 
around the nation he said will know who we are now

theyre superswift hightech superstars that can do anything 
from design nuclear warheads to build a better yacht 
supercomputers are used by the government the military 
universities and fortune 500 companies to help crack codes forecast 
weather design aircraft conduct geological exploration or simulate 
the effects of nuclear explosions 
the supercomputer is important economically and socially 
said peter patton a computer consultant in minnesota theyre 
used in everything from the mundane to the sublime designing 
appliances to developing new lifesaving techniques and 
surgery 
that range he said can help shape americas role in the world 
economy 
the whole name of the game is competitive advantage in the 
international market said patton director of technology 
assessment at the super performance computing service of dataquest 
inc a marketingforecasting firm the key to maintaining that 
competitive advantage is faster design reduced government 
certification time better testing 
the two major us supercomputer companies are cray research inc 
and eta systems inc a subsidiary of control data corp 
its competition three japanese computer giants fujitsu 
hitachi and nec 
there also are about three dozen smaller socalled 
minisupercomputer companies in the united states patton said 
some experts believe the japanese are threatening americas 
dominance of the industry we opened a very large lead and we no 
longer have that large lead patton said 
one of japans main advantages he said is it has the lions 
share of semiconductor computer chips market we gave up on the 
semiconductor industry 
but other experts say its too early to talk of the japanese 
overtaking the united states 
even though cray machines use a lot of japanese components i 
dont think its fair to say theyre ahead in any way shape or 
form said michael burwen president of palo alto management 
group a consulting firm 
there are a lot of people who say the japanese are a very big 
threat to supercomputers he said i dont think the evidence is 
in the japanese certainly have not been able to demonstrate they 
can penetrate anything outside their home market in this business 
about 350 supercomputers have been installed worldwide us 
customers include nasa the national cancer institute and los alamos 
national laboratory location of the first cray introduced in 1976 
supercomputers can do billions of calculations a second 
for example a bible concordance an alphabetical referencing by 
word that took a scholar 17 years to do in the mid1700s and 
required 1000 hours on a computer in 1956 can be done on a cray 
supercomputer in 20 seconds patton said 
although experts sometimes disagree on what a supercomputer is 
it generally is described as the fastest largest most expensive 
machine at any time one that can do problems others cant 
burwen also said 44 percent of all supercomputers are in private 
industry 37 percent in government installations and 19 percent in 
universities 
nowadays supercomputers are changing industry because products 
can not only be designed and prototyped on screen but be tested 
and evaluated and have complete data performance before you 
touch tool to steel he said 
automakers for one can do a design in six months instead of 
18 months he said you can literally take years off the design 
cycle 
supercomputers have also begun to simulate crash testing for 
autos 
and oil companies use supercomputers to get the best production 
in petroleum exploration 
if they get 1 percent more oil out of a reservoir it pays 
for itself 100 times over patton said what if its a 10 
million computer if you get 20 billion more oil out of a 
reservoir 
among crays customers are americas big three automakers 
volkswagen fiat and petroleum giants such as shell and chevron 
a cray supercomputer also was used to help design stars amp 
stripes the yacht dennis conner sailed in 1987 when he won the 
americas cup two competing syndicates also used cray technology 
said company spokesman john swenson 
scientists designing supercomputers are toiling in an industry 
constantly trying to produce faster machines 
cray plans to have a new supercomputer ready this year or next 
and its expected to be 100 times faster than his original machine 
in 199294 he hopes to produce the cray4 1000 times more 
powerful 
and swenson said that wont be the end as he explained we 
still dont see the limit

the french writer andre lautreamont once 
described surrealism as the chance encounter of an umbrella and 
typewriter on an operating table salvador dali defined the 
philosophical and artistic movement through his work and through his 
life which eventually became a surreal canvas 
from his dreams and from impulses that seeped from the dark side 
of the soul dali expressed his rage against the social order and 
impishly tweaked the bourgeoisie 
his death monday in his hometown of figueras spain at the age 
of 84 ended a life filled with eccentricities and a creative streak 
that touched the art world like a live grenade though few of the 
original surrealists who exchanged their revolutionary ideas in 
paris cafes in the late 1920s are still alive many in the world 
of art were quick to recognize his loss and his gift 
there was and will always be only one dali a man with 
intense saucer eyes and a mustache that traveled upward to form a 
bullseye with his cheeks 
more than any of his contemporaries dali painted through the 
minds eye pop artist peter max said monday by expanding the 
boundaries of time and space on canvas he changed the relationship 
between art and reality influencing every artist who followed him 
much of the surrealism in my early work grew out of my admiration 
for him 
kirk varnedoe director of painting and sculpture at the museum 
of modern art in new york called dali a unique figure in modern 
art 
dalis extraordinary theatrical instincts and the expansion of 
his career into various commercial realms redefined the conception 
of how a modern artist might engage himself with contemporary 
society varnedoe said for those who are concerned with the 
intermingling in modern art of the scandalous and the playful or of 
psychological revelation and gadfly irritation dali will always be 
an exemplary figure 
his images of watery timepieces melting flesh and disfigured 
appendages became symbols of irrational expression and insolence for 
a group of writers painters and philosophers who had set out to 
explode the social order they included the artists yves tanguy 
jean arp joan miro magritte and max ernst filmmaker luis bunuel 
and the writers andre breton and paul eluard 
the happy horse which dali painted around 1980 showed a 
hideous purple beast dali said it didnt matter whether it was a 
horse or a cow the animal was rotten and he once created a 
plaster lions head with a fried egg in its mouth 
sometime in the 1920s dali had a dream about a hand crawling 
with ants he told bunuel about the dream who had had his own 
encounter with the dark side of his soul he had dreamed about a 
razorlike cloud slicing the moon in half 
from the two dreams sprang the screenplay for the bunuel movie 
fantasy un chien andalou or an andalusian dog an 
irrational series of vignettes which opens with a razor cutting an 
eyeball 
dalis artistic genius had evolved from more than one plane he 
had journeyed from realism basket of bread to cubism 
harlequins to neoclassicism venus and cupid and when 
his thoughts turned to money instead of transforming life the 
surrealists excommunicated him 
during the spanish civil war in the late 30s when surrealism 
had surely reached it peak dali who supported the fascists 
developed a new appreciation for the renaissance and baroque which 
began showing in his work impression of africa philosophy 
illuminated with the outbreak of world war ii he became more 
classic and he took to painting portraits of women after the war 
his paintings had more religious themes 
everything in life leads to one idea dali said in an 
interview with the associated press in 1963 at first i was 
interested in psychoanalysis then in the theory of relativity and 
nuclear physics now i am obsessed with biology molecular 
structure cybernetics but everything science is connected 
by art 
scientific people believe in god and realize that matter is 
only energy material things disappear we live now in a crisis of 
mysticism everything is metaphysical we are in a new renaissance 
of religion and reunification of religions 
in 1949 he gave his first religious painting to the vatican 
dali disconcerted superficial minds because he hid truths with 
light and because he used the dialectic of analogy rather than that 
of identity said the artist georges mathieu in an interview in 
paris on monday dali is more important as a cosmic genius than as 
a painter 
still many recognized his value as an artist a reynolds morse 
a cleveland industrialist began collecting dalis work in 1955 and 
accumulated the largest collection in the world in 1982 morse 
founded the salvador dali museum in st petersburg fla it contains 
93 oils over 100 watercolors and drawings and over 1000 graphics 
as well as sculptures documents and photographs 
he is the greatest artist of the 20th century and he was our 
friend morse in a statement on monday before leaving for dalis 
funeral in spain 
throughout his life dali moved in a world of symbols whether 
canes crutches watches or animals at one time he gave art 
lectures clad in a diving suit he also once summed up his personal 
philosophy in two words galadeoxyribonucleic acid the first 
four letters formed the name of his wife gala the rest he said 
was dna the chemical of which genes are made to dali it was a 
symbol of immortality 
all my eccentricities are to prove that i am still alive and 
immortal he once said with me it has to be that death or 
life

president bush on monday called abortion our 
american tragedy as nearly 70000 protesters marked the 
anniversary of the supreme courts landmark decision legalizing 
abortion the march organizer said the new administration should 
provide actions to carry out their words 
bush speaking by telephone hookup to the activists said the 
supreme courts 1973 roe vs wade decision was wrong and should be 
overturned 
i wanted to share with you my deep personal concern about our 
american tragedy abortion on demand bush said over 
loudspeakers i think america needs a human life amendment and i 
think when it comes to abortion theres a better way the way of 
adoption the way of life 
the president said he was confident that more and more 
americans every year every day are hearing your message and 
taking it to heart i promise you that the president hears you now 
and stands with you in a cause that must be won 
the washington march was the focal point of what was intended to 
be a nationwide protest against the 1973 supreme court decision 
in dallas texas a crowd estimated at 3000 people rallied at 
city hall and march to a federal courthouse to protest the ruling 
meantime dr louis sullivan bushs choice for secretary of 
health and human services has been telling members of congress the 
1973 decision shouldnt be overturned according to the new york 
times 
the newspaper in its tuesday editions quoted unnamed sources as 
saying sullivan said the decision shouldnt be overturned sullivan 
causes a furor last month when he said he personally favored 
permitting a woman to choose to have an abortion but he later said 
he supported bushs position 
the washington crowd estimated by us park police at 67300 
assembled at noon in sunny mild weather on the ellipse with the 
white house as a backdrop as bush spoke at the start of the rally 
which came after a weekend of demonstrations around the nation the 
demonstrators cheered his words and waved signs 
but nellie gray of the march for life which organized the annual 
protest told the crowd bush could not hear their applause because 
the white house communications office had installed a oneway 
communications line she said she hoped that did not portend the 
nature of their future communications 
he spoke to us but he could not listen to us she said 
that was not an adequate way to deal with our prolife movement 
gray said that at a meeting earlier in the day with dan quayle 
she and other antiabortion leaders told the vice president we 
will not be talked to and not have him listen to us 
she said they told quayle and other administration officials that 
they need to provide actions to carry out their words 
sen jesse helms rnc echoed that call saying 
bush has repeatedly made his commitment to the unborn now is 
the time to produce 
quayle said he assured the group of the administrations support 
and told them he has been involved with people from his home state 
of indiana on the issue 
asked whether the bush administration could succeed in getting 
the roe vs wade decision reversed quayle replied 
time will tell we have the same commitment 
abortion opponents are hoping that the supreme court with reagan 
appointee anthony m kennedy on board may use a case from missouri 
to review the legal doctrines governing abortion and reverse the 
decision legalizing abortion kennedys views on abortion are not 
known 
attorney general dick thornburgh said sunday he hopes the court 
will use the missouri case to overturn roe vs wade 
the noontime rally and march to capitol hill have become an 
annual affair crowds at past commemorations on the ellipse have 
ranged from 5000 in a heavy snowstorm to 100000 or more 
police reported no violence monday but said about 75 
antiabortion protesters were arrested for blocking access to a 
washington doctors office where abortions are performed 
after the rally protesters marched from the ellipse to capitol 
hill some met with members of congress others gathered at the 
supreme court to chant prolife prolife prolife 
advocates of the right to abortion attacked bushs comments and 
warned about the consequences of restricting womens rights to 
abortion 
make no mistake about it president bush wants to drag american 
women back to a time when they risked mutilation humiliation and 
even death in order to take the most basic control of their own 
lives said kate michelman executive director of the national 
abortion rights action league 
douglas gould of the planned parenthood federation of america 
said bush appeared to be playing down the abortion issue noting 
that the president sent quayle to meet with the protest leaders 
instead of meeting with them himself 
for george bush to succeed in the future he has to mute the 
controversy over this issue gould said he is pushing 
tolerance 
but john c willke president of the national right to life 
committee said he had no problem meeting with the vice president 
and said he believes bush will probably walk in ronald reagans 
mocassins on this issue 
hours after relinquishing the presidency on friday reagan 
mentioned the battle to reverse roe vs wade as one of the 
unfinished items of business from his administration 
willke also called for a nonsectarian prayer crusade to help 
stop todays holocaust he gave no details saying individuals 
will have to work out what is comfortable for them 
all we can do is plant a seed and call for it he said but 
i see tens of thousands of pastors tens of thousands of points 
of light on a prayer crusade 
surgeon general c everett koop has estimated that 15 million 
abortions are performed every year in the united states

in a country where lovers of birds abound and 
sometimes travel all day to glimpse a rare one the 100th birthday 
of the royal society for the protection of birds is hardly a hohum 
affair 
witness the prime minister margaret thatcher she took time off 
this month to christen a new locomotive the avocet after the wading 
bird that is the royal societys symbol inaugurating an array of 
events centered on the feb 17 anniversary 
victorian gentlewomen founded the society in 1889 to combat the 
trade in bird feathers it now claims to be europes largest 
voluntary wildlife conservation group and second in the world only 
to the us national audubon society 
a century ago the slaughter of egrets to provide white plumes 
for hats threatened the bird with annihilation 
the trade was eventually stopped thanks to those women and 
their pledge not to wear bird feathers said chris harbard 
spokesman for the society killing birds for plumage is now 
totally outlawed in this country 
it was quite a feat he said because london was the center 
of a 10 million annual fashion trade in the feathers of such birds 
as egrets kingfishers swallows owls and birds of paradise from 
new guinea 
royal sponsorship was bestowed in 1904 the society now has about 
450000 adult members and 110000 juniors employs nearly 500 
people runs 114 nature reserves and handles the equivalent of 
nearly 25 million a year in subscriptions donations and legacies 
why so much interest because you can watch birds wherever you 
are even in the middle of london and not just pigeons and 
sparrows harbard said you can see kestrels hunting in the city 
financial district and great crested grebes catching fish on the 
river thames 
grebes prized for the gingery feathers around their faces were 
down to their last 42 pairs in the early 1900s harbard said they 
now number about 5000 pairs because of conservation measures 
britain has about 470 of the worlds 9000 bird species its 
commonest is the blackbird about 15 million and the rarest is the 
black redstart of which only 50 pairs remain the black redstart 
likes to breed at nuclear power stations 
bird protection in britain is centuries old but was introduced to 
save wildfowl for royal hunters a 1533 law protected their eggs and 
enforced seasonal restrictions on killing the birds 
among the societys first campaigns was a protest of trapping 
songbirds and of poletraps which fetter the feet of birds as they 
land on posts leaving them to starve 
from its headquarters in an old manor house in a woodland at 
sandy 44 miles north of london the society now runs such projects 
as treaining wardens in ghana and nigeria to protect birds that 
migrate from britain in winter 
it works against the shooting or trapping of migrants like 
nightingales warblers blackcaps and honey buzzards as they fly 
south over france greece italy spain cyprus and malta 
its an uphill battle harbard said conservation is a 
concept barely understood in some countries the bird protection 
society in italy has had its offices bombed 
he said the biggest problems are pollution and habitat loss as 
land is developed so the society sometimes buys land to save birds 
in 1959 it established the loch garten nature reserve to protect 
the first pair of ospreys to breed in britain for 50 years more 
than a million visitors have watched ospreys through binoculars as 
they snatch fish on the scottish loch and tend their young 
the whitetailed eagle extinct in britain since 1916 was 
reintroduced by the society from norway four years ago 
advice from the society on looking after birds includes a 
celebrated recipe for bird cake of nuts grated cheese seeds 
and household scraps combine one pound of the mixture with half a 
pound of melted lard or suet leave it to set then put it in a 
feeder 
more than 1000 events are planned for the centenary bird 
watchings boat trips to remote nesting sites films exhibitions 
concerts and childrens studies 
harbard says the society gets 15000 calls a year often to save 
birds soaked in oil spills 
we had one from a lady on the south coast who said she had an 
oiled bird he said we told her how to clean the oil off and 
then asked her what kind of seabird it was 
she said it wasnt a seabird her parakeet had fallen into the 
frying pan

a state investigator testified monday that 
jessica hahn told him she had a cocaine habit around the time she 
said she received 12000 in hush money from the ptl ministry 
the former long island church secretary said she used 7000 to 
buy cocaine sometime after getting two payments from the ptl 
ministry said richard friedman an investigator for the state 
attorney generals office he said he did not know if the ptl money 
went directly for the drugs 
friedman testified that hahn told him that one of her close 
friends wrote a letter to the ptl ministry asking for 100000 not 
to talk about an alleged rape by ptl television evangelist jim 
bakker news of bakkers 1980 sexual encounter with hahn led to his 
ouster from his lucrative ministry post 
she described what had happened and to me it sounded like 
extortion friedman said of hahns description of the letter 
apparently sent to ptl in 1985 
friedman testified monday in a hearing what evidence should be 
admitted for long island minister eugene profetas upcoming trial on 
tax evasion charges profeta also is accused of trying to persuade 
hahn his former church secretary to lie to a grand jury 
investigating charges against him 
hahn was at the albany county courthouse but did not testify 
monday 
she did tell me that she used cocaine friedman testified

at a news conference staged to persuade 
foreign journalists that burmas military junta is dealing 
magnanimously with the opposition a student leader suddenly 
challenged an army officer 
it is not true shouted myo win htun that students attacked 
troops in taunggyi during last years prodemocracy demonstrations 
as the officer claimed it was the army he asserted to applause 
from his colleagues that fired into crowds killing students in 
their early teens 
the outburst appeared to reflect what many burmese say is a 
defiant mood and a widespread smoldering hatred of burmas powerful 
military which had turned its guns on students buddhist monks and 
others agitating for an end to 26 years of authoritarian rule 
the deep rift in burmese society with its potential for renewed 
violence is but one of a host of problems facing this impoverished 
southeast asian nation now shunned by the international community 
the current situation is complex the future is bleak and 
uncertain said one burmese journalist 
the same military that crushed the uprising in september has 
promised general elections and allowed more than 180 political 
parties to register it has also attempted to woo the population by 
sweeping streets whitewashing pagodas and providing basic 
commodities to the poor at special stores 
many of burmas 38 million people have reacted to such moves with 
derision and are watching the power holders for signs of meaningful 
change 
if there are no elections we will demonstrate again student 
aung myint soe told reporters in the town of loikaw we have not 
given up the struggle for democracy 
such critical statements made in the presence of officials 
during a threeday visit by 46 foreign journalists this month would 
have been unthinkable prior to the upheaval 
possibly fearful of another revolt the military rulers are 
allowing more freedom of expression than in the days of retired 
strongman ne win 
although clearly designed to improve rangoons tarnished human 
rights image the visit by journalists was also unprecedented in a 
country that had virtually barred all foreign reporters and seemed 
to care about outside opinion 
we are moving towards an open society we need foreign 
businessmen investors and of course journalists must come said 
one official who accompanied the press trip 
however the new leaders stress that change must come slowly and 
view the brutal repression last year as the military elite 
exercising its rightful role in saving the country from 
unpatriotic and destructive elements 
every country controls mobs and if they refuse to act 
according to the law you shoot them said one senior military 
officer 
the government says 500 people were killed in septembers 
violence western diplomats put the death toll at double that amount 
four months after the sept 18 coup by gen saw maung a curfew 
remains in force along with a ban on public gatherings and tight 
control over mass media with the exception of nursery schools the 
countrys educational system has been closed for more than a year 
saw maung has spurned calls for dialogue by opposition party 
leaders and rejected one of their major platforms reconciliation 
with a dozen ethnic minority insurgents who have been battling the 
government for decades 
instead the rangoon military has mounted a major campaign 
against one of the strongest rebel groups the karen national union 
and is using up what little foreign currency it earns from the sale 
of teak and fish to buy guns and bullets 
the countrys longsuffering economy slid deeper into ruin last 
year as the international community outraged by human rights 
abuses cut off aid a number of western analysts say a further 
deterioration of living standards could reignite protest as surely 
as the negation of political freedoms 
an economic revival under current conditions is almost 
impossible the economy just manages to keep breathing said one 
knowledgeable burmese 
most major industrial enterprises remain closed and private 
foreign investors are reluctant to enter a politically volatile 
situation despite the recent reversal of the countrys closed door 
policies burma is currently unable to repay the interest on its 4 
billion foreign debt 
many burmese say they are putting their hope in the promised 
elections although there are serious questions about when they will 
be held whether they can be free and fair and whether the military 
would accept any victor who might threaten its power and privilege 
im not sure whether the government is sincere about holding 
elections said 26yearold student aung htu for 26 years the 
military has been on top i dont think they want to give up their 
status

a report prepared for the energy department says 
that a perishable gas needed to fuel nuclear weapons could be 
produced at twothirds the cost of the production method now backed 
by the department a newspaper reported 
an adequate supply of the gas tritium could be insured if the 
united states built the worlds most powerful linear accelerator for 
23 billion according to a story in monday editions of the new 
york times 
the energy department has told congress it plans to produce the 
gas by building new nuclear reactors for a cost of 68 billion the 
times said but the accelerator could be built by 1996 at least six 
years faster than the reactors the paper said 
the report cited by the times was completed this month by a team 
of physicists and engineers from two national laboratories in new 
york and new mexico and a nuclear weapons plant in the state of 
washington 
the report has not yet been submitted to the energy department 
the newspaper said 
the report says advances in technology have made it possible to 
use linear accelerators to produce tritium far more safely and at 
much lower cost than nuclear reactors the paper said 
tritium is used to boost the explosive power of thermonuclear 
warheads the united states has been unable to produce it since last 
spring when the last of three operable reactors at the savannah 
river plant near aiken sc was shut down for repairs 
the times quoted ronald w cochran acting director of the energy 
departments office of new production reactors as saying that the 
proposal for the accelerator is interesting and something we ought 
to know more about but its not a substitute for the currently 
planned reactors

a snails pace move is on to change the name of 
the us department of agriculture to something else possibly a 
name that suggests a broader federal involvement 
the idea is not new and usda or simply the agriculture 
department has survived in name at least 
but the national advisory council on rural development in its 
final act as the reagan administration gave way to president bush 
sent a report to the secretary of agriculture 
among other things the panel recommended that the secretary 
should become the spokesman for rural america as well as 
production agriculture the usda it said should have a rural 
development agenda as a primary objective 
to more accurately reflect the ongoing activity in the 
department the council recommends that the secretary support the 
expansion of the name of the department to us department of 
agriculture and rural affairs 
some years ago an illfated proposal was made to change the 
departments name to reflect its consumer role much to the 
consternation of some farm groups and members of congress 
but now there is a serious side for changing usdas name to 
embrace small cities and towns where the departments programs for 
years have been a part of local development efforts 
the des moines register in an editorial last year said usda has 
outlived its time and should be dismantled and given a different 
mission in todays world 
increasingly farm and rural are not one and the same 
the newspaper said having a good farm policy is not the same as 
having a rural policy 
rural america it said includes people who live in the 
countryside but do not farm for a living the rural scene includes 
14000 small towns main street and their businesses 
the usda began on may 15 1862 when president lincoln signed 
legislation creating at the seat of government of the united 
states a department of agriculture the first commissioner of 
agriculture was isaac newton who was sworn in on july 1 1862 
but it was 27 years before there was a secretary of agriculture 
heres why 
when the department was created in 1862 some supporters wanted 
usda to be established as an executive department with cabinet 
status but opponents said it should be operated as a bureau in 
another department a compromise was reached that led to creation of 
a separate department but with a commissioner in charge 
after some failures and six commissioners legislation was 
finally approved elevating usda to the cabinet level norman j 
colman the last commissioner became the first secretary of 
agriculture on feb 15 1889 
the name has remained unchanged since lincoln approved it 
a few early americans may have had broader horizons than farming 
on their minds 200 years ago even if about 90 percent of the us 
population lived on farms at the time 
in 1785 the philadelphia society for promoting agriculture was 
organized but that was the year also that a south carolina group 
for promoting agriculture and other rural concerns was formed 
while the south carolina example may be a slender reed in the 
agricultural wind it still suggests that some people in 1785 would 
have agreed with the des moines register editorial 
alisa harrison a washington representative of the national 
cattlemens association noted in an article last fall that the 1985 
farm law really tied a knot between environmental groups and 
farm policy by relating government price supports and other benefits 
to compliance with a wide range of conservation requirements 
as debate opens on a new farm bill to succeed expiring 1985 law 
environmental groups will be ready with proposals that will put 
them squarely into the farm policy arena she said 
if a usda name change is seriously taken up someone is bound to 
suggest the new name be us department of agriculture rural 
affairs consumers and environment try having usdarace stamped on 
your beef roast

a homeless shelter that had expected donations 
from an event featuring celebrity chefs instead got the chefs 
themselves preparing a dinner that included crab meat lamb and 
chocolatecovered macadamia nuts 
obviously we could use the money and were sorry that didnt 
work out said mitch snyder of the community for creative 
nonviolence which runs the 1400resident shelter at least 
people in our shelter are going to get one nice meal 
a commercial event had been scheduled for saturday night and 
sunday charging 50 per ticket for saturday night and 15 for a 
sunday super bowl party the forprofit organization planning it a 
taste of america had said it expected to donate 150000 to 
300000 from the profits to the homeless shelter 
the event was canceled late in the week because of lastminute 
contract problems with the hall where it was to have been held but 
the chefs were already in town and they decided since theyd come 
to help the homeless thats exactly what they would do 
the scene in the homeless shelters kitchen was chaotic 
the aprondraped chefs scurried around the alien kitchen 
checking the pantry surveying the equipment and the volunteer help 
this is how you slice the potatoes first you cut like this 
then this chef filippo milone of the pillars restaurant of 
mobile ala instructed the volunteers from the college of st 
benedict in st joseph minn 
and the carrots you peel like so he demonstrated whisking 
a knife edge along the side flipping the peel at a bemused college 
junior karla kohorst maybe youll be chefs its a beautiful 
business very elegant 
valerie hart a senior said if thats the way he wants me to 
peel them thats what ill do usually we just wash them and chop 
them but id never stand in the way of a gourmet meal 
milone then moved to the containers of crab meat dumped one on a 
stainless steel tabletop and showed three other volunteers how to 
finger through the meat to find hidden pieces of shell 
well we came here to learn things said freshman jenny 
langenfeld did i come here to learn how to finger through crab 
meat no she added with a laugh 
the chefs including john p hughes iii of windows on the water 
in kennebunkport maine john weichman of all seasons restaurant in 
mobile ala and daniel thiebaut of the mauna kea beach resort in 
kohala coast hawaii decided friday that theyd cook for the 
homeless on saturday 
the original purpose was not only to be part of a national 
historic event the bicentennial inauguration it was also to 
benefit the homeless said weichman when the original vehicle 
fell apart we felt we should go ahead 
hopefully theyll have a memorable meal and theyll realize 
they ate as well as some of the fat cats he said 
the menu decisions were as impromptu as the cooking lessons in 
part because some of the chefs had managed to cancel their shipments 
of expensive items 
for the original saturday night event hughes had planned to make 
his signature lobsterstuffed potatoes the dish ordered by 
president and mrs bush when they stop by his restaurant but he 
managed to stop the shipment of 160 pounds of lobster that would 
have cost 2000 
weichman had already brought more than 500 worth of crab meat 
with him and milone offered to split the cost 
thiebauts company donated lamb fruit and special colored 
chocolatecovered macadamia nuts 
compromises abounded and there was no apparent clash of egos as 
the chefs conferred on menu possibilities stirred each others 
sauces chopped vegetables and tried to keep the whole process 
moving 
in addition to the crab meat with a sauce of bell pepper onions 
mushrooms and pimentos they prepared a dish of roasted garlic 
potatoes pasta with a red sauce as well as a lamb dish and salad 
snyder said the change was good for the shelter residents 
we normally serve a very nice meal a hot meal with either 
fresh fruit salad or fresh green salad but we dont serve clams 
or crab people around here got all perky about that he said 
herman jackson 51 of washington appreciated the change of pace 
from typical shelter fare 
i think its a very good idea he said im thankful for 
everything we get

ronald reagan is now in a singular position to 
offer advice and help to president bush but if history is a guide 
he may not be called upon to do so very often 
bush has got to establish himself as americas leader says 
thomas e cronin professor of american institutions and leadership 
at colorado college and author of the american presidency 
hes going to have a major problem on his hands in starting to 
govern because people will compare him to reagan who remains very 
popular it will be almost a disincentive to call on reagan 
bush has not said to what extent he will rely on his predecessor 
his spokesman marlin fitzwater did not respond to an inquiry about 
the subject 
but if reagan plays any important role in decisions of the new 
president he will be the exception to the rule 
one comes away from even a cursory review of the lives of 
expresidents with a chilling sense of a wasted resource former 
deputy secretary of state warren christopher said in 1986 at 
dedication of the carter presidential library in atlanta 
on the whole their experience was undervalued and their advice 
too little sought christopher a los angeles attorney said 
christopher said one important reason was partisan zeal the 
reluctance of democratic presidents to appear dependent on 
republican predecessors and vice versa 
this does not however explain such things as reagans meager 
public contact with former republican presidents nixon and ford 
reagan did confer privately with nixon but cronin said in a 
telephone interview kept him at a distance reagan had good 
reason to avoid being linked publicly with the president forced to 
resign by the watergate scandal 
as for ford and carter said cronin reagan had no contact 
with them except for the time he sent all three living former 
presidents to represent the united states at the funeral of egyptian 
president anwar sadat 
some former presidents have been used more substantially 
franklin d roosevelt ignored his archrival herbert hoover but 
hoover coordinated postwar relief for president truman and both 
truman and eisenhower named him to commissions to streamline the 
government 
john f kennedy conferred with eisenhower at camp david after the 
debacle at the bay of pigs 
john quincy adams served 17 years in the house after leaving the 
presidency and william howard taft became chief justice 
on the whole however said christopher the former presidents 
and indeed the nation have groped uncertainly for a proper role 
now for the first time since 1861 there are four of them 
nixon ford carter and reagan like the other former presidents 
reagan gets an office allowance 
many americans would ask why do we let these four people 
wander around the country playing golf and pushing their books why 
arent they serving the public said cronin a lot of americans 
say we ought to be getting more out of them than we are getting 
but he added it is awkward for an incoming president to know 
how to use a former president 
reagan will be 80 in 1991 when bushs presidency is getting into 
full swing 
how do you use an 80yearold former president who lives 3000 
miles away the historian asked 
i would think bush would stop in and visit him once or twice 
when he is in california but would not do so until after six 
months spend an evening with ronald reagan updating him on what is 
going on and asking his general advice he said 
cronin said reagan might also be asked to help round up 
republican votes on some hardfought bush legislative initiative 
on the other hand he suggested former presidents may be the 
best judge of the limits of their usefulness 
i think they are all more sensitive than we are he said 
they have seen what former presidents have said that have possibly 
undercut them and they want to avoid that they must bite their 
lips a thousand times

between congress and the executive branch over foreign policy 
we can i think do a better job of having congress understand 
initiatives that we might take certainly in some difficult areas 
i need their advice i welcome it bush said saturday during his 
first oval office visit with reporters 
bush hastened to add however that while hed love to think 
that he could turn the clock back to the postworld war ii era of 
the late 1940s and 1950s when partisanship stopped at the waters 
edge he said he wasnt naive about the difficulty of coordinating 
policy 
in his eight years as president ronald reagan was constantly 
mired in battles with congress over such policies as aid to the 
nicaraguan rebels and sending warships to patrol the persian gulf 
not to mention disputes over the secret arms deals with iran 
the new president has invited the congressional leadership of 
both parties to a symbolic meeting at the white house on tuesday 
theyll discuss not only the budget deficit but foreign policy as 
well 
were contemplating how we best make clear to the hill my 
determination to try to reach for bipartisanship in foreign 
affairs bush told reporters the president has unique 
responsibilities under the constitution for foreign policy and for 
national security but we want through consultation to have 
congress in as much as possible on the takeoff

on his first visit to the oval office a 
ceremonial occasion mainly for the benefit of news photographers 
president bush could hardly contain himself 
its wonderful i cant wait to get to work it really feels 
wonderful he said with a grin and then launched into a 17minute 
press conference despite his vow to never take questions at a photo 
opportunity 
the hostages and the soviets were only two of the weighty 
subjects that came up and then there was the matter of the 
mysterious letter that former president reagan had left for his 
successor 
the note was handwritten on a pad with the inscription dont 
let the turkeys get you down 
wrote reagan to bush youll have moments when youll want to 
use this particular stationery well go to it 
before he read the note aloud bush had a moment of trepidation 
am i violating any rules here marlin he asked veteran white 
house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
theyre your rules sir said a reporter 
the new president quickly recovered oh i set the rules he 
said ok but weve established one thing havent we that this 
is not a photo op

hes probably gotten used to it by now 
but only minutes after he had taken his oath bush could perhaps 
be excused for failing to respond to his new title 
telling the story to congressional leaders friday at the luncheon 
they hosted in his honor bush said he his wife and the reagans had 
negotiated the capitols labyrinth of steps when the house 
sergeantatarms said mr president 
im standing there waiting for president reagan he recalled 
and i feel something that was between an affectionate hug and a 
kidney punch the silver fox telling me to get going

in case anyone was wondering the new white house team will never 
win any ballroom dancing awards 
bush ventured a few steps of oldfashioned fox trot at each 
inaugural ball friday night but only after apologizing for his 
technique 
you can say that you saw it first here a lousy dancer trying 
to dance his first dance with the first lady of the united states of 
america he told revelers at union station 
the bush family is going to give dancing a bad name he said 
later at the pension building 
and still later at the washington convention center i hope 
you dont judge my being a president by the way i dance 
there will be no relief from his understudy 
vice president dan quayle told reporters before stepping out that 
his wife marilyn says he is a terrible dancer and said he would 
keep it to a minimum that he did 
i guess protocol allows you to witness my inability to dance 
quayle said at one ball a few stiff turns with marilyn and he was

the postal service is resisting suggestions to 
sell some stamps at higherthannormal prices and donate the 
additional profit to charity 
some fundraisers think americans would be willing to pay the 
extra money and theyre asking the postal service to issue the 
special stamps 
postal officials however say the special stamps would be likely 
to cause them endless headaches elicit yawns from the general 
public and offend one of their most important groups of clients 
stamp collectors 
in question is a product known as semipostals stamps which 
have been used for charitable fund raising in other nations theyve 
worked in some countries flopped in others 
its an idea put forth regularly most recently in an october 
report from the institute for public policy and administration of 
the union for experimenting colleges and universities 
a special stamp might be sold for 35 cents for example with a 
quarter going to pay postage and the extra dime donated to charity 
purchasing the special stamps would be a voluntary contribution 
since regular stamps would also be available the college report 
said 
citing successful semipostal programs in germany and other 
nations the study estimated that as much as 70 million could be 
raised by these stamps in the united states 
there is every reason to believe that a semipostal program 
would be well enough received by the public and significant enough 
in its nonprofit funding benefits to justify at least trial 
implementation the report concluded 
but it also noted that the program would require the support of 
both congress and the postal service 
the general accounting office an arm of congress was 
considerably less optimistic when it studied the idea earlier this 
year projecting income at 12 million at best 
most countries that have conducted semipostal stamp programs 
have not been successful in generating significant surcharge 
revenues the gao found 
canada for example actively promoted sales of semipostal 
stamps to raise money for its olympic athletes despite the 
promotion and wide interest in the olympics the public declined to 
pay extra for the fundraising stamps the gao said 
the postal service opposes the idea for a variety of reasons 
including accounting problems and the potential damage to the 
lucrative collectors market said wl davidson jr director of the 
agencys office of stamps and philatelic marketing 
we think it would be virtually impossible to decide which 
charity to favor every year we dont know how we could fairly 
discriminate among them davidson said 
in addition he said the agency worries that stamp collectors 
would view semipostals as an unfair tax on their hobby 
since collectors generally purchase at least some examples of 
every stamp issued by the postal service they dont have the option 
of ignoring the higher priced semipostals as other buyers can 
for them it would be an involuntary contribution said 
davidson 
last year the postal service had a 170 million profit on sales 
of stamps to collectors a market the agency doesnt want to 
endanger by alienating the buyers

about 300 works by paul gauguin the french painter 
who rejected middle class comforts to pursue art in the polynesian 
wild fill the grand palais in frances largest retrospective of his 
work in 40 years 
gauguin running through april 24 is a 2million 
coproduction with the art institute of chicago and the washington 
national gallery of art which presented slightly different versions 
of the show last year 
the french have not had a comprehensive look at gauguin since 
1949 and they have embraced his works wholeheartedly the show has 
been billed as the blockbuster art event of the season drawing 
about 6000 visitors daily 
critics say the show is highlighted by 11 paintings on loan from 
the hermitage museum in leningrad and moscows pushkin museum which 
rarely leave the soviet union they include pastorales 
tahitiennes 1892 a brightly colored bucolic scene gauguin 
believed was his best tahitian effort 
with its flat surface exotic flowers and sensuous women in 
native dress the work sums up the essence of gauguin the distorted 
perspective and bold use of color which he once called a 
profound mysterious language a language of the dream would 
later influence works by pablo picasso henri matisse and other 20th 
century masters 
the show begins with gauguins early work paintings like 
effect of snow 1883 a wintry village scene reminiscent of 
claude monets the magpie 
in the early years working as a stockbroker and painting on 
weekends gauguin tried to master impressionist techniques later 
reacting against realism he opted for mystery and exoticism 
gauguin sought a primitive naturalness where ever he went and 
became dependent on it for stimulation 
in 1886 he left paris for pontaven in brittany where his eye 
focused on the elaborate headpieces worn by native women 
two years later he went to arles in southern france where he 
painted the same sunflowers and haystacks van gogh immortalized 
later during two different stays in the south pacific he would 
depict the tribal rituals and superstitions of true savages 
besides bringing together so many remarkable paintings executed 
after 1895 when he left france never to return the paris exhibition 
features two important works not displayed in washington or chicago 
in the vision after the sermon jacob wrestling with the 
angel 1888 gauguin experimented with pure color and reduced all 
forms to their outlines in papa moe 1893 he portrayed a 
native woman drinking water from a jungle source against a lush 
backround of tropical flora and fauna 
also on show is aita tamari vahine judith te parari 
189394 a bizarre portrait of a naked polynesian adolescent 
posing with an orange monkey anna the javanese as she was known 
was 13 years old when she became gauguins mistress and accompanied 
him back to france from the south pacific after his first stay there 
on a visit to brittany the flamboyantly dressed gauguin anna 
and her monkey were laughed at by sailors prompting the artist to 
pick a fight he sustained a broken foot and was bedridden for 
weeks anna left him returned to paris and robbed his studio of 
paintings and other valuables leaving him practically destitute 
the show ends on a optimistic note the monumental door frame 
sculpted in redwood and taken from the hut in the remote south 
pacific island of marquesas where gauguin died in misery and 
solitude in 1903 at the age of 55 
carved with flowers and nude native women it bears the 
inscription the house of pleasure and sums up gauguins life 
credo be in love and you will be happy

george bush advised president reagan at white 
house meetings in december 1985 and in the spring of 1986 to end 
american arms shipments to iran according to a published report 
quoting reagans former national security adviser 
the adviser robert c mcfarlane was quoted in mondays editions 
of the new york times as saying that although vice president bush 
rarely expressed an opinion at such meetings he supported mcfarlane 
in urging that the arms shipments be stopped 
i was struck that he had intervened mcfarlane told the 
times that seemed a little bit unusual to me and i was pleased 
that he had 
mcfarlane advised reagan to end the shipments because the 
operation was not fulfilling its original purpose of making 
contact with iranians able to change policy mcfarlane told the 
times 
the former adviser said that later in the meeting bush nodded 
and was kind of pensive and looked over toward the president and 
said i think buds probably right according to the times 
bud is mcfarlanes nickname 
bush has acknowledged that he knew of the arms sales to iran as 
part of attempts to gain freedom for american hostages but said he 
was unaware of the diversion of profits from the sales to nicaraguan 
contras 
his role in the irancontra affair has remained largely a 
mystery although he has insisted that he expressed certain 
reservations about the weapons shipment in private conversations 
with reagan 
bush who led a presidential task force on terrorism has tried 
to minimize his involvement in the iran arms sale he claimed he was 
out of the loop in making major policy decisions 
mcfarlanes statements are not supported by the reports of 
congressional investigators and others who have studied the 
irancontra affair including the diversion of the profits from the 
weapons sales to help the rebels in nicaragua other sources have 
indicated that bush was not even present at the december meeting 
described by mcfarlane the times said 
the reports offer no strong evidence to indicate that bush urged 
reagan to end the arms shipments 
mcfarlane who attempted suicide after his role in the 
irancontra affair became known is awaiting sentencing on his 
guilty plea to harges that he withheld information from congress 
about the shipments 
whatever bushs reservations the shipment of american weapons 
and spare parts to iran continued into the fall of 1986

serial killer ted bundy took responsibility 
sunday for two idaho murders and as many as eight in utah 
continuing tearful 11thhour confessions even though they failed to 
bring him an execution delay officials said 
utah authorities had suspected bundy in the deaths of two women 
and the disappearances of three others in 1974 and 1975 but in a 
1hour prison interview with a detective late sunday there was 
one incident where he mentioned eight sheriff pete hayward said 
in salt lake city 
bundy did elaborate on some of the cases and of course theyve 
all been taperecorded and documents marked hayward said well 
be looking at it very carefully to see if what he told us matches 
up 
hayward said his investigator described bundy as uncooperative at 
times and that he seemed very tired putting his face in his 
hands and acting as if he was going to sleep 
idaho state attorney general jim jones said his chief 
investigator met with bundy for about an hour and that the 
condemned prisoner described two murders he committed in idaho about 
1974 or 1975 
one seems to be fairly possible the other is tough to tell at 
this time jones said in boise after speaking to investigator russ 
reneau by phone 
bundy provided washington state and colorado investigators on 
friday and saturday with details of at least nine murders for which 
he has long been suspected but never charged by sunday however he 
became erratic in his promises as he met with attorneys a friend 
and paralegals 
bundy 42 who is scheduled to die at 7 am tuesday broke but 
rescheduled an appointment with the utah detective and canceled a 
monday afternoon news conference with 30 journalists officials said 
hes got visits scheduled with investigators from colorado 
utah and washington some of them tonight and some maybe tomorrow 
although we dont know about tomorrow le turner assistant 
superintendent at florida state prison said late sunday he may 
not have time for all of them 
bundy who has been on death row at the prison since july 1979 
lost an appeal to the us supreme court a week ago and no other 
court he has turned to since has offered a reprieve 
bundys next step could be an appeal to anthony kennedy the 
supreme court justice assigned to consider lastminute florida death 
appeals one justice may stay an execution pending review by the 
full court but kennedy favors the death penalty 
in talks with authorities over the weekend bundy who grew up in 
tacoma wash confessed to killing at least eight young women in 
that state in 1974 said investigator robert keppel of the 
washington attorney generals office 
bundy also confessed to the 1975 slaying of julie cunningham 26 
a vail colo ski shop employee whose body was never found said 
vail police chief ken hughey 
hughey said bundy is convinced that the only way he will get to 
heaven is to confess 
hes attempting to purge himself said colorado attorney 
general duane woodard it is part of his repenting 
the man is trying to save his life keppel told kirotv of 
seattle he added that bundy was shaken and tearful as he responded 
to questions from investigators 
bundy had not previously admitted to any slayings 
bundy scrapped his plan to hold a news conference apparently on 
the advice of his attorneys said richard shelton executive 
director of the florida press association which was coordinating 
the event 
last week bundy offered to trade information about other slayings 
for a delay in his execution but gov bob martinez who signed 
bundys fourth death warrant tuesday said he would not negotiate 
with a killer 
bundy is welcome to talk all he wants but he better say it by 
tuesday morning said john peck press secretary to martinez 
bundy scheduled to die for the 1978 kidnapmurder of 12yearold 
kimberly leach of lake city fla at one time was linked to as many 
as 36 killings and disappearances of young women in washington 
colorado utah and other western states he was being questioned 
about the deaths of at least 24 women 
the law school dropout was visited saturday by officials from 
washington state and colorado said paul decker assistant 
superintendent of florida state prison near this northcentral 
florida town where bundy is held 
bundys lawyers lost two more bids for a stay of execution 
saturday us district judge g kendall sharp refused to issue a 
stay and then a threejudge panel of the 11th us circuit court of 
appeals in atlanta denied bundys appeal 
diana weiner a sarasota attornovernor delay the execution 
i am not going to do it eikenberry said 
thomas leach whose 12yearold daughter was bundys last victim 
nevertheless doubted the execution would proceed saying they 
aint going to do nothing 
miss leach disappeared from lake city junior high on feb 9 
1978 her body was found april 7 1978 in a hog shed along the 
suwannee river 
i think its been dragged on for far far too many years 
said bob simmons assistant principal at the school 
bundy also has been sentenced to die for the murders of lisa 
levy 20 and margaret bowman 21 they were clubbed to death at a 
sorority house at florida state university in tallahassee 
hughey said bundy acknowledged killing ms cunningham who 
disappeared in vail in 1975 detectives believe the confession is 
indeed valid he said noting that bundys details about the 
victim her clothes and the vail area have been persuasive 
in talks with keppel bundy confessed to the eight ted 
murders in washington state witnesses had reported seeing a 
charming young stranger who called himself ted near where several 
victims disappeared 
for the parents of one victim central washington university 
student susan rancourt the confession helped write the final 
chapter to a tragedy 
its been an open wound for 15 years and every time we think 
its settling down something happens said miss rancourts 
mother vivian rancourt of laconner wash there will always be 
that loss that we cannot replace but at least we can put it all 
together 
keppel said bundy admitted to an additional washington state 
killing but the investigator was unable to say whether bundy was 
telling the truth or just trying to buy time keppel who earlier 
was quoted by kiro radio as saying three additional killings were 
discussed said bundy provided no further details 
keppel said bundy also confirmed the identity of one of the eight 
ted victims as georgann hawkins a university of washington 
student who disappeared from an alley behind her sorority house in 
1974 her remains had never been officially identified 
bundys mother louise bundy of tacoma told the morning news 
tribune of tacoma that the confessions were unexpected because we 
have staunchly believed and i guess we still do until we hear what 
he really said that he was not guilty of any of those crimes 
but if this is true if ted did do these things and if indeed 
he is substantiating it with facts that he really did those things 
its the most devastating news of our lives

by some accounts they were an organized 
gang of devilworshipers by others a looseknit band of young 
misfits gone astray when they attacked their parents battering one 
mother to death with a baseball bat 
the four teenagers called themselves wolverines and on a 
september night carried out or arranged the attacks on four of their 
parents in a scheme to run away from home authorities said 
rhonda macha 49 was killed police say her 15yearold son 
michael beaver repeatedly swung a baseball bat into her head 
the other adults survived gunshot wounds 
the crimes being committed by an adult would be terrible 
enough but when you think of it being a 15yearold and this being 
his own mother it just makes it that much worse said susan 
lowery an assistant fort bend county district attorney 
authorities say the youths planned to steal money weapons and a 
pickup truck and escape to a place where they could live off the 
land their destinations however suggest that the teenagers were 
more vicious than they were sophisticated prosecutors said 
they wanted to go to either canada louisiana or port lavaca 
ms lowery said noting that port lavaca is just 70 miles away from 
their homes in this community southwest of houston 
that tells you something about their thinking there are just a 
lot of things in this that dont make any sense on a normal level 
prosecutors say 16yearold iva candeleria was the ringleader and 
ordered the attacks including a shotgun assault on her parents 
its not like she took normal everyday kids and turned them 
into criminals says alan small an assistant district attorney 
they didnt come from good homes they all had a bad family 
situation to start off with and then they found each other and 
agreed to kill their parents 
until the case took a twist tuesday the three juveniles charged 
in the attacks had been certified to stand trial as adults 
miss candeleria and beaver now face new hearings because the 
psychologist who examined them was charged with misdemeanor perjury 
for allegedly lying about notes taken during the exams 
richard lankford 15 was certified as an adult after examination 
by another psychologist a grand jury was impaneled last week to 
consider charges against the boy who is accused of shooting his 
father in the arm with a shotgun 
the fourth youth eugene lewman 19 is charged with attempted 
murder in the shotgun attack allegedly ordered by miss candeleria 
against her parents 
all four are in custody as juveniles miss candeleria was 
charged with conspiracy to commit murder beaver murder and 
lankford attempted murder 
police reports suggest the group was involved in satanism 
although prosecutors question whether there were any serious ties to 
the occult 
one kid in the group was asked one time if he loved the devil 
and thats it as far as we know small said there was no 
apparent devil worshiping no meetings none of the animal 
sacrifices that are generally associated with satanism 
police estimate there were perhaps 10 members in the wolverines 
school officials say they have no indication of devil worship 
among the lamar consolidated districts 12000 students but 
nevertheless last november they advised staff to watch for gang and 
cult activity 
certainly this alarms people said superintendent ronald 
caloss you hear something like this and you just shake your head 
we dont want to want to underplay it but we havent found any sign 
of it 
beavers attorney harold kennedy scoffed at talk of the occult 
that whole thing has been blown totally out of proportion 
kennedy said 
attorneys for the three other teenagers did not return phone 
messages left by the associated press none of the parents could be 
contacted a telephone listing could not be found for miss 
candelerias parents there was no answer to repeated calls to the 
lankfords 
prosecutors say one of the strangest aspects of the case has been 
the unwillingness of the parents to cooperate even though they were 
the targets of the attacks 
when we had the detention hearings the parents wanted them 
home ms lowery said it came out in the detention hearing that 
the girl had even tried to poison her parents before and they knew 
about it she put rat poison in their coffee 
they were just misfits she said they didnt fit in 
anywhere and unfortunately they found each other

last month brockton became the first in the nation to obtain 
federal approval to do so 
addicts are given methadone to drink in liquid form in medically 
controlled doses it satisfies the bodys craving for an opiate but 
does not produce the sort of high brought by heroin 
the city is leasing the van for 700 a month a cost borne by the 
state 
addicts patronizing the van will be subjected to random urine 
tests to ensure they are not using illegal drugs they also will 
receive counseling 
city officials said that using a van will calm fears residents 
have when permanent clinics are in their neighborhoods it will 
allow clients to use the service nearer to where they live work or 
attend school and it should make methadone available to more people 
wanting it to get off heroin 
a year ago 242 people were receiving methadone from a city 
program set up in a trailer outside boston city hospital 
eventually the van is expected to assist 110 more people and leave 
a waiting list of about 15 people said neil sullivan a senior 
adviser to mayor raymond flynn

texas leading insect expert said 
he fears a media swarm and possible panic more than the arrival of 
the socalled killer bees in the united states next year 
i know im the guy theyre going to be calling said fowden 
maxwell head of the department of entomology at texas aampm 
university and chairman of the texas africanized honey bee advisory 
committee im going to be on the hot spot 
he predicted the bees will cross the rio grande and enter the 
united states from mexico by spring 1990 
but the insects though aggressive may be the victims of bad 
pressits an unfortunate label he said of the term killer 
bees 
we prefer africanized honey bee 
the annual death rate from bee stings in texas is 082 per 
million maxwell noted saying more people die from wasp stings or 
lightning strikes than from bees 
the first person that gets stung or child or old person that 
gets killed you know whats going to happen he said the 
public backlash 
texas tourist industry which pumps 17 billion annually into 
the state economy may be especially hurt he said 
i think the problem has been overplayed he said ive had 
people calling me already afraid to go to the rio grande valley 
because they want to know when the killer bees are going to be down 
there 
the bees escaped from a breeding program in sao paulo brazil in 
1957 and have been migrating northward they are less than 500 miles 
from the texas border 
but its unknown just how far north the bees will go 
maxwell speculated the flight will stop north of a line from 
dallas to fort worth to amarillo but he said other scientists 
believe the bees will continue into the northern parts of the 
country 
texas aampm and the us agriculture department are working 
together to track the progress of the bees toward texas scientists 
hopeful of getting early word when the bees arrive have placed traps 
about 10 miles apart along the border from mission to beyond 
brownsville 
maxwell also is seeking more than 250000 from the legislature 
for more research to study the insects 
its not that theres going to any real danger but the public 
needs to be aware of the facts he said 
from that standpoint the educational effort is very important 
so they dont have an undue or excessive or almost hysterical fear

retail gasoline prices for the past two weeks 
remained virtually unchanged but the pump price may increase because 
of a rise in wholesale prices an analyst says 
the lundberg survey of more than 12000 gas stations for the two 
weeks that ended friday showed the average us pump price for all 
grades including taxes was 9825 cents 
that price was only ninehundredths of a penny off from the price 
reported on jan 2 but average wholesale prices jumped more than a 
1 13 cents during the same two week period 
analyst trilby lundberg said if the wholesale price rise 
continues many retailers will be hard pressed to pass their 
increases on 
the survey found average price at selfservice pumps for regular 
unleaded was 8792 cents per gallon 10407 for premium unleaded 
and 8466 cents for regular leaded 
at full service pumps the average price for regular unleaded was 
11823 premium unleaded 12978 and regular leaded 11487

a strong earthquake shook mountainous tadzhikistan 
in soviet central asia early monday destroying buildings and 
causing an unspecified number of deaths the official tass news 
agency said 
the tremor struck the southwestern part of the republic located 
north of afghanistan and bordering china at 202 am moscow time 
602 pm est sunday it registered 60 on the richter scale 
according to the us geological survey in washington and seven on 
the 12point soviet scale 
the quake caused destruction and casualties tass said 
its epicenter was 30 miles southwest of the republics capital of 
dushanbe near the village of sharora the agency said 
small buildings made from earth were hit especially hard the 
quake caused a serious landslide some two kilometers 1 miles 
long from a hill near the village tass said 
the quake also was felt in dushanbe but no damage was reported 
there 
it was the strongest quake to hit the soviet union since the 
devastating dec 7 shock that hit northern armenia 1300 miles to 
the west that quake destroyed many new apartment buildings and 
killed an estimated 25000 people 
in some places the armenian quake was recorded at a magnitude of 
more than 10 on the soviet scale which is based on observable 
effects of quakes 
a 7 magnitude quake on the soviet scale is considered very 
strong and capable of cracking stone walls 
a quake of 60 magnitude on the richter scale can cause severe 
damage in populated areas the richter scale is a measure of ground 
motion as recorded on a seismograph every increase of one number 
means that the ground motion is 10 times greater

the confusing new soviet election system could pit 
human rights activist andrei d sakharov in a campaign battle 
against a member of the ruling politburo and another communist who 
ran afoul of party leaders 
i believe a more democratic mechanism of nominating candidates 
is needed said sakharov who was selected both as a moscow 
district and atlarge candidate for a the new 2250member congress 
of peoples deputies 
more than 900 people jammed into a meeting sunday that 
unanimously nominated the nobel peace prizewinning physicist for 
the atlarge post in the march 26 elections an activist said at 
least 500 people waited outside the hastily organized session at the 
house of filmmakers 
yuri mityunov a participant said a city election commission 
member told the meeting that politburo member vitaly i vorontnikov 
and moscows deposed communist party leader boris yeltsin were 
running for the same atlarge seat 
the stillpopular yeltsin sacked as moscow party boss in 1987 for 
his outspoken criticism of conservatives he blamed for the slow pace 
of reforms 
the possible campaign battle among sakharov vorontnikov and 
yeltskin and the scramble among thousands of candidates nationwide 
depends on twists and turns in the new political system charted by 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
the new congress announced in december by gorbachev will meet 
annually and choose the soviet president and members of a new 
smaller and more active sitting parliament or supreme soviet 
one third of the deputies are to be chosen from candidates 
nominated not on traditional basis of geographic districts but from 
the party unions professional organizations and other officially 
recognized groups 
candidates may not espouse views contrary to the constitution 
which enshrines the communist party as the leading force in soviet 
society 
rankandfile party members nominated 31500 candidates for 100 
seats but on jan 10 the policymaking central committee 
recommended 100 of them and the politburo put them on the ballot 
sakharov 67 was rejected as a candidate by the prestigious 
academy of sciences last week causing an angry protest by his 
coworkers at the lebedev institute of physics they then nominated 
him as a candidate from moscows oktyabr district 
with his selection as an atlarge candidate sakharov must now 
make up his mind which seat he will seek 
his nomination goes to an official electoral commission that will 
select the candidates to actually be placed before voters it could 
put forward all of those nominated but it also could reduce the 
number to just one 
no date has been set for the commissions crucial meeting and the 
winnowing process has led to confusion and complaints of 
manipulation 
the communist party newspaper pravda reported sunday that the 
central council of trade unions refused to endorse reformist 
economist tatyana zaslavskaya because of her call for price 
increases to right the economy it did endorse its chairman stepan 
shalaev who called for more vacation time 
in leningrad tass said 55yearold factory worker gennady 
bogomolov declared a monthlong hunger strike friday because the 
committee at his factory refused to hold a meeting to nominate him 
bogomolov a winner of the governments state prize said party 
officials pressured the workers council not to nominate him because 
of longstanding differences over pay and restructuring the economy 
tass said 
the newspaper komsomolskaya pravda displayed on its front page 
friday the text of a telegram saying two scientists and a journalist 
had gone on a hunger strike in stavropol a city where gorbachev 
once served as communist party chief because city officials refused 
to allow them to organize a local nominating meeting 
the tass news agency reported on sunday that metropolitan alexei 
whose russian orthodox diocese includes leningrad and estonia has 
been nominated by workers of an agricultural complex because of his 
concern over environmental issues the law specifically allows 
clerical candidates 
though there are promises of reform soviet churches still are 
under stalinera laws that require they be registered and prevent 
them from organizing religious education or charity

a founder of the surrealist movement dali is the last of an 
outstanding generation of spanish painters that included pablo 
picasso and joan miro 
to most critics dali was a flawed talent sometimes managing to 
ably balance realistic technique and irrational content but all too 
often caught up in his own role as a poseurpainter he completed 
most of his critically successful works before he was 35 
dr carles ponsati the head of figueras hospital and the 
painters personal physician said death came at 1015 am 415 
am est 
the cause of death was cardiac arrest brought on by his 
respiratory insufficiency and pneumonia ponsati told reporters 
dali was rushed to the hospital four days ago from his home in 
this city near the french border the painter who suffered chronic 
heart ailments in recent years had been hospitalized three times 
since late november 
he had been in poor health since suffering severe burns in an 
electrical fire in his home in august 1984 after recovering from 
his injuries dali was confined to a wheelchair 
the dali theatermuseum where the artist will be buried was 
closed sunday so 12 workers could build the tomb expected to be 
finished in about two days said the secretary of the galadali 
foundation francisco verges

museum just beneath a great glass dome crowning the building in

relatives of some murder victims said they were mostly relieved 
to hear about ted bundys confessions but at least one remained 
incredulous that he will go to the electric chair and one wanted to 
watch him die 
meantime bundys mother said she was going through hell 
thomas leach whose 12yearold daughter kimberly was bundys 
last victim doubted the execution would proceed saying they 
aint going to do nothing 
but kimberlys uncle frank fender wants to witness bundys 
execution for killing his niece who disappeared from lake city 
junior high on feb 9 1978 
i want to look in his eyes and see him before they put the hood 
on fender said referring to the dark hood placed over an 
inmates head just before electrocution state policy bars victims 
relatives from attending executions but a state official promised 
to review the request today 
eleanore rose of burien wash said she felt a hatred even 
stronger than i had ever felt before when she learned the 
42yearold law school dropout had confessed to killing her 
19yearold daughter denise naslund 
i can hardly wait for tuesday to come she said referring to 
bundys scheduled execution in florida its like he completely 
governed my life my existence just waiting waiting 
dale and vivian rancourt of laconner wash parents of victim 
susan rancourt 18 said bundys confession in her slaying and his 
execution would end their 15yearold ordeal 
its like a big puzzle thats been going on for years for 
us said rancourt there were two pieces left one was the 
absolute absolute confirmation from the words of the 
perpetrator the other will be his execution and then the puzzle is 
complete 
when this is over i think we can finally start the end of the 
healing process mrs rancourt added its been an open wound 
for 15 years and every time we think its settling down something 
happens 
bundy was sentenced to death nine years ago in florida but the 
execution repeatedly was delayed by his appeals 
rosemary arnaud mother of 22yearold brenda ball who 
disappeared outside a burien wash tavern in 1974 said bundys 
death will be a relief only in the knowledge that he will never be 
able to kill again 
bundys mother louise who lives in tacoma with his stepfather 
john bundy said the confessions were unexpected because we have 
staunchly believed and i guess we still do until we hear what he 
really said that he was not guilty of any of those crimes 
but if this is true if ted did do these things and if indeed 
he is substantiating it with facts that he really did those things 
its the most devastating news of our lives 
were going through hell were suffering a lot we didnt 
want him to do this 
she said her anguish was not only for her family but for the 
families of the victims 
i agonize for the parents of those girls she said we have 
girls of our own who are very dear to us oh its so terrible 
i just cant understand

south korea agreed today to a communist 
north korean proposal for preliminary political talks next month and 
said the two nations were within sight of ending their bitter 
rivalry 
south korean prime minister kang younghoon accepted a north 
korean plan for preliminary talks feb 8 to set terms for major 
talks headed by premiers of the two nations on ways to end their 
40year confrontation 
the south and the north have crossed the threshold to open a 
new era of reconciliation and cooperation by coming out of an old 
era of antagonism and confrontation kang said in the letter 
turned over at the panmunjom border truce site 
north korea agreed jan 16 to a south korean proposal to upgrade 
proposed political and military talks to the prime ministerial level 
in what would be the highest level contact between the two sides 
since the korean war 
the two sides will hold preliminary talks at panmunjom feb 8 
with fivemember delegations headed by vice ministers to set terms 
for the premiers talks 
in a seaparate development today north korean olympic committee 
chief kim yu sun sent a letter to the south proposing a meeting 
march 9 at panmunjom to discuss the two koreas fielding a joint team 
at the asian games in beijing in 1990 
the north korean letter which was also turned over at panmunjom 
said the north was convinced that an agreement could be reached if 
the two sides talked in an atmosphere of mutual reconciliation and 
trust 
the two koreas are involved in an unprecedented series of 
contacts ranging from parliamentary negotiations on a possible 
nonaggression pact to economic cultural and personnel exchanges 
the talks headed by the two prime ministers are to consider 
resolving political and military disputes between the two rival 
nations 
delegations of lawmakers from the two sides have been holding 
separate meetings on trying to set terms for fullscale talks 
between the norths and souths legislatures on peacebuilding 
measures 
south korean officials hope the totalitarian north may be ready 
to seek improved relations and an end to the long rivalry for 
control of the divided korean peninsula 
but there are indications north korea also hopes to use the talks 
to try and secure withdrawal of the 42000 us troops based in the 
south under a mutual defense treaty and that it is still unwilling 
to accept the seoul government 
the two koreas are technically still at war since no peace treaty 
was signed in 1953 at the end of the korean war boths sides have 
hundreds of thousands of troops facing each other along the border 
and there have been frequent clashes over the years 
korea was divided by us and soviet troops who ended the 
japanese occupation in 1945 at the end of the second world war

where once there had been riots an ice cream truck 
attracted hungry children a group played basketball friends worked 
on a car engine 
next door to a looted burnedout grocery store three youths sat 
in lawn chairs and watched a portable television 
throughout miamis impoverished troubled black neighborhoods of 
overtown and liberty city sundays super bowl preempted any 
lingering racial tension 
a crack deal was visible on one corner at game time a youth 
whose friends said he had been involved in the rioting cruised the 
neighborhood in a rented car and flashed a wad of cash 
just a typical sunday residents said 
even police officers manning barricades and strike teams called 
field forces sat on squad car hoods watching the game eating 
potato chips and giving the latest score to passing motorists 
theres more excitement about the game now than about what 
happened said anthony burnes a resident of overtowns public 
housing projects who donned a bengals tshirt while watching the 
game with friends 
everything seems normal now 
not everything when a window shattered at an apartment complex 
across from the tvwatching police field force in liberty city an 
officer immediately drew his gun and crouched behind his car 
these guys are dead tired said the commander of the force 
who declined to give his name because he normally works undercover 
and late sunday a black man who fired on two police officers in 
liberty city was shot by one of the officers authorities said the 
man was listed in stable but not critical condition jackson 
memorial hospital officials said 
three nights of rioting last week were sparked by the fatal 
shooting of an unarmed black motorcyclist by a hispanic policeman 
a panel of police officers and overtown residents that was 
established by the city to investigate the shooting was holding its 
first working meeting today in addition various local state and 
federal agencies are investigating 
with the violence barely subsided police at joe robbie stadium 
north of miami kept security extra tight for the super bowl in 
which the san francisco 49ers defeated the cincinnati bengals 2016 
before a sellout crowd of more than 75000 
some 300 officers maintained checkpoints at the game and allowed 
only ticketholders close to the stadium 
the biggest security problem however appeared to be coping with 
fans who had their wallets or worse their tickets lifted by 
pickpockets two dozen arrests were made police said 
police posted barricades around the black neighborhoods at 
nightfall but aside from the police shooting there were no reports 
of unusual violence 
in miami beach a few miles to the east the scene was anything 
but calm several thousand football fans and sunworshippers clad in 
bathing suits gathered around a giant tv screen outside a beachfront 
bar to watch the game while sitting in the sand 
this is the place to be said katie carrillo a bears fan 
from chicago you can watch the game and look at all these men 
were here for the men 
the rioting left one man dead and 11 others were treated for 
gunshot wounds thirteen buildings were torched and others looted 
and 372 people were arrested in three nights of unrest authorities 
said 
fans said the violence didnt scare them away from the super bowl 
showdown 
it didnt bother me said frances schroder a 49ers season 
ticketholder from placerville calif we were going to come even 
if there was a hurricane an earthquake or whatever

afghan guerrilla leaders said today 
they have delayed convening a council to form an interim government 
because of differences between pakistan and iranbased insurgents 
qaribur rehman saeed a spokesman for the hezbiislami insurgent 
group said the pakistanbased guerrilla alliance was sending a 
delegation to iran to try to persuade insurgents there to 
participate in the consultative council 
because it has been delayed from feb 1 to feb 10 the meeting 
will come just five days before the soviet deadline for ending its 
nineyear involvement in afghanistans bitter civil war 
the meeting is to be held near the pakistani border town of 
peshawar 
saeed said the dispute centers on the proportional repesentation 
of the mainly sunni moslem rebels based in pakistan and the smaller 
shiite groups operating from iran 
four of eight iranbased groups announced over the weekend they 
would boycott the council meeting because too few seats were 
allotted to them 
the peshawarbased alliance labored over the weekend to choose 
420 representatives from its ranks 60 from each of the seven 
parties 
guerrilla leaders also assigned their iranbased comrades 60 
seats despite their demand for 120 of the 480 seats 
they are not satisfied but i think we can compromise saeed 
said 
shiites comprise about 17 percent of afghanistans population 
but make up about 40 percent of the afghans who have fled their 
country since 1978 when a marxist government seized power in a 
military coup 
soviet forces intervened a year later to replace one marxist 
government with another then remained to help it fight a growing 
insurgency 
of the estimated 15 million afghans onethird now live outside 
afghanistan 3 million in pakistan and 2 million in iran 
guerrilla leaders have resolutely refused to include members of 
the kabul government whom they view as traitors on the council 
whose task is to choose a transitional government and approve a 
temporary head of state 
that government is to oversee the election of a 350member 
parliament through balloting over three months from feb 1 among 
afghan refugees in pakistan and iran and among afghans living in 
rebelcontrolled areas of their own country 
the parliament in turn is to approve a new constitution and 
oversee a general election sometime within a year the election 
would produce a permanent postwar afghan government 
the soviets agreed under a unmediated accord to withdraw their 
100000 troops by feb 15 half left by aug 15 and the soviets 
have said they would honor the feb 15 deadline 
there is widespread fear of chaos if the fractious guerrillas do 
not agree on a political solution before the deadline 
if they dont get their act together and fast we may not see 
an end to the war said a western diplomat in islamabad speaking 
on condition of anonymity 
some western diplomats believe the kabul regime will fall quickly 
once the red army is gone and the mainlyconscripted afghan army is 
left to face the rebels alone 
others predict that a huge stockpile of soviet arms and 
ammunition left behind may enable the government to hold onto major 
afghan cities for months

voters in the key southern state of tamil 
nadu dealt prime minister rajiv gandhi a major political setback by 
overwhelmingly rejecting his party in legislative elections results 
showed today 
the prime minister who must call nationwide elections this year 
had campaigned at least nine times in the state since september and 
saturdays balloting was considered a barometer of his popularity 
gandhis congress party won just 26 of the 232 contested seats in 
the state legislature while the dravida progressive front and its 
allies captured 170 seats said the chief state electoral officer 
dk oza 
its a verdict against rajiv gandhi the leader of the 
victorious party muthuvel karunanidhi told hundreds of cheering 
supporters who gathered outside his home in central madras i hope 
this victory is repeated in the national elections 
the hindu newspaper of madras today called the results a severe 
blow to the image and prospects of the party in power which went 
out of the way to make this appear a contest of vital political 
significance 
the results of the national parliamentary balloting which gandhi 
must by law call by december will determine who leads india for the 
next five years 
early returns today showed gandhis party leading in the states 
of mizoram and nagaland which have a history of insurgency and 
unrest news reports said 
the congress won eight seats in the 60member assemby in 
nagaland while its only challenger the nagaland peoples council 
had six according to united news of india 
in mizoram gandhis party led in a threeway race for the 
40seat assembly congress captured six seats compared with two for 
the mizo national front and one for the peoples conference the 
news agency said 
gandhi campaigned in all three states but most of the attention 
centered on tamil nadu where the dravida progressive front regained 
power after 12 years 
the party was backed by gandhis most visible national political 
foe vp singh a former finance and defense minister for gandhi 
singh is trying to unite an unruly coalition of three opposition 
parties in northern india to challenge gandhi in the national 
parliamentary election 
the results in tamil nadu will have an effect on the national 
politics said cho ramaswamy a respected political commentator 
vp singh will project the dmks victory as his own and many 
members of the congress party will be jittery 
karunanidhi 66 served tamil nadus chief minister the states 
highest elected official from 1967 to 1976 he then lost to 
actorpolitician mg ramachandran who governed until his death in 
december 1987 
the remnants of ramachandrans party which split into two 
factions led by the actors former leading lady and by his widow 
won 33 seats in saturdays balloting independents led in two 
districts and final results were pending in eight others 
elections were postponed in two others because candidates died

ptl founder jim bakker has selected as his 
attorney a flamboyant octogenarian whose legal career spans six 
decades and whose clients have included alfried krupp at the 
nuremberg trials 
george t davis may not be a household name like melvin belli or 
f lee bailey but he has defended some notable clients including 
krupp heir to the german munitions empire who was convicted in 1948 
of war crimes and sentenced to 12 years he was released after three 
years 
among the others caryl chessman who was executed for kidnapping 
two women and sexually assaulting them in 1948 and labor agitator 
tom mooney who was sentenced to death for his participation in the 
1916 bomb killings of 10 people in california mooney was given an 
unconditional pardon in 1939 
throughout davis long career his courtroom style often has been 
colorful 
i always try my cases a little differently davis said 
lets just leave it at that 
his background includes paying his way through the law school of 
the university of california at berkeley in the 1920s by playing 
drums in a jazz band he has studied hypnosis portrayed himself in 
a documentary and is writing a book about the death penalty 
at 81 davis remains active as evidenced by his workout before 
an 8 am interview last week he still finds time to work on his 
horse ranch in hawaii where he lives with his fourth wife ginger 
davis walks his dog for an hour every morning and he occasionally 
surfs 
explaining that he didnt want to jeopardize chances of getting a 
gag order he sought last week davis agreed to discuss the ptl case 
only in general terms and his impressions of his client 
bakker 48 and his former top deputy richard dortch 57 were 
accused in a dec 5 indictment of diverting more than 4 million in 
ptl funds for their personal use two other former aides brothers 
david and james taggart were accused in a separate indictment with 
federal tax violations 
all four have pleaded innocent to the charges which came at the 
end of a 16month grand jury investigation bakkers us district 
court trial has not been scheduled 
davis who spent most of his career in san francisco before 
moving to hawaii met bakker the day the indictments were issued 
he was introduced to bakker through a mutual acquaintance a 
texas minister davis no supporter of bakkers ministry in the 
past did not discuss his religious views nor did he cite religion 
as a motive 
neither was it money or prestige that persuaded him to take the 
case he said 
this is one of my cause cases he said ive always been 
motivated to help people this case is complicated and its 
difficult it just fits into what my whole lifetime motivation has 
been 
for that reason i was ready to make the sacrifice and believe 
me theres no amount of money that could cover the sacrifice of 
giving up four to six months of my time at this stage it is worth 
a lot more than any money 
its like a glass of water on the desert how much is it worth 
its worth a lot more if its the last glass 
davis first impression of bakker persuaded him to take the case 
i dont think hes a criminal he said i think he was 
overwhelmed by the immensity of the work that he was doing 
when you stop to think of all the operations he was running and 
funding and handling and the need that he had for help for 
assistance hes really not a managerial type hes a minister 
davis said my whole judgment of him is that hes a decent honest 
man of his word 
moreover it doesnt bother him that bakker is not universally 
loved 
almost every case that ive ever handled has been for a 
defendant who at the time he crossed my threshold was considered a 
despicable guy he said that part doesnt bother me at all

a mainstream republican says he believes 
former klansman david duke will receive at least onethird of the 
vote in a runoff election next month for state representative as 
he did in saturdays primary 
if that happens i think it would be damaging to louisianas 
political image said john treen who received 19 percent of the 
primary vote 
treen who got 2277 votes faces duke in a feb 18 election to 
represent the 99 percent white area of jefferson parish 
i think if he duke loses the election it will reaffirm some 
peoples belief that louisiana is making progress said treen 
whose brother david was louisianas first republican governor 
since reconstruction 
but treen said i think if he were to win the election it 
would be news and it would be damaging to our political reputation 
and to our image and that it would probably impair investment in 
this area 
although treen 62 said saturday night that he doubted duke 
would get more votes in the runoff than the 3995 he received in the 
primary he had changed his mind by sunday night 
from an analysis of precinct returns who got what vote where 
i think that he will run substantially stronger than onethird of 
the vote he said 
duke 38 who founded the national association for the 
advancement of white people after leaving the klan in disgrace in 
1980 said hes not a racist and he thinks its unfair that his past 
as an imperial wizard in the knights of the ku klux klan continually 
gets mentioned 
i was never involved in the old jim crow system he said i 
believe in equal rights for everyone thats what ive advocated 
thats what ive preached thats what i believe in 
the real racists are the ones who believe in affirmative 
action 
he said his proposal for incentives to get welfare recipients to 
accept sterilization to cut the illegitimate birthrate isnt a 
racial issue 
the media reported it as black illegitimate welfare ive only 
said illegitimate duke said theyre the ones who suppose 
illegitimate welfare recipients are black 
duke said his showing saturday indicates that his views appeal to 
more people than is generally realized

underground palestinian leaders said in a 
leaflet circulated today they will escalate their rebellion despite 
the armys tough new measures to quell the 13month revolt 
in the west bank city of nablus several firebombs exploded in 
the israeliowned bank leumi injuring several arab employees but 
doing little material damage the army said arab reports said four 
palestinians were treated for burns or smoke inhalation after the 
bombs ignited a blaze inside the bank 
in its latest leaflet the united national leadership of the 
uprising criticized the united states for not backing palestinian 
demands for an independent state 
the american position is still against us and against our 
people and against our national rights said the leaflet we 
call on the americans for an official recognition of the palestine 
liberation organization as a representative of the palestinians and 
to recognize the right to return selfdetermination and the 
establishment of an independent state in palestine 
it was the 33rd leaflet issued since the uprising began in 
december 1987 
israeli newspapers reported today that new rules allowing 
soldiers to shoot plastic and rubber bullets more freely at 
palestinian protesters have sparked controversy and confusion in the 
army 
some senior officers have voiced concern in closeddoor forums 
that the measures could escalate tensions in the rebellion in which 
367 palestinians and 15 israelis have been killed the 
masscirculation maariv daily reported 
because of the concern israeli attorney general yosef harish has 
agreed to review the policy with top legal advisers this week 
several israeli dailies reported 
last week the army announced a new gettough policy that includes 
destroying homes of stonethrowers and firing plastic bullets at 
fleeing assailants and protesters who build stone barricades in the 
streets 
todays leaflet warned the zionist enemy imagines that with 
their latest suppressive measures and by using all kinds of bullets 
they will succeed in crushing the intefadeh uprising we know such 
measures will never stop an escalation of the intefadeh 
plastictipped bullets were introduced last august because they 
are not supposed to be as lethal as lead rounds if fired from at 
least 70 yards away but at least 40 deaths have been attributed to 
the plastic ammunition israeli newspapers have reported 
chief of staff lt gen dan shomron was quoted today as saying of 
new regulations it is true you can fire but only at those who 
actually cause a danger and one of the dangers is roadblocks 
he told israel radio i assume these means will result in 
diminishing the actions aimed against us and israeli citizens in the 
territories maybe at the first stage it will lead to tension but if 
we see it in longer perspective i assume it will eventually bring a 
relaxation 
the haaretz daily said troops last week were instructed not to 
fire lead ammunition at protesters and to avoid shooting women and 
children under 16 
according to haaretz soldiers may fire plastic bullets during a 
violent disturbance which the regulations define as 
stonethrowing erecting roadblocks or burning tires by three or 
more protesters

clayton jaques has no hands his coaches 
and teammates say he makes up for that with his heart 
jaques 15 played softball last summer in a recreational league 
and football last fall for reed city high school hes now playing 
basketball for the schools freshman team and plans to go out for 
track in the spring while maintaining an a average and a spot on the 
student council 
because of birth defects jaques left arm ends near the elbow 
and his right arm ends just short of the wrist his left foot has no 
big toe and is smaller and narrower than his right foot 
that means each sport as well as routine activities like holding 
a pencil and getting dressed require special adjustments but 
jaques and those close to him say theres a common thread running 
through everything he does 
he has something not everybody has a desire to do his best 
and win said kevin oxley jaques basketball coach 
hes just one of the guys said ty weiss a teammate he 
does everything just as well or better than we do hes earned our 
respect 
in football he was one of the best players on the team youd 
have to respect him or hed tear you apart 
jaques 15 said hes been inspired by other handicapped athletes 
such as jim abbott the onehanded former pitcher for the university 
of michigan and us olympic team and a california angels draftee 
theres nobody around exactly like me so theres really nobody 
to teach me how to do a lot of these things so i have to teach 
myself jaques said 
but when you want something bad enough and you have had 15 
years to practice you can usually do it nothing should be able to 
stop you 
few things stopped jaques when he played football last fall for 
reed city 
are there limits for him asked football coach kevin lang 
logically youd say yes but after ive seen some of the things 
ive seen i couldnt say what those limits are 
one of the things that amazed lang most happened in practice when 
he gave anyone who wanted a chance to play quarterback jaques got 
in line 
he threw three tight spirals 30 yards downfield for 
receptions said lang i dont know how he does it 
jaques said he doesnt know either 
i dont really know but i just kind of learned how he said 
i guess its just like people with hands i just feel when its 
the right release point its the same thing with shooting a 
basketball 
the teenager has prostheses intended to operate as false hands 
but rarely uses them the devices are like wearing snowmobile 
boots in the summertime he says 
jaques eventually became a twoway lineman before injuries to 
teammates earned him an invitation to try out at running back 
the first time he touched the ball he went 85 yards for a 
touchdown lang said he averaged 147 yards per carry he had 
only one fumble and that was in the first game i thought that was 
quite miraculous

the soviet military today stepped up 
food airlifts to kabul to ease shortages it blamed on hoarding by 
traders and inefficiency by the afghan regime 
moslem guerrillas reported heavy fighting near the soviet border 
in northern afghanistan and said they shot down three aircraft 
the rebelrun afghan news agency claimed guerrillas on saturday 
attacked the city of kunduz 36 miles from the soviet border 
fighting has continued since and a large number of soldiers were 
killed at kunduz airport area the news agency said 
according to the report the downed aircraft included a 
sovietbuilt mig21 jet fighter 
at the airport in kabul soviet troops unloaded hundreds of sacks 
of flour from giant ilyushin 76 transport planes 
the local authorities did not give out the orders in time for 
when they needed to get food supplies said maj gen lev 
serebrov a member of the soviet military command in kabul 
and some of the traders are not selling in order to raise 
prices he said there are enough supplies in the city and they 
are keeping it to themselves 
reporters were restricted to an area of the airport where the 
soviet transports landed behind a fence in the distance about 30 
soviet troops waited with baggage and checked in their rifles 
apparently ready to leave 
on sunday serebrov denied the soviets have renewed their pullout 
from afghanistan but said they still plan to be out of the country 
by a feb 15 deadline he also said the red army is leaving with a 
sense of failure 
we have not succeeded in everything we planned to do here he 
said we came here with an honorable task with open hearts we 
are leaving and we have a sense of not having accomplished our 
mission to the end 
but serebrov said the soviets withdrawal after nine years in 
afghanistan compared favorably with the us exit from vietnam 
your generals ran away from saigon he told an american 
reporter at a news briefing but we have a withdrawal that is 
proceeding according to a timetable 
we are ready to end the withdrawal by feb 15 but we have 
not yet received the order to start the final stage of withdrawal 
he added 
pressed about visual evidence of troops leaving serebrov 
speaking through an interpreter said the departing troops had 
merely completed their twoyear military service and are being 
replaced with new ones 
heavy snowfall and growing rebel attacks on supply convoys on the 
salang highway from the soviet border have been blamed for the food 
shortages in the capital 
the shortages have eased since the soviets began the emergency 
airlift friday lines for bread which previously began forming 
early in the day and stretched for blocks have shortened or 
disappeared in some parts of the city 
serebrov who invited western reporters to the airport to see the 
transports arriving said 400 to 500 tons of flour were arriving 
daily on 12 to 15 flights from the soviet cities of tashkent and 
fergana both about an hour by plane from kabul 
during the twohour visit to the airport three transports landed 
and one took off 
processions of military trucks crawled through the city taking 
flour to storaged depots controlled by the sovietbacked government 
serebrov said the soviet airlifts probably will continue until 
the end of the week 
the islamic unity of afghan mujahedeen a rebel alliance group 
based in peshawar pakistan also said today that it was sending 
emergency food to afghans in kabul 
a statement issued by the afghan news agency did not say when or 
how much food would be sent 
it remained unclear how long food supplies will last or whether 
the soviets will be able to resume airlifts if necessary 
about 50000 soviet troops pulled out of afghanistan in august 
under an agreement mediated by the united nations to end the soviet 
militarys nineyear intervention in the nation the 50000 
remaining troops are to leave by feb 15 
the guerrillas have been fighting the government since the 
communists seized power in a coup in april 1978 and they are not a 
party to the un pact they are expected to challenge the afghan 
regime once the soviet pullout is completed 
the soviets announced late last year they had indefinitely 
suspended the withdrawal of remaining troops because of continued 
us and pakistani aid to the guerrillas 
western diplomats have said the withdrawal resumed early this 
month

the supreme court today refused to revive 
actress vanessa redgraves lawsuit against the boston symphony 
orchestra for canceling her performances following threats by 
protesters 
the court without comment let stand a 39500 
breachofcontract award won by ms redgrave but barred any 
additional damages based on claims that her civil and constitutional 
rights were violated 
ms redgrave was hired by the symphony in 1982 to narrate six 
performances of stravinskys operaoratorio oedipus rex at 
boston the orchestras tanglewood concerts in western massachusetts 
and new yorks carnegie hall 
the contract was canceled after the symphony received letters and 
telephone calls from people threatening to picket and protest the 
performances because of ms redgraves support for the palestine 
liberation organization 
after several rounds of state and federal court hearings the 1st 
us circuit court of appeals last september ruled that ms 
redgraves rights were not violated 
the appeals court awarded her 12000 as compensation for a part 
in a broadway production she said she lost because of the boston 
symphony controversy that amount was reduced from the 100000 a 
federal jury had awarded her 
the appeals court also upheld the award of the 27500 fee ms 
redgrave was to receive for the oedipus rex performances 
the symphony successfully argued that it did not violate a 
massachusetts civil rights law protecting freedom of expression when 
it canceled the contract 
lawyers for the symphony said it acted legitimately out of 
concern that threatened disruptions would mar the artistic integrity 
of the performances 
in the appeal acted on today ms redgraves lawyers said she was 
the victim of blacklisting 
in a free society peoples livelihoods should not depend upon 
their holding correct political views as defined either by their 
government or by their employer the appeal said 
it added that the contract was canceled solely because ms 
redgrave had expressed a political view unpopular in some 
circles namely that the palestinian people should have a homeland 
of their own 
the appeal said the symphony was trying to hide behind a defense 
of artistic integrity to shield itself from legal liability 
the case is redgrave vs boston symphony 88912

the supreme court today let stand a ruling that 
illinois prison officials violated the rights of inmates in 
protective custody at the stateville correctional center 
the court without comment rejected arguments by state officials 
that the protectivecustody inmates were not entitled to the same 
programs services and living conditions as inmates in the general 
prison population 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals ruled last july that the 
unequal treatment afforded those in protective custody violated 
constitutional rights 
bad prisons are not inevitable the appeals court said in 
rejecting arguments by officials that they were protecting security 
at stateville 
the appeals court also ordered further trial hearings to 
determine what damages the protectivecustody inmates are owed 
illinois officials have failed to convince us that the cutback 
of essential programs and services for protectivecustody inmates at 
stateville has a legitimate rational basis the appeals court said 
it noted that the inmates were segregated from the general prison 
population at the maximumsecurity institution to protect them not 
to punish them 
the protectivecustody inmates were not allowed to take part in 
communal worship services or classroom religious instruction their 
access to the library was strictly limited vocational and 
educational programs designed to rehabilitate prisoners were not 
available to them they said their food was inferior and they had to 
eat all meals in their cells and they were allowed only 75 minutes 
of dayroom or yard recreation every other day 
the appeals court said those inmates suffered inferior treatment 
because prison officials had no desire to make improvements 
the 7th circuit court also upheld the appointment of a special 
master to oversee improvements ordered by a federal trial judge 
appointment of a master is appropriate because of the many 
instances of administrative recalcitrance the appeals court 
said 
officials from kansas and indiana joined in urging the justices 
to throw out the 7th circuit court ruling 
the case is lane vs williams 88899

a dozen us war veterans are returning 
to vietnam to build a rural health clinic to help the vietnamese 
and also help ourselves members of the group said today 
groundbreaking for the project believed to be the first 
reconstruction effort by us veterans in vietnam is scheduled 
jan 31 the group which includes carpenters electricians and 
architects is to spend 10 weeks building an eightroom clinic in 
the southern seacoast town of vung tau 
it seemed like a way to heal the insanity of the war itself 
said ruben robert gomez of santa cruz calif wed like to see 
american handson restoration in vietnam and put it behind us 
members of the veteransvietnam restoration project a small 
california veterans group say the clinic will meet an urgent need 
for better medical care in rural vietnam help foster 
usvietnamese ties and perhaps serve to alleviate individual 
psychological and moral problems from the war 
a psychiatrist who specializes in helping vietnam war veterans 
will accompany the group to evaluate effects of the effort on 
participants 
gomez said the project cost of 60000 to 100000 and the supply 
of medicine and equipment is being met by a number of private 
organizations including operation california the christopher 
reynolds foundation and the us committee for scientific 
cooperation with vietnam 
everywhere i go people say hey great good luck to you 
gomez said in an interview adding that more than 80 veterans had 
applied to join the group 
vietnams foreign minister nguyen co thach in october 
personally wrote the group giving them permission to build the 
clinic 
gordon smith 38 of monterey calif said vietnamese officials 
have expressed interest in the veterans carrying out other 
smallscale reconstruction projects including the rebuilding of a 
firedamaged orphanage in ho chi minh city formerly called saigon 
and another health clinic in northern vietnam 
smith said american veterans groups are limited in the kind of 
aid they can provide given the us trade embargo on vietnam the 
us government can make exceptions on humanitarian grounds and has 
allowed the group to spend up to 32000 in vietnam itself 
a lot of us are returning to finish unfinished business 
smith said we were dealing with destruction now we want to do 
something constructive american veterans have gone back to vietnam 
as tourists or to talk about problems like the missing in action 
but were going to work well be covered with sweat 
also today vietnam gave us officials the remains of 23 people 
it believes are those of us soldiers killed in the vietnam war 
said ross petzing a spokesman for the us embassy in bangkok he 
said the remains were being flown to the us joint casualty 
resolution center in hawaii aboard a us air force plane 
over the past year vietnam has stepped up cooperation with 
washington to resolve the issue of mias the united states says it 
prevents normalization of ties with hanoi 
currently 2383 americans are listed as mia in indochina with 
1747 in vietnam

the supreme court in a case sparked by a 
football recruiting scandal at southern methodist university today 
refused to let news organizations see confidential investigation 
files on smu and other texas schools 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that files 
compiled by the national collegiate athletic association and the 
southwest athletic conference do not have to be made public under 
the texas open records act 
in the wake of the smu scandal that resulted in ncaa sanctions 
against the dallas school some texas news organizations sought 
disclosure of investigation files compiled by the association 
they also sought files compiled by the ninemember southwest 
conference which in addition to smu has three other public texas 
universities as members 
when the requests were denied the news organizations sued 
invoking the 1973 state law that requires governmental bodies 
receiving public funds generally to make public their internal 
documents 
a federal trial judge ruled that the state law applies to the 
ncaa and the southwest conference and ordered that the soughtafter 
documents be surrendered so it could be determined which should be 
made public 
but the 5th us circuit court of appeals reversed that ruling 
last july 26 
the appeals court agreed that the ncaa and the southwest 
conference receive texas public funds but it said they are not 
governmental bodies defined in the state law as those entities 
supported in whole or in part by public funds 
the ncaa and the conference provide specific measurable services 
in return for the texas tax money they receive and therefore are 
not supported by that money the 5th circuit court concluded 
the news organizations then sought the supreme courts help 
they argued that the appeals court wrongly reversed the trial 
judges factual rulings without finding that those rulings were 
clearly erroneous 
the appeal acted on today also argued that the appeals court 
failed to follow controlling texas law that athletic associations 
receiving money from public texas universities and colleges for 
their general support are subject to the open records act 
the appeal was supported in a friendofthecourt brief 
submitted by state attorney general jim mattox and his staff 
noting that a 1987 attorney generals opinion on the open records 
act was ignored by the appeals court mattox said absent contrary 
state law the 5th circuit court must follow applicable attorney 
general open records decisions

the supreme court today refused to kill a 
150000 libel lawsuit against a waco texas newspaper by a justice 
of the peace wrongly identified in a news article as a convicted 
thief 
the justices without comment let stand rulings that force the 
waco tribuneherald to defend itself at trial against john b 
guinns suit 
in the papers jan 24 1984 edition a tribuneherald story 
about various federal court actions reported that john b guinn of 
copperas cove was given a fiveyear probated sentence and ordered 
to pay restitution for theft on a government reservation 
in fact guinn had served as the lawyer for the man sentenced 
in addition to his law practice guinn is an elected justice of 
the peace in coryell county guinns hometown of copperas cover is 
about 100 miles from waco 
when the newspaper discovered its mistake a retraction was 
printed promptly but guinn sued nevertheless seeking 50000 in 
compensatory damages and 100000 in punitive damages 
a state trial judge threw out the suit before it reached a jury 
ruling that guinn failed to show that the mistake had been made with 
actual malice 
public officials and public figures who sue for libel must prove 
that the suedover statement was false and was made with actual 
malice knowledge or reckless disregard of falsity 
all other people who sue for libel must show only that the 
statement was false and was made negligently an easier burden of 
proof 
a state appeals court reversed the trial judges dismissal of the 
case the appeals court said guinn should not have been considered a 
public official for the purposes of his suit against the newspaper 
the newspaper item did not refer to guinn in his official 
capacity furthermore the content of the article did not expressly 
relate to guinns official conduct as a justice of the peace nor 
was it concerned with guinns performance of his official duties 
the appeals court said 
it added that the newspapers lawyers offered no evidence to show 
that guinn was known as a public official beyond the confines of 
his region 
the texas supreme court refused to hear the tribuneheralds 
ensuing appeal last jan 6 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for cox enterprises 
publisher of the newspaper argued that the texas appeals court 
ruling allows any local official to maintain a libel suit despite 
the lack of malice on the part of the publisher simply if the 
article fails to identify his political office 
in response lawyers for guinn said that ruling against him 
would serve to destroy a public officials right to protect his 
private reputation from unjustified invasion and irreparable 
damage 
the case is cox enterprises vs guinn 88631

the supreme court today refused to postpone a 
trial for a 3 million invasionofprivacy lawsuit against the los 
angeles times 
the justices rejecting the newspapers emergency request 
cleared the way for trial to begin feb 17 in san diego 
the controversy began when the times reported the july 13 1981 
murder in san diego of rose rende 
the article reported correctly that the victims roommate 
identified in court documents only by the fictitious name jane doe 
discovered ms rendes body in their apartment 
the times article also mentioned that one witness who was not 
identified had seen a suspect fleeing from the apartment and had 
described him for police 
the lawsuit against the times contends that the murder suspect 
who knew that the person who discovered the body was the person who 
saw him could have learned of the roommates identity by reading 
the newspaper article 
the suspect has never been caught but court records show that no 
one ever has contacted jane doe or threatened her as a result of the 
article 
the reporter who wrote the article did not know that the suspect 
had seen jane doe and testified in pretrial proceedings that she 
learned of jane does identity from the county coroners office 
the newspaper sought to have the suit which accused it of making 
jane doe a walking target thrown out before it reached a jury 
a california appeals court ruled against the paper it said a 
jury should decide whether publication of jane does real name was 
newsworthy 
the california supreme court refused to hear the newspapers 
ensuing appeal 
the nations highest court last june rejected an emergency 
request by the times mirror co the times publisher aimed at 
postponing any trial until a stillpending formal appeal is acted on 
in asking justice sandra day oconnor to postpone the trial 
lawyers for the times noted that the formal appeal argues that the 
constitutions first amendment shields it and its reporter from 
facing potential liability for routine lawful news gathering and 
reporting about a current crime 
the emergency request added without a stay that central issue 
cannot be addressed because the trial will go forward 
oconnor referred the request to the full court 
the case is times mirror co vs doe a568

british airways acknowledged a security lapse after 
a passengers luggage was put on the wrong flight last week and said 
the airline had acted to prevent it from happening again 
a key part of airline security is the rule that baggage should 
not be loaded unless the owner is traveling on the same plane the 
regulation is believed to reduce greatly the chances of bombs in 
airliner baggage holds 
a passenger traveling from brussels belgium to london on 
wednesday alerted the airline that his luggage had been loaded on an 
earlier flight 
a british airways spokeswoman said sunday the incident had been 
verified 
it was a lapse in security and clearly should not have 
happened we have taken the necessary action aimed at making sure 
that it doesnt happen again said the spokeswoman speaking on 
condition of anonymity in keeping with british practice 
as this is a security matter we are not giving details of what 
action we have taken she said 
airline security has been an especially sensitive subject since 
the dec 21 bombing of a pan am boeing 747 over lockerbie scotland 
which killed 270 people 
investigators still are trying to determine how the explosives 
were planted on board flight 103 which was flying from frankfurt to

the supreme court today agreed to review a 
12year dispute over water rights in wyomings big horn river basin 
the justices said they will study a wyoming supreme court 
decision last year that gave a partial victory to shoshone and 
northern arapahoe indians living on the wind river indian 
reservation 
todays action was taken on an appeal filed by wyoming the 
justices took no action on related appeals filed by the indian 
tribes and the city of riverton 
the state court by a 32 vote had said wyomings admission into 
the united states in 1890 did not supplant the water rights congress 
previously had attached to the reservation 
a reserved water right is implied for an indian reservation 
where water is necessary to fulfill the purposes of the 
reservation the state court said 
but it added that the reserved water rights for the wind river 
reservation were only for agricultural purposes 
wyoming officials sued the federal government and the indian 
tribes in 1977 contending that congress in 1905 intended that the 
reservations future water rights be obtained under wyoming law 
the state supreme court rejected the states arguments on that 
point sparking the appeal by wyoming acted on today but the state 
court also ruled that the amount of water appropriated for the 
tribes use be based only on irrigation needs 
in a cross appeal acted on today the northern arapahoe and 
shoshone tribes challenged that portion of the state courts ruling 
the wyoming appeal was supported in a friendofthecourt 
brief submitted by officials from six other western states

a group supporting the separation of church and 
state today lost a supreme court challenge to a cancellation stamp 
that commemorated a 1987 visit to the united states by pope john 
paul ii 
the court without comment refused to revive a lawsuit by the 
texasbased society of separationists against the postal service 
the groups leader ralph b shirley of austin texas said the 
stamp improperly used taxpayer money to promote religion 
at the request of a customer post offices in the nine cities the 
pope visited in 1987 would use a special rubber stamp bearing the 
emblem of the vatican in rome to cancel postcards and firstclass 
letters 
the cancellation stamps were used only during the popes visit 
shirley said the purpose of the postal service in 
commemorating the visit of the pope is clearly religious the popes 
visit is in no way a secular event 
a federal judge threw out the suit and the dimisssal was upheld 
last july by the 5th us circuit court of appeals 
the appeals court said the case is moot no longer posing a live 
controversy since the stamps were discontinued generally courts 
do not consider cases without live issues 
since the case is moot a court would take it up only if the 
society of separationists can show that the postal service could 
repeat the action in a way that would evade review by the courts 
the appeals court said 
it said the group has not established a demonstrated 
probability or a reasonable expectation that the current pope or his 
successor will visit the us and that the postal service will 
commemorate the event with special cancellations 
shirley said the appeals court ignored the reality of what 
happened during previous papal visits to the united states 
similar cancellation stamps were used to honor pope john paul ii 
in 1979 1981 and twice in 1984 shirley said 
the postal service limits the time that the stamps can be 
challenged in court by waiting until he is about to arrive before 
announcing the stamps shirley said 
this is a sly trick of the postal service to attempt to block 
review of its unlawful acts by the courts added the groups 
appeal acted on today

the supreme court today refused to shield new 
york from possibly paying part of the 702000 award won by the 
family of a man who died 26 years ago in a secret army chemical 
warfare experiment 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that new york may 
be sued by federal officials seeking to force the state to help pay 
the award 
harold blauer was given injections of mescaline derivatives while 
being treated at the new york state psychiatric institute in new 
york city for depression following a divorce 
blauer 42 a teaching tennis professional at country clubs was 
not aware what the drugs were 
the army revealed in 1975 that it had supplied the mescaline as 
part of a chemical warfare experiment 
according to court records blauer was recovering from depression 
and would soon be released from the hospital when he received the 
injections after the fifth and final injection on jan 8 1953 he 
began sweating profusely flailing his arms his body stiffened and 
he frothed at the mouth he went into a coma and died in two hours 
no mention was made of the army experiment in the medical 
examiners report which said the drugs had been used for diagnostic 
purposes 
blauers former wife amy was paid 18000 in 1955 to settle her 
negligence suit against the state 
after the federal government revealed the army experiment in 1975 
during a congressional investigation of another matter blauers 
daughter elizabeth barrett sued the federal and state governments 
a federal judge dismissed the charges against new york on grounds 
that the constitutions 11th amendment shields states against such 
lawsuits 
the 11th amendment gives states immunity from lawsuits in federal 
court by private citizens 
us district judge constance baker motley ruled in 1987 that the 
federal government must pay 702000 to the blauer family for using 
the victim as a guinea pig in an experiment 
the primary reason the army covered up its involvement for 22 
years was to avoid embarrassment and adverse publicity the judge 
said 
the federal government then was allowed to sue new york officials 
to try to force the state to contribute to the damage award 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals ruled last august that 
neither the 11th amendment nor any state law shields new york from 
being sued in such a case by the federal government

the supreme court today refused to revive a 
libel lawsuit against the publisher of us magazine by the daughter 
of a new york doctor who murdered his wife with a drug injection 
the court without comment let stand rulings that esther 
friedgood failed to show that the allegedly libelous statements 
about her were published with actual malice 
her appeal argued that lower courts wrongly treated her as a 
public figure in the case 
dr charles friedgood and his wife sophie lived in kensington 
long island when mrs friedgood died in 1975 
friedgood signed his wifes death certificate stating that the 
cause of death was stroke but a suspicious prosecutor ordered an 
autopsy it was determined that mrs friedgood had been injected 
with a deadly dose of demerol a painkiller 
the newspaper newsday published a series of articles detailing 
the death in 1980 reporter leonard levitt published a book about 
the case 
a review of the levitts book in us magazine said esther 
friedgood was an afterthecrime accomplice because she hid evidence 
of the crime after her father confided in her 
ms friedgood had not known about her fathers role in her 
mothers death when she agreed to hide some bottles and a syringe 
she later cooperated with prosecutors and testified against her 
father 
the appeal acted on today said ms friedgood should have been 
considered a private citizen rather than a public figure for 
purposes of her lawsuit against peters publishing co which 
publishes us 
private citizens who sue for libel must prove the suedover 
statement was false harmful and made negligently 
public figures and public officials who sue for libel face the 
tougher task of proving the suedover statement was false harmful 
and made with actual malice knowledge or reckless disregard of its 
falsity 
ms friedgood a lawyer in west palm beach fla never wanted to 
be a newsmaker in connection with her fathers crime and therefore 
should not have been considered a public figure her appeal said 
but even if she had been a public figure at the time of her 
fathers prosecution the appeal said she was no longer when the 
book review was published 
in a 1979 decision that limited the legal definition of public 
figures the justices left unresolved whether or when an 
individual who was once a public figure may lose that status by the 
passage of time 
a florida state judge who dismissed ms friedgoods suit said she 
had not lost publicfigure status a state appeals court upheld that 
ruling and the florida supreme court refused to review the case 
last aug 29 
the appeals court noting that only a few years separated the 
doctors murder trial and the book review said it would seem 
reasonable to conclude that public discussion about the case may 
continue accordingly ms friedgood should be deemed a limited 
public figure for purposes of the comment about her in the book 
review 
the appeals court then found that she had failed to present 
evidence of actual malice 
the case is friedgood vs peters publishing co 88863

to the 48 polish sailors who jumped ship in boston 
harbor during the past month it was a choice between freedom and 
oppression 
but the merchant seamens fate depends on whether us officials 
believe they are freedomseekers or decide they are fortune hunters 
willing to abandon their homes and families for a chance at economic 
opportunity 
the unusually large wave of defections prompted a visit to boston 
from polish consular officials who invited any defectors having 
second thoughts to return home without fear of repercussion 
but the sailors rebuffed the overtures saying they dont believe 
the promises would be kept 
thats what we ran away from and we didnt want to have 
anything to do with those polish officials said vieslaw a sailor 
who spoke on condition that only his first name be used 
its this classic case of propaganda and theres no doubt in 
my mind that on return to poland we would be incarcerated said 
marek who also declined to give his last name both spoke through 
an interpreter 
the sailors said they were reluctant to be fully identified 
because they feared harassment 
marek kaminski one of the consular officials visiting from new 
york last week portrayed the sailors as adventure seekers who would 
eventually regret their decision 
the polish officials also denied reports that the sailors 
families would be fined or their wives would be fired from their 
jobs 
but wendy lauser program coordinator of the polish social 
cultural association said some of the sailors who contacted 
relatives in poland have been told their wives have been asked to 
appear at special interviews at work 
none of the sailors met with the consular officials said jack 
kowalski mayor raymond flynns liaison to bostons substantial 
polishamerican community 
kowalski said he believed the polish officials were trying to 
gather information about bostons polish community last january 
kowalski worked with a group of 13 sailors who defected the 13 were 
granted asylum in april 
timothy whelan deputy director of the immigration and 
naturalization service in boston said it was possible the polish 
governments overtures could have a bearing on the sailors cases 
whelan said the state department would issue an advisory ruling 
on the sailors cases that would take into consideration polands 
political climate as well as the lengths the sailors had to go to 
to leave their homeland 
officials said they couldnt explain the unusually large wave of 
defections the sailors fled from three fishing vessels visiting 
boston harbor since late december the latest group 16 crewmen 
defected jan 5 
they are seeking political asylum 
for some of them it was a decision they made a long time ago 
for some of them it was a decision they made on the ship said 
lauser who emigrated from poland eight years ago after marrying an 
american she said the decision to leave is often prompted by living 
in a system which promises you a lot all the time and you reach 
the age and you see no changes just words 
marek said he thought a long time before jumping ship 
we were awfully afraid especially at first about our 
decision he said i lamented over the decision for two weeks 
especially about my wife and child 
the two sailors said the reforms outlined by soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev havent reached poland 
what gorbachev is doing in russia is good and noble but its 
too early to really examine the longterm effects he said 
the two sailors who have found jobs in the boston area said 
they have been busy settling in to their new surroundings 
we feel terrific about being here so far said vieslaw 
we feel good because we have shelter we have food the basic 
staples have been provided for marek said 
polishamerican families offered rooms to the sailors but now 
many of them have been able to move into apartments lauser said 
she said all the sailors were issued temporary work permits by the 
ins while they filed for political asylum 
cathryn macinnes a consultant to bostons city government on 
immigration matters is working on the applications which basically 
hinge on whether the sailors would face persecution if they returned 
to poland

the supreme court ruled today that police do 
not need court warrants before searching from helicopters for 
marijuana growing in fencedin yards 
the court by a 54 vote said sheriffs deputies in pasco 
county fla did not violate anyones privacy rights five years ago 
when searching for marijuana from a helicopter hovering 400 feet 
above the ground 
justice byron r white in the courts main opinion said the 
helicopter was in air space where it legally may fly 
the helicopter in this case was not violating the law white 
said and helicopters flying at 400 feet are common enough 
occurrences to make the police conduct reasonable 
the high court in 1986 ruled 54 that a warrantless search by 
santa clara calif police in an airplane flying at a lawful 
altitude of 1000 feet had not violated privacy rights 
in the florida case pasco county deputies received an anonymous 
tip that michael a riley was growing marijuana in his yard 
unable to tell what plants were growing in a greenhouse located 
in the yard the deputies flew over in a helicopter from there 
they could look into the missing panels of the greenhouse roof 
based on what they saw the deputies obtained a search warrant 
and entered rileys yard seizing 44 marijuana plants 
riley challenged the helicopter search seeking to block 
prosecutors from using the seized plants as evidence against him 
the constitutions fourth amendment protects against unreasonable 
police searches and generally requires police to persuade a court 
that reasonable suspicion of criminal activity exists before they 
can search private property 
the florida supreme court ruled for riley saying the search 
violated rileys reasonable expectation of privacy the state court 
noted that fixedwing planes are not allowed to fly at altitudes 
lower than 500 feet 
todays decision reversed the state court ruling 
this is not to say that an inspection of the curtilage yard 
of a house from an aircraft will always pass muster under the fourth 
amendment simply because the plane is within the navigable airspace 
specified by law white said but his opinion did not spell out 
any limits for such searches 
white was joined by chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
justice sandra day oconnor also voted to uphold the florida 
search but wrote a separate concurring opinion 
justices william j brennan thurgood marshall john paul stevens 
and harry a blackmun dissented 
brennan in an opinion joined by marshall and stevens noted that 
the passage in george orwells novel 1984 in which the caption big 
brother is watching you includes this in the far distance a 
helicopter skimmed down between the roofs it was the police 
patrol snooping into peoples windows 
in his opinion brennan asked who can read this passage 
without a shudder and without the instinctive reaction that it 
depicts life in some country other than ours 
the case is florida vs riley 87764

police detained more than 400 
people near the grave of a student who burned himself to death 20 
years ago to protest the sovietled invasion that crushed prague 
spring reforms activists said 
the police action capped czechoslovakias most serious week of 
political unrest since jan palach set himself ablaze in central 
wenceslas square in january 1969 and thousands of people took to the 
streets in shock and grief 
former communist party chief alexander dubcek was quoted sunday 
as saying the young people now demonstrating against communist 
authorities are frustrated by a political and economic system that 
offers them no future 
activist petr uhl said more than 400 protesters were arrested on 
saturday in the village of vsetaty palachs hometown 18 miles from 
prague he said they had tried to hold a vigil at the heavily 
guarded cemetery where palach is buried police had blocked roads 
and interrogated visitors on saturday in an apparent attempt to 
thwart a large demonstration 
the arrests brought to 800 the number of people detained during 
the week of protests most of which occurred in wenceslas square 
where palach set himself afire on jan 16 1969 
in warsaw poland police detained two members of the banned 
polish socialist party during a demonstration today in support of 
the czechoslovak dissidents detained an opposition spokeswoman said 
several dozen people gathered in front of the czechoslovak 
embassy and shouted we are with the czechs the czechs are with 
us and democracy in the whole bloc said spokeswoman zuzanna 
dabrowska

mirzejewski were detained 
the police presence was heavy in prague and vsetaty on sunday and 
no protests were reported

questioned photographed and released 
two activists ludvik marks of the independent youth group czech 
children and martin litomirsky of the democratic initiative were 
apparently detained overnight uhl said 
the protests signal a growing frustration with the lack of social 
and economic reforms similiar to those implemented by president 
mikhail s gorbachev in the soviet union said dubcek who was 
ousted as his countrys leader for supporting the reforms that 
soviet troops crushed in 1968 
dubcek who lives in bratislava spoke about the current unrest 
in czechoslovakia in a telephone interview with the italian 
communist party daily lunita which carried a frontpage story on 
sunday 
there is a basic crisis that involves above all the young 
people the 20yearold children of the prague spring who have 
no future he was quoted as saying 
what young people are asking for is a rebirth of the type under 
way in the soviet union that involves even the party dubcek said

vigil for palach in wenceslas square police broke up the gathering 
with tear gas and truncheons and arrested 117 people

the supreme court dealing a serious blow to 
some forms of affirmative action today struck down a richmond va 
program aimed at helping construction industry businesses owned by 
minorities 
by a 63 vote the court ruled the plan is an unlawful form of 
reverse discrimination 
justice sandra day oconnor writing for the court said under 
richmonds scheme a successful black hispanic or oriental 
entrepreneur from anywhere in the country enjoys an absolute 
preference over other citizens based solely on their race 
we think it obvious that such a program is not narrowly 
tailored to remedy the effects of prior discrimination she said 
the richmond plan would require the prime contractor on any city 
building contract to subcontract at least 30 percent of the value of 
the project to firms that are at least onehalf minority owned 
oconnor said the 30 percent quota cannot be said to be 
narrowly tailored to any goal except perhaps outright racial 
balancing it rests upon the completely unrealistic assumption that 
minorities will choose a particular trade in lockstep proportion to 
their representation in the local population 
the ruling is expected to have farreaching impact on the use of 
socalled setaside programs by states and cities 
most states and more than 190 local governments have such 
programs according to a study by the minority business enterprise 
legal defense education fund 
the high court in recent years has upheld key affirmative action 
programs in other areas although always by narrow margins and with 
no clear consensus on how to evaluate their lawfulness 
in a stinging dissent today justice thurgood marshall said the 
richmond ruling marks a deliberate and giant step backward in this 
courts affirmative action jurisprudence cynical of one 
municipalitys attempt to redress the effects of past racial 
discrimination in a particular industry the majority launches a 
grapeshot attack on raceconscious remedies in general 
marshall said the harsh reality of todays ruling will be to 
discourage or prevent cities and states from acting to rectify the 
scourge of past discrimination 
he was joined by justices william j brennan and harry a 
blackmun 
oconnor drew a distinction between richmonds plan and one 
enacted by congress that the court upheld in 1980 the congressional 
plan required 10 percent of federal public works contracts be 
earmarked for minoritycontrolled businesses 
oconnor said richmond officials are not entitled to rely on a 
finding by congress that there has been nationwide discrimination in 
the construction industry 
also oconnor said the congressional setaside excused local 
governments from complying under certain conditions 
finally she said congress has unique powers in making a 
finding that past discrimination would cause federal funds to be 
distributed in a manner which reinforced prior pattenrs of 
discrimination 
while the states and their subdivisions may take remedial 
action when they possess evidence that their own spending practices 
are exacerbating a pattern of prior discrimination they must 
identify that discrimination public or private with some 
specificity before they may use raceconscious relief she said 
the richmond plan was challenged by building contractor ja 
croson co after it lost a city contract to install stainless steel 
urinals and water closets at the city jail croson did not include a 
minorityowned business as a subcontractor 
richmond officials adopted the affirmative action plan in 1983 
while the minorities named in the plan included hispanics 
orientals indians eskimos and aleuts the primary beneficiary 
would have been blacks 
richmonds population is about half black but the citys 
minorityowned businesses historically received less than 1 percent 
of the value of the citys public building contracts 
todays ruling upheld a decision by the 4th us circuit court of 
appeals based in richmond 
a coalition of groups representing local and state governments 
had said striking down the richmond plan would reopen old wounds and 
discourage affirmative action if it means governments first must 
admit past discrimination before adopting remedial programs 
in other action the court 
ruled that police do not need court warrants before searching 
from helicopters for marijuana growing in fencedin yards 
the court by a 54 vote said sheriffs deputies in pasco 
county fla did not violate anyones privacy rights five years ago 
when searching for marijuana from a helicopter hovering 400 feet 
above the ground 
ruled in a case stemming from the 1982 war over the falkland 
islands that argentina may not be sued in us courts for attacking 
a neutral oil tanker 
the 90 decision killed a suit against argentine officials by a 
foreign corporation engaged in us trade the former reagan 
administration urged the justices to throw out the suit 
refused to let a financially troubled utility company increase 
electric rates to help pay for a controversial nuclear power plant 
in seabrook nh 
the court citing the lack of a properly presented federal 
question left intact a new hampshire law barring rate hikes to 
pay for nuclear plant construction before the facilities are 
completed 
refused to shield new york from possibly paying part of the 
702000 award won by the family of a man who died 26 years ago in a 
secret army chemical warfare experiment 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that new york may 
be sued by federal officials seeking to force the state to help pay 
the award 
rejected an effort to preserve longshoremens jobs in the face 
of changing technology 
the court without comment let stand rulings that labor 
agreements between the international longshoremens association and 
shipping companies softening the impact of containerization at 
gulf and atlantic coast ports violate federal shipping law 
refused to hear an appeal by a pest control company ordered to 
roll back a fee increase it charged to more than 200000 customers 
nationwide 
the court without comment rejected arguments that orkin 
exterminating co acted in good faith in hiking renewal fees to 
produce more than 75 million in extra revenue 
refused to revive actress vanessa redgraves lawsuit against 
the boston symphony orchestra for canceling her performances 
following threats by protesters 
the court without comment let stand a 39500 
breachofcontract award won by ms redgrave but barred any 
additional damages based on claims that her civil and constitutional 
rights were violated

the supreme court in a case stemming from the 
1982 war over the falkland islands ruled today that argentina may 
not be sued in us courts for attacking a neutral oil tanker 
the 90 decision killed a suit against argentine officials by a 
foreign corporation engaged in us trade the former reagan 
administration had urged the justices to throw out the suit 
chief justice william h rehnquist writing for the court said 
argentina enjoys immunity from suit under a 1976 federal law the 
foreign sovereign immunity act 
nothing in the law permits a ship owner to sue over an injury 
on the high seas some 5000 miles off the nearest shores of the 
united states rehnquist said 
he also rejected arguments that treaties between argentina and 
the united states created an exception to the broad immunity granted 
by the 1976 law 
the case stems from an attack on the oil tanker hercules by 
argentine aircraft on june 8 1982 the ship was 600 miles from the 
argentina coast and nearly 500 miles from the falklands 
argentina and great britain were at war over control of the 
islands which argentina calls the malvinas 
the hercules was owned by united carriers inc and chartered by 
amerada hess shipping corp to carry oil from alaska around the 
southern tip of south america to a refinery in the us virgin 
islands 
united carriers and amerada hess are both liberian corporations 
the hercules was attacked despite a us alert to great britain 
and argentina that it was among neutral vessels traveling in the 
south atlantic 
the badly damaged tanker made it to port in rio de janeiro 
brazil but officials scuttled the ship on july 20 1982 because an 
unexploded bomb was embedded in one of its tanks 
united carriers sued argentina for 10 million for the destroyed 
tanker and amerada hess said it lost 2 million in fuel 
the suit was filed in federal court in new york city after 
argentine officials refused to consider the claims and the companies 
were unable to hire argentine attorneys to pursue a suit in that 
nations courts 
a federal judge threw out the suit but it was reinstated in 1987 
by the 2nd us circuit court of appeals 
former reagan administration officials argued that allowing the 
suit could have dire consequences for us foreign policy 
the case is argentine republic vs amerada hess 871372

an earthquake destroyed several mountain villages 
in tadzhikistan today killing up to 1000 people and burying one 
village under a 45foot wall of dirt and mud officials said 
almost everybody died said zainiddin nasreddinov 
editorinchief of the official tadzhikistan news agency who 
visited the buried village of sharora in soviet central asia 
a preliminary estimate indicated about 600 people died there he 
said in a telephone interview from dushanbe about 10 miles 
northeast of sharora the population of the village was not known 
but nasreddinov said about 70 families lived there 
the total number of deaths is now evaluated at up to 1000 
said the official tass news agency it said hundreds died in sharora 
but did not give an exact figure 
the quake struck about 1800 miles southeast of moscow north of 
afghanistan and bordering china at 202 am 602 pm est 
sunday it was the strongest quake to hit the soviet union since 
the dec 7 quake that struck armenia and killed about 25000 people 
rescue teams were searching for survivors and soldiers were 
rushed to the area to keep order and restore communications and 
power and water to the buildings left standing said nasreddinov 
roads into the area were damaged and thousands of head of cattle 
were killed tass said bulldozers and cranes were being sent into 
the area to help rescuers the report said 
the magnitude of the earthquake was uncertain 
the us geological survey in golden colo said it measured 60 
on the richter scale the survey offices in menlo park calif and 
reston va put the magnitude at 54 on the richter scale 
a torrent of dirt and mud slid from a nearby hill and buried 
sharora after the earthquake hit nasreddinov said 
everything is destroyed all the homes the schools the 
hospitals and clinics the stores he said communications 
electricity and water were disrupted and many injured were rushed to 
hospitals in dushanbe and other large cities 
tass said the quake caused destruction and casualties 
small buildings made from earth were hit especially hard 
tass said the quake caused a serious landslide some two 
kilometers 1 miles long from a hill near the village it said 
sharora was buried beneath 45 feet of mud and rocks 
nasreddinov said the buildings destroyed were all onestory 
structures made of brick he said soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev called tadzhikistan officials to promise help from the 
national government 
in addition to the deaths in sharora 70 more people were 
estimated to have died in the villages of akulibolo and akulipoyen 
near the epicenter according to nasreddinov he said several other 
villages were damaged 
local officials put the epicenter about 20 miles southwest of 
dushanbe the republics capital 
a quake of magnitude 6 on the richter scale can cause severe 
damage in populated areas a quake of magnitude 7 is considered a 
major earthquake capable of widespread heavy damage 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on a 
seismograph every increase of one number means that the ground 
motion is 10 times greater

the supreme court today let stand a california 
rule that virtually bans all lawyer advertisements featuring 
testimonials or client endorsements 
six months after the high court said it would use a challenge to 
the california rule to issue a decision that would bind all the 
states the justices dismissed the case 
the courts onesentence opinion said a los angeles lawyers 
appeal was being dropped for want of a properly presented federal 
question 
mark h oring of los angeles was reprimanded by the california 
bar association for a radio commercial in which a client who had 
been involved in an auto accident praised oring and his partner 
the client said that thanks to orings firm an insurance 
company paid her twice the amount of money she originally was 
awarded when her lawsuit went to trial 
state bar officials said the commercial inherently tended to 
confuse and mislead the public because it failed to explain that 
the clients case was highly unusual and that such doubling of 
awards in accident cases generally does not occur 
bar officials said the burden was on oring to prove the ad was 
truthful 
oring said the state rule presuming testimonials are deceptive 
violated his freespeech rights he said the rule has the effect of 
banning truthful ads 
the california supreme court rejected orings challenge to the 
rule in 1987 and todays action by the nations highest court 
leaves the state rule undisturbed 
the justices in 1977 ended the legal professions longtime ban on 
all lawyer advertising but left it to the states to ensure that ads 
are not deceptive 
the court said 12 years ago that lawyer advertising like other 
commercial speech is not constitutionally protected if found to be 
false or misleading 
in a series of decisions since the justices have forced states 
to relax certain restrictions on lawyer advertising such as a 
kentucky ban on directmail solicitation the court last year said 
states may not ban all directmail ads sent by lawyers to 
prospective customers 
orings partner david a grey also was reprimanded for the 
firms radio commercial and lost a similar appeal to the nations 
highest court in 1987 
the case is oring vs california 871224

aboutface on solidarity said the government needs compromise and 
support from the opposition and society at large to help pull the 
economy and people out from apathy helplessness and stillness 
the economic reform needs political backing not only from the 
government but also from the constructive opposition it needs 
social support sekula said in an interview published today by the 
official news agency pap 
there is no choice either we decide on actions forming a 
feasible chance of success or we reject them selecting defeat right 
from the start he said 
solidaritys statement of acceptance issued as its executive 
committee ended a twoday meeting was published by pap and 
broadcast as the first item on the national evening news 
the acceptance clears the way for the first formal talks between 
solidarity and the authorities since polands leader gen wojciech 
jaruzelski ended the union movements 16month legal existence with 
a december 1981 military crackdown interning thousands of union 
activists 
no date has been mentioned for the talks but both sides have 
indicated they could begin within a few weeks 
last week the countrys communist leaders offered the prospect 
of lifting the sevenyear ban on solidarity on the condition the 
movement forfeit western financial aid embrace socialism and agree 
to a twoyear moratorium on strikes 
the government that had for so long struggled to diminish 
solidaritys influence was now offering a partnership of sorts for 
tackling polands chronic economic and social ills 
though heartened by the offer wary solidarity activists said 
they suspected the government was seeking accord only to calm unrest 
caused by rising inflation and consumer shortages polands foreign 
debt is 39 billion 
i wish that there be no euphoria walesa cautioned the 
thousands of supporters after a mass at st brygidas roman catholic 
church anything is still possible 
is it true we will be solving polish problems in a pluralistic 
free way we will see very soon he said 
janusz onyszkiewicz solidaritys national spokesman said 
cooperation between the union movement and government now seems 
the only solution to polands crisis 
he rejected a strike ban but added we want to discuss 
economic reform if it works then there will be no need to have 
a general strike walesa has said he will not sign any agreement 
at the cost of solidaritys independence 
after sundays mass about 1000 people marched from the church 
chanting solidarity solidarity legalize solidarity police 
blocked the march after a few blocks and the group disbanded 
peacefully 
solidaritys statement sunday said that by agreeing to negotiate 
its reinstatement the government had met its conditions for 
beginning the talks authorities first proposed during a series of 
strikes in august 
we are responding stretching out our hand because the other 
side stretched out its hand too said walesa 
prime minister mieczyslaw rakowski on sunday said he could 
imagine solidarity one day becoming an opposition party but said 
the organization would have to renounce its status as a trade union 
to do so 
the question is what does solidarity want to become 
rakowski said in an interview with the west german zdf television 
network does it want to become an opposition political party or a 
trade union i would like to know 
he did not specify what scope or rights such an opposition party 
could have 
the statement from solidaritys 20member executive commission 
adopted unanimously with one abstention said it was necessary to 
start negotiations as soon as possible 
walesa told reporters that solidarity the only independent labor 
movement ever permitted in the soviet bloc could be ready within 
two months to hold its second nationwide congress the first was 
held in october 1981 
he also indicated the union movement might resume its weekly 
solidarity newspaper because without a press we would be 
nothing 
solidarity announced that a committee of three veteran union 
activists from the 1980 movement had been formed to prepare 
negotiations with the authorities they are zbigniew bujak 
wladyslaw frasyniuk and mieczyslaw gil 
gil an organizer at the nowa huta steelworks outside the 
southern city of krakow said he forsaw great difficulties and 
warned that the talks have been viewed as a panacea 
changing the model of the functioning of the polish economy 
is a major problem ahead gil said but whats most important is 
that pluralism was unblocked

american indians fed up with desecration of 
ancestral graves by artifact hunters are launching a campaign 
against international trading in indian bones and relics 
they come by the light of the moon they just ravage them 
dig them up organizer terry warren said if they are not the 
ones that collect bones they leave them scattered like a wild 
animal would after tearing away at the carcass 
more than 25 indian nations were represented sunday at religious 
ceremonies at looted burial sites followed by a meeting organized by 
the fledgling society against grave exploitations or sage said 
warren the groups executive director 
we are not going to stand for this any more said warren 38 
of osage and cherokee ancestry 
he said 75 american indians in a meeting with 200 nonindians 
decided to push for stronger federal laws against grave robbing 
which could be despoiling as many as 175000 burial sites a year 
we are putting aside our social and custom differences and 
going to attack this thing as a body of united peoples he said 
many wore traditional dress for the religious ceremonies held at 
the sites of over 40 holes that once were graves scattered 
throughout the area in southeastern illinois 
warren said participants included a ricaree sun dancer from st 
louis mo a choctaw from louisiana sioux from the dakotas 
cherokees from tennessee a seneca fom new york and comanches from 
oklahoma 
he said there is a nationwide network of grave robbers and the 
collectors they supply 
its everywhere in this country it involves mega megabucks 
maybe like money in the cocaine trade figures larger than people 
can even imagine warren said 
he said a ceremonial pipe can bring 500 to 1500 on the illegal 
market and a piece of pottery as much as 45000 warren said 
interest in the items appears especially strong now among west 
german and japanese collectors 
and in most states its pretty easy to get away with because of 
the lack of laws protecting our peoples graves warren 
said some states have passed laws making the practice a felony but 
in most a robber can only be charged with trespassing a 
misdemeanor that may carry a 50 fine he said 
looting graves on federal land is a felony 
elsewhere sunday an auction of indian artifacts at phelps ny 
drew complaints that the selling of artifacts encourages grave 
robbers 
i think theres a destruction of our ancestors in that act and 
theres a destruction of a historical record said peter jemison 
a seneca and director of a 300yearold seneca village state 
historic site at ganondagon ny near rochester one person 
comes in and lets his greed and theres no other word for it 
come before everything else 
if something was buried with an individual then it was a gift 
to them it was meant to stay with them forever jemison said he 
said he favors finding the original locations of the items when 
possible and reburying them with the people to whom they belong

east german leader erich honecker today announced 
his nation will reduce its armed forces by 10000 soldiers and 
reduce defense spending 10 percent 
honecker said that as part of the cutback six tank regiments and 
an air force squadron would be mustered out resulting in a 
reduction of 600 tanks and 50 warplanes 
at the same time the national outlay for defense will be 
reduced by 10 percent honecker said 
the surprise move follows an announcement by soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev last month that the kremlin was reducing its own 
troops including those stationed in eastern europe 
east germany has about 120000 soldiers 3000 main battle tanks 
and 350 combat aircraft according to estimates by the north 
atlantic treaty organization 
these decisions have been made made in order to make a further 
constructive contribution to disarmament honecker said in a 
speech during a reception for swedish prime minister ingvar carlsson 
it is done to show through actions our good will in reducing 
conventional forces and in the hope that other european nations will 
be inspired to do the same honecker added 
the communist leader said the tanks would either be destroyed or 
converted for civilian use he did not elaborate 
honecker said the cuts would be completed by the end of 1990 to 
give the east german army an even more defensive character 
gorbachev in a speech to the united nations in december said 
the soviets would be pulling 50000 men and 5000 tanks from east 
germany czechoslovakia and hungary over the next two years it is 
believed the soviets have 500000 troops in that region 
nato officials have welcomed gorbachevs initiative but maintain 
that the warsaw pact would still retain superiority in conventional 
forces in europe 
west german chancellor helmut kohl in a radio interview on sunday 
spoke out against a reduction in west german forces if there were no 
substantive changes in the european balance of military power 
eastwest negotiations on reducing conventional military forces 
in europe are slated to begin in march in vienna

the st lawrence seaway in 1988 finished its 
best shipping season in four years despite a 32 million ton drop in 
canadian grain shipments due to the summer drought 
a total of 405 million metric tons of cargo moved through the 
inland waterway in 1988 a gain of 561000 tons over 1987 seaway 
officials have said 
the seaway more than compensated for the decline in canadian 
grain by taking on higher tonnages of other bulk commodities such 
as chemicals and stone which set seaway records last year 
traditionally were viewed as a grain system but the system 
definitely is becoming more diversified and is being used for a much 
broader mix of cargo us seaway administrator james l emery 
said in a statement 
the waterway runs from duluth minn through the great lakes to 
the st lawrence river emptying into the atlantic it is jointly 
operated by the united states and canada 
last year was the third consecutive year of moderate total 
tonnage increases through the seaway emery said crediting 
marketing efforts and networking by the great lakes maritime 
industry including the international association of great lakes 
ports and state and privatesector groups 
while the tonnage of canadian grain shipped through the seaway 
fell 25 percent to 99 million metric tons us grain shipments 
climbed 8 percent to 55 million metric tons in 1988 last year was 
the second consecutive year that us grain tonnages have increased 
since a low in 1986 seaway officials said 
among reasons for increases in us grain shipments were a lower 
dollar larger us grain reserves increased us grain purchases 
by the soviet union and the us export enhancement program they 
said 
the decline in seaway grain shipments in 1988 was offset 
primarily by a 41 million ton increase in coal coke steel iron 
ore and selected bulk cargoes

a leading marxist theorist criticized in 1987 as 
too liberal said monday that authorities have barred newspapers from 
publishing a speech in which he called for greater academic freedom 
i believe what i said was true whether it is biting or not it 
should be said su shaozhi said in a telephone interview he said 
he has not been officially criticized for the speech in which he 
also declared marxism in china to be in a state of crisis 
su gave the speech in december at a forum called by the communist 
party propaganda department 
on dec 26 before the propaganda department barred the speech 
from publication the world economic herald published it the paper 
said monday that it had not suffered any political repercussions and 
denied rumors that its editor chen benli had been fired 
there is a rumor that chen will leave his job but there has 
been no official announcement an editor who identified himself 
only as su said in a telephone interview su is a common name and he 
was not related to su shaozhi 
however the editor said that many scholars have held meetings 
to discuss the speech and many people have come to the paper to 
talk to editors about it the herald has a reputation for publishing 
more daring views than other staterun newspapers 
su shaozhi 65 was fired in 1987 as head of the chinese academy 
of social sciences marxismleninismmao tsetung thought research 
institute he and several other intellectuals were accused of not 
being socialist enough and of being too fond of westernstyle 
democracy 
su was allowed to continue his reseach at the institute and kept 
his party membership but in his speech he criticized treatment of 
others who were stripped of their jobs and party membership in 1987 
and previously 
since the peoples republic was established we have had 34 
mass criticisms of natural scientists he said not one of the 
attacks has been correct science and culture have suffered serious 
damage he said the purges violated constitutional guarantees of 
academic freedom and the scientific spirit 
one of the reasons academic freedom has not been achieved is 
some leaders in theoretical circles call themselves marxists but 
actually use simplified dogmatic and ossified ideas from the 30s 
and 40s to decide what is right and wrong he wrote 
asked in the interview who he referred to su named hu qiaomu and 
deng liqun elderly conservatives who were forced later in 1987 to 
step down from their main party posts 
they continue to have influence su said but he said 
dogmatic interpretation of marxism including an emphasis on class 
struggle and centralization of authority began with revolutionary 
leader mao tsetung 
since maos death in 1976 the party has acknowledged he made 
mistakes and dropped his emphasis on class struggle but it 
continues periodic campaigns against liberalism 
su favors a freer interpretation of marxism that would allow for 
greater democracy and more private ownership

pope john paul ii has invited us bishops to 
submit topics they want to discuss with him at a special meeting in 
march a vatican official said monday 
the vatican announced earlier this month that 35 us archbishops 
will participate in talks in midmarch with the pope 
us churchmen had requested the meeting two years ago when many 
were concerned about the disciplining by the vatican of seattle 
archbishop raymond hunthausen a liberal 
on monday the vatican released a text of the popes jan 10 
letter to us bishops in which he told them he has set aside march 
811 to meet with them 
the pope told the bishops that it is my intention to reflect 
with you on an organic pastoral view of our episcopal ministry 
vatican spokesman joaquin navarro said the pope desired to talk 
openly to think together with the bishops about their role today 
he said the meeting will cover a mutually agreedupon agenda and 
that the vatican was waiting to receive the bishops suggestions 
last year at the annual session of the national conference of 
catholic bishops in washington differences surfaced between the 
vatican and the american side 
the bishops sent back a vatican draft document that questions the 
authority of national bishops conferences marking it as not 
suitable as a basis for discussion 
the popes jan 10 letter said the pastoral view must also 
express the indisputable priorities of the life of the church today 
both in her universal needs and in the special requirements of the 
church in the united states at the same time it must faithfully 
reflect the call of the second vatican council to reform and renewal 
as reiterated by the pope and bishops worldwide

surrendered four days later 
the only clashes reported during that insurrection were between 
troops and civilians many of whom harbor animosity toward the 
military 
on friday president alfonsin told a news conference that 
factions within the army still are angry over issues such as the 
prosecution of officers for human rights abuses committed during the 
197683 military dictatorship which he was elected in 1983 to 
replace 
i affirm categorically that those factions are not going to 
have the possibilities to triumph alfonsin said but i should 
say with absolute seriousness that i am not in the position of 
assuring with the same force and certainty that there will not be 
other episodes

most abortions im confident that more and more americans every 
year every day are hearing your message and taking it to heart

of maintaining a strict ethical code fitzwater said the president 
would shortly set up a commission to propose ways of strengthening 
ethics laws governing both administration officials and members of 
congress 
bush told his senior staff its not really very complicated 
its a question of knowing right from wrong avoiding conflicts of 
interest bending over backwards to see that theres no even a 
perception of a conflict of interest the new president said 
our actions must always be of the highest integrity

inaugural extravaganza 
he addressed the antiabortion protesters who gathered on the 
ellipse just south of the white house the demonstration was called 
to protest the supreme courts jan 22 1973 decision legalizing 
abortion 
reagan addressed the annual march and rally in the same fashion 
in previous years 
bush opposed a constitutional amendment banning abortions when he 
first ran for president in 1980 but later changed his position 
in his 1988 presidential campaign he voiced support for an 
amendment that would prohibit abortions except in cases of incest or 
rape or to save the life of the mother 
and as recently as his inaugural address on friday bush made a 
passing reference to the issue 
there he spoke of young women to be helped who are about to 
become mothers of children they cant care for and might not love 
they need our care our guidance and our education though we bless 
them for choosing life 
spokesman fitzwater said sunday the president will withhold 
specifics on his budget plans until a feb 9 address to a joint 
session of congress however he plans to start the ball rolling on 
tuesday when he meets with congressional leaders

it didnt cost much to keep muffin the 
cat at the putnam valley library food cat box litter an 
occasional rubber mouse maybe but letting her go has gotten very 
expensive 80000 so far 
dr john zarcone said sunday that he had dropped plans to 
contribute 50000 for a childrens audiovisual room at the library 
because muffin had been evicted 
earlier this month marjorie horton 94 a former putnam valley 
resident now living in new york city said she wrote a 30000 
bequest for the library out of her will over the incident 
muffin who had been living at the library since showing up on 
its doorstep seven years ago was evicted after a volunteer director 
said she was allergic to cats and could not work in the library 
peter grosewald chairman of the board of the privately run 
library said keeping the cat in another room didnt work and the 
director even offered to resign but the board decided that if 
keeping a cat meant someone could not go to the library the cat 
would have to go 
there also were allegations that muffin had swatted at some 
children without provocation but grosewald said the only issue 
is access we have to assure access to everybody 
even if it were a million dollars it would be a hard choice 
he said after mrs hortons decision 
grosewald said muffin has a good new home 
zarcone of putnam valley said he would find another 
organization for his 50000 mrs horton has said she will leave 
her money to three animal shelters

monday night ending a ninemonth separation from his wife and two 
children said simon who helped the man get permission to emigrate 
pyatetsky had not seen his brother mark since the brother left

joined mark pyatetsky in the united states in 1980 the senator said 
no family should ever have to endure what the pyatetsky family 
has gone through simon said we finally have a happy ending to 
a long sad and unnecessary story 
according to simon pyatetsky repeatedly applied for permission 
to emigrate and was denied each time for security reasons based on 
a clearance he received for a short period more than 15 years ago 
his wife sofia and children dmitry 14 and julia 5 were 
permitted to leave however they departed their home in kiev and 
arrived in illinois in april risking separation on the assumption 
that pyatetsky would follow them quickly 
simon a supporter of efforts to help jews leave the soviet union 
for new homes in the united states and israel joined mark pyatetsky 
and his parents sarra and michael in a prayer vigil on the capitol 
steps in 1986 
he also arranged for a meeting between members of the family and 
secretary of state george shultz in september 1988 to plead 
pyatetskys case and repeatedly contacted soviet officials on his 
behalf 
in november pyatetsky was told he could leave and should start 
preparing for his departure 
i applaud president mikhail s gorbachev for this trend 
toward freer emigration especially for soviet jews simon said 
we hope it continues

the soviet military on monday stepped 
up emergency airlifts to ease severe food shortages it blamed on 
hoarding and inefficiency by afghan authorities 
the local administration did not give out orders in time for 
when they needed to get food supplies said maj gen lev serebrov 
as troops hauled tons of flour off ilyushin76 cargo planes 
and some of the traders are not selling in order to raise 
prices he said there are enough supplies in the city but they 
are keeeping it to themsleves 
soviet officials said 400 to 500 tons of flour were arriving 
daily on a dozen flights from the soviet cities of tashkent and 
fergana both about an hour from kabul by plane 
the airlift began over the weekend and probably would continue 
through the week serebrov said 
the supplies had an immediate impact on the food shortage also 
blamed partly on disruption of road supply convoys by moslem 
guerrillas fighting the afghan government and the soviet troops 
lines at bread stores were shorter and in some cases disappeared 
but a severe shortage of fuel continued 
it was unclear whether the soviets would be able to mount food 
airlifts after they pull out of the capital as part of their 
withdrawal from afghanistan expected to be completed by feb 15 
the soviets say the impoverished city of 2 million people needs 
120 tons of flour a day but some afghan officials say it needs 500 
tons 
most soviet troops and their leaders are expected to leave kabul 
between jan 31 and feb 2 and head north up the 250mile salang 
highway this would leave aircraft more vulnerable to attacks by the 
guerrillas who are armed with rockets and antiaircraft missiles 
supplied by the united states and pakistan 
the guerrillas have been fighting the afghan government since the 
communists seized power in april 1978 and are expected to close in 
on president najibs marxist administration when the soviets leave 
about 50000 soviet troops pulled out in august under an 
agreement mediated by the united nations to end the soviet 
militarys nineyear intervention in the nation about 50000 troops 
remain 
the guerrillas are not a party to the un pact 
serebrov said the afghan army had set up a 12mile safety 
belt around the city to protect the airport 
the guerrillas rockets have a range of about 19 miles last 
week six rockets landed in the eastern part of the city near the 
airport killing four people and wounding nine 
helicopters clattered over the snowcovered mountains ringing the 
city as the transport planes landed and soldiers packed 
antimissile flares into metal holders on the planes fuselages 
before they took off 
in the city military truck convoys crawled through the streets 
carrying flour to staterun depots thousands more tons were crammed 
into a movie theaterturnedwarehouse at the soviet base 
troops who unloaded flour at the airport told western reporters 
that they had in the words of several fulfilled our duty to 
afghanistan and looked forward to going home 
fifteen soviet paratroopers gathered in a recreation room at the 
airport answered reporters questions with stiff terse replies 
the sad thing is that opposition groups here are fighting 
against their own people thats something ill never 
understand vladimir demimyaza a 21yearold private said when 
asked about his thoughts on 18 months of fighting the guerrillas 
the happy thing is that the afghan army has a lot of experience 
now theyve been taught i think to protect themselves on their 
own after we leave he said 
on the prospect of leaving maj valery kurilo said i wont 
miss it perhaps but ill always remember it 
serebrov denied the soviet withdrawal has resumed and has said 
that hundreds of fully equipped soviet troops who have been seen 
boarding transports have been replaced 
western diplomatic sources say the pullout began at the beginning 
of the month 
on monday six tanks accompanied by a 60vehicle convoy of 
troops and armored personnel carriers were seen heading north along 
the salang highway

dali will never die the artist said 15 years ago my soul 
will live on and on and i will keep creating and creating 
salvador dali described himself as being in a race with death to 
create as much as possible inevitably death caught him on monday 
at age 84 in figueras spain the catalonian town where he was born 
at the time of the interview with the associated press in 1974 
one of dalis projects was to have himself frozen just before he 
died and return at some future time 
he said he made long trips by sea because flying is ugly 
i have been on an airplane three times in my life and i will 
never fly again he said while a plane is in the air dali 
declared all colors on the ground jumble together and i dont 
like it 
the interview took place in new york shortly after he had created 
the hawaii suite of lithographs without having visited hawaii 
i have never been to any exotic country like hawaii but there 
was no need he said the reason is exoticism already existed 
in my mind inside my brain 
whatever his wealth and he was secretive about its extent 
dali claimed his most cherished possession was a small piece of 
driftwood he carried in his pocket tucked into an old tattered 
sock 
i picked this up on a beach in the mediterranean in 1931 while 
walking with my wife he said it represents all my love for 
her i value it more than any other thing in the world 
dali and gala dimitrovna diaharoff met in 1929 when she and her 
husband the french surrealist poet paul eluard visited the painter 
at his seaside home in northeastern spain 
at dalis request she never left and they married in 1958 six 
years after eluards death gala died in 1982

its harder to fall asleep or daydream 
during reading of the minutes of the 21st senate of the academic 
council at stanford university now that arthur coladarci is 
academic secretary 
out with such phrasing as the meeting was called to order by 
 
with coladarci wielding his pen the report reads chairman 
john kaplan rapped his gavel smartly at approximately 320 pm 
and all but an impish chemist responded appropriately but he 
complied cheerfully with kaplans personalized invitation to join 
the otherwise respectful assembly 
coladarci 71 a professor emeritus of psychology and education 
says that when he began writing the minutes last fall he set out to 
inject some fun into the official record of a body that decides a 
variety of academic issues 
i have never been comfortable with the general assumption that 
minutes ought to be sober things coladarci said meetings are 
not only sober occasions people are people and even the most 
serious discussions have in them a little irony a little humor 
coladarci certainly doesnt take himself too seriously as shown 
in this paragraph from the dec 1 minutes the senate tacitly gave 
its secular absolution to the academic secretary for the venial 
misspelling of tendentious in the draft version of the nov 10 
minutes 
nel noddings a professor of education gave coladarci high 
praise for minutes he kept for the school of education 
the minutes were always read

the commodity futures trading commission 
acknowledged for the first time today that it has worked with the 
fbi from the beginning of an investigation into fraud at the 
nations two largest futures exchanges 
the federal commission regulates the commodities markets as the 
securities and exchange commission monitors the stock and bond 
markets 
cftc spokeswoman kate hathaway declined to provide specifics of 
the commissions role in probing allegations of profit skimming from 
investors but said a statement would be issued after the markets 
closed 
meanwhile commodities traders were reported scrambling for 
attorneys as federal authorities continued the investigation into 
trading practices at the chicago board of trade and the chicago 
mercantile exchange 
the investigation centers on allegations that as many as 100 
brokers and traders systematically cheated customers out of millions 
of dollars 
the undercover sting operation became public thursday when 
federal agents began serving traders brokerage firms and the 
exchanges with subpoenas the result was panic in many trading 
circles 
the chicago tribune reported sunday that the fbi launched the 
probe following a complaint by the archer daniels midland co a 
decaturbased grainprocessing company of possible violations 
former us attorney dan webb now a lawyer in private practice 
said he returned to his office thursday night after a day in court 
to find 10 messages from traders seeking a lawyer 
some traders are probable defendants others may be concerned 
about the prospect of civil lawsuits from investors who have lost 
money in the futures markets and seek to blame their losses on 
corrupt trading practices 
lawyers interviewed by the tribune said the most likely defenses 
would involve the fidelity of government taperecordings secretly 
made on noisy exchange floors and questioning whether the fbi has 
the expertise to spot crime in the futures business 
us attorney general dick thornburgh indicated sunday in 
washington that authorities were preparing to present evidence to a 
grand jury 
obviously i cant discuss in detail whats a pending 
investigation thornburgh said on nbctvs meet the press 
but the investigation is farreaching it is significant we 
will be gathering and submitting evidence to see if violations of 
the federal criminal laws have occurred 
in the twoyear probe fbi agents posing as traders recorded 
conversations that suggested some trades were rigged to prevent 
customers from getting fairmarket prices and that some brokers 
sent false reports to customers to hide the skimming of profits or 
overcharges on commissions the tribune and chicago suntimes have 
said 
commodities exchanges are marketplaces in which buyers and 
sellers essentially bet millions of dollars on the future prices of 
goods ranging from gold to frozen orange juice

many cooperatives founded under a law to encourage 
competition are finding it too easy to charge big prices and pay 
high wages and need to be controlled a kremlin official said 
monday 
they make money without earning it by just raising prices 
said alexandra biryukova a candidate member of the ruling communist 
party politburo and a deputy premier 
the government last month moved to cut cooperatives out of some 
lucrative businesses such as medical services and video salons and 
is trying to control their prices 
mrs biryukova made her comments at a news conference as members 
of cooperatives were preparing for conferences to provide a national 
framework for their movement 
a weekly newspaper reported last week that there are 48500 
cooperatives in the soviet union that employ more than 770000 
people they produced about 4 billion in goods and services or 
about 1 percent of the national total according to the newspaper 
arguments and facts 
mrs biryukova who oversees the production of consumer goods in 
the official staterun economy said in some cases cooperatives have 
proven to be much less efficient than staterun enterprises 
in the manufacture of clothing the output per person in 
cooperatives is six to seven times lower than that of state 
enterprises yet wages of coop workers are two to three times 
higher than the minimum for a state worker she said 
permitted to exist outside the official economy to spur 
efficiency and to fill holes in the range of products and services 
provided by the official economy the cooperatives have been free 
from state price controls 
many state enterprises would like to be in the same situation 
as cooperatives she said 
but earlier this month the politburo called for the creation of 
conditions that would improve the quality and output of goods 
produced by cooperatives while bringing their prices closer to state 
prices 
for instance the government now is seeking to bring the prices 
at cooperative restaurants among the most popular cooperative 
ventures down to the level of the best staterun restaurants she 
said 
a meal at an expensive cooperative might cost about 32 to 48 
per person but would likely not exceed 16 at a staterun 
restaurant 
mrs biryukova denied the state was trying to drive cooperatives 
out of business and said limitations on activities such as 
providing medical services were meant to protect the public 
leaders of the cooperative movement said last week they doubted 
the government would be able to put medical cooperatives and video 
salons out of business that would require officials to buy out the 
coops high initial investments and operating costs they said

monday to a rally of antiabortion protesters bush addressed the 
group from the oval office through a telephone hookup that was piped 
to the rally 
good afternoon ladies and gentlemen this is george bush in the 
oval office and before you begin your march today on this first 
monday of my presidency i wanted to take just a few brief moments 
to restate my firm support of our cause and to share with you my 
deep personal concern about our american tragedy of 
abortionondemand we are concerned about abortion because it deals 
with the lives of two human beings mother and child i know there 
are people of good will who disagree but after years of sober and 
serious reflection on the issue this is what i think i think the 
supreme courts decision in roe versus wade was wrong and should be 
overturned i think america needs a human life amendment and i 
think when it comes to abortion there is a better way the way of 
adoption the way of life 
i know that this morning several of your leaders had a meeting 
in the white house with vice president quayle i know too that you 
and hundreds of thousands with you across the country have raised a 
voice of moral gravity about abortion a voice of principle a voice 
of faith a full voice that properly asserts and affirms the basic 
dignity of human life im confident that more and more americans 
every year every day are hearing your message and taking it to 
heart and ladies and gentlemen and yes young people as well i 
promise you that the president hears you now and stands with you in 
a cause that must be won 
good bless you all and god bless life

the former chief actuary of the social security 
system said monday that raising the benefits paid to notch 
babies millions of americans born from 1917 through 1921 who 
complain they have been treated unfairly would itself be an 
inequity 
robert j myers generally acknowledged as the nations utmost 
authority on social security told congress it should not pass 
legislation to redress such complaints 
the multibilliondollar problem a sideeffect of major social 
security bills in 1972 and 1977 refers to a situation in which two 
retirees who worked the same number of years for the same wages can 
receive different social security benefits just because they were 
born a year or two apart 
there are an estimated 7 million notch babies 
myers who chaired a private panel created to examine the 
problem told the senate finance subcommittee on social security 
the real problem is that those persons who were born before 
1917 and who worked well beyond age 62 after 1978 receive undue 
windfalls those born after 1916 are equitably treated consistent 
with the intent of congress and receive proper benefit amounts 
myers said there was no reason why younger workers should over 
the years pay more taxes to provide windfall benefits to this 
group 
and he said that while there is a case for reducing the 
windfall benefits for some persons born before 1917 this would not 
now be equitable 
the congressional general accounting office and two organizations 
representing millions of older americans the american association 
of retired persons and the national council of senior citizens 
agreed with myers 
to focus on the unwarranted demands of one small group of 
beneficiaries could threaten the fsical soundness of social 
security thereby affecting everyone said eugene lehrmann of 
madison wis vice chairman of aarp 
a third group representing retirees disagreed the national 
committee to preserve social security and medicare said the panel 
chaired by myers produced a biased report that gives congress little 
guidance on correcting the problem 
we are concerned that you and your colleagues have 
underestimated the damage to the integrity of the social security 
system that the notch and the failure to correct it has caused 
said bruce sumner a director of the national committee 
the myers commission was created by the national academy for 
social insurance a nonprofit nonpartisan group that says its 
mission is to further knowledge of social security 
since the notch problem first came to light dozens of bills have 
been introduced in congress to correct it some would cost the 
social security trust fund as much as 200 billion over 10 years by 
raising retirement benefits for those born from 1917 through 1921 
others would reduce benefits of some recipients who were not born 
during that period 
the problem was created in 1977 when congress cut back a 
toogenerous costoflivingallowance formula enacted in 1972 the 
new formula was phased in and affected those born from 1917 through 
1921 
the most obvious result of the change was to give sometimeslarge 
benefit increases to people born in the years just before that 
period many notch babies are upset that fellow retirees born a 
year or two earlier receive much bigger checks then they do 
sometimes the disparity can be as much as 100 a month in many 
cases retirees born after 1921 may be entitled to a greater benefit 
than those in the 191721 group but myers insisted that this 
disparity is negligible

the senate governmental affairs committee today 
approved the nomination of richard darman to be president bushs 
budget director paving the way for a full senate vote on wednesday 
the committee voted 90 for darman to be director of the white 
houses office of management and budget 
sen john glenn dohio the committees chairman said he knew 
of nothing that would prevent the senate from confirming darman 
darman 45 is a former investment banker deputy treasury 
secretary and white house aide 
darman refused to provide specific information on how the deficit 
would be reduced in the fiscal 1990 budget that bush plans to 
present to congress on feb 9 
i have what amounts to an extemely long laundry list of 
possibilities darman told the lawmakers almost everything on 
the laundry list is unattractive to some constitutency 
the only hint of detail darman would provide was to repeat 
earlier promises by bush that social security which totals nearly 
onefifth of the l1 trillion federal budget would not be cut 
and that there will be no new taxes 
we are firm and have to be on the no new taxes point 
darman said 
the grammrudman balanced budget law requires a deficit next year 
of no more than 100 billion the administration says that without 
any savings the imbalance will be 127 billion

armed civilians seized a small 
military base near the capital today and at least six people were 
killed before soldiers were able to retake most of the facility 
news reports and officials said 
the civilian attackers stormed the base carried pamphlets 
supporting officers who have led three previous uprisings the 
private news agency diario y noticias said 
soldiers firing tank shells mortars and heavy machine guns 
regained control of most of the base a few hours later but held off 
on a final assault because of concerns some hostages were being held 
inside the staterun telam news agency said quoting unidentified 
military sources 
soldiers and buenos aires provincial police backed by tanks 
reportedly surrounded several buildings where the civilian fighters 
were holed up 
under a hazy summer sun two small tanks opened the noon 
counterattack firing on the officers club in which the civilians 
were thought to be isolated telam said sporadic shooting continued 
several hours 
provincial government and police sources said four soldiers were 
killed and eight soldiers or police wounded at least two civilian 
fighters were killed dyn reported 
earlier news reports said three civilians and two police were 
killed it was not clear if the later reports included these 
casualties 
the ministry of defense anticipating a possible fourth 
insurrection against the government in the past 21 months bolstered 
defenses at government house and the official residence of president 
raul alfonsin telam said 
the civilian president spoke by telephone with defense minister 
horacio jaunarena and army chief gen francisco gassino and told 
them to retake the base presidential press secretary jose ignacio 
lopez told reporters 
buenos aires provincial police surrounded it began to evacuate 
nearby residents and took up firing positions in private homes 
the incident comes less than two months after a shortlived 
barracks insurrection to protest alfonsins treatment of the 
military 
the seizure occurred at the 3rd infantry regiment at la tablada 
12 miles northwest of the capital buenos aires 
defense ministry officials made no comment and the precise number 
of civilians involved or soldiers at the base was not known 
the attack began about 3 am when civilians threw several small 
explosive devices onto the base compound dyn reported 
employees at a nearby gas station said that at about 615 am 
civilians in a truck crashed through the regiments main gate dyn 
said six cars followed 
a total of 40 to 50 men and women dressed in civilian clothes 
were in the truck and cars news agencies reported police put the 
number at about 30 
according to dyn as they entered the base the civilians threw 
pamphlets supporting what is known as the new argentine army of 
lt col aldo rico who led shortlived army uprisings in april 1987 
and january 1988 rico was dismissed and now is in prison 
other pamphlets read long live rico and long live 
seineldin dyn reported col mohamed ali seineldin led a fourday 
uprising in december he also is in prison 
the base was almost empty at the time of the attack the news 
agencies reported they said most officers and noncommissioned men 
had left for the weekend and had not returned 
the december insurrection began after officers at several army 
bases including la tablada tried to incite troops seineldin 
surrendered four days later 
the only clashes reported during that insurrection were between 
troops and civilians many of whom harbor animosity toward the 
military 
on friday president alfonsin told a news conference that 
factions within the army still are angry over issues such as the 
prosecution of officers for human rights abuses committed during the 
197683 military dictatorship which he was elected in 1983 to 
replace 
i affirm categorically that those factions are not going to 
have the possibilities to triumph alfonsin said but i should 
say with absolute seriousness that i am not in the position of 
assuring with the same force and certainty that there will not be 
other episodes

us allies especially japan should raise 
their defense spending even as the united states throttles back from 
recent rises in the growth rate of its defense budget says a 
private group that includes three former defense secretaries and 
president bushs national security adviser 
japan clearly should increase its expenditures on international 
security but those increases should lie principally in economic 
assistance and in support of the costs of us forces in japan 
they said adding 
realistic expectations are that at most us defense spending 
will remain flat for the foreseeable future 
the bipartisan group included former secretaries of defense 
harold brown melvin laird and james schlesinger as well as former 
secretary of state cyrus vance financier felix rohatyn and brent 
scowcroft bushs national security adviser 
their recommendations were published recently under the title 
building a new consensus by the school of advanced international 
studies sais of the johns hopkins university in the semiannual 
sais review 
brown who like vance served under president carter is chairman 
of the group laird and schlesinger served under president nixon 
rohatyn is also a member of the 14member national economic 
commission due to make a a major report to bush and congress by 
march 1 
browns group suggested that the united states will have to 
increase federal revenues to adequately meet its commitments 
adequate resources exist to provide both necessary social 
services and an adequate defense but it serves no constructive 
purpose to pretend that sacrifices are unncessary to secure them or 
that the american people can get deficit reduction adequate 
defense increased social spending and tax reduction all at the same 
time they said

a man who said he posed as an american indian 
because he was fascinated by their culture actually thought indian 
women should be killed a prosecutor said monday in opening 
arguments for a triple murder trial 
but a lawyer for billy glaze charged in the deaths of three 
american indian women questioned whether one person killed all 
three women and said glaze was charged only because of pressure on 
the police department 
this case is about three young sad troubled lives three 
vulnerable women all of whom had their lives taken their lives 
snuffed out abbreviated by the violent senseless action of their 
killer assistant hennepin county attorney judith hawley said in 
her opening statement 
hawley said prosecutors would present evidence that glaze 
admitted killing the women in a note to a fellow prisoner that said 
i killed them i was mad at them 
witnesses will testify that glaze hated american indian women and 
thought they should be raped and killed she said 
defense lawyer michael j colich questioned the reliability of 
prosecution witnesses and the length of time between glazes 
identification as a suspect and his indictment 
glaze 44 is charged with murder in the deaths of three women 
from july 1986 to april 1987 he is being held in lieu of 2 million 
bail 
police believe the three victims met their killer in bars their 
bodies were mutilated and posed in suggestive positions after their 
deaths 
all 12 of the police departments homicide detectives were put on 
the case when the third body was discovered 
investigators identified glaze as their prime suspect months 
before he was indicted june 14 authorities said they were hampered 
initially by a lack of hard evidence and potential witnesses who 
wouldnt cooperate used aliases or had no addresses 
there has been a lot of time spent on the police 
investigation not necessarily that theyve turned up a lot because 
of that time said attorney peter cahill colichs cocounsel 
from the very beginning billy glaze has always denied any 
involvement with any of the deaths 
glaze is believed to have left minneapolis around may 1 1987 
he was arrested may 24 1987 on a drunken driving charge in new 
mexico albuquerque police contacted minneapolis authorities when 
they learned glaze was sought for questioning in the three killings 
albuquerque authorities said glazes truck contained a 
bloodstained shirt a bloody nightstick and strands of human hair 
stuck to a crowbar 
from albuquerque glaze was transferred to dallas for violating 
conditions of his parole from a 1974 rape conviction shortly before 
he was to be released in december 1987 federal officials in 
minneapolis charged him with two counts of social security fraud 
a grand jury that heard testimony from 50 witnesses deliberated 
less than an hour before indicting glaze two weeks later he was 
convicted of the fraud charges and sentenced to two years in prison 
and five years probation 
glaze once told a television reporter that he had claimed to be 
an indian because their culture fascinated him and federal 
authorities said he used aliases including jesse settingcrow and 
jesse sitting crow

the us customs service said monday it seized 
almost 23 tons of cocaine in the past three months including drugs 
hidden in shipments of beeswax and anchovies 
the 45530 pounds of cocaine seized between oct 1 and dec 31 
was 11276 pounds more than in the same period one year earlier an 
increase of about onethird said customs spokesman dennis shimkoski 
a lot of it is coming in by ship he said sometimes its 
in hollowedout lumber weve found it in shipments of beeswax 
fruit pulp industrial gear boxes anchovies and false walls of 
containers 
shimkoski said sometimes bags of cocaine were secreted in huge 
containers of items such as fruit pulp but other times the 
substance was just mixed in with the legitimate cargo and would have 
to be cooked out later 
with the technology that they use the skys the limit on what 
theyll try next he said 
cocaine inside chocolates bulk lumber and wooden boards in 
containers came from central and south america last year those 
three shipments together yielded more than 20000 pounds of cocaine 
he said 
the cocaine in the beeswax and other bulk cargo was found through 
the automated commercial system in which computers compare cargo 
manifests to find who the highrisk importers might be or the 
highrisk imports shimkoski said 
for the entire 1988 fiscal year which ended last sept 30 
customs officers found a record 138808 pounds of cocaine up from 
87898 pounds in fiscal 1987 and 52521 pounds in fiscal 1986 he 
said 
the drug enforcement administration has estimated that cocaine 
production overseas colombia peru bolivia and ecuador are main 
producers is decreasing in fiscal 1989 
this would mean said dea spokesman maurice hill that the big 
increase in seizures by customs in the first quarter of fiscal 1989 
reflected an actual cut in the amount of cocaine coming in not just 
a cut in a much larger supply 
without a doubt its a cut in imports hill said but you 
realize with the numbers were dealing with its not a dent 
meanwhile the customs services 21 international mail branches 
seized record quantities of other drugs heroin opium and 
marijuana shimkoski said 
those branches seized 164 pounds of heroin last year compared 
with just 23 pounds in fiscal 1987 he said meanwhile opium 
seizures increased from 1019 pounds to 1600 pounds and marijuana 
seizures increased from 1141 to 1310 pounds

militarily the situation at the 3rd infantry regiment at la 
tablada is dominated the secretary for state intelligence

the december insurrection began after officers at several army 
bases including la tablada tried to incite troops seineldin 
surrendered four days later 
the only clashes reported during that insurrection were between 
troops and civilians many of whom harbor animosity toward the 
military 
on friday president alfonsin told a news conference that 
factions within the army still are angry over issues such as the 
prosecution of officers for human rights abuses committed during the 
197683 military dictatorship which he was elected in 1983 to 
replace 
i affirm categorically that those factions are not going to 
have the possibilities to triumph alfonsin said but i should 
say with absolute seriousness that i am not in the position of 
assuring with the same force and certainty that there will not be 
other episodes

starke fla ap convicted murderer ted bundy facing execution 
in less than 24 hours for the slaying of a florida schoolgirl met 
with his attorneys and a psychiatrist today and was in a subdued 
mood a prison official said 
bundys attorneys also filed a lastditch appeal with the us 
supreme court where they were turned down last week 
the convicted murderers appointment with a psychiatrist today 
generated speculation that the suspect in up to three dozen slayings 
will try to halt his execution through a competency claim 
today his attorneys also filed an appeal with florida circuit 
judge john peach in lake city arguing that a 1980 trial jury 
received improper instructions about their role in bundys 
sentencing peach rejected the appeal according to larry spaulding 
director of the office of the capital collateral representative the 
state agency that represents death row inmates 
bundys attorneys then notified the florida supreme court that it 
would be asked to consider the argument said court clerk sid white 
the appeal was filed today after gov bob martinez late sunday 
reaffirmed his vow that he has no intention of delaying the 
execution beyond tuesday morning said jon peck the governors 
press secretary 
bundy is scheduled for execution at florida state prison on 
tuesday for the 1978 rape and murder of a 12yearold lake city 
girl one of three people bundy killed in florida bunday is under 
his fourth death warrant 
meanwhile bundy has confessed to 20 killings in four western 
states officials said 
bundy planned to meet this afternoon with representatives of the 
colorado state attorney generals office to discuss murders in that 
state said bob macmaster prison spokesman bundy also was to meet 
with california tv minister james dobson macmaster said 
during the past four days bundy has admitted killing 20 young 
women in washington utah idaho and colorado authorities said 
salt lake county sheriffs detective dennis couch said sunday 
night that bundy mentioned his involvement in up to eight utah 
killings at least two more than authorities had believed 
earlier sunday bundy confessed to two murders in idaho where 
officials had never linked him to any killings 
he also provided investigators friday and saturday with details 
of eight washington killings and one in colorado for which he has 
long been suspected but never charged authorities said they said 
he provided details of a colorado killing in which he had been 
charged 
colorado attorney general duane woodard criticized bundys new 
cooperation accusing the killer of stringing along investigators to 
avoid execution 
florida attorney general bob butterworth said bundy was a 
conniver but that his tactics wouldnt work this time 
woodard who discussed bundy confessions at length with 
washington state attorney general ken eikenberry on saturday night 
said bundy has failed to give investigators from either state much 
new information 
he picks out one woman in colorado and one woman in washington 
state just to whet the appetite of law enforcement said woodard 
who called bundys 11thhour statements a hoax 
i am disappointed that in his closing hours when he had the 
opportunity to inform authorities of the whereabouts of bodies he 
didnt do it 
in addition to the appeal to the supreme court bundys attorneys 
also could ask martinez for a stay on grounds that bundy wouldnt 
understand the charges against him or the severity of the sentence 
at the time of execution 
if and when that claim is raised it would require the governor 
to stay the execution and appoint a team of three psychiatrists to 
interview bundy which we are fully prepared to do if the need 
arises peck said 
the key here is timing but the end result will be the same it 
could slow down the process but the sentence is going to be carried 
out and its going to be carried out very soon 
i guess they figure it aint over till its over 
bundys attorneys worked late sunday 
bundy who has been on death row at the prison since july 1979 
and survived three death warrants lost an appeal to the us 
supreme court a week ago and no other court has offered a reprieve 
if all appeals fail final preparations for execution would begin 
tonight 
in tacoma wash where bundy was raised word of the confessions 
shocked his mother louise 
if ted did do these things and if indeed he is substantiating 
it with facts that he really did those things oh its the 
most devastating news of our lives she said shaking her head and 
sighing as her husband john sat silently across the room 
thomas leach whose 12yearold daughter kimberly was bundys 
last victim doubted the execution would proceed saying they 
aint going to do nothing 
but kimberlys uncle frank fender has asked to attend the 
execution despite state policy barring victims relatives as 
witnesses 
i want to look in his eyes and see him before they put the hood 
on fender said referring to the dark hood placed over an 
inmates shaven head just before electrocution 
brian ballard the governors chief of operations said the 
governors office planned to talk with fender however he said the 
rules wouldnt be set aside to accommodate witness requests

a meat industry association said monday it has 
asked the agriculture department to delay proposed changes in 
regulations designed to ensure the safety of certain kinds of meat 
patties including precooked hamburgers 
the american meat institute said in a letter to the departments 
food safety and inspection service that the 30day public comment 
period allowed by the dec 27 proposal was not enough to 
appropriately address the specifics of the proposed rule change 
in announcing the proposal agency administrator lester m 
crawford had said there had been increasing evidence over the past 
several years that foodborne pathogens survive in products that 
many consumers erroneously consider to be fully cooked 
crawford said the products include such items charbroiled beef 
patties and prebrowned fresh pork sausage patties 
recently he said a bacterial strain was linked to an outbreak 
of food poisoning which hospitalized six minnesota school children 
with severe diarrhea and cramps 
crawford said the centers for disease control determined that 
undercooked beef patties caused the illness although the specific 
bacterial strain that infected the children has not been isolated 
from the patties 
the proposed rule would establish requirements for the storage of 
raw ingredients processing times and temperatures handling to 
prevent contamination after processing and labels that include 
cooking instruction for final preparation 
crawford said that a label for partially cooked ground meat 
patties for example would bear the statement partially cooked 
for safety cook until well done internal temperature of 160 f 
george d wilson the meat institutes vice president of science 
and prepared meats said in the letter to the federal agency that 
contrary to suggestions in the proposal ami fails to see the 
grounds for associating a public health emergency with the 
production and consumption of precooked meat patties 
wilson said the agriculture department laboratory tests did not 
confirm the presence of the specific bacteria implicated in the 
minnesota incident 
wilson said the institute believes the proposal was hastily 
prepared using an associated but inappropriate data base resulting 
in a proposed regulation which is a product safety overkill and is 
commercially impractical

this years march for life to protest legalized 
abortion comes at a time when the supreme court is considering new 
limits on the constitutional right it granted women 16 years ago 
and although what prochoice forces term a womans right to 
control her body may not be in jeopardy prolife forces are 
hoping the court will significantly dent what they call abortion on 
demand 
removed from but not unaware of the political battle being 
waged outside its stately edifice the court is studying a missouri 
law that makes abortions more difficult to obtain in that state 
lower courts invalidated the law and state officials want it 
reinstated if the law runs afoul of the courts landmark roe vs 
wade decision legalizing abortion says the missouri appeal under 
study its the 1973 ruling that should give way 
arguments in the case will be heard sometime in the spring and a 
decision is expected by july 
over the years most recently in 1983 and in 1986 the court 
has resisted state attempts to add muscle to their 
abortionregulating powers some of the invalidated measures are 
similar to those proposed in missouri 
but the courts membership has changed since its last major 
ruling on abortion rights adding new drama and the potential for 
a differing result to the missouri case 
many constitutional law experts predict the current court will 
not retreat from its 1973 finding that women have a fundamental 
constitutional right based on privacy to end their pregnancies 
but those experts say the justices may be willing to alter the 
1973 guidelines dictating how state and local governments may 
interfere with that right at stake is the scope of availability of 
legal abortions which now number about 15 million a year 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justice byron r white 
dissented from the roe vs wade ruling and several subsequent 
abortion decisions 
justice sandra day oconnor has questioned the reasoning of the 
1973 ruling 
justice antonin scalia who has not yet voted in an abortion 
decision since being named to the court by thenpresident reagan in 
1986 is thought to favor overturning or curtailing roe vs wade 
justice anthony m kennedy another reagan appointee who joined 
the court last february likewise has not participated in an 
abortion case his views on roe vs wade are not known 
justices harry a blackmun william j brennan thurgood marshall 
and john paul stevens are seen as staunch supporters of the 1973 
decision and the trimesterbytrimester approach it took in limiting 
governmental regulation of abortion 
the decision said a womans decision to have an abortion during 
the first three months of pregnancy must be left to her and her 
doctor 
it said states may interfere in the abortion decision during the 
second trimester only to protect the womans health and may take 
steps only to protect fetal life in the third trimester state 
authority to regulate abortions after the first trimester was not 
made absolute however 
the justices knew the trimester approach they adopted was in many 
respects arbitrary according to internal court memoranda unearthed 
and published this week by the washington post 
blackmun author of the 1973 decision told a law school audience 
last september that roe vs wade could be overturned this year 
theres a very distinct possibility that it will this term 
you can count the votes he said 
for blackmun the continuing controversy generated by the 1973 
decision has become a personal emotional matter his statement 
therefore may be discounted as something less than an actual 
prediction 
but the courts decision in the missouri case whether or not it 
disturbs roe vs wade is destined to become at least temporarily 
the new watershed in what likely is a neverending debate over 
abortion

president bush told tens of thousands of 
demonstrators today that abortion on demand is an american 
tragedy and said he favors reversal of the landmark supreme court 
decision legalizing it 
speaking by telephone hookup to activists gathered near the white 
house on the 16th anniversary of the historic roe vs wade decision 
bush said he believes that ruling was wrong and should be 
overturned 
the new president made the call shortly after vice president dan 
quayle also assured antiabortion leaders that the new 
administration supports their cause 
i wanted to share with you my deep personal concern about our 
american tragedy abortion on demand bush said 
i think america needs a human life amendment and i think when 
it comes to abortion theres a better way the way of adoption 
the way of life he said adding 
im confident that more and more americans every year every 
day are hearing your message and taking it to heart i promise you 
that the president hears you now and stands with you in a cause that 
must be won god bless you all and god bless life 
although the protestors cheered bush with enthusiasm nellie gray 
of the march for life an organizer of the rally cautioned the 
crowd on the ellipse off the white house grounds that although 
they could see the white house and hear bush he could not hear them 
unfortunately the white house staff chose to put in a oneway 
communications line she said he spoke to us but he could not 
hear us that was not an adequate way to deal with our prolife 
march 
former president reagan followed the same practice as bush in 
past years 
us park police estimated that 67000 people attended the rally 
held in sunny mild weather 
talking to antiabortion leaders earlier quayle noted that i 
have been involved with a lot of people in my state indiana on 
this issue i couldnt think of a more appropriate group to be 
meeting with 
the noontime rally and a march to capitol hill culminated a 
series of nationwide protests against the supreme courts 1973 roe 
vs wade decision that legalized abortion 
john c willke president of the national right to life 
committee told reporters earlier that a nonsectarian campaign of 
prayer is needed to help stop todays holocaust 
willke gave no details saying individuals will have to work out 
what is comfortable for them 
all we can do is plant a seed and call for it he said but 
i see tens of thousands of pastors tens of thousands points of 
light on a prayer crusade 
quayle said he was delighted to sit down with various 
constituencies interested in the preservation of life 
when a reporter asked whether the bush administration could 
succeed in getting the roe vs wade decision reversed quayle 
replied time will tell we have the same commitment he said it 
was important that someone stand up and speak for those people who 
are not yet born 
white house chief of staff john sununu accompanied quayle to the 
meeting and the vice president said sununu was there because he 
wanted to hear the visitors views 
willke said he had no problem meeting with the vice president 
instead of the president and said he believes bush will probably 
walk in ronald reagans mocassins on this issue 
leonard dinegar of the national right to life committee said 
organizers hoped to match last years turnout of 50000 people for 
what has become an annual reminder of the divisive issue 
the debate has taken on added intensity this year with a 
reconstituted supreme court considering a missouri case with the 
potential to result in significant changes in the legal doctrine 
governing abortion 
the washington protest capped a series of demonstrations marking 
the 16th anniversary of the roe vs wade decision declaring that 
womens privacy rights allow them to make their own decisions on 
abortion 
antiabortion demonstrators marched by the thousands in numerous 
cities on sunday in some cases confronted by advocates of free 
choice in abortion 
more than 500 opponents of abortion were met at a planned 
parenthood office in burlington vt by 40 prochoice demonstrators 
the two sides faced each other from across the street with each 
group singing clapping and maintaining their distance 
righttolife is not a political issue said bishop john 
marshall the leader of vermonts catholic diocese it is not a 
matter for the politicians to decide it is a religious and moral 
issue already decided by god 
in downtown pittsburgh about 1200 prochoice marchers joined a 
march for womens lives they were met at the allegheny county 
morgue by about 40 antiabortion marchers 
the prochoice march was preceded by a rally at which eleanor 
smeal a former national organization for women president said 
some people want to save their souls by spilling the blood of 
innocent women that isnt christianity its hypocrisy the church 
has no business dictating the policies of this country 
after her remarks many in the crowd turned shook their fingers 
and yelled shame shame shame at the antiabortion protesters 
who stood across the street 
the supreme court has agreed to review a missouri case in which a 
lower federal court struck down a stringent state antiabortion law 
as unconstitutional in its appeal the state urged reversal of roe 
vs wade and the reagan administration filed a brief calling the 
missouri case an appropriate opportunity to reconsider the jan 
22 1973 decision 
attorney general dick thornburgh expressed hope on sunday that 
the high court with the addition of new reagan appointee anthony 
kennedy will use the missouri case to overturn roe vs wade

the yellow ribbon that adorned a white house 
door for more than three years in memory of american hostages is 
gone and president bushs spokesman said monday no one seems to 
know what happened to it 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the absence of the 
ribbon does not reflect any lack of concern by the new president for 
the fate of the hostages held in the middle east 
fitzwater said the ribbon was affixed to the entrance to the west 
wing of the white house by president reagans secretary kathleen 
osborne he said he did not know whether she or anyone else from 
reagans staff took it down 
but he said president bushs concern for the hostages is 
strong and is a problem that is continually in his thoughts and in 
his planning 
osborne works for reagan now that the former president has 
retired to california but she was not in monday said reagans 
spokesman mark weinberg weinberg said he did not know what had 
happened to the ribbon 
the ribbon was given to reagan by families of the hostages held 
by extremists in lebanon and osborne placed it on the door in 
october 1985

the eastern weather satellite providing the 
popular cloud pictures seen in newspapers and on television is being 
shifted westward after a satellite serving the western states died 
from old age 
the loss of goeswest on saturday leaves the nation with just one 
stationary weather satellite another one is not due to be launched 
for at least 18 months 
we are going to miss goeswest said thomas m pyke jr head 
of satellite services at the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration the full twogoes system is a vital part of our 
network for tracking hurricanes and other severe storms 
now he said meteoroligists will have only limited coverage of 
atlantic and pacific ocean areas where these severe storms 
originate 
in addition hawaii and alaska will have only partial coverage 
the failure of the satellites imaging system was not a surprise 
the instrument had exceeded its expected lifespan last may and 
engineers had been nursing it along 
within two hours of saturdays failure information was being 
received from polarorbiting satellites pyke said data will also 
be available from the european and japanese weather satellites 
while having two stationary goes geostationary operational 
environmental satellite craft in orbit gives a broader view of the 
nations weather operating with one has been done before 
for nearly three years beginning in 1984 the western satellite 
was shifted eastward after the old eastern satellite failed 
that problem was solved in march 1987 with the launch of the new 
goeseast satellite 
that satellite is being moved slowly from a position 22300 miles 
over the equator at 795 degrees west longitude to a position at 108 
degrees west longtude it should be at the new position by feb 21 
that move is approximately equivalent to changing from looking at 
the nation from a position south of florence sc to a new 
location south of durango colo 
moving goeseast westward will allow it to see all of the 
contiguous 48 states as well as westward to hawaii and east to the 
middle ot the atlantic lost will be images of the western pacific 
where storms could form to advance on hawaii and the eastern 
atlantic the summertime breeding ground for hurricanes 
in the spring goeseast will be moved somewhat to the east to 
extend its coverage into hurricane breeding areas of the atlantic 
ocean 
it is the regular images provided by the stationary goes 
satellites that are most useful for following cloud movement 
tracking storms and watching for hurricanes 
two polarorbiting noaa satellites remain in use but they 
photograph each area of the earth only twice daily in contrast to 
the continual monitoring available from the goes instruments 
the failures of two goes satellites have been blamed on light 
bulbs used to illuminate the mirrors that detect cloud cover the 
current goeseast has two lightemitting diodes in addition to two 
light bulbs 
the failed goeswest was launched in 1983 and was expected to 
last at best until may 1988 a successor planned for launch in 
1986 was destroyed at liftoff when its booster rocket failed 
although the instruments that provide the cloud photos have 
failed goeswest is still performing other functions it collects 
data readings radioed from buoys and landbased weather instruments 
and relays the information to the national weather service 
in addition it serves as a communications relay station and will 
relay data from goeseast from the polarorbiting noaa satellites 
and from the european and japanese satellites 
goeswest cost 16 million when it was built in 1983 the 
replacement is planned for 1990 launch is part of a fivesatellite 
package that series was originally budgeted at 410 million but it 
now appears that the costs will be substantially higher

pressure is increasing on the socialist government 
for an independent investigation of a blossoming insidertrading 
scandal that involves one of president francois mitterrands closest 
friends 
communist party leader andre lajoinie and a prominent 
conservative michel noir appealed sunday for a parliamentary 
investigation of suspicious trading in shares of the us firm 
triangle industries inc last fall just before it was acquired by 
pechiney sa a governmentowned aluminum manufacturer 
officials at the presidential elysee palace say they will leave 
the inquiry to the commission des operations de bourse watchdog 
agency of the french stock exchange 
can the elysee which has preferred so far to defer to the 
stock exchange investigation and the slow process of the justice 
system still shelter behind this line of defense the financial 
daily les echos asked in an editorial monday 
alain boublil top aide to finance minister pierre beregovoy 
resigned friday then filed libel suits against three publications 
for reporting suspicions that he leaked vital information about the 
triangle takeover 
a key figure is rogerpatrice pelat a 70yearold retired 
businessman who met mitterrand in a german prisonerofwar camp 
they worked together in the french resistance and pelat has been a 
frequent companion on the presidents afternoon strolls through 
paris 
pelat was among investors who made quick profits by buying 
triangle stock at about 10 a share and selling a few days later 
when pechiney made its takeover bid nov 21 of 56 a share 
on saturday the daily le monde said mitterrand was given a 
secret report saying pelat or his son may have bought 40000 shares 
through a swiss bank and a broker in luxembourg in addition to the 
10000 he was known to have purchased through a french bank 
mitterrands office issued a terse statement monday night saying 
he had not received a report on the subject it offered no 
explanation or elaboration beyond repeating that the inquiry was 
exclusively in the hands of the stock market commission and anyone 
found guilty should be punished 
palat said he would wait for the investigators report before 
commenting im a patient man and i dont want to interfere with 
the commission des operations de bourse he told reporters monday 
night outside his paris apartment 
french newspaper reports say the us securities and exchange 
commission told its french counterpart it was investigating 
purchases just before the takeover bid of about 220000 shares in 
triangle which usually changed hands at the rate of only a few 
thousand a day 
much of the stock was bought through swiss banks which refuse to 
identify their clients 
max theret a businessman with close ties to mitterrands 
socialists has acknowledged buying 32300 shares but claims he had 
no inside information theret told reporters he tipped pelat that 
triangle was a good buy 
many government officials besides boublil were privy to the 
pechineytriangle deal which needed finance ministry approval how 
the information was leaked to some buyers if in fact it was has 
not become clear 
the stock exchange investigating agency which says it expects to 
finish its probe by the end of january issued a statement denying 
it was the source of the report le monde mentioned 
if it finds enough evidence the commission can give the file to 
prosecutors for pursuit it has no power to do more 
successful prosecutions have been rare in french stock market 
cases and even rarer in political scandals which often fade away 
unresolved after capturing the headlines for weeks 
liberation a leftist newspaper generally sympathetic to the 
socialist government said monday the involvement of the us 
securities and exchange commission made it less likely the

on a 90 vote the senate governmental affairs committee 
recommended that the full chamber consent to darmans nomination to 
head the office of management and budget 
sen john glenn dohio the panels chairman said the senate

darman provided no new details of what bush will propose next 
month when he announces how he will revise the 115 trillion fiscal 
1990 budget that president reagan sent congress on jan 9 under 
law the spending plan must have a deficit of no more than 100 
billion which means at least 27 billion in savings must be found 
obviously were looking at all parts of the budget with the 
exception of social security darman told the lawmakers 
darman who was questioned for a total of more than nine hours 
monday and last thursday reiterated that new taxes would also not 
be part of the package 
we are firm and have to be on the nonewtaxes point he 
said the thenvice president campaigned on that issue

be taken lightly

would be included under that pledge on monday added two new ones to 
the list higher levies on alcohol and tobacco

a human rights group appealed 
monday to the government to respond to the worst unrest in 20 years 
by talking to the people and firing those who ordered brutal 
police action against demonstrators 
czechoslovak cardinal frantisek tomasek made a similar appeal in 
a letter warning the government of possible confrontation and 
denouncing police violence according to an emigre in vienna 
the demands by the human rights group charter 77 came in a 
document it says it is sending to the national government and 
parliament 
activist petr uhl presented the paper at a news conference and 
urged east and west bloc governments groups and individuals to 
protest the detentions of dissidents such as vaclav havel who he 
said is the only writer of significance in jail anywhere in 
europe 
havel and 15 other activists were detained jan 16 on pragues 
central wenceslas square after eight of them tried to lay flowers in 
memory of jan palach a student who burned himself alive 20 years 
ago to protest the 1968 sovietled invasion of prague 
five of them have been released but face hooliganism charges 
carrying up to two years jail uhl said 
havel likely will face the same charge he said the playwright 
spent four years in jail after a 1979 subversion trial that provoked 
outcry in the west 
the unrest began jan 15 when police used batons dogs tear gas 
and water cannon to break up 5000 people defying a ban on a palach 
rally 
crowds demanding more freedom gathered daily on wenceslas square 
wednesdays rally was allowed to proceed peacefully but riot 
police thursday beat several demonstrators to disperse the crowd 
by saturday the situation was outwardly calm stilled by police 
patrols threats of prosecution and hundreds of arrests 
but uhl said that same day 400 to 500 people were detained 
temporarily at vsetaty village 18 miles north of prague as they 
tried to attend a graveside vigil for palach 
in budapest hungarian police saturday prevented 50 members of an 
independent group called the federation of young democrats from 
laying a wreath outside the czechoslovak embassy to commemorate jan 
palach magyar nemzet daily reported monday it said the police 
cited existing international rulings 
tomaseks letter provided by an emigre in vienna said the 
trust of the faithful as well as of a majority of the population 
was badly shaken by the police action against peaceful 
demonstrations 
i fear that by suppressing dialogue between the citizens and 
the government a confrontation is being provoked to the detriment 
of all of us the prelate said in the letter which was dated jan 
20 and addressed to czechoslovak premier ladislav adamec 
charter 77s document urged the communist party t appoint leaders 
who are capable of opening a dialogue with the whole of society 
without dialogue the democratic solution of the most immediate 
and weighty social and economic problems is not possible the 
document said 
it also demanded that all officials responsible for the 
unjustified and brutal police action be recalled from their 
functions including interior minister frantisek kincl 
official media have accused charter 77 and other independent 
groups of provoking antisocialist actions 
newspapers and television have quoted or shown several citizens 
speaking out against the demonstrations and calling for order so 
economic reforms proposed by authorities can take effect 
on monday however rude pravo quoted nine people who went to 
vsetaty and struck a more moderate tone 
it quoted a 25yearold identified only as rudolf m as saying 
in our country there is censorship thats why im here to see 
what is happening 
his quote was accompanied by an editors note saying censorship 
was abolished in 1968

pierre cardin solved the problem of hemlines 
showing splits that soar beyond the thigh monday in a springsummer 
haute couture collection that is leggy relaxed and refined 
the mood remained strictly feminine in six showings dominated by 
tender whispy fabrics bias cuts bodyhugging sheaths oversized 
pants and plenty of pleats 
balmain excelled in suits and nina ricci turned out beautiful 
dresses for a quiet summer night 
christian dior went to the sari to achieve the draped look using 
pyramidshaped jackets for contrast in his less exotic fare 
but it was cardin who proved the most daring with his 
longshort style refusing to say no to the mini he made it 
even tinier then covered it up almost 
suit skirts and dresses were slit front and back to the top of 
the thigh revealing a mini or little shorts in a more elegant 
version minis were covered with long flowing wraps fastened at the 
bodice or printed accordianpleated skirts 
in another variation he covered some tight sheaths with 
cloaklike jackets showing one particularly sultry version in a 
black slipper satin 
cardin also refused to abandon the structured shoulder replacing 
pads in suit jackets with little front tucks sometimes bowed that 
provide presence for the upper torso without overwhelming but like 
others he did not ignore the bare shoulder showing strapless 
sheaths and jumpsuits 
bows were everywhere at cardin at the waist down sleeves and on 
shoulders and cropped up periodically in other collections one 
evening gown at balmain featured an oversized bow fastened on the 
diagonal across the front 
cardin also emphasized asymetrical cuts using them effectively 
on suit jackets sometimes ending in a fringe 
ecological colors muted pastels prevailed at cardin but navy 
was big with all the houses 
navy was a predominant color at dior who also featured lots of 
beige dressed up with bright turquoises and fuchsias colors 
sometimes went wild with hot pink and orange used in a dress and 
jacket 
an array of beige and pastel suits were accented with brightly 
colored little pocket books and belts other suits featured flower 
embroidery on the jacket back or front 
dior kept the hemline demurely above the knee for daytime 
but suits were also temptresses at dior shown with black lace 
bustiers translucent blouses or nothing at all 
a navy suit with touches of strass embroidery over a nearly 
transparent navy mousseline blouse was a lovely example of city chic 
dior waxed exotic with his sari wrap draping feathery fabrics 
like crepe georgette or shantung silk crepe in a diagonal movement 
from the waist to the opposite shoulder and indian style around 
the back to the hand 
the effect is both feminine and whimsical but western women will 
likely have to learn to how to handle a handful of scarf and use 
it to best effect 
danish designer erik mortensen produced a lively collection 
splashed with color for pierre balmain his tricolor suits with 
oversized buttons on short jackets were pure sophistication along 
with a white suit with oversized black buttons little dresses in 
bursts of color were fun 
he also showed some deep slits but was less daring than cardin 
mortensen moved easily into evening elegance without abandoning 
color wide silk crepe pants and tunic or dresses in silk crepe or 
satin gauze ran the color spectrum two black strapless lacey 
evening gowns were adorned with huge standout flowers in yellow at 
the bodice or red flowers down the train 
nina ricci not known as a trendsetter produced a large 
collection of simple but beautiful clothes for all times of day 
using lots of wide soft pants pleats swirling skirts and 
cinched waists designer gerard pipart achieved a classic somewhat 
nostalgic femininity 
filmy dresses in soft colors seemed to float down the runway 
suits sometimes with deep decolletes and pant suits cut on a bias 
guaranteed the feminine touch 
dress hems were mostly below the knee and pant legs ended above 
the ankle 
jeanlouis scherrer seemed to luxuriate in pants and pleats 
showing every kind of pants suit for day and evening often dressed 
up with lace or embroidery he produced stunning geometrical pleats 
in an ivory day dress the pleats running verticle at the bodice 
horizontal at the haunch and vertical again in the skirt 
pleats also were used effectively in a bodyhugging ivory sheath 
brocaded at the haunch

prime minister rajiv gandhis congress party 
lost a key state election to a regional party allied with his chief 
national rival according to final results announced monday 
gandhis party led however in two smaller states where partial 
returns had been tallied news reports said 
the voting in tamil nadu a southern state was viewed as a key 
test of the popularity of gandhi who must call national 
parliamentary elections by december gandhi was elected to a 
fiveyear term in december 1984 
in tamil nadu the dravida progressive front and its allies won 
170 seats in the 234member state assembly said chief electoral 
officer dk oza who announced results of saturdays balloting 
led by former state chief minister muthuvel karunanidhi the 
party is allied with a new national coalition called the national 
front headed by gandhis chief rival vp singh 
former movie actress jayalalitha jayarams faction won seats in 
33 constituencies gandhis party came in third with just 26 seats 
oza said 
his party had hoped to retake control in tamil nadu after the 
death of chief minister mg ramachandran a popular actor who 
turned to politics after his death his huge party splintered into 
two groups one led by his former leading lady ms jayaram and the 
other by his widow janaki ramachandran 
her faction gained only one assembly seat independents won two 
and voting was postponed in two districts after the death of 
candidates 
its a verdict against rajiv gandhi karunanidhi told 
hundreds of cheering supporters outside his home in central madras 
i hope this victory is repeated in the national elections 
an editorial in mondays editions of the madrasbased hindu 
newspaper said the voters have dealt a severe blow to the image 
and prospects of the party in power which went out of the way to 
make this appear a contest of vital political significance 
political commentator cho ramaswamy said the defeat in tamil nadu 
could hurt gandhi in national elections because singh will project 
the regional partys victory as his own many members of the 
congress party will be jittery he said 
however gk moopanar president of the congress party in tamil 
nadu disputed that congress was badly hurt and said national 
elections are still far off 
gandhi had campaigned for his partys candidates throughout tamil 
nadu and there was speculation he might call early national 
elections if successful there 
vote tallying began monday for ballots cast saturday in assembly 
elections in the northeastern states of nagaland and mizoram where 
ballot boxes from remote interior villages had to be collected by 
helicopter 
partial returns showed gandhis party leading in both states 
which have a history of insurgency and unrest news reports said 
the voting in all three states which were placed under federal rule 
after political crises last year will restore local control 
gandhis party was slightly ahead in nagaland with 23 seats in 
the 60member assembly its only challenger the nagaland peoples 
council gained 18 according to news reports on governmentowned 
television doordarshan 
in mizoram gandhis party led in a threeway race for the 
40seat assembly congress captured 14 seats compared with eight 
for the mizo national front and 1 for the peoples conference

the agriculture department reaffirming what 
many shoppers figured out long ago said monday that making a salad 
from a supermarket salad bar is more expensive than buying the 
ingredients whole and making the salad from scratch 
nutritionist eileen p newman said a survey of 55 items showed 
for example that many common salad ingredients including 
cucumbers iceberg lettuce tomatoes spinach and green peppers 
cost from two to four times more at salad bars 
the departments advise based on its survey of washingtonarea 
supermarkets last july consumers may want to weigh the cost of 
salad bar purchases against preparing the items at home

and life 
nobody in his right mind would say this isnt a human being a 
person said mrs bender 
among the thousands who assembled monday to march on the 16th 
anniversary of the supreme courts roe vs wade abortion decision 
there were a multitude of reasons for being here but a singular 
intensity 
construction worker tom noel 28 marched in his spare hours he 
counsels pregnant women some little more than children some older 
than he is in a pregnancy aid center he doesnt believe in 
showing them awful pictures of bloody fetuses 
he said he never knows if he has been persuasive and prevented an 
abortion very few come back to tell you he said but i know 
ive changed some minds i know ive saved a few 
noels siblings five brothers two sisters agree on the 
abortion issue except my liberal brother in california

foot warehouse once the conversation got around to abortion and a 
young forklift operator offered some views about a womans right to 
have control over her own body 
at the time kodak workers were afraid of layoffs so smith put 
the issue this way if 4000 births a day are prevented from 
occurring he said there would be that many fewer baby snapshots

a predawn earthquake in soviet central asia 
unleashed a 50foothigh wall of dirt and mud that buried a mountain 
village and swept through at least two others monday killing up to 
1000 people as they slept officials said 
the devastating earthquake in the republic of tadzhikistan was 
the second to strike the soviet union in two months 
almost everybody died zainiddin nasreddinov editorinchief 
of tadzhikistans official news agency said by telephone after 
visiting the wrecked farming settlement of sharora he estimated the 
number of dead there alone at 600 
sharora had more than 150 peasant households before that tragic 
moment the soviet news agency tass reported now most of it is 
razed to the ground by the ruthless force of the natural calamity 
tass said the number of dead in the disaster zone 1800 miles 
southeast of moscow was estimated at 1000 but cautioned that was a 
preliminary figure 
rescue work is being continued and distant mountain villages 
have not been checked yet tass said damaged roads were hampering 
those efforts 
the quake struck the southwestern part of tadzhikistan a soviet 
republic of more than 48 million people that borders afghanistan 
and china 
the 40second tremor at 502 am 602 pm est sunday was 
centered about 20 to 30 miles southwest of tadzhikistans capital of 
dushanbe a city of more than 460000 people in the fertile gissar 
district a center of grapegrowing and livestockraising tass said 
an official at dushanbes seismic center said the quake was 
strong enough to knock things off shelves in tall apartment 
buildings in the city but that it caused no known damage or 
injuries there he declined to give his name 
the us geological survey in reston va estimated the quake at 
54 on the richter scale which measures ground motion as recorded 
on a seismograph the dec 7 earthquake in northwestern armenia 
1300 miles west of dushanbe registered a 69 on the richter scale 
and killed 25000 people 
the earthquake unhinged a wall of sodden dirt and mud at least 
five miles wide that buried the village of okulibolo and much of 
sharora said erkin kasimov an official of tadzhikistans foreign 
ministry 
almost all of the victims died asleep in their beds police 
maj alexander loparev duty officer at tadzhikistan interior 
ministry headquarters in dushanbe said by telephone 
residents of another village okulipoyen apparently roused in 
time fled in panic before the mudslide which traveled 1 to 1 
miles could reach their homes kasimov said from dushanbe 
officials and soviet media said the devastation was vast and 
total in places 
in okulibolo and okulipoyen near the epicenter everything 
is destroyed all the homes the schools the hospitals and 
clinics the stores nasreddinov said 
okulibolo is a heap of rubble and the chairman of a local 
economic cooperative hairrulo yuldashev said the households of 70 
peasant families were completely demolished and buried by the 
landslide tass said more than 70 villagers were buried by the 
landslide it said 
in sharora cries and wails can be heard everwhere tass 
reported some are bemoaning and burying their near and dear ones 
while others are trying to find the few survivors between the thick 
layer of sand and clay 
it said all of the villages streets had been buried under the 
50foothigh layer of earth that the earthquake detached from a hill 
near the village 
the tv news program vremya showed aerial footage of sharora 
with white roofs of buried homes peeking through the dirt like 
seashells scattered on a beach 
kasimov said that according to preliminary figures the quake and 
landslide destroyed about 100 buildings including five schools and 
a maternity hospital near the epicenter 
the hospital was evacuated of mothers and newborns before the 
wall of mud arrived and there were no victims he said 
there was no exact count available for the population of the 
stricken villages but the official at the dushanbe seismic center 
said families are traditionally large in the mostly moslem republic 
and that one dwelling often houses eight to 10 people 
the quake and landslide downed three miles of power lines 
destroyed nine miles of telephone lines and inundated four miles of 
a navigation canal with mud kasimov said 
thousands of head of publicly owned cattle have perished 
tass said it said thousands of acres of fertile farmland were 
covered by a thick layer of sand and clay 
nasreddinov said the buildings destroyed were onestory brick 
structures soldiers went to the villages to keep order and restore 
communications electricity and water he said 
kasimov said geologists believed water from mountain springs had 
accumulated under the soil of the hills in the gissar region making 
them prone to mudslides 
when the earthquake came it was like a catapult and it hurled 
the sodden earth onto the villages below kasimov said 
tass said bulldozers cranes and excavators had been rushed to 
the quake zone to help dig for survivors and that volunteers had 
come from dushanbe and other nearby areas to help in rescue and 
relief 
equipment food and fuel were also sent to the scene tass said 
on vremya a statement of condolences from the kremlin 
leadership was read and aid promised from the national government 
according to nasreddinov president mikhail s gorbachev telephoned 
tadzhikistan officials to promise moscows help 
in washington us state department spokesman charles redman 
said he knew of no request for assistance from the soviets our 
sympathy certainly goes out again to the victims of this most recent 
earthquake he said 
the experience of the armenian earthquake shows the death toll in 
tadzhikistan could be much higher than the first estimates soviet 
officials including foreign minister eduard a shevardnaze 
initially spoke of thousands of victims in the armenian quake 
kremlin spokesmen later estimated 55000 people had been killed but 
on dec 29 armenian officials gave what they called an accurate 
death toll of 25000

the deputy prime minister explained the 
communist partys aboutface on legalizing solidarity by saying only 
compromise can rouse the people and economy from apathy 
economic reform needs political backing not only from the 
government but also from the constructive opposition it needs 
social support ireneusz sekula said in an interview monday with 
the official news agency pap 
his comments come the day after solidarity accepted a communist 
party offer to negeotiate legalizing the banned trade union 
federation 
there is no choice either we decide on actions forming a 
feasible chance of success or we reject them selecting defeat right 
from the start pap quoted sekula as saying 
he said the government needs support from the opposition and 
people at large to help pull the economy and people out from 
apathy helplessness and stillness 
solidaritys national executive commission on sunday agreed to 
negotiate and said talks to reverse polands economic and social 
troubles should begin as soon as possible 
one of the most difficult things will be the matter of economic 
action reforming the economy this is an essential matter 
said mieczyslw gil one of three solidarity leaders preparing the 
unions negotiating position 
groups of solidarity activists and factory commissions would hold 
discussions on economic reform gil said 
the official media which once denounced or ignored solidaritys 
activities has published straightforward accounts of its position 
since the party offer was made wednesday 
front pages of mondays newspapers were filled with discussion of 
the offer and solidaritys agreement 
trybuna ludu the communist party newspaper carried the full 
text of the independent unions statement and its own report with 
extensive quotes from solidarity leader lech walesa 
but voices of dissent can be heard complaining of the partys new 
stance 
lets speak the truth achievements are meager and there are a 
lot of problems and worries said alfred miodowicz head of the 
only official trade union alliance in an interview with the 
government newspaper rzeczpospolita 
in washington president bushs chief spokesman said the white 
house welcomes the announcement of negotiations 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said the us government long 
has felt that progress toward reform can only take place through a 
policy of dialogue and national reconciliation 
it also would have a positive effect on uspolish relations 
fitzwater said he noted that bush visited poland and several other 
european countries in 1987 and watches developments there with 
interest 
polands government first proposed talks with the opposition last 
august during serious labor turmoil started by workers angry about 
the failure of wages to keep pace with inflation 
walesa said he would not enter discussions unless the party made 
a political decision to legalize the union 
poland faces a mounting foreign debt and people are tired of 
continual price increases and chronic shortages 
in the pap interview sekula said the complexity of the situation 
means the governments economic strategy no longer can be directed 
simply at fighting inflation 
he suggested increasing production of consumer goods and curbing 
consumption to achieve market balance 
polish prime minister mieczyslaw rakowski ended a visit to west 
germany monday with an appeal to bonn for concrete support and 
understanding above all in decreasing polands foreign debt of 
39 billion zdf television reported 
friedhelm ost west german chancellor helmut kohls chief 
spokesman said preparations are being made for kohl to visit poland 
later this year he said the trip could be soon but gave no date

proplo underground leaders monday rejected 
defense minister yitzhak rabins offer of elections in the occupied 
lands and called for escalating the palestinian uprising to counter 
tougher army policies 
in the city of nablus in the occupied west bank assailants 
hurled firebombs into an israeli bank injuring several arab 
employees and causing minor property damage the army said arab 
reports said four employees were treated for burns or smoke 
inhalation 
a 33yearold man was shot with a plastic bullet in the west bank 
village of jaba and four palestinians were wounded in the occupied 
gaza strip when army troops opened fire to halt stone throwing arab 
hospital officials said 
the army said it was checking the reports 
in an underground leaflet circulated in the occupied territories 
the unified national leadership of the uprising rejected rabins 
proposal to hold elections in return for an end to violence rabin 
no 2 in the leftleaning labor party also proposed extended 
autonomy as an interim solution 
the leaflet said the proposal will be sent to the garbage dump 
of history 
prime minister yitzhak shamir head of the rightwing likud bloc 
also criticized rabins plan 
i hear that all the arabs reject this plan shamir told 
israel radio i would not propose that we enter into a whirlpool 
of arguments about a thing that stands no change of coming into 
being 
shamirs closest ally foreign minister moshe arens said 
israels peace plan still was being formulated 
arens speaking to leaders of hadassah an american jewish 
womens organization rejected talks with the plo and israeli 
participation in a proposed international peace conference 
a dozen israeli peace activists meanwhwile met with 
palestinians in the arab village of jabel mukaber on the edge of 
jerusalem and told residents they backed israeli talks with the plo 
the meeting was part of a mounting campaign to pressure israel to 
change its policy toward the plo which recently renounced terrorism 
and recognized the jewish state 
even my friends in the likud are getting around to the idea 
of talking to the plo said peace activist moshe amirav who was 
kicked out of the likud bloc for meeting with palestinian leaders 
they are realizing we have no choice but to talk 
uprising leaders said in their leaflet that an israeli agreement 
to an international conference with plo participation was required 
for an end to antiisraeli violence 
the leaflet the 33rd distributed since the uprising began 13 
months ago said palestinians will step up their fight against the 
occupation despite tougher army policies for dealing with the 
rebellion 
addressed to our heroic people it said we know such 
measures will never stop you from escalating the uprising it 
doesnt matter how long it takes and how many martyrs have to be 
sacrificed 
last week the army announced that it will destroy the homes of 
stonethrowers and fire plastic bullets at fleeing assailants and 
protesters who build stone barricades 
plastictipped bullets were introduced in august as a less lethal 
alternative to lead rounds but at least 40 deaths have been 
attributed to the plastic ammunition according to israeli 
newspapers 
since the uprising began in december 1987 367 palestinians and 
15 israelis have been killed 
in response to widespread criticism of the army policies 
attorney general yosef harish has agreed to review the openfire 
orders with top legal advisers this week 
army chief of staff lt gen dan shomron said the policies will 
help retore calm in the occupied lands 
maybe at the first stage it will lead to tension but if we see 
it in longer perspective i assume it will eventually bring a 
relaxation he said on israel radio

surrealist painter salvador dali whose 
fantastic and memorable dreamscapes were as eccentric and flamboyant 
as his behavior died today in his hometown his doctor said he was 
84 
dali died at 1015 am at figueras hospital said dr charles 
ponsati the cause of death was cardiac arrest brought on by his 
respiratory insufficiency and pneumonia he told reporters 
the painter had been in poor health and confined to a wheelchair 
since suffering severe burns in an electrical fire in his home in 
august 1984 
he was rushed to the hospital five days ago suffering from a bad 
heart dali had been hospitalized three times since late november 
a founder of the surrealist movement dali born on may 11 1904 
in this small catalonian town he was the last of an outstanding 
generation of spanish painters that included pablo picasso and joan 
miro 
his persistence of memory with its melting watches and 
barren landscape is perhaps the worlds most celebrated surrealist 
painting a vivid image that became an indelible part of 20th 
century culture 
miguel domenech dalis attorney said dali died softly 
without making any special last statement 
condolences came quickly from king juan carlos a personal friend 
of dali and from prime minister felipe gonzalez spanish culture 
minister jorge semprun called dali the last of a generation of 
creators who revolutionized art in our century 
the divine dali as he liked to call himself was instantly 
recognizable his pointed waxed mustache curling up like a bulls 
horns his long hair falling over his neck and one of his more than 
30 walking sticks draped over an arm 
what dali called his sublime craziness began early he was 
expelled from art school in 1926 for arrogance and briefly jailed 
for catalonian separatist political activities he said later the 
only difference between a crazy person and me is the fact that i am 
not crazy 
few critics faulted dalis technical virtuosity although his 
work was not held in the highest esteem but he was overwhelmingly 
popular in 1979 and 1980 a major retrospective drew more than a 
million visitors in paris and 250000 in london 
to most critics dali was a flawed talent sometimes managing to 
balance realistic technique and irrational content but all too 
often caught up in his own role as a poseurpainter he completed 
most of his critically successful works before he was 35 
in addition to being a painter dali was a decorator a fashion 
and jewelry designer and an author of poetry prose and essays 
after being kicked out of the school of fine arts in madrid dali 
went to paris and quickly became involved in the surrealist movement 
the surrealists strove to locate the real world in the realm 
of the unconscious and dreams removing it from its shell of 
supposed reality 
dali made his mark as coproducer with fellow spaniard luis 
bunuel of the 1929 short film an andalusian dog whose style and 
visual violence set a new standard in avantgarde cinema 
but dalis exhibitionism and egocentrism provoked the wrath of 
his fellows when he claimed surrealism is me at the end of the 
193639 spanish civil war he was drummed out of the movement as a 
phony and an archfranquist dilettante dali made no secret 
of his support for the 36year regime of francisco franco 
with a loan from picasso dali made his first trip to the united 
states in 1934 with gala the russianborn woman who became his 
faithful companion muse and the touchstone of his personality and 
life 
gala dimitrovna diaharoff met dali in 1929 when she and her 
husband french surrealist poet paul eluard visited the painter at 
his seaside home on spains northeastern costa brava 
at dalis request she never left they married in 1958 six 
years after eluards death they had no children dali said 
geniuses always produced mediocre children 
dali said gala was the woman who always inspired me without 
her everything would be over 
gala died june 10 1982 after her death the painter said he 
chose to remain inside the castle 
two years later a mysterious electrical fire broke out while 
dali slept sending the painter to the hospital and bringing to 
public attention what many termed his near imprisonment by three 
close associates it was never clear why the fire burned several 
hours without being noticed when dali was supposed to have 24hour 
care 
a reynolds morse founder of the salvador dali museum in st 
petersburg fla and a longtime acquaintance of the painter said 
at the time the three had refused him entrance to the castle 
after the fire dali moved into the galatea tower attached to his 
theatermuseum in figueras and remained there confined to a 
wheelchair and fed through a tube he received a pacemaker in 1986 
the highest price ever paid for a dali was the 23 million a 
japanese buyer paid in 1987 for a 197476 oil on canvas gala 
looking at the mediterranean sea which from a distance of 20 meters 
is transformed into a portrait of abraham lincoln homage to 
rothko 
the price pales beside the 3846 million paid for a picasso last 
november but dali himself admitted that from 1964 on he began 
signing blank sheets of paper resulting in a proliferation of dali 
fakes 
dalis estate has been estimated at nearly 90 million 
xavier cugat a band leader friend of dali and fellow catalan 
told spanish national radio that dalis death could prompt a whole 
new round of fakes because now his works are going to start 
showing up like mushrooms and because no one can verify their 
authenticity this is going to be awful he said 
the painters body was taken back to his galatea tower residence 
maria teresa dalis housekeeper said the residence was besieged by 
thousands of people who wanted to pay last respects 
the painter was to lie in state in the tower until his funeral 
scheduled wednesday afternoon 
the theatermuseum where the artist will be buried was closed 
sunday so workers could build the tomb his tomb will be in the 
inner court of the museum just beneath a great glass dome crowning 
the building 
dalis father wanted him to follow in his footsteps as a notary 
public in figueras but dali once said he had one main goal in life 
to be dali 
life would be practically impossible on the globe if there 
existed 20 or 30 dalis he said but there is nothing to fear 
that can never happen

amnesty international plans no major 
protests against the scheduled execution of convicted killer ted 
bundy as it has for previous electrocutions but a local group said 
monday it will hold a vigil 
bundy is scheduled to be executed tuesday for the rape and murder 
of a 12yearold girl he has been convicted of two other florida 
murders as well 
one of the nations most notorious criminals bundy has been 
suspected in the disappearances or murders of 36 young women across 
the country mostly in the northwest in recent days he has 
confessed to killing 20 young women in washington utah idaho and 
colorado authorities said 
members of the gainesville coalition against the death penalty 
planned to hold a vigil outside the institution tuesday said 
elizabeth dawson with the florida clearinghouse on criminal justice 
a few coalition members normally turn out to protest executions 
about 100 phone calls and several dozen letters and telegrams 
have been received at gov bob martinezs office recently with most 
supporting the governors push to execute bundy 
calls and letters are very very favorable toward executing 
this man as quickly as possible said brian ballard the 
governors director of operations ive heard tell of a few 
against capital punishment but we have not gotten one saying ted 
bundy is innocent 
most of the missives opposing bundys execution are from 
supporters of amnesty international a worldwide humanrights 
organization that opposes the death penalty in all cases and 
sometimes mounts highvisibility public opinion drives against 
executions 
many of the letters protesting the execution are from 
outofstate or overseas and say capital punishment is wrong said 
ballard they carry little weight with martinez because the governor 
answers to florida voters who support the death penalty he said 
although amnesty international has mobilized its forces in the 
past on behalf of florida death row inmates such as willie jasper 
darden who was executed last march despite a worldwide plea for 
clemency the group has mounted only a minimal effort for bundy 
no we dont have anything planned in the way of a protest 
said jacqui hunt an amnesty spokeswoman in new york we are doing 
with ted as we do with all people scheduled to be executed 
people write letters and telegrams 
she said public opinion favoring bundys death was not silencing 
the organization but that limited funds and staff force the group to 
be selective about its battles and to focus on legislative changes 
we believe the death penalty is wrong in all cases she said 
there arent many cases that we work on an individual basis 
because we dont have the resources and we feel that our time is 
better spent in trying to change legislation

last years drought is still having some 
lingering effect on the nations dairy farmers but an agriculture 
department report said monday that 1989 milk output still could set 
another record 
droughtcaused increases in feed costs probably will have some 
effect on milk output in the first half but 1989 milk production is 
likely to total about the same or slightly higher than the year 
before the departments economic research service said 
milk production rose to a record level of 1453 billion pounds in 
1988 due entirely to a boost of almost 3 percent in milk output per 
cow the number of cows declined by 1 percent to a record low 
average of 102 million head during the year 
any milk production rises should be easily absorbed by a 1 
percent to 3 percent rise in commercial use the report said 
government purchases probably will decline to 5 billion to 7 
billion pounds milk equivalent from 88 billion in 1988 
the department buys surplus cheese butter and nonfat dry milk 
to support the price of milk paid to farmers by dealers 
a late1988 surge in domestic commercial use of milk and dairy 
products is combining with a vigorous export demand for nonfat dry 
milk to create strong dairy markets in early 1989 the report said 
retail dairy prices rose in december and are higher than they 
have been in recent years at this time the report said over all of 
1989 retail prices of dairy products are expected to gain an 
average of 2 percent to 4 percent compared with last years 2 
percent

european foreign ministers on monday 
approved a plan to impose heavy sanctions on some us imports if 
the bush administration fails to move quickly to end a stubborn 
trade dispute over hormonetreated meat from america 
ministers of the 12nation european economic community agreed to 
slap duties on imports of us walnuts and dried fruit but 
indefinitely delayed implementing the tariffs to allow more time to 
settle the conflict 
we hope the new north american administration will adopt a more 
intelligent attitude said spanish foreign minister francisco 
fernandez ordonez 
he said the newly inaugurated us president george bush is a 
free trader i hope he will honor that name 
us officials expressed satisfaction that the community delayed 
imposing the duties 
we want to make every effort to first contain and then resolve 
this dispute and this decisionis clearly a positive step in that 
direction read a statement from the us mission to the trading 
bloc 
but the statement also said officials were very concerned 
about the ministers decision to approve a list of products which 
could eventually be the target ofcounterretaliation 
the common market on jan 1 banned imports of us meat from 
cattle treated with growth hormones an action affecting about 100 
million worth of beef and beef byproducts european officials 
contend the hormones pose a health risk a claim the united states 
disputes american farmers use the hormones to fatten cattle 
the united states immediately retaliated by setting about 100 
million worth of higher tariffs on a variety of products from the 
common market including boneless beef and pork hams 
the foreign ministers approved their own retaliatory measures 
which would lift duties to 100 percent on us imports of unshelled 
walnuts and dried fruit including apricots peaches prunes 
apples papayas and pears 
the european commission the trading groups executive body had 
asked the ministers to put the countermeasures into effect on feb 
1 
but fernandez ordonez said the ministers refused to set a date 
because they did not want to diminish room for maneuvering we have 
with the new administration 
still he said the ministers decided we shall not sit back and 
do nothing after the united states slapped higher duties on some 
european goods

jack lang french culture minister said dali created pictoral 
work of great philosophical significance while at the same time 
making himself known to a vast public 
kirk varnedoe director of painting and sculpture at the museum 
of modern art in new york said dali created some of the most 
unforgettable imagery associated with the surrealist movement but 
may be even more enduringly remembered as a showman

modern art of the scandalous and the playful or of psychological 
revelation and gadfly irritation dali will always be an exemplary

trafficking the state department said monday 
the addition of four state department uh1h helicopters will bring 
the total involved in the antidrug campaign to nine department

cocaine growing area 
redman had no figures but the washington post reported in 
mondays editions that 25 to 30 dea agents will be sent to the area

a federal judge dismissed an 880000 
civil lawsuit stemming from a hazing at the citadel after attorneys 
for the black plaintiff and five white defendants reached a 
settlement 
as part of the agreement the terms of the settlement will not be 
released attorneys david norton and bachman smith who represent 
the defendants said monday 
the lawsuit over an october 1986 incident at the military 
college had been expected to go to trial early this year 
five white cadets disguised under sheets and towels entered black 
cadet kevin nesmiths barracks room in the middle of the night 
the five muttered obscenities and left a charred paper cross 
behind the five who have since graduated were ordered to walk 195 
hourlong punishment tours with rifles the harshest penalty in 
school history short of dismissal 
nesmith who left the college shortly after the incident later 
sued charging his constitutional rights including the right to be 
free from racial discrimination had been violated 
school officials were dismissed as defendants last month after 
us district judge sol blatt jr ruled they enjoyed qualified 
immunity 
now that their cases have been settled i hope the young men 
involved can move on with their lives i wish them all the best 
college president maj gen james grimsley said monday 
while blatts order issued friday leaves open the possibility 
that nesmith could reopen the case a final order is expected in 
about two weeks after attorneys sign the agreement norton said 
blatts order states the suit is dismissed without prejudice to 
the right upon good cause shown within 60 days to reopen the 
action if settlement is not consummated 
but norton said the order is a procedural matter to clear the 
docket of the case and that the final order will dismiss the case 
with prejudice meaning nesmith could not bring it again 
the five white former cadets named in the lawsuit were steven a 
webb jeffery d plumley paul l koss jimmy m biggerstaff and 
maurice f bostic jr all five graduated from the college last 
spring

former rep michael barnes of maryland dropped 
out of the race for chairman of the democratic party on monday and 
endorsed ronald brown a former party official who played a key role 
in the final stages of jesse jacksons presidential campaign 
it is apparent that my candidacy is unlikely to be 
successful barnes said in a letter announcing his decision 
barnes departure from the race left four candidates vying to 
succeed paul g kirk jr as party chairman brown michigan party 
chairman richard wiener and former reps jim jones of oklahoma and 
james stanton of ohio 
i believe that party unity will be best served if we can unite 
behind ron a man of proven ability who has served in numerous 
important capacities in our party including deputy chair said 
barnes 
im extremely pleased that mike barnes today endorsed my 
candidacy brown said in a statement issued by his campaign staff 
mike barnes is a great asset to our party he has a record of 
leadership a command of issues and a commitment to service i am 
proud of his support 
a washington attorney with close ties to sen edward m kennedy 
of massachusetts brown agreed to serve as jacksons convention 
manager last spring a move that was hailed by many party leaders 
who hoped the jackson campaign would be less confrontational under 
his influence 
that proved to be true and brown received a share of the credit 
for the show of unity between jackson and presidential nominee 
michael dukakis that marked the closing session of the atlanta 
convention 
but when brown announced his plan to run for the party 
chairmanship his link to jackson was seen as a handicap to his 
chances 
with the endorsement of such party leaders as kennedy new york 
gov mario cuomo california sen alan cranston and pennsylvania 
gov bob casey brown has moved into the role of frontrunner in the 
race 
however the other contenders insisted they would not follow 
barnes lead 
he wants to stay in said cindy cipriani an aide to stanton 
our tracking shows the race is still open 
brian lunde wieners campaign manager questioned whether barnes 
has enough support to make a difference in the race 
he didnt really have any votes to spread around he said 
the democratic national committee will elect the new party 
chairman on feb 10

sudden acceleration in cadillac cars made from 
1982 through 1988 has resulted in five deaths a consumer affairs 
group said in a petition filed with the government monday 
the center for auto safety a washingtonbased group petitioned 
the national highway traffic safety administration to order a recall 
of 11 million cadillacs having ht4100 41liter v8 engines 
altogether the center said it knows of 120 instances of sudden 
acceleration in the cadillacs resulting in 63 accidents and 70 
injuries 
victims in many of these cases are pedestrians or bystanders 
unable to dodge an outofcontrol cadillac the center said in its 
petition clearly runaway cadillacs represent an obvious threat 
to the health and safety of not only their occupants but also others 
outside the vehicles 
the government agency said it would respond to the centers 
request within 120 days a spokesman declined to comment further on 
the centers petition 
a spokesman for general motors cadillac division in detroit 
vince muniga said the agency in a broad investigation of gm cars in 
1986 was unable to pinpoint a common design flaw or manufacturing 
defect that could be the root cause for these unwanted acceleration 
incidents 
gm also has investigated these claims and reached the same 
conclusion muniga said we are cooperating fully with nhtsas 
current inquiries and if the center has any technical information 
that would shed light on these incidents we would certainly like to 
see it 
the government agency in response to an earlier petition by the 
center has been investigating since april allegations of sudden 
acceleration in frontwheeldrive cadillac devilles and fleetwoods 
made from 1985 through 1988 
the models included in the centers latest petition are the 
19821984 devilles and fleetwoods 19821987 eldorados sevilles 
broughams and fleetwood broughams and 19871988 allantes 
one of the cars cited in the petition a 1985 eldorado crashed 
through the front of a kmart department store in belleville nj 
last november killing two shoppers and injuring 13 the center said 
in recent years federal engineers have investigated allegations 
of sudden acceleration in about 80 million vehicles made by 10 
manufacturers according to figures compiled by the center 
about 440000 cars were recalled as a result of the 
investigations the center said

a group of immigrants including three 
americans appealed to israels supreme court on monday over the 
governments refusal to register them as jews because they were 
converted by nonorthodox rabbis 
the appeal has again raised the controversial who is a jew 
question which was a hot election issue last fall and deeply 
angered american and canadian jewry 
the 10 immigrants are asking to be registered as jews so they may 
obtain automatic citizenship or marry there are no civil marriages 
in israel and orthodox rabbis will not marry mixed couples 
the court case was brought after the interior ministry refused to 
register the immigrants and instead referred their cases to 
rabbinical courts said yehoshua schoffman an attorney for three of 
the immigrants 
the ministry headed by an ultraorthodox minister took the 
action because the immigrants had been converted by conservative 
rabbis schoffman said 
the immigrants argue that this is against israels 1950 law of 
return the law broadly defines a jew as anyone born of a jewish 
mother or who has converted and professes no other faith 
but orthodox rabbis who have a monopoly over jewish religious 
life in israel have frequently sought to end automatic immigration 
rights for jews converted by rabbis of other streams of judaism 
a controversy erupted over the issue last november when four 
religious parties tried to get the government to agree to outlaw 
nonorthodox conversions in exchange for their participation in a 
coalition cabinet 
the demand raised the ire of american and canadian jews many of 
whom are of the conservative and reform branches of judaism 
the political effort was abandoned when prime minister yitzhak 
shamir bypassed the religious parties and instead formed a 
government with the mainstream labor party 
now they are trying to argue that the law doesnt even have to 
be changed schoffman said in a telephone interview 
schoffman said one of his clients matthew polomsky 34 from new 
haven conn was denied registration as a jew in 1987 
polomsky was referred to a rabbinical court which ordered him to 
study orthodox law before it would consider giving him a conversion 
certificate schoffman said 
this is illegal schoffman argued 
in other cases immigrants were not registered as jews for 
similar reasons schoffman said 
interior ministry spokeswoman tovah elinson said it was a 
longstanding practice to refer immigrants to rabbinical courts if 
there is a doubt about whether they are jewish 
we do not decide who is a jew we only register elinson 
said she said she could not discuss specific cases while they were 
under court appeal 
the cases were being heard by a fivejudge panel headed by 
supreme court chief justice meir shamgar 
the supreme court is the highest court in the land and issues 
involving interpretation of the law can be appealed directly to the 
supreme court as was done in this case 
the supreme court last dealt with the issue in a december 1986 
ruling that forced the interior ministry to register shoshana miller 
of colorado springs colo as a jew ms miller was converted by a 
reformed rabbi

scientists are warning that another earthquake 
could hit armenia with the same force as the tremor that caused a 
deadly mudslide in tadzhikistan on monday the tass news agency 
reported 
the monday quake and resulting landslide in the soviet central 
asian republic 1300 miles east of armenia killed 1000 people 
according to preliminary official estimates 
the dec 7 quake in northwestern armenia killed 25000 people 
tass said underground shocks have been decreasing in the armenian 
regions of aparan and razdan and that exploratory wells indicate a 
change in ground water level 
researchers believe these phenomena portend a dangerous release 
of energy accumulated in the earths crust it said monday 
it said scientists have warned as a result that an earthquake 
rated 7 on the 12point soviet scale could occur that was the 
force of the quake that caused the tadzhikistan mudslide which 
wiped out one village and swept through at least two others 
the dec 7 earthquake which toppled multistory buildings was 
rated in some places as 10 or higher on the soviet scale 
tass said the december quake also shook aparan 19 miles 
southeast of the epicenter and razdan 37 miles to the southeast 
tass said residents of the two regions have been warned about 
possible shocks but did not say when the scientists believe 
another earthquake mayh occur 
the soviet scale measures the degree to which a quake is felt in 
a given area on the richter scale which measures the energy

from chain saws to movies 
the american public is coming to the rescue of yellowstone national 
park to help it spruce up after fires roared across nearly 1 million 
acres last year 
yogi the bear might also join the national park services 
effort although that plan has not been finalized 
school children individuals and major corporations are pitching 
in to see yellowstone recover from the fire storms that involved 
995000 acres of the 22 millionacre park 
as of monday the park had received 24036 in cash contributions 
from 408 individuals groups and schools for fire recovery work 
another 20000 was pledged by conoco oil co for a 30minute film 
titled yellowstone recovery and 50 chain saws valued at roughly 
20000 have been promised by poulan weed eater of shreveport la 
obviously all the forest fires last year throughout the 
country drew a great deal of interest from the corporate 
officials said charles hodges who works for the poulans 
advertising firm in dallas they were looking for ways to help the 
forest service or park service 
those donating may never have been to yellowstone but they have 
been spurred by a sense that yellowstone is their park said 
duncan morrow the park services chief spokesman in washington dc 
i think theres little question of that that yellowstone as 
the oldest national park and one of the three or four best 
known national parks in this country and possibly even the world 
brings out of people a sense that this is something that theyve got 
a stake in he said monday in a telephone interview 
some donations have had to be turned down by the park service 
such as offers of seedlings that are not native to yellowstone he 
said 
other donations are more unusual such as the 414141 received 
from the uss yellowstone which raised the money from sailors who 
watched movies for 41 hours and 41 minutes 
kindergarten students have donated money raised through bake 
sales nursery school students have sold apples to raise funds for 
the park pine cones and acorns also have been sent to yellowstone 
from grade school students throughout the country 
there also have been preliminary talks with hannabarbera the 
producer of the yogi the bear cartoon on how it might be able 
to help the effort 
the childrens donations are being set aside specifically to fund 
the childrens fire trail which will travel through burned and 
unburned sections of yellowstone along the path will be signs to 
educate children on the effects of fire 
the trail expected to cost 126000 will be dedicated to those 
children who donate to it so far 706 in donations have been 
earmarked for the project 
conocos donation went to fund a film of the yellowstone fires 
compiled by dick davis who runs sportsman productions inc in 
pineville la 
davis interest in the fires led him to yellowstone where he 
talked to park officials about doing a television show which would 
allow the park service to tell its side of the yellowstone fires 
conoco thought it was a good idea and they provided the 
funding he said 
the film will be distributed to 150 public television stations 
and cable networks that reach an estimated 44 million households 
another 500 copies of the film will be made for distribution to 
schools and clubs 
yellowstone officials also are seeking funds to fix up trails 
bridges and campsites damaged during firefighting efforts for 
erosion control projects to buy equipment for public education 
efforts to help visitors understand the fires and fire ecology and 
for research on a variety of subjects relating to the fires

east germany said monday it will cut its armed 
forces by 10000 soldiers and trim defense spending 10 percent 
in west germany meanwhile a soviet official reiterated moscows 
call for elimination of shortrange nuclear weapons from europe 
east german leader erich honecker said that as part of the 
cutback six tank regiments and an air force squadron would be 
mustered out resulting in a reduction of 600 tanks and 50 warplanes 
at the same time the national outlay for defense will be 
reduced by 10 percent honecker said 
honecker said the cuts would be completed by the end of 1990 to 
give the east german army an even more defensive character 
the surprise move follows an announcement by soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev last month that the kremlin was reducing its 
own troop strength including in eastern europe 
nato officials have welcomed gorbachevs initiative but maintain 
that the warsaw pact would still retain superiority in conventional 
forces in europe 
east germany has about 120000 soldiers 3000 main battle tanks 
and 350 combat aircraft according to estimates by the north 
atlantic treaty organization 
honecker said the tanks will either be destroyed or converted for 
civilian use he did not elaborate 
gorbachev in a speech to the united nations in december said 
the soviets would be pulling 50000 men and 5000 tanks from east 
germany czechoslovakia and hungary over the next two years it is 
believed the soviets have 500000 troops in that region 
hungary announced earlier this year that it will cut defense 
spending by 17 percent in real terms compared with 1988 and poland 
announced plans to cut military outlays 
eastwest negotiations on reducing conventional forces in europe 
are to begin in march in vienna 
in west germany a highranking soviet official on monday 
repeated kremlin calls for removal of shortrange or battlefield 
nuclear weapons from europe but acknowledged such a development 
could take time 
valentin falin head of the international section of the soviet 
communist party central committee also indicated moscow does not 
believe the berlin wall will be torn down soon 
one single atomic weapon undermines europes chance to 
survive falin said in an interview with the colognebased 
deutschlandfunk radio 
nato officials say withdrawing shortrange weapons would leave

president bush telephoned chancellor 
helmut kohl on monday and thanked the west german leader for his 
determination to prevent german companies from helping produce 
chemical weapons kohls spokesman said 
it was bushs first overseas conversation with a nato ally since 
taking office said friedhelm ost kohls chief spokesman 
bush called kohl to thank him for the best wishes the west german 
chancellor relayed when bush was sworn in on friday ost said 
but bush and kohl also discussed a scandal that has strained 
usgerman relations and led to investigations of several west 
german companies allegedly involved in what us officials say is a 
chemical weapons plant in libya 
ost said that bush thanked kohl for his determination to 
prevent the development and production of chemical weapons through 
german assistance 
according to ost bush also said he regretted commentaries in 
american newspapers that harshly criticized west germany over the 
libyan scandal 
ost said bush told kohl the commentaries failed to take into 
account the west german governments efforts to prevent the 
production of chemical weapons 
kohl told bush about the concrete steps the west german 
government is taking to completely resolve all accusations against 
german companies and individuals involved in the scandal ost said 
allegations that west german companies were involved in the 
libyan complex first appeared in us newspapers 
kohl and other west german leaders at the time expressed anger 
over what they called a news media campaign against their 
government creating tensions between washington and bonn 
but west german leaders since have acknowledged that several 
german firms were involved in the libyan plant although they say no 
proof has yet been found that any of the companies broke this 
countrys export laws 
west german officials say some of the companies may have been 
unwitting participants in the libyan project or may not have known 
the purpose of the factory 
libya denies american claims that the factory in rabta 60 miles 
south of tripoli is intended for chemical weapons and say it is 
designed to make pharmaceuticals

the justice department filed suit monday to 
enjoin the involuntary transfer of white teachers within a maryland 
public school district to achieve racially balanced faculties 
the suit by the departments civil rights division marked the 
first time the federal government had gone to court to attack 
teacher transfer programs said spokesman mark r weaver 
the justice department charged the prince georges county school 
system the nations 16th largest was violating title vii of the 
civil rights act of 1964 by making teacher assignments according to 
race 
the suit filed in us district court in baltimore charged the 
suburban washington school system was establishing applying and 
maintaining racial quotas for teacher and professional certificated 
employees in a manner that unlawfully discriminates on the basis of 
race 
specifically the suit charged that five white teachers were 
transferred to other schools instead of less senior black teachers 
who taught the same subjects 
the court action came more than a month after the department 
warned the school system in a letter by thenassistant attorney 
general william bradford reynolds that the transfer policy violated 
federal civil rights laws 
the warning to prince georges school officials was the last 
official act taken by reynolds before he resigned ending a 
controversial tenure as head of the departments civil rights 
division 
weaver said the department was unaware of any similar 
teachertransfer policies in other public school systems 
the spokesman said that the the investigation was prompted by 
complaints from white teachers in prince georges county 
school officials have defended the racial quotas for a 
publicschool system in which 62 percent of the students and 30 
percent of the teachers are black 
the racial quota to ensure that minority teachers make up between 
35 percent and 50 percent of a schools faculty was implemented to 
comply with a federal court desegration order school officials say 
the lawsuit also attacked as illegal a provision of the school 
districts labormanagement agreement that limits to 30 the number 
of paid sick days women teachers can claim due to disability from 
pregnancy 
the department contended that the policy was discriminatory 
because the school system generally allows unlimited sick leave for 
other medical conditions according to the suit

white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush usually works 
past 5 pm whereas reagan left an hour or so earlier 
bush warned his aides that their jobs would be a timeconsuming 
killer and said the lights burn brightly well after dark around 
this place he said he hoped their spouses would understand 
all of bushs cabinet still awaits confirmation but they were 
summoned to the white house for their first official meeting and 
group photo they were briefed on the budget and foreign policy as 
well as his mandate for high ethical standards fitzwater said

the cabinet meeting chief of staff john sununu discussed major 
themes and initiatives to be taken in the weeks ahead 
secretary of statedesignate james baker gave an overview of 
foreign policy telling his colleagues that were going to be very 
busy but we start with a strong hand and a strong america 
making good on a promise bush refused to answer reporters 
questions during the phototaking session with the cabinet i 
think its a better system this way he said adding that he would 
be available in other forums 
following a practice adopted by reagan bush spoke by telephone 
hookup in the oval office to tens of thousand of antiabortion 
demonstrators on the ellipse near the white house

to share with you my deep personal concern about our american 
tragedy of abortion on demand he said the supreme courts 
decision legalizing abortion was wrong and should be overturned 
bush who saw the reagan administrations reputation tarnished by 
questions of ethical lapses told his staff he wanted them to set a 
high standard of conduct 
he said the guidelines should be pride honesty spirit of 
idealism when it comes to public service knowing that our actions 
must always be of the highest integrity 
its a question of knowing right from wrong avoiding conflicts 
of interest bending over backwards to see that theres not even a 
perception of conflict of interest bush said 
fitzwater said bush was not trying to draw a contrast with the 
reagan administration on ethics he simply wants to do it his way 
and make the points that he feels are important he is familiar 
with the difficulty of inspiring and insuring ethical conduct among 
an organization as vast as the 2million person government 
he simply wants to be on the record and clear about his 
feelings from day one fitzwater said 
fitzwater said bush would give a similar charge this week to the 
bureaucrats in the senior executive service and to the inspectors

leaders to thank them for sending messages of congratulations he 
also expressed interest in cooperating with them in the quest for

gorbachev british prime minister margaret thatcher west german 
chancellor helmut kohl italian prime minister ciriaca demita and

said 
bush invited japanese prime minister noboru takeshita to visit 
the white house on feb 2 in what likely will be the first meeting 
with a foreign leader fitzwater said the selection was a 
demonstration of a commitment for good usjapanese relations and 
would pave the way for bushs visit to tokyo for the feb 24 funeral 
of emperor hirohito 
fitzwater said bush is considering visiting other countries when 
he goes to japan but no decision has been made 
fitzwater made clear that bush will be more unpredictable than 
reagan and said the new president does not feel bound to take a 
press pool with him whenever he leaves the white house he does 
intend to go by himself to do private things fitzwater said 
the press secretary said he would try to have bush accompanied by 
the press whenever there is a scheduled event or official 
appearance however he added we simply dont know who the 
presidents going to conduct his life well just have to play 
his schedule by ear

some city officials called mondays us 
supreme courts decision to strike down a program aimed at helping 
businesses owned by minorities a dark day for human relations 
but councilwoman carolyn c wake welcomed the decision saying 
i think justice has been done 
the supreme court ruled 63 that a city ordinance aimed at 
helping construction businesses owned by minorities was an unlawful 
form of reverse discrimination the ordinance required the prime 
contractor on any city building contract to subcontract at least 30 
percent of the value of the project to firms that are at least 
onehalf minority owned 
the ordinance was challenged in 1987 by ja croson co an ohio 
firm that was the only bidder on a city project but failed to get 
the job because it lacked a minority subcontractor 
the decision marks a dark day for the city a dark day for the 
country and a dark day for human relations councilman roy a west 
said 
the case will have farreaching effects because 36 states and 
about 190 local governments have similar programs said city manager 
robert c bobb 
under the ordinance up to 40 percent of the citys construction 
contracting jobs were awarded to minorities bobb said but since 
1987 when the ordinance was struck down by the 4th us circuit 
court of appeals less than 1 percent of the contracts awarded have 
been to minorities he said 
unless legislation requires the contractors to seek out 
minorities the majority firms are going to continue to work with 
those firms they have longterm business relationships with he 
said 
richmond attorney walter h ryland who represented croson said 
mondays decision was the high courts first affirmative action 
vote with a majority vote on significant issues 
an important part of the opinion is the fact that there will 
have to be more attention paid to whether the individual has been 
identified as a victim of discrimination ryland said 
the decision does not prohibit localities from voluntarily 
engaging in efforts to end discrimination said ryland the court 
stopped short of saying you can never do it 
mrs wake who voted against the ordinance in 1983 when it was 
approved said legislating the marketplace is dangerous 
i will work to open the marketplace up to everyone but then 
you have to let the marketplace speak she said thats what 
america was built on and i feel its working minorities are 
becoming a very vibrant part of the marketplace and i believe they 
will continue to 
councilman henry l marsh iii said that after council members 
have read the decision they may try to approve another ordinance 
that would meet the courts requirement 
obviously one of the options available to the city is to adopt 
a program that meets the constitutional test of the courts bobb 
said until we have an opportunity to review the decision we have 
no way to know what the legislation might look like

south africa said monday it is 
willing to cut its police force in namibia by 2300 officers and it 
named two representatives to help coordinate the territorys 
transition to independence 
at the united nations the organization of african unity and the 
nonaligned nations protested any reduction of a proposed 
7500member un peacekeeping force to oversee the transition the 
oau expressed worry over south africas security forces in namibia 
a report from secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar to the 
security council on his recommendations for the size of the 
peacekeeping force is due tuesday said un spokesman francois 
giuliani 
south africa has ruled namibia also known as southwest africa 
for 74 years it has agreed to begin implementing a un 
independence plan for africas last colony on april 1 leading to 
elections nov 1 
south african foreign minister pik botha said sunday evening that 
his country informed perez de cuellar that the namibian police force 
could be cut from 8300 to 6000 during the transition period 
before bothas announcement south africa had said it would 
reduce the police presence to 7000 botha said the revision was 
made after a thorough analysis of the security requirements 
south africa also has an estimated 50000 soldiers in namibia but 
is required to reduce the figure to 1500 by the end of june under 
the un plan 
botha said monday that health minister willie van niekerk was 
chosen to serve as a coordinator between south africa and the 
various groups in namibia those organizations and individuals 
include the current interim government the south africanappointed 
administrator general and the un special representative to 
namibia marthi ahtisaari 
willem retief south africas ambassador to west germany has 
been named special envoy to namibia and will assist van niekerk 
botha said 
the united nations in 1966 revoked south africas league of 
nations mandate to govern namibia 
since then the southwest africa peoples organization has been 
waging a guerrilla conflict for independence the group is widely 
regarded as the favorite to capture the november elections 
black african nations and nonaligned countries want the united 
nations to dispatch 7500 troops at a cost of about 700 million 
however the permanent members of the un security council 
including the united states will pay most of the cost and want to 
limit the force to about 4500 soldiers 
the 101member nonaligned nations group on monday adopted a 
statement saying the proposed reductions were contrary to the 
letter and spirit of a security council resolution calling for 
costsaving measures that do not threaten the peacekeepers ability 
to perform their mission 
a buildup in south african security forces in the last 10 years 
underlies the concern of the nonaligned and the organization of 
african unity which released a similar statement monday 
the oau statement expressed concern over a cut to 4000 
peacekeepers while the nonaligned spoke of a cut to 4500 troops 
both figures have been discussed as compromises in the past few 
weeks

convicted spy jonathan pollard began a 
fiveday fast monday to protest what he said was improper medical 
treatment for his imprisoned wife pollards fatherinlaw said 
pollard imprisoned at the federal penitentiary in marion was 
angered by the transfer of his wife anne from a danbury conn 
hospital to a federal prison medical facility at rochester minn 
said mrs pollards father bernard henderson 
pollard 34 was sentenced in 1987 to life in prison after he was 
convicted of supplying classified us documents to israeli agents 
his wife 28 was given a fiveyear sentence as an accessory to her 
husbands illegal possession of the documents 
randy davis assistant to the warden at marion said federal 
privacy regulations barred him from confirming whether pollard had 
begun a fast 
mrs pollard collapsed jan 11 at a federal prison work camp at 
danbury her father said in a telephone interview from new york city 
she was taken to a hospital for treatment of malnutrition 
dehydration and other symptoms of a gastrointestinal disorder that 
left her unable to digest food without the aid of medication he 
said 
henderson claimed his daughter was moved from the hospital jan 
14 before treatments for the disorder had been completed an action 
he called reckless endangerment of her life he also said she 
has been denied treatment since her transfer to the minnesota 
facility 
gregory bogdan a spokesman for the us bureau of prisons said 
mrs pollard was moved for medical reasons and denied that she 
was being mistreated 
she is receiving all the appropriate treatment bodgan said 
from washington dc it just was felt that she would be more 
appropriately cared for at rochester 
henderson also said his daughter was placed on an 
aroundtheclock suicide watch at the minnesota facility as a 
means of harassing her and that a jewish religious symbol had 
been taken from her during the transfer 
bogdan said privacy rules prevent him from commenting on specific 
aspects of mrs pollards medical treatment he said he was unaware 
of the alleged theft 
henderson said pollard would take only water for the next five 
days to protest his wifes treatment adding that prison officials 
had threatened to forcefeed pollard if he embarked on an indefinite 
hunger strike 
its the only way pollard has to protest this said 
henderson he cant do anything else 
bogdan said bureau of prisons policy calls for intervention in a 
hunger strike if a prisoner fasts to a point where he is 
endangering his own safety 
pollard voluntarily ended a fourday hunger strike in july that 
he began because he believed his attorneys were being barred from 
visiting him

a jury sentenced a convicted multiple 
murderer to death monday for the slaying of a 19yearold woman more 
than five years ago the second time he has been sentenced to die 
for the crime 
the jury returned the death sentence against richard biegenwald 
after six hours of deliberations the state supreme court had 
overturned his first death sentence for the slaying of anna 
olesiewicz because of trial errors and ordered him resentenced by a 
new jury 
superior court judge patrick mcgann ordered biegenwald be 
executed by lethal injection on march 15 
however that date will be postponed because all death sentences 
must automatically be reviewed by the state supreme court lawyers 
in capital cases have predicted it will be at least six years before 
the first new jersey death row inmate is executed 
in addition to the olesiewicz murder biegenwald was convicted of 
one other murder and pleaded guilty to two murders of young women 
in the monmouthocean area during the early 1980s prosecutors also 
suspect biegenwald in a fifth slaying 
in his summation assistant monmouth county prosecutor james 
fagen characterized biegenwald as evil and a coldblooded 
murderer 
he noted that biegenwald was sentenced to life for a murder 
conviction in 1959 but murdered again when he was released on 
parole 
fagen said biegenwald had no motive adding that testimony from 
theresa smith the defendants former lover showed all this man 
had on his mind was killing killing killing 
new jersey law requires one trial to determine guilt or innocence 
and a second trial to determine if a convicted murderer should 
receive the death penalty 
biegenwald 48 is the first to go through a second death penalty 
trial under new jerseys 7yearold capital punishment law 
defense attorney louis diamond said biegenwalds beatings as a 
child and the harsh treatment he received in pyschiatric hospitals 
including electroshock therapy taught him that life is 
meaningless death is meaningless 
the defense attorney said that if allowed to live biegenwald 
could be of value to society if studied by psychiatrists who could 
possibly find a cause for sociopathic behavior from his case

a business professor held hostage in 
beruit for 20 months said monday the collapse of lebanese 
governmental and economic institutions led to his kidnapping in 1986 
mithileshwar singh 61 said he hopes president bush will direct 
an effort to resolve the problems in lebanon that have brought 
the kidnappings of americans and other foreigners in the strifetorn 
country 
harmony cannot be gained through terrorism and the seizing of 
hostages but i do ask the governments to show more consideration 
of conditions in beruit singh said 
he said his captors have very little consideration for the 
freedom of people we were not allowed to go out of the room their 
attitude was very commanding it was be a good hostage dont go 
over the limit set by us 
singh said he wouldnt speculate on who was funding the group 
that held him prisoner 
he also declined to answer questions about escape attempts by him 
or other hostages i would not like to comment at all about 
this he said 
the political process has come to a halt and there is no one to 
provide safety and security to the millions of people living in the 
country said singh who was released by the islamic jihad on oct 
3 
singh who taught at a nowdefunct college in grand junction for 
several years and calls the western colorado city home was teaching 
at the american university of beirut when he was abducted jan 24 
1986 
a citizen of india singh has been a resident alien in the united 
states for more than a decade he said pressure from the indian 
government coupled with his age and poor health were the likely 
reasons for his release 
you can say there is no government in lebanon economic 
institutions are falling apart singh said in such a chaotic 
condition the country has become further subdivided into factions 
as a result of many factions competing for control of the 
country he said his kidnappers were able to pose as security 
guards at the university 
singh said he and about eight other foreign instructors were 
invited to a meeting jan 24 1986 by the chief of campus security 
they were to discuss strengthened security and meet new guards hired 
by the campus chief singh said 
instead singh and the three other male instructors were 
handcuffed at gunpoint and driven to an apartment the first of 10 
places he would be held before he was released 
our treatment was to some extent acceptable but some of the 
conditions were intolerable and even indescribable he said 
the captives were kept chained to the floor most of the time 
singh said they were freed only for bathroom trips and for transfer 
to other apartments 
this caused great emotional and physical hardship he said 
however singh said his captors provided medicine he and other 
hostages needed for medical problems and brought him a doctor when 
he fell greatly sick

paraded by on cable cars 
coach bill walsh clutched the super bowl trophy in his hands as 
he sat in an open car next to mayor art agnos while the parade 
streamed down its route along the historic market street 
quarterback joe montana most valuable player jerry rice and 
their teammates waved from the cable cars as dozens of police 
motorcycles and squad cars flanked the procession lights flashing 
fans peered from office windows lining the route and jammed 20 or 
more deep behind police barricades confetti floated down on the 
procession as it crept along 
earlymorning rain threatened to put a damper on the homecoming 
but the skies cleared for the cable cars and convertibles carrying 
the victors 
mondays parade capped a celebration that began sunday evening 
when montana threw a touchdown pass to john taylor with 34 seconds 
remaining in super bowl xxiii 
that produced a 2016 victory over cincinnati the 49ers third 
championship of the 1980s 
with the 49ers at the last minute under pressure we knew we 
had to win said justina valencia 19 who wore a red 49ers

emotional revelry 
i knew in my heart it would be no 1 niners in 89 we dont 
give up were no miami mice 
sundays celebration was marred by some bottlethrowing and 
fights and rowdy drunkards accounted for many of the 90 arrests 
police reported said sgt jerry senkir

streets kissed strangers exchanged high fives honked their horns 
and forced police to close a highway and many city blocks

gov buddy roemer warned monday that if 
former ku klux klansman david duke is elected to the louisiana 
legislature the states image would suffer a blow 
what a terrible signal that would send roemer said about the 
possibility of duke winning a feb 18 runoff for a house seat from a 
new orleans suburb 
duke founded the national association for the advancement of 
white people after leaving the klan in 1980 
in a primary saturday duke and fellow republican john treen 
brother of former gov dave treen were the leaders for the runoff 
with duke getting 33 percent of the vote to 19 percent for treen 
the district in metairie a suburban community of new orleans is 
a stronghold for conservative republicans 
if it would be a bad image for louisiana to elect a former 
klansman the us senate is guilty of promoting a bad image for the 
nation duke said they elected a former klansman in senator 
robert byrd to head up the ultraliberal democratic party 
byrd the former senate majority leader was a member of the klan 
briefly when he was in his 20s said his press secretary tina evans 
on monday he joined because he believed it was an anticommunist 
organization and he has since called it a youthful mistake that he 
regrets she said 
asked about the election results at an impromptu news conference 
roemer paused and said ill just speak personally now let me 
take all of my others hats off i would be very upset if that duke 
victory happened 
but i tell you the people are going to have to make that 
decision generally they make the right decisions i just hope 
they look it over very carefully 
duke said hes not a racist and its unfair that his past as an 
imperial wizard in the knights of the ku klux klan is brought up 
whenever hes mentioned 
i was never involved in the old jim crow system he said i 
believe in equal rights for everyone thats what ive advocated 
thats what ive preached thats what i believe in 
his proposal for incentives to get welfare recipients to accept 
sterilization to cut the illegitimate birthrate wasnt a racial 
issue he said 
the media reported it as black illegitimate welfare ive only 
said illegitimate duke said theyre the ones who suppose 
illegitimate welfare recipients are black 
although a telephone listing for the klan still rings at his 
home he said thats just to make it easier to find him 
if hes been disassociated for 10 years why would he have the 
klan number at his address treen said if id been 
disassociated from an organization for 10 years i dont think id 
be paying its phone bill 
roemer said he discussed the primary results with several people 
but nobody is sure if duke hit his maximum strength with the 33 
percent of the vote 
what can i do roemer said i think the worst thing would 
be for somebody to meddle in the affairs of that district ive 
always been very sensitive to that 
roemer a democrat with a strong civil rights background said he 
would help republican treen with strategy or a shoulder to lean on 
or information

the policeman whose fatal shooting of a black 
motorcyclist sparked last weeks racial violence was arrested monday 
and charged with manslaughter only hours after the young mans 
funeral 
meanwhile the justice departments civil rights division began 
an investigation into the shooting and a city panel formed to 
review the incident complained it did not have sufficient power 
officer william lozano 29 was booked into dade county jail on 
two counts of manslaughter and released after posting 10000 bond 
said sgt arthur clemons 
lozano was charged in the killings of clement lloyd 23 and 
allan blanchard 24 the two were speeding on a motorcycle jan 16 
in overtown when lozano allegedly shot lloyd in the head lloyd died 
at the scene and blanchard his passenger died the next day from 
injuries suffered in the ensuing crash 
dade county state attorney janet reno said a thorough 
investigation found that murder charges were unwarranted 
based on the evidence and applicable florida law manslaughter 
is the correct charge reno said lozano could face up to 60 years 
in prison and a 30000 fine if found guilty on both charges she 
said 
only hours before lozanos arrest about 150 relatives and 
friends of lloyd gathered for his funeral at the small bahman avenue 
church of god in opalocka 
as martin luther king said we live together as rational human 
beings or die together as fools not only in miami but all over 
america the rev morris lloyd the victims uncle said in his 
eulogy until something is done to correct our injustices i 
believe a lot more lives are going to be lost 
lloyds mother and other family members most immigrants from the 
virgin islands wept and cried out as the mourners sang rock of 
ages 
the rev dennis archibald pastor of the church noted that the 
killing occurred on kings birthday 
it is ironic that clement should be gunned down on the very 
day we celebrate the birthday of the founder of the civil rights 
movement he said 
the poor are becoming increasingly frustrated because their needs 
are not being addressed he warned the only language they know 
when they are not heard is violence 
two federal prosecutors from the criminal section of the justice 
departments civil rights division were sent to miami to investigate 
lloyds death spokesman mark r weaver said in washington 
the investigators plan to impanel a grand jury this week to study 
possible criminal charges against the hispanic police officer 
allegedly involved in the shooting said a government source in 
washington 
i cant confirm that there will be a grand jury this week but 
i can tell you we are moving expeditiously weaver said 
an 11member independent review panel of police officers and 
black leaders established by the city commission after the rioting 
held its first working session monday in the nowquiet overtown 
neighborhood where lloyd was killed a week ago the shooting ignited 
three days of looting and violence 
city attorney jorge fernandez told panel members that a statute 
protecting the rights of police officers along with conflicting 
state and federal investigations meant that while the review board 
can subpoena witnesses many can legally refuse to testify 
then if we listen carefully to the statute the policemans 
bill of rights we really have no power at all said the rev 
richard barry chairman of the panel come on now lets talk 
plain talk not lawyers talk 
the review board is scheduled to make a preliminary report to the 
commission thursday and members said they want to look more broadly 
at underlying social problems in overtown 
in the overtown rioting that followed lloyds shooting one man 
died and 11 other people were wounded by gunfire none seriously 
fire officials said about 1 million damage was done to structures 
but reports were still being gathered on destruction to building 
contents and businesses 
an apparent new police shooting overnight in the nearby black 
neighborhood of liberty city where one man had died in looting 
during the rioting was under investigation by metrodade police 
the victim david ford 20 who allegedly was armed was in 
stable condition monday at jackson memorial hospital suffering from 
two gunshot wounds police spokeswoman lucy fitts said investigators 
were not certain if he was shot by officer paul chahal 26 or by a 
second suspect who escaped 
police initially said chahal returned fire at a sniper shooting 
at police but ms fitts said the shots may not have been aimed at 
the officers 
we still dont know what happened she said were waiting 
for ballistics tests 
the community remained quiet after the incident she said 
in the investigation of lloyds shooting miami police spokesman 
ray lang said that officer dawn campbell who was present when 
lozano fired at the motorcycle had given a complete statement to 
investigators 
blanchard the motorcycle passenger was buried saturday and his 
family called for peace in the community

salvador dali who was among the centurys 
most important painters and created a public image to match his 
surrealist art died monday in the town where he was born 84 years 
ago 
the melting watches and wasteland of his dreamscape persistence 
of memory made an indelible impression on contemporary culture it 
is probably the most celebrated of surrealist paintings 
equally identified with the divine dali as he liked to call 
himself were the pointed waxed mustache curling up like a bulls 
horns long hair and a walking stick of which he owned more than 30 
dali a founder of the surrealist movement was the last of an 
outstanding generation of spanish painters that included pablo 
picasso and joan miro 
he died at 1015 am at figueras hospital his physician dr 
charles ponsati said the cause of death was cardiac arrest 
brought on by his respiratory insufficiency and pneumonia 
dali had heart problems and had been confined to a wheelchair 
since suffering severe burns in a fire at his home in 1984 he was 
taken to the hospital five days before his death 
the painter was born may 11 1904 to a notary public in this 
small catalonian town after a life of flamboyance and eccentricity 
his lawyer miguel domenech said dali died softly without making 
any special last statement 
king juan carlos a personal friend sent condolences culture 
minister jorge semprun described dali as the last of a generation 
of creators who revolutionized art in our century 
what dali called his sublime craziness began early he was 
expelled from art school in 1926 for arrogance and briefly jailed 
because of political activities for catalonian autonomy 
after becoming famous dali said the only difference between a 
crazy person and me is the fact that i am not crazy 
he also said life would be practically impossible on the globe 
if there existed 20 or 30 dalis but there is nothing to fear that 
can never happen 
although few critics faulted dalis technical virtuosity they 
did not hold his work in the highest esteem most felt his was a 
flawed talent sometimes managing to balance realistic technique and 
irrational content but too often caught up in his own role as a 
poseurpainter 
most of dalis critically successful works were completed before 
he was 35 
whatever the critics thought the public adored dali who also 
was a decorator fashion and jewelry designer and author 
a major retrospective in 197980 attracted more than a million 
visitors in paris and 250000 in london 
after being kicked out of the school of fine arts in madrid dali 
went to paris and became involved with the surrealists who sought 
the real world in the realm of the unconscious and dreams 
dali made his cinematic mark as coproducer with another 
spaniard luis bunuel of the 1929 short film an andalusian dog 
the style and visual violence set a new standard in avantgarde 
cinema 
when he claimed surrealism is me dalis exhibitionism and 
egocentrism became too much for his associates 
at the end of the spanish civil war in 1939 he was drummed out of 
the movement as a phony and archfranquist dilettante dali 
made no secret of his support for gen francisco franco who won the 
war and ruled spain for 36 years 
in paris on monday painter georges mathieu a friend said dali 
was more important as a cosmic genius than as a painter 
jack lang french culture minister said dali created pictoral 
work of great philosophical significance while at the same time 
making himself known to a vast public 
kirk varnedoe director of painting and sculpture at the museum 
of modern art in new york said dali created some of the most 
unforgettable imagery associated with the surrealist movement but 
may be even more enduringly remembered as a showman 
varnedoe spoke of dalis extraordinary theatrical instincts 
and said for those who are concerned with the intermingling in 
modern art of the scandalous and the playful or of psychological 
revelation and gadfly irritation dali will always be an exemplary 
figure 
with a loan from picasso in 1934 dali made his first trip to the 
united states with gala dimitrovna diaharoff the russianborn woman 
who became his companion muse and the touchstone of his personality 
and life 
she met dali in 1929 when she and her husband french surrealist 
poet paul eluard visited the painter at his seaside home in 
northeastern spain 
at dalis request she never left and they married in 1958 six 
years after eluards death 
they had no children dali said geniuses always produced mediocre 
children he said gala was the woman who always inspired me 
without her everything would be over 
gala died june 10 1982 and afterward the painter said he chose 
to remain inside the castle they had built 
two years later a mysterious electrical fire started while dali 
slept sending him to the hospital and bringing to public attention 
what many termed his near imprisonment by three close associates 
a reynolds morse founder of the salvador dali museum in st 
petersburg fla and an acquaintance of long standing said at the 
time the three had refused him entrance to the castle 
after the fire dali moved into the galatea tower of his 
theatermuseum in figueras and remained there confined to a 
wheelchair and fed through a tube he received a heart pacemaker in 
1986 
the highest price paid for a dali was 23 million by a japanese 
buyer paid in 1987 for a 197476 oil on canvas gala looking at 
the mediterranean sea which from a distance of 20 meters is 
transformed into a portrait of abraham lincoln homage to rothko 
that pales beside the 3846 million paid for a picasso in 
november but dali admitted that from 1964 on he began signing blank 
sheets of paper resulting in a proliferation of dali fakes 
his estate has been estimated at nearly 90 million 
his body was returned monday to the galatea tower where his 
housekeeper said thousands of people had gathered the funeral is 
scheduled for wednesday and dali will be buried in the 
theatermuseums inner court beneath a great glass dome crowning 
the building

for the fourth time in 21 months 
residents of this south american country watched with curiosity 
disbelief and anger as violence at an army base threatened their 
5yearold democracy 
this time it was not soldiers who challenged the government but 
civilian commandos the government said were leftist guerrillas 
the risk for argentina is being caught in pincers between the 
left and the right said juan manuel cassella the vice 
presidential candidate of the ruling radical civic union in the 
elections set for next may 14 
the assault called to mind not the military insurrections of 
april 1987 and january and december 1988 but attacks in the late 
1960s and 1970s on army bases by leftist guerrillas such as the 
montoneros and the peoples revolutionary army 
the commandos either carried with them or stole and put to use 
groundtoground missiles and antitank guns military officials 
said in explaining how 30 to 50 commandos held off hundreds of 
soldiers and police backed by tanks and mortars for more than 15 
hours 
in january 1974 about 100 peoples revolutionary army guerrillas 
tried to take over the 10th armored cavalry arsenal at azul 248 
miles south of buenos aires the attack was repulsed 
in december 1975 the same group attacked battalion 601 in monte 
chingolo 9 miles northwest of the capital 
erp as the socalled revolutionary army is known by its spanish 
acronym and the montoneros formed in the late 1960s to oppose the 
military regime then in power 
their assassinations bombings and kidnappings continued under 
the elected government of juan domingo peron in 1973 destabilizing 
it and setting the stage for the military coup of march 1976 
the new military rulers met the leftist subversion headon 
fighting erp guerrillas in the mountains of northwest tucuman 
province at least 8900 argentines were arrested by security forces 
and never seen again they are presumed executed 
that socalled dirty war divides argentine society to this 
day military officers charged with human rights abuses say they 
used unconventional tactics including torture to deal with an 
unconventional threat human rights groups said the armed forces 
committed genocide 
five members of the three juntas that ruled from 1976 until 
president raul alfonsins election in october 1983 were convicted of 
human rights abuses and sentenced to long terms in prison 
about 20 officers are under prosecution 
the leaders of the three military insurrections cashiered lt 
col aldo rico and col mohamed ali seineldin demanded that those 
officers convicted be given an amnesty and trials for the others 
called off 
the government and the opposition peronist party have refused 
both demands rico and seineldin currently are in military prison 
awaiting trial 
all three insurrections ended with little shooting or bloodshed

iraq released 131 sick and disabled iranian 
prisoners of war and the red cross flew them back to tehran where a 
un mediator arrived on a mission to revive stalled peace talks 
iran offered no immediate sign that it would reciprocate and 
resume prisoner exchanges that ended two months ago but iraq said 
it planned to free 124 more iranians on tuesday 
the arrival monday in tehran of the iranian pows was noted in a 
brief report by irans official islamic republic news agency 
baghdad pressed by world bodies has relented and set free a 
group of iranian disabled prisoners of war said the agency 
monitored in nicosia cyprus 
officials with the international committee of the red cross 
supervised the return of the prisoners to tehran in an airliner 
chartered by the genevabased agency 
red cross spokesman juerg bischoff said there is no indication 
the exchange of all sick and wounded prisoners will be resumed soon 
he said the release of the 131 on monday followed a unilateral 
decision by iraq 
he said it came outside a nov 11 agreement which provided for 
the immediate return of 1569 registered pows to be followed by the 
repatriation of all other sick and wounded by the end of last year 
the accord broke down nov 27 because of a dispute over the number 
of prisoners to be repatriated 
fiftysix iranian and 155 iraqi pows were freed before the 
exchange broke down 
andries qun head of the red cross mission in baghdad told 
reporters at the airport that red cross officials had also examined 
and interviewed the prisoners he said all were in good condition 
he did not elaborate but all the pows apparently indicated that 
they wanted to be returned home 
im very happy to be going home said amosh toosi 35 who 
said he was captured in the southern battlefront in the early days 
of the war 
the war was terrible i was only told a few days ago that i was 
to be repatriated said toosi a medical student in the southern 
city of shiraz before the war 
un special envoy jan eliasson swedens ambassador to the world 
body was greeted at tehrans mehrabad airport on mondasy by iranian 
foreign ministry officials the islamic republic news agency 
reported 
an englishlanguage iranian newspaper said in an editorial monday 
that the deadlocked peace process may take a turn for the worse if 
no breakthrough happens soon 
we do not know whether mr eliasson is bringing new proposals 
for breaking the ice or whether he will try to persuade iran and 
iraq on the same old lines it quoted the editorial as saying 
after his talks in iran eliasson will travel to baghdad jan 27 
to discuss the unsponsored peace negotiations with iraqi 
officials said irna 
a unmediated ceasefire in the persian gulf war took effect 
aug 20 but peace talks that opened in geneva five days later under 
un auspices broke down immediately two more rounds of talks 
failed to resolve the deadlock over troop pullouts to prewar borders 
un security council resolution 598 calls on iran and iraq to 
halt all military activities and honor the truce withdraw 
troops to prewar borders exchange around 100000 prisoners of war 
and start peace talks 
the red cross has registered 50182 iraqi prisoners held by iran 
and 19284 iranians in iraqi camps but un and other officials 
estimate the number is far higher and could reach 100000 held by 
both sides

the leader of a marxist palestinian group 
said in an interview published monday that plo chief yasser arafat 
has made too many concessions in his bid to create a palestinian 
state 
george habash who heads the damascusbased popular front for the 
liberation of palestine the main opposition faction within the plo 
also was quoted as saying the plos new dialogue with the united 
states is bound to fail but he said he will not try to split the 
palestine liberation organization 
advocates of freeofcharge concessions will find out that this 
policy will lead them nowhere habash said in a fullpage 
interview with the leftist beirut newspaper assafir 
so we are betting that within a year or say a few months they 
will realize that their policy will not lead to the creation of a 
palestinian state he was quoted as saying 
the freeof cost concessions include arafats explicit 
recognition of israels right to exist within secure boundaries on 
palestinian territory and his renunciation of terrorism the 
newspaper quoted habash as saying 
these moves violated the resolutions of the palestine national 
council taken in its meetings in algiers in november he was 
quoted as saying 
the council the plos parliamentinexile recommended an 
implicit recognition of israel and a renunciation of terrorism that 
also stresses that the palestinians are freedom fighters habash 
was quoted as saying 
habash broke with arafat in 1974 over the issue of a palestinian 
state but the two later reconciled habash now acts as an 
opposition spokesman within the plo criticizing arafat but abiding 
by the councils decisions 
it was not until arafat announced his explicit recognition of 
israel and outright condemnation of terrorism at a un assembly 
session in geneva dec 14 that the united states instructed its 
ambassador to tunisia robert pelletreau to open a dialogue with 
the plo 
asked about his expections for usplo dialogue habash said 
simply failure assafir reported 
but the newspaper reported habash still pledged support for 
arafat and said his faction would not leave the plo 
the uprising is the main common denominator that binds arafat 
and us we shall allow nothing to weaken the uprising habash was 
quoted as saying 
he was referring to the 13monthold uprising in the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip more than 360 
palestinians and 15 israelis have been killed since the revolt began 
dec 8 1987 
the newspaper said habash also backed arafats declaration at 
algiers of an independent state of palestine although its 
boundaries have not been defined the west bank and gaza would be 
included 
a palestinian state on even 10 percent of palestinian soil is 
apt to explode a civil war within israel habash was quoted as 
saying 
assafir said he predicted that arafat might make more 
concessions so that the symbolic palestinian state could become a 
reality 
arafat might accept a demilitarized state and might accept 
israeli settlements to remain habash was quoted as saying he 
also might compromise on the plo demand that arab jerusalem be the 
capital of the palestinian state 
but the newspaper quoted habash as saying it was difficult to 
visualize arafat abandoning his quest to lead a fullscale state 
with a national flag and a seat at the united nations 
it said habash also called on palestinians living inside out 
outside the israelioccupied territories to prevent the plo from 
being replaced by an official palestinian governmentinexile 
habash was quoted as saying that if a palestinian 
governmentinexile took over the plos policymaking role it might 
immediately begin negotiations with jordan to set up a confederation 
and then start direct peace talks with israel 
this will be a grave danger because direct negotiations will 
negate the current drive for arabisaeli peace settlement within an 
international conference on the middle east he was quoted as 
saying

jurors began deliberations monday in the trial of 
joel steinberg who is accused of beating to death his illegally 
adopted daughter in a case that stirred national debate about 
responsibility for reporting child abuse 
state supreme court justice harold rothwax finished his 
intructions to the jury shortly after noon telling the panel to 
consider lesser homicide charges only if they first acquit steinberg 
of murder 
steinberg 47 is charged in the death of 6yearold lisa 
steinberg the girl he obtained at birth from an unwed teenager but 
never legally adopted his lawyers charge that hedda nussbaum 46 
his battered livein companion delivered the fatal blow 
the jury ended its deliberations for the day after almost nine 
hours without reaching a verdict court officials said 
an alternate juror who was dismissed monday after she became ill 
said she would have voted to convict steinberg of murder 
i believed hedda said sharon rupert 50 i almost cried 
when she left the witness stand 
the other four alternate jurors were released shortly before the 
12 regular jurors were sent home for the night 
rothwax dismissed the alternates because he can not substitute 
one of them for one of the regular 12 jurors after the first day of 
deliberations without the consent of both the defense and the 
prosecution 
the jurys discussions are almost certain to include ms 
nussbaums seven days of testimony in december she testified for 
the prosecution that steinberg told her in bed after they 
freebased cocaine and while lisa lay comatose on their bathroom 
floor that he had knocked lisa down and she didnt want to get 
up 
but rothwax also told the jury hedda nussbaum is an accomplice 
as a matter of law meaning she can reasonably be considered to 
have participated in the offense charged 
as such the judge said ms nussbaums testimony must be 
supported by other testimony or evidence in the sensational domestic 
violence case or it would have to be put aside 
ms nussbaum initially charged with murder in lisas death made 
a deal with the prosecution to testify against steinberg and charges 
against her were dropped 
the prosecution maintains that ms nussbaum was too physically 
and emotionally incapacitated by 12 years of living with steinberg 
to have harmed lisa ms nussbaum testified that for most of those 
years steinberg beat her 
rothwax told the jurors that evidence that steinberg beat ms 
nussbaum is not proof he hit lisa 
you may not for example decide that the defendant is a bad 
man or is a violent person or has a violent disposition or 
propensity or is otherwise disposed to or more likely to have 
committed the crimes charged in the indictment of this ms 
nussbaums testimony the judge said 
rothwax has said in the past that steinberg could be convicted of 
murder even if they believe his lawyers assertions that he never 
hit the child the judge has not told the jury this 
the judge said steinberg could be convicted of murder if he did 
not actually hit lisa because he had a parental duty to see to her 
health and safety if the jury finds steinberg knew the child was in 
distress and he did not act then it could find he showed a 
depraved indifference to her life 
steinberg a disbarred lawyer maintained he returned home from 
dining out on nov 1 1987 to find lisa comatose it is undisputed 
that he virtually ignored her as she lay unconscious on their 
bathroom floor for several hours 
emergency medical service workers were not called to the couples 
greenwich village apartment until the following morning and the 
child died three days later 
lisas death in an affluent welleducated househould attracted 
wide attention and raised the issue of the responsibility of 
neighbors teachers and social workers to recognize and report 
evidence of child abuse 
steinbergs lawyers contend ms nussbaum attacked lisa in a 
jealous rage 
but assistant district attorney peter casolaro told the jury in 
his summation that it was steinberg drugged with cocaine and vexed 
by the childs growing rebelliousness who fatally beat lisa 
if the jurors believe steinberg did not hit the girl but they do 
not want to return a murder charge against him they can still 
consider first and seconddegree manslaughter and criminally 
negligent homicide 
firstdegree manslaughter applies when a person intends to hurt 
but not kill somebody but kills the person anyway conviction is 
punishable by up to 25 years in prison 
seconddegree manslaughter applies when a person knows or should 
know there is a substantial risk of death to others but ignores that 
risk 
criminally negligent homicide applies when a person negligently 
fails to see the risk of death to others and someone dies as a 
result

the supreme court refused monday night to block 
serial killer theodore bundys execution scheduled for tuesday 
morning in florida 
by votes of 54 72 and 63 the justices rejected emergency 
requests aimed at keeping bundy alive until a formal appeal could be 
filed with the nations highest court 
the justices had four times previously rejected formal appeals 
from bundy who is sentenced to die in floridas electric chair for 
murdering a 12yearold girl in lake city fla 11 years ago 
bundys lawyers on monday filed three separate emergency requests 
aimed at preventing the execution the argument which won the 
support of four justices argued that jurors were misled about the 
importance of their role in determining whether bundy would receive 
the death penalty or life in prison for his crime 
in florida juries in capital cases recommend a punishment but 
the presiding judge is free to accept or reject the recommendation 
justices william brennan thurgood marshall harry a blackmun 
and john paul stevens voted to spare bundys life the courts 
fivemember majority voted to let him die 
the votes rejecting the other two emergency appeals were 63 and 
72 
turned down 72 was a request to delay the execution until the 
high court could hear an appeal claiming that bundys death sentence 
was tainted because his lawyers were not shown all the information 
considered by the sentencing 
the 63 decision rejected a delay based on an alleged flaw which 
was almost identical to the argument rejected in the 54 vote

the government has decided secretly to 
bar the return of ferdinand marcos body if the ailing former 
president dies in exile in hawaii an opposition senator said monday 
sen juan ponce enrile told reporters that president corazon 
aquino and her advisers reached the decision during a recent meeting 
of the cabinet crisis committee he said his source was a cabinet 
member he refused to identify 
he said the panel decided that marcos 71 should not be 
allowed to return to the philippines and even if he should die 
that his cadaver should not be allowed to enter the philippines 
in honolulu a hospital spokeswoman said marcos was improving 
monday but remained in the intensive care unit he was hospitalized 
eight days ago suffering from pneumonia and bronchial asthma 
presidential spokesman teodoro benigno confirmed that the cabinet 
had discussed what to do in case marcos dies abroad 
asked whether the government agreed to bar the return of marcos 
body benigno replied i will not be dragged into that the 
national interest is the primary criterion for making decisions 
marcos has lived in hawaii since a popular uprising toppled his 
authoritarian administration in february 1986 and swept mrs aquino 
into power 
mrs aquino has repeatedly refused to allow marcos to return 
citing national security marcos was refused permission to come home 
for the funeral of his mother josefa who died may 4 
her body remains unburied and marcos supporters say the funeral 
has been delayed indefinitely pending their leaders return 
enrile who served as marcos defense minister for 15 years 
before helping engineer his downfall in 1986 said the decision to 
bar marcos body was made before the former president entered a 
honolulu hospital on jan 15 for the third time in little over a 
month 
he suffered a collapsed left lung last thursday and was reported 
later to be in guarded but stable condition at one point last week 
his lawyers said marcos was dying 
enrile said marcos wife imelda and spokesman gemmo trinidad 
telephoned him during the first week of january to enlist my help 
to help marcos come back enrile did not say if he favors a marcos 
return now 
sen aquilino pimentel who was jailed under the marcos 
administration said he knew of no decision to bar marcos body if 
true pimentel said there is an element of paranoia implicit in 
that decision 
i dont think marcos dead can overthrow the government 
pimentel added theres no question though that his coming home 
would be very emotional 
a us federal grand jury indicted marcos his wife imelda and 
eight other associates on oct 21 1988 on racketeering charges 
marcos faces 39 civil cases in manila 
about 2000 marcos supporters demonstrated in front of the us 
embassy in manila on monday carrying placards that said bring 
back marcos alive 
rafael recto a lawyer for marcos asked the bush administration 
to be compassionate and facilitate marcos return

for a teenager who attends high school in new 
mexico neil patrick harris has a rather impressive film career 
he costarred with whoopi goldberg in claras heart and was 
in the tv movie too good to be true with lonnie anderson and 
patrick duffy 
this sunday he costars with barnard hughes robert prosky and 
sada thompson in home fires burning a hallmark hall of fame 
presentation on cbs 
he plays lonnie tibbetts in this drama set in a small southern 
town at the end of world war ii hughes is his grandfather jake 
tibbetts ms thompson is his grandmother and prosky plays jakes 
best friend 
my fathers been in the war since i was a child harris said 
of his role hes coming home i live with my grandfather whos 
got a large grudge against my father my mother was killed and jake 
blames my father for the accident ive lived with my grandparents 
most of my life and i have to straighten out things between jake 
and my father 
harris was in los angeles with his parents who are lawyers in 
albuquerque to promote the show and interview for new projects 
they recently moved there from ruidoso nm 
unlike a lot of 15yearolds harris is completely at ease with 
people articulate and seemingly never at a loss for words 
he described lonnie as a quiet intelligent boy 
his grandpas almost his best friend he said hes close 
with his family but confused with his mother gone and his father in 
the war it affects him greatly hes curious he gets into trouble 
hes pretty much a normal kid 
home fires burning was filmed on location in crawfordville 
ga 
it was interesting because of the accents the food and the 
culture he said ive been on location four times and each 
time i had a different guardian i think once was enough for each of 
them so far its been my mother father grandma and my brother 
brian whos 18 
his first professional job was in an episode of the syndicated 
comedy series throb he was also in a movie called purple 
people eater with ned beatty and shelley winters 
it all began when i was 5 or 6 and living in ruidoso he 
said my folks took me to see the national road show of annie i 
fell in love with it i bought the soundtrack album and the music 
book i was going to be annie all i needed was a wig 
ive always loved to watch plays whenever im in la i go to 
the book stores to buy scripts of the latest plays i love plays i 
was john darling in peter pan in albuquerque i like the 
spontaneity of a play if you mess up you have to cover up and you 
always mess up and you cover up and you get applause every night 
as much as he wants to do a play harris recently turned down an 
opportunity to play jack of jack and the beanstalk in the road 
show of into the woods the voice required was too low for his 
range and it would have kept him away from home for six months 
i think i want to keep acting he said it tickles my 
fancy id like to try it as an adult im such a ham all the 
attention is great 
hes also turning down tv series offers until after he completes 
high school hes now a sophomore at lacueva high school in 
albuquerque 
i missed the first month of school he said my teachers 
have been very understanding my classmates have been wonderful 
too theyre amused and very accepting

sergeant joe friday has asked for just the 
facts in many ways over the years but this month hell try 
something really different interrogating bad guys in spanish 
dan aykroyd the star of the dragnet movie hasnt 
transferred to mexico city but hispanics in key cities north of the 
border can see a spanishlanguage version of dragnet on home box 
office 
some hbo subscribers will be able to choose whether to hear a 
spanish or english soundtrack to dragnet and several other hbo 
and cinemax features each month 
theres a very large hispanic population in this country about 
25 million people which is equal to the entire population of 
canada said hbo vice president dick beahrs whereas many of 
them speak english as well as spanish many of them welcome the 
opportunity to use their first language 
to hear the spanish dialogue a viewer must subscribe to a cable 
company using the spanish audio track and in most areas have a 
stereo tv with a second audio program switch a special audio 
decoder costing between 45 and 70 can be added to sets that 
dont have the switch 
there is no extra cost for the spanishlanguage feed 
twentyone cable systems in seven markets are taking the spanish 
audio with 20 more set to start before may according to hbos 
concepcion lara on board are some systems in and around los 
angeles san diego dallas el paso san antonio miami and new york 
besides dragnet hbos january spanish lineup includes 
empire of the sun ishtar jumpin jack flash and 
something wild cinemax is screening close encounters of the 
third kind and indiana jones and the temple of doom among 
others 
hollywood movies have been dubbed in spanish before for latin 
american and us hispanic theaters usually months after their 
englishlanguage premieres recently more movies have opened in 
both spanish and english simultaneously 
in 1988 about 50 hollywood releases such as oliver and 
company baby boom and willow were retrofitted with 
spanish sound by intersound said garry morris a spokesman for the 
dubbing studio 
about 31 percent of the hispanic homes nationally take cable 
according to miamis strategy research corporation compared to the 
53 percent of anglo households 
but that might not translate into a boon for hbo 
cable channel galavision began as a pay spanishlanguage movie 
and entertainment service but switched to nearly all news last 
september earlier airings of spanishdubbed us movies were 
unsuccessful 
we carried arthur superman ii at the same time the other 
pay services did said galavision vice president starrett berry 
we did not see a huge increase in subscribers as a result of that 
arrangement and we ultimately abandoned it 
now the channel is looking at bringing back some blocks of 
movies berry said 
more tv programs in spanish means more competition for hispanic 
viewers long used to shows produced in latin american last year 
both univision and telemundo the two spanishlanguage tv networks 
beefed up us production of programs in spanish not dubbed 
versions of englishlanguage shows 
frank cruz vice president and general manager of telemundos 
kvea in los angeles said his station had very mixed results in 
showing us films in spanish we found that our audience 
preferred to see mexican movies not the dubbed ones he said 
in new york univision president joaquin blaya mentioned 
unsuccessful efforts by mainstream broadcasters airing spanish 
simulcasts last spring cbs pulled a hispanicthemed situation 
comedy trial and error after a few weeks the show was spanish 
simulcast on radio in some cities 
if we can judge by history the efforts that have gone to 
simulcasting to the spanish community have not worked said blaya 
he said univision stations have aired spanishdubbed movies and 
they didnt work either 
nevertheless kveas cruz applauds hbos move 
hbos entry into the hispanic market is a good sign cruz 
said the more major companies that get into the spanishlanguage 
market the better it is for spanishlanguage programming across the 
board

leadership meeting at the white house today 
bush recalled a time when congress and administrations worked 
together to produce budgets on which the nation could live let us 
negotiate soon and hard he said in his inaugural address 
the people did not send us here to bicker they ask us to 
rise above the merely partisan 
but taxes and spending were part of the ammunition bush aimed at 
the democrats during the campaign that won him the white house on a 
hundred platforms he said congress would try to force him into 
imposing new taxes and hed say no read my lips no new taxes 
the targets of bushs favorite applause line arent likely to 
forget the way it was used against them theyve already said that 
bush will have to narrow the deficit gap without taxes or eat his 
campaign words and propose steps to increase revenue 
furthermore the tax question leads to the broader issues of 
spending priorities which embroiled the white house and 
congressional democrats for all eight years of ronald reagans 
presidency 
that put it at the center of political debate and as vice 
president bush was a ranking debater beginning his presidency he 
proposed another way 
a new breeze is blowing and the old bipartisanship must be 
made new again bush said in his address on friday to my 
friends and yes i do mean friends in the loyal opposition and 
yes i mean loyal i put out my hand 
bush said he was reaching out to house speaker jim wright of 
texas and to senate majority leader george j mitchell of maine 
and he turned to them on the inaugural platform to underscore the 
gesture 
this is the age of the offered hand the president said 
bipartisanship historically has been linked to foreign policy 
not to domestic issues like deficit budgets republican sen arthur 
vandenberg of michigan became a symbol of bipartisanship when he 
turned from isolationism to support president harry s truman in 
major foreign policy moves after world war ii 
vandenberg said the twoparty system was indispensable but that 
the nations voice should be united at the waters edge bush 
used that phrase in his address 
he then proposed to extend the idea to subjects that dont go 
near the water taking office before a capitol dominated by 
democrats and almost certain to stay that way throughout his 
current term he said there should be compromise instead of 
dissension harmony instead of discord 
for congress too has changed in our time said the 
president once a texas congressman there has grown a certain 
divisiveness we have seen the hard looks and heard the statements 
in which not each others ideas are challenged but each others 
motives 
our great parties have often been far apart and untrusting of 
each other 
the bitter campaign in which bush defeated massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis added to that mistrust 
reagan could afford a hard line with congress especially during 
his first term republicans had won a senate majority on his 
coattails it lasted six years and he was soaring in the polls 
house democrats could read numbers votes crucial to reagans tax 
and spending cut programs came from democrats who were worried about 
the political price of opposing him 
the bush ticket didnt show that kind of pull and the new 
president cant exert that kind of pressure his republicans lost 
three seats in the house and one in the senate in 1988 
under the circumstances newlook bipartisanship would be ideal 
for bush if he can get it hes determined to try as he put it in a 
preinauguration interview 
using lyndon johnsons words maybe different methods lets 
reason together

one recent morning a newscast on france inter radio 
carried a story about le dumping by the japanese on european 
markets the newspaper liberation had a headline saying a top 
politician was in les starting blocks for coming elections in 
the afternoon un outsider won the days top horse race 
for years the french government has been battling the creeping 
invasion of english without much success every time a new french 
word is invented such as logiciel for computer software or 
cadreur for cameraman six new englishisms pop into the language 
couch potato has yet to gain currency in france but it cant 
be far away an article in le monde about american television 
introduced the term calling such a person une patate de canape 
most french profess to hate franglais on the other hand most 
use it from morning to night in newspapers on radio and in 
conversations one is bombarded with le marketing un 
challenge le sponsor un leader or un selfmademan 
successive governments have made fighting franglais their 
official policy creating a series of organizations to counter it 
the most recent is the commissariat general de la langue 
francaise which emerged in 1984 with the job of the defense of 
the french language the agency has just published the fifth 
edition of its dictionary of official neologisms 
the 2393 neologisms new french words in the book are 
mandatory for use in all ministries official correspondence and 
documents but getting the public to accept them is another matter 
the folks at the commissariat have no enforcement power usage not 
policy determines the success or failure of a word 
it is out of the question that we play the role of policing the 
language said bernard billaud the commissariats chief 
wordmaster our role is to raise consciousness 
many feel that the adoption of foreign words enriches a language 
within limits 
all languages borrow words billaud said it goes in the 
other direction too it is not so much a problem of borrowing words 
as it is a matter of naturalization of the word borrowed and the 
spirit of the word to make it really french 
fewer than 2500 official neologisms is not a particularly 
distinguished showing for nearly 20 years of work by the 
commissariat and its predecessors but wordmaking is a long process 
we have to consult specialists find a word perhaps consult 
with the academie francaise says billaud referring that oldest 
of the guardians of the language it was created by richelieu in 
1635 billaud also acknowledges that there are serious gaps in 
the dictionary 
englishspeakers are constantly amused by the struggle 
the commissariat has decreed that un bulldozer 
booldoezair will now be a bouteur journalists no longer get 
un scoop but an exclusivite pilots no longer work in un 
cockpit but in a habitacle 
officialdom also has zapped zapping the term used here for 
tvchannel jumping it has replaced it with sautechaine which 
literally means channeljump 
it has substituted tuiteur and boumeur for tweeters and 
woofers on stereo sets but try as it might it has never been able 
to get people to use agetac the french version of the acronym 
gatt general agreement on tariffs and trade and bande video 
promotionelle just doesnt beat un clip un clip refers to 
any promotional video especially music videos 
the word factory also has failed to come up with satisfactory 
replacements for le look when referring to image le stress 
for daytoday pressure le sandwich or un bluejean 
perhaps more unusual are english words that when absorbed into 
french lose their original meaning such as le forcing which 
is to apply pressure or un gadget which can even be applied to 
a government minister or program meaning something just for show 
the real irony is when english speakers steal a french term like 
savoir faire and the french retaliate by swiping knowhow 
the same can be said of rendezvous and meeting 
worst of all are the sweatshirts and imitation american high 
school jackets where the fashion is to have english words written 
on them no matter how nonsensical such as athletic sporting 
team or babie bear club then theres the sweatshirt that 
says scoop entrainement winter which has no meaning at all and 
is a spoof on the proliferation of english words on sweatshirts 
entrainement is french for training 
why this fascination with english 
much of the usage of english is snobbism said billaud 
speaking in french but slipping into an englishism snobbisme 
which has made its way into the french dictionary 
it takes a psychoanalysis of the french people who have always 
been impressed by what comes from the outside he added it is 
evidently a phenomenon resulting from the decline of france in the 
world since 1939 france is conscious its influence has diminished 
it is trying to find compensation english plays this role 
the french want to be modern and english is a sign of 
modernity

after years of coldshouldering the united 
nations the united states now sings its praises and increasingly 
suggests things for it to do but us dollars to match the tasks 
are not forthcoming and the united states remains the biggest un 
debtor 
the united states is urging the world body to take on more 
responsibilities from monitoring the soviet withdrawal from 
afghanistan and cuban withdrawal from angola to fighting terrorism 
and drug trafficking and investigating human rights abuses and 
chemical warfare 
it also is expected to monitor the eventual vietnamese withdrawal 
from cambodia and to play a role in a middle east settlement 
but little money is forthcoming from the us congress to fund 
the burgeoning us agenda for the 159nation organization the 
united states is the largest un contributor assessed onequarter 
of the annual budget of 800 million 
while the united nations has registered a series of formidable 
peacemaking and peacekeeping successes that advance us interests 
congress has been withholding us dues 
the united states ended 1988 about 402 million in arrears in 
budget and peacekeeping dues 535 percent of the total un 
arrears of more than 750 million 
largely because of us nonpayment the united nations 
periodically faces financial crises and is having trouble paying for 
new peackeeping operations 
president bush a former us ambassador here praised the united 
nations during his election campaign and called for the payment of 
us dues 
congress has been withholding a large part of the dues because of 
budget constraints and disaffection with the world body the 
organization was seen as biased against the united states 
bureaucratically bloated and wasteful 
some money was withheld in an effort to force the united nations 
to reform itself despite administration and state department calls 
for fullfunding 
george p shultz said before leaving office as secretary of state 
said it is important for us foreign policy to fully fund our 
contributions to un agencies and to initiate a plan to pay 
arrearages over a fiveyear period 
he said the request for nearly full payment of dues is critical 
to our objectives of resolving regional conflicts the un can play 
an important role in this regard 
us undersecretary of state richard s williamson in charge of 
international organizations said up through last year the 
executive state department and white house sought full funding 
congress failed to appropriate the full amount 
in a telephone interview williamson said some people hold the 
united nations in disrepute when it does disreputable things it 
rightfully is criticized he said for overspending and for 
political moves like a general assembly resolution equating zionism 
with racism 
but he said the united nations has improved because the united 
states took a firm stand 
last year the united nations scored spectacular achievements and 
its peacekeeping forces won the nobel peace prize 
in afghanistan un observers are monitoring soviet withdrawal 
under a unmediated agreement for years ending soviet 
involvement in afghanistan was a prime us foreign policy goal 
in the persian gulf un peacekeepers are monitoring a 
ceasefire while iran and iraq are talking under un auspices the 
ceasefire enabled the united states to scale back its costly naval 
presence there 
in southern africa the united nations is helping to fulfill 
another us goal getting sovietbacked cuban troops out of angola 
un observers will monitor the cuban pullout and peacekeepers will 
oversee namibias transition to independence from south africa under 
a un plan 
in the western sahara conflict a un peace plan has been 
accepted by morocco antimoroccan guerrillas and algeria and the 
world body will supervise free elections there in cyprus un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar has sponsored talks 
between greek and turkish cypriot communities to discuss 
reunification of the mediterranean island 
in his final budget president ronald reagan requested nearly 
full un funding in the 1990 fiscal year 2055 million for the 
regular budget plus an additional 46 million to begin paying off 
us arrears the arrears of 403 million include 3077 million for 
the budget and 941 million for peacekeeping 
the soviet union has been paying its arrears and now owes 9 
million to the regular budget and 172 million to peacekeeping 
for almost eight years the reagan administration and the world 
body were estranged the united states charged it was ineffectual 
prosoviet antiamerican and wasteful but in his farewell address 
to the general assembly in september reagan praised the world body 
for helping to end regional conflicts

one holy man walked naked among his 
disciples offering sacred ash blessings and cardamoms as 
consecrated host not far away another holy man delivered a sermon 
while dressed in a saffron robe 
why move naked the second said you can reach god 
dressed 
a third who pitched his tent nearby told his group dress 
does not matter ways do not matter be pure be good and you 
will reach heaven you need no guru 
they were hindu holy men at the hinduisms biggest congregation 
the kumbh mela which began here recently in allahabad 
the three holy men each with different views were examples of 
the diversity of a religion believed to have been practiced since 
the third millennium bc 
they also showed that hinduism with 330 million gods and 
goddesses can be confusing even to hindus 
the religion claims a following of 730 million people in india 
and nepal and parts of bangladesh indonesia thailand in southeast 
asia mauritius in africa and fiji in the south pacific for 
comparison the roman catholic church claims a following of 850 
million 
an estimated 500000 holy men and their followers started camping 
at allahabad on jan 14 for a sevenweek congregation or fair 
during which 30 million to 40 million pilgrims were expected to take 
dips at the sangam the confluence of the three rivers most 
sacred to hindus the ganges the jamuna and the saraswathi 
the sangam which takes its name from a mythical fight 
between gods and demons over a pot of nectar is held every 12 years 
when jupiter enters taurus and the sun and the moon are in capricorn 
you cant explain hinduism said mp asthana who has 
attended four earlier fairs it is a way of life where karmas 
the results of deeds are most important even to an average hindu 
the faith is so confusing 
he added no one can explain how we got to acquire and where 
are our 330 million gods and goddesses 
believers worship images and statues of gods and goddesses as 
well as live animals including rats in hinduism every god has his 
steed or vehicle and the rat is the vehicle of ganesha on whom the 
elephantheaded masterofceremony god rides 
hinduism postulates that everyone goes through a series of 
rebirths or reincarnations that eventually lead to moksha the 
spiritual salvation that frees one from the cycle of rebirths 
with each rebirth you can move closer to or further from 
eventual moksha said asthana who is the spokesman for the state 
government of uttar pradesh in which allahabad is a major city 
the deciding factor is ones karma bad actions result in bad 
karma which leads one to lower incarnation and a step further from 
salvation 
but if ones actions have been good he or she will reincarnate 
on a higher level and be a step closer to eventual freedom from 
rebirth 
coming to allahabad has special significance for hindus and tens 
of thousands come daily to take holy dips at the sangam believing 
doing this during the auspicious planetary conjugation will wash 
away all the sins of a lifetime and release them from the cycle of 
births and rebirths 
it is like appearing directly before god for confessions 
said jagannath dwevedi the chief adminstrator of the fair 
no one knows how bathing will wash off sins but the belief is 
so great that no logic stands 
before taking the dip pilgrims offer milk and marigolds to the 
rivers in a purification ritual and later throw water with their 
hands toward the sky believing that some drops will reach their 
ancestors in the heaven 
now this sounds like a total nonsense but people do it 
said the 56yearold dwevedi it is the ageold belief it is 
above logic 
nagas are the naked recluses of hinduism and they have their own 
logic 
nakedness ends all dichotomy in human life said one 
refusing to give his name we were born naked and therefore should 
remain naked and die naked 
fiftytwo different religious groups put up sprawling tent homes 
at the fair each has its own way to reach god most of them 
constantly smoke marijuana they say it helps them meditate and 
become closer to god 
this makes hinduism unique said asthana there is no 
restriction on how you reach your goal salvation 
only vegetables appear on the fairs menus because devout hindus 
are vegetarians and eating beef is taboo hindus worship the cow

with money pouring from a booming export 
business a lust for gambling has taken hold and turned this 
nationalist chinese island into a massive underground casino 
officials say it threatens to disrupt the economy 
the gambling craze is attributed to the flood of idle cash 
created by taiwans economic success and of limited investment 
opportunities 
its worse than a huge casino said a dismayed jaw shaokang 
a legislator of the governing nationalist party we dont even 
have fair gambling rules and decent bookies 
gambling is illegal in taiwan but an estimated 2 million people 
or roughly onetenth the population play an underground game based 
on results of a twiceweekly lottery in nearby hong kong 
they are lured by the chance to win 10 to 500 times their bets 
which typically are 500 taiwan dollars 18 or more only a tiny 
fraction of players about 6000 people were arrested or fined last 
year 
the game became a favorite with farmers factory workers and 
market vendors after the government suspended its own lottery in 
1987 to break up underground gambling based on the drawing 
on tuesdays and thursdays when the hong kong lottery is held 
taiwans telephone lines are jammed by people calling bookies for 
results 
gamblers pray to folk gods for winning numbers and often 
celebrate at buddhist temples when they win 
the lottery gamblers have gone too far fumed ching 
meihsien principal of taipeis fu shing primary school which is 
near such a temple their noisy celebrations often disrupt our 
students in class 
taiwans two largest cities taipei and kaohsiung recently 
proposed running their own lotteries to raise funds for social 
welfare programs cabinet approval is needed for the drawings to 
begin later this year 
meanwhile tens of thousands of taiwanese have turned to gambling 
on futures prices on commodity markets in chicago and new york 
an estimated 500 local companies including jewelry shops and 
investment firms accept daily bets totaling about 5 billion taiwan 
dollars 179 million based on the movement of futures prices on 
the overseas markets according to martin tsai a financial 
consultant with the alliance international law office which advises 
businesses and government agencies 
newspapers estimate each company has about 160 clients meaning 
about 80000 people gamble on commodity prices 
even the local stock exchange is widely viewed as little more 
than a legal form of gambling many inexperienced players such as 
housewives office clerks retired servicemen and college students 
view the market solely as a way to make quick money through 
speculation 
the exchange reported in january that about 166 million people 
have opened accounts with stock brokers trading volume totaled the 
taiwan dollar equivalent of about 280 billion last year the third 
largest in the world after new york and tokyo 
on average each of the total 34 billion shares changed hands 
nearly three times last year even though roughly twothirds of the 
shares were closely held and not for sale 
frederick chien chairman of the staterun council for economic 
planning and development believes the gambling craze has changed 
traditional values that helped taiwan improve its economy 
dramatically with per capita annual income in 1988 of 157400 
taiwan dollars 5512 a 56 percent increase from 1983 
so many people are obsessed with speculation chien said 
they want to become rich overnight and they no longer work so 
hard for the money 
in a recent speech economics minister chen lian said the trend 
could eventually erode taiwans economic achievement he complained 
that businesmen increasingly prefer the pursuit of quick profit 
through gambling and speculation over productive investment 
liu shouhsiang an economics professor at chinese culture 
university in taipei said the lack of channels for investment is a 
major reason behind the upswing in gambling most bonds are 
purchased by banks real estate is too expensive and only a few 
mutual funds are allowed 
the government has taken some steps to help open up new 
investment opportunities in recent years easing foreign exchange 
controls to stimulate overseas investment 
some taiwanese still fear overseas investments as an unknown 
risk however and have been reluctant to diversify

the trial of former military strongman luis 
garcia meza and more than 50 collaborators on murder and corruption 
charges has been under way for three years and still has a long way 
to go 
but court officials say they are in no hurry because the trial 
itself sends a clear warning signal to others who might plot coups 
this trial sets a precedent for future rulers and puts the 
brakes on criminal acts by bad governments supreme court judge 
julio urquizu gutierrez said in an interview with the associated 
press 
the trial comes at a time when the democratic system is 
strengthening it is thanks to the democracy we are experiencing 
that this trial is taking place 
human rights activists say the case also could bolster the 
flagging democratic spirits of other south american countries where 
new civilian governments are suffering from declining popularity 
largely because of economic difficulties 
we see that democracies in this part of latin america are 
weakening as is the case in peru argentina and even brazil said 
ivan paz claros secretary general of bolivias human rights 
assembly for this trial to result in a conviction will help 
stengthen the democratic process in bolivia and neighboring 
countries 
the human rights assembly is party to the trial ordered by 
congress in 1984 and begun in february 1986 court officials 
estimate it could continue for two or three years more 
charges against garcia meza a former rightwing president and 
his collaborators include crimes against the constitution sedition 
murder genocide and fraud three defendants have died since the 
trial began and 54 people in all now are on trial including six 
fugitives being tried in absentia 
the fugitives who have been stripped of their citizenship and 
property include the former interior minister luis arce gomez who 
also is wanted in miami fla on cocaine trafficking charges 
garcia meza 57 seized power july 17 1980 in a military coup 
that toppled the civilian government of president lydia gueiler 
tejada the takeover the fourth in two years received substantial 
backing from the rightwing military junta that then ruled argentina 
and from cocaine traffickers according to human rights officials 
scores of political labor and church leaders and journalists 
were arrested after his coup many were tortured and expelled and 
some were killed 
garcia meza vowed to stay in power 20 years but his harsh rule 
quickly became unpopular and reports of high government involvement 
in drug smuggling spread after 13 months he was forced out by the 
military joint chiefs of staff which named another military officer 
as president 
popular pressure for a return to civilian rule prompted the 
military to call elections in 1982 they were won by hernan siles 
zuazo a civilian who was succeeded three years later by the current 
president victor paz estenssoro new elections are planned for may 
since the trial began garcia meza has been at least officially 
confined to the city of sucre known for its colonial churches and 
plazas 260 miles east of la paz the capital 
he has become the talk of the town 
despite his past he enjoys the support of many citizens has 
been named godfather at many local baptisms and is invited to 
weddings residents say 
the people in sucre have received us well something we did not 
expect his wife olma said we have no problems and like 
living here so we may stay here after the trial garcia meza 
himself refused to be interviewed 
mrs garcia meza said her husband was neither a killer nor 
powerhungry 
my husband was not aware or responsible for everything that 
happened during the coup he was named president at the request of 
the armed forces she added 
garcia meza spends much of his time at a ranch called duraznillo 
an hours drive from sucre where he trains and sells horses his 
wife said 
one of garcia mezas four lawyers daniel salamanca trujillo 
said merchants wont take money from the expresident when he gets a 
haircut or has his clothes drycleaned

colleges have tried many tactics to 
attract capable minority students and make them feel welcome 
offered special scholarships started support groups hired 
counselors overlooked low test scores 
at gettysburg college theyre about to try genealogy 
starting in march this lutheranaffiliated liberal arts school 
where just 40 of 1850 students are black is opening an 
intercultural resource center where all students but especially 
africanamericans can learn how to research their family roots 
the twostory woodframe center when it is officially dedicated 
at a march 18 ceremony will coordinate a campuswide effort to help 
minority students develop selfawareness and confidence 
the ultimate aim to break down the sense of isolation blacks 
often feel on this campus help them be part of the mainstream and 
eventually use their selfawareness to strive for leadership roles 
already the centers bookshelves are packed with state census 
records from 40 states dating back to the early 1800s thick brown 
volumes contain ship passenger and immigration lists dating back to 
the 18th century there are also genealogy guides for germans 
i 
the new gettysburg center is unusual on several counts probably 
no other school so small has focused such attention on 
africanamerican genealogy according to james dent walker a 
founder of the washingtonbased afroamerican historical and 
genealogical society the much larger temple university in 
philadelphia houses the charles l blockson afroamerican collection 
which contains over 40000 items 
second gettysburg pointedly chose not to name it an 
afroamerican center or black student center as many 
colleges have the idea was to have a place on campus celebrating 
all cultures 
finally gettysburg may be the first college to view genealogy as 
a vehicle for recruiting and retaining minority students 
that strategy may lack the glitz or quickfix appeal of setting 
numerical minority recruitment goals or quotas as other colleges 
have but gettysburg never did 
but matthews says he has already used his approach successfully 
as a minority counselor at two other predominantly white campuses 
northern michigan university and the affiliated hobart and william 
smith colleges in geneva ny 
now he confidently predicts gettysburg will end up with a name 
across the united states as a place for the advancement of 
africanamerican and other minority students 
yet gettysburg seems hardly the most fertile place for an 
innovative approach to black student recruitment despite its 
location adjacent to the civil war battlefield where abraham lincoln 
delivered his address that became an anthem in the history of race 
relations 
college guides such as the yale insiders guide have 
described gettysburgs students as all alike and white and 
upper middleclass 
the descriptions are all too true admits president charles 
glassick 
black students here say that while seldom the target of overt 
racism they often feel shunned and isolated 
most students here never interacted with blacks and at 
gettysburg its possible to avoid that said michael warren a 
22yearold senior majoring in africanamerican studies 
we were frankly interested in enrolling more minority students 
so we brought in harry matthews said glassick 
well under 100 blacks were applying to gettysburg each year and 
the retention rate of those who attend had been abominable said 
glassick the rate was 46 percent in the 1970s though that has 
recently improved to around 73 percent 
even with warm backing by the president and trustees matthews 
arrival at gettysburg in 1985 was not greeted with universal joy 
did i feel welcome hell no it was a challenge he told a 
visitor 
some in the faculty and administration were looking for a more 
radical guy he said some called the conservativelydressed 
softspoken matthews an uncle tom others wondered aloud why 
matthews and his ideas were worth scarce college dollars when they 
seemed geared to so few students 
but when the college spent 450000 to purchase the building that 
eventually housed the center it became clear to all that the 
center and matthews were here to stay 
matthews says he faced the same jolting transition that other 
black college students often find so trying he grew up in 
roosevelt long island a new york suburb where the public schools 
are mostly black he wanted to attend historically black fisk 
university but wound up at the mostly white state university of new 
york at oneonta where financial aid was more generous 
in 1977 the popularity of roots the book and television 
miniseries by alex haley sparked matthews passion for genealogy 
when roots came out i made a pledge to trace my family before 
i had children he said a vow he has kept 
eleven years of subsequent research led him to discover ancestors 
dating back to the american revolution he believes his oldest 
ancestor was a freedman known as isaac the african who served in the 
3rd regiment of south carolina 
the resource center will only be the starting point for such 
research however students wanting to delve deeply into their past 
will still have to go to the national archives in washington talk 
to relatives check state and county records of births retirement 
records marriage certificates and property deeds just as any 
genealogist would eventually matthews hopes the center will 
sponsor trips to archives in washington and elsewhere 
genealogy is especially formidable for blacks census data are 
only helpful back to 1870 its almost impossible for most blacks to 
discover their ancestral kunta kinte the character in roots 
captured in africa and brought to america on a slave ship 
what may be possible though difficult is to trace lineage 
before 1870 by studying white slaveholding families 
with black genealogy said matthews you just cant get around 
white folks its the only way

her maryland home 
not to worry said hennin coowner of the maine shelter

passive solar heat and a jacuzzi and all for 55000 about 
onethird market value 
they not only give you the information they give you the 
confidence cowfer said you dont need building experience 
for 15 years hennin his wife patsy and several other

of building a home at less than half the cost of buying the 
finished home or hiring someone to build it 
people who build their own homes are more satisfied hennin said 
less hurried than a contractor the doityourselfer will examine 
every aspect of the building process and make carefully considered 
decisions 
contractors dont shop around and generally do not match 
solutions to specific problems he said the contractor simply 
does it this way because thats the way theyve always done it 
more than 14000 students from around the world including 
novices who barely knew which end of the hammer to hold have 
attended the school located in a 120yearold brick building in this 
coastal town north of portland the students range in age from 18 to 
70 and have included lumberjacks doctors madison avenue 
executives carpenters engineers and architects 
students can choose the 15week onedayaweek session for 450 
per person or 725 per couple or opt for compressed sessions of two 
or three weeks for slightly more money classes are limited to 40 
students 
all students learn how to survey a lot pour a foundation design 
and build every inch of a house they also receive instruction in 
the concept of heat the physics of materials engineering framing 
and financing 
the information was presented in such a way that it was 
nonintimidating said gary miers 34 who is spending 50000 to 
build a house valued at 140000 in raymond it was presented in a 
relaxed fashion 
mistakes arent ruinous hennin said because there isnt 
anything in a house that isnt forgiving 
thats comforting for students who also quickly learn that the 
mistakes they make are much less costly than if a contractor were 
building the house 
when a contractor walks into a store he doesnt ask what the 
price is he just assumes hes getting the wholesale cost but the 
price may be lower elsewhere hennin said contractors dont shop 
around 
for example a shelter institute student can make insulated glass 
windows for about 3 per square foot whereas a contractor is likely 
to pay 10 hennin said all the lumber to build a house rarely 
would be over 4000 he added 
the hennins both 45 began their business in 1974 hennin who 
had just finished law school and had some prior building experience 
was hired to help build a house for a friend soon he had other 
offers to build and his wifes interest in home construction 
surfaced 
we had a choice of building houses for the rest of our lives or 
getting involved in another way teaching people mrs hennin 
said 
housing styles have changed over the last 15 years after the 
simple boxstyle homes that marked the days of energy conservation 
and the backtotheearth movement of the early and mid1970s 
underground homes became popular those now have been replaced by 
elaborate designs more reflective of the 1980s prosperity 
sophistication and selfindulgence mrs hennin said 
jim and roxie westbrook of santa cruz calif are building a 
passivesolar country house on the outskirts of the nearby henry 
cowell redwoods state park complete with a hot tub and more gadgets 
and fixtures than they had in the older homes they owned 
theres nothing cheap in it mrs westbrook said in a 
telephone interview when its a choice between quality and going 
for quality we go for quality 
others prefer a home that is unadorned miers and his wife left 
pennsylvania with the romantic notion of building a home that 
embraced their 1960s values the desire to be independent 
energyefficient and frugal 
but despite changing tastes mrs hennin says most people are 
joined by a creative urge and a determination to take control of 
their lives 
its a grabbing of life rather than letting life roll you 
over she said if houses cost so much its your responsibility 
to figure out a way for them not to cost so much

editors note irans islamic revolution will be 10 years old on 
feb 11 the day ayatollah khomeinis followers seized power in 
tehran the revolution enters its second decade with a limping 
economy and after sobering setbacks an ap correspondent who covered 
the revolution reports on what may lie ahead

irans islamic revolution has survived 10 
turbulent years against all the odds bloody internal strife a 
crippling eightyear war with iraq and the hostility of much of the 
world 
on feb11 1979 nine days after ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
nemisis of the shah of shahs returned to tehran in triumph from 15 
years of exile his bearded revolutionaries seized the reins of 
government when the last monarchist government collapsed 
shah mohammad reza pahlavi had already gone into exile jan 16 
his 40year reign on the peacock throne imploding in anarchy his 
imperial regime notorious for corruption and torture khomeinis 
years in power have by many accounts been a mirror image 
nonethless many of irans 50 million people will take to the 
streets this week to mark the anniversary of the islamic revolution 
as the country stumbles at last out of a decade behind the dark 
islamic veil of selfimposed isolation 
but beneath that mood of celebration the country faces a future 
of political uncertainty exhaustion from the conflict with its 
ancient arab enemy deep economic malaise and debate about which 
path the revolution must now take 
there are some indications of the direction the revolution is 
moving under parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani the countrys 
leading pragmatist and for the time being at least the most 
powerful figure after khomeini 
acknowledging that revolutionary zealotry unnecessarily estranged 
iran from the rest of the world he is the driving force behind 
moves to the isolation that began with the november 1979 seizure of 
the us embassy and deepened with tehrans support for antiwestern 
shiite terrorism and hostagetaking in lebanon 
he also acknowledged in october that the revolution the war 
notwithstanding has also failed to improve conditions for the 
mostathafin or the dispossessed in whose name the revolution 
was waged 
we still have not been able to clarify for people economic 
benefits as befits islam as we have differences of opinion among 
ourselves over these issues he said we have not yet tackled 
the daytoday aspects of islamic rule 
above all iranians are increasingly obsessed with how much 
longer khomeini will live and what will happen when he dies 
the sternfaced shiite moslem spiritual leader father of the 
revolution and its undisputed authority is 88 years old and 
reported in poor health rarely venturing from his heavily guarded 
residence in the jamaran suburb of north tehran where the shahs 
elite once lived 
when he dies iran faces a power struggle between its leaders 
that some iranians fear could even start a civil war 
most political analysts believe that the revolution will survive 
that expected turmoil but that its ideological makeup will likely 
undergo considerable change depending on which faction comes out on 
top 
for the time being rafsanjani and his allies who include 
president ali khamenei foreign minister ali akbar velayati and 
khomeinis son ahmed who controls access to his ailing father in 
his north tehran stronghold appear to have the upper hand 
but they face stiff challenges in the days ahead from hardliners 
such as interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi prime minister 
hussein musavi and others who fear his policies are eroding the 
revolutions islamic purity 
the revolution has endured and its there to stay said 
hansheino kopietz a seasoned analyst of iranian affairs with the 
londonbased international institute for strategic studies 
but revolutions do not remain rigid for very long because there 
are too many internal pressures he said in a telephone interview 
a civil war after khomeini dies is a possibility the power 
center in tehran will probably be strong enough to prevent irans 
polarizing but the revolution will have to redefine itself if it is 
to survive 
philip robbins an analyst with londons royal institute for 
international affairs said outsiders have focused largely on the 
negative aspects of the last 10 years in iran its failure in the 
war and in the economy two of its flagship policies but the 
revolution has done more than just get rid of the shah iran is now 
very much its own boss it has asserted its independence very 
forcefully 
whether or not you like the regime its selfconfidence and 
survival have to be recognized 
the war with iraq in which by some western estimates 1 million 
iranians were killed and tens of thousands maimed was a unifying 
force that muted the bickering in the hierarchy and maintained 
revolutionary momentum

the end of the war last august when khomeini reluctantly 
accepted a united nationssponsored ceasefire after a chain of 
battlefield defeats removed that veneer exposing and intensifying 
the bitter infighting between rivals for power in the postkhomeini 
era 
irans 83member council of experts formed in 1983 to designate 
a successor to khomeini selected grand ayatollah husseinali 
montazeri two years later 
khomeini apparently went along with that choice but many iranian 
leaders opposed it khomeini last year made out a new political 
testament to be opened after his death in which he reportedly 
indicated that he now prefers that a triumvirate of senior figures 
run iran after his demise 
since the ceasefire there have been persistent reports that 
hundreds possibly thousands of dissidents have been executed 
including supporters of montazeri in an apparent effort to 
eliminate opposition in the aftermath of irans sudden collapse in 
the war 
khomeinis grudging acceptance of a ceasefire at rafsanjanis 
urging embittered many hardliners even if it came as a relief to 
many other iranians 
rafsanjani who is also acting commanderinchief and montazeris 
main rival is considered to be behind the current crackdown 
it is thought to be the most severe since the regime 
systematically wiped out its leftist and liberal allies in 1981 when 
tens of thousands of people were believed to have been killed 
yet it has come handinhand with a general move to liberalize 
irans repressive political structure several iranian leaders have 
called for greater freedom of expression and a greater role for the 
longsuppressed private sector in the economy 
the government has passed a law allowing the formation of 
political parties provided they dont conspire against the regime 
even hardline radicals such as mohtashemi an increasingly 
powerful figure and intelligence minister mohammad reyshahri have 
joined this chorus 
many see this sudden outbreak of tolerance particularly among 
the radicals to be little more than an effort by the various 
factions to consolidate their power bases for the battle for the 
succession they all see coming 
there is no external threat to the regime despite the noises 
made by opposition groups in exile but after the war its not 
surprising that the regime would direct peoples thought toward an 
internal threat robbins noted 
despite bitter opposition rafsanjanis policy of building 
bridges to the west and irans suspicious arab neighbors in the gulf 
is seen as a triumph of pragmatism over revolutionary fanaticism 
rafsanjani stressed in a keynote statement recently that 
revolutionary fervor had led iran to make many mistakes in the 
early days of the revolution 
we have learned not to create unnecessary obstructions he 
said we should not embark on making enemies for ourselves 
in a speech soon after rafsanjani echoed other leaders by 
calling on some of the hundreds of thousands of educated iranians 
who are among the 2 million who have fled since 1979 to return home 
to help in postwar reconstruction 
if we improve conditions if we give up some of the 
shortsightedness some of the excesses and some of the crude 
aspects which were the requirements of the early stages of the 
revolution and that we have no need of nowadays we will be able to 
attract them back to the country he said 
montazeri who has long advocated greater freedom of expression 
possibly so his voice could be heard in media largely controlled by 
rafsanjani noted in a speech to islamic students if we do not 
tolerate listening to views opposed to ours those opposition 
remarks will soon be turned into bullets 
for most iranian leaders this is a remarkable turnaround from 
the inflammatory exhortations to the worlds 800 million moslems to 
rise up in the name of a resurgent islam as well as tehrans 
longmaintained drive to export its revolution 
theyve had to compromise their islamic revolutionary 
principles to get international economic help to rebuild the 
country robbins said its a sign of political maturity 
postwar irans first major political test will come in august 
when the fourth presidential election will be held khamenei who 
has served two terms cannot run for a third under the constitution 
rafsanjani whose political cunning has earned him the nickname 
of the shark is understood to be pressing for constitutional 
reforms to give the presidency greater executive power and install 
one of his allies 
the presidency is just one of several competing power centers in 
tehran a situation that has complicated the contradictory trends 
within the hierarchy 
analysts agree that until the power struggle is settled and a 
coherent leadership emerges iran faces further convulsions

editors note the infection proved curable at a hefty cost no 
sensitive secrets were penetrated but the anguish a nowfamous 
computer virus produced last november has led to soulsearching 
about computer security the fact is that the machines are 
vulnerable to all sorts of interference from playful hackers to 
sophisticated criminals second of three articles

the bad news is that computers get 
diseases 
the worse news is that when they do the illness can spread at 
the speed of light leaving everything from household accounts to 
business data to power plants to defense systems fatally stricken 
apocalypse now its not just a movie 
theres a potential risk that matches the destructiveness of a 
nuclear attack warns donn parker an authority on computer crime 
at sri international here 
in only a few short years computers have become the bedrock of 
how the united states and increasingly the developed world 
operate computers handle half a trillion dollars in us bank 
transfers a day they guide planes through the air and back to land 
they monitor hospital patients predict weather run phone systems 
plant crops and check the results out of supermarkets store any 
data imaginable your bank balance the national debt when a 
computer gets sniffles a whole system can catch pneumonia 
computer technology advances almost daily so do the techniques 
of computer security so do the threats of someone witting or 
unwitting monkeywrenching whole systems 
computers get sick for the same reasons humans catch flu or vd 
they interconnect the illnesses bear the same familiar names that 
attack people worms bugs viruses they work the same way 
invading a system and replicating or infiltrating until the body is 
overwhelmed 
a worm broadly believed to have been planted last november by 
cornell grad student robert morris within hours fouled up some 6000 
interconnected computers in a defenseuniversity network estimates 
of the damage done and the manhours spent to repair it run from 20 
to 95 million 
the origins of computer disease vary begin with the hacker the 
computer junkie who spends every waking minute bopping around in 
computerland exploring its fascinations then come the mischievous 
then the malicious and then the outright criminal the embezzler 
the corporate spy what donn parker fears is the arrival 
eventually of the terrorist 
some case histories of computer illness benign and less so 
in 1986 then israeli foreign minister yitzhak shamir was about to 
give a speech which said 
let us say yes to a great massive successful and victorious 
herut movement 
just before delivery it was discovered an otherwiseminded 
employee had wormed his way into shamirs computer and changed the

let us say yes to a tiny worrying and incompetent herut 
movement 
in fort worth texas an uneasy employee planted a time bomb 
in his company computer any time his name did not appear 
indicating hed been fired the hidden instruction would activate 
destroying the firms files 
about five years ago in new york students at the exclusive 
dalton school found their way into the computers at the 
sloankettering institute for cancer research they were discovered 
before they could do any damage intended or inadvertent to medical 
files 
in hayward calif a rapist used a computer to get the addresses 
of women he attacked by tracing their license plates through state 
files to which he had access in the equity funding scandal of the 
70s a ring used computers to steal some 70 million 
besides the federal government 48 states have laws against 
computer crime the remaining two vermont and west virginia are 
considering introducing legislation this year 
in effect the laws say thou shalt not steal thou shalt not do 
damage and thou shalt not trespass said jay bloombecker who runs 
the national institute for computer crime data in los angeles he 
estimates computer crime may have reached the billionsayear level 
in the united states the problem is getting society to treat 
computer crime as it does other crimes 
computers are a natural for disease and crime because they are 
vulnerable they are vulnerable because their usefulness is 
magnified many times over when they talk to each other to exchange 
news or data or memory unfortunately that means they can share 
infection 
a network is for exchange of information says richard 
koenig associate director of the computer security institute in 
northborough mass if it needs a lot of security you defeat its 
purpose 
any communication designed for easy access is subject to 
tampering says bill cunningham head of management information 
systems for the associated press 
to stop tampering or worse koenig foresees the day when access 
to computer networks will be encoded like a scrambler phone but 
that only makes computers even more intimidating to the unpracticed 
layman than they already are its a dilemma 
to the hacker its more likely a challenge the more complex a 
system gets the more nooks and crannies for hackers to try and get 
into says tom mandel a computer futurist at sri this is not to 
point a finger at hackers quite the contrary their contribution to 
technology is inestimable they push machines beyond their designed 
limits to new horizons their genius with software is one reason the 
united states leads the world in that technology

hackers resent guilt by association with computer viruses they 
call people who spread them or commit evil computer deeds 
crackers they think crackers deserve jail as an example 
most computer crimes are done not by hackers but by company 
insiders according to bloombeckers last survey in 1986 and they 
were far less sophisticated than hackers he notes 
nonetheless there may be as many as 8 million personal computers 
in the united states worldwide sales of pcs in 1986 were 509 
billion so a lot of people have new toys 
technology draws people to play with it says don ingraham 
an assistant prosecutor in alameda county calif who specializes 
in computer crime and a lot of kid hackers gum up the works 
because they dont know any better mandel says 
morris a hacker whose father was at bell labs and is now a 
computer security expert with the national security agency may have 
had only an elegant prank in mind but he made a mistake with his 
worm and it ate up disks 
hackers who sign off on computer bulletin boards as crimson 
death phantom phreaker nightstalker add a darker dimension dave 
flory who heads the fraud unit for the san jose police cites 
studies and experience that indicate that 2 percent of the 
population are sociopathic and 1 percent of them criminally so they 
tend to be brighter than average and younger males as are those 
intrigued by computers flory leaves the inference standing 
but when does hacking become cracking 
a hacker has been breaking into florys police bulletin board and 
says he wont leave unless the cops pay his phone bills to play 
longdistance computer games 
thats extortion says flory san jose cops caught two 
teenagers in a phone booth trying to hook up a laptop to a phone 
they were in it for the sexual thrill of knowing secrets 
says flory but its also attempted theft from the phone company 
theyll probably get three months at the most 
generally the punishment does not fit the crime donn parker 
believes 
there are a great many gray areas when a 15yearold cupertino 
boy got into the stanford university computer to change grades 
stanford stored for high schools as a community service whats 
that a prank illegal entry 
what is it when somebody has invaded your computer so that a nude 
woman begins appearing as youre doing your income tax leaving you 
with the message you should be doing something better than 
looking at this trash or the cookie monster that stopped your 
computer until you wrote out cookie to its request i want 
a cookie are these viruses jokes invasions of privacy 
hackers know where the line is says jef poskanzer a 
30yearold berkeley hacker and software programmer 
maybe says flory but a guy who wouldnt come at you with 
a knife may harm you with a computer because its impersonal he 
wont see blood 
someone could pirate your technology and its not valuable to 
you for eight years until the research pays off how do you quantify 
the loss asks koenig what is the value of intellectual 
property were still struggling with this 
if a hacker in ithaca ny does damage to computer data in 
california has he violated california criminal laws against 
unauthorized access its like a guy upstream dumping pollutants 
in a creek says ingraham the guy downstream who waters his 
stock in the creek has a case but our national laws are 
inadequate 
computer technology moves so fast the laws lag behind its like 
the early days of the old west cattlemen moved in and grazed their 
herds on open range just as hackers used to browse unhindered in 
computerland then the sheepmen arrived and put up fences range 
wars resulted until the law could set guidelines 
we dont teach breaking and entering in architectural school 
dont teach aspects of cracking in grade school says ingraham 
its the same thing 
parker believes schoolchildren should be taught computer ethics 
just as they are taught computer use 
we teach driver education because there is an obligation to 
tell kids what the law is before we send them out on the road 
for the criminal to whom ethics are immaterial the computer has 
been a bonanza today you can commit a crime in berkeley from oslo 
if you wanted ingraham says jesse and frank james had to have 
horses and colt 45s and a bag for the swag to rob a bank today you 
dont even have to be present at the bank the loots on tape 
the technology has exploded to the point parker says where the 
thief is confronted with a new problem how much to take the 
smart criminal steals below the pain threshold of the victim to 
avoid embarrassment the company may just say take your money and 
go but the thief still has to take enough to get to rio or hire a 
good lawyer if he doesnt make it 
computers save prostitutes the cost of a pimp they book 
customers via bulletin boards ingraham rarely sees a drug bust 
where the dealers dont keep track of business on computers 
the only secure computer is one still in the box it came in or 
one that never talks to another any further security is manmade 
and therefore fallible

editors note forget the sleazy massage parlor professional 
massage therapists are being invited into the workplace often at 
company expense to help relieve stress and tension in the past 
five years the number of certified massage therapists has increased 
fivefold as more and more americans learn how to get rubbed the 
right way 
</TEXT>

after hours hunched over a steering wheel 
breathing bus fumes and fighting traffic chauffeur michael 
manganaro needs to be kneaded 
for him its a company perk the kind of service offered state 
department bureaucrats professional hockey players and a growing 
number of other americans 
manganaro and about 200 other employees of hj heinz co can 
kick off their shoes and sink into a padded chair for a 15minute 
rubdown once a week in a quiet conference room at the companys 
downtown headquarters 
driving in the city really can tense you up manganaro 41 
says as he gets out of the chair this really relaxes you it 
really makes you feel good 
the rubdowns are offered as part of a new stressreduction 
program in which the company pays half of the 1250 fee for 15 
minutes its one example of how massage is going mainstream in the 
united states 
thousands of americans are getting rubbed the right way at work 
health clubs hotels malls airports street fairs and at home 
massage is no longer perceived as illicit or a toy for the idle 
rich its for everybody says gene arbetter spokesman for the 
american massage therapy association its for the average worker 
its for the weekend athlete not just an olympian 
the massage association estimates about 10 percent of americans 
have tried professional massage at least once those kneaded 
regularly often work in highpressure jobs that put kinks in their 
shoulders and backs 
the body has a good selfregulating mechanism but we 
20thcentury man throw an awful lot of obstacles into that 
balance arbetter says cradling the phone between the ear and 
the shoulder sitting in poor chairs carrying a purse or gym bag on 
only one shoulder falling asleep in front of the television can do 
things to the circulation and the muscle structure that are just not 
kind 
founded in 1943 the associations membership has jumped 500 
percent to about 7500 members in the past five years most states 
dont license massage therapists so the association has developed a 
program of certification that requires members to spend at least six 
months at an approved school including 500 hours of classroom time 
arbetter said 
the cost of a massage varies from 20 to 80 per hour depending 
on the location and the therapists training he says 
massage doesnt cure or treat but what it does try to do is 
get some type of balance in the body by loosening tight muscles and 
allowing tensions on the opposite sides of the body to be more 
equal arbetter says 
sabina vidunas gives the massages at heinz like most of todays 
practitioners she has distanced herself from the image of the 
sleazy massage parlor and refers to herself as a massage therapist 
not a masseuse she studied massage for a year at the swedish 
institute in new york city after working as a registered nurse for 
five years 
the heinz employees remain clothed as ms vidunas kneads the 
upper body including scalp and hands in a sort of minimassage 
that uses no oil 
everyone is affected by a busier lifestyle ms vidunas says 
its just taking 15 minutes out of your day to totally relax 
priscilla grden a secretary at the companys heinz usa division 
has scheduled at least one massage a month with ms vidunas since 
april 
its just a great great feeling she says it just takes 
away all your tension 
massage is making headway in other corporate quarters therapist 
jan robbins says she takes it to the people with her company 
corporate stressbusters a sort of massage delivery service in san 
franciscos financial district a hotbed of stress 
when tense urban professionals beckon robbins shows up at their 
office with the equipment a stool a cushion and a pair of hands 
you just whip out the chair and people sit down close the 
phones hit the lights close the doors and get 15 minutes of peace 
and quiet ms robbins says 
robbins says most of her clients work for small companies but 
some large corporations have shown interest in her service because 
of the growing cost of stressinduced illness 
people are suffering from everything from headaches to heart 
disease and the traditional ways of dealing with these problems 
arent working ms robbins says the claims for mental and 
emotional stress are skyrocketing 
even in the offices of the state department in washington dc 
massage is a hit employees pay for the services of bahaa karra 
whose company washington health systems comes to the office 
basement twice a week to offer massages ranging from 15 minutes for 
11 to an hour for 44 
im booked full for two or three weeks in advance karra 
says it is not easy to get an hour massage in the state 
department 
nancy gelman says she gives 15minute massages in her portable 
chair at jeffreys hair salon in pittsburgh often to clients 
between their manicure and their hair 
carol cadman a massage therapist for 12 years in petaluma 
calif teaches the technique to nurses at the university of 
california at san francisco 
the nurses do the real handson nurturing and healing work with 
people says cadman who believes the medical field fails to 
recognize the value of massage 
the new jersey devils of the national hockey league have their 
own massage therapist who travels with the team 
it facilitates injury rehabilitation and some of the players 
feel its also preventative at times says team spokesman dave 
freed it helps to keep them loose and limber 
practitioners also are making their way into the malls bob watt 
opened massage works about three years ago in a plaza in plantation 
fla near fort lauderdale 
watt says business is so good he hopes to hire two additional 
therapists full time and expand his office to include the empty 
store next door 
we get all kinds of people from 12 years old to 92 he says 
quite a majority of them are your average businessman down the 
street the printer the salesman the car dealer whatever 
at the phoenix and dallasfort worth airports frazzled fliers 
can drop into the air vita health club for a massage 
it makes a layover a lot easier says therapist linda wilson 
its a relief to come to a place and be able to relax for a little 
bit

editors note like many terminally ill patients fred valenti 
wanted to be at home with his wife and daughter when he died 
talking about the happy times in his life hospice care offers that 
kind of alternative to intensive care in a hospital when there is no 
hope for recovery the last of three articles 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
fred valenti died sitting on his favorite 
couch a slight grin on his face his terminally ill wife and his 
only daughter at his side he was in his underwear the way he had 
always dressed around the house 
i think its the way he wanted to go said his daughter ann 
spiegel a 46yearold new york social worker i dont have a 
terrible feeling about it id normally be freaked out to see 
someone die but it was like so natural he did it his way 
i kept staring at him im afraid to go to funeral parlors to 
see dead people but this just didnt bother me i just liked 
looking at him because he looked so peaceful and happy 
like many terminally ill patients fred valenti felt more 
comfortable at home with his wife of nearly 50 years mary and 
cared for by nurses and social workers from the merrimack valley 
hospice in neighboring andover 
mary and fred had lived in lawrence most of their lives as 
children both had emigrated from italy with their parents who came 
here to work in the textile mills 
at age 14 mary went from the eighthgrade to the mills for 12 a 
week to help support her parents both of whom by now had become 
disabled they were so poor that to save 3 cents they bought 
cracked eggs for 7 cents a dozen 
fred worked in a spinning room as a mule spinner he met mary in 
a dance hall 
those remembrances came out while the two were recording an oral 
history of their lives for john moore a hospice social worker who 
passed the tapes on to their daughter and granddaughter 
for patients who are depressed talking about their lives gives 
them a chance to relive some of their successes and to feel theyve 
accomplished something 
it also gives the person the opportunity to get their mind off 
the pain moore says you start talking about what it was like 
courting and all of a sudden theyre transformed from these elderly 
sick people into someone who says hey this was a great life i 
enjoyed it 
fred and mary were married on june 18 1939 two weeks before he 
died they were sitting on that favorite couch talking with 
visitors 
at 5feet1 fred was only 3 inches taller than mary his weight 
had shrunk to 130 pounds i have no fear he said we all 
die 
mary came to hospice first with a longneglected breast tumor 
fred was diagnosed last summer with bowel cancer that spread to his 
liver when mary was in the hospital for 68 days last spring fred 
visited her three times a day making the trips by bus 
i worry about my wife all the time fred said she gets me 
angry when she wont eat 
eating is one of our major symptoms says patricia oneil a 
liaison nurse at the merrimack valley hospice food is love when 
you cook for people and prepare food for people thats showing your 
love for them with italian people food is a very important part of 
their life 
fred worried too about marys pain frequently reminding her to 
take her medication 
she gets all the pills she wants she gets it from these people 
here he said nodding toward mrs oneil and john moore two of 
the visitors sometimes they bring them late at night 
pain is the problem that most people fear most of all says 
mrs oneil and we get very assertive about taking care of 
someones pain whether its through pills liquids hightech 
morphine pumps or iv drips if that is what is needed and we do 
this all at home 
hospitals are places where you go to be cured to be saved i 
think a lot of physicians have a real hard time with that their 
whole life has been spent in saving people and some of them just 
cant deal with the fact that their patient is dying they have a 
real hard time letting go some of them have tests and procedures 
with kids especially up until the time they die 
that was not the case with laura dahmen a 63yearold cancer 
victim from turtle creek pa who spent her last days playing cards 
and cracking jokes surrounded by friends and relatives and scores 
of sympathy cards 
she refused chemotherapy because it wasnt gonna do me any 
good the cancer in her liver had spread to her spleen and lungs 
she endured waves of pain in her abdomen so bad that just thinking 
about it made her cry she resisted morphine until near the end 
because she thought it would alter her mind just the same she 
outlived the doctors prognosis by 4 months im just gonna live 
until i die she said 
she tried to be as selfdependent as she could with the help of 
nurses and workers from the forbes hospice in pittsburgh who became 
her friends theyre so loving and so friendly she said it 
makes it easier i tell them anything anything at all 
leah george a nurse visited laura regularly checking her 
condition and medicine 
were kind of the liaison between the physician and the family 
and thats a real big thing because families become very frustrated 
trying to communicate with physicians in offices trading phone 
calls never understanding she said 
her time with laura was rewarding she says when i see that my 
visit can really make a difference in the way someone feels 
particularly in home care a lot of times just conversation with 
people makes an amazing difference in the way they feel 
laura died in her daughters home last oct 17 after she became 
so weak she couldnt walk and suffered a fall that sent her to the 
hospital she had wanted to remain in her small senior citizens 
apartment surrounded by cards from wellwishers 
one that always brought a big smile to her face was from a 
7yearold girl named macha who scribbled i hope you dont get 
too sick or not sick at all

editors note long before mickey mouse found florida an old 
west tradition flourished in the orange groves smack in the middle 
of the state is cowboy country where ranchers on horseback tend 
their herds of brahman cattle and twice a year professional cowboys 
from all across the country come to the outskirts of walt disney 
world for a rodeo where the spills and thrills are for real 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
listen up pilgrims this is no 
makebelieve stuff like they put on over yonder at the magic kingdom 
this is downanddirty bonecrunching tobaccospittin rodeo 
the big leagues of the cowboy game born in the usa 
as they have been doing for years hundreds of volunteers are 
cleaning bullpens putting up fences and readying the horse chutes 
for the 82nd silver spurs rodeo the largest in the southeast 
make no mistake the rodeo scheduled for feb 2326 is no 
slappedtogether amateur affair that is a side attraction to a 
county fair or a carnival 
this is a fully sanctioned professional rodeo that attracts the 
top cowboy stars in the country for bigmoney prizes in traditional 
events such as bull riding calf roping steer wrestling and saddle 
bronc riding 
it is the celebration of an original american sport born in the 
old west where cowboys challenged each other in contests of 
ranching skills 
set amid the glitzy entertainment complexes of walt disney world 
sea world boardwalk and baseball and cypress gardens this is where 
you get your levis caked with mud listen to the oldtimers spin 
tall tales and eat some of the best barbecued beef in the world 
to the surprise of some florida holds many rodeos although its 
certainly not a part of the old west 
if you wanted to you could go to a rodeo just about every 
weekend in this state says reed berlinsky a kissimmee 
advertising executive knowledgeable about rodeo history 
but most are not fullfledged events sanctioned by the 
professional rodeo cowboy association the organization that 
sponsors some 400 events a year throughout the country the 
kissimmee rodeo is ranked among the top 50 in that group 
another large prca rodeo is held in arcadia which contests the 
local claim that the silver spurs rodeo is the states oldest 
one of the most unusual aspects of the kissimmee rodeo is that it 
is put on strictly by volunteer labor 
twice a year in february and july 300 to 400 members of the 
private silver spurs riding club and many of their relatives and 
friends come together to run the show they oversee stock check in 
cowboys clean pens work in concessions park cars tabulate 
scores man ticket windows and put together programs says publicist 
carolyn reis 
the rodeo is americana something real and dusty and dirty 
reis says it is remarkable because it is thriving in the middle 
of these sophisticated topname tourist attractions with 
multimilliondollar budgets and attendance 
the event draws about 30000 people over four days and many of 
them are faithful rodeo fans who travel long distances to get here 
they come to see the likes of lewis feild of elk ridge utah 
whose specialty is bronc riding he was the reigning world 
allaround champion cowboy for three years running when he 
appeared here last year feild made 144335 on the rodeo circuit in 
1987 when he was ranked the top rodeo performer by the prca 
last years allaround champ at the silver spurs rodeo was clay 
obrien cooper of gilbert ariz he and a partner have been world 
champion team ropers for three years 
other rodeo athletes here last year included bareback rider bruce 
ford of kersey colo who won 102000 on the circuit in 1987 and 
lane frost of lane okla a bull rider who won 105000 
the top rodeo stars can pick up 15000 or more in one rodeo and 
usually ride in more than 100 a year berlinsky says 
some of osceola countys oldtime ranch families founded the 
silver spurs rodeo in 1944 developing it from a club that gave 
horseback quadrille dance demonstrations for many years 
club members cut their own fences borrowed some bleachers from 
some guy in tampa and they became the first contestants in a 
pasture on geech partins land berlinsky says 
geech partin is a legend in these parts for several reasons he 
also sold some of his land to developers who later turned out to be 
the walt disney co 
members of the partin bronson overstreet rohde and chapman 
families are active to this day in the club and rodeo 
were going into the third generation of club members who 
support and work at this rodeo berlinsky says we are into the 
second generation of big bosses 
the big boss or club president and rodeo director this year is 
tom booth the assistant principal of osceola high school who is 
also a parttime rancher 
incidentally during the football season the silver spurs arena 
becomes the high school football stadium where big boss booth used 
to be a coach 
the profits from the rodeo after all the big purses and 
expenses are accounted for go to charity

editors note their vast reservation in montana is rich in coal 
and other minerals but the unemployment rate among crow indians is 
75 percent at the same time exploitation of these resources could 
threaten some sacred indian religious sites thats why tribal 
leaders have asked an urban planner at southwest missouri state 
university to draw up a landuse plan and zoning ordinance for the 
entire reservation 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
springfield mo the oncenomadic crow indians who roamed the 
plains hunting buffalo are turning to professional city planners to 
help them protect their vast reservation from haphazard development 
that means zoning 
the 18million acre crow reservation in southcentral montana 
which encompasses the spot on the little big horn river where gen 
george custer made his last stand is home to 6000 people and 
second in area only to the 16million acre navajo reservation in 
northeastern arizona 
its also rich in coal and other minerals the exploitation of 
which could threaten some sacred religious sites 
so leaders of the crow tribal council asked burl self an urban 
and regional planner and professor of geosciences at southwest 
missouri state university here to draw up a comprehensive landuse 
plan zoning map and zoning ordinance for the reservation self will 
present the plan to the council in late february or early march 
the ability to control the development of land is central to a 
unit of government says self an oklahoma native and a member of 
the choctaw tribe 
richard real bird chairman of the tribal council hopes zoning 
will be of economic benefit but the main motivation is a means of 
controlling development 
we have not done that in the past and people have set up 
businesses outhouses anything anywhere they feel like real 
bird says 
the idea is not really new butwe dont know of any other 
tribe that has done it 
carl shaw spokesman for the bureau of indian affairs says most 
reservations are not zoned though some tribes have set aside plots 
as industrial or housing areas and others are considering zoning 
tribes are becoming more sophisticated in their efforts to have 
a little more control over their own land shaw says 
i think the crow are now saying we do have the right to 
sovereignty real bird says that was given to us by god not 
by the united states government and what we have left of the 
sovereignty were going to begin to exercise to provide a better 
life for the crow people 
self says treaties between the us government and american 
indians gave the tribes a large share of authority on their 
reservations but tribes have been slow to exercise their power 
reservations are separate from state governments elected tribal 
councils headed by chairmen oversee independent agencies such as 
police forces courts and the crows little big horn college 
self says tribes were corralled on land considered worthless in 
the 19th century but these areas have since proven to be great in 
mineral resources 
the crow are the sixth largest owners of coal in the world self 
says adding that american indians own 20 percent of the countrys 
natural resources 
theyre more significant than opec to the economy of the united 
states he says 
yet unemployment among the crow is 75 percent and 95 percent of 
the tribe members receive aid from entitlement programs 
self says zoning will have economic impact as an example he 
says some crow enterprises have been stripped of access to 
customers because the state government rather than the crow has 
dictated the location of new highways and improvements to existing 
roads a zoning ordinance would give tribal officials the authority 
to coordinate roadbuilding with development 
zoning also would play a part in determining property values if 
the crow impose taxes 
real bird says zoning is a first step to economic 
selfsufficiency the tribe also has plans to build a hydroelectric 
plant and sell power and the crow are considering imposing a 
severance tax on coal mining an enterprise controlled by 
nonindians 
all these social problems that are associated with poverty 
people are beginning to understand that we have to get ourselves out 
of these problems real bird says 
self says his zoning plan would exclude what might be considered 
quick economic fixes he suggests outlawing hazardous waste dumping 
and heavy industry except for coal mining he also would severely 
restrict development on sacred land where he said some of the 
highest concentrations of mineral resources are located 
theyll accept economic development but they want more of a 
say in what kind of development just like cities do self says 
there are a lot of sacred or religious sites on the reservation 
that previously were not protected real bird says i think its 
important that these sites and areas be protected for the future of 
the tribe 
real bird acknowledges that exercising more authority could 
significantly alter the reservation landscape and affect the crow 
relationship with nonindians who operate businesses and own land on 
the reservation 
but real bird and self say they have encountered little 
resistance so far certainly nothing like the legal storm that 
followed a similar attempt at zoning by the yakima tribe of 
washington state that case is before the us supreme court 
d louie clayborn montanas coordinator of indian affairs says 
there may be some grumbling by local government and private 
businesses but he believes tribal sovereignty has been established 
by the courts 
when you talk about zoning its the right of a government to 
act as a government clayborn says montana gov ted schwinden 
has no problems with tribal governments acting as governments

diane lane was apprehensive about the 
reception awaiting her in texas when she arrived for her role as a 
sporting gal in the cbs miniseries lonesome dove 
one of her costars in the epic western story is tommy lee jones 
who was her husband and a tough gambler in her last movie the big 
town 
during the filming of that movie she says jones was so deep 
into his character that i was a little intimidated when i finished 
my part i left without saying goodbye i was a little worried how he 
would greet me when i got to the lonesome dove set well he swung 
me around and said how are you darling id never seen him so 
jovial people looked and i said hes my exhusband you know 
in the miniseries lane stars as lorena wood the town prostitute 
at the dry bean saloon in lonesome dove texas most of her scenes 
are with robert duvall 
the fourpart miniseries based on the pulitzer prizewinning 
novel by larry mcmurtry kicks off the february sweeps for cbs on 
sunday and is continued on monday tuesday and wednesday 
jones and duvall both play former texas rangers who run a small 
ranch called the hat creek outfit they are almost opposite in their 
personalities jones is woodrow f call who is sullen and taciturn 
while duvall is augustus mccrae who is charming and philosophical 
the story centers on an arduous cattle drive to montana which 
becomes a metaphor for life itself with all of its adventures and 
triumphs and failures and its diverse and clashing personalities 
lorena persuades another former ranger to take her along after 
the trail drive she is kidnapped by a renegade indian raped and 
sold to a band of traders shes rescued by gus 
bill wittliff wrote the screenplay based on mcmurtrys novel 
and simon wincer directed it also stars danny glover robert urich 
frederic forrest db sweeney ricky schroder and anjelica huston 
i was one of the last people cast lane says i loved the 
role and i loved her relationship with duvall 
lorena she says is a very introverted character and that can 
be difficult to play on a tv schedule i thought it would be a great 
challenge 
lorena loves gus but shes not in love with him sex has been 
such a bitter experience for her she loves him like a father 
figure but its more than that he loves her completely he knows 
her better than she knows herself shes powerless to resist his 
love she could win a fight with a dragon but theres no point in 
fighting gus 
lane says she cannot imagine any other actor playing gus duvall 
has a way with dialogue she felt might sound licentious coming from 
another actor 
the first scene we filmed is the first one you see in the 
miniseries she says its a poker game that will decide whether 
ill get into the poke with him he cheats of course 
lorena is the true cliche whore with a heart of gold shes not 
a conniving person she wishes she was because everyone else is one 
reason i wanted to play her is that ive played so many conniving 
women thats more of a cliche than the whore with the heart of 
gold 
much of the miniseries was filmed near del rio a border city in 
texas where the cast frequently crossed over the border for 
authentic mexican food crossing back was sometimes more difficult 
after a few margaritas she says 
when shes not acting lane lives near augusta ga with her 
husband actor christopher lambert they met when they did a tango 
together on a tv show when she was promoting the cotton club and 
he was promoting greystoke the legend of tarzan lord of the 
apes 
lane grew up in new york her father burt lane was a theater 
workshop director who gave her an early introduction to the stage 
her mother was a singer and model she made her film debut at the 
age of 13 with laurence olivier in a little romance 
she also starred in the outsiders rumblefish the 
cotton club cattle annie and little britches to elvis with 
love and streets of fire 
i started as a baby in an experimental avantgarde play she 
says it was like a tribal opera it was a trilogy of greek 
tragedies once i got into acting my father was beyond instrumental 
in keeping me in the business i was doing plays and homework and 
touring it was too much for one person he was there to carry me 
through 
i must say he didnt get a lot of appreciation until later

its not easy to juggle a marriage a family and the theater 
at one time a bigtime theater career seemed almost out of 
reach seven years ago the actress was preparing to go on stage at 
a tiny offoffbroadway theater the kind of dismal outoftheway 
place with a wellworn ambiance miniscule salaries and one dressing 
room for a dozen actors 
i was thinking to myself i cant believe i spent all those 
years studying at juilliard and now im sitting on a toilet in a 
warehouse waiting to make my entrance she recalls the 
experience was difficult 
difficult until she saw a new york times review the next day 
praising her performance in the play a oneact twocharacter 
comedy called the undefeated rumba champ 
from then on she knew she would make it in the theater critics 
and audiences reinforced her opinion later applauding her 
performances in plays by william shakespeare and tom stoppard her 
honors include an obie for a midsummer nights dream 
offbroadway and a tony for stoppards the real thing on 
broadway 
for the moment miss baranski is holding forth in much more 
comfortable surroundings a dressing room just inside the stage door 
of broadways broadhurst theater where rumors has settled in for 
a run but the acting hasnt gotten any easier 
consider the plot of rumors which has been described by the 
playwright as a farce to make the play work miss baranski has to 
imagine one a good friend has shot himself two hes bleeding to 
death and three news of the shooting must be hushed up at all 
costs even from the victims good friends who begin arriving with 
astonishing frequency 
you have to make all of that real to yourself she says 
matter of factly thats the essence of working in a comedy you 
believe it and the audience laughs 
they laugh at her slow disintegration from stylish suburban 
matron done up in designer duds to hysterical housewife breaking 
out in hives swigging vodka and ready to kill for a cigarette 
this is not a difficult role in that the intentions are very 
straightforward miss baranski says whats happening to the 
character is very clear other roles can be difficult because you 
have trouble figuring out why the character is doing what shes 
doing 
when the show started its prebroadway trek last september at san 
diegos old globe theater some of the cast members miss baranski 
included couldnt get to sleep until 2 am because of the plays 
high energy 
ultimately with farce what you are playing is events and 
youre playing the situation she says its really not about 
characters and its not about relationships most of the lines 
communicate information about whats going on theyre funny because 
simon writes funny 
but its not easy to act 
with farce you really have to maintain the same performance 
every night the actress says you cant change because it will 
affect what other people do on stage you almost have to say the 
same line readings and the same rhythms when i rehearsed this role 
i didnt realize id have to do it every night 
miss baranski is one of those actresses who rarely was unemployed 
in the theater after she graduated from drama school in 1974 
although she often had to leave new york to get a job 
the show business bug bit early back in cheektowaga ny a 
buffalo suburb although her parents were not actors her 
grandparents had been performers in buffalos polish theater 
i think what did it for me was that my father once took me to 
the ballet she says i got that feeling about performing very 
young 
at 16 she was a member of the buffalo theater workshop which in 
the heady revolutionary days of the late 1960s joined forces with 
the new york theater workshop to do street theater in places like 
bedfordstuyvesant 
miss baranski studied at the juilliard school in new york for 
four years one of her instructors michael kahn got her a small 
job at the stratford shakespeare festival in connecticut it was a 
lady in waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting she laughs 
regional theater beckoned and miss baranski went out to the 
hinterlands 
i think you learn by doing really great plays she says at a 
point in her late 20s she decided to stay in new york 
eventually you have to let people know who you are 
director mike nichols saw her in crackers a littleknown 
film by louis malle and in the workshop production of sunday in 
the park with george he cast her as jeremy irons wife in the 
real thing which arrived on broadway in early 1984 
that put me on the map she says i think the only thing 
that really gets you there is if youre in a hit 
she married actor matthew cowles right before going into the 
real thing their first daughter isabel was born in september 
1984 
the actress went into such longrunning shows as hurly burly 
and the house of blue leaves when she got pregnant again miss 
baranski took a year off to have her second daughter lily 
studio arena a regional theater in buffalo enticed her back to 
the stage last spring in hedda gabler and from there she went 
into rumors 
all this would have been harder if i hadnt established my 
career miss baranski says but i felt with the real thing 
something was really satisfied and i dont feel as compelled to 
prove myself i can take time off and feel ok about it and now im 
doing rumors i said to myself see you can disappear for a year 
and you can come back youll get work

the prospect of living in a blackled 
independent namibia already has driven some whites across the border 
to south africa but most plan to stay at least long enough to see 
how things go 
for car dealer dick hattingh independence promises new business 
prospects for rugby coach henning snyman it means a chance for his 
team to play overseas for the rev cobus de klerk it offers his 
fellow afrikaners an opportunity to shed their label as the damned 
apartheid people 
elections are set for nov 1 to select an assembly to draw up a 
constitution for namibia it also will set a date for actual 
independence the strong concensus is it will come before years end 
south africa has said it will cede its authority in namibia as 
soon as the constituent assembly convenes it agreed to namibias 
independence after cuba signed an accord providing for the 
withdrawal of cuban troops from angola to the immediate north 
whites make up only about 75000 of namibias 13 million people 
but during 74 years of south african rule they have played a 
dominant role in politics and business in what was known as 
southwest africa 
even the southwest african peoples organization which has 
waged a guerrilla war for independence since 1966 is urging whites 
to stay and contribute to building a new sovereign country 
these whites are namibians said jerry ekandjo a spokesman 
for swapos legal political wing we have not been fighting 
against them 
few whites support swapo and most are expected to back more 
conservative parties in the independence elections which are to 
take place under united nations supervision but the plans to stay 
are being made with the assumption that swapo at minimum will win 
a major role in the new government 
my biggest enemy at the moment is not swapo said snyman 
head of a farmers association and coach of the territorys top 
rugby team its people who are negative about the coming 
independence 
in recent weeks more than 100 white transport workers and their 
families have left for south africa the outward flow is expected to 
swell if swapo takes power with estimates ranging between 10 to 25 
percent of the white population 
many people are praying that resolution 435 the un 
independence plan will go down the drain said de klerk leader 
of the dutch reformed church to which most of namibias 47000 
afrikaners belong 
one fears a change its human nature that you prefer it the 
way it is especially when youre in a favorable position 
about 30000 whites left namibia amid independence rumors in the 
late 1970s de klerk predicted a similar flight if independence 
materializes this time but estimated that at least threequarters 
of the afrikaners himself included would stay and give black 
majority rule a try 
after all these years of fighting to save this country for 
civilization they feel they have to stay and work for the best 
he said people are sick and tired of war 
hattingh a windhoek automobile dealer who is president of 
namibias chamber of commerce said white businessmen hope for a 
surge of foreign investment after independence frees namibia from 
international sanctions imposed on south africa but he worries 
about what might happen if swapo wins outright control of the 
government and moves to nationalize ranches and mines the main 
revenue producers 
he said swapos announced intention to reduce economic ties with 
south africa could be devastating the territory receives most of 
its imports from south africa its only rail link to the outside 
world is through south africa and its only deepwater port walvis 
bay is a south africanowned enclave that south africa refuses to 
yield 
other neighboring blackrun nations continue to trade with south 
africa because without trade and trade routes their economies would 
be seriously damaged 
if namibia suffers a manpower shortage because white 
professionals and technicians leave its our own mistake 
hattingh said 
we suppressed them blacks we didnt give them a chance in 
the past he said 
the largest white political faction the national party of 
southwest africa opposes oneperson onevote elections and is 
clinging to its support of segregated schools and hospitals even 
though both are apt to be abolished by any new government the party 
is predominantly afrikaner and swapo plans to end afrikaans status 
as an official language alongside english 
we believe that if forced apartheid is wrong then forced 
integration is wrong said kosie pretorius the national party 
leader 
everyone whos leaving the country is making it more difficult 
for those who stay he said i am adamant to stay but if 
things become unbearable well have to look at it again 
according to ekandjo even a segregationist like pretorius is 
welcome to remain as long as he obeys the law he can think what 
he wants 
to many namibians black and white zimbabwe offers an 
encouraging example 
nine years after whiteruled rhodesia became blackruled 
zimbabwe about 100000 whites remain compared with a peak white 
population of 275000 in south africa progovernment media often 
depict zimbabwean whites life as unpleasant but in namibia the 
image is different 
in zimbabwe whites are still living very very comfortably 
hattingh said they dont want to leave if they can do it we can 
do it too 
some zimbabwean whites have stayed because of restrictions on 
taking money abroad in namibia pretorius said some whites have 
shifted their funds to south africa while remaining in the territory 
to see how the elections turn out 
hattingh said many namibian whites had no deep affection for 
south africa and felt its white leaders had used namibia as a 
testing ground for racial reforms they were reluctant to try at home 
moses katjiuongua a black member of the territorial cabinet who 
is expected to help lead a moderate alliance against swapo in the 
elections urged whites to stay here and fight to make this a 
better country a nonethnic democratic country 
if this happened he said we could induce south africans to 
see that blacks and whites can live together we can change south 
africa in a positive way 
de klerk expressed concern that some blacks had unreasonable 
expectations about life after independence 
the disillusionment will be so harsh for them he said 
theyre under the impression they will get a house a car and a 
checkbook after independence 
most whites he added wonder do we have assurances that law 
and order will be adequate that our lifestyle will be safe 
de klerk who came to namibia from south africa 16 years ago 
said he felt a duty to stay and help reassure fellow afrikaners who 
do likewise 
maybe just maybe this is the hour of glory for the 
afrikaners not the hour of doomsday he said to black people 
weve always been the damned apartheid people the bosses now we 
can be what weve always preached true christians who love other 
people and want to help them

shifting winds bring either 
desert sandstorms or a cold atlantic fog into this isolated harbor 
town it is nonetheless the prize in a bitter dispute 
south africa says it has sovereignty over the town and a patch of 
surrounding desert even though it is halfway up the namibian coast 
more than 600 miles from the nearest part of south africa 
ownership might have gone uncontested except that walvis bay has 
the only deepwater port serving namibia which is due to attain 
independence after 74 years of south african rule 
namibian politicians want walvis bay south african leaders say 
namibians if cooperative can use the port but will never own it 
it belongs to south africa said martinhus botma who 
represents walvis bay in south africas parliament just to start 
dishing out property isnt wise 
the enclaves strategic value is high it contains south african 
army navy and air force bases and has the bestequipped port 
between cape town in south africa and luanda in angola 
it is the center of namibias fishing industry major exports 
such as copper and uranium go through the port as well as essential 
imports 
the southwest african peoples organization the 
guerrillabacked movement which hopes to govern namibia says south 
africa might use walvis bay as a springboard for raids 
swapo intends to go to the world court at the hague in the 
netherlands to seek control over walvis bay if this fails swapo 
leaders threaten to cut off the enclaves water and electricity 
but municipal officials in walvis bay say these threats are 
empty because water is obtained from underground and electricity 
can be supplied by expanding a backup power plant 
another option would be to build a new port or expand a small 
fishing harbor at luderitz about 250 miles to the south enormous 
costs would be involved 
the enclave covers 480 square miles and has about 26000 
inhabitants 9000 whites 13000 blacks 4000 people of 
mixedrace 
one longtime resident of kuisebmond the enclaves black 
township is swapos acting president nathaniel mahuilili 
we will do everything possible to get walvis bay back except 
to beg he said we cant go crawling to them saying please 
boss let us use our own harbor 
if south africa resists mahuilili said blacks will leave walvis 
bay and make it a spook town

at a time in the 1950s when hollywood was indulging in an orgy of 
remakes wise old sam goldwyn observed its foolish to remake 
hits you cant make them any better than they were what you should 
remake is the flops those you can improve 
the goldwynian theory gets a rare application with dirty rotten 
scoundrels a remake of the 1964 dud bedtime story the 
earlier film starred david niven and marlon brando as a pair of 
swindlers trying to outfox each other on the french riviera the 
only lesson to be learned from the movie was that marlon brando 
should not attempt comedy 
the lesson of dirty rotten scoundrels is that expert players 
and production glitter can almost offset a farfetched script the 
film has some genuinely comedic moments and the overall result is 
pleasant if not uproarious entertainment 
michael caine plays one of the title roles a polished con man 
who poses as royalty and bilks rich american women who are eager to 
support his homelands freedom fighters onto his turf comes 
steve martin a gross nervy american who somehow manages to swindle 
women with equal ease 
martin blackmails caine into teaching him the polish needed to 
invade the bigtime part of the deal is a bet the man who first 
extracts 50000 from the next unsuspecting victim becomes king of 
the mountain which was the first title of bedtime story 
along comes a naive american soap heiress glenne headley who is 
almost too easy a touch for caine the stakes are raised the con 
artist who gets her to bed first wins the bet but the soap heiress 
is not what she seems and complications set in 
dirty rotten scoundrels can be jolly fun as long as you 
dont question the logic caines gambit with the ladies seems 
amazingly foolproof and martin doesnt seem bright enough to con a 
kid out of a lollypop but the two stars are a delight to watch as 
they interplay with disparate comedy styles glenne headly makes a 
wonderful foil for both 
frank oz the little shop of horrors directs with a light 
touch befitting the feathery material the script is credited to 
dale launer as well as the bedtime story authors stanley 
shapiro and paul henning a major asset of scoundrels is miles 
goodmans witty melodic score 
bernard williams produced the orion pictures release rating pg

him a minor leaguer for life and this aging ballplayer portrayed 
by kevin costner in the movie bull durham finds himself in 
class a ball with the durham bulls in the carolina league his job

the bedroom and she plans to spend the summer making sure that nuke 
is mature enough for the majors from head to toe 
its not hard to figure how this triangle finally resolves 
itself but no matter bull durham written and directed by ron 
shelton is as bitingly funny literate well acted and full of 
ironies as the 1970s paddy chayefsky gems hospital and 
network 
the script is exceptional but give the actors their due 
costner who previously played eliot ness in the untouchables 
portrays crash with wry perfection sarandon of atlantic city 
and witches of eastwick fame is rivetting intelligent and as 
sexy as they come tim robbins is likewise strong in the supporting 
role of nuke 
as if that werent enough dig the toetapping 50s rhythm and

defense of the realm nelson home entertainment vhsbeta 
7998 rated r 
 
like the whistleblower an equally tidy little thriller 
defense of the realm is long on atmosphere its worth the 
rental if only to see how a another western democracy has its own 
dirty obsessions with state secrets 
gabriel byrne plays the reporter who tumbles to the big story 
after an old sot of a colleague denholm elliott stumbles onto it 
first and dies mysteriously apparently for a secret the shadow 
government thinks is worth killing him to protect 
its effective to see the young reporter start to pull at the 
ends of the story until a strand works loose then put the strands 
of the story together until finally 
ah but that would be telling eh 
some might fault the movies abrupt ending but lets admonishs 
these curmudgeonly souls with the old 60s epigram it aint 
paranoia if they really are out to get you

nightfall mgmua home video vhsbeta 7995 rated pg13 
 
the suns of a distant planet are dying and its inhabitants who 
have always known perpetual light fear the creeping darkness they 
call the phenomenon nightfall 
this scifi flick based on isaac asimovs story of the same 
name jumps off with a decent enough premise but somehow never quite 
manages to develop and pull it off there are too many questions 
too many holes 
why for instance do these people fear darkness so much when 
they use fire and understand the illumination of quartz crystals 
why if there is a prophecy of nightfall have they not prepared 
watching the dying stars is the lands leader and scientist 
played by david birney meanwhile his former wife sarah douglas 
has joined a blind prophet of doom and gloom who preaches that the 
blind shall lead once nightfall comes because the sighted will no 
longer be able to see and will plunge to hysteria 
while the planet loses its suns birney frolicks with a 
mysterious and sensual stranger who has an odd affinity towards 
snakes and his daughter frolicks with a robin williams lookalike 
who plays bells and has a brief romp with the mysterious stranger 
nothing is too compelling in this julie corman production 
written and directed by paul mayersberg the man who fell to 
earth but keep an eye out for the scene in which sarah douglas 
decides to give her all to the blind cult its outta sight

a place like this emi manhattan robbie nevil 
 
singer robbie nevils new album seems well designed for mass 
success teen fave level 
his breathy falsetto is uncannily reminiscent of michael jackson 
the back cover of a place like this shows him in the same 
backside pose favored by george michael in many of his videos and 
yes his longhaired good looks are likely to be noticed by various 
cheerleading squads 
despite all these warning signs a place like this isnt half 
bad 
nevil favors sprightly percolating tunes perfect for the dance 
floor neither his melodies nor lyrics will astound anyone but the 
songs are generally well crafted and fresh 
his semitropical back on holiday for instance sounds far 
more alluring than the beach boys moribund kokomo 
on the jazzy here i go again nevil adeptly switches gears 
he moves easily in and out of falsetto in a surprisingly strong 
vocal performance 
the only real complaint is that he doesnt attempt more of these 
twists and turns the dance cuts border on monotony after awhile 
still a place like this is a decent enough place to visit

concerto for orchestra music for strings celeste and 
percussion by bela bartok orchestra symphonique de montreal 
conducted by charles dutoit london 
 
the slicksounding montreal symphony renders a skillfully played 
concerto for orchestra clear in texture and rhythmically accurate 
but lacking in imagination the solo winds sometimes sound a little 
characterless this is a concerto after all 
dutoit is scrupulous with dynamic and tempo markings and does 
prompt a wide range of colors from his fine musicians but like some 
presidential candidates there is a need for more passion here such 
accuracy lends a special clarity to the light fastmoving tunes in 
the second movement and the racing passages of the final movement 
romp 
the interruption of the dancelike fourth movement a descending 
circuslike clarinet tune followed by a razzing in the brass and 
chattering winds could be a little raunchier the section is a 
parody of the march theme from shostakovichs leningrad symphony 
which bartok heard on the radio and despised while he was composing 
the concerto in 1943 
more satisfying is the secondbilled music for strings dutoit 
brings to the first movement a controlled intensity on every phrase 
and spirited bouncy quality to the second the third movement is 
atmospheric and like the final section of the concerto dutoit 
exercises good control over the swift lines of the fourth movement 
buy this cd for the music for strings above all unless you want 
a concerto for orchestra like chicken paprikash without the 
paprikash

the film world has yet to get a fix on sean 
young whose very name contributes to the confusion 
a first glance though eliminates any question about gender 
with a slender leggy figure nearperfect face and long dark hair 
she is obviously all woman 
such attributes might indicate an emptyheaded set decoration 
thats about all she contributed in such films as young doctors in 
love and stripes then last year she dazzled reviewers and 
audiences with her performance as the sensuous washington mistress 
caught between kevin costner and gene hackman in no way out her 
limo scene with costner was a masterpiece of carnality 
young makes another strong impression in the boost as the 
dutiful wife who accompanies james woods on a downward slide from 
affluence to drugridden poverty 
on a personal basis she has aroused controversy not all of it 
selfinduced during her work on wall street charlie sheen was 
so antagonized by her serious attitude on the set that he attached 
an obscene note to her back sheen later admitted that he was on a 
bender throughout the filming and their fellow workers report that 
there was no love lost between woods and young during the boost 
this despite their loveydovey appearance on the screen 
miss young smiled inscrutably and commented only that she found 
woods very intense she added i think hes pretty intense all 
the time though i never saw him when he was sleeping hes intense 
and rightly so thats one of the reasons he was so exciting to work 
with when he and i would get ready for a scene we had great fun 
especially the first two acts of the movie where our lives are all 
fun 
in the boost woods is a supersalesman of tax shelters young 
is the wife who gives up her career to join him in the sybaritic los 
angeles life when his business goes bust woods intensifies the 
cocaine habit he has dabbled with and she joins him 
the actress admitted that the wifes actions do not reflect 
current feminist thinking i think the movie is going to have a 
big impact on women viewers because of how she hands everything over 
to her husband linda brown is a person who has everything shes 
beautiful capable shes a paralegal secretary and is supporting 
them while hes trying to get a break 
his dream for linda is for her to just study dance and be a 
wife and eventually a mother in fact she is very strong but she 
decides to invest herself in this man but he cant be the man she 
wants him to be and thats destructive to both of them 
its hard to imagine sean young following a husband as blindly as 
linda brown her life has been well calculated from the age of 13 
when she started a daily journal that she has kept ever since the 
daughter of a tv news producer and his biographer wife she was born 
in louisville ky and grew up in ohio 
i was intent on becoming successful she recalled when i 
was 18 i read think and grow rich by napoleon hill i remember 
xeroxing the book and cutting out little pieces it says to write 
out your dream very specifically and in the mornings and at night 
say it over again 
my dream wasnt really to become an actress but to become as 
successful as i could be i was a trained dancer which i still am 
today i didnt want to do ballet anymore it was too hard and i 
didnt get paid much money i said i want more money more 
success more than this 
i quit and became a model and i got a lot of money for it but 
i found it was an environment that didnt utilize my intelligence 
so i quit that six months later my mom said sean what are you 
going to do i said i wanted to act she had been working with a 
literary agent at icm the talent agency who introduced me to the 
film department 
a month later she had her first role in james ivorys jane 
austin in manhattan in the ensuing eight years she has had her 
share of misses baby blade runner as an android and the 
megaflop dune i worked four months and ended up in 15 
minutes of film 
i had a lot of learning to do she remarked not just how 
to act in front of the camera or just how to act but also how to 
behave in terms of the system theres a social system of behavior 
within a film not only that each film is different and everybody 
you work with is different it never ends

tintin the moonfaced belgian comic 
strip reporter who trots around in knickers in actionpacked tales 
has quietly turned 60 
the intrepid young scribe a trademark tuft of hair rising above 
the round face with the peg nose and beady eyes first appeared 
jan 29 1929 in a cartoon strip in a weekly insert for youngsters 
in la vingtieme siecle a now defunct brussels daily 
the rest is history or at least years of happy reading and 
rereading for comic strip lovers in 30 nations who have devoured the 
23 tintin albums in any of 33 languages 
he is called tintin in english french basque arabic spanish 
and swedish others call him kuifje dutch tim german tinni 
icelandic tintti finnish tantan hebrew and japanese or ten 
ten greek 
his albums have sold more than 100 million copies worldwide said 
viviane vandeninden organizer of herge dessinateur herge 
cartoonist a retrospective of the work of tintins creator george 
remy he signed his work herge which are his initials in french 
spelled backward 
the show played at the ixelles museum in brussels through jan 
15 before moving to the fine arts museum in angouleme france jan 
26feb 15 and the hotel de sens museum in paris march 4may 4 
herge died of cancer in 1983 at the age of 76 he raised the 
lowkey craft of comic strip drawing into an art form 
his albums are gems of storytelling and drawing they put tintin 
who never aged and only late in life exchanged his puffy pants for 
slacks into fastpaced tales that took him from the soviet union 
to africa and from the opium dens of the far east to the 
skyscrapers of america 
he even explored the moon in two strips in the late 1940s whose 
drawings remain timeless to this day 
during his travels tintin found a motley collection of friends 
including thompson and thomson two dimwitted identical twin 
detectives and archibald haddock a sea captain who loves whiskey 
and cursing 
the first album tintin in the soviet union appeared in late 
1929 the last strip was tintin and the picaros in 1976 
the tintin retrospective has 300 original drawings sketches 
doodles and entire story boards by herge whose unique style is known 
as ligne claire solid unbroken lines that make dramatic 
perspectives they have never before been exhibited 
tintins adventures ended with herges death in the 1950s and 
60s studio herge employed about 12 artists but none was allowed 
to complete the 24th album that remains unfinished at page 42 
herge did not want to put tintin in the hands of others 
vanderinden said that is what makes tintin unique its like 
saying that after beethoven there cannot be another beethoven 
there are other composers but there is only one beethoven 
a quiet reserved man herges personal life was in marked 
contrast to that of tintin during his working life he never 
visited the countries to which he dispatched his hero although 
thats hard to tell from his stories his drawings displayed a 
remarkable knowledge of faraway places and customs by simply 
perusing illustrated guidebooks and especially the national 
geographic magazine 
tintin began his life as a reporter for la vingtieme siecle the 
catholic daily where herge began in the circulation department in 
1925 who is sent to the soviet union where the communist 
revolution continues to rumble 
in its weekly installments the comic strip reflected the 
virulently anticommunist views of la vingtieme siecle the story 
ran until may 8 1930 without herge knowing from one week to the 
next where the story was going this is evident from the early story 
boards showing tintin and snowy a white terrier who was to be his 
lifelong companion taking a train from brussels to moscow 
in the soviet union tintin ran afoul of unsavory commies who 
seek to prevent him from returning home with a terrible secret 
that russian factories are only flimsy movieset decors ersatz 
testimony to the workers paradise 
i was inspired in my choice of the story by the atmosphere of 
the newspaper herge said later 
tintin in the soviet union was an immediate success even 
though the story and the art work are very stilted compared with 
later herge work 
when the story ended herge hired a young man who looked somewhat 
like his comic strip hero dressed him up in a russian costume and 
red boots and had him arrive by train in brussels 
i was sure no one would show up herge recalled later but 
to my surprise there was a crowd at the station and people held on 
to the car that was to take the tintin double home 
the second tintin album sent the reporter to the then belgian 
congo the third to the united states 
tintin en amerique tintin in america shows the 
influence of hollywood films on herge the frames show more action 
and suspense in one tintin clings perilously high to an outside 
wall of a skycraper 
herge long resisted switching to color but he did so in 1947 
with letoile mysterieuse the mysterious star by then he 
was working with assistants who developed the backdrop scenes with 
herge always drawing tintin and the other key characters at that 
time he redrew some of his early works such as tintin in the 
soviet union and tintin in the congo toning down their harsh 
views on communism and africans 
the tintin retrospective shows original herge drawings that have 
remained in a safe at the herge foundation which commercializes the 
tintin character and promotes the works of promising young 
cartoonists they include the story boards of a hitherto unknown 
tintin story which is practically finished but which will never see 
publication 
it is hard to say how many original works by herge are still 
around vanderinden said he gave so much away during his life 
herges death has done wonders for the price of original herge 
drawings which fetch upwards of 100000 depending on quality 
but then tintins popularity shows no signs of fading only 
several years ago a reissue of the original tintin in the soviet 
union quickly sold out 100000 copies within 30 days

a sudden gust of wind swirled through 
the courtyard of a rehearsal studio stirring a set of chimes 
the two musiciancomposers sitting nearby had just been asked 
whether they liked the label new age music applied to their work 
that laughed john tesh referring to the tinkling wind 
chimes is new age music 
and it puts me to sleep said yanni 
tesh the smoothvoiced cohost of tvs entertainment 
tonight and yanni a greekborn composer and musician were 
discussing their shared interest in socalled new age music they 
also were discussing their continual struggle to overcome new ages 
lightweight reputation as music for crystal gazers 
the meditative quality and unchallenging melodies of some music 
labeled new age has given it a deserved distinction as pretentious 
and boring the two agreed 
there is no real definition for new age music and anytime you 
ask someone what new age music is they talk for half an hour 
said yanni 34 a native of kalamata greece who was a swimming 
champ in his country before coming to the united states in 1973 
the classically trained pianist who uses only one name settled 
with his brother in minneapolis he learned english and attended 
the university of minnesota majoring in psychology before 
abandoning swimming and academics when he was first introduced to a 
synthesizer and saw the possibilities 
new york native tesh 36 has won two emmys but not for his work 
on the syndicated entertainment tonight the awards were for 
scores he composed for the televised coverage of the pan american 
games in 1983 and the tour de france earlier this year for tour 
de france some of the compositions were completed minutes before 
airtime 
tesh joined yannis band as a keyboard player for a recent 
national tour to promote yannis chameleon days lp the et 
host worked his rehearsals around the tv show chores for a grueling 
month before the band including bassist joyce imbesi and drummer 
charlie adams hit the road 
their record label private music uses the term new music 
deleting age to describe the output of its artists and that 
may be closer to the mark the national academy of recording arts 
and sciences this year placed its new age award under the fusion 
category for the 1989 grammy awards 
new new age or jazz fusion whatever you call it the music is 
a product of 20 years evolution in electronic keyboards samplers 
synthesizers and special equipment packages which can link several 
instruments at once 
thus a car door slamming can be turned into a snare drum sound 
as tesh used in you are here from his tour de france album 
and yannis dextrous use of several keyboards which he has 
programmed for each tune has made him one of the premier performers 
of electronic music 
its the revolution of sound available to composers said 
yanni these years are very important weve heard what a 
violin sounds like blended with a cello blended with a french horn 
blended with a grand piano we have been doing this for hundreds of 
years now the sounds available have increased not 10 times but a 
billion times 
one artist can control several interfaced keyboards and program 
them for each song sometimes playing sustained strings with one 
hand while performing a fast piano break with the other and all the 
while engineering the sounds 
the attitude by which you play the keyboard has to change 
said yanni you have to be very flexible you dont play the 
keyboard like a piano if you have a french horn up as a sound you 
dont go like this he said striking a imaginary piano key the 
mannerisms of a violin or harmonica and all that are very crucial 
if you want a certain sound you cant hit it hard even if 
youre excited and that can be very difficult when you are playing 
live 
artists can and do cheat on this kind of music with digital 
audio tapes or memory chips running part of the tune while they tend 
to other keyboard chores 
minor leaguers charges tesh 
this is important because when you hear these albums people 
say oh great they spent forever in a studio and the computers 
did it tesh said i think its safe to say that even the record 
company was blown away to see an artist they had known for three 
years stand up on stage and create the music live 
we play music the oldfashioned way with our hands and our 
feet said yannis drummer adams 
yannis music on chameleon days crosses the influences he 
heard growing up in greece including classical tunes greek and 
middle eastern folk music and western pop songs his other private 
music albums include keys to imagination and out of silence 
he also has done scoring for films including hbos steal the 
sky and his music also has been used for nbcs coverage of the 
summer olympics in seoul korea 
his sound is intense layered and opulent music that works 
with pictures as colleague tesh described it 
i allow myself many liberties that arent normally allowed in 
rock n roll or jazz said yanni if i was writing new age 
music only about three minutes of the album would be there 
tesh said his job on et allows him to indulge his passion 
for music he has built his own studio and the afternoons off give 
him the freedom to compose and experiment he said 
on the television show i fight to do all the music 
interviews he said when i interview a peter gabriel or huey 
lewis or anita baker i ask them all the questions et wants 
said tesh then we turn off the camera and i say now on the 
third cut what was that great sound you got

in less than 10 years since the 
sandinista revolution a nation that didnt even have a publishing 
house has managed to produce more than 200 titles and a crop of 
native authors 
this is part of the revolutionary process said roberto diaz 
castillo director of the stateowned new nicaragua publishing 
company before the revolution the most important literary figures 
werent published in nicaragua 
indeed nicaragua produced one of the hispanic worlds great 
poets ruben dario who died in 1916 but although dario is revered 
as a strongly nationalist poet he lived outside the country for 
most of his life 
under the long rule of the somoza family that began in 1936 
there was censorship and little encouragement from the state 
regarding the arts however the sandinistas who took over after a 
revolutionary war in 1979 put a lot of emphasis on all forms of 
culture artists dancers musicians and writers are ecouraged by 
several government organizations 
still writers who dont tow the sandinista line have trouble 
getting published said pablo antonio cuadra a noted poet and 
director of the opposition newspaper la prensa which has been 
involved in frequent bitter conflict with the sandinista government 
the sandinistas say im the only poet opposed to the regime 
but there are a lot of disenchanted poets he said 
some of our best young poets are in exile in texas in 
venezuela theyre not contras but they are not sandinistas 
either said cuadra interviewed by telephone in austin texas 
where he has taken leave from la prensa to write a study of central 
american literature with the help of a grant from the guggenheim 
foundation 
diaz castillo said new nicaragua wanted to publish one of 
cuadras books two years ago cuadra said he refused because he has 
a contract with a costa rican publisher and he also suspected the 
sandinistas were trying to score propaganda points by publishing a 
symbolic book by an opponent 
the roots and implications of the sandinista revolution are the 
dominant subjects of new nicaraguas list many of the ruling 
sandinista leaders themselves are writers and a list of authors 
from new nicaragua can look like a whos who of the government 
vice president sergio ramirez is a novelist agrarian reform 
minister jaime wheelock is a historian first lady rosario murillo 
is a poet as is former culture minister ernesto cardenal 
the emphasis on the arts led to an outpouring of poetry 
romantic revolutionary war poems once relegated to the backs of 
clandestine notebooks made it into print 
gioconda belli one the nations most popular poets writes rich 
odes that couple love eroticism and strong hope of a better 
tomorrow murillo the commonlaw wife of the president also writes 
mostly love poems based on the ideals of the revolution 
gioconda belli is a good poet said cuadra but remember 
shes a sandinista 
the man considered by most as nicaraguas finest living poet 
carlos martinez rivas is on new nicaraguas list but of a 
generation apart from the revolution one of his poems is a tribute 
to charles darwin another a fourline poem called retrospection 
19401980 
ramirez vice president and one of the most popular novelists 
recently published castigo divino or divine punishment it 
was first printed in spain and he went to a round of publication 
parties in spain and mexico where it sells for about 20 the new 
nicaragua edition is doing well here despite the price the 
equivalent of almost 2 close to a weeks pay for many nicaraguans 
the book a spicy fictionalized account of a scandalous murder in 
the 1930s was also serialized in the sunday supplement of the 
progovernment newspaper el nuevo diario 
the theme shows that a leader in the revolution doesnt 
necessarily have to write about the revolution ramirez said 
the only political part of this book is that all the earnings will 
be used for a war fund 
ramirez said the proceeds would be donated to children orphaned 
during the sevenyear war with antisandinista rebels 
he was asked in a recent interview how he finds time to turn out 
books it takes discipline especially with my schedule but i 
just sit and write he said 
one of the most popular writers is omar cabezas whose 1982 book 
la montana es algo mas que una inmensa estepa verde was 
translated into english and sold as fire on the mountain 
the story of his days as a guerrilla fighter was nicaraguas best 
seller with more than 100000 copies in four editions diaz 
castillo said 
cabezas just released his second work a sequel entitled 
cancion de amor para los hombres or a love song for men a 
review in the sandinista party newspaper barricada described the 
book as not only as good as the one before but superior in some 
cases 
diaz castillo the director of one of two staterun publishing 
houses said he receives many unsolicited manuscripts but the 
nations economic crunch forced a cut in production 
when the company started in 1981 diaz castillo said we 
printed 6000 copies of five books in four months we were all sold 
out it was an adventure 
today new nicaragua is one of two staterun houses and publishes 
about 20 books a year most of them by young authors writing about 
the revolution including stories about battles feminist stories 
and stories about augusto cesar sandino who gave his name to the 
sandinista front 
cuadra said he likes ramirez short stories he compared 
castigo divino to a nonfiction novel such as truman capotes 
in cold blood but said he thought only someone in ramirez 
position would get away with writing such a book 
sometimes i think its better if the state doesnt get 
interested in literature cuadra said its better if it remains 
free

in 25 years of singing country music the 
statler brothers have appeared in more than 400 cities given 1600 
concerts and visited every state but alaska 
they have performed for presidents nixon carter and reagan 
theyve released 40 albums and won 42 music awards including three 
grammys 
but despite their prolonged popularity lead statler singer don 
reid says i guess were just dull 
theyve hardly stirred up a shred of controversy during their 
quarter century on americas stages they are four family men with 
bedrock values appealing to the heartland with grassroots songs 
about love nostalgia and growing up in small town usa 
even though they are associated with a musical genre known for 
its songs about beer and bourbon the statler brothers are shown on 
their current album cover sitting around a pitcher of lemonade 
we try not to get involved in anything controversial reid 
said we entertain and keep it light we leave the messages to 
western union 
among their 51 hits are flowers on the wall ill go to my 
grave loving you atlanta blue elizabeth my only 
love maple street memories class of 57 and too much on 
my heart 
they won a grammy award in 1965 for their crossover hit flowers 
on the wall over other finalists that included the beatles now 
the statler brothers are headed for the 1990s with a solid country 
sound and a legion of loyal fans 
in an intense industry of egos and constant changes the foursome 
have recorded for mercurypolygram for 18 years and used the same 
producer jerry kennedy whom they affectionately call the fifth 
statler brother in november they signed a longterm contract 
with the same label 
we try to stay fresh and deliver something people can depend 
on reid said were not out to shock or carry a message we 
dont jump on fads we try to be stable and make it quality 
the tightly knit quartet taking their name from a brand of 
tissues were discovered by country star johnny cash in the 
mid1960s theyve had just one personnel change since then when 
lew dewitt left the group because of illness in 1982 and was 
replaced by jimmy fortune a former service writer at a car 
dealership 
harold reid dons brother and phil balsley are the remaining 
two members the two reids and balsley grew up together in staunton 
va a town of 22000 where they continue to live 
were still close don reid said 
the reids and balsley are elders at their presbyterian church and 
the reids have both coached in youth baseball leagues their offices 
are in the elementary school they attended as youngsters 
we try to be normal don reid said we stay out of the 
mainstream of show business life we come back to virginia and live 
here we try to be normal us citizens and our music reflects that 
we try not to be show bizzy and people see that we never wanted 
to change from what we were when we grew up in staunton 
despite the hit records and awards don reid says the biggest 
thrill is still performing in concert before resuming their road 
trips in late january after six weeks off they had performed 1625 
concerts in 421 cities in the past 25 years 
there have been a lot of good things happening to us like the 
awards and the visits to the white house but the biggest spark is 
hitting the stage he said without that hour out there it 
wouldnt be worthwhile theres an alltime high every night its 
born in you and you never quite lose it if you do you should hang 
it up 
alaska is the only state where theyve not performed 
there are just a few cities there to work don reid said 
the four dubbed by novelist kurt vonnegut as americas 
poets are resourceful and a bit superstitious 
at every recording session don reid has carried a battered green 
hat into the studio he doesnt often wear it just hangs it off a 
mike boom where he can see it 
im not real superstitious but i dont like to go against the 
grain he said it became a habit and i carried it to all the 
sessions its the only place i ever take it i would hate to lose 
it 
to create their own sound effects for fight noise for a song 
they collected soft drink bottles and threw them against the wall in 
the studio 
it was a horrible mess harold reid said

carnegie hall reopened in late 1986 with a 
musical question had an extensive interior renovation harmed the 
halls magic sound 
no way said larry goldman carnegies vice president hadnt 
management been so meticulous as to remove padding from the new 
seats after tests showed they absorbed more sound than the old ones 
goldman said he never worried about the acoustics he should 
have 
two years later many critics and audience members have decided 
that carnegies old sound has gone the way of its old seats 
in a tacit admission that something was lost soundabsorbent 
panels have been placed at the rear of the stage but so far the 
results are inconclusive the hall may have only begun a long search 
for its lost sonic glory 
carnegies problems raise anew the question of whether acoustics 
is science art or magic or luck 
to a certain extent youre shooting craps admits cyril 
harris an acoustician for almost 40 years there isnt a 
scientific standard for good sound different people have different 
ideas depending on what theyre used to 
sometimes local tastes enter into the equation earlier in this 
century for example bostonians were accustomed to symphony halls 
longer reverberation time philadelphians to the shorter one in the 
smaller academy of music 
orchestras and conductors who didnt travel much were shaped by 
their halls philadelphia audiences loved the sound of the 
philadelphia orchestras strings when the boston symphony orchestra 
visited town the strings sounded muddy the bostonians didnt keep 
their bows on the strings as long 
musicians critics and acousticians trade terms such as 
brilliant and dry like connoisseurs at a wine tasting 
sometimes they even mean the same thing but there is broad 
agreement on what constitutes good sound and a solid understanding 
of the physical laws of acoustics 
when you sit in a concert hall you hear two kinds of sound 
direct which comes straight from the stage and reflected which 
bounces off the wall the ceiling the shoulder of the person in 
the next seat before hitting your ear 
the first reflected sound should hit the ear 20 to 60 
milliseconds after leaving the stage and it should reverberate for 
just under two seconds the approximate time in such great halls as 
amsterdams concertgebouw bostons symphony hall and viennas 
grosser musikvereinsaal 
most of the worlds great music halls date from the late 19th 
century and share a rectangular layout irregular highly 
ornamented interior surfaces that scatter sound heavy plaster and 
wood which reflect sound well and fewer than 2800 seats 
the concert hall evolved slowly from traditional performance 
spaces such as churches and salons and successful early designers 
relied less on inspiration or theory than euphonious precedents 
this preserved some happy accidents such as the sound diffusion 
affected by elaborate wall decoration 
but pity the 19th century designer who sought to understand what 
he was doing listen to the great charles garnier architect of the 
paris opera house 
i gave myself great pains to understand this great science but 
after 15 years of labor found myself hardly in advance of where i 
stood the first day i studied tested questioned everything and i 
made finally this discovery a house to have good acoustics must be 
either long or broad high or low of wood or stone round or 
square 
in fact the paris opera looks better than it sounds its dome 
distributes sound unevenly 
garniers befuddlement might have seemed quaint to the elegantly 
dressed patrons who filed in on opening night at lincoln centers 
philharmonic hall in 1962 millions of dollars and years of 
research they were assured had created a sonic masterpiece but by 
intermission people were complaining youd see the basses 
playing but you couldnt hear them recalls cyril harris 
the consultants had designed acoustic clouds or ceiling 
panels to reflect sound but harris believes lowfrequency sound 
waves bent around them instead as a result some bass sounds were 
lost in the rafters matters likely were not helped by 
philharmonics sleek spare interior and bottle shape 
harris was last in a parade of consultants who over the next 16 
years tried to improve the halls acoustics finally it was closed 
for six months while the interior was rebuilt at a cost of onethird 
the construction price 
most say acoustics in the hall rechristened avery fisher hall 
are much improved but it continues to share the cold sound of 
many modernist concert halls built after world war ii 
money is part of the problem halls without government subsidies 
need more seats sometimes too many for good sound and many must 
accommodate a variety of performances from symphonic music to opera 
to drama with varying needs 
changes in a hall can also wreak sonic havoc though it is not 
always clear why in carnegies case one theory is that the new 
floor stage carpet paint and plaster stiffened the 
auditorium increasing reverberation another blames the removal of 
stage curtains and the filling of a hole in the acoustic shell over 
the stage moves intended to improve the sound in the front rows 
whatever the cause the result was a loss of deep bass resonance 
and a reverberation that can verge on echo even more seriously 
some musicians have complained of some difficulty hearing each other 
despite some wellpublicized fiascos acousticians and architects 
are better equipped than ever and experts say the results are 
particularly apparent in halls on college campuses and in smaller 
communities 
acousticians have learned how to shape walls that scatter sound 
in the fashion of threedimensional wall surfaces they also use 
quadratic residue diffusers textured panels mounted on 
ceilings or walls that splay sound out around a room 
lasers can show how light waves bounce around a room giving a 
clue to how sound waves move through the same space computers make 
it feasible to compile and analyze huge amounts of sound test data 
models can highlight gross defects before construction 
the designers of the orange county calif performing arts 
center for example built a onetenth scale model out of the same 
materials as the actual building they inserted tiny microphones and 
ran sound tests to make sure the unusual asymmetric design reflected 
sound to the audience soon enough 
electronically assisted resonance was first used in 1964 at the 
royal festival hall in london whose acoustic problems stemmed from 
a ceiling 12 feet too low rather than raise the roof management 
installed a series of speakers each with a microphone and an 
amplifier tuned to a certain lowfrequency band the result was 
increased reverberation 
a more recent development is something called a reflected energy 
system which picks up the sound from the stage and processes it 
electronically to add sonic reflections since such systems can be 
tinkered with some critics worry that natural sound will be lost in 
the search for perfect sound but advocates say that given the 
conflicting demands on the multipurpose concert hall nature can 
use a little help

in a country where doctors hold almost absolute 
authority over care and questions about diagnosis and treatment are 
discouraged some doctors say patients rights are poorly protected 
and ethical standards are weak 
the japanese have the worlds longest life expectancy thanks in 
part to affordable medical care however a recent editorial in the 
japan times said the health insurance system is conducive to 
questionable practices ranging from illegal billing and 
overcharging to the practice of prescribing drugs unnecessarily in 
order to claim reimbursements 
doctors also are illprepared to handle ethical decisions such as 
whether patients will be informed about their illnesses and 
treatment says dr takashi sugimura president of japans national 
cancer center only three or four of 80 medical schools offer 
courses in ethics kyoto university researchers say 
it seems that ethical education of researchers is rather 
lacking noted writer seiichi murase in a commentary to the 
mainichi shimbun daily 
the medical ethics council has suspended doctors for illegal 
activities but few convicted of malpractice spend time in jail and 
given the difficulties of maintaining acceptable standards for 
conventional medicine the relatively new fields of microbiology and 
genetics pose even greater challenges 
key issues facing those responsible for setting ethical 
guidelines include brain death artificial insemination and the 
determination of an embryos sex using amniocentesis said dr 
michio okamoto head of the ethics council 
doctors say the insurance system forces them to see an average 
100 patients a day to break even because much of their fee come 
from prescriptions they prescribe massive quantities of often 
unneeded drugs to boost their incomes 
japan has about 165 doctors for every 100000 people compared 
with 200 in the united states according to the ministry of health 
and welfare since few doctors take appointments many patients wait 
hours in crowded hospitals or clinics to spend one or two minutes 
with a doctor 
medical care for 1988 was an estimated 157 billion about 1240 
per person of which government and company health insurance plans 
cover 70 percent to 90 percent the government is seeking ways to 
reduce fraud and make patients foot more of the bill which is 
expected to rise dramatically as the elderly population grows from 
103 percent to 163 percent by the year 2000 
japanese women can expect to live to 8139 years and men 7561 
years the average us life expectancy is 749 years 
by 2025 japans medical expenses could balloon to 800 billion 
according to the united nations population research institute 
such an enormous system tends to lure unlicensed profitseekers 
the patients rights conference discovered a couple who set up a 
maternity clinic without qualified staff and recommended or carried 
out up to 1000 unnecessary hysterectomies the couple received 
suspended sentences 
in october dr kiyoshi kato who treated thousands of cancer 
patients with massage and a diet similar to infant formula was 
fined the equivalent of 800 
japanese cultural taboos make the patientdoctor relationship 
even more difficult says sugimura of the national cancer center 
taboos against mutilation of the dead coupled with the 
reluctance of doctors to approach family members for organ removal 
has led to a shortage of kidneys for transplant there were 572 
kidney transplants in japan in 1987 but the japan society for 
transplantation says 9000 people cant get a transplant 
cancer is another taboo when a lump is found instead of 
suggesting a biopsy doctors tell people to come back two or three 
months later thats dangerous because people who dont want to know 
will never go back japanese arent used to the idea of second 
opinions said takako watt founder of akebonokai a tokyo support 
group for breast cancer patients 
cancer patients who do know of their illness receive minimal 
support unlike akebonokai most hospital support groups require a 
fiveyear survival record for membership they dont realize 
people really need support while theyre sick mrs watt said 
informing a patient about a terminal illnesses is also generally 
taboo sugimura said although surveys show that only 20 percent of 
japanese do not want to be told if they had terminal cancer

ever try to describe the odor of an old 
sock you know that sweaty survivor of tennis matches and pickup 
basketball games the kind you dont need any hands to step into 
we all know the smell and perhaps words like musty or 
moldy come to mind but they arent really exact and in the end 
most of us give up 
it just stinks we say it smells like an old sock 
thats the kind of thing that intrigues dr tom orofino director 
of the william h wheeler center for odor research 
dont turn up your nose orofino says olfactory science has many 
uses even though some experts dismiss smell as less important than 
other senses 
certainly on evolutionary terms it was extremely important 
orofino said there are many species today that never did get 
around to developing sight and get along just fine like moles 
the reason smell is not so important to humans is because we 
dont use it we dont need to there are all kinds of other assists 
in life 
the center at the university of tennessee is one of only a few 
in the country it was established in 1986 with a 500000 gift from 
the estate of the man who founded airwick industries maker of room 
deodorizers 
its purpose is any research that furthers knowledge about odors 
and even though there are an estimated 500000 scents the 
research is limited in part by the difficulty people have 
describing smells 
descriptions of odors are basically through associations with 
something else orofino said there is a very meager vocabulary 
in terms of describing odors in a fundamental sense 
another problem is that even among humans the ability to smell 
varies widely about 2 percent of the population has no sense of 
smell at all while other people are limited by an olfactory version 
of color blindness 
and unlike sight and sound its difficult to measure smell 
things like audition and vision have a spectrum you can refer 
to a rainbow of color sound frequencies and so on smell does 
not said orofino who hopes a couple of wheeler center projects 
can improve the situation 
psychology professor edward green spent months examining how 
people associate odors with colors hoping to find a link between 
the two he found that women were more descriptive than men in 
connecting scents to colors such as the smell of a lemon to yellow 
it turns out men operate under a special handicap their noses 
arent very good and they dont have very good color 
discrimination green said but even women were limited to smells 
they knew and could not associate colors with unfamiliar scents so 
any odorcolor connection appears to be learned 
still the information could be useful in packaging and marketing 
products he said people do learn to associate odors with all 
sorts of things so from the standpoint of the fragrance industry 
they have an enormous opportunity given a unique product to 
establish their own kind of conditioning 
orofinos research focuses on the relationship between the 
molecular structure of a chemical and its odor which could let 
chemists more accurately regulate scents and create new ones the 
perfume industry would be delighted to come up with artificial 
substitutes for lilacs or geraniums or whatever they might put in 
their perfumes and not have to do it by trial and error 
the study of smells also benefits the medical profession since 
some diseases like typhoid and diabetes cause odors and others 
like alzheimers disease cause smelling deficiencies he said 
theres some belief that the sense of smell is the external 
version of the immune system that by smelling certain things 
theres actually a connection to the immune system that produces the 
necessary reaction antibodies to counter it 
scientists suspect that some odors may actually have a 
physiological impact on people and may cause a change in their 
physical or emotional state he said greater knowledge about such 
an effect could be used to stop physical responses that lead to such 
problems as high blood pressure and migraine headaches 
the nice thing about this field said green is that 
anything you find out is new

carnegie hall reopened in late 1986 with a 
musical question had an extensive interior renovation harmed the 
halls magic sound 
no way officials said hadnt management removed padding from 
new seats after tests showed they absorbed more sound than the old 
ones two years later many critics have decided carnegies old 
sound went the way of its old seats 
the problems raise the question of whether acoustics is science 
art or magic or luck to a certain extent youre shooting 
craps admits cyril harris an acoustician for almost 40 years 
when you sit in a concert hall you hear two kinds of sound 
direct which comes straight from the stage and reflected which 
bounces off the wall the ceiling the shoulder of the person in 
the next seat before hitting your ear 
the first reflected sound should hit the ear 20 to 60 
milliseconds after leaving the stage and it should reverberate for 
just under two seconds the approximate time in such great halls as 
amsterdams concertgebouw bostons symphony hall and viennas 
grosser musikvereinsaal 
most of the worlds great halls date from the late 19th century 
and share a rectangular layout irregular ornamented interiors that 
scatter sound heavy plaster and wood which reflect sound well and 
fewer than 2800 seats 
acousticians have learned how to shape walls that scatter sound 
in the fashion of threedimensional wall surfaces they also use 
quadratic residue diffusers textured panels on ceilings or 
walls that spread sound 
lasers can show how light waves bounce around a room giving a 
clue to how sound waves move through the space computers make it 
feasible to analyze huge amounts of test data models can highlight 
gross defects before construction 
electronically assisted resonance was first used in 1964 at the 
royal festival hall in london whose problems stemmed from a low 
ceiling rather than raise the roof management installed speakers 
each with a microphone and an amplifier tuned to a certain 
lowfrequency band to increase reverberation 
a more recent development is a reflected energy system which 
picks up the sound from the stage and processes it electronically to 
add sonic reflections

in a country where doctors hold almost absolute 
authority over care and questions about diagnosis and treatment are 
discouraged some doctors say patients rights are poorly protected 
and ethical standards are weak 
the japanese have the worlds longest life expectancy thanks in 
part to affordable medical care however a recent editorial in the 
japan times said the health insurance system is conducive to 
questionable practices ranging from illegal billing and 
overcharging to the practice of prescribing drugs unnecessarily in 
order to claim reimbursements 
doctors also are illprepared to handle ethical decisions such as 
whether patients will be informed about their illnesses and 
treatment says dr takashi sugimura president of japans national 
cancer center only three or four of 80 medical schools offer 
courses in ethics kyoto university researchers say 
it seems that ethical education of researchers is rather 
lacking noted writer seiichi murase in a commentary to the 
mainichi shimbun daily 
the medical ethics council has suspended doctors for illegal 
activities but few convicted of malpractice spend time in jail and 
given the difficulties of maintaining acceptable standards for 
conventional medicine the relatively new fields of microbiology and 
genetics pose even greater challenges 
key issues facing those responsible for setting ethical 
guidelines include brain death artificial insemination and the 
determination of an embryos sex using amniocentesis said dr 
michio okamoto head of the ethics council 
cultural taboos make the patientdoctor relationship even more 
difficult

ever try to describe the odor of an old 
sock you know that sweaty survivor of tennis matches and pickup 
basketball games the kind you dont need any hands to step into 
we all know the smell and perhaps words like musty or 
moldy come to mind but they arent really exact and in the end 
most of us give up 
it just stinks we say it smells like an old sock 
thats the kind of thing that intrigues dr tom orofino director 
of the william h wheeler center for odor research orofino says 
olfactory science has many uses though some experts say smell is 
less important than other senses 
the reason smell is not so important to humans is because we 
dont use it we dont need to there are all kinds of other assists 
in life he said 
the center at the university of tennessee is one of only a few 
in the country it was established in 1986 with a 500000 gift from 
the estate of the man who founded airwick industries maker of room 
deodorizers 
its purpose is any research that furthers knowledge about odors 
and even though there are an estimated 500000 scents the research 
is limited by the difficulty people have describing smells the 
wide variety of ability to smell and the difficult measuring it 
among other problems 
psychology professor edward green spent months examining how 
people associate odors with colors hoping to find a link between 
the two it turns out men operate under a special handicap their 
noses arent very good and they dont have very good color

lt col george armstrong custer and about 215 men were wiped out 
by sioux and cheyenne six companies under maj marcus reno and 
capt frederick benteen dug in a few miles away on bluffs above the

comes from survivors under reno and benteen 
the national park service wants to survey a site that was 
identified as the place where according to historic accounts reno 
and benteens men destroyed everything they couldnt carry away or 
repair after the twoday siege ended 
there probably wont be any startling revelations about the

arthur m dula he signed a contract with glavcosmos the civilian 
soviet space agency dec 19 in new york and it became official 
jan 4 when alexander e dunayev head of glavcosmos signed it in 
moscow terms were not disclosed 
the soviet union is going to have a commercial space program 
there is no question about that dula said the only question is 
whether an american company is going to work with them to make it 
real 
dula wants to launch americas space station freedom now in its 
design and development stage on the giant soviet rocket energia 
the worlds mightiest rocket sometime in the 1990s 
it would save the american taxpayers about 5 billion he 
said 
us observers have said it might take as many as 18 shuttle

an alabama power cooperative has started building 
the nations first commercial power project that will draw on a huge 
reserve of compressed air to help generate electricity 
the air will be stored in a cavern measuring some 19 million 
cubic feet roughly onethird the space enclosed by houstons 
astrodome 
when a generating plant to be built above the cavern starts 
working in 1991 it will help meet peak power demands during the 
airconditioning months of june through august said john howard of 
alabama electric cooperative 
the 50 million project offers a less expensive way to meet 
intermittent power demands than the conventional alternative 
project officials say 
during periods of slack demand the plant will compress air and 
pump it into the cavern using electricity generated by other 
plants the air will be stored at up to about 1100 pounds per 
square inch more than 30 times the pressure found in automobile 
tires 
to generate electricity later the plant will withdraw compressed 
air heat it and run it through its turbines 
in contrast a conventional plant for meeting periodic peaks 
compresses air at the time it generates electricity using natural 
gas as fuel said peter totten of gibbs amp hill inc a new york firm 
serving as architects and engineers for the alabama project 
the alabama approach will save money because using electricity 
from the other plants is less expensive than burning natural gas to 
compress air he said 
about a dozen american utilities are seriously looking at 
compressedair power plants said robert schainker manager of the 
energy storage program at the electric power research institute in 
palo alto calif 
such plants are very economically attractive for supplying 
power more than four or five hours a day but less than 12 hours a 
day he said 
one project has been operating in west germany since 1978 he 
said another is being built in the soviet union and another is 
planned in israel he said

use your imagination and you can make over an entire room with a 
single small tool a variablepower staple gun 
selecting such a stapler for multiple uses requires the choice of 
one with multiple features 
one such heavyduty staple gun has a setting for use on materials 
like hardwood which needs the maximum power and one for use on 
such materials as gypsum wallboard which needs only the minimum 
amount of power a rehammer feature allows restriking of protruding 
staples 
also consider the staple guns pull or the amount of 
strength required to compress its handle and shoot off a staple as 
well as its weight in your hand remember the first pull always 
seems easier and the staple gun lighter at the start rather the 
end of a long project 
the easy pull handle requires just a squeeze so that you 
dont have to be as strong as arnold schwarzenegger to use it it 
has a lightweight nonsteel frame designed for heavy duty use it 
carries a twoyear warranty another important feature and its warm 
orange color seems more userfriendly than the chrome finish of 
other staplers 
you can insulate new exterior walls by installing rolltype 
insulation start from the top and work downward on walls stapling 
to the inside or outside edges of framing 
set the gun on maximum power and use large ninesixteenth inch 
staples drive the first staple through the top edge of the 
insulation roll into the stud stretch tightly and drive in a second 
staple repeating until done the vapor barrier is installed on the 
inside towards the heated areas use work gloves eye protection 
and mask to cover nose and mouth 
mark furlong manager of the staple gun division of emhart home 
products says you can panel a room easily with a staple gun and 
nailpins traditional paneling continues to be popular but paneling 
is also available in a wide variety of designs and colors and can 
even resemble wallpaper 
most paneling is sold in standard 4foot by 8foot sheets though 
some home centers will cut to size on request set the staple gun 
power dial on maximum and use ninesixteenth inch nailpins to 
secure the paneling in place 
spacing of the nailpins depends on surfaces on wood framing 
space nailpins from 6 inches to 8 inches on gypsum wallboard space 
from 10 inches to 12 inches be sure the paneling is tight against 
fastening surface to assure a customized look use the nailpins to 
add molding 
to create an accent wall apply upholstery fabric directly to one 
or two walls to dramatically change the focus of an entire room and 
cover a lifeless blank wall or outdated paneling fabrics with 
smaller random patterns will be easier to work with than those with 
straight lines large open designs may show seams mix or match your 
selection of fabric colors according to your room colors 
measure wall area carefully and dont forget above doors and 
around windows add 6 inches to lengths for pattern alignment find 
square inches divide by the width of material less 2 inches for 
seams convert into yardage when cutting fabric allow an extra 6 
inches in length to align patterns shift lengths of material up or 
down to match machine stitch with oneinch seams and press 
start installation first in the upper lefthand corner stretch 
fabric taut 4 feet along ceiling and tack into place set the guns 
adjustable power dial to minimum for wallboard or maximum to 
cover paneling and threeeighth inch staples staple down the left 
hand side keeping pattern aligned vertically space staples 3 
inches apart then staple the fabric taut along the ceiling down 
the right side and across the bottom 
trim excess with a razor knife and straightedge cover stapled 
fabric edges along the floor ceiling and corners with wood molding 
or upholstery welt install with the staple gun and ninesixteenth 
inch nailpins space nailpins 10 inches apart on molding on welt

one of the misconceptions about the care of wooden shakes on the 
outside of a house is that they should be allowed to season for 
as long as a year before a coating is applied 
wrong say the experts it takes only a month before the outer 
surface of the wood develops a loose layer of dead cells coatings 
will not adhere to a loose surface 
one of those experts john oberle technical director of benjamin 
moore amp co advises homeowners to coat the shakes as soon as 
weather permits 
if the season has been generally dry he says and you have 
had two or three days of good weather the chances are your shakes 
are dry enough for coating 
shakes can be finished in a number of ways with stains paints 
clear coatings or not at all left to weather naturally in harsh 
environments the resulting layer of loose cells turns cedar an 
attractive gray 
this outer layer stays in place and offers some protection to 
underlying layers left untreated however shakes can sometimes 
weather unevenly creating a nonuniform appearance they can also 
develop unattractive stains 
to preserve the beauty of cedars natural color shakes can be 
treated with clear coatings that penetrate the wood and require very 
little upkeep not only do they permit cedar to hold its original 
color and appearance but many offer the added advantages of 
repelling water and protecting against wood rot 
stains often applied to shakes to achieve a more colonial look 
range from semitransparent to solid semitransparent stains allow 
both texture and grain to show through 
opaque stains obscure a bit more of the texture but obliterate 
the grain and do not build up a thick film the way paint does 
because they penetrate the wood rather than adhere to its surface 
stains are also less likely to peel 
paint is the coating of choice for a smoother more contemporary 
look untreated cedar requires a base coat of primer before painting 
because the wood contains soluble materials which may bleed through 
to the surface to avoid stains showing through the paint oberle 
says one or more coats of a bleedresistant primer must be used 
both oiland waterbased systems are available for this purpose 
once the proper primer has been applied painting is easy as 
common sense would dictate just paint vertically with not against 
the grain for those who prefer them special applicator pads are 
available for painting shakes 
over the years untreated shakes eventually wear out and need 
replacing paint provides the most protection against deterioration 
followed by opaque stains semitransparent and clear coatings 
require more frequent reapplication 
before a new coating can be applied over the old the surface of 
shakes must be free of loose or peeling paint mildew and the chalky 
residue that often results from natural degradation of the initial 
coating 
if the wood is badly weathered oberle advises its often wise 
to use another coat of primer before applying the top coat mildew 
is easily removed with a solution of onepart laundry bleach to 
fourparts water commercial mildew washes are also available 
because each added coat of semitransparent stain reduces the 
visibility of the grain it can be hard to anticipate how the 
finished job will look test the stain first on a small obscure 
area of the house 
if you dont like the result you can step up to an opaque stain 
or paint when clearcoated shakes begin to look silvery its time 
for recoating a new clear coat penetrates the wood and gives the 
house a rich fresher look 
when structural changes are made to the exterior of a house new 
shakes must be matched to the original color the task is often 
tricky 
if youre trying to match shakes of different ages the best 
you can do is minimize the difference oberle says new shakes 
and old shakes have different textures he recommends enlisting 
the help of a paint dealer 
according to the national paint and coatings association shakes 
may be finished with highly satisfactory results if a top quality 
material made by a reputable manufacturer and distributed by a 
reputable dealer is applied in accordance with label directions 
the most important single factor in obtaining a satisfactory 
finish job is to follow the manufacturers instructions

bubbling flaking and peeling of paint used on masonry have a 
number of causes the most common are the chemical nature of the 
masonry itself and the use of the wrong type of paint 
moisture in the masonry mix seepage of moisture through porous 
masonry from natural sources and a condition called efflorescence 
are other reasons for the paint failures 
but there is a way to keep paint on masonry walls and ceilings 
proper surface preparation and the use of the right products can 
almost guarantee a longlasting paint job on any masonry surface 
manmade forms of masonry change from an easily formed plastic 
state to rocklike hardness through a chemical change once cured 
the surface may be either acidic or alkaline depending on the type 
of masonry used 
to avoid paint failure caused by ph extremes on the surface of 
newly cured concrete wait at least 30 days before painting the ph 
problem will fade as the masonry ages 
moisture is the biggest culprit in paint failure whether the 
surface is masonry or wood but masonry presents its own special set 
of problems 
masonry is porous so water can penetrate and seep through the 
entire structure as it penetrates through to a painted area water 
pushes the paint off a basement wall that leaks after a rainstorm 
is a common example of this problem 
in many cases says richard barako lab safety coordinator at 
united gilsonite application of a masonry waterproofing paint will 
solve the problem of seepage 
of course if you have basement walls that leak you should 
correct the cause of the leaking first look for improper grading 
that carries runoff toward the foundation rather than away damaged 
gutters and downspouts and malfunctioning foundation drainage 
systems 
masonry surfaces frequently develop a condition called 
efflorescence this condition is typified by chalky white stains 
on brick or concrete block walls efflorescence results when soluble 
salts present in the masonry mixture are carried to the surface by 
water the water evaporates leaving the salts behind in the form of 
white stains no paint not even one specially formulated for 
masonry will adhere to efflorescence to remove it you must 
etch the surface 
masonry is etched by using muriatic acid or an etching product 
that is milder than muriatic acid but adequate for the job after 
mixing the acid according to directions apply it using a brush to 
be sure it gets in all the pores

decorating fashions run in cycles and every cycle is slightly 
different incorporating the style and the materials of its time 
in room decor moldings are coming in again but their use is 
subtle in keeping with the colorconsciousness of our time and 
they come in a variety of materials although wood is still the 
consumers no 1 preference 
in our grandparents day moldings were big ornate and usually 
dark like the paints and wallpapers of the day the pendulum 
swung and for many years minimal room accents were the style door 
and window frame trims became simpler while chair rails and crown 
moldings the trim that separates and integrates ceiling and 
walls went out of fashion altogether 
as todays doityourself decorators turn once again to 
decorative moldings to top off their rooms theyre choosing lighter 
moldings in less intricate patterns the most popular trims are 
traditional in style but modern in size simplici1y and hue 
contemporary moldings are less bulky and much less intricately 
profiled than those of grandmas time but the selection of designs 
is as varied if not more so 
we make more than 40 patterns of oak moldings alone says 
mike fara of house of fara which manufactures solid hardwood 
moldings and trims almost all are between 2 and 3 inches high and 
less than 1 inch in thickness we do make larger moldings up to 4 
and threefourths inches with more intricate profiles but theyre 
used in exceptional houses usually older restored homes 
naturalfinished lighttoned hardwoods are the biggest sellers 
outstripping by far the darker natural wppds amd somber stains they 
are often installed with a simple sealant and a clear finish for a 
light bright look 
painted moldings also tend to be light in color one stylish 
technique to subtly highlight trim is to paint moldings a shade 
lighter than walls white molding on cream walls cream with beige 
etc 
virtually every home or apartment has molding trim around doors 
and windows and as kickboards where walls meet floor changes 
in style have rarely been so extreme as to eliminate these practical 
conveniences 
crown moldings top off walls and tie them to a rooms ceiling 
with a flourish the accent added to a wallpapered room in this way 
helps create a warmer cozier feeling by bringing down the 
ceiling joining it visually more closely to the walls 
a chair rail molding divides a room circling it at a height of 
about 32 inches usually at the top of a wainscot panel or between 
wallpapered and painted portions of a room chair rails are usually 
thicker than other moldings but match the crown 
using moldings as decorations as finishing touches to a room 
creates an opportunity to accent the main decor with an additional 
touch of color and a distinctive visual flair 
for a gracious traditional look a doityourselfer can create 
panels of wallpaper within painted walls by setting off areas with 
molding corners can be cut with a simple miter box and saw 
special effects such as rounded or cutout corners can be 
achieved with preshaped products sold in most home centers 
there are two sources for buying moldings lumber yards and home 
centers lumber yards carry large pieces of unfinished unsanded 
molding often up to 20foot lengths that the doityourselfer can 
cut to size sand and finish warning getting the longer lengths 
home and up and down stairs may be the most difficult and 
frustrating part of your project 
the second source home centers stock some unfinished molding 
material but also precut presanded and sealed moldings these 
are hardwood moldings cut to 6 7 or 8foot lengths sanded and 
shrinkwrapped for protection ready for installation and finishing 
even for a novice doityourselfer installing molding is more a 
matter of care than of craftsmanship measure carefully cut 
exactly check the setting on your adjustable miter box before each 
cut work slowly and dont forget to use a level 
paint and wallpaper first if your crown or chair rail molding is 
new if it isnt paint or finish the molding first then paint or 
paper the wall up to it 
hardwoods can be amazingly tough to nail if youre working with 
oak trim for instance youll be wise to drill nail holes in it 
before installing it to save yourself a lot of bent nails andor 
split wood

polyurethanes once considered ideal for finishing certain types 
of wooden floors have developed into versatile coatings with a much 
wider range of practical uses for one thing they now serve equally 
well as furniture finishes 
the popularity of polyurethanes is due to several things even 
though they often cost more than most of our traditional finishes 
they are almost impervious to household chemicals water rings 
and other stains they are tough and resistant to scuffs scrapes 
and everyday wear and tear and for clinchers they look great 
with the introduction of satin and antique flat versions 
polyurethanes now offer doityourselfers a full range of sheens 
also certain polyurethane formulas now contain inhibitors to 
protect them from the suns ultraviolet rays for exterior use 
since the days when polyurethanes were considered an optimum 
coating for bowling alleys which endured intense wear and required 
a finish with maximum impact and abrasion resistance they have had 
the reputation of being a bit difficult to handle this was 
especially so on projects requiring more than one coat 
the technical director at united gilsonite laboratories john 
molski says the truth is that the successful application of a 
polyurethane finish is quite simple the key is in the care taken 
during the preparation 
most often polyurethane clear finishes are applied to bare wood 
surfaces they may also be applied to previously coated wood 
surfaces but special care must be taken 
existing finishes in poor condition must be stripped completely 
lacquer or shellac finishes should also be removed because 
polyurethanes do not adhere to them existing varnish finishes in 
good condition should be thoroughly sanded to remove all gloss in 
any case a smoothly sanded surface is essential to the success of 
any wood finishing project 
many projects are stained to a desired color tone before final 
coating with a polyurethane before staining work the surface from 
a medium 150 to a fine 220 grit sandpaper 
after the stain has been applied and given sufficient drying 
time the surface can be prepared for coating with the polyurethane 
lightly sand the stained surface with 220 sandpaper this will allow 
the polyurethane to better adhere to or grip the wood surface 
after sanding is completed vacuum or brush the surface clean 
then use a tack cloth for a final wipedown if a tack cloth cannot 
be located in stores make one by dampening a good quality 
cheesecloth in mineral spirits 
the polyurethane can now be applied to ensure successful 
application use at temperatures between 65 and 85 degrees 
farenheit if using a gloss polyurethane do not stir the coating 
is ready for application as is molski says stirring may introduce 
air bubbles into the coating that will adversely affect the finish 
conversely satin and flat polyurethanes contain a flattening 
agent that must be gently stirred into suspension or evenly 
reincorporated into the mixture never mix any type polyurethane 
coating on a paint mixer periodically stir satin and flat 
polyurethanes during use also 
pour the amount of polyurethane you expect to use into a smaller 
can and reseal the original can this keeps dust and dirt that the 
brush might pick up from contaminating the remaining product and 
also minimizes skinning using a natural or nylon bristle brush with 
a tapered edge flow on the polyurethane evenly for smoothest 
application hold the brush at the same angle at which the bristles 
are cut 
a foam applicator may be substituted instead of a brush 
especially if the job is small 
dip the brush or applicator into the can letting the excess drip 
off dont wipe excess off on the rim of the can doing so can 
create air bubbles on both the can and the wood surface stroke as 
smoothly as possible trying to keep a wet edge so strokes blend 
well 
if the job requires more than a single coat sand lightly in 
between coats second and third coats tend to peel if the surface is 
not broken between coats again remember to properly clean the 
surface after sanding 
polyurethane clear finishes are available in spray cans and may 
also be sprayed from standard air compressors and spray guns 
preparation techniques remain the same as those for manual 
application 
for best results on exterior wood choose a polyurethane 
developed specifically for exterior use it comes in both gloss and 
satin types 
other special polyurethane formulations include quickdrying 
versions one such finish provides a medium or semigloss sheen that 
dries in 2 hours and serves as a superb undercoatsealer for open 
grain woods

style and practicality are two reasons often cited for building 
sunspace additions to a home but many prefer another let the sun 
shine in 
from solariums and greenhouses to skylights from additions of 
whole rooms to kitchen and bathroom remodeling the common interests 
are more light and more living space 
the successful kitchen today is one with lots of light a good 
view and good access says joe esposito executive vice president 
of four seasons greenhouses and design center holbrook ny 
people want to feel the activity going on in the rest of the 
house while theyre working in the kitchen he says nobody who 
works in a kitchen wants to feel like a servant or a cook 
even in the bathroom says esposito natural light and 
expansion views give the room that pizzazz that special touch that 
is so important 
a sunspace expands a house for anything a homeowner wants a 
workplace for business or hobbies private retreat or entertainment 
center says lee stanley chief designer at solar additions inc 
greenwich conn and helps reduce fuel bills at the same time by 
capturing and trapping solar heat the most common reason today is 
to get more living space 
the sunspace which attaches directly to a home features panels 
of front glass that bring solar energy inside and insulated roof and 
side walls 
stanley says a 10000 addon sunspace can increase the value of 
an 85000 house to more than 100000

considering remodeling the bathroom 
substituting a window with a skylight can provide a touch of 
elegance as well as more space 
interior designer alice silverman president of creative 
interiors and decorateaday inc carmel ny says a skylight in 
the bathroom can have other advantages many bathroom windows are 
located in the shower stall she says water can collect on the 
sill rotting it and causing moisture problems behind the wall a 
skylight is a perfect solution and it offers total privacy 
most manufacturers offer three basic models of skylights says

a decade ago just as the energy crisis influenced americans to 
buy smaller more efficient cars it also impacted the housing 
market causing developers to construct smaller more efficient 
homes 
but today we are seeing a demand for larger more spacious houses 
with greater elegance and a more creative use of space with 
sophisticated heating and ventilation systems 
developers have just begun to see the impact of this trend in the 
demands of purchasers 
many house buyers for example want larger bedrooms that serve 
as secondary living areas and the postwar trend to reduce the 
height of ceilings has been reversed homeowners appreciate a 
minimum of 9foot ceilings they often soar to 20 feet with 
dramatic window treatments 
many homeowners will actually incorporate a mini living room into 
their bedroom where one member of the family can read quietly and 
retire from the rest of the house comfortable lounge chairs side 
tables and small couches give bedrooms a new dimension some people 
even opt to have fireplaces as the focus of these bedroom and living 
areas 
to complement these spacious rooms home buyers frequently look 
for large adjacent bathrooms often subdivided into two areas so 
that more than one person can use the room at the same time 
in the large bathrooms homeowners may also build whirlpool baths 
with separate showers and steam showers an enclosed shower linked 
to a steam generator this provides an almost selfsufficient mini 
health spa right in a bathroom 
previously bathrooms were small with minimal and restrictive 
light bathrooms are now being built with larger windows and 
skylights to provide a greater feeling of openness and light in the 
same vein enclosed sundecks are being built outside of the master 
bedrooms these extended porches show even greater popularity in the 
sun belt for obvious climatological reasons 
for the health conscious homes will include small separate bay 
areas for exercise equipment and space for calisthenics and 
stretching 
in homes at one development at port liberte jersey city nj 
this bay area is located in the master bedroom near the shower so 
that it can be used conveniently at any time port liberte has a 
cross section of homes ranging from 150000 condominiums to 
900000 family townhouses built along a 2mile network of 
manmade canals 
walkin closets these days generally feature shelves designed for 
shoes and several hanging racks for sport coats and slacks and a 
variety of drawers the closet becomes well organized transformed 
into a storage and dressing area and very much more with a section 
that includeslarge mirrors for dressing 
whatever market developers are dealing with there appears to be 
an increasing expectation of luxury 
areas for entertaining play an important role foyers large 
formal areas are separated from the living room and dining room 
decorated with tile and marble this is a place to greet guests that 
reflects the overall theme of a home 
kitchens are taking on a new flavor very european in style and 
design appliances and cabinet work are getting sleaker and cleaner 
with much more sophistication in the way they operate 
the typical american buyer will take to this with enthusiasm 
smooth closed range tops builtin refrigerators builtin 
microwaves separate double ovens and a garbage disposal and 
compactor will be incorporated into more and more modern kitchens 
a wider range of counter materials will also be used including 
natural and synthetic stones as well as tile and stainless steel 
they are durable and easy to live with and new in appearance 
kitchens will become an area where style is as important as design

its a rare house indeed that doesnt have an extension ladder as 
part of its necessary maintenance equipment 
whether you are painting the outside of your house removing 
leaves from the gutter repairing a damaged roof shingle or just 
trying to recover a rubber ball that has lost its way an extension 
ladder is something you need when you need it 
even if it is used only a couple of times a year it justifies 
its cost which can be as little as 25 or as much as 250 
an extension ladder is really two ladders fitted together so 
that one can be moved upward and downward to suit your immediate 
needs most are made of wood and metal although there are some 
light ladders other than aluminum you should have one that you can 
handle but which suits the requirements of your house 
obviously a onestory house does not need as long nor as heavy a 
ladder as a twostory building but there are other considerations 
one of the most important being who is likely to use it 
an elderly couple who will not or cannot climb a ladder of any 
size does not need an extension ladder yet they should have one if 
some other member of the family may use it thats a personal matter 
which the homeowner can pass judgment on 
remember that if you get a wooden ladder it should never be 
painted the paint can hide defects already there as well as those 
that might occur at some later time and if you get a metal ladder 
it must be handled with care to prevent it from coming into contact 
with power lines 
when you use an extension ladder the most vital factor is 
safety you should learn how to put it up and what not to do when 
you get on it 
to be sure an extension ladder has the proper balance to keep it 
from tipping when it is placed alongside your house the feet of it 
must be a certain distance away from the foundation that distance 
should be onefourth the length of the ladder if you have a 24foot 
ladder for instance its base should be 6 feet from the house 
foundation when it is standing against the house 
if you have an aluminum ladder that isnt too long and is light 
enough to be handled easily you sometimes can set it against the 
house without following a set procedure 
but most of the time a ladder should be placed agaimst the house 
in a certain fashion to prevent it from getting out of control as it 
being set into position 
the correct way is to set the base of the ladder against the 
house so that it is at right angles to the foundation and the rungs 
will be in the correct position when it is upright 
go back to the top of the ladder grab the top rung and raise it 
to the height of your shoulders now walk under the ladder slowly 
keeping a tight hold on it and releasing one hand at a time be sure 
you have one hand on the ladder at all times 
as you walk and you move your hands up the ladder it will be 
getting more and more vertical at the same time slowly and 
carefully move the feet away from the house until it is far enough 
that point should be where you placed a marker of some kind to 
indicate the exact spot 
after everything is set and you are sure the ladder is at the 
right height the right distance from the wall and its feet are 
steady step on the first rung shake your body a little to test the 
ladders stability 
once high up on the ladder there are certain safety precautions 
that must be observed no matter what your chores are always face 
the ladder when climbing up or down hold on securely 
tools and supplies should be carried in your pocket if they are 
small enough otherwise they should be hauled up on a line paint 
stores carry all kinds of equipment for anchoring tools and 
equipment stabilizing the ladder and steadying the feet of it 
whether painting or anything else do not overreach it is better 
to move your ladder frequently than risk a fall 
and be sure you know at all times where there is any electric 
wiring do this checking before you begin working dont do any work 
from the top rungs of the ladder 
and forget about the ladder or whatever you planned to do if it 
is a windy day

do the terms involved with the remodeling of houses confuse you 
they need not according to the small homes councilbuilding 
research council at the university of illinois 
there are six types of remodeling the council says they are 
preservation restoration rehabilitation retrofitting conversions 
and additions 
preservation is keeping the building in its present condition and 
preventing further deterioration restoration refers to restoring a 
house to its original character which could mean removing socalled 
improvements made in the past rehabilitation involves the updating 
of existing features such as bathrooms and kitchens 
retrofitting is a term for improvements made to an existing 
house usually to make it more energyefficient conversion changes 
the use of existing space to fit current needs and additions 
usually involve the addition of space to the exterior of the house 
the most expensive of those six ways of remodeling a house is 
restoration which the council also calls the most challenging type 
of remodeling any kind of remodeling no matter what it is called 
is an investment of time and money 
it can affect the value of the home and the cost to own and 
operate it but some remodeling is of dubious value from the 
standpoint of financial return 
it could decrease its value and even price it out of the 
neighborhood for instance a house worth 100000 remodeled to 
bring it into the 150000 to 200000 range might bring no offers 
if priced at the latter figure 
thats because a family wishing to spend between 150000 and 
200000 for a house might not want to move into an area where the 
average price of the other homes is 100000 the remodeled house 
then becomes a white elephant unable to be sold except at far less 
than its value 
a homeowner is often faced with a choice of whether to remodel or 
look for another place in which to live 
the advantages of remodeling include maintaining ties in the 
neighborhood and to the schools better financing rates at the old 
percentages and avoiding the cost of selling buying and moving in 
addition doityourself projects can be less expensive than buying 
a house where the work already has been done and the costs are 
included in the price 
disadvantages include the dirt dust and clutter which will 
disrupt family life during the project costs which turn out to be 
higher than expected dissatisfaction with the finished job and the 
aformentioned overimprovement 
one kind of home improvement that does not really increase the 
value of a home but is often desirable is that involving 
maintenance this could include such things as painting decorating 
and repairs made to offset the effects of normal wear and tear 
even though such maintenance does not add actual value to the 
house it often is vital since it brings the house up to the 
standard that a buyer would expect 
because that helps to sell a house faster and with less trouble 
it has its own special importance there arent many bigger 
headaches to a family than having a new place to live and being 
unable to get rid of the old one 
a twopage checklist of items to be considered before remodeling 
is included in the eightpage circular planning for remodeling 
one of a series of publications for the homeowner issued by the 
council 
single copies can be obtained for 1 including postage and 
handling from the small homes councilbuilding research council

while an estimated 85 percent of all doityourself wallpapering 
is done by women the percentage is considerably lower when it comes 
to wallpaper removal 
taking off the old paper and preparing the wall surface for the 
new covering is the messiest part of the entire job martha 
washington reputedly hung the wallpaper in the first white house 
but no records exist about how the walls were prepared or if george 
had a hand in it 
the traditional method of removing wallpaper was to soak it with 
warm water and scrape it off small sections were wet down with a 
cloth or sponge and scraped while still damp a later method of 
removing papers was to apply a chemical solvent that loosened the 
underlying paste another way was to use strippable paper that later 
could be pulled off with an upwardaway motion 
steaming remains one of the mostused methods though messy its 
the most efficient method if done properly nonporous paper needs 
to be scored so the steam penetrates more easily the steam machine 
also makes an easier job of removing more than one layer of paper 
on the market now is a wallpaper stripper that is sprayed on 
after 20 minutes the paper can be peeled off though if its 
nonporous a second application may be needed to determine whether 
or not the paper is porous work a test patch by spraying a section 
of the paper with water the water will bead on nonporous paper 
nonporous papers the kind often found in kitchens and 
bathrooms must be scored so enzymes in the stripper can reach and 
dissolve the adhesives this can be done with a special tool that 
uses angled cutting disks to cut the paper without damaging plaster 
or drywall 
another method is to use a variabletemperature heat gun after 
moistening a small section of the wallpaper with water hold the gun 
3 or 4 inches from the wall starting at a seam as the adhesive 
begins to soften loosen the paper gently with an accessory scraper 
and peel it off take care not to overheat the paper or wall and 
dont use with flammable wallpaper removers

the us department of energy has upgraded its insulation 
recommendations to home owners increasing its minimum rvalue 
suggestions for the countrys various climates 
the new rvalues which measure insulations resistance to heat 
flow are based on climate heating and cooling needs forms of 
heating used and prices of energy 
for example in a gasheated home in st louis or seattle the 
recommendation is r38 for the attic a similar home in atlanta or 
san francisco carries an r30 recommendation in portland maine it 
would be r49 
the new recommendations cover other areas of the home as well 
including ceilings floors exterior walls and crawl spaces 
its important that homeowners take the new guidelines 
seriously said sen timothy e wirth dcolo chairman of the 
alliance to save energy and member of the senate energy and banking 
committee because americans spend 100 billion on household 
energy or more than 1100 per household annually 
the doe estimates that 50 to 70 percent of the energy used in the 
average american home is for heating and cooling 
for the doityourself insulation installers thomas seymour of 
owenscorning fiberglas corp offers this advice 
first measure the length and width of the area to be 
insulated multiply the two to get the square footage then 
determine how wide the insulation should be 
determine if you need a vapor barrier and what is the proper 
rvalue for your insulation higher rvalue means greater insulating 
power the retailer should be able to tell you the new government 
recommendations for your area 
before starting the installation put on safety glasses work 
gloves a longsleeved shirt and a mask have a sharp knife 
available

home improvement doityourselfers need one piece of equipment 
whether their projects involve replumbing the bathroom installing 
walltowall carpeting or sanding doors safety glasses 
according to the american optometric association many home 
improvement projects expose the eyes to flying particles and caustic 
chemicals and culprits include sawdust tacks staples metal and 
wood fragments nails paint varnish turpentine and solvents 
yet some people never think about donning safety eyewear 
mistakenly believing their regular prescription glases or contact 
lenses will protect them says the association 
by federal regulation eyeglasses prescribed today are 
impactresistant but they are not safety glasses and they are no 
match for pieces of wood metal or rock thrown by power tools 
contact lenses are made for seeing not protection notes the 
association adding that nonprescription safety eyewear should be 
worn over them just as it should over the naked eye 
hardware stores usually carry inexpensive plastic safety goggles 
including types that fit over glasses face shields and sometimes 
even welding goggles and shields 
the optometrists group advises home fixeruppers to make sure the 
safety goggles meet the american national standards institute ansi 
z871 standards by looking for a z87 marked on the fronts and 
temples of the eyewear 
it also suggests all doityourselfers like all adults have 
annual eye examinations because undetected vision problems may be 
the cause of smashed thumbs uneven wallpaper measuring mistakes or 
misread instructions

supreme court justice thurgood marshall 
temporarily blocked the second stockmanipultion trial of gaf corp 
and a senior executive after the defendants argued their rights 
would be violated with new court proceedings 
the ruling late sunday came just two days before opening 
arguments were scheduled to begin in the jury trial marshall gave 
prosecutors until 11 am est wednesday to file a response to the 
stay 
gaf and vice chairman james t sherwin were indicted in july on 
charges they sought to artificially inflate the price of union 
carbide corp stock in late 1986 after a failed attempt to take the 
company over the alleged motive was to heighten gafs gain from the 
planned sale of its union carbide stock 
the defendants denied the charges in what became the first case 
to reach trial following a major crackdown on wall street corruption 
by the us attorneys office in manhattan 
their first trial ended jan 10 in a mistrial after us district 
judge mary johnson lowe ruled in manhattan that federal prosecutors 
improperly withheld information about a key piece of evidence from 
the defense 
defense attorneys have argued that a second trial would violate 
their rights against double jeopardy the law that a defendant cant 
be tried twice on the same charge 
much of the evidence in the gaf case had been provided by boyd t 
jefferies a los angeles securities broker who said his firm was 
retained by sherwin to handle the alleged manipulative trades in 
union carbide stock 
jefferies an admitted felon who has cooperated with the 
government in at least three securitiesfraud prosecutions was 
implicated by ivan f boesky the nowimprisoned inside trader 
exposed in late 1986

when it comes to innovation in marketing 
and product development the campbell soup co lives up to its 
slogan mm mm good according to a survey of senior corporate 
executives who said too many other american corporations lack 
imagination 
in its fourth annual innovation survey norwalkbased group 
efo ltd found that 34 percent of those responding rated campbell 
the most innovative corporation in america followed by pillsbury 
proctor amp gamble hormel and general foods 
campbell has gone against the tide in a lot of ways edward 
f ogiba president of group efo a consulting firm that specializes 
in consumer attitudes toward new products said friday 
they are a big company that is acting like a small company 
he said theyve been willing to take risks and theyve been 
willing to look at quite a wide variety of offerings to find out 
what the consumer really wants to get a new product 
the survey released last week was based on responses from 75 
chief executives corporate presidents and directors of marketing 
and planning and development at some of the worlds largest consumer 
package good companies ogiba said it was cosponsored by the food 
amp beverage marketing magazine 
ogida noted that camden njbased campbell has introduced a 
string of hugely successful new product lines over the last several 
years including the upscale le menu frozen dinners prego 
spaghetti sauce pepperidge farm american collection cookies and 
campbells home cookin soups 
the survey found what ogiba called an alarming lack of confidence 
in the way new products are developed 
eighty percent of those responding predicted that 83 percent of 
all new products introduced this year will fail and that 33 percent 
felt consumer research was unreliable 
sixtytwo percent believe that products introduced this year will 
prove the same or less innovative than last year fiftyfive percent 
felt product development lacked direction 
ogiba said his survey indicated that marketing executives have 
become mesmerized by the idea of convenience foods that can be 
stored easily or quickly prepared as the key selling point in 
developing new product lines or in coming out with new versions of 
products already have on the market 
companies like campbell on the other hand have gone to great 
lengths to explore other characteristics that will appeal to 
consumers ogiba said 
they are not bashful about looking at alternatives he said 
many companies tend to run in packs ogiba said 
after reports that calcium supplments could help combat the bone 
disease osteoporis for example 50 new calciumenriched foods and 
beverages were introduced in the united states during a 13week 
period in 1986 ogiba said 
despite initial consumer research that such products would sell 
most are no longer on the market he said 
this survey was the first to pinpoint that the new product 
process itself may be a key reason for the high failure rate he 
said according to the respondents most new product development 
processes today lack strategic imagination and creative focus 
almost every us marketer is exploring the same opportunities 
herbert m baum president of campbell usa campbells 
domestic divsion attributed part of the companys success to the 
fact that campbell executives dont rely too heavily on traditional 
consumer research 
the company does a lot of research that isnt geared to a 
particular product and instead tries to track consumer trends he 
said 
one of the things we try to do is stay very close to consumers 
and that means from the senior management of the company on down 
baum said 
fiftyone percent of those surveyed named japan as the most 
innovative country in the world followed by the united states west 
germany and the united kingdom

the socialist government is coming under increasing 
pressure to allow an independent inquiry into a blossoming insider 
trading scandal involving one of president francois mitterrands 
closest friends 
both communist leader andre lajoinie and a prominent 
conservative michel noir appealed sunday for a parliamentary 
investigation of suspicious trading in shares of the us firm 
triangle industries inc last fall just before it was acquired by 
pechiney sa a french governmentowned aluminum manufacturer 
officials at the presidential elysee palace are insisting they 
will leave the investigation to the commission des operations de 
bourse the french stock exchange watchdog body 
can the elysee which has preferred so far to defer to the cob 
investigation and the slow process of the justice system still 
shelter behind this line of defense the financial daily les echos 
asked monday in an editorial 
the uproar led to the resignation friday of alain boublil the 
top aide to finance minister pierre beregovoy boublil then filed 
libel suits against two magazines and a newspaper which reported 
suspicions that he had leaked vital information about the triangle 
takeover 
a key figure is 70yearold retired businessman rogerpatrice 
pelat who met mitterrand in a german prisonerofwar camp worked 
with him in the french resistance and has been a frequent companion 
of the president on his afternoon strolls through the streets of 
paris 
pelat was among the investors who made quick profits by buying 
triangle stock when it was trading at about 10 per share then 
selling it a few days later after pechineys nov 21 takeover bid of 
56 per share 
the daily le monde reported saturday that a secret report to 
mitterrand revealed that pelat or his son may have bought 40000 
shares through a bank in switzerland and a broker in luxembourg in 
addition to the 10000 shares he was already known to have purchased 
through a french bank 
mitterrands aides refused to confirm or deny the account pelat 
has been unavailable for comment 
according to reports in several french newspapers the us 
securities and exchange commission told its french counterpart that 
it was investigating purchases in the days before the takeover of 
about 220000 triangle shares which usually only changed hands at 
the rate of a few thousand each day 
much of the stock was bought through swiss banks which have 
declined to identify their clients 
max theret a businessman with close ties to the governing 
socialists has acknowledged buying 32300 shares but said he made a 
smart choice of stock without any inside information theret told 
reporters he was the one who tipped pelat that triangle would be a 
good buy 
besides boublil many other government officials were privy to 
the pechiney deal which had to have finance ministry approval in 
advance but it has not become clear how the information may have 
been leaked to buyers 
the commission des operations de bourse issued a statement 
denying that it was the source of the report in le mondes article 
the commission says it expects to finish its investigation by the 
end of the month if it finds enough evidence it can do no more 
than transmit the file to prosecutors for them to pursue the case 
successful prosecutions have been rare in french stock market 
cases and even more unusual in french political scandals which 
often blaze through the headlines for several weeks then fade away 
unresolved 
the leftist newspaper liberation generally sympathetic to the 
socialist government noted in an editorial monday that the 
involvement of the us security and exchange commission made it 
less likely that the affair will be covered up 
it is true also that an inquiry leading to the punishment of 
guilt and complicity according to the law remains the only salvation 
for the shaken authorities the newspaper wrote this would be 
unprecedented in the history of french scandals and it would not 
mean that weeks of rampant suspicion would not leave scars

monsanto co reported monday that its 
fourthquarter earnings were flat but its profit for all of 1988 
reached the highest level in the companys history 
net income for the three months ended dec 31 totaled 45 
million or 70 cents a share compared with earnings of 44 million 
or 62 cents a share in 1987 sales rose slightly to 188 billion 
from 185 billion 
for the year monsantos income jumped 36 percent to a record 
591 million or 827 per share from 436 million or 563 a 
share in 1987 annual sales reached 829 billion vs 764 
billion 
monsanto had an outstanding year in 1988 and the company is in 
position to continue to advance in 1989 and beyond chairman 
richard j mahoney said in a statement were encouraged by 
the progress made so far toward our strategic objectives 
monsanto said the companys agricultural unit was a major 
contributor to last years strong performance despite the severe 
summer drought sales were particularly strong for monsantos 
roundup and lasso herbicide products and alimet animal feed 
supplement 
profits from the artificial sweetener nutrasweet also improved 
due largely to increased consumer demand and manufacturing cost 
improvements 
monsantos chemicals plastics and fibers units did well for the 
year but fell short for the quarter largely because the previous 
year included 14 million of restructuring income 
mahoney said operating losses for the year at gd searle and co 
were cut by nearly half from a year ago

the supreme court today rejected an effort to 
preserve longshoremens jobs in the face of changing technology 
the court without comment let stand rulings that labor 
agreements between the international longshoremens association and 
shipping companies softening the impact of containerization at 
gulf and atlantic coast ports violate federal shipping law 
the dispute six times has idled most of the nations ports 
in 1985 the justices provided a big victory for longshoremen by 
ruling that the agreements are legal under federal labor law 
but the federal maritime commission upheld by a federal appeals 
court here last aug 9 ruled that the agreements cannot withstand a 
shippinglaw challenge 
lawyers for the longshoremens union said that if its appeal 
failed the labor strife which beset the industry for more than two 
decades is bound to resume 
at issue were labor responsibilities in the loading and unloading 
of large metal cargo containers used as efficiency improvements 
over the piecebypiece loading of oceanborne cargo traditionally 
performed by longshoremen 
the containers some weighing more than 30000 pounds can be 
mechanically loaded onto or unloaded from a ship without a single 
package being handled by an ila member 
the huge metal containers introduced in the late 1950s are 
removed from ships hitched to trucks and driven to their final 
destination or to offpier terminals where they are unloaded 
use of containers gave rise to new cargohandling businesses the 
socalled nonvessel operating common carriers 
also called consolidators these businesses offer container 
services to shippers with less than a containerload of goods to 
transport consolidators offer loading and unloading services at 
their own offpier locations or by contract with independent 
warehousemen or trucking companies 
under the disputed collectivebargaining agreements longshoremen 
are guaranteed the right to load and unload the contents of most 
containers that come from consolidators located within 50 miles of a 
port 
the agreements most of them dating back to 1968 meant that 
about 20 percent of the cargo arriving at ports in containers was 
loaded and unloaded by longshoremen adding to transportation costs 
about 80 percent of the cargo shipped in containers passes 
through a port intact 
the maritime commission ruled that the agreements and their 
effect on shipping rates violated federal shipping laws the us 
circuit court of appeals here upheld the ruling but postponed the 
effect of its ruling so the ila could seek supreme court review 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for the longshoremens 
union said this case presents substantial questions as to whether 
work preservation is a right which the shipping laws must 
accommodate 
justice department lawyers representing the maritime commission 
urged the high court to reject the appeal 
the commission need not condone violations of shipping laws 
merely because federal labor law sanctions the underlying conduct 
the government argued 
the case is ila vs federal maritime commission 88756

continental health affiliates inc 
has withdrawn its 7ashare 105 million offer for healthdyne inc 
but says it has increased its stake in the medical services company 
continental of englewood cliffs said in a filing with the 
securities and exchange commission that it still is interested in 
purchasing the marietta gabased company but recent healthdyne 
stock performance and corporate moves have forced a reevaluation of 
continentals bid according to a report in mondays editions of the 
wall street journal 
disappointing results of operations the unwillingness of its 
directors to agree to any transaction with continental health the 
uncertainties created by healthdynes announcement to spin off one 
or more aspects of its business and the significant decline in the 
market price of its common stock in november and december were 
cited by continental last friday as reasons for withdrawing its 
original bid 
the company also announced it has bought 79000 additional shares 
of healthdyne stock increasing its stake in the company to about 
11 million shares or 74 percent of the total 148 million shares

the supreme court today refused to hear an 
appeal by a pest control company ordered to roll back a fee increase 
it charged to more than 200000 customers nationwide 
the court without comment rejected arguments that orkin 
exterminating co acted in good faith in hiking renewal fees to 
produce more than 75 million in extra revenue 
orkin based in atlanta began in 1966 to offer what it called 
lifetime guarantees of continued protection for buildings treated 
for termite infestation 
the company specified in its consumer contracts that it would 
annually reinspect and treat for termites without raising the yearly 
fee 
the company abandoned the policy in 1975 no longer promising the 
fixed annual fee 
but it still had more than 200000 customers who signed the 
pre1975 contracts and believed they were entitled to continued 
protection without increases 
orkin in 1980 began notifying those customers that it would 
increase the annual renewal fees at least 25 and in some cases up 
to 40 percent 
the company facing sharply higher costs for insecticides said 
it acted in good faith on the advice of its lawyers who said the 
increases were legal 
the company in 1984 rolled back the increases on its own for some 
21500 customers who may have signed up for the service after seeing 
advertisements promising that the yearly fee never would increase 
the federal trade commission in may 1984 took action against 
orkin accusing the company of an unfair trade practice in raising 
the fees for all those who held pre1975 contracts 
the government said that while increased fees to individuals 
might involve relatively small amounts of money orkin received 
increased revenue exceeding 75 million 
the ftc ordered a rollback in the fees for all those holding the 
pre1975 contracts and the 11th us circuit court of appeals last 
july upheld the commissions order 
the appeals court said the fact that orkin relied upon the advice 
of its lawyers to hike the fees is irrelevant 
the ftcs fairness rules focus on consumer injury not the 
mental state of the party accused of a violation the appeals 
court said 
the case is orkin vs ftc 88710

the supreme court today left intact a 125 
million punitivedamages award won against an insurance company by 
an alabama man suffering from cataracts in both eyes 
the justices without comment rejected an appeal by nationwide 
mutual insurance co 
the court already has under study the issue of skyrocketing 
awards in personalinjury lawsuits but the justices acted on the 
nationwide case before issuing any decision in that case 
in the case acted on today the alabama supreme court upheld a 
125 million jury award against nationwide won by henry gerrard 
clay of mobile 
clay accused nationwide of dealing in bad faith by refusing to 
pay his disability claim for 46000 
clay a lawyer purchased the disability policy with nationwide 
in 1976 the following year he was diagnosed as having cataracts in 
both eyes he closed his law office and filed the claim with 
nationwide 
at various times nationwide refused to pay the full amount on 
the policy because it said the cataracts existed prior to clays 
purchase of the policy that clay had misstated his income and that 
he was not disabled 
during one period the company paid clay 1300 a month for four 
months while warning him that if he stopped paying his premiums he 
would not be entitled to any further payments on his claim 
an attorney for nationwide warned clay at one point about suing 
the company by stating go ahead but you wont receive one nickel 
for 10 years 
the alabama supreme court rejected arguments by nationwide that 
the jury never should have been allowed to consider whether the 
company dealt in bad faith 
the record is replete with examples of nationwides intentional 
failure to investigate clays claim the state court said a claim 
of bad faith is recognized to deal with just this type of 
situation 
the state court also said nationwide failed at the trial to raise 
its argument that the damage award was unconstitutionally excessive 
barring that issue being raised on appeal 
but in any case the state court rejected the argument that 
punitive damages should bear some particular mathematical 
relationship to compensatory damages in personalinjury suits 
nationwide also challenged the alabama supreme courts authority 
to rule on the punitivedamages issue arguing that the state 
courts impartiality was compromised by a prior case involving a 
conflict of interest by a former justice of that court 
in 1986 the nations highest court said thenalabama supreme 
court justice t eric embry should have disqualified himself from 
ruling in a similar case because embry had a personal stake in the 
outcome 
embry had sued two insurance companies himself accusing them of 
bad faith in refusing to pay insurance claims 
nationwide said that even though embry took no part in the clay 
ruling other members of the alabama supreme court also should have 
disqualified themselves because their perceptions were forged in 
the earlier case in which embry participated 
the case is nationwide vs clay 88157

the supreme court today refused to let a 
financially troubled utility company increase electric rates to help 
pay for a controversial nuclear power plant in seabrook nh 
the court citing the lack of a properly presented federal 
question left intact a new hampshire law barring rate increases 
to pay for power plant construction before the facilities are 
completed and placed in service 
though completed two years ago the seabrook plant has not yet 
received a federal license to operate 
the new hampshire supreme court last year upheld the state law 
denying higher rates to the public service co of new hampshire 
which owns 35 percent of the seabrook plant through a subsidiary 
the state court said the utility was not entitled to a bailout 
other utilities in connecticut massachusetts vermont and new 
hamshpire also are owners of the seabrook plant 
public service of new hampshire spent more than 177 billion to 
build the plant and the total project cost has been increasing at 
the rate of 50 milllion a month since completed in late 1986 
the utility filed for bankruptcy last january seeking court 
protection from its creditors the nuclear regulatory commission 
thus far has refused to license seabrook to operate because the 
plant lacks an approved evacuation plan 
in a decision raising related issues the supreme court on jan 
11 said states have sweeping power to protect consumers by barring 
utilities from charging customers for the costs of abandoned nuclear 
power plants that were never operated 
the high court barred two pennsylvania utilities from recovering 
from their customers the costs of four abandoned power plants the 
utilities contended their property in effect had been taken 
without the constitutionally required just compensation 
in contrast to the seabrook owners the pennsylvania utilities 
were solidly profitable and in no danger of going bankrupt 
in addition to new hampshire 11 states forbid utilities from 
charging customers for assets that have not been placed in service 
according to the national association of regulatory utility 
commissioners alaska hawaii idaho illinois iowa 
massachusetts missouri oregon rhode island south dakota and 
washington state pennsylvanias law now permits recovery in some 
circumstances said charles gray assistant general counsel of the 
association 
in the new hamphire case public service asked for an emergency 
rate increase of nearly 71 million a year in 1987 plus other 
financial help 
the state supreme court upheld a new hampshire law that says 
at no time shall any utility rates or charges be based upon any 
costs associated with construction work if said construction work is 
not completed 
the state court said the law properly places the risk of building 
nuclear plants with investors rather that consumers 
the company is asking to shift the risk back to the 
ratepayer the state court said the company and its investors 
have received compensation for the risks they have assumed through 
an enhanced rate of return and here seek relief from those risks now 
that they have come to pass essentially the company seeks a 
bailout 
the state and federal constitutions do not allow the company to 
have it both ways the state court said 
the creditors of public service joined the utility in urging the 
justices to overturn the state court ruling 
state officials were supported by new hampshires consumer 
advocate office in defending the state court decision 
the states consumer advocate said how can the utility and 
its creditors expect a state with less than one million people to 
pay the over 2 billion invested in seabrook and to also bear the 
cost of power that will have to be purchased to replace that which 
was to be supplied by seabrook 
the consumer advocate said investors would be able to recover 
their investment through higher electric rates if seabrook is able 
to operate and provide power 
the seabrook plant has had a troubled history besides delays and 
mounting costs it has encountered criticism from environmentalists 
and antinuclear activists opposition from the state of 
massachusetts has stymied development of the evacuation plan for the 
zone within 10 miles of the plant a zone that includes several 
massachusetts communities 
the case is public service co vs new hampshire 871613

the owner of popeyes famous fried chicken and 
biscuits said monday it has reached a standstill agreement with 
churchs fried chicken inc under which popeyes may examine the 
financial records of the competitor it is trying to buy 
in return for the confidential information a copeland 
enterprises inc said it agreed not to purchase any stock in 
churchs for a year except under a 292 million tender offer for the 
company 
popeyes which is offering to buy churchs for 8 a share 
reportedly is concerned that churchs books will show its offer is 
too high that could hamper financing arrangements for any deal 
churchs the nations secondlargest fried chicken restaurant 
chain has entered into similar standstill agreements with other 
companies churchs said it began talking with third parties about a 
possible purchase of the firm after popeyes announced its offer 
under the agreement with churchs popeyes said it would not 
begin its tender offer until feb 19 the deadline churchs has set 
for buyout bids 
that is the same day a federal judge in san antonio has said he 
would probably rule on the validity of churchs poison pill 
defense against hostile takeovers 
the pill allows churchs shareholders to buy additional stock in 
the company at a steep discount with many more shares to be bought 
the price of a hostile takeover would soar 
popeyes says it owns or has been tendered 45 percent of churchs 
nearly 37 million outstanding shares

european foreign ministers today agreed 
to impose stiff duties on some us imports but delayed implementing 
the sanctions to give both sides time to resolve a transatlantic 
trade dispute 
spainish foreign minister francisco fernandez ordonez warned that 
the 12nation european economic community will levy the tariffs if 
there is no move to ease the conflict by midfebruary 
we hope the new north american administration will adopt a more 
intelligent attitude fernandez ordonez said 
american officials said they were pleased with the delay by the 
trading bloc known as the common market 
we want to make every effort to first contain and then resolve 
this dispute and this decision is clearly a positive step in 
that direction the us mission to the community said in a 
statement 
but the statement also said officials were very concerned 
about the ministers decision to approve a list of products that 
could eventually be the target of counterretaliation 
the dispute was touched off by the eecs decision to impose a 
jan 1 ban on us meat from cattle treated with growth hormones 
the united states retaliated with higher tariffs on a variety of 
products from the trading bloc 
representatives of the european nations earlier this month agreed 
on a series of countermeasures to boost duties to 100 percent on 
us imports of unshelled walnuts and dried fruit including 
apricots peaches prunes apples and pears each round of tariffs 
affects about 100 million in trade 
the european commission the trading groups executive body 
asked the ministers to impose the retaliatory tariffs on feb 1 
but fernandez ordonez said the ministers decided against setting 
a date so as not to diminish room for maneuvering we have with the 
new administration of president george bush 
the ministers said in a statement they will take stock of the 
situation at their feb 20 meeting 
the countermeasures will be put into effect unless there is 
satisfactory process in the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
or in bilateral negotiations with the united states the statement 
said 
the community will ask the 96nation gatt at a feb 8 meeting to 
declare the us retaliatory duties in violation of the 
international bodys rules 
by delaying implementation of its own retaliatory measures the 
eec will ease at least temporarily tensions surrounding the 
conflict which stems from the common markets decision to ban for 
health reasons meat from animals treated with growth hormones 
us officials maintain that the use of certain hormones to 
fatten animals a common practice among american farmers does not 
pose a health risk

the new president of the national 
wheatgrowers association expects another season of drought 
predicting it could ruin some farmers who survived last years lack 
of moisture 
reggie wyckoff of genoa a thirdgeneration colorado farmer who 
operates a 6000acre farm homesteaded by his grandfather became 
president of the 60000member wheatgrowers group last week and 
immediately made some pessimistic observations 
everywhere ive been this fall and winter except in 
southeastern washington state everybody is dry said wyckoff 
his organization active in 18 states represents farmers producing 
85 percent of the nations wheat 
i was in montana in december and there was absolutely no snow 
50degree weather and they have no reserve moisture in their soil 
at all he said montana north dakota south dakota are all 
dry and theyll need a lot of moisture to make a good crop 
wyckoff said the winter wheat crop now in the ground is fairly 
resilient and still can be saved with timely spring rains and snows 
noting that last years small wheat crop and export demand cut 
surplus wheat from 2 billion bushels to 530 million bushels wyckoff 
said if we had another short crop this year it could mean some 
tremendously high prices for farmers but what good is that if you 
dont have anything to sell 
he said even colorado which dodged the drought and produced good 
crops last year is far drier this winter on the plains 
if you measure precipitation in october and november compared 
to previous years its the seconddriest in 81 years said wayne 
shawcroft a colorado state university scientist at the agricultural 
research station in akron 
if you measure the last four months of 1988 its the 10th 
driest in 81 years shawcroft said 
mike gillespie snow survey supervisor for the us soil 
conservation service said snowpack in the colorado mountains was 94 
percent of normal on jan 1 while the snowpack is comforting to 
farmers who work colorados 900000 irrigated acres of corn and 
wheat it provides little solace to farmers who grow wheat on 23 
million acres of nonirrigated land on the eastern plains 
precipitation on the plains in the arkansas river basin has 
been only 65 percent of average and in the south platte basin its 
been only 68 percent of average so the plains have been dry since 
the first of october said gillespie 
he said idaho wyoming montana and utah are having another in a 
series of very dry winters with snowpack ranging from 80 percent 
to 96 percent of normal 
were not doing real well in those areas they could use 
aboveaverage snowpacks just to make up the deficits theyve had in 
their storage reservoirs said gillespie

for the fourth week in a row the number of 
working oil and natural gas rigs has taken a plunge this week by 51 
to total 789 industry watcher baker hughes inc reported 
for the past three weeks the count has dropped twice by 32 and 
once by 36 following a twoweek increase of 25 rigs last week the 
rig count totaled 840 a year ago the number of rigs totaled 1026 
baker hughes said monday 
the decline follows normal seasonal patterns according to baker 
hughes economist ike kerridge 
i hoping it would taper off by now kerridge said i have 
no particular explanation for it i have not heard of any weather 
conditions being a problem 
the count usually drops off during late december through late 
march or early april he said it doesnt always follow that 
pattern well just have to wait and see 
the count is a widely watched industry index of drilling activity 
and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as of 
last friday not the number of rigs actively producing oil 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the number of working rigs since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 per 
42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in the 
rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes began 
compiling figures 
the lowest level last year was the reported 880 rigs on may 2 
among major oil producing states only two saw an increase in rig 
activity ohio by five and pennsylvania by four michigan and 
wyoming saw no change from last week 
louisiana saw the steepest decline with 18 fewer rigs followed 
by oklahoma 12 new mexico 10 texas seven california and 
kansas four each colorado two and north dakota one

fairchild industries inc which last week 
rejected an unsolicited takeover bid from the carlyle group said 
monday it had adopted a plan to protect stockholders in case of 
unfriendly takeover bids 
fairchild a defense electronics contractor said its 
shareholders would receive rights entitling them to buy more stock 
in fairchild at a discount in certain cases where a hostile bidder 
acquired 20 percent or more of fairchilds common shares 
the rights approved saturday by the board of directors would 
also entitle fairchild shareholders to buy stock in the buyer at a 
discount if the buyer managed to acquire fairchild 
the carlyle group a washington dcbased investment 
partnership that offered 264 million for fairchild had said last 
week it would review its options after fairchild rejected its offer 
stephen norris a carlyle managing director was said to be in a 
meeting monday and not available for comment on the antitakeover 
measures 
fairchild spokeswoman deborah m tucker said the rights plan was 
not solely a response to the carlyle offer 
fairchild said four existing shareholders that operate as a group 
would be able to raise their combined ownership to 2499 percent of 
voting stock without triggering the rights the four george soros 
harvey l karp quantum fund nv and bozsi limited partnership were 
covered by a previous agreement that limited their ownership to 25 
percent of the voting stock 
the rights which will be issued as special dividends are 
intended to protect shareholders against a purchase at an inadequate 
price partial or twotier takeover attempts coercive stock 
accumulation programs and other tactics designed to gain control of 
the company without offering what fairchild called an adequate 
price to all stockholders according to the company 
the distribution of rights will be made to common stockholders of 
record on feb 2 and shares of common stock that are newlyissued 
after that date will also carry rights the company said the rights 
will expire in 10 years and fairchild may redeem them for 1 cent 
each at anytime before a buyer acquires a 20 percent position in the 
company and under certain other circumstances

when presidential campaigner george bush said 
that if elected he wouldnt raise taxes his sincerity was 
questioned when nominee bush said it again the doubts grew they 
continue under president bush 
the doubts are expressed by wageearners who may have grown a bit 
cynical by the media by corporate executives with a smattering of 
economic theory by economists who argue that it is simply illogical 
not to seize the opportunity 
rarely has there been such a consensus that higher taxes are the 
way to solve the budget deficit the trade deficit the plight of 
the homeless the nations health problems and almost any other 
social or economic need 
and seldom has a president so blithely dismissed the pressure 
the widespread view that taxes are the way to go illustrates how 
tenacious a hold the taxandspend mentality has on people who you 
may have heard began their new country with a dedication to 
restrained government and taxes 
is the new president naive you judge 
under the budget projections submitted by ronald reagan who 
fought but probably didnt succeed in keeping taxes down individual 
income tax receipts and social insurance tax receipts are projected 
to rise 9 percent in 1990 
that 9 percent revenue increase would follow a 7 percent increase 
in 1989 and a 6 percent increase in 1988 receipts go up even when 
rates dont because of the expansion of the economy 
individual income taxes plus social insurance taxes and 
contributions are projected to equal 161 percent of gross national 
product by 1993 
except for wartime or recession 16 percent is an exceptional 
number in 1988 the percentages was 154 in 1975 it was only 
135 and if you go back to the preworld war ii period it would of 
course be in single numbers 
without help from increases individual income taxes as a percent 
of gross national product will amount to 89 percent compared with 
just 8 percent in 1975 social insurance taxes will be 72 percent 
against 55 percent in 1975 
after compiling and analyzing these figures john wright 
chairman of wright investors service and a noted economic 
researcher wrights data banks are used regularly by top corporate 
and institutional economists states 
one can understand george bushs reluctance to ask for new 
taxes and appreciate his concern that higher taxes could jeopardize 
the economic expansion 
incredibly the doubts the criticisms the accusations continue 
to build from those who believe that restrained spending and 
continued economic growth cant do a better job than taxes in 
correcting current economic imbalances 
while bush has surrounded himself with practical economic brains 
he is still referred to as naive in some economic epistles written 
from wall street and academe some of them by theorists who served 
in previous administrations 
the doubts include questions about the mans sincerity 
understanding and directness it is widely felt that some devious 
tax plan is hidden somewhere in the white house awaiting a more 
propitious time 
but unless the president is prepared to eat his words apologize 
to the people and accept the negative political consequences there 
seems no way for him to back off from his promises 
but when you look at some of the numbers you might ask why 
should he

a flurry of mergers in the canadian airline beer 
and gasoline industries has touched off concern about the potential 
for reduced competition and higher prices 
mergers are not new to canadian business and corporate 
consolidation long has been a controversial subject but three big 
deals in as many days last week was considered an unusually intense 
level of activity 
there also were predictions those deals could mark the start of a 
bigger merger trend as companies strive to grow to meet global 
competition partly due to the free trade agreement with the united 
states that went into effect jan 1 
it means big business is getting bigger and that means higher 
prices in this case big is definitely not better david mckendry 
of the consumers association of canada told the toronto sun 
last wednesday molson and carling okeefe breweries announced a 
merger forming canadas largest beer company with 53 percent of the 
market current leader john labatt ltd has a 43 percent share 
molson and carling were canadas second and thirdlargest brewers 
respectively 
a top goal for the new molson breweries company is to more than 
double exports to the united states where canadian beer has been 
gaining popularity 
on thursday canadian airlines international announced it was 
buying out wardair for about 2024 million in cash and stock the 
smaller wardair had run a lower fare operation and the sale is seen 
as reducing fare pressure on privatelyowned canadian and on air 
canada which is 55 percent owned by the government 
on friday imperial oil ltd the nations biggest oil company 
won bidding for no 4 texaco canada inc with an offer totaling 
about 41 billion imperial is 70 percent owned by exxon corp the 
biggest us oil company 
the only larger deal in the canadian oil industry was last years 
46 billion purchase of dome petroleum ltd by amoco canada 
the free trade issue was muted in the weeks merger announcements 
because the canadian beer industry received special protection in 
the pact signed last year by prime minister brian mulroney and 
thenpresident reagan american airlines did not get unlimited 
access to canadian airports under the deal and local gas stations 
were exempted 
quoting figures from the federal bureau of competition the globe 
and mail newspaper has indicated the number of acquisitions in 
canada increased from 641 in 1984 to 1082 in 1987 
a recent study by the governments statistics canada agency 
showed the share of business assets held by the top 25 canadian 
corporations increased to 351 percent in 1986 from 296 percent 10 
years earlier 
shirley carr president of the canadian labor congress said she 
was concerned about the potential for lost jobs 
the corporations decided we should have free trade and now 
ever since the election weve been hearing about nothing but 
mergers and closures she told the toronto star 
parliament approved the free trade agreement after mulroneys 
progressive conservative party won its second consecutive majority 
government in the nov 21 election 
imperial which markets under the esso brand in canada 
guaranteed the jobs and benefits of the 3300 texaco employees but 
some job reduction was expected as a result of the beer and airline 
mergers 
calvin goldman director of the federal bureau of competition 
has cautioned companies against completing merger arrangements 
without authorization 
companies would be taking a chance were they to close a deal 
before the competition bureau has had the opportunity to conduct a 
full and thorough investigation of the proposed transaction he 
said in a statement that capped last weeks merger binge 
federal regulations require companies to wait 21 days from 
announcement to complete a merger although the competition bureau 
still can require changes after that threeweek period 
the bureau of competition has forced nine companies to 
restructure or abandon mergers since 1986 while at least two others 
were brought before a competition tribunal for public hearings 
according to the globe and mail

merrill lynch amp co monday said its earnings rose 
sharply in the fourth quarter and all of 1988 as a huge 
pensionrelated gain and other factors offset a onethird drop in 
its commission revenue 
merrill lynch reported fourthquarter profits of 2758 million 
rebounding from almost negligible earnings in the same period in 
1987 when the stock market crashed 
the nations thirdlargest securities firms earnings equal to 
269 a share were far above the earnings of 15 million in the 
same period a year earlier there were no earnings per common share 
in the 1987 quarter after payment of preferred dividends 
revenue rose to 285 billion from 235 billion for the same 
1987 quarter for the full year merrill lynch had earnings of 463 
million or 429 a share including a huge aftertax gain from the 
termination of an employee benefits plan that was up 38 percent 
from 335 million or 307 a share in 1987 
revenue for the year rose 7 percent to 105 billion from 988 
billion in 1987 the 1988 period consisted of 53 weeks of operations 
compared to 52 weeks the previous year 
the biggest contribution to earnings was a 2547 million 
aftertax gain from the termination last october of a pension plan 
that covered nearly all us employees the savings came from tax 
provisions allowing a company to transfer funds from a terminated 
pension plan to an employee stock ownership plan as merrill lynch 
did 
merrill lynch said its commission revenue fell 333 percent for 
the full year and 315 percent in the fourth quarter but revenue 
from investment banking principal transactions and interest and 
dividends rose 
merrill lynch said that while retail demand for investment 
products has slowed since the oct 19 1987 market crash customer 
assets under management were up 
merrill lynch also said it charged 444 million against 
fourthquarter earnings to merge or shrink some foreign and domestic 
branch offices 
earnings for the quarter and full year of 1987 were restated to 
reflect a change in the method of accounting for income taxes the 
restatement reduced net income by 554 million for the year and 2 
million for the fourth quarter 
prior to the restatement merrill lynch reported 1987 earnings of 
3906 million

that coastals bid would eventually be accepted he said 
officials of coastal which made its offer for texas eastern last 
week said they are not worried about another bidder 
if they give us the same information thats fine coastal 
spokesman rw wells said weve said all along that if they show 
us that our price is too low were willing to discuss anything 
including price 
james r paul coastals president and chief operating officer 
said increasing his companys bid of 42 per share at this time 
would be like going to an auction and bidding against ourselves 
we have the best and only offer on the table right now 
hendrix said the texas eastern board was disappointed coastal did 
not increase its offer when paul and james r cordes executive vice 
president of coastal met sunday with the board 
industry observers had predicted a friendly merger agreement 
could emerge from the talks particularly if the offering price was 
raised to between 45 and 47 a share 
coastal officials told the board they continue to believe 42 
is a full and fair price despite the fact that texas easterns stock 
has traded above the coastal bid price since the bid was 
announced hendrix said 
texas easterns stock was trading at 4862 on the new york 
stock exchange monday up from its close of 4725 on friday 
hendrix said the texas eastern board would meet again next 
weekend to consider coastals bid when more details are known and 
advisers had completed further analysis 
since coastals offer the two houstonbased natural gas 
companies have been in and out of court trying to prevent texas 
eastern directors from implementing antitakeover measures 
us district judge lynn hughes in houston issued an injunction 
to prevent texas eastern from initiating litigation in another court 
without his permission but friday the us 5th circuit court of 
appeals stayed hughes injunction 
hughes ruling came after coastal and two texas eastern 
stockholders filed suits seeking an injunction to keep texas eastern 
from using a poison pill to stop the tender offer 
a poison pill typically is a measure that makes a hostile 
takeover of a company prohibitively expensive hughes consolidated 
the suits and set a hearing for feb 6 
after hughes injunction was lifted texas eastern filed a 
lawsuit against coastal and colorado interstate corp coastals 
wholly owned subsidiary in a chancery court in delaware the suit 
asks the court to rule that texas easterns share purchase rights 
plan what coastal and the two stockholders refer to as the 
poison pill is lawful the plan was adopted in 1986 by the 
companys board of diretors

wheat futures prices were mostly higher while 
prices for corn were mixed and soybeans mostly lower at the close 
monday on the chicago board of trade 
wheat futures were supported by reports that the soviet union was 
bidding on 660000 tons of us export bonus wheat and that the 
philippines was seeking offers on 365000 tons of the commodity 
said grains analyst jerry gidel of gh miller 
heavy weekend rains in brazil and northern argentina helped 
improve the soybean crops there and bring a negative mood to soybean 
trading said gidel 
volume was modest and continues to be affected by the fbi probe 
of the futures markets in chicago gidel said 
generally it has had some effect he said it has caused 
some confusion among traders 
traders consider the markets oversold recently and mondays 
gains reflected mostly a technical bounce following big losses 
said victor lespinasse a grains specialist with dean witter 
reynolds inc 
at the close of trading wheat was unchanged to 2 cents higher 
with the contract for delivery in march at 447 a bushel corn was 
1 cent lower to 1 cents higher with the contract for delivery in 
march at 269 a bushel oats were unchanged to 2 cents higher with 
march at 236 a bushel and soybeans were unchanged to 8 cents 
lower with the march contract at 750 a bushel

washington the supreme court monday refused to let public 
service co of new hampshire increase electric rates to help pay for 
its share of the controversial seabrook nuclear power plant 
separately the high court let stand a california rule that 
virtually bans all lawyer advertisements featuring testimonials or 
client endorsements 
in other action in businessrelated cases the court 
dealt a blow to some forms of affirmative action by striking 
down a program aimed at helping construction industry businesses 
owned by minorities voting 63 the court said the richmond va 
city council unconstitutionally discriminated against whites in 
saying a contractor on any city building contract must give at least 
30 percent of the value of the project to firms at least onehalf 
minority owned 
rejected an effort to preserve longshoremens jobs threatened by 
changing technology labor leaders warned that without the courts 
help strikes that have disrupted the industry for more than 20 years 
could resume 
refused to hear an appeal by atlantabased pest controller orkin 
exterminating co which had been ordered to roll back a fee increase 
it charged to more than 200000 customers nationwide it rejected 
arguments that orkin acted in good faith in hiking renewal fees to 
produce more than 75 million in extra revenue 
left intact a 125 million punitivedamages award won against 
an insurance company by an alabama man suffering from cataracts in 
both eyes rejecting without comment an appeal by nationwide mutual 
insurance co 
in its decision on the seabrook case the court cited the lack of 
a properly presented federal question and left intact a new 
hampshire law barring rate hikes to pay for nuclear plant 
construction before the facilities are completed 
though completed two years ago the seabrook plant has not yet 
received a federal license to operate 
the new hampshire supreme court last year upheld the state law 
denying higher rates to public service co of new hampshire which 
owns 35 percent of the seabrook plant through a subsidiary the 
state court said the utility was not entitled to a bailout 
other utilities in connecticut massachusetts vermont and new 
hampshire also are owners of the seabrook plant 
public service of new hampshire spent more than 177 billion to 
build the plant and the total project cost has been increasing at 
the rate of 50 milllion a month since completed in late 1986 
the utility filed for bankruptcy last january seeking court 
protection from its creditors the federal nuclear regulatory 
commission has refused to license seabrook to operate because the 
plant lacks an approved evacuation plan 
public service asked for an emergency rate increase of nearly 71 
million a year in 1987 plus other financial help 
the state supreme court upheld a new hampshire law that says 
at no time shall any utility rates or charges be based upon any 
costs associated with construction work if said construction work is 
not completed 
the state court said the law properly places the risk of building 
nuclear plants with investors rather that consumers 
the company is asking to shift the risk back to the 
ratepayer the state court said the company and its investors 
have eceived compensation for the risks they have assumed through an 
enhanced rate of return and here seek relief from those risks now 
that they have come to pass essentially the company seeks a 
bailout 
the creditors of public service joined the utility in urging the 
justices to overturn the state court ruling 
state officials were supported by new hampshires consumer 
advocate office in defending the state court decision 
the seabrook plant has had a troubled history besides delays and 
mounting costs it has encountered criticism from environmentalists 
and antinuclear activists opposition from the state of 
massachusetts has stymied development of the evacuation plan for the 
zone within 10 miles of the plant a zone that includes several 
massachusetts communities 
concerning advertisements by the legal profession the court had 
been expected to use a challenge to the california rule to issue a 
decision that would bind all the states 
but in a onesentence opinion the court said a los angeles 
lawyers appeal was being dropped for want of a properly presented 
federal question 
the justices in 1977 ended the legal professions longtime ban on 
all lawyer advertising but left it to the states to ensure that ads 
are not deceptive 
the court said 12 years ago that lawyer advertising like other 
commercial speech is not constitutionally protected if found to be 
false or misleading

automobile entrepreneur malcolm bricklin announced 
plans monday for a network of 1000 dealerships featuring glitzy 
hightech video booths that he says could make traditional showrooms 
obsolete 
were going to present to you in living color every single car 
in the whole world said bricklin who introduced japans subaru 
and the yugoslavian yugo to the american market eventually i 
dont see that many cars in a showroom anymore 
boasting that the ventures annual sales could reach 10 billion 
bricklin said he is lining up 10 megadealers who already own 
multiple automobile franchises for the core of bricklin motors 
the megadealers who will own between 2 percent and 4 percent of 
bricklin motors in turn would concentrate on quickly buying 
existing dealerships the group plans to pay cash for an 80 percent 
stake in each of the individual dealerships 
identities of the dealerships would remain the same with some 
reference to bricklin tacked on 
if we do what we plan on doing we should be in excess of 10 
billion in sales by this time next year bricklin said 
his proposed dealerships would feature a 10by10foot closing 
booth where prospective buyers would view a sound and light show 
that bricklin promised would be like no other in the automotive 
business 
if i can get people to come in and bring them something like an 
auto show and show them all the cars you will go out and see people 
that you know and recommend that they see the booth for no reason 
other than itself he said in a telephone interview from his ranch 
in meeker colo 
bricklin gave few other details of the booth but said it cost 1 
million to 15 million to develop after becoming fully 
operational bricklin said booths would cost about 50000 apiece 
he plans to bring his dealer plan and a halfsize scale model of 
the booth to the national automobile dealers association convention 
opening saturday in new orleans 
bricklin brought the japanese automaker subaru to the united 
states in 1968 and introduced the yugo here two years ago he sold 
his 70 percent stake in troubled yugo last may 
in the late 1960s he made an illfated attempt to market a 
gullwing sports car named the bricklin but the company went 
bankrupt after producing just a few cars after fiat pulled out of 
the united states in 1983 he formed a corporation to import two 
italian sports cars 
under bricklins new plan the 1000 dealerships that bricklin 
hopes to acquire in three years would be linked by satellite for 
daily sales meetings 
the dealerships also would have 24hour service departments with 
loaner or rental cars depending on what kind of service plan a 
consumer purchases 
robert arnold executive vice president of printon kane capital 
corp a new york investment banking firm advising bricklin said 
negotiations are under way with four dealerships interested in 
becoming part of the core arnold and bricklin declined to identify 
the dealers 
the business would be funded substantially by junk bonds or 
highyield bonds issued by companies with lessthaninvestment grade 
ratings arnold said

the dollar fell against most major currencies

bearish statement by a west german banking official 
the major european central banks the bank of canada and the us 
federal reserve cut off a dollar rally early in the new york trading

as usual the bank of japan stayed out of the action traders 
believe the japanese central bank is being reserved as the ultimate 
weapon in case massive centralbank action is needed to stabilize 
the dollar 
leonhard gleske a director of the west german bundesbank was 
reported to have said he would prefer to see the dollar fall below 
18 marks that statement was influential in driving the dollar

the central banks concerted action seems to have taken away some 
of the bullishness toward the dollar that prevailed for most of 
january said james pugh vice president for foreign exchange at 
bear stearns amp co

theyve got to the point where the dollar longs those bullish 
toward the dollar are scared pugh said

chicagos freewheeling futures traders are 
learning the hard way what wall street investment bankers have known 
for some time when the markets appear unable to police themselves 
the government steps in with tough measures ranging from grand jury 
subpoenas to fbi sting squads 
a massive federal probe into possibly widespread corruption in 
the chicago futures markets has raised key parallels to the insider 
trading crackdown that has tainted the new yorkbased securities 
industry for more than two years several lawyers and trading 
experts said monday 
one of the most important resemblances they said was the 
strongarm intervention of the justice department into areas that 
historically has been supervised largely by the business itself 
i think every so often youve got to shake up the system 
said howard schneider a former counsel to the commodity futures 
trading commission the federal regulatory body that oversees the 
futures pits this is a shakeup of the system hopefully the 
selfregulators will see this and do a better job 
the investigation of the chicago mercantile exchange and chicago 
board of trade which first surfaced last week included secret fbi 
plants disguised as floor traders who taped conversations of 
alleged wrongdoing 
at least 100 people were subpoenaed by the chicago us 
attorneys office in what has become the biggest fraud crackdown in 
the history of the wild chicago futures markets 
the use of stool pigeons surveillance and the threat of 
indictment and disgrace in the chicago probe in some ways echoes the 
tactics used in late 1986 to expose a massive insider trading scheme 
on wall street 
although it is too early to measure the outcome of the chicago 
investigation legal experts said the government appears to be 
relying on shock value secrecy and pressure on people to cooperate 
or face harsh penalties 
that is the same strategy used effectively by the manhattan us 
attorneys office to frighten many alleged wrongdoers notably the 
infamous speculator ivan boesky and the junk bond securities 
giant drexel burnham lambert inc to cooperate in the insider 
trading scandal 
the justice department wants to make a very strong statement 
not just about chicago and new york but about the credibility of 
the marketplace said jack barbanel a futures strategist at the 
new york investment firm gruntal amp co its a step beyond just 
leaving things with the sec and cftc 
at the same time the chicago and new york crackdowns show marked 
differences that perhaps reflect the intrinsic contrasts of the 
frenzied futures pits and the clubby more subtle relationships 
among stock traders 
for one thing the alleged frauds in chicago which included 
cheating customers and masking trading income reportedly were 
brazen acts committed on the exchange floors 
the new york scandal on the other hand involved crimes 
committed via clandestine arrangements and ferreted out afterward 
via exhaustive research work and papertrail hunting by sec lawyers 
and federal prosecutors 
the wall street stuff was the type of conduct you dont get 
eyewitnesses to said ira lee sorkin a former sec administrator 
who now practices securities law in new york 
securities cases and corruption cases are done secretly he 
said theyre not like bank robberies with fingerprints and 
bloodstains and getaway cars theyre done among only those engaged 
in the conduct 
another key difference in the new york and chicago scandals 
appears to be the level of market involvement in each probe 
the new york stock exchange provided information about many of 
the key trades that federal investigators have used to piece 
together their insider trading prosecutions in chicago market 
officials evidently knew little or nothing about the fbi probe in 
their midst until it was exposed last week 
theres no such thing as courtesy in law enforcement said 
michael feldberg a defense attorney and former federal prosecutor 
in manhattan why should they let the exchanges know when you 
have an undercover in place you try to get as much information as 
you can until the games over

futures prices for grains were mixed monday on the chicago board 
of trade as trading volume continues to be affected by the fbi probe 
of alleged fraud on the cbot and chicago mercantile exchange 
generally it has had some effect said tom gidel grains 
analyst with gh miller it has caused some confusion among 
traders 
wheat futures prices were supported by reports that the soviet 
union was bidding on 660000 tons of us export bonus wheat and 
that the philippines was seeking offers on 365000 tons of the 
commodity said gidel based in chicago 
heavy weekend rains in brazil and northern argentina helped 
improve the prospects of soybean crops there resulting in a 
negative mood in soybean trading said gidel 
wheat settled cent lower to 1 cents higher with the contract 
for delivery in march at 444 a bushel corn was 1 cent lower to 
2 cents higher with the contract for delivery in march at 270 a 
bushel oats were unchanged to 2 cents higher with march at 236 a 
bushel and soybeans were 5 cents higher to 4 cents lower with the 
march contract at 755 a bushel 
livestock and meat futures prices mostly retreated on the merc 
tom morgan president of sterling research corp of arlington 
heights ill said he also thinks the fbi probe has had some impact 
on trading lately 
its got to have a little impact the bigger traders are off 
looking for lawyers he said but overall it shouldnt have a 
big impact because the commercial houses do the bulk of the trading 
and they arent affected 
prices for frozen pork bellies were depressed by expectations of 
record supplies tuesday when the agriculture department delivers its 
cold storage report on dec 31 inventories 
steady to lower spot prices sent live hog prices lower said 
morgan while a weakness in wholesale prices and on the spot market 
lowered prices for cattle futures 
live cattle settled 43 cent lower to 05 cent higher with the 
february contract at 7252 cents a pound feeder cattle were 25 
cent to 42 cent lower with the contract for delivery in january at 
8372 cents a pound hogs were 05 cent to 53 cent lower with 
february at 4332 cents a pound and frozen pork bellies were 40 
cent to 200 cents lower with the february contract at 3940 cents 
a pound 
prices for copper futures rose toward record highs on the 
commodity exchange in new york 
the contract for march settled at 15070 a comex high for a 
nearby active copper contract said george anagnos a metals 
analyst in new york with thomson mckinnon securities inc 
the january contract was less than 8 cents shy of the spot record 
of 16475 
the copper market continued its rally despite increased 
inventories because demand remains quite strong and many traders 
have been concerned with mining problems in peru chile and zambia 
according to anagnos 
copper settled 13 cents to 29 cents higher with the contract 
for january at 157 a pound 
gold was slightly lower and silver higher on the commodity 
exchange in new york 
precious metals trading was basically influenced by the dollar 
and oil prices said anagnos 
for the fourth consecutive day international intervention 
against the dollar knocked the dollar down and made gold and silver 
prices steady to slightly higher he said but the extent of the 
rally was abbreviated by a drop in oil prices and its deflationary 
implications 
prices for precious metals usually move in the opposite direction 
of the dollar and inflation 
gold settled 70 cents to 80 cents lower with the contract for 
delivery in january at 40780 per troy ounce silver was 11 cents 
to 20 cents with the january contract at 619 a troy ounce 
petroleum futures prices were sharply lower on the new york 
mercantile exchange 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 66 cents to 106 lower 
with the contract for delivery in march at 1733 a barrel heating 
oil was 168 cents to 224 cents lower with the february contract 
at 5036 cents a gallon

political leaders called on the government 
monday to strengthen relations with foreign companies to exploit a 
giant crude oil discoveries in the amazon jungle and ease perus 
acute economic problems 
president alan garcia announced saturday that occidental 
petroleum corp had discovered an estimated 600 million barrels of 
oil in a remote area which if confirmed would more than double 
perus current proven reserves 
garcia valued the oil at 10 billion or more and said it would 
supply perus domestic needs and export requirements for 15 years 
gaston acurio of the opposition centerright party popular action 
said in a radio interview monday that the government must offer 
sufficient guarantees to foreign companies to ensure the oil does 
not remain below the ground 
garcias announcement came against a background of strained 
relations between the impoverished south american nation and foreign 
companies 
several foreign oil concerns operated in peru during the late 
1970s after oil was discovered in the amazon and oil became perus 
major foreign exchange earner 
since then political unrest and changing policies have 
frightened most foreign firms while restricting occidental and the 
state oil company petroperu from expanding production and 
exploration 
since garcia took office in mid1985 the government has 
nationalized a handful of foreign companies and taken other steps 
considered hostile to investment from abroad including limits on 
repayment of foreign loans 
occidental now is the only foreign oil company actively exploring 
oil production the government says 
officials did not comment monday on the possibility of financing 
perus estimated 19 billion foreign debt with potential income from 
the reported jungle oil find 
crude production has fallen during the decade from a high of 
nearly 200000 barrels a day to 140000 barrels slightly more than 
peru needs for domestic use 
former finance minister javier silva a senator from the centrist 
solidarity and democracy party charged garcia overestimated the oil 
discovery in an effort to divert attention from the nations 
problems 
i fear we are dealing once again with a smoke curtain to hide a 
grave internal situation marked by leftist guerrilla violence and an 
economic crisis he was quoted by the lima newspaper expreso as 
saying 
royal dutch shell oil company a year ago announced the discovery 
of natural gas in a jungle zone near the ucayali region estimated at 
7 trillion cubic feet the energy equivalent of 12 billion barrels 
of oil

a 30 million settlement has been reached 
in a lawsuit filed by computerland corp franchise operators against 
the company the nations largest franchised retail computer store 
chain it was announced on monday 
the settlement with the 800store company provides for a 
permanent contractual reduction in franchisee royalty rates to 5 
percent from 8 percent according to attorney norman stone who 
represented the plaintiffs in the class action suit 
computerland attorney edward keech said that broadly defined 
the class represents all present and former us franchisees 
the suit was initially filed in 1984 by michael belling and 
kenneth klein the former operators of computerland stores in marin 
county they alleged the company failed to ship them products 
leading to lost profits and eventually the loss of their stores 
a class action was filed a year later on behalf of all stores 
worldwide said ralph miller a spokesman for the plaintiffs he 
said the action was cut to only us store operators which meant 
about 500 people 
the suit also contended that computerland failed to pass on 
inventory and supplies at cost did not obtain the best prices 
available for franchisees benefit failed to pass on discounts to 
the stores and did not take favorable trade terms when offered by 
suppliers stone said 
the reduction in royalty rates represents a savings of 
approximately 234 million to member franchisees over the next 
three years alone he said 
as part of the settlement keech said computerland received a 
release from the plaintiffs giving up their right to sue the company 
the cash portion of the settlement comes from insurance funds 
said keech

lawyers for eastman kodak co asked a 
state judge monday to dismiss a 200 million environmental lawsuit 
filed against the company because the claims are too broad and vague 
the request came in a lawsuit filed last year in connection with 
the photo giants alleged chemical contamination of neighborhoods 
around its manufacturing complex known as kodak park 
state supreme court justice raymond cornelius reserved decision 
on the request 
if cornelius agrees with kodak the lawsuit comes to a quick end 
if he doesnt the lawsuit continues and kodak may be required to 
turn over records and submit its employees to lengthy legal 
depositions 
kodak attorneys claim that the lawsuit should be thrown out of 
court now because it seeks to represent a cumbersome and 
unmanageable group of people who have little in common and 
allowing the case to continue under those circumstances would be 
costly and timeconsuming to the company 
this the lawsuit couldnt be broader it couldnt be more 
diverse it couldnt claim more types of injuries argued michael 
wolford an attorney representing kodak 
the lawsuit filed on behalf of several former residents of a 
neighborhood near kodak park asks cornelius to grant the case 
classaction status so it can represent all the people who live and 
work or who have lived or worked within one mile of the companys 
sprawling factory 
wolford said that would include at least 75000 people 
however an attorney for those who filed the suit told cornelius 
that the only way to define the group of people affected by kodaks 
alleged chemical contamination is to allow the case to continue 
arnold levin representing the plaintiffs said he needs access 
to kodaks records and personnel to determine the scope of the group 
of plaintiffs

the people who have made the leveraged buyout one 
of the most popular avenues for financing blockbuster corporate 
acquisitions are being asked to explain to congress why their 
controversial methods should not be curtailed 
leveraged buyouts acquisitions made mainly with borrowed money 
that is repaid by the target company have made possible many of 
this countrys biggest corporate purchases such as the recent 
recordshattering 2453 billion buyout of rjr nabisco inc by 
kohlberg kravis roberts inc 
but critics of lbos contend the deals can cost jobs as new owners 
seek to cut costs at the suddenly debtburdened companies they also 
say taxpayers are helping finance lbos through tax breaks given to 
buyers and that the higher debt burdens raise the risk that the 
acquired companies will fail 
the criticism has increased over the past year partly because of 
publicity surrounding the rjr nabisco deal and other huge buyouts 
nine congressional committees plan hearings about lbos with the 
senate finance committee scheduled to hold the first session on 
tuesday 
some major lbo sponsors say the deals have not hurt the target 
companies or the taxpayer 
if you get someone who is trying to do a very good job of 
analyzing whats going on i think the analysis would lead you to 
conclude lbos are a net positive said joseph l rice a partner 
in the investment firm and lbo specialist clayton amp dubilier inc 
in a leveraged buyout investors borrow heavily to buy out a 
company and pay off the debt with the target companys cash flow or 
the sale of its assets including its divisions and subsidiaries to 
improve a companys cash flow acquirers may cut its costs and that 
can mean layoffs 
kohlberg kravis the undisputed leader in the field contends 
that a study it undertook to counter its critics indicates the 15 
firms it acquired through leveraged buyouts had a total employment 
increase of 37000 
rice said although an lbo business might be pared down by and 
large employment is either up or flat at companies clayton amp 
dubilier has acquired 
he also said leveraged buyouts provided opportunities for people 
who otherwise could not afford to buy a company and called the 
process the last great bastion for the entrepreneur in the united 
states today 
but critics say the heavy borrowing needed to create those 
opportunities put a company and its lenders in jeopardy buyouts 
often financed are with junk bonds higherrisk loans that pay a 
higher rate of interest 
critics point to revco ds inc the large ohiobased drugstore 
chain that went private in a 15 billion lbo in 1986 and last year 
filed for federal bankruptcy protection from its creditors after it 
failed to make a 46 million payment to junk bond holders 
cynthia latta an economist for data resources inc in lexington 
mass said the failure of lbo companies was a risk that could be 
realized if the economy slides into a recession and the companies no 
longer could generate the revenue to make their payments 
but rice said the higher debt levels of lbo companies generally 
have benefited stockholders and the economy 
if you take a look at buyouts over an extended period of time 
say for the last 20 years you would conclude the businesses that 
have been bought have used a very significant amount of debt in 
their capital structure he said many worldwide competitors 
have used debt for years and used it effectively 
opponents also want to rein in buyouts by amending the federal 
income tax laws which currently give an acquirer a deduction for 
all interest payments 
president bush said recently a review of the tax laws might be in 
order to curb any abuses but he would not advocate government 
action to put the brakes on takeovers 
the kohlberg kravis study contends the firms buyouts have not 
shortchanged the treasury and actually have added 2 billion to 
federal coffers while rice called buyouts a net taxproducer 
ms latta said the government did reap shortterm benefits from a 
leveraged buyout because stockholders tendering their shares to the 
acquirer paid capital gains taxes but the government may be losing 
out through longterm tax benefits to the acquirer she said 
if there were no longterm tax gains for the company they 
probably would not be doing it she said

the imprisoned expresident of the failed 
securities company bevill bresler amp schulman inc pleaded guilty 
monday to perjury for denying involvement in the fraud that led to 
the firms 144 million collapse 
gilbert c schulman 41 also admitted lying when he denied 
during two trials in april 1987 and july 1987 that he regularly 
received secret interest rate data from a board member of the new 
york federal reserve bank robert a rough 
assistant us attorney paul weissman said schulman would be 
called as a witness against rough at roughs trial on insider 
trading charges scheduled to begin feb 21 
schulman testified he and rough were friends for 15 years and 
talked regularly during 1982 to 1984 when rough served on the new 
york feds board as president of the national bank of sussex county 
in branchville but that no secret information was exchanged rough 
has pleaded innocent 
schulman admitted guilt at a hearing before us district judge 
dickinson r debevoise during which his attorneys asked for a 
reduction of his eightyear sentence for securities and tax fraud 
they suggested a total 30month sentence he has served 16 
months at the allenwood pa prison camp and five years 
probation including 2500 hours of community service at a soup 
kitchen 
debevoise refused slicing only two years off the sentence 
the judge recognized schulmans cooperation in the governments 
investigation of rough 
however i must say my cynicism does have some effect here 
he said he noted that schulman denied the charges in two trials 
the second resulting from a mistrial on some charges 
when that failed you turned over somebody to the government 
for prosecution debevoise said 
one of schulmans attorneys benson b weintraub said his client 
was the subject of harassment and ridicule by other inmates and 
staff at allenwood because of his cooperation 
he wears the jacket your honor of a snitch he said 
rough 49 was indicted dec 8 on charges that he leaked to 
bevill bresler secret data on the discount rate set by the federal 
reserve board in washington 
the discount rate has a bearing on the securities market and the 
indictment said bevill bresler made millions of dollars and avoided 
losses on the basis of the information in exchange rough allegedly 
received 47000 in interestdeferred loans 
the brokerage house collapsed in april 1985 four executives who 
pleaded guilty and cooperated with prosecutors were subsequently 
imprisoned for charges stemming from the collapse

amoco corp monday reported a 2 million decline in its 
fourthquarter income saying gains in refining operations were 
offset by low energy prices 
two other oil companies atlantic richfield co and ashland oil 
inc both reported doubledigit increases in aftertax earnings for 
the same 1988 period 
amoco based in chicago said its earnings totaled 375 million 
in the three months ended dec 31 or 145 a share on revenue of 
62 billion that compared with earnings of 377 million or 147 
a share in the corresponding 1987 quarter when revenue came to 59 
billion 
for all of last year earnings were 206 billion or 801 a 
share up 52 percent from the previous years 136 billion or 
531 a share revenue for the year was 2393 billion up from 
2246 billion in 1987 amoco said 
richard morrow amocos chairman and chief executive said the 
company showed good profit margins for the fourth quarter due to 
high customer demand for chemical products and gains in 
transportation operations 
chemical results benefited from continued high levels of 
customer demand which resulted in strong margins for most product 
lines morrow said in a statement 
but those gains were offset by a drop in earnings from 
exploration and production operations because of lower worldwide 
energy prices he said 
last years overall earnings growth reflected record profits from 
refining marketing and transportation operations and chemical 
business 
los angelesbased arco said its net income totaled 391 million 
or 222 a share up 15 percent from 340 million or 186 a share 
in the fourth 1987 quarter fourthquarter revenue was 455 
billion down from 462 billion a year earlier 
arco said it earned 158 billion or 878 a share in all of 
1988 up from 122 billion or 668 a share the previous year 
sales were 1832 billion up from 1698 billion in 1987 
we were extremely pleased with our strong performance in 1988 
which was achieved despite a continuing decline in crude prices 
said lodwrick cook arcos chairman and chief executive officer 
the primary earnings contributors were our downstream 
operations 
ashland said its firstquarter earnings for the threemonth 
period ended dec 31 rose 20 percent to 96 million or 172 a 
share from 80 million or 141 a share in the yearearlier 
quarter revenue totaled 21 billion up slightly from 2 billion 
the previous years earnings reflected a gain of 40 million or 
71 cents a share from the adoption of a required tax accounting 
adjustment the latest periods figures reflected an aftertax gain 
of 18 million or 33 cents a share the ashland kybased company 
said 
ashland chairman john hall said strong refinery margins in 
october and november substantially boosted the earnings of the 
companys ashland petroleum subsidiary its superamerica and ashland 
chemical units also turned in strong performances while its 
engineering and construction operations had a disappointing quarter 
he said 
although the recent rapid increase in crude oil prices has 
caused refinery margins to decline to marginally profitable levels 
which is typical for this time of year we remain optimistic that 
1989 will be another good year for ashland hall said

the diversified manufacturer said it earned 272 million or 
121 a share in the quarter ended dec 31 up from 216 million

of 1058 billion 122 percent higher than 1987s 942 billion 
the company said 
allen f jacobson chairman and chief executive officer said 
improved overseas sales contributed to the record year in addition 
more than 30 percent of sales in 1988 came from products introduced 
within the last five years he said 
our earnings now have increased nearly 75 percent in the last 
three years jacobson said in a statement sales are up 35 
percent over the same period 
jacobson said 3m also increased research and development spending 
10 percent to 689 million or 65 percent of sales 
the company benefited from a lower tax rate and weaker dollar 
jacobson said the lower price of the dollar in overseas sales 
contributed an estimated 46 million or 20 cents a share to 1988 
earnings he said 
we look for economic growth to moderate and inflation to 
accelerate slightly jacobson said in addition strengthening 
of the us dollar could result in slightly negative currency 
effects

a federal judge monday took under advisement a 
motion by two unions to dismiss a lawsuit in which texas air and 
eastern airlines ask damages of 25 billion 
miami ap a federal judge monday took under advisement a 
motion by two unions to dismiss a lawsuit in which texas air corp 
and its subsidiary eastern airlines ask damages of 25 billion 
us district judge william m hoeveler said he is inclined to 
dismiss complaints against 38 officers and directors in the two 
unions the complaints are part of the suit 
this is subject to whatever else i might decide in this case 
hoeveler said 
the suit by eastern and texas air was filed in may 1988 under a 
civil racketeering rico statute alleging mail and wire fraud and 
extortion under the federal hobbs act against the air line pilots 
association and the international association of machinists district 
100 aflcio 
the suit charges rico and rico conspiracy through a pattern of 
criminal activities and defamation of eastern airlines and texas 
air 
during three hours of argument before hoeveler attorneys for the 
unions attacked the suit at two levels 
joseph guerrieri jr of washington dc an attorney for the 
machinists told hoeveler the suit should have been filed as a 
counterclaim to a suit filed in 1987 in washington by the unions 
against the airlines 
that suit now before us district judge barrington parker in 
the district of columbia alleged that texas air was dismantling 
eastern to destroy its unions 
parker c folse iii of houston representing texas air responded 
that the issue before the district of columbia court is entirely 
different from the issue before this court folse added that 
access to documents and witnesses is much more convenient in this 
district 
but most of the argument came concerning the issues advanced in 
the suit charging the unions with violation of the racketeering act 
representing the air line pilots association attorney jed rakoff 
of new york said the miami suit if successful would set back 
labor law by a century it would hold that legitimate union activity 
constituted a crime 
richard ruda an attorney for the machinists said the case 
involves a classic labor dispute he said the suit was filed 
just to keep the unions in line it is a blatant misuse of the 
rico act 
representing the air line pilots association thomasina williams 
said the acts charged against the union were all protected and 
were not extortionate conduct 
in answer to the individual arguments folse representing texas 
air and eastern said the complaint is supported by various 
activities by the union but he said the labor attorneys confuse 
legal issues with social and political issues 
at another point folse said they were furious at texas air 
acquiring eal they wanted to acquire it they told eal we 
want to own your route your passengers if you dont sell it to 
us were going to run you into the ground 
david ross a miami attorney also representing texas air said 
some of the statements made by union employees attacking easterns 
safety procedures are actionable under law 
the suit claims compensatory damages of 500 million and asks 
that the amount be tripled under the racketeering act the suit also 
asks 1 billion in punitive damages

federal banking regulations to protect against 
discrimination in home mortgage lending are being pervasively 
disregarded a practice that has led to a nationwide pattern of 
discrimination against blacks and hispanics a congressional critic 
charged monday 
it is painfully clear that the federal regulatory agencies have 
not used their legal authority to ensure that every american citizen 
has equal opportunity to secure credit in order to own a home 
said rep joseph p kennedy ii dmass 
kennedy joined by house banking committee chairman henry b 
gonzalez dtexas pointed to data from the federal home loan bank 
board obtained by the atlanta journalconstitution under the 
freedom of information act and published in sundays editions 
statistics from 10 million loan applications from 1983 to 
mid1988 showed the rate of rejection for white applicants at the 
3100 savings and loans nationwide was 111 percent while the 
rejection rate for blacks was 237 percent and 182 percent for 
hispanics in boston the rejection rate for whites was 91 percent 
but 265 percent for blacks 
industry officials say the data does not prove racial 
discrimination because it does not take into account applicants 
income debt burdens credit histories and other information that 
impact on mortgage lending 
while it does signal that the regulators ought to look at this 
it does not really show evidence of discrimination itself said 
mark clark of the us league of savings institutions 
kennedy conceded there could be factors other than race that 
account for the rejection rate differences but added i dont 
believe anybody with reasonable judgment would come to that 
conclusion 
the congressman a member of the house banking committee 
disclosed the justice department has had the raw data plus an 
institutionbyinstitution breakdown for two years but has taken no 
legal action kennedy called for prosecution under the equal credit 
opportunity act the fair housing act and the community reinvestment 
act 
those who overtly discriminate should be prosecuted and the 
financial institutions who tolerate a racially biased lending 
program should be exposed and punished under the law he said 
justice department spokesman mark weaver said prosecutors 
received the raw data from the home loan bank board two years ago 
but that the investigation was put on the back burner because 
prosecutors were unable to make sense of the computerized statistics 
im told that the tape was of absolutely no use to us weaver 
said they spent a lot of time working with our computer experts 
and speaking with people at the home loan bank board the numbers 
werent making sense faced with a large amount of raw data that 
was not in a coherent format that project was put on hold 
weaver who stressed the inquiry was initiated by the justice 
department as part of routine monitoring said prosecutors 
reopened the mortgage discrimination investigation in july following 
stories in the journalconstitution but the probe is limited to 
atlantaarea lending institutions he declined comment on the 
possibility of a nationwide investigation in light of the new 
information 
kennedy and gonzalez attacked the home loan bank board for not 
taking action on what the congressmen said were clear patterns of 
discrimination and they criticized the other federal bank 
regulating agencies for failing to keep such statistics altogether 
we do not accuse the federal regulators of bigotry or racial 
bias but discrimination is an insidious evil and we must be active 
and vigilant in our efforts to fight against it kennedy said 
passive tolerance of discrimination is just as harmful in its 
effect as outright bias 
david barr a spokesman for the home loan bank board said an 
agency official is analyzing the data in the wake of the 
journalconstitution story 
told of the congressional criticism that the agency should have 
analyzed the information on its own spotted the differences in 
races and taken action barr said that could be a valid point 
but you could also say that about some other statistical information 
that the bank board is not analyzing he cited a lack of resources 
to do such analyses 
gonzalez endorsed and vowed to push through a kennedydrafted 
bill that would require commercial banks and mortgage companies in 
addition to savings and loans to report mortgage applications and 
rejections by racial categories it also would extend race 
disclosures to commercial loans for small businesses 
in addition the legislation would require the regulatory 
agencies to analyze the data and make it public the home loan bank 
board collects the racebased information but has never analyzed 
it that was done by the newspaper 
those who have nothing to hide have nothing to fear from this 
legislation kennedy said at a news conference but those who 
deny credit on the basis of race or national orgin had better watch 
out
