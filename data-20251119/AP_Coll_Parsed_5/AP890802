saudi arabia on wednesday denounced both 
the israeli kidnapping of a shiite moslem cleric and the killing of 
us marine lt col william r higgins 
the official saudi press agency quoted a responsible source 
as saying riyadh always condemns and denounces terrorist acts of 
all forms and of whatever methods these are despicable inhuman 
acts 
arab media criticized israel for abducting sheik abdul karim 
obeid from south lebanon friday and urged the united states to show 
restraint amid reports of us fleet movements in the mediterranean 
the dubaibased albayan wrote in an editorial israel has 
flung the doors of hell wide open 
what is the objective behind the israeli act which can only be 
classified as organized state terrorism asked abu dhabis 
staterun alittihad daily 
the hardline newspaper alkhaleej in neighboring sharjah 
emirate said the zionist terrorist operation in south lebanon 
and its repercussions must be attributed to us policy in the 
region and the full and unconditional us bias toward israel 
the kuwait newspaper alrai alaam cautioned the united states 
against a military response to higgins purported hanging 
the united states does not possess many effective means for a 
speedy revenge of the hanging of a marine colonel by a group 
operating in a country with usurped sovereignty such as lebanon 
an effective military action is impossible in a country 
overburdened with rocket launchers artillery tanks bombs 
boobytrapped cars and suicide squads which could be mobilized in 
any reaction to an american retaliatory strike it wrote 
omans leading alwatan newspaper said blame should be pinned 
on israel as it is the instrument of violence in the region 
alwatan and other persian gulf newspapers urged selfrestraint 
in the crisis 
the newspapers noted that an arab league committee announced an 
impasse in efforts to end lebanons 14yearold civil war 
the qatar newspaper alraya said that israel could exploit the 
situation to direct a major blow against lebanon that could 
lead to its partition into small states after 
internationalization of its crisis 
syria voiced surprise and outrage at claims of higgins 
death but blamed israel for abducting obeid and refusing to free 
him israel offered to exchange obeid and shiite moslem prisoners 
it holds for three israeli servicemen and all 16 foreign hostages 
in lebanon 
egypt a us ally and at peace with israel urged all parties 
concerned whether regional or international to exercise extreme 
selfrestraint

an exsheriffs deputy held his former 
girlfriend hostage in a courtroom for nearly seven hours tuesday 
then killed himself and her authorities said 
officials and bystanders heard two muffled shots at 945 pm 
from the courtroom where manny cabano seized juanita hermosilla a 
county clerk who had obtained a restraining order against cabano 
the day before 
paramedics and sheriffs authorities then rushed in and found 
cabano dead with a gunshot wound to the head and ms hermosilla 
critically wounded 
ms hermosilla was taken to john peter smith hospital in fort 
worth where she died at 1017 pm while undergoing emergency 
surgery said eric gordon night administrator both victims were 
in their 40s 
cabano used a 44caliber pistol hed taken to the courtroom in 
the suicidemurder said tarrant county sheriff capt tony wise 
cabano had also seized a 38caliber pistol from the justice of the 
peace in whose courtroom ms hermosilla worked 
the gunman apparently went to ms hermosillas home and opened 
her mail finding court papers relating to the restraining order 
before storming the courtroom sheriffs officials said 
the standoff began when cabano grabbed the woman in justice of 
the peace robert ashmores firstfloor courtroom at the tarrant 
county courthouse at about 3 pm 
police negotiated with cabano sometimes through ms hermosilla 
via telephone during the standoff wise said talks with cabano were 
improving about 8 pm and authorities thought the situation would 
end without bloodshed 
our hopes were building he said 
but then ms hermosilla came on the line and she requested 
that she talk to her boys thats always a bad sign 
wise didnt say whether ms hermosilla was able to speak to her 
children 
police special weapons and tactics units were dispatched to the 
scene but left about 5 pm when the sheriffs department said 
they would take over said fort worth police spokesman doug clarke 
judge ashmore said he worked with the man and knew him the 
sheriff said he worked with him and knew him clarke said 
a sheriffs department dispatcher who did not wish to be 
identified said cabano worked here as a deputy years and years 
ago he then became a bail bondsman until he went bankrupt about a 
year ago 
four of ms hermosillas five children some in their teens 
rushed to the courthouse about 5 pm but were taken away by 
several of her coworkers 
police blocked off the area and evacuated about 300 people in

this northwestern minnesota town with 250 
students is challenging larger districts in the state to top its 
attendance record and graduation rate 
rothsay in fact is willing to give 500 in scholarship money 
to the first three districts that can top its accomplishments the 
challenge is aimed at districts with more than 4000 students 
weve been listening to things like bigger is better 
said tom fosse a school board member and president of the rothsay 
community development corp which is providing the money were 
saying maybe thats not true 
rothsay is issuing the challenge in response to a legislative 
auditors report issued in december saying some of the states 
smallest school districts are not providing students with a good 
education and should be phased out 
when you read the report it just sounds like were doing such 
a terrible job with our young folks said duwayne balken 
chairman of the school board we believe thats not true at all 
theyre very well prepared 
school districts accepting the challenge must meet or exceed 
rothsays record in average daily attendance and graduation rates 
over the last three school years 
the challenge also includes the rate of extracurricular 
participation the percentage of high school graduates who entered 
a postsecondary school and the percentage that earned degrees from 
a fouryear institution all during the last three years 
school officials are confident even though they havent checked 
numbers to see how rothsay has fared in those categories 
we know theyre high fosse said were confident that 
well stack up well were waiting for a challenge

prime minister margaret thatcher has angered 
powerful political associates with a cabinet shuffle that 
humiliated her longtime foreign secretary 
it was not so much what she did on july 24 when 13 of the 22 
cabinet posts changed hands that has upset the hierarchy of the 
usually welldisciplined conservative party 
it was her manner of doing it that left wounds and resentments 
which some analysts believe could mark the beginning of 
thatchers political end 
many of us found what went on nauseating tory legislator 
david howell chairman of the house of commons foreign affairs 
committee said in a television interview 
he spoke after news broke of how mrs thatcher moved aside sir 
geoffrey howe britains longestserving foreign secretary since 
world war ii and replaced him with a virtual unknown john major 
in the process according to howes aides mrs thatcher offered 
howe another senior but less prestigious job as home secretary 
without consulting the incumbent douglas hurd 
howe 62 turned that post down as a demotion after six years as 
foreign secretary he settled for what mrs thatchers office 
called the courtesy title of deputy prime minister and the job 
of government leader in the house of commons 
howe also accepted residence in a country mansion dorneywood 
which currently is used as a weekend retreat by the third member of 
mrs thatchers top cabinet trio chancellor of the exchequer nigel 
lawson 
this is how regimes behave when they have begun to take power 
for granted commented london sunday times columnist robert 
harris 
off the record government ministers were quoted as complaining 
that mrs thatcher who has held office for 10 years committed a 
major blunder by humiliating or affronting all three of her top 
cabinet colleagues 
some described the shakeup by mrs thatcher who has sole power 
to appoint cabinet ministers from among her partys legislators 
as a shambles and said it reflected her increasing lack of 
regard for the cabinet 
mrs thatchers downing street office took the unusual step of 
announcing she supported hurd and would have kept him in an 
unspecified top job had howe taken the job of home secretary 
in the announcement mrs thatcher also said there will be no 
more cabinet shakeups before the next general election which must 
be held by mid1992 but could come earlier 
howe who was cheered by sympathizers when he entered the 
commons after the shuffle hastily denied a newspaper report that 
he planned to run against mrs thatcher for the party leadership 
hurd announced that the cabinet was united lawson known to 
disagree with mrs thatcher on aspects of economic policy said 
nothing 
the thatcher cabinet is now more divided than ever before 
not on policy but on personality either they are for mrs 
thatcher or they are against mrs thatcher wrote columnist alan 
cochrane in the proconservative mail on sunday newspaper 
she is lucky the long summer recess is now upon us but the 
summer wont last forever and the contenders for her job wont 
bide their time forever he said 
a senior aide to mrs thatcher hinted that howe was removed 
because he and lawson pressed the prime minister to be more 
conciliatory about european monetary union before junes meeting of 
european economic community leaders in madrid 
at the summit she agreed in principle to link the pound to 
other european currencies 
but a dip in opinion poll ratings of the conservative government 
that began in march has turned into a persistent deficit of about 
10 points behind the opposition labor party 
furor over the cabinet shuffle has heightened fears that mrs 
thatcher may be an electoral liability 
with a batch of unpopular legislation due next year including 
the sale of water and electricity industries to private enterprise 
conservative fears are growing that labor cant be stopped this 
side of an election

an army officer and 12 policemen 
have gone on trial for murder in an unprecedented prosecution 
initiated by parents of two boys shot to death in 1985 by officers 
hidden in crates on an unmarked truck 
the parents decided last year to pursue the case on their own 
after the attorney general for cape province declined to prosecute 
the policemen despite a magistrates finding of police negligence 
the trial that opened tuesday in cape town supreme court is 
reportedly the first murder case to proceed under a law allowing 
private citizens to press a prosecution in certain instances where 
the government has declined 
the 1985 confrontation which occurred during antiapartheid 
unrest in a mixedrace township near cape town has become widely 
known as the trojan horse incident because white police gunmen 
concealed themselves in a what looked like an ordinary delivery 
truck 
footage of the incident was shown at the time on television news 
broadcasts in the united states and britain 
according to evidence at the inquest an army commandant and two 
senior police officers ordered the truck into the township of 
athlone expecting it to be a target for stonethrowers 
gunfire from the concealed policemen killed shaun magmoed 16 
michael miranda 11 and jonathan classens 21 but the magistrate 
ruled there was no evidence that any of the three were among a 
handful of mixedrace youths who did throw stones 
the officers in the crates popped out of the hiding places and 
fired 39 rounds of shotgun ammunition at the crowd according to 
the evidence 
the private prosecution was instituted by mirandas mother and 
magmoeds father their lawyers are to be paid with proceeds from a 
fund set up last year which has received contributions from various 
overseas human rights organizations 
defense lawyers are being paid with public funds 
the law providing for private prosecutions allows the defense to 
ask that the prosecutors pay the defendants entire legal costs if 
the case ends in acquittal 
at the start of tuesdays proceedings defense lawyers asked 
that the prosecution be ordered immediately to post a deposit of 
360000 to cover possible legal costs the request was taken under 
consideration by the judge

eddie murphy thinks he got a raw deal from 
paramount and a bum rap from spike lee 
given my personal circumstances and the success of my films 
ive got the worst deal in hollywood murphy said in the aug 8 
issue of rolling stone magazine 
he was upset by jack nicholsons potential 60 million payday 
for batman a payoff based on a percentage of the receipts and 
merchandising rather than the perfilm deal that murphy signed with 
paramount pictures 
when i renegotiated my deal with paramount a few years ago it 
seemed great said murphy but nobody planned that my pictures 
would be as successful as they are so now ive got a lousy deal 
compared with what i could be making 
murphy also said he was angered by fellow filmmaker lees 
charges that he has failed to use his power to help other blacks in 
hollywood 
i do have a social conscience but i cant walk into a 
studios front office and demand hire some black people here 
spike gets overanxious playing that militantbrother role and 
occasionally says some stupid stuff murphy said

mike rutherford says the music and 
message of his solo group mike and the mechanics is becoming more 
defined and is distinctly different from genesis the pop group he 
helped found 
i feel that with each album im getting away from genesis 
said rutherford theres a lot of influences that are coming 
through the mechanics that havent completely gotten out yet we 
are always changing 
although both groups have a top 40 sound rutherford sees 
differences i think onstage we go a little more rhythm and 
blues and thats one of the things that takes us away from 
genesis he said 
he believes it is unfair to compare the 12yearold genesis and 
his veteran bandmates phil collins and tony banks to the 4yearold 
mechanics but rutherford said it is inevitable 
despite the good fortune the mechanics have experienced the 
group still struggles while genesis lives in the comfort that they 
have fans to buy their records and attend their concerts 
on one hand i can fly around the world with genesis and with 
the mechanics i cant make any mistakes said rutherford

a raffle offering a complete wedding and 
reception package drew no takers among public housing residents in 
this ohio river city 
it was my bright idea that maybe we would have some young lady 
who rather than living with a fellow would like to get married 
and did not have the means evansville housing authority board 
member jeanette benton said tuesday 
the package including gown tuxedo flowers for the wedding 
party and the traditional decor were to be given away monday in a 
raffle for more than 1000 people living in homes owned by the 
housing authority 
residents could obtain free tickets by filling out a form that 
verified they were single no one picked up a ticket a 
disappointed benton said 
benton who owns and operates a wedding outfitting business got 
the idea for the wedding after learning of mass weddings put on by 
larger cities federal housing programs 
such weddings in other cities were motivated by housing 
officials who wanted to stop couples from living together as a way 
of circumventing a federal requirement of reporting all household 
members incomes 
benton reiterated that was not her motivation adding it was 
just something to give back to the community

a mississippi businessman was the paid 
informant who in 1964 led the fbi to the graves of three slain 
civil rights workers according to records of a defunct 
segregationist state agency 
olen burrage of philadelphia miss received 30000 from the 
fbi for this information records from the sovereignty commission 
show the records quote their own informant 
burrage however denied that he had anything to do with the 
killings 
a federal judge last week ordered the records of the commission 
which tried to thwart civil rights groups in the 1950s and 1960s 
be opened to the public the judge later stayed his ruling pending 
an appeal 
portions of the records are included in the personal papers of 
former gov paul b johnson jr the complete records are in the 
archives of the mccain graduate library at the university of 
southern mississippi in hattiesburg portions were made available 
to the clarionledger in an agreement with the attorney general 
burrage told the newspaper monday that he had nothing to do with 
the killings of james chaney andrew goodman and michael schwerner 
he also denied that the fbi paid him for information 
burrages attorney robert thomas of philadelphia said his 
client was tried on federal charges of conspiracy to violate the 
civil rights of the three men in 1967 and acquitted 
hey look you can write whatever you want to burrage said 
in a telephone interview with the jackson clarionledger i 
didnt have nothing to do with it im not going to have anything 
to do with it now 
ive been harassed for years and years on this mess i dont 
even want to talk to you about it he said 
commission investigator al hopkins search for the fbi 
informant is contained in the commissions records hopkins is dead 
hopkins wrote a report on his investigation aug 6 1964 two 
days after the three bodies were found in a grave at the base of a 
pond dam under construction on burrages land southwest of 
philadelphia 
i have information from a confidential source that mr 
olen burrage a white male who owns the property where the bodies 
were found and who operates a truck line out of philadelphia 
mississippi is the informant who directed the fbi to the spot 
hopkins said in the report 
joe sullivan who was the fbi agent in charge of the neshoba 
county investigation said monday that burrage never received money 
for information 
i didnt pay any money to anybody sullivan said in an 
interview from his new york city home i certainly dont know 
anything about it 
sullivan said a freelance writer working on the case during the 
44 days federal and state officials looked for the three had 
offered a reward of 25000 for information leading to the bodies 
that was the genesis of all the talk up there sullivan 
said i think he was affluent enough he could have paid the 
reward 
the fbi file shows an informant led agents to the dam but 
sullivan refused to identify the individual i have never named 
anybody and i dont want to 
the commission was created by the mississippi legislature on 
march 22 1956 to preserve segregation in the state the 
commission became inactive in 1973 when thengov bill waller 
vetoed its funding the legislature abolished the commission and 
ordered its files sealed for 50 years in 1977

since east germany was founded 40 
years ago west germanys largest publishing chain has snubbed its 
socialist sibling by placing quotation marks around every reference 
to the state 
but starting today axel springer newspapers and magazines will 
end the practice that has irked authorities in east berlin 
springer officials said 
the quotation marks have cost the publishing empire journalistic 
accreditation in the neighboring socialist state and readership 
among much of west germanys leftleaning populace 
but far from conceding defeat in the ideological battle the 
publishers contend the war against the division of germany 
continues 
the hope for reunification is unshaken manfred schell 
editorinchief of the conservative daily die welt wrote today 
but in light of changes in eastwest relations the barriers to 
improving the flow of information between the political blocs must 
fall schell said 
the giant springer publishing network includes europes 
largestcirculation daily hamburgbased bild zeitung which sells 
nearly 5 million copies daily it also includes the influential 
berliner morgenpost and bonns die welt 
despite springers broad audience its journalists have been 
denied accreditation to work in east germany on the grounds that 
the companys editorial policies are insulting to the berlin 
government 
a spokesman for the east german foreign ministry said the 
government had no immediate comment on springers reversal 
schell hinted in his editorial that the newspaper considered the 
dropped quotation marks a step toward gaining permission to report 
from east germany referring to east germany as ddr the german 
abbreviation for deutsche demokratische republik was the protest 
of the publishing chains founder axel springer who died nearly 
four years ago 
germanys division after world war ii weighed heavily on 
springer who moved his prospering business from his native hamburg 
to west berlin in 1967 
after construction of the berlin wall in 1961 he put up a 
lighted readerboard to flash news from the west across the barrier 
springer also issued political and moral guidelines for the 
publications in 1967 and the first and foremost called for the 
reunification of germany 
from the 1949 founding of east germany springer publications 
refused to acknowledge the socialist government and the quotation 
marks demonstrated their disdain 
die welt administrative chief jens lueddeke said other west 
german publications also initially declined to acknowledge east 
german statehood using similar quote marks or skeptical references 
to the government 
but most dropped the practice after west germany recognized the 
east in 1970 
springer editors concede now that the quotation marks have now 
lost their meaning and in some cases simply confuse readers 
circulation of springers main dailies has fallen by as much as 
10 percent over the past few years and many attribute the drop to 
shifts within the west german populace toward detente with nations 
of the sovietled warsaw pact 
the number of people who can recall adult life in a unified 
germany is a minority die welt editor schell wrote 
with this step we come to grips with the developments in east 
and central europe in particular the reform efforts in hungary 
poland and the soviet union schell said

working women sleep about 25 minutes 
less per night than their male counterparts though the average 
woman sleeps slightly longer than the average man researchers said 
tuesday 
working women really take it in the neck they sleep less 
said daniel hamermesh professor of economics at michigan state 
university and one of the authors 
one possible explanation is that a woman who works still has 
to maintain a lot of household duties said jeff biddle 
assistant professor of economics at the school 
they arent spending much less time doing those things and 
their husbands arent sharing chores with them so the time has to 
come from somewhere and often it comes from sleep time 
mothers of children less than 3 years old get less sleep than 
the average person but being parents to children younger than 3 
doesnt cut into the amount of sleep fathers get hamermesh said 
the study of the sleep habits of 1500 people also found that 
people who work sleep less than people who dont work and that for 
every extra hour worked a person sleeps 15 minutes less 
the more a man works the less sleep he gets the report said 
men who earn a higher wage per hour sleep less than lowerpaid 
men but that pattern fails to hold up for women 
one reason may be that women who are already working are 
sleeping less already and so the margin is gone he said 
hamermesh and biddle gleaned the findings from reviewing 
information gathered in 197576 by the university of michigan 
survey research division in 198081 620 members of the study 
group were interviewed again 
biddle said the time lapse since the data was collected 
shouldnt matter because lifestyles havent changed significantly 
since then 
lifestyles and attitudes toward money and family are pretty 
much the same things like household habits are very slow to 
change he said 
wide variances in the amount of time people sleep were turned up 
by the study hamermesh said 10 percent reported sleeping less than 
65 hours a night and 10 percent reported sleeping more than 9 
hours 
sleep is not something biologically fixed people can 
substitute other activities for sleep hamermesh said 
although its true we do need a certain amount of sleep we do 
have some control biddle said how much time is valued is 
going to enter into that decision

the justice department is weighing whether 
william lucas could be named chief civil rights enforcer on an 
interim basis after his rejection by the democratdominated senate 
judiciary committee 
the idea was raised by senate minority leader bob dole rkan 
on tuesday after lucas defeat in a pair of 77 votes that attorney 
general dick thornburgh labeled raw politics 
a spokesman said thornburgh is studying whether lucas could be 
given a recess appointment to the job after congress scheduled 
adjournment friday 
however one white house official said president bush likely 
would not want to anger congress so early in his term by defying 
the senate over lucas who was criticized by opponents as being 
unqualified to become assistant attorney general for civil rights 
no new names for the position are under consideration while the 
legality of the recess appointment option is being explored said 
robert s ross jr thornburghs executive assistant 
ross said thornburgh and his top aides were surprised by the 
committees action saying they expected the nomination would be 
forwarded to the full senate where they thought lucas would win 
confirmation 
a recess appointment would let lucas serve until the term of the 
current congress expires in 1990 the final decision on whether 
to go that route would be up to bush 
sen joseph r biden jr ddel judiciary committee chairman 
called the notion of a recess appointment a bad idea 
congressional and white house sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity said a recess appointment would touch off a 
confrontation between bush and congress 
in terms of where we go from here were now exploring our 
options said presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater who 
expressed disappointment over the vote fitzwater said he did not 
know whether dole discussed the idea of a recess appointment with 
the white house 
no decisions have been made however about either mr lucas 
future or how we might approach the job at the justice 
department he said 
seven of the judiciary committees eight democratic members 
voted against lucas citing his lack of professional qualifications 
to head the justice departments civil rights division 
sen dennis deconcini dariz joined the panels six gop 
members in voting for lucas 
the committee also rejected on an identical vote a motion by 
sen strom thurmond rsc to send lucas nomination to the full 
senate without a committee recommendation 
opponents argue that lucas 61 a black detroit republican who 
was sheriff and later chief executive of wayne county mich 
showed during his confirmation hearing that he was not familiar 
with civil rights law 
lucas who has never tried a court case acknowledged during the 
hearing that he was new to the law 
hes lacking in experience and qualifications his managerial 
accomplishments are debatable said sen howell heflin dala 
who cast a crucial vote against confirmation 
but republicans accused democrats of racial hypocrisy by 
refusing to give lucas a chance to gain experience in the job 
by rejecting him we are preaching one civil rights philosophy 
and practicing another said sen charles grassley riowa 
noting that lucas would bring to the job his experience as a victim 
of racial discrimination 
but biden retorted that the greatest injustice is being done 
to bill lucas because of what i think is the apparent cynicism of 
this administration 
bill lucas adds up to a perfect foil biden said a 
decent honorable black man who has had a successful career who 
has demonstrated he knows absolutely nothing about the law i think 
that is cynicism in the extreme

the bush administration is planning a fall 
offensive to call attention to the chronically low us savings 
rate with officials holding out the possibility that thrifty 
americans will be rewarded with increased tax incentives 
treasury secretary nicholas brady aides said will kick off the 
campaign with a series of speeches outlining the risks to americas 
global competitive position from low savings rates which drive up 
the cost of capital for us businesses 
the personal savings rate savings as a percent of aftertax 
income fell to a 40year low of 32 percent in 1987 and increased 
only slightly to 42 percent last year 
by contrast the savings rate in japan was 165 percent in 1987 
the administration is looking at a variety of possible solutions 
to the problem ranging from broadening the tax savings offered by 
individual retirement accounts to eliminating the double taxation 
on corporate dividends 
the trouble is that such proposals to offer tax breaks to people 
who save would mean a tax loss of billions of dollars when the 
federal government is already straining to reduce huge budget 
deficits 
but officials said it was likely that the administration would 
offer some changes in us tax law for congress to consider 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan testifying tuesday 
before the senate banking committee called boosting the low us 
savings rate the crucial issue for the longterm economic outlook 
of the country 
economists have long warned that the low personal savings rates 
combined with the large federal budget deficits were driving up 
interest rates in the united states and making it more expensive 
for us businesses to borrow money needed to expand and modernize 
greenspan as he has done in the past urged congress to make 
reducing the federal budget deficit a top priority but he said 
lawmakers should also consider ways to boost personal savings to 
expand the pool of available capital 
the fed chairman noted that between the civil war and world war 
i america had the highest savings rate in the world which helped 
supply the capital needed to transform the country into an 
industrial giant 
while the personal savings rate had rebounded somewhat to 55 
percent during the first six months of this year greenspan said 
more must be done to push the rate higher 
greenspan said officials at the federal reserve the treasury 
department and the presidents council of economic advisers were 
studying a variety of legislative proposals to boost savings 
including the possibility of making changes in financial markets 
that would favor savers 
treasury undersecretary robert r glauber said in an interview 
that the administration had a task force reviewing the savings 
issue and that one option being considered was revamping ira 
accounts which were scaled back in the 1986 tax law 
also being studied glauber said are ways to eliminate the tax 
code inequity that makes it cheaper for corporations to borrow to 
finance expansions than to issue stock 
if a corporation raises capital by borrowing it can deduct its 
interest payments but if it sells stock and distributes dividends 
on its profits both it and the shareholders are taxed on those 
profits 
glauber said brady would frame the issue in a series of speeches 
this fall as part of an overall need in america to focus more on 
longterm goals he said the administrations push for a reduction 
in the capital gains rate would be included as one of the changes 
needed to lower the cost of capital to businesses 
these are issues on which the secretary feels very strongly 
glauber said he is going to map out an agenda in some detail and 
with some coherence 
in a preview of the initiative two weeks ago white house budget 
director richard darman called in a speech for both public and 
private belttightening to cut budget deficits increase 
productivity improve the education system and make other necessary 
sacrifices to adequately address the future

a federal judge who was reprimanded for ruling 
on two general electric co cases while owning ge stock said he 
will institute safeguards to prevent it from happening again 
a judicial panel determined that us district judge thomas 
curran violated the us judicial code of ethics by ruling in the 
cases according to documents obtained tuesday by the associated 
press 
the code requires judges to disqualify themselves from any case 
in which they have a personal or financial interest 
in a letter william j bauer chief judge of the us 7th 
circuit court of appeals admonished curran to increase your 
diligence in searching out any future possible conflicts but said 
no other action would be taken 
because the violation unintended as it appears gives an 
appearance of impropriety to the actions we express our concern 
that they occurred said bauer who oversees the milwaukee 
district where curran presides 
curran could have faced suspension or a recommendation that he 
be impeached but bauer said those penalties would have been too 
harsh 
currans rulings in the cases where he had holdings were 
reported by the ap on may 30 that report triggered the 7th circuit 
review 
the judicial council is made up of the 11 active appeals judges 
in the 7th circuit and four district judges from the 7th circuit 
which covers indiana illinois and wisconsin 
upon being notified of the conflict curran publicly dismissed 
himself from the cases an action that allows interested parties to 
reopen the cases 
in a letter responding to the reprimand curran said he joined 
in the councils concern about the conflicts and instituted 
additional procedures and safeguards designed to prevent 
reoccurrence 
curran wrote he reviewed documents in both cases and i simply 
never connected up the defendant in each case with my investment 
the responsibility and blame must rest solely on my shoulders 
the ap discovered the conflicts by reviewing currans annual 
financial disclosure statements and crossreferencing his stock 
holdings with his case files 
the ap review showed curran has reported each year since 1985 
that he has held between 15000 and 50000 in ge stock he 
presided over unrelated cases involving ge medical systems in 1987 
and 1989 in both cases he ruled in favor of ge 
in the eastern district of wisconsin based in milwaukee lawyers 
are required to file a certificate identifying all interests in the 
case judges must then review that certificate and compare it 
against their financial records to make sure they do not have an 
interest 
in one of the two ge medical systems cases curran said a 
certificate of interest was not filed by either the defendant or 
plaintiff 
curran 64 was appointed to the bench in 1983 by former 
president reagan his 1988 disclosure statement showed net 
investments between 648030 and 1740000 generally in bluechip 
stocks his investments returned between 37147 and 112116 in 
1988 including between 1001 and 2500 in ge dividends

for jim wright veteran speaker of the house 
it was his tryout to be speaker with a small s 
wright who resigned from congress two months ago under an 
ethics cloud found himself sharing billing tuesday night with a 
comic juggler a magician jack bennys daughter and a professional 
cat trainer 
such are the perils for the texas democrat who after a few 
weeks of rest from the trauma of his resignation is setting out on 
the lecture trail 
wrights first stop was the annual convention of the 
international platform association an organization of program 
organizers and talent bookers who arrange speakers and 
entertainment for colleges corporations and trade groups 
ipa officials describe their forum as similar to the national 
basketball association draft where the best talent is shown off 
and shopped around to an outside observer it more resembles a 
meat market 
speakers at the convention in a downtown washington hotel all 
have the same idea says ipa chairman dan tyler moore 
they have something to say and they want to be paid a buck 
for saying it 
wrights message was a simple one the honor of politics as a 
profession and of congress where he served for 34 years in 
particular 
the 25minute talk was punctuated with anecdotes about life on 
capitol hill including wrights account of his wellmeaning 
attempt to help a wouldbe texas bride get a 48hour leave for her 
serviceman fiance so the two could be married 
he received a telegram of effusive thanks from the woman and 
one from the groom that said why dont you mind your own damn 
business 
the ipa after sitting through days of speeches and acts is a 
tough audience 
several of the professional critics said wright needed to punch 
up his routine a bit perhaps adopting a more controversial topic 
others said he was better than expected for a politician 
i think hed be popular said fred antil of cornell 
university hes got insight into something we are all curious 
about he had good emotion use of quotations range 
but richard l mellott of lorain county community college near 
cleveland ohio said hed be reluctant to book wright because of 
the ethics controversy that forced him from office 
hes going to be like ollie north hell be big in the 
corporate world and the redneck world where they wave the american 
flag a lot mellot said 
another veteran conventioneer said wright will be good for a 
few months because hes still sort of a hot item but it wont take 
long for the star to fade 
wright said his asking price will be 10000 a speech near the 
bottom of the range for top speakers these days but five times the 
maximum he was allowed to accept for a speech while a member of 
congress 
former president reagan is getting upwards of 50000 per 
appearance and north convicted in the irancontra scandal is 
paid a reported 25000 per speech 
wright said his goal in starting a new career as a public 
speaker is to help people understand congress a little bit better 
and to awaken an interest in young people in public service 
id like to overcome to the degree possible the cynicism 
that exists 
wright resigned after the house ethics committee charged him 
with 69 ethics violations including allegedly using bulk sales of 
his book to evade limits on outside income and improperly taking 
gifts from a developer friend who had a direct interest in 
legislation wright contended he was innocent of the charges

an energy department report on the 
governments nuclear weapons program describes a pattern of shoddy 
waste management and hazardous conditions with contamination of 
ground water or soil at many plants 
the findings were included in a detailed assessment tuesday on 
what it will take to clean up the nuclear weapons plants after 
decades of environmental neglect by plant operators 
energy secretary james watkins said the first phase of the 
cleanup effort will cost 195 billion over the next five years 
with the overall cleanup likely to take at least 30 years overall 
cost estimates range from 90 billion to as much as 150 billion 
the departments report listed numerous cases where shoddy 
handling of hazardous waste has contaminated ground water posing 
various degrees of risk to surrounding communities 
for example according to the report 
at the oak ridge reservation in tennessee surface and ground 
water contamination was blamed on abandoned waste storage tanks 
some public surface water was found to be contaminated and further 
potential health risks exist 
soil and ground water was found contaminated at the savannah 
river uranium processing plant near aiken sc where wastes are 
buried in unlined pits and lagoons some of the contaminated 
wastewater has been discharged into streams 
uranium dust has contaminated water at the idaho national 
engineering laboratory where spent nuclear fuel is recycled the 
report also warned of an immediate risk to employees through 
exposure to contaminated drinking water and said radiation 
exposure is a potential health risk to nearby property 
ground water also was cited at the hanford nuclear reservation 
in eastern washington state where particular concern was noted 
because of the facilitys proximity to the columbia river 
among other priorities was reducing ground water contamination 
at the lawrence livermore national laboratory at livermore calif 
and digging up barrels of liquid chemical waste at the nevada test 
site north of las vegas 
the report said ground water contaminants must be reduced at 
other federal nuclear facilities including the welden springs 
nuclear site in missouri the fernald uranium processing plant in 
ohio the rocky flats plutonium processing plant in colorado and 
the los alamos national laboratory in new mexico 
at los alamos untreated liquid were sometimes discharged 
into canyons and radioactive wastes stored in various pits 
trenches and shafts as yet the health risk of those actions 
cannot be quantified the report said 
watkins outlined the departments proposed cleanup effort in a 
speech tuesday to the national press club 
he acknowledged the cost will be high and said even an 
optimistic timetable passes much of the burden to the next 
generation 
the plan which must be approved by congress calls for spending 
24 billion next fiscal year after that the annual bill is 
expected to steadily increase peaking at more than 4 billion in 
both fiscal 1994 and 1995 
the money would be used to clean up pollution where federal and 
state safety laws are violated repair faulty equipment and develop 
new procedures and technology for future waste disposal the 
department said 
most of the 195 billion will be used at 17 nuclear weapons 
plants in a dozen states as well as other nuclear facilities most 
of which are inactive but continue to have hazardous waste problems 
among the sites considered most contaminated and getting the 
largest share of the cleanup money are the hanford nuclear complex 
in washington state 4 billion the savannah river facility near 
aiken sc 34 billion the oak ridge reservation complex in 
tennessee more than 27 billion and the idaho national energy 
laboratory nearly 22 billion 
meanwhile environmental protection agency officials jonathan z 
cannon and richard e sanderson criticized the plan saying it 
provides for tradeoffs among compliancerelated activities 
rather than a commitment to doing everything necessary to clean up 
the plants

the new chairman of the national governors 
association said he will press the states chief executives to 
reach a consensus for change on education and the environment 
iowa gov terry branstad outlined his goals at the end of a 
fourday meeting of the nations governors tuesday that produced 
few disagreements and a date to meet again late next month with 
president bush for a domestic summit on education 
reflecting the quiet harmony of the conference the governors 
unanimously approved a resolution urging congress and the president 
to impose a twoyear moratorium on expansions in the medicaid 
program that states would be required to finance 
it also asks congress and the bush administration to consider 
restructuring the entire health care system including 
federalization of medicaid states and the federal government 
currently share medicaid costs with the program administered by 
the individual states 
branstad a republican who was named to a oneyear term as 
chairman to replace democrat gerald baliles of virginia said he 
would make the environment and education the focus of coming 
meetings of governors 
we cannot accept a future of declines in education and 
degradation of the environment branstad said governors can be 
the facilitators to bring about a consensus for change 
branstad said south carolina gov carroll campbell a 
republican and arkansas gov bill clinton a democrat will head 
the governors preparations for the education meeting with bush no 
site has been selected 
several governors voiced support for expanding health care 
coverage to more poor americans but said federal requirements that 
states pay for it were consuming their budgets 
we dont think its fair for congress to take credit for doing 
things and then submit the bill to the states and say you raise 
taxes to do it branstad said we think the people that are 
going to be requiring things to happen also ought to show how its 
going to be paid for thats responsible 
central to the governors complaint is their argument that 
actions by congress requiring expanded medicaid coverage for more 
people and for wider types of health care have forced states to pay 
most or all of the costs 
the governors said that if current growth in medicaid continues 
spending by all states on the program will grow from 41 billion in 
1986 to 104 billion by 1994 medicaid under these projections 
will have grown from 6 percent of total state budgets to nearly 16 
percent by that date 
all these are worthwhile programs but if we let this trend 
continue were not going to have a budget to deal with said 
democratic gov james blanchard of michigan 
the governors approved a series of other policy statements few 
generating debate among them was a cautiously worded one urging 
the federal government to reduce the deficit without raising taxes 
if possible while protecting key domestic spending and 
imposing a selective spending freeze in line with bush 
administration policy 
meeting in private the democratic governors association 
elected ohio gov richard celeste as its new president when 
clintons term ends in january 
the full governors conference elected democrat booth gardner of 
washington as vice chairman putting him in line to follow branstad 
as chairman next year

average farm profits showed a modest increase 
last year despite the drought but fewer farms posted profits 
according to a new study by the department of agriculture 
farmers depending on crop sales as a major source of farm 
income who incurred expenses for production and later were left 
with complete crop failure or severely reduced yields had lower 
profits or greater losses the report said 
livestock producers within droughtplagued areas also were 
hurt mostly by higher feed costs according to the report issued 
this week at the opposite extreme producers managing to harvest 
crops or having large inventories benefited from higher market 
prices 
according to the usda study the average net farm income 
increased by about 350 to 21300 last year marking a 15 
percent increase over 1987 
average net farm income profits rose in 1988 despite the 
drought the report said however the share of farms with 
negative income increased slightly from that of 1987 
the usda credited higher earnings from crop and livestock sales 
for raising gross farm income despite lower direct government 
payments more loan redemptions from the commodity credit corp 
and fewer net additions to crop and livestock inventories 
average expenses also rose but not enough to override the 
expansion in gross farm income 
fewer farms were profitable in 1988 than 1987 the report said 
noting that three out of four farms represented in the farm costs 
and returns survey were profitable last year 
more than half of all farms 53 percent had positive net cash 
farm income in 1988 which was identical to that of 1986 but down 4 
percentage points from that of 1987 the report said 
cash income in 1988 averaged 17400 up 500 from 1987 
net farm income measures the longer term earnings of a farm 
business and is the difference between gross farm income and total 
expenses over time this income measure shows the farms ability 
to survive as a viable business 
net cash farm income measures the shortterm cash earnings of a 
business and does not account for capital consumed in the 
production process it shows whether the farm is covering all cash 
costs such as interest income taxes and principal payments 
the report said fewer farms had relatively high levels of debt 
compared with assets with 48 percent showing no outstanding 
liabilities at the end of 1988 that figure was 395 percent in 
1984 
higher asset values thanks to increases in land values and 
coupled with continuing efforts by farmers to avoid debt financing 
and reduce current debt lives have resulted in a stronger solvency 
position for farmers the report said

a cubanborn conservative easily won the republican 
nomination for the house seat of the late claude pepper and looked 
forward to building up her campaign war chest while two democrats 
face a tough runoff 
i think the bloody fight is going to be between the democrats 
were sailing on said state sen ileana roslehtinen who won 85 
percent of the gop primary vote tuesday against three opponents in 
a bid to become the first cubanamerican in congress 
meanwhile prominent attorney gerald richman claimed momentum 
heading into the aug 15 democratic runoff as he edged rosario 
kennedy also cubanborn jo ann pepper niece of the liberal 
champion of the poor and elderly who had represented the diverse 
district since 1962 finished third 
the richmankennedy runoff promised to add ethnic rivalry to the 
heated competition for the district which includes the heavily 
cubanamerican little havana area 
my whole theme has been to unite the community richman 
said this should be an american seat with people voting for the 
most qualified candidate 
i am a cubanamerican said ms kennedy a former city 
commissioner im also a woman and i have represented all of the 
people of the city of miami 
in unofficial returns from all 146 precincts ms roslehtinen 
36 had 16952 votes or 83 percent fellow cubanamerican carlos 
perez 57 had 2261 votes or 11 percent insurance broker david 
fleischer 54 had 698 votes 3 percent and evangelist john 
stembridge 51 had 571 votes or 3 percent 
in the democratic race richman 48 had 5853 votes or 28 
percent while ms kennedy 44 had 5707 votes or 27 percent ms 
pepper 39 had 5097 votes or 24 percent four other candidates 
ran well behind 
richman who is jewish hoped to pick up the support of ms 
pepper who carried predominantly black precincts richman 
dominated in predominantly jewish miami beach and ms kennedy won 
strong support in hispanic precincts 
the elections office said the districts 100198 registered 
democrats comprised 16028 hispanics 32183 blacks and 51987 
nonlatin whites the 71620 registered republicans comprised 
46738 hispanics 23656 nonlatin whites and 1226 blacks 
the figures for hispanics count only those born in hispanic 
nations unofficial estimates that include secondgeneration 
hispanics run to about half of the registered voters 
richman was angered by ms kennedys mailings that attacked him 
for representing arms dealer sarkis soghanalian indicted on 
charges of illegally conspiring to smuggle combat helicopters to 
iraq richman called soghanalian a patriot who has helped us 
causes 
there has been some nasty negative campaigning that had me 
extremely upset he said but he added that his campaign which 
started low in the polls clearly has gained the momentum 
ms kennedy said she wasnt worried about richmans late rush 
saying the former florida bar association president outspent her at 
the end on television and radio 
republicans were delighted at the nomination of ms 
roslehtinen an educator who is married to us attorney dexter 
lehtinen 
im particularly grateful that the primary campaign was one 
that did not open wounds among republicans said guy vander jagt 
chairman of the national republican congressional committee 
ms roslehtinen will get help from a fundraising visit today 
by vice president dan quayle for the state republican party she 
led candidates in primary fundraising with more than 200000

the democratic chairman of a house agriculture 
subcommittee describes the governments cancellation of some farm 
export projects as an overreaction saying the program has been 
handled like a covert operation 
its almost operated like a defense department operation 
rep dan glickman dkan said about the export enhancement 
program i dont want a stealth eep 
the agriculture department citing congressional leaks of 
sensitive information said tuesday that all projects approved but 
not announced under the eep have been canceled 
a list of proposals that had been approved but not announced 
was made public by members of congress yesterday monday in a 
hearing this information is market sensitive and was not 
authorized for release richard crowder undersecretary for the 
usdas international affairs and commodity programs said in a 
statement 
the export subsidy program has operated since 1985 to make us 
commodities competitive in targeted markets where foreign 
competitors especially the european economic community intrude 
with subsidized sales of their own 
about 65 countries including the soviet union and china have 
been designated for subsidized sales 
under the program private exporters can sell us commodities 
at lower prices to meet foreign competition and then collect free 
government surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses or 
subsidies 
the agriculture department and the general accounting office 
the investigative arm of congress told a house agriculture 
subcommittee monday that the program has succeeded in boosting farm 
exports 
in response to questions by subcommittee members the gao gave 
the panel a list of export subsidy proposals some of which had not 
been announced 
the list which was classified could enable foreign competitors 
to seek out the intended buyers of us goods overseas and offer 
better deals an official said 
if information is released prior to the announcement of a 
decision then the effectiveness of the program dissipates and the 
ultimate cost is borne by us farmers by making it more difficult 
to compete in markets abroad crowder said 
glickman chairman of the subcommittee said in an interview 
that the gao voluntarily handed over the document to us it 
became a public document 
he is overreacting glickman said of crowder hes also 
inexperienced but he is an honest decent guy 
glickman who said he planned to meet friday with crowder sent 
a letter acknowledging that the incident was unfortunate and 
shouldnt have happended 
rep david nagle diowa said the incident began when he asked 
crowder if the soviet union was interested in buying soybean oil 
from the united states crowder said he didnt know and asked the 
gao which led to the distribution of the sheets that included 
rejected projects 
obviously he crowder doesnt want this list out nagle 
said they dont want to admit they havent been taking advantage 
of sales opportunities and have been rejecting programs 
nagle said the papers showed rejections to the dominican 
republic for 200000 tons of wheat venezuela for 700000 tons of 
wheat brazil for 500000 tons of wheat and to israel for 16000 
tons of rice 
but rep bill emerson rmo an agriculture committee member 
who was not at mondays hearing blamed nagle and said the 
agriculture department had no choice but to cancel the eep projects 
it is hard to quarrel with what they have done because it 
could have adverse effects on the market he said it is 
incumbent on the members to be a little more sensitive to tossing 
this information around

foreign ministers hoping to clear a path to peace 
in cambodia went home after a ringing round of speeches leaving 
deputies to hack through almost impenetrable underbrush 
even if four disparate cambodia factions reach an accord 
allowing internationally supervised steps toward reconstruction 
good intention must stand the test of political reality 
a lot of delegates express optimism but i dont think very 
many of them are optimistic a japanese official said before a 
month of committee work began tuesday 
the crucial obstacle is what to do about the khmer rouge no 
mere negotiating point to any cambodian who left his family on the 
killing fields 
frontpage cartoons in the paris daily le monde keep fresh the 
memory of pol pots regime of the 1970s in which at least 300000 
people were executed or starved in class purges 
tuesdays drawing showed one cambodian telling others i 
propose we forget our little differences they sat at a table 
engulfed by a vast sea of skulls 
khmer rouge leader khieu samphan sat impassively in the hall 
taking his turn at the rostrum to denounce subsequent vietnamese 
crimes in cambodia as equal to adolf hitlers 
speaker after speaker rejected any khmer rouge role in 
cambodias longterm future but aides acknowledged privately it 
was not likely the khmer rouge would go away 
even us secretary of state james a baker iii endorsed khmer 
rouge participation in a transitory coalition regarding that as a 
necessary evil to remove vietnam from the scene 
vietnams role was another imponderable 
vietnamese authorities pledged to evacuate their last troops by 
sept 27 whatever the 19nation paris conference decided in 
monthlong deliberations 
will the vietnamese really get out even if they remove their 
troops reflected lek hor tan a cambodian historian who helps 
edit the londonbased index on censorship i dont believe it we 
have jungles sanctuaries 
other expert observers disagreed with lek vietnams lingering 
presence would be noted endangering its basic purpose of improving 
its international image and attracting more aid 
vietnam foreign minister nguyen co thach assured goodwill 
mugging for reporters in a surreal counterpoint to the grim 
business at hand 
he said his chinese colleague was cordial modifying beijings 
harsh tone toward vietnam we shook hands he said did we 
look at each other and go like this he closed his eyes and stuck 
out his tongue no no 
prince norodom sihanouk occupied a pivotal role at the 
conference as he has since his neutralist government crumbled two 
decades ago after the vietnam war spilled across his borders 
flitting between china and france he has rallied support for 
his embattled nation held together by a rich ancient culture that 
has absorbed and then shrugged off foreign intrusion throughout 
history 
still his popularity is not boundless many cambodians remember 
his reign as tainted by profligate relatives of the colorful prince 
who they say played the saxophone while cambodia burned 
some cambodian experts see a likely compromise if any is 
forged will be a symbolic role for sihanouk under a government 
sympathetic to vietnam with the khmer rouge making war at the edges 
as the conference shifted into grinding low gear western and 
cambodian analysts agreed that one of the few concrete results was 
a backhand byproduct 
in the past few months hun sen the cambodian prime minister 
who was widely spurned as a puppet of hanoi has been tacitly 
legitimatized as leader of cambodia 
he is in a position to hold power while waiting for support to 
wane for sihanouk and for son sann a prowestern resistance leader 
in tenuous control of his forces 
despite the obstacles most of the world is anxious to press for 
some sort of settlement 
the united states and the soviet union see it as a costly 
dangerous flashpoint in a world with enough problems japan wants 
to rebuild cambodia but cannot without a stable internal framework 
and the six members of the association of southeast asian 
nations have been trying for a decade to get vietnam to go home and 
allow the cambodians to find some level of coexistence 
outside nations hope a thaw in phnom penh will melt away 
settlements of 300000 refugees along the thai border not only a 
human tragedy but also a political tinderbox 
beyond the internal issues at the heart of the cambodian 
problem nations differ over the international structure to 
supervise the peace some insist that cambodians should resolve 
their own problems at their own pace 
canadian foreign minister joe clark among others argued that 
the international effort has to be part of a comprehensive 
settlement including agreement among the cambodians there has 
to be a peace to keep he said 
he added what many cambodian experts considered to be a 
understatement this will be the most complex peacekeeping 
operation since the congo

hungary says it is risking social 
unrest rising unemployment and a possible backlash from the 
conservative right in its push toward a freemarket economy 
the government in a memo tuesday to a 24nation conference on 
aid to poland and hungary said it is determined to change its 
statecontrolled economy even if it initially causes social 
conflicts 
hungary warned however of widespread opposition if its 
campaign resulted in a sharp and sustained fall in the standard of 
living of the countrys 11 million people 
it urged more than 130 officials attending the meeting at the 
headquarters of the european community for financial aid hungarys 
foreign debt is about 18 billion the highest per capita in 
eastern europe 
the memo said the government was seeking as much as 3 billion 
in new western assistance from 1990 to 1992 
president bush and other key world leaders called for the 
meeting to draw up a western aid package that would encourage 
democratic change and economic reforms in poland and hungary 
they also urged emergency food shipments for poland 
at the oneday talks the united states pledged an additional 
50 million in food aid to poland beginning oct 1 to help ease 
the shortages caused by that governments moves toward a 
freemarket economy 
were trying to help carry them through this period curtis 
kamman deputy assistant us secretary of state for european 
affairs told reporters 
austria and switzerland also promised food aid the european 
community the 12nation trading bloc earlier agreed to send 120 
million worth of meat grains and other products to poland 
shortly after bushs trip last month to warsaw the united 
states announced it would send 9 million in food from surplus 
stocks 
poland on tuesday ended price controls and meat rationing as 
part of the current economic reforms there was concern the abrupt 
lifting of price controls might send the country into turmoil 
hungary a founding member of the warsaw pact has been in the 
forefront of economic reforms in the communist bloc since the 
1960s the push has recently accelerated 
the governments memo said the key goal was for hungary to 
become an equal member of the community of the developed 
democratic nations 
to do so it wants to create a market economy based on the 
equality of the different forms of ownership and integrated in 
the world economy with a currency that can be traded 
internationally 
hungarys currency like those of other east bloc nations does 
not circulate in world currency markets 
parallel with our efforts aimed at creation of the market 
economy economic policy must also be radically changed the memo 
said 
the reforms it said require tight monetary and budget policies 
that can lead to poor economic growth and higher inflation 
hungary said its balance of payments a summing up of 
international trade payments was expected to deteriorate in 
1989 moreover it forecast a higher jobless rate due partly to 
shutdowns of moneylosing companies 
although unemployment is not yet considerable its rate is 
gradually growing it said cautioning it could lead to serious 
problems in certain regions 
it invited the nations attending the aid conference to meet in 
budapest next month to take a closer look at hungarys situation 
nations at the meeting were the european community members of 
britain ireland norway denmark belgium the netherlands 
luxembourg germany france spain italy and portugal 
others present were the united states canada australia 
turkey new zealand japan sweden switzerland finland austria 
norway and iceland

congress must share the responsibility in the 
battle against aids by appropriating money for all the programs it 
says must be implemented a federal health official says 
dr james o mason assistant secretary for health at the 
department of health and human services said congress often fails 
to provide additional money to pay for programs it authorizes 
we have been getting very clear guidance except when we get an 
authorization without an appropriation mason told a house 
oversight subcommittee grilling him tuesday about spending on aids 
treatment 
it would be helpful if you folks would provide leadership 
shot back rep ted weiss dny chairman of the subcommittee 
rep nancy pelosi dcalif said the department wont get a 
larger share of limited federal funds unless the department is 
going to squeak a lot louder 
weiss and pelosi represent the two cities new york and san 
francisco with the largest aids populations 
mason who headed the centers for disease control in atlanta 
before being selected by bush for the no 2 hhs job said he shares 
responsibility for the entire public health service budget which 
includes the cdc national institutes of health and the food and 
drug administration 
what is enough for aids he asked rhetorically we cant 
drop infant mortality or cancer we could drop any other of these 
and do more on aids but i dont think that is what the nation wants 
us to do 
moreover he said there are problems even within the aids 
appropriations provided by congress 
for example mason said congress authorized 15 million last 
fall to help pay for azt administered to patients who couldnt 
afford it during the current fiscal year azt which costs several 
thousand dollars a year per patient is the only approved drug 
treatment for aids 
however the authorization didnt carry with it a new 
appropriation to replace the appropriation that had been used up 
leaving hhs officials with the choice of ignoring congress 
directive to continue paying for the drug or dipping into other 
aids budget accounts to come up with the 15 million 
mason said he was facing the same problem that his predecessor 
did because the hhs budget approved by the house appropriations 
committee contains about 16 billion for aids but nothing to 
specifically cover the 30 million authorized for azt payments 
during the fiscal year that starts oct 1 
the only place i can find that is to take it out of prevention 
or biomedical research mason said someone has to make a 
priority decision 
the human resources and intergovernmental relations subcommittee 
of the house committee on government operations which held 
tuesdays hearing doesnt have jurisdiction of legislation either 
authorizing hhs programs or appropriating money for them

drug czar william j bennetts national drug 
strategy calls for increased law enforcement but is short on 
specifics according to administration officials who have seen it 
while the program focuses on cocaine particularly crack it has 
virtually nothing on heroin dangerous prescription drugs that 
are diverted to illegal use or hallucinogens said one source 
theres only one sentence on all of that the source said 
tuesday 
the strategy report to the cabinet required by the 1988 
antidrug law that created the office of national drug control 
strategy strongly reflects public comments made by bennett since 
he took office five months ago 
the final report is due sept 5 
it reads like one of his speeches said one source 
another source said bennett wrote the strategy himself after 
gathering information from government agencies and drug experts 
all the sources spoke on condition of anonymity 
the strategy calls for an allout effort to eradicate domestic 
marijuana crops and to wipe out moneylaundering operations but it 
says nothing about domestic methamphetamine labs one source said 
however the source said there were few specific goals such as 
the number of drugtreatment beds the nation should have by 1991 
in the draft submitted monday 
the only goals included were that drugrelated admissions to 
emergency rooms and the drug use found by the national household 
survey on drug abuse should be reduced by 10 percent in two years 
and by 50 percent in 10 years according to one of the sources 
bennett warned last week that the strategy would contain some 
carrots and some sticks 
we will expect states to do certain things if they want 
federal funds he said then we will expect educational 
institutions to finally do certain things if they want education 
funds 
in the most recent draft those threats take the form of a 
possible loss of highway funds for states that fail to revoke 
drivers licenses from those convicted of drug offenses and a 
possible loss of federal education funds from schools that fail to 
have education department approved drugprevention programs and 
policies a source said 
threats in an earlier draft to revoke criminal justice funds 
were eliminated the source said 
senate judiciary chairman joseph r biden jr who spent eight 
years pushing for creation of the job said during bennetts 
confirmation hearing that he expected the strategy to include 
detailed goals 
one source said bennett planned to meet with senators in the 
next few days possibly to reduce expectations 
the strategy seen by the sources did not include matters such as 
international operations and interdiction efforts which are 
included in a separate classified document being reviewed by the 
national security council 
the nonclassified strategy under review by the domestic policy 
council reflects bennetts oftstated contention that the drug war 
must be aggressively fought on all fronts enforcement prevention 
and treatment 
no single strategy pursued alone or to the detriment of other 
possible and valuable initiatives can work to contain or reduce 
drug use the strategy says 
but what that means in terms of money was not immediately clear 
the draft strategy circulated monday included no budget figures 
bennett said in june that he expected to seek more money for 
drug treatment and probably more for prevention he said last week 
that the escalating cost of the drug war may eventually lead to the 
need for a tax increase 
the strategy stresses a need to rid inner cities of illegal 
drugs 
a paramount target of lawenforcement activity especially at 
the local level must be the disruption of those street markets for 
drugs in which retail demand and supply finally meet in a 
combustible mix 
it includes proposed antidrug legislation for states that 
closely resembles outlines bennett provided two weeks ago to a 
gathering of state legislators according to one source 
the policies bennett urged on the state legislators ranged from 
hiring more police judges and prosecutors and building more 
prisons to imposing civil fines of up to 10000 for those 
convicted of possessing small amounts of drugs

point or 0003 percent ending at 3489934 after it surpassed the

dealers attributed the indexs fall from the 35000 mark to 
profittaking and directionless afternoon trading 
in currency dealings the dollar in tokyo opened sharply lower 
following its plunges on overseas markets overnight traders said 
minori takeuchi a dealer with chemical bank in tokyo said 
dealings in tokyo were mixed with selling for position adjustment 
and buying by foreign investors who will sell it later when the 
dollar goes up 
the dollar has been falling as market players became reluctant 
to buy it because of the us federal reserve boards move to relax 
monetary policy she said but its no longer a strong 
marketaffecting incentive because its already been taken for 
granted 
ms takeuchi said the dollar is unlikely to fall further 
because investors are no longer selling it only based on the us 
interest rate cuts and relaxation of monetary policy

congress is being warned not to bet the farm 
on highdefinition television 
despite what its proponents say about the dazzling new 
technology hdtv wont play a significant role in a growing 
electronics market in the next 20 years according to a 
congressional budget office report tuesday 
the report which may take some of the wind out of the hdtv 
sails in congress said 
hdtv advocates have made very optimistic forecasts about 
the market size and easy availability of the next generation of 
video 
even under the rosiest of scenarios hdtv sales will be small 
relative to other electronic equipment markets 
it is questionable how quickly or if finicky consumers will 
accept hdtv even though it promises 35mm motion picture quality 
images particularly if there are intermediate and cheaper types of 
advanced tv receivers available 
the total world market for electronic equipment grew by 54 
billion in 1988 to reach 461 billion and the world market for 
hdtv receivers and vcrs is forecast to be less than 30 billion by 
2010 
hdtv will spur only marginal production of sophisticated memory 
chips which are widely used in other applications even now 
it seems counterintuitive to suggest that such a small market 
that may exist in the future is a more important driver of 
economies of scale technology and competitive success than is the 
growth in the present market the report said 
it would be a case of the tail wagging the dog 
but the report written by philip c webre said government 
support of hdtv might be justified because of increased employment 
national prestige or scientific advancement 
the report was introduced at a hearing of the senate 
governmental affairs committee which is considering a possible 
government role in fostering the growth of a us highdefinition 
tv industry 
proponents say a quick government decision is vital in 
overcoming the japanese and european lead in the hdtv arena 
committee chairman john glenn dohio said the united states 
needs to preempt foreign competition so hdtv wont become another 
usinvented product that is sold back to americans from overseas 
despite the report the hdtv juggernaut rolled along tuesday on 
several congressional fronts 
the senate commerce science and transportation committee gave 
voice vote approval to a 305 million authorization bill for the 
commerce departments new technology administration in fiscal 1990 
that includes 375 million for federal hdtv research and seed 
money for private hdtv consortia 
the bill was amended to allow foreign companies to participate 
in the hdtv research consortia and a provision for 50 million in 
loan guarantees was dropped 
also a house science space and technology subcommittee 
approved an amendment to the technology authorization bill to 
provide 100 million annually for three years for creating 
publicprivate consortia for hdtv development 
peter mccloskey president of the electronic industries 
association applauded the cbo report saying it would help shift 
the discussion of us competitiveness away from just hdtv to the 
need to find solutions for major economywide problems of primary 
importance to national competitiveness 
tom long representing the american electronics association 
said the report was narrowly focused on hdtvs potential use in 
home tv receivers 
hdtv he said would be a far more important technology driver 
in engineering work stations and highend personal computers and 
for development of better manufacturing techniques 
the association has proposed a package of federal support for 
hdtv that would include 1 billion in loans and loan guarantees for 
manufacturing facilities and 300 million over three years to 
expand the 30 million already allocated to the defense advanced 
research projects agency for hdtv research 
juan a benitez commerce department deputy assistant secretary 
for science and electronics reiterated the bush administrations 
proposal to spur hdtv through lower capital gains taxes a 
permanent rampd tax credit and possible antitrust exemption for joint 
industry ventures

the television industry may be getting a 
chance to adopt voluntary guidelines aimed at curbing violent 
programming 
the house voted 39918 tuesday to give television networks 
local stations producers and the cable tv industry a threeyear 
antitrust exemption to work up guidelines for depicting nonnews 
violence on television 
the vote sent the measure to the senate which passed a similar 
bill may 31 
at present such discussions would violate the sherman antitrust 
act which caused the demise of previous industry selfregulation 
under the television code of the national association of 
broadcasters 
the senate version of the bill was approved with an amendment by 
sen jesse helms rnc that also would allow the tv industry to 
discuss ways to curb scenes that glorify drug use and portray 
sexually explicit material 
a housesenate conference committee will have to work out 
differences in the two bills which probably wont take place until 
after the august congressional recess expected to begin friday 
david carle a spokesman for the bills chief senate proponent 
sen paul simon dill said president bush had not indicated he 
opposed the measure and was expected to sign it when it reaches his 
desk 
this is indirect censorship pure and simple rep don 
edwards dcalif said during debate on the bill monday night 
but one of the authors of the measure rep dan glickman 
dkan said the legislation was necessary in a tv age in which 
conservatively children are exposed to 12000 violent acts a 
year on television 
i believe the television industry wants to accept a degree of 
help to allow them to deal with the problem glickman said 
adding that constitutional experts who testified before the 
judiciary committee said this bill did not conflict with the first 
amendment 
rep howard berman dcalif a cosponsor of the bill said he 
had changed his mind 
now i have concluded that it is a mistake berman said 
the notion that the wildings of new york the crime rate of the 
district of columbia are a direct or even a partial result of 
violent television is a dubious notion at best 
the senate twice before has passed similar legislation sponsored 
by simon who has said overwhelming evidence exists that tv 
violence contributes to aggressive and destructive behavior in 
viewers 
both senate bills died when the house failed to pass them house 
legislation had been bottled up in the judiciary committee under 
thencommittee chairman peter rodino dnj but the tv violence 
bill passed out of the house committee this year under a new 
chairman rep jack brooks dtexas 
broadcasters aware that congress could impose mandatory 
restraints have supported the legislation but are concerned that 
they would be vulnerable to lawsuits from anyone they did not 
include in the talks on curbing violence 
the american civil liberties union has called the legislation a 
trojan horse that could open the door for eventual government 
censorship of tv

president bushs cleanair bill could cost 
businesses and consumers money but it remains the best hope for 
breaking a decadelong stalemate a coalition of the nations major 
industries says 
there is no gift here for consumers workers or 
businesses coalition administrator william fay said tuesday in 
answer to environmental groups that contend the bush proposal is a 
sellout to industry 
representatives of the petroleum chemical and auto industries 
all members of the clean air working group offered a mixed review 
of the bush plan at a news conference 
fay said the legislation would dramatically control acid rain 
tighten auto and truck emission standards force some cities to 
adopt an alternative motor fuels program and cut ozone emissions 
and airborne toxic chemicals 
but some of the measures fay said would go too far in slashing 
industry profits hurting competitiveness and costing consumers 
money when pollution control costs are passed on 
the industry representatives criticized two cornerstones of the 
legislation use of alternative fuels for some motor vehicles sold 
in severely polluted cities and a cap on sulfurdioxide emissions 
that would prevent utilities from expanding when demand for 
electricity is rising 
sulfur dioxide is the main component of acid rain which has 
destroyed trees and lakes in the northeastern united states and 
canada 
despite the criticism fay said the bush plan should be the 
basic legislative text from which a final bill will be drawn 
it addresses serious issues such as ozone and toxic air 
pollution he said and the president has made a serious effort 
to consider costs and build flexibility into the bill 
the bill fay said is a much better alternative than competing 
bills backed by environmental groups those bills would give 
industry far fewer choices in devising ways to improve air quality 
fay and other industry representatives say bushs original 
annual cost estimate of 14 billion to 19 billion would be far too 
low and would cause layoffs because of expense to industry 
he wouldnt predict how many jobs would be lost or give 
industrys estimate of the cost 
the provisions that upset the industry group the most have been 
cited again and again by administration officials as cornerstones 
of the legislation 
the alternative fuels plan would require that in areas with 
severe ozone pollution at least nine cities vehicles with 
cleanburning fuel must be sold according to the following 
schedule 500000 in the 1995 model year 750000 in the 1996 model 
year and 1 million in each of the model years from 1997 through 
2004 
were suggesting the mandate should not be there because 
automakers arent certain the technology is perfected or that 
consumers would accept the cars fay said 
michael mason a lobbyist with the american petroleum institute 
said his oil industry trade group believes the proposal to be a 
big mistake saying there should be a level playing field in 
which all fuels should be able to compete 
mason said the environmental protection agency has mostoften 
mentioned methanol as the likely alternative fuel a product made 
from natural gas that likely would come from saudi arabia iran or 
the soviet union 
he contended the epa appeared to be biased against giving us 
petroleum companies the chance to produce a cleanerburning 
gasoline 
the bush plan also would reduce sulfurdioxide emissions by 10 
million tons by the end of 2000 based on 1980 levels but the 
measure also would cap emissions at the reduced level thus 
restricting growth of utilities unless they could further reduce 
their emissions from existing plants 
the cap on such emissions fay said is unnecessarily 
restrictive limits economic growth and makes it difficult to 
build new factories and power plants

michael harrington remembered as the 
conscience of america who inspired such leaders as the rev 
martin luther king jr and president kennedy with books about 
americas poor has died of cancer at 61 
the political theorist and longtime activist died monday night 
at his home in suburban larchmont the death was announced tuesday 
by the city university of new york where he was a professor of 
political science at queens college 
he wrote 16 books on the problems of massive poverty in the 
midst of affluence and on the cultural stress associated with 
technological advance 
in a 1987 interview with the associated press harrington 
recalled how key individuals including king and kennedy seized 
upon his book the other america poverty in the united states 
to rally for the federal war on poverty 
the luck was that the book came out at a time when there was a 
president of the united states who read books john kennedy and he 
read it harrington said it led him to decide to make poverty 
an issue in the 1964 campaign 
he was killed before he could do it but that set in motion the 
process that led lyndon johnson to declare war on poverty 
harrington also was active in the civil rights movement the 
antiwar movement and the movements against apartheid in south 
africa and against us intervention in central america 
he grew up in st louis in a middleclass family that fared well 
financially even during the great depression 
he became attracted to socialism while at yale law school which 
he attended for a year but harrington did not come facetoface 
with poverty until he went to work as a social worker for the st 
louis board of education a job he got through political pull 
it was a rainy day where i walked into a building and all the 
doors and windows were closed and the building stank so much that 
i almost got nauseous because all of the smells of the backed up 
toilets and the dead rats and the cooking smells of a hundred years 
were all there he recalled in the interview 
at that moment i said to myself this is something i better 
spend the rest of my life trying to abolish 
city university chancellor joseph s murphy said michael 
harringtons intellectual energy dynamism and social commitment 
enriched an entire generation 
he was the conscience of america a champion of the 
downtrodden and afflicted

his latest book socialism past and future was published 
by arcade press last month 
referring to the other america victor navasky editor of 
the nation to which harrington contributed for more than 20 years 
said it was one of the very few times that a book led to a 
federal program the war on poverty 
ever since then theres been a new consciousness that we 
should do something about poor people 
he managed to use the s word and call himself a socialist 
and still have access to the mainstream media and political 
parties 
harrington taught at the universities of paris illinois 
michigan and california at los angeles as well as at harvard 
university and the national war college

judge alcee l hastings fighting to remain on 
the us district court bench says he had nothing to do with a 
plot to get a 150000 bribe in a florida racketeering case 
no sir hastings said tuesday under questioning by his 
attorney about the plot to get the 150000 bribe 
the first black federal judge in florida hastings was impeached 
by the house a year ago on charges of plotting to elicit a bribe 
lying to the 1983 jury that acquitted him of that charge and 
improper disclosure of information from a federal wiretap 
a 12member panel is gathering evidence for the full senate 
before it votes on whether to impeach him and deprive him of his 
89500 annual salary 
also tuesday the panel voted unanimously to move disbarred 
washington lawyer william borders a step closer to being held in 
contempt and perhaps jailed for refusing to testify 
borders convicted and imprisoned for 33 months in the case 
refused twice last week to testify asserting his right against 
selfincrimination 
the committee contends that he cant refuse to testify on fifth 
amendment grounds because he already has been granted immunity the 
next step would put the issue before the full senate and then a 
court 
taking the stand in his defense the 52yearold hastings 
offered an explanation for one of the key points being used against 
him 
he said he appeared for dinner at 8 pm sept 16 1981 in the 
dining room of the fontainebleau hotel in miami earlier borders 
had promised to produce hastings in the dining room at that time on 
that date 
the idea was to prove borders could influence the judge and thus 
encourage a payoff from a man he believed to be a defendant trying 
to buy his way out of a threeyear racketeering sentence 
unknown to borders he was talking to an fbi undercover agent 
wearing a hidden tape recorder 
hastings said he went to the hotel that night with a date 
because borders had suggested that he would meet him there 
however borders was in las vegas 
hasting said he wasnt surprised that borders didnt show up 
hastings has always maintained that borders a longtime friend 
and law school classmate was a rainmaker who boasted of 
influence he didnt actually have as a means of drumming up clients 
the judge also offered an explanation for behavior prosecutors 
say suggests an effort to elude the fbi on oct 9 1981 the day 
borders was arrested as he drove out of a suburban virginia motel 
with a garment bag stuffed with cash and undercover agent h paul 
rico by his side 
that day hastings was staying at the lenfant plaza hotel in 
washington preparing for a testimonial dinner in honor of borders 
then a leader in the national bar association 
told of the borders arrest hastings quickly left for florida 
and went miles out of his way to baltimorewashington international 
airport to catch a plane when washingtons national airport was 
only minutes away 
i went there to get a flight that i thought would get me to 
fort lauderdale hastings testified i really expected to see 
the fbi at the national airport the baltimore airport or fort 
lauderdale 
agents found him later that night in miami at a friends home

the united states is urging israel to avoid 
endangering american hostages in lebanon as this country uses 
diplomacy and hints at military retaliation as an option to try 
to secure their release 
the soviet union now strengthening its ties with iran readily 
agreed to the us request for help arab governments and 
switzerland also were enlisted tuesday in the us diplomatic 
campaign to get through to proiranian factions that hold the 
americans captive 
the hostages status appeared to be newly imperiled after shiite 
extremists claimed monday to have hanged us marine lt col 
william r higgins in retaliation for israels refusal to free a 
cleric it accuses of involvement in terrorist actions including 
higgins kidnapping last year 
israels offer to swap sheik abdul karim obeid and two other 
captives for all foreign hostages including three israelis was 
spurned by the militant organization known as hezbollah 
officials said the united states sent a strongly worded message 
to nations in the middle east including iran on behalf of the 
hostages we expect those who have influence over the hostage 
takers to exert that influence said one official who spoke on 
condition he not be identified 
while no pressure was brought to bear on israel and no demands 
made for the release of the cleric the bush administration is 
urging israeli leaders not to take any action that might threaten 
the other eight american hostages diplomatic sources said late 
tuesday 
in a series of fastpaced meetings with leaders of the israeli 
government in jerusalem american ambassador william brown asked 
that washington be kept informed of israels actions in the future 
said us officials and diplomatic sources who demanded anonymity 
meanwhile soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze took 
with him on a previously scheduled trip to tehran a us appeal 
that he urge iran to arrange the release of the american hostages 
in lebanon 
in moscow the soviets denounced as inhuman the reported 
execution of higgins but also said israel had aggravated the 
situation by abducting the sheik and registered concern over an 
escalation of acts of violence and terror 
still bush administration officials hoped moscow might be 
influential with iran on the hostages the soviets were approached 
while secretary of state james a baker iii and shevardnadze 
attended a conference on cambodia last weekend in paris 
and in stockholm us assistant secretary of state john kelly 
said he asked soviet diplomat nicolai kozyrev at a meeting tuesday 
on afghanistan that moscow use its good offices to influence the 
iranian government to bring about their the hostages safe and 
immediate release 
us military retaliation as an option was raised at the white 
house an administration source said tuesday it was in the realm 
of the possible 
apart from other considerations though the fact that the 
hostages captors shuttle them frequently from house to house in 
lebanon and live among women and children in slums and camps makes 
targeting the captors difficult 
the immediate concern us and other diplomatic sources said 
was joseph j cicippio a 58yearold comptroller of the american 
university of beirut whose execution was threatened for tuesday 
then put off 
intrigued by the reprieve us officials left open the 
possibility it was prompted by iranian intervention 
at the state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the 
united states had not asked israel to release obeid 
she cited us policy against dealing with or making concessions 
to terrorists 
no we have not because you know our longstanding policy on 
hostages and israel understands the us policy on the matter of 
hostages ms tutwiler said

after raising expectations of dramatic us 
action to prevent the killing of american hostages in lebanon the 
white house is shifting gears trying to dispel notions of an 
administration gripped by crisis or scrambling to launch a military 
strike 
to underscore an appearance of nearnormalcy president bush 
pointedly refused to cancel plans tuesday night for a barbecue 
dinner on the south lawn for members of congress complete with 
country music 
while acknowledging these are not easy days bush smiled and 
clapped his hands to the tunes of the oak ridge boys and thanked 
them for bringing a touch of joy touch of brightness to the 
white house 
the president told his guests that even though there are 
complicated times i think an evening like this of just plain 
relaxation with friends is very very significant and very 
important 
it was a different message on monday when a grimfaced bush cut 
short a crosscountry trip and hurried back to washington 
denouncing the brutal murder of lt col william r higgins by 
kidnappers in lebanon 
taking a page out of ronald reagans playbook bush summoned his 
top military national security and foreign policy advisers to a 
white house meeting that was followed by an evening briefing by 
bush for members of congress 
in the reagan white house that kind of scenario suggested the 
united states was about to do something dramatic such as a bombing 
raid on libya or air strikes against libyan oil platforms 
however in this instance military action was put on the back 
burner while the bush administration pursued a diplomatic solution 
an administration source said a rescue operation for the hostages 
or a military strike were not attractive options 
with the lives of american hostages at stake bush was concerned 
military action would risk the lives of us citizens in captivity 
aides said 
and bush the author of a 1986 task force report on terrorism 
knew well the danger posed by military action to innocent civilians 
our principles of justice will not permit random retaliation 
against groups or countries the bush report said 
the report also acknowledged that counterterrorism operations 
are highrisk missions that can have a severe negative impact on 
us prestige if they fail 
the administration got a breather in the hostage drama tuesday 
when the kidnappers of american hostage joseph cicippio announced a 
48hour extension in his threatened execution 
administration officials said it was not certain whether the 
original deadline provided to the news media was real or not or 
whether the reported extension means anything 
in any event the white house clearly did not want bush to be 
portrayed as a helpless captive of terrorists dominated by their 
every move and forced to respond to their actions 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush has 
been conducting other work beyond the hostage matter it has 
not preoccupied the government on a fulltime basis 
we do not want to portray a crisis atmosphere he said 
but we do want to portray one of concern and one in which the 
government shares the concern of the american people for the 
citizens held hostage 
for bush secretary of state james a baker iii adm william j 
crowe jr chairman of the pentagons joint chiefs of staff as 
well as fitzwater the hostage situation is one they have grappled 
with since midway in the reagan administration 
if youve been through this before fitzwater said you 
know youve got to plan for the long term you can never be sure of 
your information 
he said officials experienced in such matters emphasize the 
importance that everyone acknowledges in taking the time to fully 
ascertain the facts to give a thorough assessment of the 
situation to coordinate and diplomatically contact our allies 
it is basically the same process the administration first 
reagan and now bush has been pursuing for years

both the senate and house have bills to impose 
random drug testing on transportation workers but the measures 
still have most of the differences that kept them from being 
combined into a single law a year ago 
the senate commerce committee approved a bill tuesday that would 
require random and other testing of workers with safetyrelated 
jobs on planes trains trucks and buses while the house on monday 
passed a measure affecting only railroads 
similar bills passed both chambers last session but lawmakers 
failed to come up with a single law 
sen jack danforth rmo a sponsor of the senate version said 
the committees bill was the best way to prevent the lethal 
consequences of transportation substance abuse 
the commerce committee has jurisdiction over all modes of 
transportation while the house public works and transportation 
subcommittee that produced the house bill only covers railroads 
unlike the house approach danforth said the senate bill would 
give workers the incentive to seek rehabilitation before they are 
caught while the house measure would encourage workers to wait 
until they are caught 
both bills authorize employers to conduct drug tests before 
hiring on reasonable suspicion and after certain accidents as 
well as at random 
the senate legislation would require airline crews railroad 
crews and truck and bus drivers to submit to a variety of drug and 
alcohol tests 
rehabilitation programs would be set up by employers for workers 
who voluntarily seek help but the senate bill offers no guarantee 
of rehabilitation or continued employment for a worker caught by 
the tests or involved in a drugrelated accident 
the house bill would require testing only for railroad workers 
and would mandate employers to set up rehabilitation programs for 
workers caught under the influence of drugs or alcohol on the job 
the transportation department already has ordered a wide range 
of drug tests including random tests for railroad crews but they 
have been challenged in the courts the tests dont cover alcohol 
abuse 
if the senate measure is passed a conference committee would 
have to work out the differences in the two bills before a law 
could be sent to president bush for his signature

tokyo were mainly making position adjustments today in the absence 
of marketaffecting news

were trying to buy whenever the dollar fell he said 
when investors found out that the dollar wouldnt fall further 
today some of them started to buy it back which helped the 
currency end higher than its opening rate hanada added

suspected spy felix s bloch says he knew his 
presumed kgb contact only as a stamp collector according to 
informed sources who also say the us diplomat hasnt confessed to 
taking money from the soviets 
the sources commenting tuesday only on condition of anonymity 
said suspicions about bloch first arose when the united states 
intercepted a may 14 telephone call to bloch from a man named 
pierre believed to be a soviet agent in paris 
the suspected soviet agent was among several individuals under 
surveillance including one who works for the united nations 
educational scientific and cultural organization unesco 
according to the sources 
bloch and pierre set up a meeting in paris and us authorities 
arranged for surveillance by the french intelligence service said 
the sources the french filmed bloch and the suspected kgb agent 
exchanging briefcases a few days later at a paris restaurant the 
sources said 
another telephone call from pierre to bloch came june 22 after 
the state department official had returned to washington pierre 
voiced veiled concerns that the two of them might be under 
counterintelligence surveillance the sources said 
three sources essentially confirmed details of events first 
reported tuesday by the washington post no charges have been filed 
against bloch 
the telephone call tipping bloch that he might be in danger was 
said to have come on the same day the state department called him 
in stripped him of his building pass and diplomatic passport and 
placed him on administrative leave 
soon afterward the fbi held its only interview with bloch in 
it he portrayed pierre as a stamp collector and used that 
relationship to explain the paris meeting the sources said 
during that interview bloch made no admission that he was 
working for the kgb or that he had accepted money from the soviets 
according to the sources other reports have suggested he has told 
the fbi he accepted money 
meanwhile the apparent standoff in blochs espionage case 
continued tuesday with bloch inside his washington apartment 
which coincidentally is just one block from the soviet consulate 
the apartment was under constant watch by the fbi and the news 
media 
intelligence sources said the job of making an espionage case 
against him remains difficult because of the lack of a confession 
they said that us officials may at some point be forced to 
abandon any plans to prosecute and instead may make a deal with 
bloch to do a damage assessment an inventory of information that 
has been lost or compromised if they remain convinced he actually 
was helping the soviets

mandy patinkin never does anything halfway 
if you need proof the evidence is on display at broadways 
helen hayes theater where he has opened in a dazzling oneman show 
called mandy patinkin in concert dress casual 
theres nothing casual about patinkin except maybe his clothes 
red tshirt gray sneakers and baggy black pants the intense 
performer best known to theater audiences as che guevara in 
evita and georges seurat in sunday in the park with george 
is one of those unique artists who can make an audience cheer at 
the helen hayes he scorches the stage with a virtuosic performance 
that is as exhausting as it is exhilarating 
what makes his show so special 
patinkin doesnt just stand there and sing he takes over each 
song as if it were a story and he were telling it directly to you 
theres a simplicity in his communication that is disarming 
particularly when he is sweetly singing an old standard like 
pennies from heaven or randy newmans marie but hes not 
afraid of a little histrionics either like his almost 
overtheedge downononeknee version of jolsons my mammy or 
on the atchison topeka and the santa fe performed at full 
throttle 
although there is a heavy dose of theater songs patinkins 
wideranging repertoire is astonishing his precise diction and 
exact phrasing make him a natural singer of stephen sondheim songs 
and he doesnt disappoint coming up with two numbers from into 
the woods as well as a heartfelt rendition of the title song 
from anyone can whistle and a hilarious version of buddys 
blues from follies 
his grouping of songs is equally effective not many performers 
would open with doodle doo doo move right into when the red 
red robin comes bobbobbobbin along and then finish with 
tchaikowsky a tonguetwisting recitation of russian composers 
from lady in the dark that danny kaye made famous somehow it 
works 
the show also includes a medley of seven songs from pal joey 
that seems like a miniversion of the rodgers and hart musical as 
well as an impassioned soliloquy from carousel both shows 
sound like ideal vehicles for the singer if he decides to return to 
the musical theater in the carousel number patinkin bounds 
around the stage and even does a few chin ups on a backstage bar 
while he sings 
there are several comic highlights including a wacky version of 
the ella fitzgerald standard atisket atasket that sounds like 
it came out of the television police show dragnet and a rare 
kander and ebb song coffee in a cardboard cup done with all 
the sound effects of a typical greasy spoon restaurant 
there should be a special mention for piano wizard paul ford 
patinkins partner during the evening ford is not just an 
accompanist he anticipates the singers needs and provides the 
support that patinkin needs as he does his dangerous highwire 
balancing act 
one final note no microphones are used during the show its a 
relevation and a relief to hear patinkins unique voice without the 
tinny interference of modern technology mandy patinkin in 
concert truly is live theater at its best 
in other reviews 
howard kissel of the daily news called patinkins show the 
most exciting in ages the range of what he does and the 
imagination and power with which he does it are enough for you to 
imagine he could singlehandedly revive the american musical 
theater kissel wrote 
clive barnes of the new york post called patinkin the greatest 
entertainer on broadway today and described the concert as 
dazzling fun while he can bring tears to your eyes barnes 
said most of the time you are just happy to be in the same room 
with him 
stephen holden of the new york times described the show as 
audacious often brilliant but also a touch wacky instead 
of a bland allamerican confidence he radiates a fierce neurotic 
intelligence holden said

welldressed passersby didnt hesitate to walk 
off with computers desks and other items as us marshals emptied 
the office of a downtown washington computer company whose owner 
recently was shot to death 
this is downtown the wall street of washington and people 
are grabbing and acting like its a farmers market and they dont 
have to pay said wendell holloway a lobbyist who stopped to 
watch the eviction on tuesday 
some people were on their way to work and others were heading to 
a sale at a nearby office supply store when they spotted the 
merchandise at curbside dressed in dark suits ties dresses and 
high heels the treasure hunters tossed about words like 
megabytes and modems as they rummaged 
marshals removed all the furniture and supplies from an office 
that had been leased by kermit ferguson who was fatally shot on 
june 28 by a man who walked into another business he owned no 
arrests have been made in connection with the slaying 
the company was evicted because it owed over 150000 in rent 
said blake esherick comptroller for hunter leasing 
district of columbia police said the scavengers are liable for 
prosecution on a misdemeanor or felony theft charge depending on 
whether what they took was worth 250 or more 
a spokesman for the us marshals office said the property 
belongs to the owners and is not considered abandoned until it has 
been on the curb for 72 hours

after bracing for the worst relatives of 
hostage joseph cicippio said they hoped his twoday reprieve would 
lead to his release after three years in captivity 
for the next two days we want to see what kind of movements 
take place said his brother thomas cicippio this is an 
opportunity for everyone to pull together right now we really 
need this 
shiite moslem extremists who have been holding cicippio in 
lebanon threatened to kill him at 11 am edt tuesday in 
retaliation for israels abduction of sheik abdul karim obeid a 
religious leader 
more than two hours after the deadline they announced a 48hour 
extension 
i am mentally and physically worn out and now we must endure 
this for another two days we are being held hostage just like my 
father said one of cicippios sons david 27 an electronics 
technician from nearby north wales 
joseph cicippio 58 was acting comptroller at the american 
university of beirut when he was kidnapped from the campus sept 
12 1986 
the threat to kill cicippio came shortly after another group 
said monday it had hanged hostage lt col william r higgins in 
retaliation for obeids abduction 
tom cicippio 66 came out from his suburban philadelphia house 
several times tuesday to answer questions from reporters he called 
the extension good news for all of us 
peggy say the sister of terry anderson the longestheld 
western hostage agreed that the extension could improve the 
situation 
i think the longer they talk the longer they delay the 
greater the chances that we may turn this around and get them all 
home said ms say in nashville tenn 
anderson 41 was the chief middle east correspondent for the 
associated press when he was kidnapped in beirut on march 16 1985 
former hostage david jacobsen said the israeli action that 
apparently led to the reported hanging of higgins may have spoiled 
plans for andersons release jacobsen speaking from his colorado 
home said sources in london told him that anderson was to be freed 
last saturday by the new iranian government as a gesture of good 
will 
in michigan virginia rose steen said she fears commenting on 
recent developments while her husband alann remains a hostage he 
was kidnapped in beirut on jan 24 1987 
its not my place to say anything right now she said monday 
afternoon outside her parents clark lake home we worry about 
all of the hostages constantly 24 hours a day 
cicippio anderson and steen are three of the eight americans 
held hostage in lebanon 
before hearing of cicippios extension his brother stuck to his 
belief that diplomacy was the only way to free his brother 
i dont want to see any military action to try to rescue the 
hostages that would seal their fate tom cicippio said 
but two of joseph cicippios sons said force shouldnt be ruled 
out 
its time we took some kind of action who knows what kind of 
threats are going to be made in the next 48 hours i have president 
bush in my prayers and i pray that he makes the right choice 
david cicippio said 
asked about the prospects of military action joseph cicippio 
jr said i think its probably going to come to that 
negotiations are best but thats a last resort if it comes to 
that at least we can say we tried he said 
after his 20year marriage broke up joseph cicippio worked in 
saudi arabia and london before accepting the post in beirut in 
1984 he remained close to his family in the united states and the 
cicippios believed he was protected from kidnapping because he 
converted to islam and married a lebanese woman

the first cruise missiles have 
been removed from greenham common but the women who made the base a 
synonym for protest say they arent going anywhere 
just because the americans are moving out a measly 16 missiles 
everyone expects us to go away catrina howse who had been 
involved in the protests for seven years said tuesday 
we are here to stay this is nothing more than a military 
manipulation exercise weve nothing to celebrate until the entire 
base is shut and restored as common land 
a us air force transport plane flew out the first group of the 
96 missiles at greenham common 50 miles west of london 
press association britains domestic news agency said 16 
missiles were removed tuesday but the air force refused to disclose 
a number 
the missiles are to be destroyed at davismonthan air force base 
in arizona the air force said 
all the missiles are to be removed by 1991 under the ussoviet 
intermediate weapons arms control treaty signed in 1987 
antinuclear campaigners established a peace camp outside the 
base in 1981 but the protests gained prominence after the 
deployment of the cruise missiles on nov 14 1983 
at the height of the protests 35000 women encircled the base 
on tuesday about a hundred women appeared around the base and 
a few climbed over the barbedwire atop the bases fences before 
being rounded up by military police 
greenham will remain a focus of nonviolence we are not 
impressed with this publicity gimmick as long as military weapons 
are in this country we will be here said elizabeth junor 
it is a victory for the women at the camp who have stayed here 
year in and year out and kept the issue in the public light said 
ann harris who brought a bottle of champagne it isnt the end 
but its a great day 
one woman stephanie johnson had come to the base hoping to say 
goodbye to more than the missiles 
ill be glad to see the back of them and those bloody women 
she said i support what they are doing but they have made such a 
mess of the area they will not be missed

constitution to prohibit flag desecration and expressed his views 
before the committee that led the way in blocking his confirmation 
to the supreme court

bork agreed there was an irony in his appearance since the man 
confirmed for the seat bork had been up for anthony m kennedy 
voted with the majority in the supreme courts 54 ruling that flag 
burning is protected free speech bork has said if he were on the 
court he would have voted to uphold a texas law against flag 
desecration 
the committee is considering proposals to amend the constitution 
or enact legislation to reverse a supreme court ruling june 21 that

irans main opposition group claimed 
today that presidentelect hashemi rafsanjani secretly sent his 
brother to syria to closely supervise the killing of lt col 
william higgins 
rafsanjani has been quoted by the soviet news agency tass as 
denying in a meeting with visiting soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze that iran had any relation to the tragedy 
the mujahedeen khalq or peoples holy warriors said in a 
statement that rafsanjani exerts direct control of the radical 
shiite moslem groups believed to be holding western hostages in 
lebanon 
the group said rafsanjani sent his brother mahmoud secretly 
to syria a few days ago in order to closely supervise the terrorist 
acts of the regimes proxies in lebanon including the execution of 
the american hostage col higgins 
the oppositions statement said mahmoud rafsanjani heads the 
iranian foreign ministrys lebanon committee set up to 
coordinate the kidnappers activities 
the statement was sent by telex to the associated press from 
baghdad iraq where the group has its headquarters 
a shiite moslem group calling itself the organization of the 
oppressed on earth claimed it hanged the us marine on monday in 
retaliation for israels abduction friday of a shiite moslem cleric 
in south lebanon 
the group released a videotape that purported to show higgins 
hanging from a makeshift gallows there was no indication when it 
was filmed prior reports indicated that higgins who led a 
75member un truce monitoring force in lebanon may have been 
killed by his captors last year 
moslem fundamentalist groups loyal to iran are believed to be 
holding most of the 16 western hostages in lebanon 
they are thought to be linked to hezbollah or party of god an 
iranianbacked shiite moslem group seeking to dominate the 
12million strong shiite community in lebanon the countrys 
largest sect 
the mujahedeen statement alleged that several hezbollah 
officials sent from tehran to lebanon were told to extend their 
stay in beirut for another two weeks on the orders of 
presidentelect rafsanjani in order to carry out the execution of 
col higgins 
hezbollah denies it has anything to do with hostagetaking 
while iran has sought to distance itself from the reported hanging 
and threats to execute other western hostages held in lebanon 
rafsanjani who was voted president by a landslide majority in 
fridays election is believed anxious to erase irans image as a 
sponsor of international terrorism 
foreign minister ali akbar velayati said monday before higgins 
death was announced the threat against him has nothing to do with 
us however we condemn any kind of kidnapping or death threat 
but on sunday interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi warned 
that islamic groups around the world would retaliate for the 
aduction of the cleric sheik abdulkarim obeid 
the mujahedeen statement said iran used its embassy in damascus 
syria as a headquarters for hezbollah activities in lebanon syria 
is a close ally of iran 
the statement said iranian revolutionary guards based in lebanon 
were responsible for military training of terrorists operational 
planning interrogations and other intelligence operations by the 
regimes proxy terrorist groups in lebanon 
about 4000 revolutionary guards are currently believed based in 
the syriancontrolled bekaa valley in eastern lebanon 
khomeinis 1979 fundamentalist revolution in iran helped spawn 
several shiite terrorist groups in lebanon revolutionary guards 
sent into lebanon during the 1982 israeli invasion helped organize 
hezbollah

a new respiration technique that uses a 
liquid to deliver oxygen to a patients lungs could save premature 
babies and affect the abortion debate researchers said 
in may a baby born after 28 weeks of gestation and within an 
hour or two of death from lung damage was kept alive 19 hours when 
doctors filled the infants lungs with perfluorocarbon an 
oxygencarrying liquid said dr thomas shaffer a temple 
university physiologist and pediatrician who led the team 
he and his colleagues are on call to attempt the procedure again 
when a candidate becomes available shaffer said 
the baby girl born two months premature and weighing just under 
2 pounds was the first human to undergo the procedure according 
to dr michael harrison a pediatric surgeon at the university of 
california san francisico harrison was not involved in the 
research in philadelphia 
if the procedure could be shown to shorten the time a fetus is 
dependent on its mother the technology could affect the abortion 
debate in the country said arthur caplan director of the center 
for biomedical ethics at the university of minnesota in minneapolis 
in its controversial decision july 3 the us supreme court 
ruled states may require doctors to determine through various tests 
whether a fetus at least 20 weeks old is capable of surviving 
outside the womb many states prohibit aborting a viable fetus but 
the courts 1973 decision making abortion legal drew the viability 
line at 24 weeks 
generally premature babies delivered 23 to 24 weeks from 
conception stand a chance of surviving without major disabilities 
researchers said 
if the liquid ventilation technique is successful it could push 
that time period back to 20 weeks shaffer said 
however it is still unclear whether organs other than the lungs 
would be developed enough to sustain life at 20 weeks he said 
aside from premature babies the procedure holds promise for any 
kind of situation where a patients lungs cannot be ventilated with 
gas shaffer said 
dr leland c clark a chemist at childrens hospital medical 
center in cincinnati who first discovered the technique said 
perfluorocarbon acts as a liquid teflon to gently separate parts of 
the lung that stick together after a collapse in a premature baby 
in adults the body produces surfactant which prevents the 
inside of a lung from sticking to itself but in premature babies 
who have not yet developed surfactant or in babies who lack the 
material normal ventilation runs the risk of bursting a lung or 
damaging it he said 
the infant whose lungs had been damaged by two weeks of 
conventional ventilation and had partially collapsed was close to 
death may 10 when the experiment was performed shaffer said 
about a half ounce of perfluorocarbon a liquid that carries 
oxygen was poured into the babys lungs through her trachea he 
said about another quarter ounce of the liquid was allowed to flow 
in and out of her lungs bringing fresh oxygen for 15 minutes 
shaffer said

nissan motor co said today that it plans to make 
its car air conditioners and manufacturing processes free of 
chlorofluorocarbons the gases blamed for destroying the earths 
protective ozone layer by 1993 
nissan became the first of japans major automakers which are 
heavy users of chlorofluorocarbons cfcs to announce a total ban 
on the gases 
nissan spokesman shingo suzuki said the company helped by 
airconditioning makers such as hitachi ltd and calsonic corp is 
developing new car air conditioners that use a new substance to 
replace cfc12 
nissan has used some 1150 tons of cfc12 a year as coolants he 
said and a total of 1500 tons of cfcs a year for all purposes 
accounting for 12 percent of total cfc use in japan 
in the united states the spokesman said nissan already has 
stopped using cfc11 in the making of automobile bumpers and will 
do so in japan by the end of next year 
by the end of 1993 he said the company plans to replace 
cfc113 with water for cleansing automobile parts he said this 
will require the company to develop additional processes to dry 
parts after washing cfc113 dries instantly 
but it depends on the feasibility of cfc alternatives 
suzuki said if we can get stable supplies of new substitutes 
our goal is certainly attainable 
toyota motor co spokesman hiroshi hashimoto said although 
weve been considering environmental issues we havent reached the 
stage to announce anything concrete he said nissans move would 
prompt toyota to consider the issue more seriously and swiftly 
an official of the freon countermeasure division in the ministry 
of international trade and industry called such moves by the 
private sector very welcome 
companies that have to use additional machines and substances in 
the process of cutting cfc use can obtain tax reductions said the 
official speaking on condition of anonymity 
in montreal canada 38 countries agreed in 1987 to reduce 
production and use of the gases under the montreal protocol 
participating countries must freeze their cfc consumption this year 
at the 1986 level and reduce consumption to 5 percent of the 1986 
level by the end of 1999

a lawmaker is proposing a bill that would 
allow drivers to prevent anyone from finding their home addresses 
through state motor vehicle records the way a man apparently 
tracked slain actress rebecca schaeffer 
we intend to prevent this type of tragedy from ever happening 
again assembly speaker protem mike roos said tuesday 
robert john bardo 19 has been charged with shooting miss 
schaeffer to death on july 18 outside her apartment complex he 
allegedly hired an arizona detective agency to locate miss 
schaeffer she was traced through department of motor vehicles 
records 
currently the motor vehicle department will provide the address 
of any license holder to anyone who fills out a request form and 
pays a small fee the form does ask the reason for the request 
under a proposal roos plans to introduce later this month a 
person applying for a drivers license or to register a vehicle 
would be allowed to request their home address be kept 
confidential he said applicants would have to provide a post 
office box or alternative address or the address of an attorney or 
agent that could be given to anyone who files an address request 
he said 
the bill will provide a balance between the publics right to 
know and the right to privacy roos said at a news conference 
outside a dmv office in hollywood 
about 16 million requests were filed in california last year 
roos said 
anyone can obtain the home address of their favorite anchor 
person favorite movie star favorite los angeles dodger or 
favorite politician if they have one he said 
city attorney james hahn said numerous crime victims and trial 
witnesses have been harassed by people who located them through 
motor vehicle records 
right now were all sitting ducks hahn said home is the 
last refuge of your privacy and if someone is intent on doing 
malicious harm theyre going to see it through 
the proposal follows last weeks signing by gov george 
deukmejian of a law inspired by alleged threats against actress 
theresa saldana 
sen dan mccorquodale said the law he sponsored was designed to 
keep violent mentally ill prisoners in mental hospitals after they 
complete their sentences to do so a district attorney must prove 
an inmate will be a danger to someone following release 
miss saldana was stabbed several years ago by drifter arthur 
jackson jackson allegedly wrote letters from prison threatening to 
harm the actress when he was paroled 
a parole board postponed jacksons scheduled june 15 parole for 
nine months saying he had fought with the prison staff and broken 
a window

a former education minister who served a 
reformminded government in the 1970s today emerged as frontrunner 
in the race to become japans next prime minister governing party 
members said 
toshiki kaifu became the leading choice to replace sousuke uno 
who has been in power only two months after 78yearold toshio 
komoto said he would not run for president of the deeply troubled 
liberal democratic party 
that cleared the way for kaifu komotos protege whose 
candidacy drew support from other factions in the conservative 
governing party 
im overwhelmed by the honor and will do my best kaifu said 
at a news conference after komotos faction with 30 members one of 
the smallest in the party united behind him 
kaifu who earlier had said he supported komoto for party 
leader was the only declared candidate for the post the liberal 
democrats president is certain to be elected prime minister 
because of the longgoverning partys commanding majority in the 
lower house of parliament 
kaifu said it was too early to speak in detail about his 
policies but political reform is the biggest issue that has been 
raised by the people 
he said he had received about 110000 in political funds over 
five years from the recruit co conglomerate at the center of the 
influencebuying scandal that originally rocked the political 
establishment in japan 
but kaifu said all the donations had been reported and that he 
had stopped receiving money from the company after the scandal 
emerged last year 
the liberal democrats are to choose a new leader on tuesday 
uno is resigning to take responsibility for the setback in the 
july 23 election in which the liberal democrats lost their majority 
in parliaments upper house for the first time in the partys 34 
years with opposition socialists gaining strongly 
komoto whose faction ranks a lowly fifth in size among the 
partys power blocs told reporters he had decided not to be a 
candidate after canvassing opinion in the party where many members 
say they want a younger president to help repair the partys image 
ive decided that having kaifu run is the most appropriate and 
the best the party elder said 
kaifu a 10term member of the lower house was a follower of 
the late prime minister takeo miki who led the government from 
1974 to 1976 following kakuei tanakas scandalplagued 
administration 
miki was known as the mr clean of japanese politics for 
efforts he made to throttle back corruption and kaifu served as 
deputy chief cabinet secretary under miki 
later kaifu served twice as education minister totaling about 
two years 
he is a member of the party reform committee that was set up in 
the wake of the recruit scandal 
the liberal democrats in power for more than three decades 
have lost popularity amid a series of scandals that accentuated the 
partys image as arrogant and complacent the party also railroaded 
through parliament a new 3 percent sales tax that is extremely 
unpopular 
prime minister noboru takeshita stepped down june 2 because of 
the partys low popularity and was succeeded by uno whose 
scandalfree image quickly crumbled amid allegations he had kept 
paid mistresses

the communist party daily pravda today said israel 
had provoked the hostage crisis in lebanon but abducting moslem 
clergyman sheik abdul karim obeid which it called in essence a 
terrorist act 
the pravda commentary by analyst yuri glukhov said fridays 
kidnapping of obeid by israeli commandos was a criminal action 
that provoked the tragic course of events 
a shiite group said it hanged us marine lt col william 
higgins on monday because israel refused to release the cleric 
kidnappers have threatened to kill another american hostage 
joseph cicippio on thursday if obeid is not freed 
pravda focused on israels terrorist actions over the past 
years including abductions and political assassinations and said 
the israeli occupation of the west bank made the entire palestinian 
people the hostage of an aggressive policy 
the soviet foreign ministry also blamed israel for sparking the 
hostage crisis in a hastily called briefing tuesday spokesman 
vadim perfiliev denounced the killing of higgins as inhuman but 
accused israel of aggravation of the situation

a major issue hanging over the 1990 census is 
resolved with the decision to include military personnel stationed 
overseas but congress is arguing over whether to keep counting 
illegal aliens 
the house blocked an effort tuesday to require aliens to be 
excluded from the census numbers used in house reapportionment 
every decade but the question still may be raised in committee and 
in the senate 
the national head count will be taken april 1 1990 census 
figures are used to redistribute the 435 house seats among the 
states every 10 years and to distribute federal aid to local 
governments 
the reapportionment issue has riveted the attention of house 
members from states where slow growth threatens to result in losses 
of house seats most of these states are in the north where growth 
has lagged behind that of the south and west 
undocumented aliens are largely concentrated in the south west 
and industrial states like new york and other states fear a loss 
of power to those areas if the aliens are counted 
while aliens have been counted in the past military personnel 
stationed overseas have not 
the commerce department settled that problem by announcing it 
will work with the defense department on ways to count the 12 
million to 16 million military and civilian defense workers who 
live overseas 
the problem has been in deciding which states may count these 
people as residents that has yet to be decided but possibilities 
include counting the state where the person owns a home or the last 
state where he or she lived for at least six months 
the battle over illegal aliens meanwhile was taken up both in 
committee and on the house floor 
rep tom ridge rpa unsuccessfully sought to attach a ban on 
counting aliens to an appropriations measure providing 58 million 
to run the state justice and commerce departments next year 
including 800 million to take the census the bill was approved 
258165 and sent to the senate 
opponents noted the constitution requires house seats to be 
apportioned based on all the persons residing in a state 
every census since the constitution was created has counted 
all residents of the states both citizens and noncitizens 
observed rep don edwards dcalif 
congress is empowered to identify those to be counted in the 
census responded ridge the census bureaus 4 billion budget for 
the census is large enough to identify and separate out the illegal 
aliens he said 
rep mervyn dymally dcalif charged the debate is really over 
population shifts that will lead to more house seats for southern 
and western states 
pennsylvania i dont care what they do unless they go down 
to the southwest and bring the people back theyre going to lose a 
seat said dymally 
rep tim valentine dnc said however that counting illegal 
aliens is not fair it may be constitutional but its just not 
right 
census officials generally have opposed any attempt to delete 
illegal aliens contending they cannot determine who is in the 
country legally asking people about their status likely would 
result in people lying or refusing to participate in the count 
officials say resulting in a potential undercount of residents in 
many areas

defense minister yitzhak rabin today defended 
israels kidnapping of a lebanese shiite clergyman saying the 
cabinet considered the dangers to foreign hostages in lebanon 
before approving the abduction 
speaking to parliament rabin also disclosed that the cabinet 
had approved fridays capture of sheik abdul karim obeid two months 
ago 
he said final approval was delayed until every grain of 
possibility for dialogue had been exhausted on winning the 
release of three israeli soldiers believed held in lebanon 
rabin said israel did not inform any other country of its 
intentions to abduct obeid we didnt include any other country 
before the action and did not even offer information about it he 
said 
the 12member inner cabinet of prime minister yitzhak shamir 
also met today to discuss the hostage crisis but there was no word 
on the outcome of that meeting 
in his address to parliament rabin said israel has rejected an 
international red cross appeal to visit obeid who was abducted 
along with two associates from the south lebanon village of jibchit 
he said israel would agree only if the red cross was able to 
visit israeli captives 
during his 22minute address rabin read anew israels offer to 
swap lebanese shiite prisoners held by israel and for 16 western 
hostages and the three israelis 
israel is believed to be holding up to 60 shiites in israel and 
allied militias in south lebanon are believed to hold an additional 
300 
rabin defended the obeid kidnap against criticism that israel 
did not consider the dangers to foreign hostages 
we took into consideration all the possible reactions he 
said we saw them all including the actions that already took 
place and ones even worse 
a shiite group calling itself the organization of the oppressed 
on earth claimed it killed marine lt col william higgins on 
monday after israel refused to free obeid a second group said 
another american hostage joseph cicippio would be killed on 
thursday unless the cleric is freed 
israel maintains higgins was killed several months ago 
rabin said the cabinet approved the abduction of obeid a 
spiritual leader of the proiranian hezbollah movement that is 
believed an umbrella group for hostagetakers in lebanon after 
extensive efforts to gain freedom for its captured soldiers he did 
not detail those efforts 
so the government of israel decided to allow the army to 
apprehend the leader of the hezbollah in south lebanon so we would 
have in our hands valuable property for a prisoner swap he said 
he described the abduction of obeid whom he accused of 
involvement in higgins kidnap and the abduction of two israeli 
soldiers as very successful 
on this stage i want to send my blessings to the chief of 
staff and the commanders of the army and the unit that carried it 
out on the way this mission was carried out he said 
rabin spoke in response to three motions of no confidence 
introduced by three small araboriented parties the motions in the 
120seat body were defeated by a 315 vote with one abstention and 
most of members absent 
mainstream opposition groups refused to join in the attack on 
the government saying lives were at stake and criticism should be 
postponed 
the defense minister was interrupted at one point by an arab 
member of parliament mohammed miari who chided rabin for 
announcing his hostage swap offer 30 minutes after the deadline set 
for higgins purported hanging 
communist and arab legislators accused the government of 
kidnapping obeid to divert attention from efforts to resolve the 
palestinian problem and end the uprising against israeli occupation

the countrys new prime minister gen 
czeslaw kiszczak played a leading role in suppressing solidarity 
in 1981 but he also helped initiate this years campaign that made 
the union legal again 
once a shadowy figure best known for his crackdowns on 
dissidents kiszczak emerged earlier this year as a valuable 
negotiating partner for the opposition in the two months of talks 
that resulted in solidaritys legalization and in partially free 
elections 
despite kiszczaks new outlook solidarity opposed him for prime 
minister members of the communistallied peasant party also talked 
of defecting but he gained victory by a slim margin today in 
parliament 
the 63yearold army general who has been interior minister 
since 1981 and thus supervised the nations police forces donned a 
civilian suit for this years talks with solidarity he often drove 
his red peugeot to a palace in downtown warsaw where negotiations 
were held 
with a mixture of charm and toughness kiszczak quickly 
impressed union negotiators he disarmed underground writers by 
praising their essays 
it was kiszczak who made the proposal for talks with the 
opposition on political and economic reform a year ago during a 
wave of nationwide strikes polands worst labor unrest since the 
early days of solidarity seven years ago 
solidarity leader lech walesa refused to commit solidarity to 
talks without a pledge that the union would be legalized in a 
dramatic reversal president wojciech jaruzelski then the 
community party leader pushed through an offer to restore the 
unions legal status at a party plenum in january 
three weeks later as chief negotiator for the government side 
kiszczak opened the negotiations agreements reached april 5 led to 
legalization of solidarity and partially free elections in which 
solidarity scored dazzling victories july 4 and july 18 
but kiszczak was one of 33 out of 35 top government and party 
officials who ran unopposed on a national slate and failed to get 
the required 50 percent of votes cast 
kiszczaks relations with the opposition were not always so 
cordial 
along with jaruzelski and defense minister florian siwicki 
kiszczak helped impose the december 1981 martiallaw crackdown in 
which thousands of solidarity activists were rounded up and 
imprisoned 
three years later interior ministry security police on his 
payroll murdered the rev jerzy popieluszko a prosolidarity 
priest who kept the ethos of the union alive in monthly masses for 
the homeland at his warsaw parish 
kiszczak saw that the four officers were convicted of murder 
but the trial stopped short of revealing any higherlevel 
involvement which some opposition members still suspect 
as head of the ministry responsible for containing the 
opposition which flourished underground after martial law kiszczak 
developed a deep knowledge of solidarity 
one leading solidarity activist who has spent years in jail 
recently joked that one of the best collections of underground 
literature can be found in the ministrys basement 
born in 1925 kiszczaks war experiences contributed to the 
evolution of a tough young officer shipped by the nazis to work 
as a forced laborer in the southwestern city of wroclaw kiszczak 
escaped and made his way to communist resistance forces in austria 
he joined the communist party in 1945 and helped in the campaign 
against polish partisans opposed to the imposition of communist 
rule 
kiszczak later attended the voroshilov academy of the soviet 
armed forces in moscow and was promoted to general in 1973 he 
served as head of military intelligence between 1972 and 1979 and 
head of the military police in the ministry of national defense 
between 1979 and 1981 
jaruzelski named kiszczak head of the interior ministry in 
august 1981 several months before the crackdown on solidarity

here is a text of the acceptance speech by 
interior minister czeslaw kiszczak after his election as prime 
minister the speech was monitored on polish television and 
translated by the associated press 
i would like to thank you for entrusting me with the honorable 
mission of forming the government of the polish peoples republic 
the confidence which i enjoyed in the support for my candidacy i 
treat as an obligation i will do whatever is in my might not 
to fail this confidence 
with attention i approach those deputies who voted against my 
candidacy their opinion inclines me toward an active search for 
ways and means of gaining a broader parliamentary and social 
understanding and approval for the activities of the government 
which i intend to form 
i face and naturally the high chamber the sejm faces the 
question of the shape of the new cabinet its program and 
philosophy of functioning 
i state with regret that so far the concept of creating a 
grand coalition government has not been accepted 
i think that a government of such a construction would be most 
appropriate today for overseeing the course of issues of the 
country that is why in forming the cabinet on as broad a basis as 
possible i will not give up efforts to attract to it 
representatives of opposition circles with a hope that in the 
future a grand coalition government will be possible 
i opt for a government of the roundtable 
i do not refer here only to the symbol of agreement and national 
reconciliation but most of all to its substantial content and ways 
of shaping the process of dialogue a vision of polands 
development has been outlined in the roundtable accords reached 
between solidarity and communist authorities in april 
corresponding with social aspirations and expectations 
the new government should work with all its effort toward 
realizing this vision especially as far as the shape of the new 
economic order and political reforms are concerned 
as cochairman of the roundtable i feel morally and politically 
obliged to guarantee the concluded agreement of poles i will thus 
do everything so that the directions of the governments work might 
correspond with the supreme reasons of state and the nation 
the seriousness of the internal situation especially in the 
economic sphere imposes the necessity of quick action i would 
thus like to ask the high chamber if i could present the program of 
action and makeup of the council of ministers within the next two 
weeks 
thank you

an analysis of the remains of five gold 
prospectors who died in 1874 supports cannibal alferd packers 
claim that he killed only one experts say 
packer who had led the gold expedition in the rockies said one 
man killed the four others with repeated hatchet blows while packer 
was away from camp packer said he killed that man in selfdefense 
and survived the winter on the flesh of the dead 
four of the five were repeatedly hacked james starrs 
professor of law and forensics at george washington university 
said tuesday summing up the laboratory findings if ever there 
was demonstrative evidence of overkill this is it 
the analysis at the human identification laboratory at the 
university of arizona also concluded that knife marks on the bones 
appear consistent with a conscious effort to deflesh the deceased 
bodies starrs said 
packer was convicted of manslaughter in all five deaths and 
served a prison term 
starrs recently led a team that dug up the remains from a common 
grave about two miles from lake city

here are excerpts of a speech by bronislaw 
geremek leader of the solidarity opposition in the sejm 
explaining why its members opposed the election of czeslaw kiszczak 
as prime minister the text was monitored on polish television and 
translated by the associated press 
the solidarity citizens parliamentary club will vote against 
czeslaw kiszczaks candidacy for the post of chairman of the 
council of ministers 
we stand against this candidacy not because he is the chief of 
the interior ministry of which this part of the chamber so often 
used to be the clientele 
we also know in recent months that gen czeslaw kiszczak can be 
a negotiator and can carry on dialogue with people on the other 
side of ideological and political barriers we also appreciate the 
words uttered in his statement referring to the continuation of 
the philosophy of the round table and the anticipation of 
changes 
we stand against this candidacy because no personnel reshuffle 
within the present political arrangements dictated by the monopoly 
of a single party can solve the countrys problems 
we are of the opinion that one cannot change things by 
continuing the present situation of the country that a break is 
necessary a break that will clearly say that we solidarity 
lawmakers have arrived in this building on wiejska street and i 
would like to be able to say that all of us have come in order to 
change things 
i think that as we sit here a will for change can be found on 
all sides of this chamber however in our opinion changes in the 
way of exercising power must be made so that this change could 
correspond with the polish situation 
a political monopoly of exercising power by one party must be 
discarded and destroyed it does not serve the country 
and this is why we think that with the necessary amount of 
confidence the polish opposition is capable of building a program 
of change and of carrying out this program 
lech walesas statement said clearly that the polish opposition 
all its circles expects deep structural changes and that the 
polish opposition is ready to form a government appropriate to the 
tasks the country faces 
it is ready to take responsibility not only for leading the 
country out of crisis but also for changing the way of exercising 
power because without this change the situation of the country 
cannot improve 
in a responsible way and with a feeling of realism we are able 
to form a government of national salvation 
such a government of change could be a chance for the country

in a major policy reversal prime minister hun sen 
of cambodia said today he has told his vietnamesebacked government 
to welcome a un peace mission to be sent under terms of an 
international accord 
the united states and 18 other nations meeting in paris agreed 
earlier this week to send the investigation team to help prepare 
for a permanent peace settlement in warravaged cambodia 
i have already given instructions to give all the assistance 
necessary to this technical mission hun sen said in a meeting 
with reporters at his hotel near the champselysees 
at the start of the monthlong international conference on 
cambodia on sunday hun sen had opposed the united nations playing 
any role in monitoring a peace plan 
the world body recognizes a coalition of three cambodian 
guerrilla factions as the nations legitimate representative not 
hun sens government 
the vietnamese invaded cambodia in 1978 ousting communist khmer 
rouge rulers and installing the current regime renewed civil war 
quickly broke out and the khmer rouge are now the strongest 
guerrilla force 
hun sen said he changed his mind about the un mission after 
receiving assurances from the foreign ministers of canada and 
australia and un secretary general javier perez de cuellar that 
the visit of the un mission would not imply future un 
involvement in peace efforts 
the un team will present its report to a conference committee 
charged with creating a mechanism for monitoring the pullout of 
vietnamese troops 
hun sen has said the vietnamese forces in his country have 
already been reduced to 26000 vietnam has said it will pull out 
the last of those troops once estimated at more than 50000 by 
sept 27 
it was still unclear however when the un team would leave 
for cambodia and whether the khmer rouge would make the 
unprecedented gesture of allowing the mission to visit the refugee 
camps it controls 
the khmer rouge killed an estimated 1 million people with its 
harsh programs after it drove out a usbacked government and took 
power in 1975 
the groups role in a future government has been a sticking 
point at the conference 
hun sen says the chinesebacked khmer rouge should be destroyed 
china says the khmer rouge should take part in a transitional 
government

even gov michael dukakis hometown 
seems to be turning against him as the state grapples with budget 
troubles 
brookline steadfast backers of the democrat from his days as a 
state representative in 1962 through his failed presidential 
campaign sued the governor today over a plan to cut state aid to 
cities and towns 
the city is accusing dukakis of using one formula to hand out 
state aid and another formula to cut it 
the change means brookline faces a cut of 19 million in state 
aid for schools police and fire protection instead of the expected 
11 million reduction 
to get to the point of where were actually suing the state or 
the governor over his actions is a very painful emotional step for 
me to come to said selectman chairman jeffrey allen a longtime 
dukakis backer 
but i think he was wrong and i dont think his actions in 
changing the local aid formula are legally defensible 
the states budget troubles which many blame on dukakis led 
to a 210 million reduction in aid to cities and towns last month 
john hanson an aide to the governor defended the use of a 
different formula to favor poorer communities when cutting grants 
but he added that the governor has yet to decide on whether the 
formula will even be used 
local aid is distributed by a complicated needs basis 
formula the second formula would make cuts on a per capita basis 
instead

parliament today elected the interior 
minister gen czeslaw kiszczak as prime minister in a victory for 
the longruling communist party whose power has been eroding 
in his acceptance speech kiszczak pledged to try to bring 
members of the solidarityled opposition into his new cabinet he 
asked solidarity to reverse its position that it will not accept 
joint responsibility for governing poland 
although it has rejected joining a coalition government 
solidarity has not ruled out allowing members to serve in the 
cabinet 
kiszczak the nations top law enforcement officer was elected 
by parliaments lower house the sejm by a vote of 237 to 173 with 
10 abstentions the required majority was 211 votes 
as interior minister kiszczak implemented the 1981 martial law 
crackdown that suppressed the free trade union movement but he 
also helped initiate this years campaign that made solidarity 
legal again 
the vote for prime minister had been postponed tuesday when some 
deputies in the communistallied peasant party sought a government 
dominated by lawmakers of the solidarity independent trade union 
but after urgent armtwisting tuesday night by their party 
leadership and communist officials most peasant party members 
ended up voting for kiszczak the handpicked candidate of communist 
president wojciech jaruzelski 
looks like they were frightened said solidarity member jan 
litynski following the vote 
solidaritys floor leader in the sejm bronislaw geremek said 
in a speech before the vote that his group opposed kiszczaks 
candidacy because no personnel reshuffle within the present 
political arrangements dictated by the monopoly of a single party 
can solve the countrys problems 
in reaching out to the opposition in his acceptance speech 
kiszczak said that in forming the cabinet on as broad a basis as 
possible i will not give up efforts to attract to it 
representatives of opposition circles with a hope that in the 
future a grand coalition government will be possible 
i opt for a government of the roundtable he said in a 
reference to the governmentopposition talks that led to 
solidaritys legalization this year 
in his speech carried on polish television the new prime 
minister also promised quick action to deal with the countrys 
economic problems 
after his election kiszczak asked for two weeks to assemble a 
cabinet which also must be approved by the sejm he said he wanted 
deputy prime minister ireneusz sekula who handled economic policy 
under the outgoing government to perform the same function in his 
cabinet 
jan bielecki a solidarity deputy from gdansk said kiszczaks 
government could be one that promotes a free market but retains a 
strong police 
the election completes a twoweek reshuffle of the top polish 
leadership 
jaruzelski for eight years the communist first secretary 
assumed polands new strong presidency with control of the military 
and foreign relations july 19 outgoing prime minister mieczyslaw 
f rakowski succeeded him at the helm of the party saturday and 
now kiszczak a jaruzelski loyalist with his own base in the army 
and defense ministries has become head of government 
before kiszczak was elected the communists lost a key 
parliamentary vote for the first time in postwar poland as 
solidarity pushed through a resolution to investigate the outgoing 
government for economic misconduct 
solidarity believes the outgoing government of rakowski should 
be held accountable for the unraveling of the economy during its 
nine months 
poland convulsed by consumer shortages and tripledigit 
inflation suffered further tuesday when price controls were lifted 
on meat sugar and other basic commodities prices rose 43 percent 
for most goods 
the communist coalition holds a 299161 majority in the sejm 
but the communists have just 173 seats and they had not been sure 
they could count on deputies of the allied peasant and democratic 
parties which used to obediently follow the communists 
according to several deputies the peasant caucus leader 
aleksander bentkowski had proposed that they and solidarity 
jointly form a government with a solidarity prime minister 
we have a general as president now they want a general as 
premier and we know they want a communist to be deputy premier 
said one peasant party member on condition of anonymity what 
kind of new government is that supposed to be 
opposition lawmakers entered parliament after june elections 
the countrys freest in four decades ended the communists 
monopoly of legislative power 
the solidarity victory was so overwhelming the movement won 
all but one of the seats it was allowed to contest that it asked 
to be allowed to form the new government but jaruzelski rejected 
the prospect as unacceptable to east bloc allies 
jaruzelski has promised to allow an eventual transition to 
complete democracy 
kiszczak represented the government in talks with solidarity 
leader lech walesa that led to solidaritys legalization in april 
after a sevenyear ban 
like many leading communists kiszczak failed to be elected a 
deputy in the june elections though he ran without opposition he 
needed 50 percent of the vote to win a seat

a strong earthquake crumbled homes and 
triggered landslides in the remote province of irian jaya killing 
at least 90 people and injuring more than 125 officials said today 
rescue efforts were hampered by the landslides and by cracks in 
the airstrip nearest the stricken area the quake struck tuesday 
and measured 6 on the richter scale 
in the villages of holuon soba and pasema 90 bodies were found 
under demolished homes and tons of mud a spokesman from the 
governors office in irian jaya told the associated press by 
telephone 
about 3000 people live in the villages 
the spokesman supardi said more than 25 people had been 
treated for serious injuries and 100 for slight injuries and about 
300 had been evacuated to safer areas he said more helicopters 
were needed to help evacuate victims 
the quake destroyed a number of villages along the side of mount 
kurima in the district of kurima 2190 miles east of jakarta 
the villages were near the epicenter of the quake which struck 
at 917 am tuesday 
supardi said mud and earth piled 650 feet high were blocking the 
baliem river which flows around kurima district making it 
difficult to reach victims and raising fears the river would burst 
through and flood nearby villages 
bob breuker a senior official from the mission aviation 
fellowship said the missionary organization had two helicopters 
and a cessna helping rescue efforts but that he could not get any 
details from the rescue teams because of bad communications 
irian jaya is one of the most primitive areas in the world 
natives of some of the 240 tribal groups still hunt with bows and 
arrows 
the quake tuesday was the worst in the province since 1981 when 
a quake killed more than 300 people 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude an earthquake of 6 can cause severe damage

james chaney andrew goodman and michael schwerner and denied being 
an fbi informant 
i didnt have nothing to do with it burrage told the 
clarionledger im not going to have anything to do with it now 
the state never charged anyone with the murders which have 
become the focus of renewed attention since being dramatized in the 
movie mississippi burning several men were convicted of civil 
rights violations in the case 
the 1964 report to mississippis nowdefunct sovereignty

rains and tornadoes into central texas today while divers renewed 
the search for 10 crewmen missing since their oil rig capsized in 
the gulf of mexico 
at least three deaths were blamed on the storm a man died after 
falling from a chevron oil platform off of louisiana and two bryan 
teenagers drowned when they were sucked into a floodswollen 
drainage ditch 
also today tropical storm dean developed into the second 
hurricane of the atlantic season bearing 78 mph winds it surged 
westward toward the caribbean the hurricane was 500 miles east of 
san juan puerto rico moving at 20 mph 
chantal roared ashore tuesday morning at high island on the 
eastern texas coast bringing driving rain and wind up to 80 mph 
the first hurricane of the atlantic season caused flooding and 
scattered power outages but little serious damage 
it lost strength within a few hours and was downgraded to a 
tropical storm and then a tropical depression by tuesday night 
winds dropped to about 30 mph 
by early today the storms remains were spread over about 90 
miles from college station to waco triggering rain and tornadoes 
no damage was immediately reported in central texas forecasters 
said the dallasfort worth area could get as much as 5 inches of 
rain in gusty thunderstorms today 
divers today resumed their searched for the oil workers 20 miles 
off morgan city la their selfpropelled rig which can be floated 
when its 100foot legs are retracted capsized monday while trying 
to outrun chantal 
rough seas hampered the divers who were equipped with 
highpowered lights to search the darkened rig there were 
conflicting reports about where the men were last seen in the 
water or in the watertight crew quarters now submerged in about 30 
feet of water said coast guard petty officer glenn lamont 
theyre not sure where theyre likely to be exactly its 
going to take awhile the divers are going to move real slow and 
real cautiously he said 
in bryan about 90 miles northwest of houston police said two 
teenagers drowned while they and two friends were riding rubber 
rafts on a rainswollen stream the boys were swept into a drainage 
pipe under a highway bypass 
skies were sunny today in the houston area where on tuesday 
hundreds of stalled cars and trucks lined flooded roads and some 
motorists sat atop their vehicles as they waited for the water to 
recede 
nena neal whose family lost nearly all of their possessions in 
a 1979 flood in dickinson south of houston tied ribbons around 
the bases of trees to watch the progress of the rising water in her 
yard 
we just got through celebrating 10 years since that flood we 
had water up to here in that one mrs neal said using her hand 
to mark a spot more than 3 feet high we made it through that and 
the lord gave us so much more and we have flood insurance this 
time thats the main thing 
the coastal city of galveston escaped much of chantals wrath 
but the 656 inches of rain in a 24hour period there broke a 
110yearold record 
most of the homes in the area directly hit by chantal were built 
on stilts limiting much of the damage to roof tiles exterior 
walls and electric lines it wasnt too bad but it sure shook 
that trailer said bill estis who lives in a 27foot travel 
trailer in gilchrist east of galveston i was going to move it 
out this morning but it came in too early so i just decided to 
wait it out 
estis then did what few others along the texas coast would have 
considered in winds topping 50 mph on the leading edge of a 
hurricane 
he went fishing 
oh i just figured id come down here and give it a try i 
caught one while the eye was passing over but i havent had a bite

possibility of a death sentence to facilitate extradition

the justice department was investigating 
allegations that famed austrian conductor herbert von karajan had 
been involved in nazi persecutions but the probe was dropped when 
he died last month a government lawyer said today 
the investigation was started several months ago after the 
department was informed of certain allegations about the 
conductor said neal m sher who heads the justice departments 
office of special investigations 
we were looking at what his role in nazi persecution might 
have been said sher whose office has investigated thousands of 
such cases over the years i dont know where the investigation 
would have led but there might have been a question of the 
watchlist sher said referring to a list of people banned from 
the united states for their nazi pasts

the crew of the nuclear submarine 
tennessee thwarted last week by antinuclear protestors launched 
a trident 2 missile today in the first successful underwater test 
of the navys newest deadliest weapon 
the tennessee was cruising about 50 miles off cape canaveral 
when the 44foot trident 2 burst to the surface ignited and 
propelled a dummy warhead package far down the atlantic tracking 
range 
the navy announced several minutes after the 11 am firing that 
the test flight was a success a navy statement provided no details 
the results were in sharp contrast to the trident 2s first 
submarine launch on march 21 when the missile pinwheeled out of 
control and exploded four seconds after it was launched from the 
tennessee 
investigators traced the problem to a mechanical linkage 
responsible for moving the rocket nozzles back and forth the 
system was redesigned 
the test had been scheduled last friday but was halted when two 
large greenpeace usa ships sailed into the launch danger zone in 
international waters two small motorized rafts dispatched from one 
of the ships buzzed the submarine and crew members attached three 
nuclear free seas banners to it 
the greenpeace vessels did not return today protest officials 
said last week they had made their point by stopping the launch and 
calling attention to their cause 
the launch today was one of about eight underwater tests planned 
over the next few months if all goes as planned the navy will 
dispatch the tennessee on patrol in march with 24 of the 
nucleartipped missiles 
each of the 237 million missiles is designed to hurl up to 10 
nuclear warheads to different targets more than 4600 miles away 
the navy had hoped to have the trident 2 operational late this 
year but that was delayed by the march explosion

the killing fields the movie that 
showed the brutality of khmer rouge rule in the 1970s in cambodia 
will be shown in a cambodian theater friday for the first time the 
director said 
among those attending the screening will be sydney schanberg 
the american journalist depicted in the 1984 academy awardwinning 
film who will make his first visit to cambodia since he left there 
14 years ago 
director roland joffe said today it is time to show the film 
there because diplomatic events have created optimism that peace 
will return to the country 
it is important that cambodians see this film so that they can 
actually feel that there is a chronicle of their own history the 
british director told a news conference in bangkok 
the showing of the film in the national theater in pnomh penh 
the cambodian capital is being organized by operation california 
a usbased relief agency 
one of its cofounders richard walden said the premier of the 
vietnamesebacked government in cambodia hun sen gave the 
goahead in march 
the film depicts how schanberg then a reporter for the new york 
times and his cambodian assistant dith pran were separated as 
the khmer rouge entered phnom penh in april 1975 and began its 
fanatical revolution 
hundreds of thousands died in torture chambers and slave labor 
camps but dith pran made it out in a trek to the thai border 
through fields littered with human bones 
vietnamese troops invaded in 1978 and installed a new 
government which is fighting a threeparty resistance that 
includes the khmer rouge 
schanberg who now writes for newsday said there was a growing 
fear the khmer rouge could return to power as vietnam carries out a 
pullout it has promised will be completed by late september 
that he said is a pretty horrible and awesome thought 
peace talks in paris this month are aimed at setting up an 
interim government 
walden said the film has been available in videocassette in 
phnom penh but this would be the first screening in a theater and 
with official sanction 
a cambodian film on the khmer rouge rule shadow of 
darkness also will be shown in the theater on friday

a leading intellectual suspected of acting as 
a key link between deposed communist party chief zhao ziyang of 
china and that nations crushed student movement has escaped to 
the west an activist said today 
the intellectual chen yizi fled from china to france several 
weeks ago on an underground railroad the hong kong activist 
said chen who is about 50 was director of the institute of 
restucturing the economy an influential think tank when zhao was 
in power 
while in paris chen participated in meetings to form an 
overseas organization to push for democracy in china however he 
did not meet the press nor was his identity revealed to reporters 
indeed some western reports said he had been arrested in 
beijing 
the hong kong activist who demanded anonymity said chen 
remained in the west but declined to reveal his current 
whereabouts there was no way to immediately confirm the report 
but the activist has been reliable in the past 
so far the activist said about 30 people have fled china via 
the underground railroad set up to help prodemocracy leaders 
escape a government crackdown they include essayist yan jiaqi and 
student leader wuer kaixi who were in paris with chen but have 
since gone to the united states 
a western diplomat in hong kong has said communist authorities 
apparently wanted to establish direct ties between chen and zhao to 
prove the purged party leader secretly backed the student movement 
chinese authorities began their crackdown on the spring protests 
by sending troops into beijing on june 34 to sweep away 
demonstrators 
the official chinese news agency xinhua has said nearly 100 
soldiers and police died and that thousands were injured while 
about 100 civilians died and nearly 1000 were injured chinese 
witnesses and western intelligence sources said the death toll may 
have been as high as 3000 
it is unclear to what extent zhao may have been secretly 
supporting the prodemocracy movement so far the official charges 
against him have been vague 
zhao officially purged after the june 4 crackdown has been 
accused of supporting the movement and counterrevolutionary 
turmoil however his specific wrongdoings have not been spelled 
out 
more recently the staterun media have accused him of 
responsibility for high prices and widespread corruption 
thousands of students and other supporters of the prodemocracy 
movement have been arrested in past months

the arizona daily star tucson ariz on israels kidnap of 
sheik obeid 
an unnecessary gamble by israeli security forces has apparently 
backfired into a grisly execution a violent seizure ended in 
violent death if a news report is true and israel cannot justify 
a means that provokes a tragic end regardless of the intent 
the casualty of this risky kidnapping was not just a failed 
negotiation but a human being marine lt col william higgins a 
man assigned to the united nations peacekeeping force in the 
region 
israelis didnt take higgins prisoner in february of 1988 nor 
did israelis cruelly string him up and strangle him yet israel has 
to bear some of the responsibility for what happened 
the tactic of kidnapping sheik abdul karim obeid an influential 
shiite moslem cleric was apparently done in hopes of exchanging 
three captured israeli soldiers and other foreign hostages obeid 
is considered by israeli officials as a spiritual leader of the 
shiite moslem hezbollah militia an umbrella group for factions 
believed to be holding 17 hostages nine of them americans obeid 
is also tied to the higgins kidnapping 
the risks were tremendous if the mission had succeeded and the 
hostages and soldiers were handed over in return for obeid 
criticism of israel would be muted but it still ought to occur 
the tactic itself is open for judgment 
much of the world supports israels struggle for survival but 
israel ought to examine this aspect of its struggle

based on several decisions reached the past few days we cant

money 
the senate overwhelmingly agreed to back president bushs costly 
stealth bomber request the house on the other hand decided to 
delay production of the b2 bomber for one year the majority of 
house members considered the 70 million b2 bomber program too 
costly in light of the 150 billion budget deficit 
we agree with the house 
spending more for defense and more for ag research might be ok 
if lawmakers were dealing with a balanced budget but they are not 
this nations checkbook is overdrawn its been overdrawn for

capt al haynes the pilot of the united airlines jet that 
crashed july 19 in sioux city iowa says there is no hero in the 
horrifying accident the 185 people who survived the crash of the 
dc10 may disagree 
in his first news conference since the crash haynes said he 
heard a loud noise and began shutting down the planes tail 
engine a short time later he said the crew realized the 
plane had lost all its hydraulic fluid 
when he asked another crew member what the flying procedure for 
those circumstances would be he learned there was none so the 
crew had to develop one as it tried to guide the stricken aircraft 
to the sioux city airport 
the plane crashed landed just short of the runway flipped and 
broke apart 
haynes reminded reporters and others of the 111 people who died 
in the crash and the importance of determining the cause and trying 
to avoid such disasters in the future he modestly said the four 
crew members just did their job 
he should also remember that in doing so they saved 185 lives

the portsmouth nh herald on president bushs space proposal 
the presidents efforts to restore a sense of mission to 
americas space program are certainly long overdue but is he 
serious 
in calling for the establishment of a space station followed by 
manned expeditions to the moon and then to mars george bush 
offered not a clue as to how he proposed to pay for any of it 
experts differ as to the scientific value of each of those 
objectives but theres no doubt that accomplishing any of them is 
going to require a commitment of hundreds of billions of dollars 
as one congressman pointed out theres no such thing as a free 
launch 
if the presidents vague declarations of intent the other day 
manage to set off the kind of national debate on our objectives in 
space that american leaders have been avoiding for the past 20 
years that will be one small step in the right direction

california blazes have blackened more than 175000 acres in those 
states and washington 
some of the firefighters came from as far away as florida idaho 
gov cecil andrus said the influx was obvious at chicagos ohare 
aiport where he waited monday to return from the national 
governors conference 
i saw nothing but green pants yellow shirts and the boots of 
firefighters headed west he said 
more than 5000 firefighters battled uncontained fires on more 
than 80000 acres of idaho range and timber andrus predicted the 
fight could rage for a month 
payette national forest officials evacuated 16 of the 36 
residents of warren a small mining town 120 miles north of boise

kennebec journal augusta maine on the bloch spy case 
we dont have to make a judgment as to spy suspect felix s 
blochs guilt or innocence to recognize that this keystone kops 
surveillance raises civil rights questions how can he defend 
himself against nonexistent charges 
but even granting that bloch may require close watching is this 
the way to accomplish the task 
it has been suggested that the fbi was so embarrassed at the way 
edward howard escaped the country while under the agencys 
aroundtheclock surveillance that this time it felt it needed the 
medias help 
strange stuff any way you look at it even if john le carre 
wrote it we probably wouldnt believe it 
felix bloch may well be a spy as the government believes but 
before making an international cause celebre it would be wise to 
collect the evidence first and make the announcement later

delta democrattimes greenville miss on the crash of flight 
232 
investigators continue to look into the crash of united flight 
232 in sioux city iowa but weve already learned about the 
heroism displayed by many of the people involved in these times of 
contagious cynicism such actions remind us that humans have a 
greater calling 
the heroism begins with the crew of flight 232 only great 
courage skill and decisive action prevented a total disaster and 
saved at least 180 lives 
after the flaming crash passengers selflessly helped one 
another out of the rubble one father rushed to find his baby he 
moved several times toward the infants cries only to be driven 
back by the smoke he and the mother later discovered that another 
survivor had rescued the baby 
ministers priests and rabbis immediately attended the 
passengers blessing and comforting the dying giving hope to 
survivors and rescue workers 
united airlines notified relatives and flew them in to be with 
survivors local restaurants provided free food to survivors and 
rescue workers 
flying remains the safest way to travel but such accidents 
remain a risk amid the tragedy they also can give us a glimpse of 
what the human spirit can accomplish at its best

the philadelphia inquirer on congress and art 
members of congress have found another small item on which to 
spend an inordinate amount of time and rhetoric they have been 
waxing apoplectic about 30000 in federal arts funding for an 
exhibit of photographs by the late robert mapplethorpe 
their outrage is understandable one of the photos was of a man 
urinating into another mans mouth 
a 15000 grant to photograher andres serrano now notorious for 
his shot of a crucifix in urine is also getting panned 
all that these politicians needed to say was that some artistic 
expressions are so revolting to most americans that tax dollars are 
not going to subsidize them 
but congress wouldnt leave it at that the senate voted last 
week to place a fiveyear ban on federal grants while the house 
wants to cut overall funding for the arts by 45000 this amounts 
to sophomoric retaliation 
the national endowment for the arts has received a strong 
message from congress and no doubt will be more careful in what 
it approves for financial support in the future 
as house and senate negotiators talk over the differences they 
should know that the sensible part of congress message has already 
been sent and that whats left in both bills is a rabid 
overreaction

los angeles herald examiner on cutting the capital gains tax 
last year democrats blasted candidate george bushs 
illadvised call for cutting the tax on capital gains which have 
been treated as ordinary income since the passage of federal tax 
reform in 1986 
supplyside economics argues that cutting the capital gains 
tax should spur the kind of investment that contributes to the 
overall growth of the economy such as forming pools of venture 
capital and modernizing factories 
however a lot of capital gains are realized on activities that 
contribute nothing more to the economys productive capacity sales 
of art and antiques stock and realestate speculation and tax 
shelters 
worst of all from the standpoint of tax fairness the primary 
capital gains earners already tend to be the wealthiest of the 
taxpayers the top 5 percent by most estimates 
democratic opposition to the tax cut however is now flagging 
a democratic gang of six on the house ways and means 
commitee recently defected added to the 13 republicans supporting 
the bush proposal those committee members who want to cut the 
capital gains tax now comprise a working majority 
the crowning irony here is that the current capital gains deal 
now under consideration by the committee sponsored by a democrat 
would favor the wealthy even more than the original proposal first 
advanced by george bush

that ordinarily able people are capable of extraordinary competency 
and courage this was an indomitable man at the press conference at 
sioux city iowa a man youd guess hasnt yet counted his cuts and 
bruises and used a wheelchair only to humor his doctor 
the midair crisis that crippled captain haynes jumbo jetliner 
held him and his crew in tortured suspension for nearly an hour 
the challenge to stay aloft to reach an airport to attempt a safe 
landing was beyond the imagining of most of us 
he did it with mental toughness methodically calmly with 
knowing trust in his own ability and intuition 
and he made it all work until seconds before touch down when 
lack of precise control or perhaps a runway crosswind dropped one 
wing into the ground the aircraft cartwheeled and the fore and aft 
section disintegrated among trailing flames 
but 185 of captain haynes passengers survived air safety 
authorities labeled it a heroic and miraculous piloting job his 
own matteroffact declaration that there was no hero only people 
doing their jobs fit him becomingly 
not many people are capable but he gives the impression that

daily record morristown nj on a national environmental 
policy 
if president bush really wants to be the environmental 
president he could start by developing an environmental policy 
what we have now is federal regulatory bureaucracy pushing 
stringent environmental standards in response to public concern 
while the economic facts of life make meeting those standards near 
impossible 
mayor john bullard of new bedford mass speaking before a 
joint session of the environmental and public works subcommittees 
on environmental protection said his city is under court order to 
spend 560 million on clean water projects to meet federal 
standards 
disarray can also be seen in comparing bushs june 12 clean air 
proposal with the administration bill that followed it critics 
contend the bill falls short of the rhetoric on almost every point 
we need a national policy that commits us to a goal of reduced 
pollution and cleaning up existing pollution it needs to be 
realistic too recognizing that while cost of not cleaning the 
environment is our eventual destruction the cost of cleaning up is 
no small potatoes

the milwaukee journal on using aluminum baseball bats 
the same baseball fans who objected to lights in wrigley field 
domed stadiums and artificial turf are sure to get up in arms over 
reports that aluminum bats may be introduced into the big leagues 
aside from whatever value preserving tradition may hold keeping 
metal bats away from major league baseball makes common sense 
despite its many changes in recent years baseball remains 
pretty much the same game it has always been for that reason fans 
can reasonably argue whether wade boggs is a better hitter than 
rogers hornsby was and whether bob feller could make it in todays 
big leagues 
but aluminum bats would change the game much more drastically 
than even the designated hitter has changed it because they have a 
larger sweet spot than wooden bats aluminum bats can turn mediocre 
hitters into good ones and good ones into superior ones thus 
aluminum bats would change baseball in a fundamental way 
but they wouldnt improve it on the contrary giving hitters 
unprecedented new clout would upset the delicate balance between 
pitcher and batter that gives baseball some of its drama and makes 
it so much fun 
aluminum bats dont break and that makes them suitable for 
sandlot leagues which have to worry about money but they dont 
belong in the senior circuit

twenty consultants earned more than 57 
million by helping funnel much of the money in a federal housing 
program to developers in a handful of states that didnt need it a 
senate committee was told today 
most of the 20 consultants were former employees of the 
department of housing and urban development or wellconnected 
republicans hud inspector general paul adams said in a report to 
the senate banking committee 
the consultants were paid by developers to help them get about 
onefifth of the money from a hud program to repair housing for the 
poor 
its so lucrative now that youre going to get some people 
doing some pretty unsavory things to feed at that trough donald 
terner president of the nonprofit bridge housing corp in san 
francisco told the senate committee 
elsewhere on capitol hill today the house government operations 
subcommittee on housing voted 60 to subpoena lance wilson a 
former aide to former hud secretary samuel pierce jr wilson had 
been scheduled to voluntarily testify last week but did not 
appear saying that he wasnt prepared with legal counsel 
and on the senate floor the two party leaders sparred over the 
hud scandal with majority leader george mitchell dmaine saying 
the department was used as a political slush fund where political 
appointees gave favors to politically wellconnected 
individuals 
mitchell also criticized the leadership of hud in the reagan 
administration for not heeding the warnings of the inspector 
general 
minority leader bob dole rkan then complained that 
appointments to several of the appointments to those posts have 
been bottled up awaiting confirmation by the senate 
lets make certain we understand that congress hasnt been 
very cooperative dole said now weve got a situation where 
secretary jack kemp is trying to do the right thing and he 
doesnt have anybody on board 
the senate banking committee voted 170 today to approve one of 
those appointees c austin fitts as an assistant hud secretary 
the nomination of ms fitts who would replace thomas demery one 
of the central figures in the hud scandal now goes to the full 
senate 
adams who conducted the hud study at the request of sen donald 
riegle jr dmich chairman of the banking committee said the 
well is starting to run dry for the outside consultants 
during our survey five developers informed us that because of 
all the recent media attention some billings were not paid in 
full to them adams wrote in his report 
one of those consultants was fred bush ambassadordesignate to 
luxembourg who has had 45000 in payments withheld since april 
the report said bush who is no relation to the president but was 
the chief fundraiser for his 1988 campaign was paid 215000 to 
help land hud funds for developers 
joseph strauss a former assistant to thenhud secretary samuel 
pierce jr made nearly 17 million more than any other 
consultant found by adams inquiry 
others included former interior secretary james watt who got 
300000 former hud secretary and now us trade representative 
carla hills who received 138445 and paul manafort a lobbyist 
and republican political strategist who got 442000 
adams has reported before on the use of consultants in obtaining 
funds from hud but the new report is the first attempt to 
determine the extent and expense of the practice 
under the hud program developers were eligible for tax credits 
and could get hud to subsidize the rent of tenants who otherwise 
couldnt afford it 
developers often received windfall profits through tax credit 
syndication adams wrote excess payments for rent subsidies 
could cost the government more than 413 million by 1999 he said 
in all 51 projects with a total of 7268 apartments funded 
since october 1983 used consultants adams report found that 
accounts for about 20 percent of all huds work in this area during 
that time 
of those projects involving consultants 45 were put in states 
notably colorado oklahoma nevada and wyoming that would not 
have qualified for the funds if huds formulas for determining 
eligibility had been used the report said 
but the two largest states california and new york were 
shortchanged by about 27 percent each the report said 
meanwhile a related study by the general accounting office said 
developers were willing to pay high fees to the consultants because 
the structure and oversight of the hud programs made them virtually 
nolose propositions 
in this manner developers were able to realize substantial 
gains on their limited investments while undertaking very little 
risk wrote john m ols jr who prepared the report

police today shot and killed a black 
man during a raid on his house and said the sovietmade arms they 
found there indicate that swapo guerrillas are smuggling arms into 
namibia from angola 
kierie du rand chief inspector of the south africanruled 
territory said the suspected guerrilla petrus joseph was shot in 
the northern border town of rundu when he brandished a pistol while 
trying to escape after his arrest 
du rand said police found sovietmade explosives a detonator 
and a hand grenade in josephs home in the town 180 miles northeast 
of windhoek 
members of the united nations contingent monitoring namibias 
transition to independence could not be located to accompany the 
police patrol on its mission du rand said 
he said the incident proves swapo guerrillas are crossing the 
border from angola where their bases are to establish arms caches 
in northern namibia and that un troops are unable to monitor the 
situation 
under a multinational agreement linked to the un independence 
plan swapo guerrillas are to remain at bases at least 100 miles 
inside angola or return to namibia as unarmed civilians 
leaders of the southwest africa peoples organization have 
accused the south africanled territorial police of harassing and 
intimidating the movements supporters 
more than 5000 un military and police personnel have been 
deployed in namibia to supervise the campaign leading to 
preindependence elections in november swapo which began a bush 
war against south african rule in 1966 is favored to get the most

the nations hardline communist 
rulers have allowed the domestic branch of the pen writers club to 
reopen and its board will include banned and officiallysanctioned 
authors participants said today 
ivan klima a dissident writer said he and about 20 colleagues 
gathered tuesday in prague and elected a new club governing 
committee he said both he and banned playwright vaclav havel are 
included in the panel 
klima himself was banned after the 1968 reforms known as the 
prague spring were crushed by a sovietled invasion the czech 
branch of the international writers club became dormant around 
1971 in the wake of broad purges of party members including many 
writers 
police detained havel for about three hours tuesday but released 
him in time to allow him to appear at the end of the meeting klima 
and another participant said 
two members of the human rights group charter 77 eva kanturkova 
and milan simecka were summoned to police for questioning to 
coincide with tuesdays meeting thus preventing their attendance 
klima said 
however the official news agency ctk signaled authorities 
approval of the pen club project by briefly reporting that it was 
being formed again 
klima said 10 writers were elected to the clubs governing 
committee or board of directors six dissident or nonconformist 
writers and four older officiallybacked writers the ctk report 
did not discuss the boards makeup 
one of the official writers jiri mucha was elected chairman in 
what klima described as a compromise between the official and 
banned writers 
the efforts to restart the pen club are the first such joint 
initiative in czech literature in almost 20 years 
klima said he saw it as a very good sign that the club was 
permitted to resume activity he said he hopes it can negotiate 
with authorities on publishing previously banned books and lifting 
curbs on banned writers 
over the past year authorities have made small shifts toward 
liberalizing the arts books by franz kafka have appeared for only 
the second time in 20 years and a number of previously banned 
films plays and rock bands were allowed to be seen 
writers such as havel however have remained banned because of 
their refusal to renounce political activities according to 
officials 
in may the 60chapter international pen association voted 
unanimously to admit a russian chapter ending a long quarrel with 
moscow 
soviet participation in the 10000member group has been an 
issue ever since pen an acronym for poets playwrights editors 
essayists and novelists turned down an application by the soviet 
state in 1924 
pen which champions freedom of speech for writers had kept out 
the soviet union because of its persecution of writers and other 
intellectuals 
klima said the czech club will hold its first annual meeting 
next year

a student who defied martial law regulations by 
helping stage a demonstration at beijing university last month has 
been expelled and refused his diploma university officials said 
a public announcement posted on bulletin boards once festooned 
with the posters of the studentled prodemocracy movement said 
xiong dayong 22 had broken regulations banning unauthorized 
gatherings 
with no diploma and an expulsion on his record xiong probably 
will have difficulty finding work 
the notice dated july 25 said xiong a fourthyear student of 
chinese and a member of the communist partys youth league 
incited other students to cause trouble by breaking martial law 
restrictions 
it also accused xiong of being a known criminal stealing 
three bicycles this summer and causing a drunken brawl last year 
on july 23 300 to 400 students sang and beat pots and pans to 
mourn classmates killed june 34 when troops moved into beijing to 
crush the prodemocracy movement 
the students said they held the demonstration because they felt 
oppressed by ideological study classes they were forced to attend 
following the crackdown and because some of them were refused 
permission to join the work units they were assigned to 
most college graduates in china are assigned jobs by the 
government 
most of the 32000 graduates from 80 universities and colleges 
in beijing this year have been accepted by their assigned units 
the official xinhua news agency reported today 
the report said more than 1000 graduates however had not 
found appropriate jobs in part because some companies had dropped 
plans to accept hundreds of students 
the report did not say whether the refusals were due to 
political considerations arising from the prodemocracy 
demonstrations which began in april and were initiated and led by 
students from beijing universities 
also today chinese newspapers said the government announced it 
would inspect the nations 145 million private businesses in a bid 
to recover almost 5 billion in revenues lost through tax evasion 
the state taxation bureau will check the books and tax 
registrations of private industrial commercial and service 
enterprises in august and september for signs of tax evasion or 
other illegal activities newspapers reported 
tax bureau director jin xin said illegal businesses would be 
closed and illegal income confiscated 
the government also is cracking down on corrupt tax collectors 
who are now prohibited from accepting gifts from taxfree and 
taxreduced businesses to help ensure an honest and clean 
government the official xinhua news agency said 
the restrictions are part of a national anticorruption drive 
triggered by the student democracy movement which included demands 
for an end to official corruption

hashemi rafsanjani will be sworn in as 
the islamic republics fifth president on thursday tehran radio 
reported wednesday 
the broadcast said rafsanjanis credentials will be presented in 
a ceremony to ayatollah ali khamenei the incumbent president who 
took over as the countrys spiritual leader after ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeinis death june 3 
although khameneis second fouryear term doesnt expire until 
october he had been expected to step down sooner 
the staterun radio report monitored in cyprus did not say 
whether thursdays ceremony meant that rafsanjani would start his 
duties as president immediately 
rafsanjani the 54yearold speaker of parliament won a 
landslide victory in fridays presidential elections capturing 
945 percent of the vote 
constitutional reforms approved in a referendum alongside the 
election give him considerably enlarged powers by scrapping prime 
minister hussein musavis post 
earlier this week khamenei told musavi to continue his duties 
as prime minister until a new cabinet is set up by rafsanjani 
rafsanjani is considered a pragmatist who would like to ease 
tight governmental control of the economy and resume ties with the 
west 
the presidential elections originally due to be held aug 18 
were moved up about three weeks to hasten the transfer of power 
after khomeinis death 
khameneis decision to step down as president before the end of 
his term appeared aimed at allowing rafsanjani move quickly to 
start reforming irans sluggish economy

shops were empty today the day after the 
government introduced a controversial marketization plan that 
raised some food prices by 300 percent by cutting subsidies 
newspapers reported 
the first day after marketization was a day of rest for the 
sales clerks in the majority of stores reported the opposition 
daily gazeta wyborcza in an article entitled much more expensive 
on the empty shelves 
the government on tuesday announced the highest official meat 
price increases in recent memory and the cost of other key food 
items also skyrocketed shoppers had stripped shops in late july in 
anticipation of the increases and august deliveries have been 
meager 
a report today in zycie warszawy an official daily in the 
capital said sales clerks hoped deliveries would improve in the 
next two to three days but the report added that farmers were 
still waiting for higher prices before delivering goods to market 
where is the meat cried out an old man in a store on 
tuesday 
there is no meat just the price list a woman complained 
in a speech to parliament today to present his economic plan 
before he was elected prime minister gen czeslaw kiszczak said 
drastic measures would have to be adopted to prevent the danger of 
economic destabilization 
solidarity lawmakers charge that the policies of the previous 
government of mieczyslaw f rakowski elected first secretary of 
the communist party over the weekend are responsible for the 
current economic chaos 
authorities said the increases are needed to prompt farmers to 
deliver their meat and produce to the market and to stabilize the 
level of state subsidies to the food industry 
price increases occur regularly in poland but the scale of the 
latest boost drove many customers to despair in the past major 
price increases on food have led to rioting in poland 
the price of pork roast an expensive and popular cut rose from 
118 to 464 a kilogram 22 pounds sugar went up from 42 cents 
to 60 cents a kilogram but was unavailable in many shops butter 
was up from 27 cents for a quarter kilogram to 48 cents flour 
increased from 7 cents a kilogram to 12 cents the average monthly 
income in poland is 127 
parliament on monday passed legislation designed to cushion 
consumers from the impact of price increases and inflation now 
rising at an estimated 160 percent rate annually 
the law calls for incomes of workers farmers and pensioners to 
be automatically conmpensated by 80 percent of the rise in the cost 
of living

delta airlines wont appeal a 399 award to 
mayor ed hendler who complained he wasnt allowed to smoke on a 
flight 
wed basically just like to forget about it delta spokesman 
jim lundy in atlanta said tuesday it would be more trouble and 
more expensive than its worth to go through the appeal process 
hendler sued delta after his march flight from salt lake city to 
washington dc was declared nonsmoking just before takeoff to 
accommodate two passengers 
in small claims court in pasco last month hendler was awarded 
the ticket price of 376 and 23 for court costs hendler 
originally sought three times the ticket price 
delta does not fear hendlers victory will inspire similar 
lawsuits and does not plan to change its policies lundy said 
federal law says airlines must provide a sufficient number of 
seats in the nosmoking sections of the aircraft for all persons 
who wish to be seated there and expansion of nosmoking areas to 
meet demand 
about 15 percent of deltas seats typically are for smokers 
lundy said the carrier occasionally cancels smoking sections but 
hendler was the first to sue lundy said 
hendler said that if the airline reserves seats for smokers it 
should honor that commitment the principle is breach of 
contract that is the basis of the suit he said

the senate struggling toward passage of a 
295 billion defense authorization bill voted today to pay for the 
war on drugs with an infusion of unspent dollars from government 
agencies including the pentagon 
the 909 vote taken as the senate worked into the early morning 
hours would authorize the transfer of 17 billion from all but a 
short list of exempted federal programs to pay the full cost of 
keeping the governments promise to fight the epidemic of 
narcotics sweeping this country 
sen robert c byrd dwva chairman of the senate 
appropriations committee said the action if approved by the house 
and enacted into law puts the problem of paying for the drug war 
squarely on president bushs shoulders 
this amendment authorizes the president to fund the drug 
package byrd said it says mr president when it passes 
into law its your baby you fund the war on drugs if you dont 
like it find another way 
in other action before adjourning at 250 am edt the senate 
voted to give air police lastresort permission to shoot down 
aircraft flying narcotics into the united states 
adopted a series of burdensharing amendments aimed at 
increasing the contributions to defense by us allies in europe 
and asia 
bolstered bushs bid to make the mx missile a moving rather 
than a stationary target by shelving 6238 an amendment slicing 
502 million from the funds available to place the force of 50 
missiles on railway cars 
turned aside an attempt to bring to an immediate vote an 
amendment restoring the military pension lost when former marine 
lt col oliver l north was convicted on three felony counts in 
the irancontra affair as a compromise it ordered the senate 
judiciary committee to hold hearings and report on the contentious 
issue by nov 1 
when the senate resumed consideration of the defense bill this 
morning lawmakers voted 5344 to turn aside an amendment that 
would earmark 100 million for the effective deployment of 100 
groundbased interceptors in grand forks nd by 1995 
the interceptors part of the accidental launch protection 
system would be used against sudden terrorist missile attacks 
the senate also voted 8413 to limit the number of amendments on 
the defense bill to those that are germane to the subject thus 
shortening debate 
lawmakers took that step after an amendment regarding tests of 
antisatellite systems was deemed not germane to the defense bill 
because of technical reasons 
after a rancorous debate earlier the senate declined to support 
an amendment to siphon 450 million from the authorization for the 
star wars strategic defense initiative for the war on drugs 
instead it approved the compromise drafted by sen sam nunn 
dga chairman of the senate armed forces committee as a 
desperation move to guarantee the drug war will be fully funded 
nunn said his amendment would keep the promises of the drug bill 
passed last year by shifting unspent balances in federal programs 
left over at the end of the fiscal year ending sept 30 
the measure exempts entitlement programs including social 
security medicare and subsidized housing but all other 
government programs and agencies would be compelled to contribute 
this is not the best way to fund the drug bill and i hope 
another way will be found nunn said but this will do the job 
this says before you spend money on other things youve got 
to fund the drug bill 
several senators complained that such popular programs as 
student aid and education for the handicapped would be sharply 
and severely cut by the amendment 
but sen joseph r biden ddel told the senate im a 
realist i know there is no way to get the money out of star wars 
i have no hesitation of choosing money for the war on drugs 
over student aid over any other thing in the entire budget 
biden rhetorically addressing bush complained the 
administration had not kept promises to fully fund the drug war 
youve given us cardboard cops youve given us cardboard 
prisons youve given us nothing mr president biden said 
adding that while bush has vowed not to increase taxes the 
american people want the drug war paid for no matter the cost 
voting against the amendment were sens bill bradley dnj 
mark hatfield rore james m jeffords rvt bennett johnston 
dla nancy kassebaum rkan edward kennedy dmass john 
kerry dmass frank r lautenberg dnj and james mcclure 
ridaho sen jim sasser dtenn did not vote because he had to 
leave for a family emergency 
in a flurry of early morning action the senate by voice vote 
adopted a series of amendments intended to press us allies into 
accepting a greater share of the defense burden 
one issues a warning to nato that the united states may reduce 
us troop strength in europe if the alliance unilaterally cuts its 
strength in the absence of negotiated troop reductions by the 
soviet union 
another calls on japan to boost defense and foreignaid spending 
and requires the president to negotiate an agreement providing for 
japan to completely offset the costs of maintaining us forces to 
defend japanese territory 
a third directs the president to prepare a fiveyear plan for 
the us military presence in south korea including a discussion 
of the feasibility and desirability of partial gradual 
reductions in us military personnel stationed there

women who try to reduce their risk of fractures 
and heart disease by taking estrogen supplements for many years 
after menopause may slightly increase their chances of breast 
cancer a study concludes 
some experts said doctors may have to consider the possibility 
of cancer when weighing the risks and benefits of putting women on 
estrogen after menopause however they caution that the evidence 
of a cancer link is still weak 
in my opinion the data are not conclusive enough to warrant 
any immediate change in the way we approach hormone replacement 
said dr elizabeth barrettconnor of the university of california 
san diego 
the study based on 23244 swedish women found that users had a 
10 percent overall increase in their risk of breast cancer after 
six years of taking the hormone 
however the risk varied depending on the kind of estrogen that 
women used those who took estradiol the most commonly used 
variety in sweden had nearly double the usual risk of breast 
cancer but the researchers found no increased risk among the 
relatively small numbers who used conjugated estrogens which are 
most frequently prescribed in the united states 
doctors often prescribe estrogen in combination with the hormone 
progestin in the belief that this will minimize any increase in the 
risk of uterine cancer which also is associated with estrogen use 
however the swedish study raised the possibility that this 
combination may actually heighten the risk of breast cancer 
women in the study who had used the combination for more than 
six years had four times the usual risk of breast cancer but the 
number of women studied was too small to be statistically 
meaningful 
this article raises concern about the new regimens noted 
dr lynn rosenberg of the sloan epidemiology unit at boston 
university combination therapy is becoming increasingly popular 
and recommended 
the study like other research found no danger from brief use 
of estrogen to relieve hot flashes and other symptoms during 
menopause 
the study was directed by dr leif bergkvist of university 
hospital in uppsala sweden and published in thursdays new 
england journal of medicine 
evidence of a link between estrogen and breast cancer is 
conflicting more than 20 studies have found no sign of an 
association but a few others suggest there may be a link 
estrogen is widely prescribed to older women to reduce their 
risk of heart disease and to stop osteoporosis which leads to 
broken bones some doctors recommended that women take the hormone 
for the rest of their lives 
this is an important public health question said dr 
charles hennekens of brigham and womens hospital in boston the 
breast cancer finding if confirmed would certainly be something 
that the physician would have to weigh in deciding whether to give 
estrogen

more than 200 black and indian 
patients supported by throngs of protesters were treated at 
segregated white hospitals today as the antiapartheid movement 
launched a nationwide defiance campaign 
the campaign in which other major protests are planned before 
and after next months segregated elections is seen as the most 
ambitious civil disobedience initiative in the country in nearly 30 
years 
the defiance campaign will be taken to every corner and every 
section of society until apartheid is unworkable said jay 
naidoo leader of the congress of south african trade unions the 
largest antiapartheid labor federation at a rally in johannesburg 
at major hospitals in johannesburg and durban patients ranging 
from babies to grandmothers in wheelchairs were admitted for 
treatment hospital officials trying to avoid confrontations said 
they would not turn away anyone who appeared in genuine need of 
medical care 
twelve white women supporting the protest were arrested in 
johannesburg but no violence was reported at any of the eight 
hospitals targeted by the mass democratic movement a coalition of 
antiapartheid groups that planned the defiance campaign 
murphy morobe a leader of the united democratic front south 
africas main antiapartheid alliance before it was banned last 
year told reporters the hospital protest is a major victory 
and praised doctors who cooperated 
in the port city of durban more than 1000 protesters staged an 
illegal demonstration near addington hospital while 140 blacks and 
indians under the direction of senior antiapartheid leaders were 
admitted for outpatient care apartheid makes us sick said 
one of the posters carried at the rally 
the first protester to enter addington was mariam jagga an 
elderly indian woman in a wheelchair 
by midday 48 blacks were admitted to johannesburg general 
hospital according to a spokesman and 100 supporters staged a 
rally at an adjoining medical school like addington johannesburg 
general regularly admits some blacks for emergency care and 
specialized treatment but it has a policy of transferring them to 
less wellequipped black hospitals as soon as feasible 
dr reg broekmann superintendent of johannesburg general said 
about 11 percent of his 830 current patients were black 
dasoo noted that the blacks were admitted within an hour at 
johannesburg general much quicker than the normal processing time 
at badly overcrowded baragwanath hospital in soweto the regions 
main facility for black patients 
the campaign that began today is widely viewed as the most 
ambitious in south africa since a sporadic but longrunning 
campaign in the 1950s to encourare defiance of apartheid laws 
those protests ended in march 1960 when police gunfire killed 
69 blacks participating in a peaceful demonstration against the 
nowabolished pass laws that restricted blacks freedom of movement 
antiapartheid groups have organized several oneday or twoday 
nationwide general strikes in recent years and a widespread hunger 
strike early this year by hundreds of detainees resulted in the 
release of virtually all of them 
hospital segregation however has never before been the target 
of coordinated protests 
the protests today were smaller or nonexistent at the six 
targeted hospitals outside johannesburg and durban activists said 
some wouldbe protesters were stopped at police roadblocks 
nine blacks were admitted to a white hospital in pretoria 15 in 
vereeniging and a few others in the conservative mining town of 
krugersdorp where medical segregation has been enforced firmly 
without intervention such as this these people wouldnt even 
get to see a doctor said audrey coleman a white activist who 
was at paardekraal 
protest organizers said their goal is not merely to enable some 
blacks to get treatment at the white hospitals but to abolish the 
use of race as a criterion for obtaining health care 
dasoo said he and his colleagues would protest most strongly 
if blacks admitted to johannesburg general today were transferred 
to segregated black hospitals later 
large contingents of police were deployed at the targeted 
hospitals and 12 white women of the black sash civil rights group 
were arrested in johannesburg while staging an outdoor 
demonstration protesting segregated hospitals 
they later were released and police said a decision would be 
made whether they would be charged with violating laws restricting 
outdoor protests

the boeing co halfway through a record year 
opened contract talks today with union leaders who say they want a 
wage increase to replace all or some of the productivity bonuses of 
the past six years 
negotiations between boeing and the machinists union which 
represents 57800 workers in seattle wichita kan and portland 
ore began by tradition in wichita 
all we want is our fair share said ron eldridge a 
machinists business representative in wichita 
aerospace industry analysts say the union is in a strong 
position because of a 67 billion backlog of commercial airplane 
orders 346 million in profits in the first half of 1989 and a 
shortage of skilled workers that forced boeing to borrow 600 
lockheed corp employees earlier this year 
analysts said the chance of a strike is small among boeing 
workers 
this is the opportunity of a lifetime to get all the overtime 
they can said william deatherage analyst at dean witter 
reynolds inc in new york 
union officials say they want a wage increase likely to be in 
the doubledigits to replace all or some of the yearly bonuses 
that have ranged from 3 percent to 12 percent since 1983 the 
current threeyear contract expires oct 3 
except for welders the people who make boeing planes earn 888 
to 1842 an hour the average wage is 1350 to 14 an hour 
all the signals are that it looks good for us boeing can well 
afford to pay an increase in wages and increase benefits said 
machinists union district 751 president tom baker of seattle 
boeing spokesman paul binder refused to comment on the 
negotiations

a black priest today announced that he has 
joined suspended black priest rev george a stallings in setting 
up an africanamerican catholic congregation 
stallings who has criticized the catholic church for not 
meeting the needs of its multiethnic congregation said the rev 
bruce greening would assist him as a minister and in forming a 
school at the monthold imani temple 
what is happening at imani temple is in my opinion the right 
method to take said greening who is assigned to the catholic 
diocese of richmond i would like to challenge other black 
priests and other black sisters to do the same 
richmond bishop walter f sullivan issued a statement saying he 
regrets father greenings decision to join imani temple 
by the very fact of his free decision father greening 
automatically disassociates himself from the diocese of richmond 
said sullivan i am relieving him of his duties as principal of 
st marys academy in norfolk effective immediately 
julie sulik spokeswoman of the diocese said sullivan does not 
have the authority to suspend greening from that diocese because he 
is assigned to the society of the divine saviour in milwaukee wis 
greening was working at the norfolk school on a trial basis until 
he decided whether he wanted to remain there sulik said 
milwaukee church officials could not be reached for comment 
stallings said the congregation of the imani temple would be 
meeting aug 19 to discuss the issues they feel should be at the 
forefront of the churchs agenda 
we are going to make sure that when we do deal with those 
issues they are going to be embraced by the people not handed 
down stallings said 
were going to look at teenage pregnancy and the drug 
epidemic in our community he said we see these issues as 
being systematic of greater issues in our society other 
priorities for the black community were unemployment and education 
stallings said 
he also said the imani temple has received several requests from 
other cities to help them establish an africanamerican 
congregation there 
stallings said although he has his eye set on certain cities he 
felt would respond enthusiastically he first wanted to set the 
groundwork for the mother church

a un envoy arrived in south lebanon 
today to try to find the body of us marine lt col william r 
higgins who reportedly was hanged by his shiite moslem captors 
another american hostage was given a reprieve 
the envoy marrack goulding said he also would work on winning 
freedom for other hostages in lebanon 
the proiranian organization of the oppressed on earth said it 
killed higgins on monday in retaliation for israels refusal to 
free sheik abdul karim obeid a shiite moslem cleric kidnapped by 
israeli commandos july 28 
israels defense minister yitzhak rabin today defended the 
abduction and said the government considered the dangers to 
hostages in lebanon before approving it 
rabin also said interrogation of obeid revealed he played a 
central role in higgins abduction 
after talks with president bush pope john paul ii agreed to 
intervene to seek the return to the united states of higgins body 
the revolutionary justice organization which holds american 
hostage joseph cicippio said it would kill cicippio on tuesday at 
11 am edt unless israel had freed obeid it then extended the 
deadline 48 hours 
shiite sources in lebanon speaking on condition they not be 
further identified said today they believed iran may have stepped 
in to save cicippio because of the international uproar over 
higgins reported hanging 
the organization of the oppressed on earth released a crude 
videotape monday purportedly showing higgins hanging but there was 
no way of knowing when the tape was made 
rabin said today israel had unconfirmed reports higgins was 
killed months ago 
goulding the un undersecretarygeneral in charge of 
peacekeeping stopped in israel en route to lebanon and told 
reporters my mission is to find out what happened to col 
higgins and to see what can be done to bring about the release of 
the other hostages 
higgins 44 was commander of an observer team attached to the 
un interim force in lebanon when he was kidnapped feb 17 1988 
goulding flew to unifils lebanon headquarters in the border 
town of naqoura and went into immediate talks with the unifil 
commander maj gen larseric wahlgren 
goulding was scheduled to visit beirut on thursday and meet with 
lebanese leaders including some shiites unifil spokesman timur 
goksel refused to name the leaders 
there are no negotiations involved although he has a 
secondary mission of trying to find out about other hostages in 
lebanon goksel said 
in announcing the extension for cicippio the revolutionary 
justice organization acknowledged a plea from cicippios lebanese 
wife elham and cited friendly appeals and sincere behests 
the iranians probably are bringing immense pressure on their 
lebanese surrogates seeking to defuse the crisis generated by 
higgins murder one shiite source in lebanon said speaking on 
condition he not be identified 
iran is the financial and spiritual backer of hezbollah or 
party of god the fundamentalist faction believed to be the 
umbrella for groups holding most of the 16 foreign hostages in 
lebanon 
the shiite source noted that revolutionary justice has used 
death threats in the past to back political demands but never has 
killed a hostage 
even if it was a postponement for only one minute its better 
than nothing said elham cicippio who married cicippio after he 
converted to islam in 1985 
cicippio 58 was acting comptroller of the american university 
of beirut when he was kidnapped sept 12 1986 
the statement announcing the reprieve was accompanied by a 
photograph of another american hostage edward austin tracy 58 a 
selfstyled wanderer and writer kidnapped oct 21 1986 it was the 
first picture of him released since march 8 
there are four other americans among the foreigners held in 
lebanon the hostage held longest is terry anderson chief middle 
east correspondent for the associated press he was kidnapped march 
16 1985 
rabin today repeated israels offer to swap obeid and lebanese 
shiite moslem prisoners held in israel for israeli soldiers and the 
foreigners held in lebanon 
hezbollah of which obeid is reported to be a leader has 
rejected a swap 
rabin said obeid admitted under interrogation that higgins 
three abductors were at his home in south lebanon the night before 
the kidnap he quoted obeid as saying the kidnappers car was 
hidden in his garage for a month 
earlier reports said higgins was held for two days in obeids 
house 
rabin said the kidnap of obeid was approved two months ago 
after every grain of possibility for dialogue had been 
exhausted on winning the release of three israeli pows captured in 
south lebanon 
we took into consideration all the possible reactions he 
said we saw them all including the actions that already took 
place and ones even worse 
energy minister moshe shahal later told the associated press 
however that the decision to approve the kidnap did not rest on 
outside implications consideration was only given to getting our 
soldiers back he said 
the soviet news agency tass said irans presidentelect hashemi 
rafsanjani discussed the obeid abduction and higgins purported 
death with soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze in tehran 
tass said rafsanjani voiced deep regret over what has happened 
and confirmed that iran does not have any relation to the tragedy 
it said both men favored urgent measures to prevent the 
situation from worsening 
irans main opposition group the mujahedeen khalq claimed 
today rafsanjani directly controls the groups holding hostages and 
that he dispatched his brother to help oversee their activities 
including the execution of higgins

a piedmont airlines jet carrying 100 
people made an emergency landing with its left wing and engine 
scraping the runway today after its landing gear jammed officials 
said no injuries were reported 
a flash of flame and smoke erupted from the left wing as the 
jet a new boeing 737 en route to charlotte from washington 
touched down at piedmont triad international airport about 1055 
am with its left landing gear up 
passengers slid down emergency chutes and ground crews sprayed 
foam on the engine 
i was thinking that this might be it said a passenger pam 
schaeffer of washington she said she sat next to a former flight 
attendant who kept her informed of what the crew was doing once 
i was out of the plane and on the runway and far from the plane i 
started to feel ok 
flight 1489 carrying 94 passengers and a crew of six was to 
have landed at charlotte at 930 am the airline said 
the plane was diverted to greensboro the site of piedmonts 
maintenance hangar after the instrument panel indicated the 
landing gear had not locked officials said the landing was 
carried live by a statewide tv network of six stations 
the pilot circled for better than an hour in an attempt to get 
all the gear down said federal aviation administration spokesman 
roger myers the pilot got the nose wheel and right landing gear 
down but not the left gear myers said 
emergency vehicles lined the runway awaiting the landing and 
the airport closed to other traffic airline spokesman david 
shipley said the pilot burned off most of his fuel to reduce the 
risk of fire he said there was not enough time to foam the runway 
beforehand 
before landing the pilot touched the plane down briefly to test 
its landing gear and that indicated the nose wheel and right 
landing gear were locked in proper position said piedmont 
spokeswoman nancy vaughan 
the national transportation safety board will investigate to 
determine the cause of the malfunction myers said 
passenger debbie mcdorman of washington said the crew notified 
passengers of the problem around 945 am and began maneuvering to 
free the stuck landing gear 
they would drop and circle a couple of times to try and shake 
it free or shake from side to side ms mcdorman said its a 
really weird feeling 
she said passengers were calm 
i kind of kidded around in the beginning and then i got really 
scared when they started doing the maneuvers i said this is 
getting serious she said but she said she believed the landing 
would come off without difficulty 
i know that any pilot thats worth his salt can land an 
aircraft without wheels she said 
shipley said that the plane was manufactured in november 1988 
airline records show no maintenance problems with the plane or the 
737400 series of which it is a part he said

austrian conductor herbert von karajan was 
under investigation by the justice department over allegations of 
involvement in nazi persecution but the case against him was 
dropped when he died last month a government lawyer said wednesday 
had he lived there might have been a question of the 
watchlist putting the famed musician on a list of people banned 
from the united states for their nazi pasts said neal m sher who 
heads the justice departments office of special investigations 
among the allegations were that von karajan might have worked 
for the nazi security police and had a role in ridding german 
orchestras of jews and other nonaryans said sher 
the investigation was begun several months ago before von 
karajan died in austria on july 16 at the age of 81 sher said 
we were looking at what his role in nazi persecution might 
have been said sher i dont know where the investigation 
would have led but there might have been a question of the 
watchlist 
thousands of people have been placed on the list including 
austrian president kurt waldheim the office investigated him in 
1986 and reached a finding that played a role in nazi persecution 
during world war ii while he served as an intelligence officer 
von karajan joined the fledgling nazi party in 1933 in austria 
and then rejoined in 1934 when he moved to germany sher said 
under the sponsorship of hermann goering the field marshal who 
founded the gestapo von karajans career flourished 
he was the cultural showpiece of the most horrendous regime 
ever at the time they were throwing people in the ovens he was 
holding concerts sher said 
to say von karajan was just an artist is a revisionist view of 
history sher said 
for two years after the war ended in 1945 von karajan was banned 
from performing by the allied powers who occupied germany because 
of his collaboration with the nazis his first tour of the united 
states in 1954 at the head of the berlin philharmonic which he 
conducted for 34 years was greeted by widespread protests 
von karajan was a frequent visitor to the united states the 
last time in february sher said 
there were many questions about him that deserved answers 
but with his death the case has been closed he said

more than 200 blacks and 
asians were treated at whitesonly hospitals wednesday as the 
antiapartheid movement launched its most ambitious civil 
disobedience campaign in nearly 30 years 
patients ranging from babies to grandmothers in wheelchairs were 
admitted for treatment most of them at hospitals in durban and 
johannesburg hospital officials trying to avoid confrontations 
did not turn away anyone who appeared in genuine need of medical 
care 
we see the campaign today as a major victory said murphy 
morobe a leader of the mass democratic movement a loosely 
organzied coalition of antiapartheid groups that arranged the 
protests 
we proved that we did not intend to cause violence or disrupt 
medical services but to help the government remove the albatross 
of apartheid he said at a news conference 
morobe said the campaign will include other major protests 
before next months segregated parliamentary elections but refused 
to say what form they would take or when they would begin 
the government claims the campaign is part of an effort to 
violently disrupt the sept 6 elections for the tricameral 
parliament which has separate chambers for whites asians and 
people of mixed race but excludes the 28 million black majority 
the mass democratic movement has accused authorities of a 
hysterical response and has pledged that its actions will be 
nonviolent 
the last sustained defiance campaigns were conducted in the 
1950s and ended in march 1960 when police shot and killed 69 blacks 
participating in a peaceful protest against the nowabolished pass 
laws that restricted blacks freedom of movement 
antiapartheid groups have organized several one and twoday 
nationwide general strikes in recent years and a widespread hunger 
strike earlier this year by hundreds of detainees resulted in the 
release of virtually all of them 
organizers said the new campaign would last indefinitely 
the defiance campaign will be taken to every corner and every 
section of society until apartheid is unworkable said jay 
naidoo general secretary of the congress of south african trade 
unions the nations largest labor federation 
twelve white women supporting wednesdays protest were arrested 
briefly in johannesburg but no violence was reported at any of the 
eight targeted hospitals 
in durban more than 1000 protesters staged an illegal 
demonstration near addington hospital while about 140 blacks and 
indians under the direction of senior antiapartheid leaders were 
admitted for outpatient treatment apartheid makes us sick 
said one poster carried at the rally 
the first protester to enter addington was mariam jagga an 
elderly indian woman in a wheelchair 
at johannesburg general hospital about 50 blacks were admitted 
for treatment and hundreds of supporters staged a rally at an 
adjoining medical school 
like addington johannesburg general regularly admits some 
blacks for emergency care and specialized treatment but has a 
policy of transferring them to less wellequipped black hospitals 
as soon as feasible 
dr reg broekmann superintendent of johannesburg general said 
about 11 percent of his 830 patients were black 
johannesburg generals occupancy is about 50 percent while the 
only fullservice hospital in the soweto township outside 
johannesburg is so overcrowded that hundreds of patients sleep on 
the floors 
as of today the mass democratic movement considers all health 
facilities in south africa open to all races said aslam dasoo 
a doctor who helped organize the protest 
the protests were smaller at the six targeted hospitals outside 
johannesburg and durban activists said some wouldbe protesters 
were stopped at police roadblocks 
in related developments 
seventeen activists in cape town announced that on sunday they 
will begin defying restrictions imposed on them following their 
recent release from detention like many exdetainees they are 
required to remain in their homes at night and to report daily to 
police 
the national union of mineworkers said its members are 
attempting to use facilities reserved for whites including 
bathrooms cafeterias and buses 
under apartheid the 5 million whites control the countrys 
political system and the economy and maintain segregated 
neighborhoods and schools

attorney general dick thornburgh urged a 
senate panel wednesday to ratify an international antidrug 
trafficking treaty 
the pact will provide us with enhanced law enforcement tools 
and can lead to substantial advances in our international 
cooperative efforts to counter the illegal drug market 
thornburgh told the senate foreign relations committee 
the attorney general signed the un convention against illicit 
traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances on behalf of 
the united states last december in vienna 
the treaty includes a provision under which all the nations 
signing the convention have agreed to exchange evidence of criminal 
conduct and to extradite accused traffickers so that safe havens 
are no longer so readily available he said 
however thornburgh noted in response to questions from chairman 
claiborne pell dri that the treaty does not obligate countries 
to extradite their own nationals wanted on drugrelated charges in 
other countries 
the convention in and of itself is not going to provide a 
remedy to the extradition problem of colombia where the supreme 
court several years ago declared unconstitutional its extradition 
treaty with the united states that allowed drug traffickers to 
remain there when they were wanted on charges in the united states 
he said 
in addition thornburgh told sen joseph r biden jr ddel 
that the treaty would allow the united states to withhold 
investigative information from governments it perceives to be 
corrupt even if they have signed the document 
i think we would have no hesitation about doing that 
thornburgh said our obligation to our own citizens would 
transcend the treaty requirement to share information 
thornburgh said the president would decide whether the united 
states should seek extradition of someone overseas wanted on drug 
charges here when the state department doesnt want that to occur 
i have not had such a case arise thornburgh told biden 
the obvious instinct of a prosecutor is to prosecute 
however all of us recognize the prosecutions may have to be 
foregone for national security reasons 
mel levitsky assistant secretary of state for international 
narcotics matters attended the hearing but did not comment 
panamanian gen manuel antonio noriega was indicted by two 
federal grand juries on drugtrafficking charges in florida last 
year before thornburgh became attorney general the state 
department reportedly offered to drop the criminal charges against 
noriega if he would step down from power in panama 
the treaty calls for extradition of accused drug traffickers and 
the exchange of law enforcement information it also seeks to lift 
the veil of bank secrecy to help uncover moneylaundering 
operations requires supervision of the manufacturing and sale of 
chemicals used in the production of illegal drugs mandates that 
commercial carriers ensure their cargos are free of drugs and 
reaffirms the need for aggressive efforts in crop eradication and 
demand reduction thornburgh said 
the agreement requires each signatory to pass laws outlawing 
drug trafficking and money laudering while enabling the countries 
to seize drug profits but the laws of each country would take 
precedence 
thornburgh noted that all legislation by each country is 
subject to their constitutional principles and basic concepts of 
their legal systems 
the treaty thornburgh said will assist in the eradication of 
drugs and drugproducing laboratories and in preventing the 
transportation of precursor chemicals from this nation and others 
to the drugproducing countries for use in drug production 
the convention will also help to hinder the importation of 
drugs into the united states and prevent the transfer of the 
profits of the illegal drug trade back to the drug cartels he 
said

education secretary lauro f cavazos got a 
cool reception from a house committee chairman wednesday when he 
sought support for proposals emphasizing parental involvement that 
he said are needed to revitalize school systems 
although initiatives outlined by cavazos have been embraced in 
principle by the senate education panel and the house 
appropriations committee rep augustus f hawkins dcalif made 
clear he was not impressed 
hawkins chairman of the education and labor committee told 
cavazos he sees some dangerous trends in the proposals being 
advocated 
for example he characterized what he called a socalled 
parental choice approach to school selection for their children 
as a very dangerous idea that has not been fully scrutinized 
on the administration proposal to encourage a new category of 
magnet schools targeted at school systems with major dropout and 
drug abuse problems hawkins said that takes us far afield from 
trying to improve schools for all children rather than a few 
the selling of choice reminds me of the medicine man selling 
snake oil said hawkins 
the veteran committee chairman has been a major force in most of 
the federal education legislation passed in recent years 
cavazos said 
we have been aware of problems for a long time but nothing 
has happened we have got to start changing the system itself what 
im trying to do is open up to this nation the whole idea of 
restructuring our education system and i think choice is a major 
part of that 
in his prepared testimony cavazos had said the fact that we 
now outspend most countries in education does not in any way make 
up for the fact that when it comes to solid results our students 
and our schools overall simply arent cutting it 
while not disputing committee figures that the federal share of 
education spending has dropped from 8 percent to 6 percent over the 
past decade cavazos said inflationadjusted spending by all levels 
of government is up 26 percent since 1982 to 199 billion last 
year on elementary and secondary education alone 
outlining the federal role as mainly one of stimulating 
education approaches with the best chance of working cavazos said 
we have not made progress by putting in more money we need to 
totally change the system we just cannot go on doing it the way we 
are doing it now 
rep dale e kildee dmich said he was concerned about many 
administration proposals because i think what were talking about 
is reversing our commitment to desegregation 
while not attacking cavazos proposals specifically kildee 
cited the senate judiciary committees rejection tuesday of william 
lucas of detroit for the top civil rights job at the justice 
department as the senate reading signs in the executive and 
judicial branch of a general relaxation of devotion to civil rights 
this a great worry to congress said kildee 
the main program in the proposed legislation that drew hawkins 
criticism would authorize 100 million a year to promote what 
cavazos called open enrollment through parental choice as a new 
category of magnet schools that would not necessarily be intended 
to promote desegregation or attract only top scholars 
magnet schools work said cavazos and george bush and i 
want to find ways to expand magnet schools and other examples of 
choice all across this country 
the legislation also would enable the education department to 
study other choice programs and recommend those that work best 
the secretary complimented hawkins home state and said 
several models of choice are being implemented in california 
including schoolswithinaschool and special schools with a 
subject matter focus interdistrict choice is allowed if both 
school districts involved agree

a former tamil rebel leader traveled 
to new delhi on wednesday to help negotiate an accord on 
withdrawing indian peacekeeping troops from sri lanka 
in new delhi a government spokesman said foreign minister 
ranjan wijeratne of sri lanka met with indian prime minister rajiv 
gandhi for two hours 
the spokesman said the former tamil rebel vartharaja perumal 
and five other ethnic tamils from sri lanka would be in new delhi 
on thursday for consultations but would not take part in the talks 
perumal is chief minister of the northeastern provincial council in 
sri lanka 
on this island off indias southern coast more ethnic violence 
was reported in central and southern sri lanka sinhalese 
extremists have killed seven people since tuesday military sources 
said 
sinhalese radicals have carried out an antiindia campaign to 
protest the presence of about 45000 indian peacekeepers in the 
tamildominated north and east 
in colombo fire destroyed 25 shops owned by tamils of indian 
descent police said no casualties were reported from the tuesday 
night fire the cause of which was under investigation 
wijeratne and a sixmember delegation came to new delhi on 
saturday to discuss a timetable for the pullout of the troops they 
were deployed under a failed 1987 peace accord sponsored by india 
india says more power must be transferred to the tamildominated 
provincial council to fulfill the terms of the 1987 accord before 
its troops leave 
sinhalese extremists say the indian troops have compromised this 
countrys independence they also say the government in colombo has 
granted too many concessions to the tamils 
the government has blamed the extremists for killing at least 
4000 people mostly officials of the government and its 
supporters about 11000 other people have died in the tamil 
insurrection that began in 1983 
in an effort to quell the violence president ranasinghe 
premadasas government asked india to withdraw its soldiers by july 
29 
on saturday india pulled out a small number of troops and the 
two countries agreed to negotiate a withdrawal for the remaining 
soldiers 
the tamil guerrillas are fighting for an independent homeland in 
the north and east 
india became involved because its own 60 million tamils are 
sympathetic to the demands of sri lankan tamils who account for 18 
percent of this countrys 16 million people 
tamils contend they are discriminated against in jobs and 
education by the sinhalese who make up 75 percent of the 
population and control the government and the military

a jury today ruled that home shopping 
network libeled gte corp in blaming the telephone equipment 
company for lost sales and it awarded gte 100 million 
hsn had charged that gte didnt give it adequate equipment to 
handle a large volume of calls in 1986 and 1987 as the tv network 
expanded into 11 new markets but the sixmember circuit court jury 
disagreed 
the jury awarded 50 million each to gte florida and gte 
communications after five hours of deliberations the jury said 20 
million should by paid by hsn and 40 million apiece by its 
chairman and its president 
hsn which offers items for sale to tv viewers had sued in 
1987 claiming it lost millions of telephone calls and about 500 
million in potential sales because its gte equipment was 
insufficient for the volume of calls 
gete based in stamford conn countered with a slander and 
libel suit blaming hsns troubles on its own mismanagement 
gte lawyer roy reardon said hsn had failed to mention its plans 
to buy 11 uhf stations in 1986 which combined with its entry into 
the cable tv market caused subscribers to soar from 9 million to 
465 million in one year 
competition from similar retailers also hurt hsn reardon said

parliament on wednesday approved 1 billion in 
emergency funds to battle algae that is fouling beaches on the 
adriatic coast and driving tourists away 
part of the money will be used to build water purifiers and 
sewage treatment plants along the coast and to reduce the amount of 
agricultural pollutants coming from the po river 
the decree approved by the senate earlier this month passed 
the chamber of deputies by a 32019 vote with 17 legislators 
abstaining 
the algae has dealt a serious blow to the adriatic tourism 
industry creating a dirty sea and deserted beaches the federation 
of italian hotel and tour operators has predicted that the 1989 
seasons losses could total 197 million and the number of tourists 
could fall 30 percent from last summer 
the enviromentalist greens party voted against the decree 
criticizing the funds as insufficient

rock star billy joel says he no longer cares for 
his early 1970s cult hit captain jack or his popular song my 
life which he describes as childishly redundant 
my life is a song that turned out sour for me just 
like some of your kids turn into bums he told a master class at 
the performing arts center of long island universitys southampton 
campus on monday 
captain jack a song about adolescent drug abuse kind of 
burned me out quick he added 
the master class was open to the public and included art 
garfunkel joel made it clear his professional career not his 
private life was the topic of the day 
usually somebody wants to know what does christie look like 
in the morning he said referring to his wife model christie 
brinkley she looks good so lets get that out of the way 
joel said he writes his music first composing the melody to 
what he called bailout lyrics that establish a songs phrasing 
as he was working on the first verse of just the way you 
are he said the lyrics went 
dont be crazy dont be lazy 
dont bring me chicken soup alone 
im not hungry im not thirsty 
later when he wrote the real words joel said he thought the 
phrase what will it take til you believe in me the way that i 
believe in you was essential to its success 
that edge of anxiety made it a more meaningful song he said 
joel who signed a contract as a young musician that gave away 
his rights to his early songs said his advice to newcomers to the 
field was to get a lawyer 
then id tell them to hire another lawyer to watch the first 
lawyer 
theres a great deal of dishonesty and greed and musicians 
tend to be naive about this business he said

general electric co has agreed to hold back 
up to 300000 pounds of ozonedepleting freon to offset the release 
of the gas from a refrigerator repair program it was announced 
wednesday 
sen albert gore dtenn who negotiated with ge officials 
said the arrangement was breaking new ground because it would 
mean real reductions in the volume of cfcs chlorofluorocarbons 
now being released into our air 
jim allen a spokesman for ges appliance division in 
louisville ky said he expected the offset would take place next 
year after completion of the program to replace compressors in 
nearly a million largesize refrigerators sold in 198788 
ge is replacing the compressors which drive the coolant system 
in customers homes but during that process about five ounces of 
freon are released the freon joins other cfcs in floating towards 
the stratosphere where the chemicals can destroy the paperthin 
ozone layer 
while ozone is the chief ingredient of smog when close to the 
ground it protects against ultraviolet radiation at higher levels 
if a hole in the ozone layer develops and increased radiation comes 
through it could cause more cases of skin cancer and eye 
cataracts depressed human immune systems and reduced crop yields 
according to scientists and the environmental protection agency 
cfcs also have been implicated in global warming in which the 
earths heat is trapped causing temperature increases droughts 
heat waves and a rise in sea levels 
gore has introduced legislation to reduce and eventually ban 
ozonedepleting chemicals which already are headed for a 50 
percent worldwide reduction by the end of the century under an 
international agreement 
allen the ge spokesman said the company hasnt decided exactly 
how to offset the releases caused by repairs but added that the 
firm has pledged to take off the marketplace the amount we use in 
the replacement program 
he said the company initiated the replacement program 
voluntarily in january after testing showed that certain 
compressors would not last the required 10 years 
gore and an official of an environmental research group told a 
news conference that ge could have done more by using special 
equipment to recapture the freon during repairs instead of 
releasing it into the atmosphere 
we are deeply disappointed by the companys refusal to stop 
routine releases of cfcs william walsh of the us public 
interest group said in a letter to ge walsh also was involved in 
the negotiations 
allen said portable machines that could recapture the freon on 
the spot are not widely available and are unable to recycle the gas 
during the repair process 
the negotiations with ge began after lynda draper of ellicott 
city md complained when the freon was released in her kitchen 
i was totally outraged she said draper said she contacted 
the public interest group after calls to ge brought no satisfactory 
response the public interest organization then contacted gore

flames pushed within 300 yards of the rustic 
sourdough lodge and theatened two idaho hamlets wednesday but 
cooler weather was turning the tide against some of the wildfires 
buring in five western states 
it all depends on the wind said sourdough owner bob ahern 
who refused to leave his inn outside lowman if we dont get any 
wind we could walk away from this thing heads high if the wind 
changes my friend this is going to be one big black hole 
wildfires have consumed more than 215000 acres or 335 square 
miles of timber brush and grassland in the west since the middle 
of last week according to the boise interagency fire center the 
governments wildfire command post most were ignited by lightning 
big fires continued to burn wednesday in idaho and oregon while 
smaller blazes were fought in california montana and washington 
in idaho and oregon moist cool air slowed the flames advance 
those conditions really help suppression boise national 
forest spokeswoman lynette davis said but then its supposed to 
get hotter again by the weekend so weve got to get something done 
before then 
more than 15000 firefighters were on the lines throughout the 
west and reinforcements continued to arrive from outside the 
region and from the military 
fifteen buses carrying 500 soldiers left the armys fort lewis 
on wesdnesday to join the battle in eastern oregon the soldiers 
who got a crash course in fire safety were to be joined by 500 
more troops thursday said capt don herzog spokesman for the fort 
south of tacoma wash 
in idaho where 94000 acres of timber and range have burned 
crews had to concentrate on protecting structures scattered 
throughout the boise payette and nez perce national forests rather 
than on containing the flames 
they save the structures first and fight the fires second 
ms davis said 
air tankers were dumping flameretardant chemicals at a rate of 
onequarter of a million gallons of retardant a day on the most 
stubborn of the blazes 
lowman population 15 was largely leveled by flames over the 
weekend and shifting winds wednesday renewed the threat to cabins 
scattered near the town 70 miles northeast of boise 
ahern at the sourdough lodge was one of the few to ignore the 
forest service advice to leave fire crews poured so much soaplike 
foam on the building that it took on a midwinter snowy look even 
the tops of the surrounding firs were white 
the fire was so hot it melted asphalt on the highway idaho 21 
east and west of lowman 
fire also neared the small mining town of warren 120 miles 
north of boise where 16 of the 36 residents fled and the rest 
prepared to move to an open area if the threat increased 
hundreds of firefighters ringed the town with 1000 feet of 
hose putting sprinklers on each building as wind sent the fire 
racing to within a mile of the buildings 
the situation wednesday elsewhere in the west 
in eastern oregon where 85000 acres have been blackened 
cool weather gave firefighters hope they could turn back several 
big timber and range blazes said us forest service spokeswoman 
wendy evans in portland 
several smaller blazes were contained and the spread of the 
bigger fires around the towns of john day baker and enterprise had 
stopped she said 
in california a brush fire in the cleveland national forest 
that has blackened 8200 acres destroyed a house and a mobile home 
was 50 percent contained wednesday more than 1300 firefighters 
supperted by air tankers and helicopters struggled in sporadic wind 
and tough terrain to contain the blaze 90 miles southeast of los 
angeles 
in the sierra nevada foothills in central california 3000acre 
fire burned out of control in grass and brush but didnt pose a 
theat to structures 
in montana firefighters were close to containing an 800acre 
grass and timber fire in the custer national forest about 300 
firefighters were working to cut lines around the blaze in the 
southeastern corner of the state 
in washington firefighters were mopping up the 850acre

the house passed legislation on wednesday that 
would boost federal aids spending to 16 billion but block a 
survey of americans sexual habits that supporters said would help 
determine how such diseases spread 
the measure passed 36558 and sent to the senate increases 
aids spending in fiscal 1990 which begins oct 1 by about 25 
percent over this years level the money would be spread among 
research prevention and treatment programs 
but the report accompanying the bill prohibited the public 
health service from spending 11 million it had planned to use for 
an extensive study of sexual behavior 
there was no debate on the prohibition of the survey which was 
included by the house appropriations labor health and human 
services and education subcommittee but the report said the survey 
does not appear to be an appropriate use of federal funds and 
said such work if needed should be accomplished with private 
money 
the public health service is directed not to proceed with this 
study the report said 
the provisions were part of a bill providing 1552 billion for 
labor health and education programs 
public health officials said the sexual behavior study would 
allow them to learn more about how aids and other sexually 
transmitted diseases are spread the kinsey report conducted in 
1948 was the last thorough study of american sexual practices 
a pilot questionnaire composed by the health service sought to 
learn when participants had most recently had sex what practices 
they engaged in and whether their partner was male or female 
some bush administration officials and conservative lawmakers 
have opposed the survey arguing that it would be an invasion of 
privacy and that it is already clear that aids is spread through 
sexual contact 
last month the number of americans diagnosed as having aids 
surpassed the 100000 mark more than 58000 of them have died 
the legislation contains a large increase for the national 
institutes of health which would get a 534 million increase over 
1989 levels to 77 billion this includes 17 billion for cancer 
research and 11 billion for work on heart and lung ailments 
it provides 47 billion for jobs programs 19 billion for 
alcohol drug abuse and mental health programs and 56 billion 
for education programs for disadvantaged students 
it also grants 37 billion to the guaranteed student loan 
program for college students of that amount 19 billion is for 
the costs of loans on which students have defaulted

the smog over western montana valleys 
wednesday was so unusual that the national weather service put out 
a special advisory explaining to puzzled montanans what the crud 
was 
visibility in helena was only six miles wednesday morning 
virtually opaque by montana standards tuesday afternoon the 
visibility was 40 miles 
the weather service explained that the dirty air was a weather 
phenomenon usually seen in the industrial eastern united states 
generally speaking high humdity high pressure at the surface 
and a high concentration of industrial pollutants combine in the 
populated eastern united states to produce a milky dirty sky during 
the day along with reduced visibilities the weather service said 
in an advisory that goes to subscribers such as radio stations or 
newspapers 
smoke from idaho forest fires drifted northeast and combined 
with unusually humid and stagnant air over the mountains to bring a 
touch of east coast to the mountains 
the weather service said morning smog was expected to continue 
as long as the forest fires continue in idaho and as long as the 
westerly upper level winds continue to bring the smoke into 
montana

in the minutes before a delta jet crashed on 
takeoff last august the crew joked that a plane wreck would one 
day expose their gleeful cockpit conversation to the public 
the tape made by the cockpit voice recorder on flight 1141 was 
released under a judges order tuesday revealing crew members 
views on news coverage of other crashes jesse jacksons politics 
and marilyn quayles looks the conversation involved the cabin 
crew and a flight attendant who was forbidden by law to be in the 
cabin while the plane was in motion 
fourteen people were killed in the crash at dallasfort worth 
international airport more than 90 passengers survived 
at a hearing in november national transportation safety board 
investigators rigorously questioned the crew about the apparent 
idle nature of the conversation when they should have been going 
over preflight checklists 
district judge adolph canales released the tape over objections 
of a delta air lines lawyer who argued the recording should be made 
available only to parties in liability suits stemming from the 
crash of the boeing 727 delta already has admitted that the flight 
crew failed to properly set wing flaps for added lift before 
takeoff 
the nearly 10 minutes of conversation deemed casual and 
nonduty related and kept secret by the ntsb was released at the 
request of wfaatv 
the only female voice on the recording was identified by a 
special court master as that of flight attendant mary oneill who 
survived the crash 
some of the talk apparently took place while the plane was 
taxiing 
since 1981 the federal aviation administration has had a 
sterile cockpit rule that prohibits any flight crew 
conversation not related to the operation of the aircraft when the 
plane is taxiing and when it is flying below 10000 feet in an 
approach or departure flight attendants also are prohibited from 
entering the cockpit during those periods 
henry a duffy president of the air line pilots association 
today backed off a threat to have pilots turn off voice recorders 
until congress bars release of the recordings 
duffy said at a news conference that he received assurances the 
faa and ntsb will seek such legislation 
prior to the news conference duffy said if immediate and 
direct action is not taken i will be instructing our members 
to deactivate their recording devices until this shameful abuse is 
corrected 
faa spokesman john leyden said turning off the recorders would 
violate faa rules he said the faa has an agreement with pilots 
that no enforcement action will be taken as a result of what is 
said on the tapes 
they are only an investigative tool leyden said 
while the delta flight crew waited for takeoff an unidentified 
crew member said we forgot to discuss about the dating habits of 
our flight attendants so we could get it on the recorder in case we 
crashed 
then the media would have some kind of a juicy tidbit the 
crew member said 
that was a reference to continental crew members who were said 
to have discussed a flight attendants dating habits before their 
jet crashed on takeoff in denver in 1987 killing 28 people 
delta last week accepted responsibility for the crash it also 
announced it had fired the flights pilot copilot and flight 
engineer 
delta spokesman bill berry said tuesday in atlanta that ms 
oneill who is on medical leave due to crash injuries has not 
been disciplined he refused to say if she would be subject to 
penalties when she returns to a full schedule 
the flight originated in jackson miss and was bound for salt 
lake city after a stop at dallasfort worth 
crew members talked at length about the 1988 election and in 
reference to jackson one said you know its scary that someone 
like him could get as far as he did 
the conversation included exchanges about egrets that live at 
the airport and about the news coverage of plane crashes and 
elections 
the talk also turned to vice presidential candidate dan quayle 
and his wife marilyn one criticized her looks while another 
praised her oratory skills 
of reporters ms oneill said they are such vultures they 
really are theyre too powerful they really are 
the tape ends with a scream and the sound of the plane breaking 
apart

a space shuttle will be lost and astronauts 
may well die within the next decade if the united states carries 
out its vision of exploring the universe congress was warned in a 
report released wednesday 
if the united states wishes to send people into space on a 
routine basis the nation will have to accept the risks these 
activities entail said the study by the congressional office of 
technology assessment if such risks are perceived to be too 
high the nation may decide to reduce its emphasis on placing 
humans in space 
the price of increased space activity includes the likelihood 
that loss of life will occur the report said 
rep bill nelson dfla chairman of the house space science 
subcommittee told a news conference that the country must not 
forget going into space is a risky business 
were there to be another major disaster it would certainly 
shake the confidence of the american people said nelson who has 
flown in space himself 
that was one of the illserved byproducts of the extraordinary 
success of the space shuttle for 24 flights in which it became so 
routine in the mind of the american people that it was almost 
like getting into your car and taking a sunday afternoon drive 
when in fact its anythin but that he said 
nelson was a passenger on columbia as it made the last shuttle 
flight before a fireball engulfed challenger in 1986 with a loss of 
seven lives 
lets dont be overdramatic about this said nelson it 
doesnt have to be this horible explosiontype thing that occurred 
it could be the complete elimination of an orbiter in a mistake 
made in preparation a crane drops something on the fuselage and it 
is suddenly out of commission for two or three years 
ota said nasa could reduce some of the risks by building a fifth 
orbiter at a cost of 25 billion including spare parts nelson 
said he would favor adding to the fleet which will be brought to 
four ships when endeavour the challenger replacement is 
finished in 1992 
the ota report called round trip to orbit human space flight 
alternatives examines some of the policy choices congress faces 
in decisions for this century and the next 
if congress wants to reduce risks to the shuttle fleet during 
assembly of the space station ota said it could direct nasa to 
buy titan 4 launch vehicles or develop a socalled shuttlec launch 
vehicle which would use shuttle booster rockets and fuel tank to 
orbit a huge cargo container 
the report also laid out options to advance us crewcarrying 
capabilities beyond the shuttle era into the next century they 
include an advanced manned launch system leading to an advanced 
shuttlelike vehicle and a personnel launch system which could 
dispatch a crewcarrying vehicle from unpiloted launch rockets 
an aerospace plane able to take off from a runway and fly to 
orbit would be a major step forward ota said but would be much 
more expensive and a larger technical challenge 
space shuttle reliability to date with one catastrophic failure 
in 29 launches the challenger explosion on jan 28 1986 is 
965 percent a contractor estimated last year that a 
representative chance of mission success is 98 percent 
if reliability is and remains 98 percent there would be a 50 
percent chance of losing an orbiter on the next 34 flights a 72 
percent chance of losing an orbiter before the first space station 
assembly flight and an 88 percent chance of losing an orbiter 
before space station assembly is completed 42 flights later said 
ota 
it said those percentages differ from the risk faced by the crew 
because the crew might escape in some situations where the orbiter 
was lost 
current plans call for all hardware for the planned space 
station to be carried into orbit in shuttle cargo holds along with 
astronauts who will do the assembly engineers have been talking 
though of reducing the number of shuttle missions by carrying 
parts into orbit on heavyduty rockets 
continued dependence on only four orbiters could be risky 
said the report launching each orbiter three or four times every 
year creates a growing cumulative risk of accidents or wear out 
supporting the space station in addition to other crewrelated 
missions would be difficult if not impossible with fewer than four 
orbiters

marijuana and 200 per gram for cocaine 
the tax commission which issues the stamps is prohibited from 
trying to establish the identity of the buyer 
we will mail them to whatever address or post office box

the director of a chineseamerican arts 
organization in new york city said wednesday that none of the eight 
chinese opera performers who vanished last week plans to apply for 
political asylum 
the entertainers are scared to death by the publicity their 
disappearance has caused said alan chow executive director of the 
chinese american arts council 
the fate of the entertainers including seven opera stars and a 
popular actor has been unknown since the group fled the 28member 
kun opera company last week 
immigration officials in san francisco said wednesday they had 
no connect with the performers 
chow who would say only that he has some connection with 
the performers reported that four remained in san francisco two 
are in new york city and two are in washingon dc 
all are staying with relatives or friends said chow adding 
that he was uncertain whether the performers had planned to flee 
the opera group or acted spontaneously 
observers have speculated that the eight might be seeking 
democratic and economic freedoms in the wake of the studentled 
prodemocracy movement in china this spring 
but chow insisted that the artists will not seek asylum it has 
been common for performers from china hong kong and taiwan to 
arrive in the united states with a working visa and then apply for 
a student visa to enable them to study in this country he said 
those things always happen said chow its not too hard 
to change their visa to a student visa in a regular case now its 
very bad 
the performers did not know the risk they faced in seeking such 
a change following the government crackdown on the student

president bush said today he is leaving no 
stone unturned in trying to free american hostages in the middle 
east but lacks hard information as he tries to deal with the crisis 
in a prudent way 
bush said he had contacted many world leaders including british 
prime minister margaret thatcher and we have had assurance after 
assurance they want to help 
you can just rest assured that were going about our business 
in id say a prudent way he said declining to discuss any 
specifics of what he had in mind 
asked at a photo session if he had information that hostages 
lives might be in danger in the wake of the reported execution of 
marine lt col william higgins by shiite moslem captors bush 
replied 
we are considering that that might well be the case given 
statements we have seen 
please assume we are thinking prudently about this matter in 
every way possible and using diplomatic channels the president 
said were leaving no stone unturned 
however he added were dealing with less than a full deck 
when it comes to information it is very hard when youre dealing 
with this kind of cowardice and this kind of dastardly act to get 
all the information that you need to make a decision we are not 
dealing with all the facts 
bush was asked if it would make matters easier if israel 
released the leading moslem cleric whose kidnapping inflamed the 
hostage situation and prompted threats against the eight americans 
held captive 
without directly criticizing israel the president repeated his 
earlier call for a release of all hostages held by all parties in 
the region 
i think the release of everyone held against their will would 
be a good thing he said 
bush made the comments during a picturetaking session with 
sheik mohammed bin mubarak alkhalifa the foreign minister of the 
persian gulf state of bahrain the minister condemned the reported 
killing of higgins as an act against all humanity 
at the state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the 
administration is pleased with a statement tuesday by irans 
presidentelect ali akbar rafsanjani condemning higgins apparent 
execution and all acts of a terrorist nature 
she called on rafsanjani to act in accordance with the 
spirit of his statement we remain convinced that iran is in a 
position to bring significant influence to bear on those who hold 
the hostages and call on it to do so she said 
ms tutwiler also welcomed a statement by a top aide to 
palestine liberation organization leader yasser arafat criticizing 
the execution of higgins 
asked about potential military action in light of the movement 
of us warships in the middle east bush replied were 
prudently planning 
however his comments seemed to indicate he has made no 
decisions on a plan of action 
he said he was weighing the situation with a heavy heart and 
that it transcends religion it transcends alliances it gets in 
to a matter that concerns that entire civilized world so we 
will keep on trying 
the president is getting help from the pope and seeking aid from 
other world leaders to try to solve the lebanon hostage crisis but 
the white house cautioned against hopes for a quick solution 
bush received his daily intelligence briefing this morning in 
advance of a meeting with his top national security aides to assess 
information coming from the middle east 
meanwhile the vatican announced today that pope john paul ii 
has agreed to intervene to seek the return to the united states of 
the body of lt col higgins whose reported hanging monday by his 
kidnappers in lebanon precipitated the crisis 
in a 12minute telephone call tuesday bush asked the pope to 
intercede in getting the return of higgins body if in fact the 
officer had been executed his holiness expressed the willingness 
of the holy see to find a solution to this problem a vatican 
statement said 
pentagon officials said today the uss belknap the flagship of 
the us 6th fleet and the fleets commander canceled a scheduled 
visit to the soviet port of sevastapol to be at the beck and 
call of bush in case he needs them the aircraft carrier uss 
america also has cut short a visit and left the port of singapore 
officials said 
but officials played down the possibility of a military strike 
against hostageholders these are not necessarily bellicose 
moves but we want to be ready in case we are needed these are 
prudent measures said one official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the risks appear to greatly outweigh the potential payoff of 
any military strike an official said tuesday 
and the white house went out of its way to avoid drama that 
would make it appear a crisis was engulfing bushs presidency 
on tuesday night the president went ahead with plans for a 
jovial barbecue for congress members on the white house lawn 
appearing in shirtsleeves and leatherpocketed casual pants the 
president dined on ribs chatted cheerfully with his picnictable 
companions and clapped to the lively tunes of the oak ridge boys 
these are not easy days either in the congress or in the 
white house bush said in brief remarks there are overwhelming 
events that concern everybody here but even though there are 
complicated times i think an evening like this with just plain 
relaxation with friends is very very significant and very 
important 
spokesman fitzwater indicated a dramatic response was not 
imminent rather he said reporters should view the situation as 
a process for dealing with the situation over the long term and 
not look for any quick decision points 
we dont want to create a crisis atmosphere he said 
administration officials said they still had no firm 
confirmation that higgins was dead as his shiite terrorist captors 
claimed monday 
higgins wife robin said through a spokeswoman in washington 
she could not tell whether her husband was the man shown hanging in 
a grisly videotape the kidnappers released 
besides telephoning the pope bush called turkish prime minister 
turgut ozal while other us officials contacted the soviet union 
and other countries in the middle east seeking assistance in 
winning freedom for the remaining hostages 
the united states also is going through intermediaries to seek 
help from iran which is believed to have influence with kidnappers 
who hold the hostages the united states does not have formal 
diplomatic relations with iran 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze said in tehran that 
moscow would use its growing influence in iran on behalf of the 
hostages

government forces pushed back 
guerrilla fighters and took new territory near a stategic eastern 
city during fighting that killed 68 people the foreign ministry 
said wednesday 
after nearly daily rocket barrages for a month kabul was quiet 
for the second day as government forces rounded up suspected 
guerrilla sympathizers and seized weapons in the capital area said 
foreign ministry spokesman mohammad nabi amani 
on tuesday the government said 100 rockets were confiscated in 
the area and 50 people were arrested amani said wednesday that 
three egyptian sakr30 surfacetosurface rockets also were found 
about 15 miles east of kabul 
earlier wednesday about 200 moslem religious leaders and their 
followers demonstrated in kabul to protest the rocket attacks they 
blamed them on the united states and pakistan which supply weapons 
to the guerrillas 
in nangarhar province government forces drove back guerrillas 
fighters and seized new territory amani said the provincial 
capital is jalalabad an eastern city that the guerrillas have 
twice failed to capture in offensives since soviet soldiers 
withdrew in february 
amani said fighting in nangarhar province in the last 24 hours 
had left 62 guerrillas dead and 93 wounded he said six government 
soldiers were killed and 12 wounded 
in operations east of samar khel about 12 miles southeast of 
jalalabad government forces conducted search operations large 
quantities of arms and ammunition were seized near chapar har 
district amani said he gave no numbers 
the general condition of the war in chapar har and samar khel 
is that the enemy is retreating amani said but they are 
backed by the heavy artillery of the 11th division of the pakistani 
armed forces 
neighboring pakistan which allows the guerrillas to be based on 
its territory denies it is fighting with them in the decadeold 
civil war 
there was no independent confirmation of any of amanis reports 
amani also reported heavy clashes between supporters of rival 
guerrilla groups in tutum dara in parwan province north of kabul 
he said there were a lot of casualties but he gave no numbers 
among the groups involved was hezbeislami and jamiateislami 
he said 
the two fundamentalist groups have reportedly been engaged in a 
power struggle recently guerrilla sources have said hezb 
supporters ambushed jamiat forces on july 9 in the north and killed 
30 of their fighters 
the reported battles between the groups has raised new questions 
about the ability of the guerrillas to overthrow the marxist 
government in kabul 
in kabul the moslem leaders and their supporters demonstrated 
outside the un good offices mission 
american imperialists die they shouted while a small group 
of protesters shook and banged the metal gates at the entrance to 
un office 
the un office was established to help oversee the soviet 
withdrawal un officials are also supposed to help the 
governments of afghanistan and pakistan cut off arms supplies to 
both sides of the war 
since june 25 more than 280 people have been killed and 745 
injured in the rocket attacks and a car bombing in the kabul area

the house armed services committees top 
republican introduced legislation wednesday to restore the 
23000ayear pension former white house aide oliver north lost 
because of his felony convictions in the irancontra affair 
rep bill dickinson rala said north a 20year marine 
veteran has demonstrated his willingness to give his life for 
his country and should not be asked to give up the security of 
his own family on charges that may not have been his doing 
dickinsons legislation would exempt north from a law that 
denies retirement pay to any government officer convicted of 
destroying government documents one of three felony crimes for 
which north was convicted 
us comptroller general charles bowsher on monday rejected a 
recommendation from the navy that norths pension be restored 
saying there is serious doubt about whether north was entitled 
to retirement pay 
the navy suspended norths pension when he was sentenced july 5 
for his convictions on charges of aiding and abetting an 
obstruction of congress accepting an illegal gratuity and altering 
or destroying classified documents he was fined 150000 and 
ordered to perform 1200 hours of community service 
the navy recommended that bowsher restore norths pension after 
the navys judge advocate general concluded that north as a retiree 
should not be considered an officeholder under the terms of the 
law the navys general counsel had reached the opposite conclusion 
james hinchman the general accounting office lawyer who 
reviewed the navy recommendation for bowsher said it was 
impossible to avoid the conclusion that there is serious doubt 
that a retired regular officer convicted of destroying documents 
can continue to receive retirement pay 
hinchman said the denial of retirement pay to north gives him 
the right to file suit and seek a definitive ruling on whether the 
law applies to him 
sen steve symms ridaho offered an amendment to the fiscal 
1990 defense bill wednesday to restore norths pension but the 
senate adopted a modified proposal from senate majority leader 
george mitchell requiring the senate judiciary committee to study 
the issue and report to the senate by november

yamid reza pahlavi a younger brother of the 
late shah of iran grinned a toothless smile in the cell he shares 
with 23 other convicts in notorious evin prison and said things 
could be worse 
speaking in broken english to a group of foreign reporters on a 
conducted tour of the prison in north tehran he said he was 
serving a 10year sentence for a family reason but refused to 
be more specific 
he said he had seven more years to serve 
pahlavi wearing a white tshirt and gray pajama trousers lay 
sprawled on blankets spread on the cell floor there were no beds 
or any other furniture 
prison officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
prisoner had been disowned as a drug addict by shah mohammad reza 
pahlavi before the february 1979 islamic revolution toppled the 
monarchy 
the shah fled iran a month earlier with other family members 
he underwent medical treatment for cancer in the united states 
then went to panama and on to egypt where he died in july 1980 
the officials said yamid reza pahlavi was arrested as a vagrant 
and imprisoned three years ago 
we are welltreated here pahlavi 58 said adding that he 
was kept busy gardening and looking after roses 
other inmates in his cell included a former general and senior 
officials of the shahs regime who refused to give their names 
meeting the shahs brother was the highlight of sundays 
conducted tour arranged by the ministry of islamic guidance 
in a bizarre incident a danish reporter was attacked by a 
prison guard while the group was inspecting a block of empty cells 
i was walking down a corridor when suddenly this man started 
shouting in farsi and then pushed me into a cell and started 
beating me up said kurt lyndorff a correspondent for the danish 
newspaper jyllandsposten 
later the guard a bearded middleage man who refused to give 
his name started shouting that all the reporters on the tour were 
cia and kgb agents 
the guard later apologized and said he pushed lyndorff into a 
cell because the reporter had refused to identify himself as part 
of the group 
the mostly western journalists were among a limited number 
allowed into iran for the july 28 presidential elections 
the reporters were shown one of a dozen empty blocks of cells in 
the sprawling jail that held thousands of political prisoners in 
the islamic revolutions early days 
prison officials said the block was vacated after an amnesty 
declared in february during celebrations of the revolutions 10th 
anniversary 
hundreds of enemies of the revolution reportedly were 
executed in the prison set on a steep mountain slope in 
fashionable north tehran across a narrow wooded valley from a 
leading hotel the grand azadi 
the reporters were shown another block containing 12 large 
cells about 12 by 9 yards each with 24 inmates each had a 
television set but no furniture the prisoners sprawled on 
blankets reading newspapers 
officials escorting the journalists refused to say how many 
prisoners were in the jail interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi 
said earlier at a news conference that the only political prisoners 
left in evin were those serving life sentences for capital crimes 
mohtashemi said most prisoners now were drug addicts or 
narcotics peddlers jailed during an antidrug crackdown launched by 
the government in january 
the reporters also were shown the prison workshop where inmates 
were making military uniforms and shoes 
the guidance ministry provided interpreters so reporters could 
converse with the prisoners a few inmates spoke english 
all those interviewed said they were jailed for political 
offenses 
one prisoner who gave his name as mohammed aragi said he was a 
member of irans outlawed tudeh communist party 
he said a revolutionary court sentenced him to death on charges 
of spying for the soviet union but his sentence was commuted to 
life imprisonment under another amnesty declared by the late 
revolutionary patriarch ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
aragi 56 said he also spent time in jail during the shahs 
time for belonging to tudeh but conditions were better under the 
islamic regime 
things were far worse in the days of the shah prison guards 
used to beat us all the time now were welltreated and there are 
no beatings he said speaking in farsi through an interpreter

the head of the governmentcontrolled unions 
presented a draft labor law to the legislature wednesday saying 
soviet workers should be allowed to strike if binding arbitration 
fails tass reported 
stepan shalayev presented the law just days before the supreme 
soviet is to adjourn for the summer and a couple of weeks after 
strikes by hundreds of thousands of miners paralyzed much of the 
soviet unions coal industry 
the supreme soviet debate over the proposed law so soon after 
the strikes indicated that the government views labor unrest as a 
potentially serious problem for president mikhail s gorbachev and 
his reform effort 
but a leader of one siberian coal strike committee said strikers 
view shalayev and other national union officials as just another 
echelon of power and that more strikes are likely unless the 
soviet unions social and economic situation turns around 
soviet law in principle allows workers to strike but never has 
addressed the issue explicitly workers are walking off their jobs 
to protest low pay and bad working conditions as well as 
unwillingness of the official union leadership to help 
tass said shalayev told the supreme soviet the law calls for 
establishing conciliation commissions to settle labor disputes and 
gives either side the right to appeal to an arbitration commission 
set up by a local court 
it appeared from the tass report that the law calls for 
permitting strikes only when management fails to live up to an 
agreement or arbitration order 
the arbitration panel decision will be obligatory for 
fulfillment the official news agency said 
if the conflicting parties still fail to settle their 
differences a labor collective will be given the right to use all 
other methods envisaged by the law including a strike tass 
added however this can be done on the decision of the majority 
of the labor collective 
the law also prohibits strikes that endanger peoples lives or 
disrupt the normal life of the people or defense industries tass 
said 
it provided no details on what would be included in those 
categories but if interpreted broadly they could prohibit nearly 
all strikes 
workers engaged in a legal strike will receive part of their 
regular pay from management tass said 
shalayev acknowledged under questioning in the supreme soviet 
that the draft law needs amendments but the legislature endorsed 
it in general and set it for publication in the official press a 
legislative debate will take place in the fall 
tass said many supreme soviet deputies spoke out for expanding 
the right to strike and sharply defining those industries in which 
strikes are not allowed 
emphasizing workers suspicion of the official unions one of 
the coal strike leaders wrote in wednesdays edition of the moscow 
news that the strikers regarded the unions as one more upper 
echelon of power from which we are given orders 
teimuraz avaliani a member of the parliament and chairman of 
the strike committee in the kemerovo region of siberia said we 
need to create unions that are fundamentally new maybe 
alternative unions 
it simply didnt enter our minds to invite comrade shalayev to 
our side and we presented him with demands similar to other 
representatives of authority avaliani said 
avaliani said the strike was not an effort to take something 
away from somebody else but the action of people who live worse 
than anyone else

an advertising agency wednesday dumped hotel 
queen leona helmsleys 5 millionayear account and depicted 
itself as the latest victim of her imperious attitude and penny 
pinching 
mrs helmsley had a penchant for intruding in the ads and sealed 
her fate with taylorgordon aarons amp co inc when she imposed an 
arbitrary 60 percent cut in agency fees for may and june three 
company executives said 
ive been reading the papers this is part of the pattern 
shes squeezed other contractors said agency president elaine 
taylorgordon eventually no one escapes 
the company had handled the helmsley account on a verbal 
agreement for three years mrs helmsley was informed of the 
decision in a letter sent to her home 
the harsh words were the latest directed at mrs helmsley who 
was in federal court wednesday for her tax evasion trial witnesses 
have detailed her abrasiveness and hairtrigger temper mayor 
edward i koch called her the wicked witch 
ms taylorgordon who said her company stands to lose 500000 
a year from its decision pulled no punches herself 
all of us knew she was queen and we were there to serve her 
she said it was evident in her body language her imperiousness 
and her arrogance 
she also described a typical business meeting with mrs 
helmsley she was drinking martinis and i was drinking brioschi 
there was a lot of tension she told me dont get 
comfortable youre not here for a social event 
mrs helmsley approached by reporters at the courthouse about 
the agencys decision said nothing and zipped shut her lips 
taylorgordon aarons was not the first agency to use mrs 
helmsley in ads for the hotel chain or to dub her the queen 
her nickname among agency employees in fact she plays a smaller 
role in the agencys ads which emphasize the luxury of the 
accommodations 
still the tag line remains the helmsley palace the ads say 
is the only palace where the queen stands guard and the ads 
worked occupancy jumped from 24 percent before the ads to 87 
percent after 
nevertheless the ads were recently critiqued in adweek magazine 
as ranking among the worst advertising of our time terrible 
conceptually unoriginal poorly written badly artdirected and 
photographically ugly 
agency officials said mrs helmsley was deeply involved in their 
ad campaigns 
shed say i dont like the way that lapel looks i dont 
like the way that button looks and it wasnt a question said 
larry aarons the agencys creative director it was move that 
button lift that bale tote that barge 
ms taylorgordon cited a recent new york state advertising 
awards competition in which the helmsley ads were nominated 
there was such an uproar from certain judges that it was 
decided not to consider us for the award she said it was the 
client not the ads 
but ms taylorgordon predicted mrs helmsley would have no 
trouble finding another ad agency and well send them all our 
maalox advil and extra suits of armor

homeless people have formed a 
neighborhood watch to protect themselves from the threat posed 
by wine bottles spiked with glass shards that someone has been 
leaving around town 
thirtytwo spiked bottles have been found in the last month at 
various places where the homeless are known to go no one has been 
hurt police said wednesday 
people in suburban neighborhoods have these neighborhood 
watches because theyre worried about crime well homeless 
people are victims of crimes too john hatfield who camps near 
downtown said somebody may take a belt of this wine and get 
hurt real bad so some of us are walking the streets every night 
and keeping our eyes open 
he said the homeless are not the only ones in danger a group of 
children recently found six bottles in a park some advocates for 
the homeless contend that the police did not respond quickly enough 
if this had been a case of adulterated food in grocery stores 
you would have had a serious response immediately said jane 
haggstrom coordinator for the santa barbara homeless coalition 
police say they are aggressively investigating and have assigned 
a detective to the case fulltime although police did not begin 
posting flyers warning the homeless until july 20 the department 
issued a press release july 1 after the first bottle was found 
were finding these bottles in a relatively large geographical 
area so its not an easy case sgt richard glaus said and 
its not like food tampering inside a store where you can track 
down manufacturing and distribution methods with the wine bottles 
it appears as if the glass has been put inside the bottles after 
they were purchased

could unite the multiethnic community 
pepper a liberal champion of the elderly and poor who held the 
seat for the democrats since 1962 died may 30 at age 88

that cubanamerican out of context 
he richman was there when i said it she said i meant 
it as republican vs democrat i am a cubanamerican im also a

helicopters to iraq richman called soghanalian a patriot who 
helped us causes

its not easy getting into the guinness 
book of world records a university of connecticut fraternity found 
out 
sigma alpha epsilon members hoped the 350gallon milkshake they 
whipped up in february would earn them a spot in the record books 
next edition instead a 1500gallon chocolate milkshake made by 
the wezn radio station of bridgeport the previous fall at a 
festival in new haven took the record 
well it looks as though were not going to try and beat that 
record this fall at uconn said fraternity president eric 
dannheim he said the fraternity made a crack at the record when it 
found out in february that the guinness editors had not made a 
decision on the wezn entry 
we had decided before we began whether it was a guinness book 
record or not we were going to do it dannheim said we had a 
lot of fun doing it 
the radio stations giant milkshake was mixed at a 
baskinrobbins plant for the annual taste of new haven 
festival the mixture was then pumped into a dairy truck station 
spokeswoman patty lavigne said 
cyd smith a guinness editor said some editors at the record 
book had a problem with the mixing method which delayed a final 
decision 
it will just become a competition of who has the bigger 
truck said smith one thousand five hundred gallons is it 
its enough 
a sigma alpha epsilon chapter at dartmouth college in hanover 
nh also was planning to go for the record and was disappointed 
to learn of the new haven entry 
when we found out we were back to the same old routine 
said thomas repczynski the chapters treasurer well be 
relegated to chugging goldfish again

police said occasional bursts of machinegun fire and mortar 
explosions echoed on both sides of the green line which divides 
the capital into moslem and christian sectors 
the skirmishes were much lighter than confrontations have been 
in the past week and coincided with the moslem new year an 
official holiday throughout lebanon 
government offices banks and other businesses closed in moslem 
and christian sectors to mark the day but there was little revelry 
there is no celebration mood said sheik rashid anouti a 
sunni moslem clergyman beirut has been largely demolished and 
hundreds of innocent people have been killed do you expect anyone 
to celebrate anything 
according to police figures 511 people have died and 2170 have 
been wounded in the latest round of fighting which broke out march 
8 between gen michel aouns 20000 mainly christian troops and 
syrian soldiers and their moslem allies 
many city streets have been reduced to rubble and hundreds of 
thousands of residents have fled 
a threemember arab ministerial committee trying more than two 
months to solve lebanons crisis said tuesday it reached an 
impasse and blamed syria which keeps about 40000 troops in 
lebanon under an arab league peacekeeping mandate 
during an arab league summit in may king hassan ii of morocco 
king fahd of saudi arabia and algerian president chadli benjedid 
were asked to find a settlement by november to the war 
at the summit syria blocked proposals to replace its troops 
with a panarab force 
the leftist daily newspaper assafir which is close to the 
syrian government of president hafez assad described the 
committees report as very serious because it reflected a hostile 
attitude toward syria 
farouq abillama an aide to aoun described the committees 
report as an indictment of the syrian presence in lebanon 
aoun a maronite catholic has declared a war of liberation 
against syrias troops in lebanon he said they undermined their 
peacekeeping mandate by fighting on the moslem side 
iraqi foreign minister tareq aziz told the official iraqi news 
agency that an urgent session of the arab summit was necessary to 
solve the crisis 
an emergency arab summit bears the responsibility of dealing 
with the situation in lebanon and saving this arab country from 
occupation terrorism and blackmail said aziz who is also 
deputy prime minister 
syria is iraqs main arab foe and considers lebanon within its 
sphere of influence it has refused to lift a blockade on lebanons 
christian enclave until it receives assurances iraq has stopped 
sending arms to aouns troops 
aziz called for a collective arab stand against syria and said 
the arabs should identify syria as a major cause behind lebanons 
civl war he reiterated iraqs demand for an immediate syrian 
withdrawal from lebanon

a federal jury today found korean air lines 
acted with willful misconduct when one of its planes flew off 
course six years ago and was shot down by a soviet war plane 
killing all 269 people aboard 
the jury of three men and three women ruled that the actions by 
kals crew were one of the causes of the shootdown of flight 007 by 
a soviet fighter plane 
todays verdict permits the families of the dead passengers to 
file individual suits seeking damages in excess of a 
75000perpassenger limit on compensation set under international 
treaty 
after the ruling read in court by us district judge aubrey 
robinson the jury began deliberating the question of whether the 
families are entitled to punitive damages as well and if so in 
what amount 
in final arguments tuesday after a twoweek trial in us 
district court lawyers for families of the victims said flight 007 
was off course almost from the minute it left the ground in 
anchorage alaska and headed to its pacific ocean route for seoul 
south korea 
two pilots testifying as expert witnesses for the plaintiffs 
theorized that the crew misprogrammed at least one and possibly all 
three onboard computerized navigation systems while the boeing 747 
was in anchorage 
kal lawyer george tompkins said the main evidence in the case 
was a line drawn by soviet officials on a map showing an offcourse 
flight 007 flying for several hours over russian airspace hundreds 
of miles to the west of its planned route 
that russian line was furnished by the people who shot 
this plane down and killed these people tompkins said this 
disaster is going to remain a mystery until the russians come 
forward and say what evidence they have to support that black 
line 
tompkins said that to suggest the plane was off course for four 
hours means that the crew radioed in false position reports at 
three checkpoints in the pacific ocean 
lawyers for the families sought to prove that crew members had 
to have known they were off course yet decided to continue the 
flight rather than return to anchorage where they would have faced 
disciplinary action 
the jurys verdict was in accord with all the evidence said 
donald madole a lawyer for the families when this plane was 
flown off course into the danger area it was in fact willful 
misconduct 
tompkins said the company will appeal to the us court of 
appeals in washington dc 
i think as a matter of law willful misconduct was not shown by 
the evidence said tompkins 
a defense motion to set aside the case is pending before the 
judge

leaders of southeast asia and 
local royalty welcomed the 15yearold future ruler of this tiny 
oilrich nation into the adult world wednesday by sprinkling 
scented water on his hands 
cannons fired in salute and thousands of bruneians watched on tv 
to watch the ritual for prince almuhtadee billah the son of 
sultan hassanal bolkia 
leaders from indonesia malaysia the philippines singapore and 
thailand as well as 3000 other vips including members of the 
royal family government dignitaries and foreign diplomats were 
invited to the twohour ceremony in the throne hall of the sultans 
1778room palace 
the pomp and pageantry a combination of islamic ritual and 
malay culture were actually a commemoration of prince billahs 
circumcision a momentous event in the life of malay moslems 
even though the prince eldest son of the 43yearold sultan 
was circumcised a few years ago the ceremonies were dubbed 
berkhatan malay for circumcision 
coming of age is a more appropriate term an official said 
but tradition dictates that such ceremonies be called berkhatan 
a weeklong festival for the occasion began sunday with the 
beating of gongs and playing of pipes and other ethnic musical 
instruments at the main gate to the 300acre palace grounds 
the streets of the capital were decorated with multicolored 
lights and yellow bruneian flags fluttering from the top of 
virtually every building 
until wednesday however the ceremonies had consisted of solemn 
prayers chants of religious hymns and nightly poetry readings at 
the palace 
a few hours before wednesdays rites the sultan cited by the 
guinness book of world records as the worlds wealthiest man threw 
an elaborate dinner at the cavernous royal banquet hall whose 
arches are covered with 22carat gold tiles 
his guest list was headed by president suharto of indonesia 
president corazon aquino of the philippines and prime ministers lee 
kuan yew of singapore chatichai choonhavan of thailand and 
mahathir mohamad of malaysia 
in declaring the sultan the worlds richest individual guinness 
said that as its absolute ruler he has bruneis oil income and 
foreign exchange reserves of about 30 billion effectively at his 
disposal 
after all guests were seated about 100 men and boys marched up 
the middle of the hall bearing prince billahs regalia they 
included spears swords shields rifles pennants candles drums 
brass vases and urns 
behind them walked the young prince in a green costume gleaming 
with gold embroidery light from 12 giant chandeliers each with 
600 bulbs reflected off the gems on his headdress 
the normally shy boy appeared nervous just before moslem 
priests began chanting praise to allah prince billah rose from his 
cushioned thronelike chair set under a goldcolored canopy 
apparently realizing the miscue he quickly sat back his head 
bowed slightly 
as the chanting began the boys parents the leaders and other 
guests came forward one by one and sprinkled scented water on his 
hands resting on a cushion on his lap outside cannons boomed 
prince billah is the third of the sultans six children by queen 
saleha his first wife but the elder of two boys the sultan has a 
son and two daughters by his second wife queen mariam 
on thursday the prince will undergo a cleansing ceremony in the 
privacy of his apartments officials say the equivalent of this 
rite for commoners is a swim in a river 
after that 25000 children and other residents are expected to 
line the streets of bandar seri begawan to cheer prince billah as 
he rides past on a float 
ceremonies at the palace are to continue through sunday

an experimental drug that stimulates rather 
than suppresses the immune system offers new hope in preventing 
rejection of transplanted human organs a researcher says 
the central dogma has been that if you stimulate the immune 
system thats bad dr randall morris director of the 
laboratory for transplantation immunology at stanford university 
said in a telephone interview were developing a new dogma that 
says its possible to use the immune system as an ally 
results of his research which includes successful testing in 
rodents were delivered wednesday to delegates to the triennial 
international congress on immunology in west berlin 
morris is testing lectins proteins derived from plant tissue 
he said lectins promote the growth of certain white blood cells 
called tsupressors while the action of the tsupressors is not 
clear they apparently restrain another type of white blood cell 
tkillers that attack foreign tissue including transplanted 
organs 
in experiments at stanford transplanted hearts in rats remained 
free of rejection for more than two years with no side effects the 
rats received 50 days of lectin treatment morris said in the 
telephone interview before his west berlin speech 
tests on humans are still years away he said 
morris said the lectins and two other experimental drugs will 
require extensive further testing but may someday reduce the need 
for large doses of cyclosporine a potent drug now used to prevent 
transplant rejection by depressing the immune system 
if our initial hopes are proven we are nearing a fundamental 
turning point in being able to keep transplant patients healthier 
and alive longer he said 
since human organ transplants began with kidneys about 35 years 
ago doctors have been unable to prevent the rejection of 
transplanted organs without compromising the immune system 
cyclosporine derived from a soil fungus helps prevent 
rejection by restraining the formation of white blood cells that 
attack transplanted organs but the daily oral doses can lead to 
kidney failure and high blood pressure 
two other transplant experts dr thomas starzl at the 
university of pittsburgh and dr robert corry chairman of surgery 
at the university of iowa and president of the united network for 
organ sharing said the use of lectins is virtually untested 
elsewhere 
starzl said morris idea of boosting the immune system to 
prevent organ rejection is a departure from current thinking on the 
problem 
morris said tests at stanford found lectins and two other drugs 
fk506 and rpm were effective in preventing rejection of 
transplanted hearts in rodents 
like cyclosporine he said fk506 and rpm are derived from 
fungus and work by depressing the immune system but they are more 
powerful 
fk506 developed several years ago by a japanese company was 
nearly 20 times more potent than cyclosporine in rodent testing 
morris said 
heart transplants in rats treated for two weeks with fk506 
survived eight times longer some longer than a year than 
recipients treated with cyclosporine even though the fk506 dose 
was only onefifth that of cyclosporine morris said 
starzl said his testing of fk506 indicated that while it may be 
powerful it was too early to predict its potential 
corry said the hope is that fk506 would be less toxic but more 
effective than cyclosporin

truckers testifying behind a screen to conceal 
their identities told a house panel wednesday that they carried 
garbage in the same refrigerated trucks used for food hauls a 
legal practice a lawmaker called more than disgusting 
would you serve potato salad from your cats litter box 
penn state university food science professor manfred kroger 
rhetorically asked a house public works and transportation 
subcommittee during an allday hearing 
the investigations subcommittee released correspondence showing 
that campbell soup co geo a hormel amp co michigan sugar co 
and other food manufacturers had taken steps in the last two months 
to ensure that their products were not placed in the same trailers 
that hauled waste to landfills 
none of the food firms said it knew of such a practice but all 
said they wanted to safeguard against it 
the food and drug administration said an investigation had found 
no contaminated food 
the vice president and driver for a small familyowned trucking 
firm specializing in hauling meat products from the midwest to the 
east told the subcommittee foodgarbage hauling appeared widespread 
of the ten largest carriers in my area that haul refrigerated 
food products to the east coast six of them i know have loaded it 
garbage he said 
a woman trucker told the panel her firm hauled two loads of 
garbage on return trips by food trucks to the midwest she said she 
refused other loads because i just didnt want to put it in the 
trucks 
both truckers who testified were hidden by a partition on three 
sides because they did not want their identities made public 
according to the committee which also would not divulge their home 
states 
part of the problem is that trucks making trips east cannot 
afford to return to the midwest empty the male trucker said he 
said garbage is a dream commodity to return home with because 
youre not responsible for anything how could you destroy it 
still he said he felt there could be sanitary problems even 
though his trucks are steamcleaned im not a bacteriologist 
he said 
he said his meathauling trucks used to carry bales of waste to 
a landfill near youngstown ohio but stopped in june at the 
request of customers 
the interstate commerce commission in an inquiry last month 
confirmed the practice of food trucks carrying garbage according 
to testimony 
in one instance a food truck emptied at an ohio landfill 
emanated powerful garbage odors despite just being washed said 
bernard gaillard director of the iccs office of compliance and 
consumer assistance 
before the garbage haul the truck had carried avocadoes from 
california to new york city gaillard said 
rep william clinger rpa organized the hearing after a 
centre daily times newspaper reporter in his district observed 
trailers and refrigerator trucks in may either carrying or being 
loaded with municipal solid waste at a transfer station and being 
unloaded at an ohio landfill 
the idea of garbage being hauled in food trucks seems more 
than disgusting clinger said wednesday it seems dangerous 
he said a new law was needed because existing regulations are 
ambiguous 
the american trucking association a trade group said in a 
written statement that it would seem appropriate to ata to 
require that trailers be properly cleaned by steam or other 
effective process before they leave a landfill site 
refrigerator trailers with their ribbed stainlesssteel 
floors normally carry meat poultry dairy products fresh fruits 
and vegetables to market 
penn states kroger said there were chemical and microbiological 
arguments against foodgarbage hauling 
food trucks that back up into filthy dump sites presumably can 
easily be infected all over and later spread diseasecausing 
bacteria into the truck bodies and into food factories during 
loading he said

six weeks ago 
sister mary stanislaus mackey a member of the sisters of 
charity of the incarnate word will be moved to a houston convent

largecaliber handgun rob parrish the nuns neurosurgeon said 
sister stan as she is called was hit by a 38caliber bullet 
june 21 as she and two other nuns rode in a pickup truck in 
zaragoza el salvador the sisters are unsure of the motive for the

truck wanted to rob the nuns who had just been to a bank 
sister mackey worked in the town 10 miles south of san salvador 
in an orphanage for children whose parents have been killed in the 
nineyear civil war between leftist guerrillas and the government 
the bullet shattered her cheekbone after initial treatment in 
san salvador she was flown to houston where her religious order 
is based 
doctors operated june 26 to remove a bullet fragment lodged in 
her brain and to relieve swelling in her brain a second operation 
was performed july 8 to reattach the retina in her left eye 
there appears to have been some damage to her optic nerve and 
were not sure how much sight she will recover in her left eye 
dr james baker said 
sister mackey accompanied by a nurse and using a cane for 
support read a brief prepared statement at a news conference 
tuesday but declined to take questions 
i want to thank everyone for their interest and their 
prayers she said god has taken me completely into his hands 
and i thank everybody who has played a part in my recovery i 
especially appreciate the good work of my doctors the nurses 
priests bishops and the sisters of the congregation 
baker said he anticipated no longterm problems with motor 
functions although she had some problems with shortterm memory 
five or six men accused of the shooting were taken into custody 
within the past week said sister ann mary brangan one of the 
other nuns in the pickup truck but she has been unable to identify 
them for police

it may surprise some soggy easterners but 
drought the big 1988 weather story now getting little national 
attention is still a hot item in parts of america 
true the east and south which baked a year ago are now stuck in 
a summer of excessive wetness but the southwest relatively moist 
in the summer of 1988 is parched this year 
and parts of the corn belt in the nations middle as well as 
sections of california have been dry in both summers 
the western and midwestern dryness this summer continues a 
pattern of the decade which have seen serious regional drought 
somewhere in the united states every year except 1982 
more than half of the nation is undergoing either severely dry 
or excessively wet conditions an indication that the upper air 
flow patterns are allowing conditions to remain in place for long 
periods federal climate researchers report 
the 30day outlook for august contains some hope for the 
southwest although the heavier than normal rainfall expected this 
month isnt likely to continue over the upcoming 90 days the 
federal climate analysis center reports 
as for california dryer than normal conditions are forecast in 
august with the outlook mixed over the threemonth span 
even so it isnt as bad as last summer one of the driest years 
overall in this century 
in june for example the us geological survey found 27 
percent of the nations streams and rivers running below normal in 
june 1988 some 60 percent of rivers and streams were below normal 
a compromise disasterrelief proposal seems near in the senate 
as members of congress seek to help farmers cope with the 
cropwilting weather in some areas and drowned fields in other 
regions 
from may 1 to midjuly less than half of the normal rain fell in 
arizona new mexico and parts of texas california colorado 
nevada oregon idaho wyoming montana the dakotas nebraska 
wisconsin illinois and along the eastern edge of florida 
the excessive heat and dryness in the west has contributed to 
the extreme fire danger in many areas with dangerous blazes raging 
in idaho oregon california and other regions 
in the midwestern farm belt crops are suffering not only by 
lack of rain this year but with lack of soil moisture due to last 
years drought corn soybean and grain crops are affected among 
others 
some recent rains have helped the topsoil but so far have been 
too light to improve moisture conditions below the surface 
since may 1 below normal rainfall has persisted from southern 
california northeastward to the upper plains and illinois in 
extreme southern minnesota eastern iowa and western illinois 
deficits exceed 10 inches the climate analysis center reports 
june normally the wettest month in the midwest saw only 60 
percent of normal rainfall in parts of illinois minnesota and iowa 
the army corps of engineers has had to release impounded water 
to maintain navigation on parts of the missouri river and sections 
of the mississippi are carrying only about onethird of the usual 
flow for this time of year 
meantime the southeast was drenched with rains spawned by 
tropical storm allison in late june and early july the wetness 
extending as far as the middle atlantic states

a senior communist official indicated 
wednesday that his party could enact its own legislation on 
political reform if talks founder with the opposition but a 
communist negotiator urged patience 
the comment by deputy justice minister geza kilenyi came hours 
after members of the opposition accused the ruling communists of 
dragging their feet in negotiations that broke down last week 
the negotiations broke down over the wording of a new 
constitution a new party law party finances and the office of a 
new president with wide powers the first multiparty elections in 
hungary since the 1948 communist takeover are slated to be held 
next year 
kilenyi indicated legislative measures already drawn up by the 
communists but tabled for review in talks with the opposition 
could be considered in parliament without discussion if the 
negotiations remain inconclusive 
if there is no suitable progress made we will simply take 
those items of draft legislation and put them back on the table 
again in parliament he said 
kilenyi criticized the opposition round table which includes 
nine opposition groups for what he called their inflexibility 
but central committee secretary gyerogy fejti a leading 
communist negotiator said he still seeks an agreement 
it does not help the achievement of a compromise if differing 
views are made public too early fejti said compromise 
requires an atmosphere of patience and calm 
imre pozsgay a top reformer on the executive political 
committee politburo has promised an agreement regardless of how 
long it takes 
at an earlier news conference janos kis of the league of free 
democrats alleged the hungarian socialist workers communist party 
is trying to suggest to the nation that the choice is between 
that party and chaos 
peter toelgyessy of the league of free democrats said the 
communists want to retain in the constitution the paragraph on the 
working class as the leading social force in the nation and other 
such holdovers from the present constitution based on the stalinist 
model 
he said the communists want to use the constitutional state as 
a smokescreen and continue business as usual under the same 
management 
the opposition groups disagree on the need to have a law on 
parties contending that the existing law on association is 
sufficient and only a law on party financing and operation is 
needed 
a major obstacle in the talks is whether the wealth of the 
communist party should be distributed to other groups 
on july 27 the communists who had been amenable to discussing 
the issue reversed their position they said the party acquired 
its assets legally and that distribution of the money is an 
internal party affair 
on wednesday fejti sidestepped a question on his partys 
financial holdings 
there is also disagreement on who may field candidates in first 
multiparty elections next year and how many signatures will be 
required to get on the ballot and where and how such signatures may 
be collected

orders for manufactured goods edged up a 
slight 04 percent in june reflecting a rebound in demand for 
military hardware the government said wednesday 
the commerce department said new orders for manufactured goods 
totaled a seasonally adjusted 2346 billion in june following a 
sharp 26 percent plunge in may 
many analysts said they were unimpressed by the slight rebound 
in june pointing out that the big drop in may was the third 
setback so far this year they also noted a report tuesday that the 
purchasing managers index a widely watched barometer of economic 
conditions fell in july to its lowest point in 6 years 
the industrial sector is losing ground said bruce 
steinberg senior economist at the new york brokerage firm of 
merrill lynch we are seeing a mild recession developing in the 
united states right now 
steinberg predicted that the economy would contract in both the 
current quarter and in the fourth quarter of this year before 
beginning to recover in early 1990 
however other economists were not as pessimistic noting that 
the housing industry which had been in a slump earlier this year 
is beginning to rebound another government report wednesday showed 
that new homes sales climbed 55 percent in june the third monthly 
increase 
cynthia latta an economist with drimcgraw hill said the 
pickup in housing should spill over into manufacturing helping to 
bolster sales of home appliances and building materials 
ms latta and other economists said one reason they believed the 
country would be able to escape a recession is that unsold 
inventories have not built up to such high levels that they would 
trigger sharp cutbacks in production over the months ahead 
those economists also noted that the backlog of unfilled orders 
considered a good indicator of whether production cutbacks will be 
needed continued to rise in june climbing by 05 percent to 
4903 billion the orders backlog has not declined since february 
1987 
in june new orders for durable goods items expected to last 
three or more years rose 04 percent to a seasonally adjusted 
1242 billion this represented a slight upward revision from an 
advance report a week ago that put the increase at 03 percent 
orders for nondurable goods rose 04 percent as well with 
various consumer categories showing strength 
much of junes overall advance came from an 183 percent surge 
in orders for military equipment a rebound from an 114 percent 
drop in this volatile category in may 
orders in the key category of nondefense capital goods edged up 
03 percent in june following a 77 percent decline in may this 
category is closely watched for signs of industry plans to expand 
and modernize 
many economists said they believed that business investment 
which has been strong over the past year will weaken in the last 
half of 1989 but the bush administration is counting on continued 
strength in investment to support its optimistic forecast that the 
overall economy will grow by 29 percent as measured by the gross 
national product 
shipments of manufactured goods fell 05 percent in june to 
2319 billion the trend in shipments has been flat this year 
averaging 2312 billion about 15 percent less than orders each 
month

the flagship of the us 6th fleet canceled a 
ceremonial visit to a soviet port and it and other warships were 
put at the beck and call of president bush on wednesday in case 
theyre needed in the hostage situation pentagon officials said 
the aircraft carrier uss america and eight escort ships also cut 
short a port call in singapore other officials said but the 
pentagon refused to reveal the carriers destination or the reason 
for the battle groups early departure 
military officials speaking privately emphasized that the ship 
movements were not bellicose actions and noted that the forces 
in the mediterranean area remain at the normal peacetime level 
but the announcements highlighted the type of showtheflag 
movements designed to give the impression that us forces are 
ready to act if the president decides to use them 
were positioning ourselves at the beck and call of the 
president said one pentagon official familiar with the tactics 
these are not necessarily bellicose moves but we want to be 
ready in case we are needed these are prudent measures the 
official said 
the pentagon official stressed that extensive onscene 
diplomatic efforts are under way and that emphasis is not being 
placed on a possible military strike 
we are just giving the president what he might need the 
official said 
but the official also pointed out in case a strike is ordered 
us ships are ready with their longrange guns aircraft and 
missiles even if they remain some distance from a possible target 
you dont have to be near the shore to do what may be 
necessary the official said 
in a statement the pentagon announced that the uss belknap the 
navy flagship in the mediterranean canceled a fourday call at the 
port of sevastapol 
two other ships the uss thomas s gates and the uss kauffman 
were slated to keep to the scheduled visit set for aug 48 
the belknap a guided missile cruiser with fleet commander vice 
adm james d williams aboard had been scheduled to call at the 
black sea port as part of a longplanned exchange worked out 
between the superpowers 
three soviet ships just departed norfolk va after conducting 
the first such visit to a us port in 14 years 
williams and his ship are required elsewhere and will not be 
able to visit sevastopol the pentagon statement said 
the statement made no mention of the reported execution of lt 
col william higgins or of threats by shiite moslem factions to

although many poles may find it unsavory 
to have a policeman heading the government the election wednesday 
of gen czeslaw kiszczak as prime minister means very little change 
before the presidential election july 19 the three most 
important officials were gen wojciech jaruzelski mieczyslaw f 
rakowski and kiszczak the interior minister 
on wednesday after the government and communist party moves 
were completed the three most important figures were jaruzelski 
rakowski and kiszczak 
now they have different job titles and roles but the same team 
is in place for the communist party to continue its contradictory 
policy of agreement and struggle with the reborn solidarity 
trade union movement 
the party needs agreement with the opposition to cure polands 
economic problems but the party also needs to fight with the 
opposition for the hearts and minds of at least a part of the 
population 
jaruzelski the author of the policy who has resigned as 
communist party leader assumed the newly strengthened office of 
president with ultimate control of the military and foreign 
relations he is a guarantee to polands communist neighbors that 
moves toward democracy demanded by solidarity wont bring any 
sudden change in the countrys loyalty to the soviet union and 
warsaw pact 
he was polands top leader before and he retains that power now 
in addition he has prolonged his time in power party rules 
would have required him to step down as leader after the next party 
congress in 1990 now he can hold the office of president at least 
until 1995 
rakowski whom solidarity leaders would like to impeach for 
alleged mismanagement of the economy during his nine months as 
prime minister moves over to jaruzelskis old office at party 
headquarters 
a strongwilled player of political hardball he riled the 
opposition early in his administration with his decision to close 
solidaritys birthplace the lenin shipyard in gdansk he riled it 
again at the end of his term with spectacular increases in food 
prices 
according to one central committee member quoted during the 
party debate on rakowskis candidacy public confidence in the 
government fell by half during his tenure 
now that solidarity holds a good chunk of the national assembly 
control of the 100member senate and 35 percent of the sejm the 
prime minister by necessity must be able to work with the union 
always more of a fighter than conciliator rakowski did not fit the 
job description 
in key ways however he does fit the needs of the party its 
selfconfidence and fighting spirit deflated as the result of its 
crushing losses to solidarity in the june parliamentary elections 
rakowskis most important trait is that he will get the party up 
off its knees a party spokesman said this week 
enter kiszczak as interior minister since 1981 in charge of an 
army of uniformed and secret police he knows the opposition better 
than anyone else in government his agents tapped their telephones 
and collected their illegal publications 
during two waves of strikes last year kiszczak opened channels 
of communication to the opposition and called for the talks that 
evolved into the historic roundtable accords that legalized 
solidarity and led to the countrys first democratic elections 
since world war ii 
as head of the police he had credibility with solidarity as a 
negotiating partner and did not risk appearing too soft to his 
colleagues when he made concessions 
in nominating kiszczak to head the government after rakowski 
jaruzelski emphasized his proven ability at the round table to 
reach agreements speaking of his relationship with solidarity 
leader lech walesa last month kiszczak himself acknowledged the 
same 
we differ in many respects and yet so far we have always 
managed to come to an agreement when matters of crucial agreement 
were concerned he said and this is what counts most 
although the job switches undoubtedly suit the current needs of 
jaruzelski and the communist party they are bound to disappoint 
many poles who expected dramatic changes when they voted in 260 out 
of 261 solidarity candidates during the parliamentary elections 
in the end the same people will be in charge 
what kind of new government is that supposed to be said a 
disgruntled lawmaker from the communistallied peasant party

health secretary louis sullivan told congress 
wednesday that while methadone programs are not ideal they are 
better than doing nothing to help heroin addicts quit their habit 
and avoid aids 
sullivan testifying before the house select committee on 
narcotics abuse and control defended his departments proposal to 
make methadone available to more addicts to prevent needlesharing 
and help curb the spread of aids 
this is not ideal he said in response to two studies 
critical of the plan but this we feel is better than nothing 
for those individuals 
he emphasized that the program proposed in march would be an 
interim step that would allow heroin addicts to receive 
methadone while they wait for an opening in a comprehensive 
methadone treatment program 
the general accounting office and drug enforcement 
administration in separate studies presented to the committee 
questioned the wisdom of the department of health and human 
services plan they cited continued drug abuse by many patients in 
treatment and illegal diversion of the methadone 
under the hhs proposal heroin addicts unable to get into a 
comprehensive treatment program would be able to receive methadone 
daily at outpatient clinics and from mobile medical units the 
synthetic narcotic would not be provided for takehome use and 
addicts would be counseled on avoiding aids 
heroin addicts often share needles and in doing so can spread 
or contract the aids virus methadone which is used to help 
relieve an addicts craving for heroin and is less addictive is 
taken by mouth eliminating the risk from needles 
about 100000 people were undergoing methadone treatment last 
year the government estimates there are about 500000 heroin 
addicts nationwide 
preliminary results of the gao study of 15 methadone programs in 
five states indicate that as many as 47 percent of patients in 
treatment for more than six months at one clinic continued to use 
drugs forty percent of patients at another clinic used cocaine 
results of our work indicate that most clinics have not been 
able to deal effectively with the drug problems of many of their 
patients janet l shikles director of national and public 
health issues for the gao an arm of congress said in testimony 
submitted to the panel 
it is unclear how effective the interim maintenance program 
would be in reducing the spread of aids she said gao believes 
that additional information is needed before the program is allowed 
to be implemented nationwide 
the gao reviewed methadone clinics serving more than 3300 
patients in new york california washington florida and texas 
most clinic officials gao investigators interviewed did not support 
the hhs plan allowing interim methadone maintenance programs she 
said 
gene r haislip deputy administrator of the deas office of 
diversion control said an investigation conducted in the new york 
metropolitan area between aug 21 and sept 16 1988 found there 
is significant selling of takehome dosages of methadone 
haislip said many of the programs monitored by dea have lax 
safeguards and routinely ignore test results that show patients 
are using other drugs rather than take taking their methadone 
there is little incentive for individuals to become drugfree 
because their steady supply of methadone provides them with a 
constant source of illicit income with which to purchase other 
drugs primarily cocaine he said

the communistled coalition overcame 
internal rifts wednesday to elect polands interior minister gen 
czeslaw kiszczak as prime minister securing the communist partys 
control of the government 
kiszczak said his first priority would be to provide food to the 
nation which was reeling from price increases of up to 300 percent 
that took effect tuesday many store shelves were empty because 
consumers stocked up on supplies before the prices went up 
kiszczak has been head of the nations powerful police force the 
past eight years and was a leading enforcer of the 1981 martiallaw 
crackdown on the solidarity trade union parliament elected him 
237173 with 10 abstentions he needed 211 votes 
the election completed a trio of changes in polands top 
echelons which leave the same personalities in power but with 
different functions 
former party leader gen wojciech jaruzelski was elected 
president last month former prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski 
succeeded him as party chief and kiszczak replaced rakowski 
the party kept the top political jobs despite a humiliating 
defeat in june elections the countrys most democratic in 40 
years 
a political monopoly of exercising power by one party must be 
discarded and destroyed it does not serve the country 
solidarity floor leader bronislaw geremek told parliament before 
the vote 
we stand against this candidacy because no personnel 
reshuffle within the present political arrangements dictated by 
the monopoly of a single party can solve the countrys problems 
kiszczak must form a new government and work with solidarity 
lawmakers to rebuild the economy 
the most urgent task today is the problem of feeding the 
nation and filling empty shelves kiszczak said on the evening 
news as chief of the government i will devote my whole effort 
to that 
kiszczaks candidacy appeared threatened tuesday when some 
deputies of the communistallied peasants party threatened to 
withdraw their support communist officials persuaded them to vote 
for kiszczak 
the communist coalition holds a 299161 majority in parliament 
but the communists themselves hold only 173 seats the peasants and 
democratic parties hold the rest in the coalition 
solidarity lawmakers went into caucus after the vote to see 
which of their members had not cast ballots and possibly helped 
kiszczak many solidarity deputies boycotted the presidential vote 
rather than casting no votes allowing jaruzelzki to win by a 
slim margin 
in his acceptance speech kiszczak renewed a communist party 
proposal to form a grand coalition in which solidarity 
lawmakers would be offered some ministries the opposition has said 
it will not join such a coalition 
i will not give up efforts to attract the representatives 
of the opposition circles with a hope that in the future a grand 
coalition government will be possible kiszczak said 
communist leaders would like solidarity to join the government 
to share in difficult decisions that must be made to reform the 
economy but the party says it is not prepared to give the 
opposition the prime ministers job or key ministries such as 
defense and the interior 
in a speech before the vote kiszczak called for drastic 
measures to prevent economic destabilization among his proposals 
were budget cuts reevaluating investment policy and curbing some 
exports including cattle 
kiszczak said he hoped to form a government within two weeks he 
then must tackle the economy 
the value of the zloty is plunging daily shoppers emptied store 
shelves last week ahead of tuesdays sharp price increases and 
discontented workers throughout the country are grumbling that the 
time has come to strike 
the price increases were part of a controversial 
marketization plan of rakowski authorities said the increases 
are needed to prompt farmers to deliver their meat and produce to 
market and to stabilize the level of state subsidies to the food 
industry 
earlier wednesday the communist party lost a key vote for the 
first time in postwar poland as solidarity lawmakers pushed through 
a resolution calling for an extraordinary investigation of the 
activities of the rakowski government 
solidarity believes the government should be held accountable 
for the economic situation 
the commission will decide if there are legal grounds to refer 
alleged misconduct to the state tribunal which handles government 
impeachments 
the deputies voted 206169 with 31 abstentions to create the 
commission 
neither jaruzelski nor rakowski was present for the vote 
officials tuesday said rakowski went to the hospital after a spell 
of faintness in connection with a previously unpublicized heart and 
blood pressure problem a secretary in his office wednesday said he 
was feeling better and was no longer in the hospital

the international uproar over the reported 
killing of lt col william higgins including criticism from 
irans presidentelect left us officials somewhat encouraged 
wednesday about the fate of the second american hostage facing a 
death sentence in lebanon 
two days after a militant shiite group in lebanon announced 
higgins execution on monday state department spokeswoman margaret 
tutwiler said she was unable to think of a single country that 
hasnt spoken out against the action 
still other officials cautioned the situation remains grim 
pointing out the captors of joseph cicippio who was taken hostage 
in 1986 have not backed off their pledge to execute him on 
thursday 
ms tutwiler seemed to attach importance to a joint statement 
issued tuesday in tehran by soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze and irans presidentelect ali akbar hashemi 
rafsanjani in which they expressed regret over higgins reported 
death 
they also condemned all acts of a terrorist nature 
ms tutwiler called on rafsanjani to act in accordance with 
the spirit of his statement 
she said the united states remains convinced that iran is in a 
position to bring significant influence to bear on the 
proiranian groups who hold the american hostages and she called on 
the iranians to use the influence 
if higgins death is confirmed that would leave eight american 
hostages in lebanon the state department was still unable to 
confirm absolutely that the body in the videotape released monday 
in beirut was that of higgins 
ms tutwiler also welcomed a statement by a top aide to 
palestine liberation organization leader yasser arafat criticizing 
the execution of higgins 
the sense among american officials was that the outrage 
expressed by western as well as islamic countries about the 
developments in beirut may be having an impact on iran and its 
shiite allies in lebanon 
the officials asking not to be identified left open the 
possibility that the iranians may have convinced the captors of 
cicippio 58 to delay his execution by 48 hours 
a crisis atmosphere had prevailed here when the group claiming 
to hold cicippio the revolutionary justice organization said it 
would kill him tuesday at 11 am edt unless israel freed a shiite 
moslem cleric kidnapped by israeli commandos july 28 
with the delay in administering the death sentence officials 
expressed hope that intensified diplomatic efforts by us envoys 
may be bearing fruit the us diplomats have been in touch with a 
number of countries with access to or influence with iran 
in beirut shiite moslem sources said iranian pressure may have 
been behind the decision to delay the execution and added the 
chance his life may be spared has increased

the house voted tentatively on wednesday to 
make the smoking ban on most airline flights permanent but decided 
not to consider extending the prohibition to all routes 
on a 259169 vote lawmakers adopted language that would make 
permanent the current ban on smoking on flights of two hours or 
less which otherwise will expire next april the ban covers 80 
percent of domestic air traffic 
but the provision which was not actively opposed by the tobacco 
industry also forbade consideration of a proposal to extend the 
ban to all domestic flights 
the language became part of the 119 billion transportation 
appropriations bill for fiscal 1990 which begins oct 1 the house 
planned to complete work on the bill on thursday and send it to the 
senate 
rep richard durbin dill sponsor of the smoking ban 
proposal cited surveys of airline passengers by health groups 
showing an overwhelming number of them support the twohour ban 
congress adopted in april 1988 
i cant think of a thing weve done on the floor of the house 
in the last two years that has been greeted as positively and 
warmly by the american people he told his colleagues 
durbin who sponsored the 1988 law wanted to offer an amendment 
that would have banned smoking on all domestic flights but he was 
blocked by the rules of the house from offering it and was unable 
to persuade the house to change the procedure 
the smoking ban provision was backed by airline employee and 
health organizations which have argued that socalled secondary 
smoke breathed by people sitting next to smokers can be dangerous 
the tobacco and cigarette industries and their supporters in 
congress mostly from tobaccogrowing states have argued that 
definitive data on the dangers of smoking is lacking and that a 
prohibition hurts growers and manufacturers 
however lobbyists laid low during wednesdays vote they 
conceded that antismoking sentiment in congress had reached the 
point where they were better off accepting a permanent ban on 
twohour flights and avoiding fights on broadening the prohibition 
every time the law expires 
were not going to support this but that doesnt mean were 
actively opposing it either walker merryman vice president of 
the tobacco institute said before the vote 
this is no worse than what weve been living with said rep 
walter jones dnc whose district is one of the biggest tobacco 
producers in the country we hope this is the last well hear of 
this for the time being 
technically the house vote was on the procedure lawmakers will 
follow when they debate the transportation spending bill on 
thursday and other issues were involved but floor debate over the 
provision was dominated by the smoking ban question

florida gov bob martinez brought president 
bush a thick packet of recommendations wednesday from the national 
governors association on how to wage the war on drugs 
bush promised to forward the proposals swiftly to drug policy 
chief william j bennett who is due to unveil a new national 
drugfighting strategy next month 
the governors 10point plan approved at their summer meeting 
in chicago on tuesday endorsed bushs call for a hemispheric drug 
summit and urged that foreign aid be tied to countries cooperating 
with us efforts to eradicate drugs 
the loss of a generation of young people because of the abuse 
of drugs is the most serious issue facing the nation 
martinez said after emerging from the oval office 
providing a larger carrot in foreign aid and perhaps a 
better deal on the reduction of the world debt i believe is a 
good way to go said martinez 
he added that a new extradition treaty with colombia with some 
teeth is also needed 
the governors also urged the bush administration to convert idle 
military bases into federal drug prisons 
the land is there the facilities are there its a question 
many times of perimeter fences so were not talking big money on 
most of these items that we are submitting to the white house 
martinez said 
bush did not indicate to me how close they were in developing 
the policy said martinez 
he said they also discussed the congressional primary results in 
miami where state sen ileana roslehtinen captured the gop 
nomination for the seat of the late claude pepper the democratic 
race is headed for a aug 15 runoff two weeks before the special 
election 
martinez said he also informed bush of the national governors 
association vote tuesday calling for a twoyear moratorium on 
expanding medicaid 
martinez who has called a special session of the florida 
legislature oct 10 to seek stricter limits on abortion said he 
and bush did not discuss abortion 
florida lawmakers will be the first to tackle the issue since 
the recent supreme court ruling giving states more authority to 
restrict abortions 
the governor said he was trying to balance the rights of women 
and the unborn child 
martinez said he favors changing state law to declare the fetus 
viable at the 20th week instead of the 24th to impose higher 
medical standards for abortion clinics and to require attending 
physicians to counsel women about the health of the unborn baby 
before performing abortions 
i cannot imagine anyone who would like to see an unborn baby 
thats viable aborted said martinez who said he supports state 
funding of abortion for poor women only in cases of rape or incest 
or if the womans life is threatened 
asked about polls that indicated most floridians were 
prochoice martinez said it depends which polls you look at 
ive seen enough polls to know that people do not want abortion 
to be a system of birth control im also confident that the 
floridians do not want to see a viable baby aborted

in a tranquil treelined park near the 
prairie teenagers from china the soviet union and the united 
states have been writing a play they hope will help make their 
dreams of peace come true 
the script developed over the past two weeks opens with 
characters from each country on a stage behind a mountain topped 
with a star discord among them is represented by fog as they 
struggle musically occasionally striking a note of harmony 
at the end of the play the star on the mountain comes to the 
characters and pieces of the mountain form a bridge to the 
audience 
our goal must be to show peace and friendship said shan 
jian one of two 16yearolds from beijing who joined two others 
from the soviet union and the united states in writing the script 
the chinese participants are leaving thursday but next summer 
15 students from china and the soviet union are expected to arrive 
in fargo to work with young american artists on the performance 
the play financed through an assortment of private and public 
sources then is scheduled to tour the united states the soviet 
union and china 
its really a process to create a link between the people of 
these nations says vicki chepulis director of the imagine 
program at the trollwood performing arts school 
set on a 44acre park in this city of 100000 trollwood was 
created in 1978 following the model of washingtons wolf trap to 
offer young people a chance to study the performing arts more than 
300 students come each summer 
the involvement of the soviet and chinese students who arrived 
last month began with a visit by trollwood founder john marks to 
china in 1986 he proposed an exchange about the same time 
chepulis was proposing an exchange with students from the soviet 
union 
in our own naive way we said why dont we do both 
chepulis recalled officials in china and the soviet union 
supported the idea 
what we really strive for is creativity and confidence 
marks said with the attitude that you need to be friends before 
you can write a play 
to me the whole way this project started was a dream 
everybody wants to have a peaceful world what better way to show 
that than through the arts 
the play with a working title imagine aims to be a 
celebration of the three cultures and a challenge to others to 
imagine what it would be like if people of all countries could work 
together 
it is designed as a rock opera with the story conveyed through 
music and movement instead of words 
one of the chinese student advisers is ding zhen chun 49 whose 
performance as the monkey king is a highlight of the beijing 
opera ding said he was not worried that the recent violence that 
followed student demonstrations in china would threaten the 
program even though it did delay the students arrival in fargo 
but they preferred not to talk about it 
what it really made me realize is that it was just people to 
people and thats all we were interested in i think they just 
wanted to focus the project chepulis said

the unity and freedom of latin america is a 
dream within a dream that must soon become reality author 
gabriel garcia marquez said wednesday as he accepted an award for 
his contributions to the fulfillment of that dream 
in his prose gabriel garcia marquez presents the various 
facets of the vision of a single latin america jose juan de 
olloqui chairman of banca serfin told 300 people at the mexican 
presidential residence 
president carlos salinas de gortari presented the serfin prize 
to the nobel prizewinning author but made no remarks the prize 
carries no monetary award a bank official said 
garcia marquez grappled with the problem of latin unity in his 
latest book the general in his labyrinth a controversial 
novel cast as a deathbed narrative by simon bolivar a hero of 
south americas independence from spain 
bolivars goal was not just independence but the creation of a 
united latin american federation to compete with the united states 
in north america that vision dissolved into the separate nations 
including bolivars greater colombia now colombia venezuela 
ecuador bolivia and peru 
the book has created a literary controversy because it deals 
with a sensitive subject and because of its demythologizing 
portrayal of the man known as the liberator as a foulmouthed 
libertine 
in his brief remarks garcia marquez began by recounting a story 
by italian author italo calvino in which an emperor of china asks a 
painter to portray a crab 
the painter replies that it will take five years and hell need 
a house with 12 servants when the five years are up he asks for 
another five years 
when the emperor comes back again the painter rises snatches 
up his brush and in an instant paints the most beautiful crab ever 
seen 
in this story from ancient china you can see a crude 
representation of artistic creation the most incomprehensible and 
enslaving of human passions garcia marquez said 
the 20th century which has unleashed the furies of the atom 
as a servant of death and seen a flag planted on the windless 
wastes of the moon might be just another of mans many lost 
centuries if if were not for a dream 
let us dream aloud then let us dream that a fundamental 
change has started in the world that the craziest concentration of 
power in the history of mankind is ending because the dogmas that 
sustained the two sides are breaking down and we are headed for a 
new millenium dominated by the freedom of creative thought 
inside those dreams garcia marquz said lies bolivars dream 
the dream of a united latin america finally part of the torrent 
of history made up of our invincible culture our inspired 
nightmares our crazy magic of the disasters that revive us and 
the irresistible power of the imagination 
mr president ladies and gentlemen latin americans all i 
think it is time for us to draw the crab

the cost of running the nations farms rose 
75 percent to 1184 billion in 1988 with farmers paying the bulk 
of their money for basics such as feed stock and machinery the 
agriculture department reported wednesday 
despite the increase the figure falls short of the record 
1318 billion farmers spent in 1981 just before the general 
financial crunch that stalled expansion in the agricultural sector 
in 1987 farmers spent 1101 billion for the buildings feed 
livestock rent labor seeds and plants fuels equipment and 
other components of raising livestock and crops 
average expenditures per farm last year were 54956 an 
increase of 4165 from 1987 
the increase outstripped the nations overall inflation rate 
which was 44 percent last year 
farms with annual sales of more than 100000 averaged 271481 
in expenditures and accounted for 68 percent of the total expenses 
they spent most of their money on services feed labor livestock 
and poultry farm machinery interest and fertilizer 
farms with sales of 40000 to 100000 had expenses averaging 
75371 and contributed 16 percent of the total their main 
expenses were services feed and machinery 
small farms those with sales under 40000 averaged expenses 
of 15464 and accounted for 15 percent of the total feed farm 
services and farm machinery were the leading expenses 
feed was the highest single cost item at 179 billion dollars 
in 1988 accounting for 151 percent of total costs the previous 
year feed cost 149 billion dollars and accounted for 135 
percent of expenses the highest single expense item that year as

nations production expenses thats up from 24 billion in 1987 
that category includes cash and share rent vet supplies and 
services marketing and storage expenses insurance utilities 
leasing and transportation 
the only expenses to drop were interest payments which 
decreased 37 percent to 837 billion and building and fencing 
which dropped 103 percent to 223 billion 
the analysis dealt only with production expenditures and did not 
include figures for net income or profits 
annual spending by farmers reached its nadir this decade in

a former cabinet minister with reform credentials 
emerged wednesday as the clear frontrunner for prime minister 
after maneuvering within the governing party which is beset by 
scandal and plummeting popularity 
former education minister toshiki kaifu was the only declared 
candidate after a day of meetings by liberal democratic party 
leaders the party is expected to elect a new party president on 
tuesday and then vote him in as prime minister on aug 10 
with its large majority in the lower house of parliament the 
party can be assured of victory in the vote for prime minister 
kaifu 58 gained support though lukewarm from enough party 
factions to make him the leading contender no other strong 
candidate was put forward but other people could still be 
championed until saturday morning 
the former minister would succeed prime minister sousuke uno he 
resigned last month after only eight weeks in office in the wake of 
a sex scandal and a severe loss in the july 23 election for the 
upper house of parliament uno was accused of keeping paid 
mistresses 
kaifu belongs to one of the smallest factions in the 
conservative governing party a position that normally would have 
made him an unlikely choice for high office in addition he has 
not held the key cabinet posts or top party jobs that are normally 
part of a prime ministers background 
but leaders of all the bigger party factions are tainted by 
responsibility for the election defeat or by a bribery scandal that 
toppled unos predecessor noboru takeshita 
i hope i can get as much support from the party as possible 
kaifu told reporters after his faction united behind him im 
overwhelmed by the honor and will do my best 
he said it was too early to answer questions about details of 
his policy ideas but political reform is the biggest issue that 
has been raised by the people he said 
party members have called for political reform to help restore 
public trust eroded by the bribery scandal 
kaifu acknowledged he had accepted political donations from the 
company at the hub of the scandal the recruit co information 
conglomerate 
he said recruit had contributed about 110000 to his political 
coffers over five years but the money had been properly reported 
kaifu said he stopped receiving recruit money after the scandal 
emerged last year 
kaifu a longtime member of the lower house of parliament 
belongs to the political reform committee set up by the party to 
deal with the scandal 
from 1974 to 1976 he was deputy chief cabinet secretary under 
the late prime minister takeo miki who sought to clean up japans 
money politics when he succeeded scandalplagued prime minister 
kakuei tanaka 
kaifu later served as education minister for two periods of 
about a year each 
his candidacy had been rumored since the weekend when party 
secretarygeneral ryutaro hashimotos bid began to falter 
kaifu became the clear frontrunner wednesday after his mentor 
and faction leader 78yearold toshio komoto said he had decided 
not to run 
the next prime minister must deal not only with the partys 
scandals but also with widespread opposition to a new 3 percent 
sales tax

us coast guard personnel who boarded a 
taiwanese drift net vessel suspected of involvement in a scheme to 
sell 13 million worth illegally caught fish reported wednesday 
that its holds were filled with salmon 
taiwanese enforcement officers and observers from the coast 
guard cutter morganthau boarded the sung ching no 1 early 
wednesday about 75 miles off taiwan 
the morganthau had been shadowing the sung ching no 1 for more 
than two weeks in the north pacific as the state department sought 
permission from the government of taiwan for us personnel to 
board the taiwanese initially refused then decided to dispatch 
their own law enforcement officials to the ship and allow a 
jointboarding party 
all the holds were filled with salmon said carolyn feldman 
a spokeswoman at the coast guards pacific command in alameda 
calif 
after the boarding the vessel was turned over to taiwanese 
officials 
the state department demanded that the vessels crew be 
prosecuted under taiwanese law which restricts the export of 
salmon and limits where taiwanese drift net vessels are allowed to 
fish 
the sung ching no 1 was one of at least two taiwanese drift net 
vessels implicated in the illegal sale of salmon to us undercover 
agents posing as fish buyers in a sixmonth sting operation 
last month federal agents arrested two taiwanese men as they 
emerged from a seattle bank vault carrying more than 1 million in 
cash allegedly received as payment for 500 metric tons of illegally 
caught fish 
at the same time the arrests were made the sung ching no 1 and 
another taiwanese ship were rendezvousing with the us government 
chartered fishing tender redfin north of midway island to deliver 
the fish 
when the captains of the two vessels boarded the redfin to 
arrange details of the fish transfer they were detained but their 
vessels fled as the morganthau approached 
while the morganthau tracked the sung ching no 1 the redfin 
followed the other boat for several days before running short of 
supplies and heading for alaska 
sen frank murkowski ralaska said the discovery of a huge 
quantity of salmon aboard the sung ching no 1 gives taiwanese 
authorities plenty of evidence to go along with what we have 
already provided and it is up to them to throw the book at these 
outlaws 
us fishing groups claim that illegal drift netting by vessels 
from taiwan japan and south korea has already had a serious impact 
on salmon runs in alaska washington state and oregon

federal savings and loan regulators have 
authorized the nations eighth largest thrift institution to become 
a commercial bank potentially reducing revenue to the beleaguered 
fund insuring sampl deposits by millions of dollars 
the federal home loan bank board in a decision late tuesday 
said home federal savings and loan association of san diego could 
leave the insolvent federal savings and loan insurance corp 
home federal is only one of several big sampls trying to escape 
fslic and join the federal deposit insurance corp the commercial 
bank fund which charges its members less for the same federal 
insurance of 100000 per account 
but before the sampl can become homefed bank it must secure 
permission from california sampl and bank regulators and from the 
fdic a process expected to take at least several months 
the bank boards decision is generating criticism in congress 
which hopes to pass legislation this week committing taxpayers to 
spending billions of dollars to bail out the sampl industry 
as part of the price for the bailout sampls will continue to pay 
higher insurance premiums than banks for the next five years even 
if they convert to a bank 
rep charles schumer dny a member of the house banking 
committee said regulators may have had no choice but to rule in 
favor of home federal but he added i think its awful it 
sends a terrible signal if there was a legal way to avoid the 
decision it should have been done 
home federal is hoping to get out of fslic under a provision of 
1987 banking legislation that permits institutions to leave 
provided they applied before march 31 1987 home federal filed its 
applications to the fdic and state regulators a day before the 
deadline 
it is unclear however if that loophole will still be good if 
home federal as expected is unable to complete its conversion 
before congress enacts new sampl legislation which has provisions 
that would supersede the law passed two years ago 
john buchman a bank board staff attorney said the home federal 
decision will not set a precedent favorable to several other large 
sampls trying to bolt the fslic 
two los angelesbased sampls home savings of america and great 
western the largest and secondlargest thrifts in the nation are 
also trying to leave fslic 
the bank board denied great westerns application and in june 
the thrift lost an attempt to overturn the decision in us 
district court in los angeles it is appealing the ruling 
the bank board has until october to rule on the application from 
home savings of america 
the bank board has allowed 13 other sampls to secede from the 
fslic under the 1987 law all considerably smaller than home 
federal 
home federal ranked eighth in the nation with 172 billion in 
assets at the end of may has about 200 branches throughout 
california last year it paid 137 million more in insurance 
premiums than it would have as a bank 
both bank and sampl premiums would be raised under the sampl bill 
but home federal would still pay about 9 million less in premiums 
as a bank

a senior us official will visit sudan on 
sunday to decide whether washington should freeze 108 million in 
aid because of a military coup a month ago a western official said 
herman cohen assistant secretary of state for african affairs 
is to determine whether us law requires the funding cutoff which 
would not affect about 100 million in annual humanitarian aid the 
official told foreign reporters 
section 513 to the us 1987 foreign assistance act stipulates 
that economic aid must cease to a country where a democratically 
elected government is removed in violation of the countrys 
constitution said the official on condition of anonymity 
fiji in 1986 became the first country to have its us aid 
halted under provisions of section 513 he said 
however the law known as section 513 includes a waiver 
provision related to national security interests of the united 
states he said 
cohen will explore the possibility of using the waiver 
depending on how the new sudanese government will deal with certain 
issues the official said 
he said said cohen will study the position of lt gen omar 
hassan elbashir who with other middlelevel fieldgrade officers 
overthrew sudanese prime minister sadek elmahdis government on 
june 30 
the official said cohen will gauge elbashirs stands on two key 
sore points between the united states and elmahdi one is ending 
the southern sudan civil war and the other is allowing delivery of 
relief supplies to southerners suffering from a famine the 
6yearold war has caused 
the law puts at stake 108 million committed to sudan the 
official said 
already 22 million in development and economic aid has been 
frozen since january under rules requiring it after a country faces 
back debt payments on us government loans for more than a year 
but the official stressed that neither section 513 nor that 
rule called the brooke amendment affect us humanitarian aid to 
sudan one of the worlds poorest countries that amounted to 100 
million dollars in the past year 
he said washington believes elbashir is ready to take the steps 
necessary to end the war 
president hosni mubarak who last month took over as chairman of 
the organization of african unity already began mediating between 
elbashir and the rebel sudan peoples liberation army which is 
supported by ethiopia 
exploratory peace talks are to start in the ethiopian capital 
addis ababa this week 
the western official said he believes the talks may succeed 
because both sudan and ethiopia are economically exhausted by the 
long struggle 
cohens african tour started in cairo to see how the united 
states can help mubarak as oau chairman end several regional 
african conflicts among them are those between somalia and 
mauritania and chad and libya 
africas foreign debt estimated at 250 billion is another 
item on cohens agenda during his tour which also will take him to 
ethiopia

the american red cross launched a national 
campaign wednesday aimed at preventing child deaths from choking 
suffocation and drowning 
the infant and child cpr campaign encourages parents 
grandparents baby sitters and other caregivers to learn how to 
handle breathing emergencies in infants and children 
actress lynda carter who has an 18monthold boy lent her name 
to the campaign 
theres a lot a parent can do before the ambulance arrives 
said robert burnside director of health services for the american 
red cross 
the heimlich maneuver however is not among them 
that method of using abdominal thrusts to dislodge obstructions 
in the breathing passages works on choking adults but does more 
harm than good when used on a baby burnside said 
a choking baby needs to be held in a certain way and be given a 
series of blows to the back and thrusts to the chest to restore 
breathing he said 
the technique taught in the american red cross infant and child 
cpr course was highlighted in a segment of the cbs daytime drama 
the young and the restless wednesday when a choking emergency 
occurred to a young child 
besides choking emergencies the sevenhour red cross course 
teaches mouthtomouth rescue breathing cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation and injury prevention 
thousands of children who die from choking suffocation and 
drowning could be saved if more adults knew how to respond to the 
emergencies burnside said 
choking and suffocation are leading causes of accidental deaths 
in children under 1 year old according to the johns hopkins 
university injury prevention center 
among children ages 14 drowning is the second leading cause of 
accidental deaths after motor vehicle accidents

workers at government nuclear weapons plants 
told a congressional panel wednesday they were deceived for decades 
by superiors on the health hazards of working with radioactive 
materials such as plutonium and uranium 
we were told the levels were too low to harm us said david 
day a worker and union official at the fernald uranium processing 
plant in ohio he said superiors told him over the years that 
handling the radioactive materials was like working with lead 
and no more a risk than crossing the street 
the testimony came before the senate government affairs 
committee which said there have been at least 30 studies over the 
years describing various health problems among workers and 
residents near the energy department facilities 
the historical record provides little comfort said 
committee chairman sen john glenn dohio he said workers at 
plant sites must be assured they are protected from health and 
safety dangers and be provided accurate information on health risks 
energy secretary james watkins acknowledged the departments 
program to determine the health hazards facing weapons plant 
workers is a mess he said the department has no clear picture 
of how much physical harm workers have suffered over the years from 
exposure to radioactive materials and wastes 
watkins said that when he took over the department in march he 
found the program to follow such health effects buried deep 
within the bureaucracy understaffed under funded and under 
utilized 
but he balked at suggestions by glenn and other senators that an 
outside agency should oversee the departments monitoring program 
i now its a mess i need people to clean it up more than i need 
oversight right now watkins testified 
the departments own information is so bad said watkins he has 
relied heavily on outside scientific review panels 
sometimes the reports coming in from the field are not really 
true said the secretary 
he said statistical information on past worker exposure to 
radiation at and near the plants is being examined again to more 
accurately guage the health risks he also said information on the 
health of 600000 present and past plant workers is being assembled 
and will be made available to outside scientists but the central 
data bank is not expected to be completed until 1995 
the secretary promised a shakeup in the departments health 
monitoring program and said it would be opened to review by an 
outside committee of experts 
a panel of plant workers and union representatives voiced 
similar concerns 
the history of the energy department on health and safety issues 
is one of denial coverup inefficiency and betrayal declared 
robert wages a vice president of the oil chemical and atomic 
workers union the union represents 5000 workers at various 
nuclear weapons facilities 
wages said questions about worker safety and exposure to 
hazardous materials was raised nearly two decades ago in 
congressional hearings and elsewhere but nothing changed 
wages and other union officials as well as several present 
employees at plants said too often workers have kept silent for 
fear of losing their jobs and because of repeated assurances that 
the health concerns were being exaggerated by critics 
we are the guinea pigs we perform important and dangerous 
work but are made to feel expendable said jesse abney 55 a 
chemical operator at the fernald plant in ohio 
tests have shown abney to have plutonium in his body and uranium 
in his lungs 
despite my precautions at work over the years i am 
contaminated he told the senators and noted rumors the 
government may close the fernald plant in the near future 
will i be able to find another job and still support my 
family would another company be willing to cover me under their 
health insurance he asked

elementaryschool teachers are underreporting 
childabuse cases because they arent adequately trained to 
recognize or deal with them according to a study released 
wednesday 
fiftyseven percent of the more than 21 million reports of 
child abuse and neglect in 1986 involved schoolage children but 
only 163 percent of all reports filed with childprotective 
agencies originated with school personnel said the study by the 
national committee for prevention of child abuse 
the results of the survey point out a major problem in our 
efforts to prevent child abuse said committee executive director 
anne h cohn 
all states require teachers to report instances of child abuse 
ms cohn said 
but the committees survey found that only 50 percent of the 480 
elementaryschool teachers polled had received any training in the 
identification reporting and prevention of such cases she said 
most who said they received such training said it was inadequate 
the teachers surveyed taught first grade through sixth grade in 
39 school districts nationwide ms cohn said 
the chicagobased committee described as a national 
volunteerbased organization tried to assess teachers knowledge 
attitudes and beliefs about child abuse as well as their opinions 
on reporting child abuse and on prevention programs 
seventytwo percent of the teachers surveyed said they suspected 
that at least one of their students had been abused or neglected 
and 90 percent said they had reported such cases ms cohn said 
however reports commonly went to other school personnel such 
as a principal social worker or nurse only about 20 percent of 
the teachers said they reported abuse directly to childprotective 
agencies as required by most states laws 
only 57 percent of those polled said their districts had clearly 
defined polices on reporting suspicions of child abuse twentyfour 
percent didnt know if their districts had such policies although 
95 percent of the nations districts say they have clearly set 
guidelines for teachers to follow ms cohn said 
not only are many teachers unaware of the existence of those 
school policies but many do not seem to understand the policies 
that do exist she said 
according to the survey teachers are concerned about the legal 
ramifications of reporting child abuse even though most states 
grant immunity from lawsuits to teachers who report childabuse 
suspicions in good faith ms cohn said 
ms cohn said her organization believes administrators need to 
dramatically expand the education they provide their teachers so 
that teachers can feel much more comfortable and much more 
competent in their ability to identify and report child abuse 
the survey also asked teachers about corporal punishment and 
found that 57 percent felt it should be eliminated 
robert fathman chairman of the national coalition to abolish 
corporal punishment in schools said the drive to stop corporal 
punishment received a big boost this year with eight states 
banning the practice 
for the first time in the history of our countrys education 
system more than half of the school children in the us now 
attend schools that have prohibited hitting slapping punching 
hairpulling paddling or other firms of corporal punishment by 
educators fathman said

china is forecast to become a net importer of 
rice for the first time in recent history helping create a record 
worldwide trade in rice in 1989 the agriculture department said 
wednesday 
the report rice situation and outlook yearbook says 
china indonesia and india are fueling this years record demand 
with trade forecast at 134 million metric tons 
the previous record was 131 million metric tons set in 1981 
the report said 
although the united states will increase its exports 10 percent 
this year to 25 million metric tons thailand will be the big 
winner exporting a record 55 million metric tons 
the us share of the export 19 percent and the thai share 41 
percent will be the same as last year the usda said 
china has already bought 950000 tons from thailand which has 
been exporting rice at an extraordinary pace since august 1988 
the report said china is expected to buy 12 million tons of rice 
this year from all sources the report said that is triple the 
amount bought the previous year 
the report said it is unclear how or if the current turmoil in 
china will affect its shortterm rice trade 
there have been few reports of exports in the first half of 
1989 and china is forecast to export only 300000 tons by the end 
of the year less than half the amount it exported in 1988 the 
report said 
china india and indonesia will also account for about a 5 
percent drop in the 1990 market when their crops improve and stocks 
are replenished india and china account for over 50 percent of the 
worlds rice production 
china imports rice to feed its urban populations in the 
forecast for 1990 contained in the report the department cites 
reports that farmers will keep more rice on the farm because of the 
government system of paying farmers with ious that cannot be 
redeemed immediately 
indonesia is forecast to import 400000 tons and india will 
likely take in 500000 tons the report says 
china and india are expecting record crops in the crop year 
19891990 
arkansas california louisiana mississippi missouri and texas 
are the main ricegrowing states the main us customers are 
europe the middle east south america and africa 
low stocks and strong import demand caused world prices to soar 
starting in january they reached 891 per hundredweight in july 
after having fallen to 590 in december 1988 recent prices were 
at their lowest in 19861987 when abundant world prices kept them 
down as far as 378 a hundredweight 
us farmers are planting 28 million acres in rice this year 5 
percent less than a year ago the department estimates yields are 
unlikely to show improvement meaning a drop in production the 
department says

a un official went to southern lebanon 
wednesday to press the search for the body of a slain american 
hostage as a glimmer of hope came from the shiite moslem camp that 
a second hostage would be spared 
the victim us marine lt col william r higgins was on un 
duty when he was abducted 
shiite sources said they expected kidnappers threatening the 
life of joseph cicippio 58 of norristown pa to spare him at 
irans behest to avert a confrontation with the united states 
proiranian kidnappers said they hanged higgins on monday in 
retaliation for israels abduction friday of a lebanese shiite 
cleric the colonel was seized feb 17 1988 near tyre in south 
lebanon 
the vatican said pope john paul ii at president bushs request 
would assist in efforts to have higgins body returned to the 
united states 
bush said wednesday he is leaving no stone unturned in 
trying to free american hostages but lacks hard information as he 
tries to deal with the crisis in a prudent way 
he said he contacted many world leaders and we have had 
assurance after assurance they want to help 
british officials in london said bush and prime minister 
margaret thatcher talked for 20 minutes about the crisis 
a videotape the kidnappers provided shows a man apparently 
higgins hanging from a gallows no body has been found and there 
is no way of knowing when the tape was made some reports have said 
higgins was killed months ago 
pentagon officials said the uss belknap flagship of the us 
6th fleet and the fleet commander canceled a visit to sevastopol 
in the soviet union in case bush needs them but said a military 
strike was unlikely the aircraft carrier america cut short a visit 
to singapore they said 
marrack goulding un undersecretarygeneral for peacekeeping 
operations flew to un headquarters in the lebanese border town 
of naqoura by helicopter from israel 
he met with maj gen larseric wahlgren swedish commander of 
the un interim force in lebanon and battalion commanders of the 
ninenation force known as unifil to investigate higgins death and 
try to find his body 
unifil spokesman timor goksel said goulding put off going to 
beirut because of the fighting but would try to make the trip 
thursday christian forces and a syrianled moslem alliance have 
fought an artillery war in beirut for five months 
the undersecretarygeneral is scheduled to meet with lebanese 
leaders in beirut but goksel would not identify them 
there are no negotiations involved although he has a 
secondary mission of trying to find out about other hostages in 
lebanon the spokesman said 
sixteen westerners are captives in lebanon including eight 
americans held longest is terry a anderson chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press kidnapped march 16 1985 
higgins 44 commanded a 75man observer team attached to the 
5800member unifil force 
cicippios captors who call themselves the revolutionary 
justice organization said monday he would be killed unless israel 
freed sheik abdul karim obeid by 6 pm the next day 
two hours after the tuesday deadline the kidnappers announced a 
nonextendable postponement of 48 hours no specific hour on 
thursday was mentioned as a new deadline 
the statement cited a plea for mercy from cicippios lebanese 
wife elham and other friendly appeals and sincere behests 
mrs cicippio said wednesday even if it was a postponement 
for only one minute its better than nothing 
shiite sources said iran might have stepped in to save cicippio 
because of the international uproar created by higgins death 
an organization caling itself the organization of the oppressed 
on earth claimed to hold higgins 
nearly all the groups holding hostages are believed to be fronts 
for hezbollah or party of god a shiite movement in which obeid is 
a spiritual leader 
israel has offered to exchange obeid and other shiite prisoners 
for the foreign hostages and three of its soldiers held prisoner in 
lebanon but hezbollah rejected the deal 
moshe arens the israeli foreign minister said wednesday there 
was a good possibility hostages would be freed but other 
officials said negotiations could be lengthy 
iran sponsors hezbollah which also holds two of the three 
israeli soldiers 
israeli commandos abducted obeid 33 and two aides from his 
home in jibchit a south lebanon village 
hezbollah denies any connection with the hostages but publicly 
endorsed the oppressed on earth group when it claimed 
responsibility for higgins abduction 
one lebanese shiite source said the iranians probably are 
bringing immense pressure on their lebanese surrogates seeking to 
defuse the crisis generated by higgins murder they can do without 
a showdown with the united states 
hashemi rafsanjani just elected president of iran has sought 
improved relations with the west in the past in hopes of aid in 
rebuilding from eight years of war with iraq 
other shiite sources said the emergence of rafsanjani as irans 
most powerful politician had meant a decline in the influence over 
hezbollah of a hardline rival interior minister ali akbar 
mohtashemi 
analysts say the hostages fate may be dictated by the struggle 
between those known as pragmatists led by rafsanjani and 
hardliners over the direction of irans 10yearold islamic 
revolution 
the first shiite source noted that revolutionary justice is not 
known to have killed a hostage but has issued death threats in the 
past 
the revolutionary justice statement announcing the 48hour 
postponement for cicippio was accompanied by a picture of another 
american hostage it holds writer edward austin tracy 58 
statements from the group threatened both mens lives twice in 
1988 
cicippio was acting comptroller of the american university of 
beirut when he was abducted from its campus on sept 12 1986

a us man whose costa rican ranch allegedly served 
as a way station for gunsfordrugs trades to aid the contra rebels 
surfaced here wednesday after fleeing an indictment in that central 
american nation 
john hull who was out on 37500 bond on charges he violated 
costa rican neutrality and trafficked in cocaine said he slipped 
away about a week ago 
the drug counts were dropped wednesday by a judge but the 
neutrality charges remain 
in the united states the 69yearold rancher faces a subpoena 
by a senate subcommittee looking into similar charges as well as a 
justice department investigation into an allegation he fraudulently 
obtained a 375000 us development loan 
hull vehemently denied all the accusations wednesday in an 
interview with the associated press saying the charges against him 
were really charges against the us government 
the costa ricans are accusing the united states government 
the cia the past president and the current president of being drug 
traffickers he said 
the former evansville ind resident who has lived in costa 
rica for 20 years said he was just a patriotic american who 
gave humanitarian aid to the contras seeking to overthrow 
nicaraguas sandinista government 
he said the accusations had been pushed by communists and drug 
people 
us prosecutors say they have no evidence to support the drug 
charges but insist hull was more active than he admits in helping 
former national security council aide oliver north aid the contras 
even after congress cut off funding

leader adolfo calero to feed and supply the rebels but denies 
knowing the money was provided on norths orders 
hull also denied working for the national security council 
saying owen was simply an old friend he knew through the office 
of thensen dan quayle rind 
however he said he had frequent contact with cia agents 
constantly there were cia people passing through the zone 
he said they would visit my house they would ask questions 
about locations of farms it was obvious they were wanting 
information about air drops and so forth 
the same as any patriotic american would do i cooperated with 
the agencies of my government hull said

headed by sen john kerry dmass that airstrips on his ranch 
were used as refueling and transfer stations by pilots bringing in 
guns for the contras and taking cocaine and marijuana back to the 
united states 
convicted drug traffickers jorge morales and gary betzner 
testified that they used hulls ranch for cocaine flights other 
witnesses including former panamanian official jose blandon said 
they knew of drugs passing through hulls ranch

just an attempt to win lighter sentences 
kerry counsel jonathan winer said the subcommittee wanted to 
talk to hull as soon as possible 
hull is under subpoena and has been for a year and we will 
seek to serve him winer said weve sought to serve him 
before but he has been in costa rica and from our point of view 
evading the subpoena 
hull said he was willing to talk however he has accused kerry 
of being a communist and according to the subcommittee at one 
point tried to stall the panels investigation by filing a flood of 
false affidavits with the justice department 
hull may also have to talk to the justice department about 
alleged fraud involving a 1983 loan from the us overseas private 
investment corp 
hull blamed the agency rather than himself for any confusion 
over the 375000 loan and insisted it has been paid back 
hull saying he suffers from a heart condition and diabetes 
said he mainly returned to the united states to seek medical 
treatment he said he has no money and intends to return to 
indiana until he is treated 
then i want to return to costa rica he said i have faith 
in the costa rican judicial system

top administration officials met wednesday 
with environmental leaders to discuss criticisms of president 
bushs clean air plan won praise for keeping an open white house 
door but received no blanket commitment of support 
bush and his environmental advisory team invited the 
environmentalists to discuss the acid rain provision of the clean 
air package and promised later meetings on the airborne toxics and 
urban smog sections which have prompted the most criticism from 
environmental activists and members of congress 
the environmental defense fund which has praised bushs 
proposal to curb acid rain will lobby for that aspect of the 
presidents package on capitol hill spokesman fred krupp said 
after the white house session 
he said the acid rain portion is stronger than anything being 
offered in competing legislation in congress he praised bush for 
taking leadership on the environment that represented a sea 
change from the reagan administration 
but richard ayres of the national resources defense council 
said his organization still has reservations about the provisions 
in part focusing on the way the white house calculated gaseous 
emissions that cause acid rain 
the administration claims its plan will result in a 10 
millionton reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions from 1980 levels 
but the nrdcs calculations are it will be only 9 million tons 
since 1 million ton reduction has already been achieved 
the meeting was the latest effort by the administration to take 
the offensive on its clean air bill after weeks of criticism from 
environmental groups and their congressional backers 
bush dropped by the meeting only briefly participants said 
environmental protection agency assistant administrator william 
rosenberg said the meeting was called to continue the dialogue 
with environmental groups 
however he insisted the administration was not positioning to 
make changes in the bill it sent to congress last month 
were talking about clarifying our position their position 
sometimes there are interpretation questions that need to be raised 
where we say one thing and different people read it for different 
results at this point its an information discussion and not a 
negotiating session the administrations bill stands as it is 
he said 
last week rosenberg accused democrats in congress of making 
unfair and totally biased attacks on the legislation and of 
falsely calling the proposal a sellout to industry 
ayres said the administration officials at the meeting were 
very upset by the criticism the bill has got from the 
environmental community and members of congress we responded with 
equal vehemence that we dont think youve been unfairly attacked 
we believe what were saying is based on the facts 
administration officials have complained that the environmental 
critics are nitpicking the bill after the administration solicited 
their views and addressed many of their concerns in the package 
they certainly would like us to be more positive than we have 
been i would like to be more positive than weve been able to 
be ayres said 
paul pritchard president of the national parks and conservation 
foundation praised the administration for continued consultation 
with the environmentalists 
clearly they were stating that they were opening the door and 
its up to us to work with them he said 
but a number of organizations in the main environmental lobbying 
group the national clean air coalition were not invited 
including the natural resources defense council environmental 
action the american lung association and the aflcio 
ayres director of the coalition said he was invited only 15 
minutes before the session after he complained to administration 
officials 
but white house spokesman steve hart said it had been thought 
that ayres might be more appropriately invited to the later 
sessions on urban smog and toxics than to wednesdays meeting on 
acid rain 
an epa source speaking only on condition he not be named said 
the white house issued the invitations and both epa administrator 
william reilly and rosenberg were shocked that ayres was not 
invited the source said the two epa officials demanded that the 
white house invite ayres 
the point they may have misjudged somewhat is that the 
coalition works together ayres said i speak for the 
coalition 
the director of environmental action casey padgett accused the 
white house of trying to fracture the coalition 
others invited included representatives of the wilderness 
society conservation foundation national wildlife foundation 
sierra club and national audubon society

venceremos the guerrilla radio station said the attacks on 
towns were part of a rebel campaign against the fascist 
government of president alfredo cristiani and increases in 
transportation costs and repression in general 
cristianis conservative administration lifted price controls on 
about 200 consumer items and services earlier this week including 
transportation and electricity in an effort to revive the 
warbattered economy 
bus fares increased wednesday in some cases to almost double 
their former levels new electricity rates will be announced next

officials who leak information to news 
reporters about federal criminal investigations may be prosecuted 
for theft of government property under a new policy announced 
wednesday by the justice department 
the department has decided to narrow a 11yearold policy 
against prosecuting officials who leak information to inform the 
public john c keeney a deputy assistant attorney general in the 
criminal division said in written testimony submitted to a 
congressional hearing 
in some circumstances reporters may be called to testify at 
grand juries to identify leakers although a subpoena would not be 
issued without the approval of the attorney general keeney said 
this aspect of the new policy which was unveiled at a joint 
hearing of two house judiciary subcommittees means the change 
could have little practical effect on leak investigations 
attorneys general historically have been unwilling to subpoena 
reporters who are usually the only source of evidence about who 
leaked them information 
but the new policy drew expressions of concern from civil 
libertarians who said it could be used to undermine a reporters 
first amendment protection against revealing confidential sources 
of information 
once the government is able to say we need this information 
because its material to a criminal investigation that raises the 
question of whether or not the protection of a confidential source 
is diluted said allan adler a washington media lawyer and 
former legislative counsel to the american civil liberties union 
i think it would be a definite misuse of the statute the 
statute was not designed with that in mind at all said rep don 
edwards dcalif chairman of one of the subcommittees it would 
be a very dangerous practice 
the policy in force since 1978 stated that it is inappropriate 
to bring a prosecution under the theft of government property law 
if information is leaked to inform the public and wasnt obtained 
by illegal means such as wiretaps or trespassing keeney said in 
testimony prepared for the committee 
the guideline contained in the united states attorneys manual 
was designed to protect whistleblowers and also to protect 
members of the media from prosecution for receipt of stolen 
property 
we have examined this policy and concluded it is too broad 
keeney said accordingly it is no longer applicable to government 
employees who leak information obtained from a criminal 
investigation 
moreover we will now consider prosecution of government 
employees under section 641 the theft statute in leak cases not 
arising out of criminal investigations if the employees conduct 
also violated some other provision such as the privacy act 
keeney said in his prepared statement 
such a leak could come from an fbi background investigation of 
someone under consideration for a cabinet position such as former 
sen john tower rtexas whose nomination to be defense secretary 
was killed amidst allegations of womanizing and drinking 
leaks of information from the fbi background investigation of 
tower drew criticism from congress and expressions of consternation 
by the bush administration 
keeney said the department is in the process of deciding 
whether the policy should be changed in other respects 
leslie harris legislative counsel at the aclu called keeneys 
announcement rather disturbing 
keeneys testimony was delivered at a hearing convened in the 
wake of congressional concern about leaks revealing a justice 
department investigation into financial irregularities in the 
office of rep william h gray iii dpa 
the investigation was disclosed during grays ultimately 
successful campaign to become house majority whip news reports of 
the gray case prompted attorney general dick thornburgh to order a 
leak investigation

luiz gonzaga a singer and 
accordion player who almost singlehandedly popularized the lilting 
music of brazils rural northeast died wednesday of pneumonia he 
was 76 
gonzaga suffered from osteoporosis a disease that weakens the 
bones and had been hospitalized for more than a month in recife 
1500 miles northeast of rio hospital officials said by telephone 
gonzaga was born dec 13 1912 in the remote town of exu in the 
heart of the arid sertao or outback 
his father taught him to play the accordion a popular 
instrument in brazils rural northeast and at 12 he was performing 
regularly at local dances in the 1940s he came to rio where 
regional music then was virtually unknown 
at first considered lowbrow gonzaga popularized the baiao 
and forro music with his moon face and trademark leather hat 
typical of northeastern bandits gonzaga became a nationally known 
figure 
his music dealt almost exclusively with the hard life in the 
poor northeast his greatest success was asa branca or white 
wing about a peasant regretfully fleeing the droughtstricken 
backlands but pledging to return when the rains came 
gonzagas body was to be taken back to exu for burial on friday

house and senate negotiators will meet in 
september on legislation that would impose a 14month ceasefire in 
the battle over the ancient forests of oregon and washington state 
lawmakers said wednesday 
the lawmakers said the delay until after congress august recess 
would give them more time to try to negotiate a compromise 
acceptable to both the timber industry and environmentalists 
if we can come up with a way to get the job done and soften 
some of the criticism we will certainly be looking for that 
said rep norman dicks dwash 
the conference committee had originally been scheduled to meet 
this week to discuss the spending bills for the interior department 
and related agencies passed by the house and senate 
congress is scheduled to recess at the end of the week until 
after labor day 
environmentalists oppose the legislation which would limit 
their access to the courts to appeal timber sales during the 
14month grace period and plan to use the month before the 
conference committee meets to lobby against it 
they say logging in the oldgrowth forests of the northwest 
destroys prime nesting areas for the rare northern spotted owl 
illinois democratic rep sidney yates chairman of the house 
appropriations interior subcommittee put of the meeting of the 
housesenate conference committee because of major differences in 
the versions of the spending bills adopted by the two chambers 
the timber legislation is included as an amendment to the 
senatepassed version of the interior spending bill but not the 
one approved by the house 
lawmakers said the legislation should ensure a shortterm supply 
of timber for the regions mills while protecting the oldgrowth 
forests from logging a permanent fix would still have to be 
negotiated 
the legislation would bar federal courts from suspending or 
overturning any timber sales planned in federal forests of the 
northwest known to contain spotted owls through the end of fiscal 
1990 
in addition the legislation requires that environmentalists 
release more than half of the roughly two billion board feet of 
timber currently enjoined from sale 
if environmentalists do not agree to release the timber by oct 
1 the legislation would allow the forest service and the bureau of 
land management to proceed with sales regardless of the injunctions

a sri lankan woman has forfeited 75000 worth of 
sapphires she put up as a deposit and still owes 100000 after 
failing to meet the deadline to buy a bankrupt college for 10 
million officials said wednesday 
were kind of back to square one its for sale again 
said bankruptcy court trustee duke salisbury 
predominantly black bishop college was closed by us bankruptcy 
judge robert c mcguire last year when officials of the 
108yearold school couldnt raise 185 million needed to cover 
this school years deficit 
the school which sits on a 200acre plot in south dallas was 
saddled with 18 million in debt faculty and staff had worked 
without pay for about two years and are owed about 900000 a 
portion of the land has been appraised at about 126 million 
in april a contract to purchase the school was awarded to 
aryadesh inc a group represented by panditha sujatha nadarajah a 
sri lankan woman whose attorney said she had lived in lubbock since 
1985 
ms nadarajah is an internationally known buddhist scholar and 
planned to open an international university at the school her 
attorney aw clem said in march 
ms nadarajah put up five sapphires worth 75000 to seal the 
deal and agreed to pay an additional 100000 to get a fourweek 
extension of the original july 4 deadline 
after missing tuesdays deadline to come up with the 10 million 
to buy the college salisbury said ms nadarajah has forfeited the 
jewels but has yet to pay the 100000 
we will have to make demands upon her for the 100000 cash 
said salisbury 
proceeds from the sale of the jewels will go to creditors of the 
college salisbury said 
ms nadarajah returned to sri lanka in july to raise the money 
and raoul smyth an attorney for salisbury said she apparently has 
had trouble getting out of the island nation off the coast of india 
sri lanka has been wracked by two years of fighting between 
sinhalese extremists angered by peace overtures made to the 
countrys tamil minority and by the continuing presence of indian 
peacekeeping troops and the sinhalesedominated government 
when salisbury recommended awarding the contract to ms 
nadarajah he said we have investigated her as best we can it 
seems that she does indeed have the money 
ms nadarajahs attorney did not return phone calls wednesday 
salisbury said he already had at least 10 inquiries about buying 
the college wednesday morning and hopes media attention will die 
down 
ive never had to conduct a business negotiation in front 
of the likes of the media he said

the house moved wednesday to speed easy 
passage of a taxpayer bailout of savings and loan losses as senate 
republicans mounted a final attempt to prevent the costs from 
swelling the federal deficit 
the house rules committee set aside one hour of debate for 
thursday before a floor vote anticipated to occur by noon puts 
the legislations fate in the hands of senators deeply divided on 
how to raise the 50 billion needed to close 500 insolvent sampls and 
pay off their depositors 
senate and house negotiators from both parties agreed last week 
to president bushs recommended massive overhaul of the way the 
government regulates the nations nearly 3000 thrift institutions 
and house republicans generally have folded their opposition to 
democratic demands that the rescue money be borrowed through the 
treasury a move that would swell the deficit by some 9 billion 
this year and 24 billion in fiscal 1990 
however the parties are deadlocked in the senate where 41 
republicans one more than needed to thwart the bills approval 
have said in a letter they would hold out for bushs elaborate 
financing scheme 
that effort was being led by sen phil gramm rtexas coauthor 
of the 1985 grammrudman deficit reduction law mandating a federal 
deficit no greater than 110 billion for the next fiscal year 
beginning oct 1 
bushs bailout plan would raise the deficit at most only 5 
billion a year by borrowing the money through higherinterest bonds 
on the private market critics contend the higher interest rates 
would cost taxpayers a total of 45 billion more than necessary 
over the next 30 years 
senate gop leader bob dole of kansas on tuesday threatened to 
tie the sampl measure to a bill raising the governments debt ceiling 
above 28 trillion as a parliamentary tactic if the house tried to 
recess for the rest of the month before the senate votes 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash however said wednesday 
he has no intention of recessing until after both the house and the 
senate have acted on the sampl bill as well as the debt ceiling 
sen warren rudman rnh another coauthor of the 
deficitreduction law said he remains solidly with gramm but added 
he did not know about the other 39 gop senators who had signed the 
texas republicans letter 
i dont know what the vote count is i dont think anybody 
does rudman said 
however support for gramm and the administrations efforts was 
clearly waning among house republicans 
i understand the administrations concern but its a hard 
thing to sell when you get everything else in place and have it 
hung up on that one issue said house gop leader bob michel of 
illinois weve got some problems with our counterparts in the 
senate

divers on wednesday found the bodies of three 
men aboard a drilling rig that capsized while fleeing hurricane 
chantal and the search continued for seven missing crewmen 
officials said 
the search of the floating rig which overturned monday was 
delayed earlier in the day by strong currents and high seas 
the bodies were recovered from the vessels crew quarters said 
chevron spokesman jonathan lifa 
coast guard officials earlier speculated that crewmen may have 
survived the accident if they were trapped in the watertight crew 
quarters but did not estimate how long the men could live on a 
limited amount of air 
lifa said he didnt know what condition the crew quarters were 
in 
the names of the dead were being withheld pending notification 
of their families lifa said 
the search had to be abandoned monday because of high seas and 
strong wind stirred up by chantal chevron which had leased the 
rig and hired the rescue divers and the coast guard sent vessels 
to resume the search tuesday after chantal blew ashore in texas and 
weakened to a tropical depression 
there were conflicting reports about where the missing men were 
last seen in the water or in the watertight crews quarters 
submerged in about 30 feet of water said coast guard petty 
officer glenn lamont in new orleans 
the technical name for the rig is a lift boat it has 
retractable legs that anchor it to the sea bottom when in use and 
raise out of the way to allow the rig to be floated to a new 
location 
the legs were retracted and it was headed to shore early monday 
trying to avoid chantal when it capsized 
three survivors were taken aboard a fishing vessel monday and a 
fourth was rescued by helicopter

several angry relatives of victims lost in the 
downing of pan am flight 103 renewed their demand for a 
wideranging congressional investigation wednesday saying their 
pleas for more information have been virtually ignored 
it is now four months since we met with president bush and all 
100 senators to request an investigation of the weak security and 
the failure to act on highlevel warnings issued to the faa the 
state department and the airline before the dec 21 incident 
said paul hudson father of melina hudson one of the victims 
we are surprised and disappointed that the bush administration 
has adamantly opposed a congressional investigation or the 
appointment of a special commission at every turn hudson told a 
news conference 
we also cannot understand why congress has delayed taking any 
action on their commitment to conduct a fullscale investigation of 
this the worst act of terrorism against civilians in our 
history he said 
investigators believe a midflight explosion downed the jet over 
lockerbie scotland killing 270 people including 189 americans 
bush told the relatives earlier this year he had asked 
transportation secretary samuel skinner to work with them on a 
review of airline security procedures 
but in his statement wednesday hudson asked is it fear of 
what might be disclosed as to the culpability of our allies or is 
this another example of nonaction in the war against terrorism by 
the us government 
rosemary wolfe stepmother of pan am victim miriam wolfe said 
we need an investigation now and urge the 60 to 70 senators and 
many members of the house who have told us they support an 
investigation to pass legislation now

a leading chinese intellectual believed to be 
a key link between deposed communist party chief zhao ziyang and 
the crushed student movement has escaped to the west an activist 
said wednesday 
chen yizi fled china to france several weeks ago on an 
underground railroad the hong kong activist said chen about 
50 was director of the institute of restructuring the economy an 
influential think tank when zhao was in power 
while in paris chen participated in meetings to form an 
overseas organization to push for democracy in china said the 
activist who spoke on condition of anonymity 
chen did not meet journalists nor were reporters informed of 
his presence in paris indeed some western reports said he had 
been arrested in beijing 
the hong kong activist who insisted on anonymity said chen 
remained in the west but declined to reveal his whereabouts there 
was no way to confirm the report by the activist but he has been 
reliable in the past 
several weeks ago an official at chens institute said he was 
resting 
so far the activist said about 30 people have fled china via 
the railroad among them have been essayist yan jiaqi and 
student leader wuer kaixi both of whom were in paris with chen 
they since have gone to the united states others such as marxist 
scholar su shaozhi fled china by other means 
a western diplomat in hong kong has said beijing authorities 
apparently wanted to use chen to prove that zhao had direct ties to 
the student movement his escape would complicate those efforts 
the activist said 
chen apparently met with student leaders during their twomonth 
movement for sweeping political change in china 
in a speech july 6 beijing mayor chen xitong criticized chen by 
name for presiding at a may 19 meeting during which pariticipants 
urged publicizing the inside story of the decisionmaking of the 
top leadership 
on may 20 martial law was declared in beijing the movement was 
crushed on june 3 and 4 when thousands of chinese soldiers entered 
the capital and killed hundreds perhaps thousands of unarmed city 
residents and students 
the western diplomat said chinese authorities wanted to prove 
chen conducted the meetings at the behest of bao tong zhaos 
former righthand man 
bao a member of the central committee of the communist party 
and director of the research center for reform of the political 
structure another prozhao thinktank was placed under house 
arrest shortly after the crackdown 
if the link between bao and chen could be established communist 
authorities would be able to implicate zhao directly in the student 
movement the western diplomat said 
so far the charges against zhao have been relatively vague 
the former chief of the communist party zhao was officially 
purged after the june 4 crackdown and accused of supporting the 
movement and counterrevolutionary turmoil more recently the 
staterun media have accused him being responsible for high prices 
and widespread corruption 
zhaos real involvement in the student movement is unclear 
his sympathy for the movement was obvious when he went to 
tiananmen square in midmay and with tears in his eyes told the 
students that he had come to see them too late 
the movement was supported by many intellectuals like chen yizhi 
and yan jiaqi who worked in thinktanks tied to zhao but it is 
unknown whether they were functioning under zhaos orders or acting 
on their own 
the hong kong activist said he looked on chens escape as a 
major victory against the current crackdown on the movement 
thousands of students and other participants in the campaign for 
freedom have been arrested since the repression began in early june 
the official media which started out reporting every major new 
arrest with headlines have stopped highlighting such activity the 
apparent arrest of student leader wang dan received no mention in 
the chinese press

ivan klima a dissident writer said in prague about 20 
colleagues gathered on tuesday and elected a new pen governing 
board klima said both he and havel were on the panel which also 
included authors sanctioned by czechoslovias strict communist 
regime 
klima was banned after a sovietled invasion crushed the 1968 
prague spring of reforms the czech branch of the international 
writers club became dormant around 1971 after purges of communist 
party members including many writers 
dissident sources and a west german embassy spokesman in prague 
said havel was detained wednesday while on his way to the embassy 
for lunch with ambassador hermann huber 
it was the second day in a row havel was picked up police 
detained him for about three hours tuesday 
sources in prague said by telephone they did not know whether 
havel was released later wednesday 
in bonn west german foreign ministry spokesman otto lampe said 
his government considered the detention an extremely serious 
incident and had lodged a formal protest 
havel was sentenced to eight months in jail earlier this year 
but released on parole about midway through the term after domestic 
and foreign protests 
on tuesday klima said police freed havel in time for him to 
appear at the end of the meeting 
he said police summoned two members of the human rights group 
charter 77 eva kanturkova and milan simecka for questioning at 
the same time as the meeting so they were unable to attend 
ctk the official czechoslovak news agency reported the pen 
reorganization briefly 
klima said the 10 members of the new board included six 
dissident or nonconformist writers and four who were officially 
sanctioned ctk did not mentioned the boards makeup

what klima described as a compromise 
reviving the pen chapter is the first joint officialdissident 
literary venture in almost 20 years klima said he hoped the club 
could negotiate with authorities on publishing forbidden books and 
lifting bans on writers 
authorities have made small moves in the past year toward 
artistic liberalization books by franz kafka have appeared for 
only the second time since the prague spring and bans were 
removed from several movies plays and rock bands 
officials say havel and some other writers have remained under 
prohibition because of their refusal to renounce political 
activities 
in may the 60chapter international pen association voted 
unanmously to admit a soviet chapter ending a long quarrel with 
moscow 
soviet participation in the 10000member group has been an 
issue since pen turned down an application in 1924 
pen champions freedom of expression for writers and had stayed 
out of the soviet union because of its persecution of writers and 
other intellectuals the change of heart came after mikhail s 
gorbachev introduced more liberal policies

attorney general dick thornburgh said 
wednesday that william lucas didnt win senate judiciary committee 
approval to be civil rights chief because he failed a litmus 
test on discrimination issues 
the attorney general said he discounted the significance of 
criticism by several democrats that lucas lacked expertise for the 
job saying the detroit republican lost tuesdays vote because he 
refused to criticize recent supreme court decisions on civil rights 
that was the reason expressed by one of the members of the 
judiciary committe on the democratic side thornburgh said 
his reason for not supporting mr lucas was that mr lucas 
supported the recent supreme court decisions on civil rights the 
attorney general said in an apparent reference to sen paul simon 
dill 
civil rights lawyers have bemoaned the court decisions they say 
will make it harder for discrimination victims to win bias suits in 
court 
thornburgh said mr lucas supported the views of the president 
and the attorney general in this regard when he testified that no 
legislation was needed at this time to overturn the rulings 
i find it somewhat bizarre to expect an appointee of the 
president to begin his career in opposition to the president in an 
important area of the law thornburgh said 
the fact that they have laid down as a litmus test that the 
prospective nominee must refuse to support supreme court decisions 
will make it difficult for us to walk the fine line that that view 
implies the attorney general said 
before tuesdays vote simon cited lucas support of the high 
court rulings during confirmation hearings as his reason for voting 
against the nomination 
but other democrats said lucas lack of legal experience and 
knowledge of civil rights laws was the basis for their votes 
against the nomination 
simon said lucas views on the supreme court rulings are not 
the test but his answers were a symptom 
bill lucas is a fine person simon said but the chief 
civil rights enforcement officer of the land must have a firm grasp 
of the laws he oversees and a firm commitment to vigorously enforce 
those laws 
lucas 61 a former sheriff and chief executive of wayne county 
mich has never tried a court case the panel refused tuesday on a 
pair of 77 votes to recommend lucas nomination or send it to the 
senate floor for further consideration 
the votes virtually killed lucas chances for senate 
confirmation but thornburgh said the justice department was 
considering the option of giving lucas a socalled recess 
appointment after congress goes out of session friday 
i think we are going to look at every option and consult with 
the white house the attorney general told reporters after 
testifying before the senate foreign relations committee 
congressional and white house sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity say it is unlikely that president bush would antagonize 
the senate by appointing lucas to the job while congress takes its 
summer recess such an interim appointment would be in effect until 
congress adjournment in 1990 
but presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said we are still 
assessing our options 
an official said the administration is also considering whether 
to name lucas to another post that does not require senate approval 
thornburgh said the justice department still has a pool of 
applicants for the job of assistant attorney general for civil 
rights from which lucas name was selected 
those will be reevaluated in the light of his failure to get 
a vote on the senate floor thornburgh said 
the threat of a recess appointment could backfire under senate 
rules all nominations awaiting confirmation are sent back to the 
white house when congress goes into recess 
the senate however traditionally waives this rule by unanimous 
consent of its members when the white house pledges not to make 
recess appointments 
without such a promise the senate could send all 123 of bushs 
nominations now pending on capitol hill back to the white house and 
begin confirmation proceedings anew in september

a piedmont airlines jet dragged its left 
wing and engine down a runway during an emergency landing wednesday 
after part of its landing gear jammed but none of the 100 people 
aboard was injured 
ive had worse landings on regular flights said passenger 
tammy rudd 26 of washington dc 
the left landing gear could not be lowered because of a wheel 
chock that had lodged in the landing gear bay said national 
transportation safety board investigator phillip powell 
he said he did not know how or when the rubber chock which is 
used to hold planes in place on the ground might have been wedged 
there a piedmont spokesman said wheel chocks are supposed to be 
left on the ground 
abc news reported that investigators believe mechanics at 
washington national airport might have accidentally left the chock 
in the planes landing gear well 
passengers praised the crew and the pilot whom piedmont refused 
to identify 
it was kind of like a rollercoaster kind of fun said army 
sgt debbie mcdorman of washington dc she said the passengers 
were calm and the landing was just as smooth as if he was on 
wheels 
the boeing 737400 carried 94 passengers and six crew including 
the pilot said piedmont spokesman david shipley piedmont took 
delivery of the jetliner in december 1988 and has had no problems 
with it or with the 737400 fleet in general shipley said 
the plane was bound for charlotte from washington national 
airport but was diverted to greensboro where piedmont has a 
maintenance hangar after a cockpit light showed the landing gear 
wasnt locked shipley said 
the pilot circled for better than an hour in an attempt to get 
all the gear down said federal aviation administration spokesman 
roger myers the pilot got the nose wheel and right landing gear 
down but not the left gear myers said 
during maneuvers to shake loose the landing gear and use up 
fuel the jetliner did a touchandgo on one wheel contacting the 
runway before immediately taking off again 
finally the plane was eased down to the ground near the 
beginning of the 10000foot runway after the right main landing 
gear touched down the left wing tilted slowly toward the ground 
tapping it twice before the wing and its engine assembly dragged 
the runway 
emergency vehicles lined the runway after the airport was closed 
to other traffic 
there was a brief flash of flame and smoke apparently from a 
tire and the plane slid in a straight line coming to rest about a 
third of the way down the runway 
passengers slid down emergency chutes emergency crews sprayed 
foam on the wing and engine 
carolyn long said she was moved from her seat which was located 
on an emergency exit so that someone stronger could handle the door 
once the plane landed 
they had prepared us with this brace procedure mrs long 
said crossing her arms over her head to demonstrate the 
instructions i braced and braced 
some passengers were still shaking and soaked in sweat after 
they were bused to the terminal from the runway 
alfred roscoe also of washington dc had but one comment 
when he emerged from the plane thank god 
he said the pilot did a very beautiful job 
i went to the pilot when we got off and flashed him a 
thumbsup sign said passenger richard kochan 
kochan said the pilot looked at him then pointed to the sky 
i think the crew deserves a tremendous amount of praise 
said piedmont spokeswoman susan young it shows a tremendous 
amount of professionalism she said the pilot had flown 20 years 
for piedmont 
boeing which delivered the plane to piedmont on nov 14 1988 
will not send a crash investigation team said spokesman tom cole 
in seattle 
on saturday the piedmont name will disappear and all planes 
will bear usair markings piedmont and usair have been subsidiaries 
of usair group for two years

an arcadia fruit picker who spent more than 
21 years in prison for the 1967 poisoning deaths of his seven 
children is filing a 35 million lawsuit for being wrongly 
convicted his attorneys said wednesday 
james richardson was freed last april after a state 
investigation ordered by gov bob martinez found that suppressed 
evidence and perjured testimony was used to convict the 53yearold 
farm worker 
richardson stood trial only for the slaying of his oldest child 
and was sentenced to die in the electric chair the sentence was 
commuted to life in prison when the us supreme court struck down 
the death penalty in 1972 
attorneys in sarasota were to file richardsons suit thursday in 
us district court in tampa 
the lawsuit names the state of florida desoto county former 
state attorney frank schaub and former desoto sheriff frank cline 
the 22page complaint includes five separate counts of 
constitutional and civil rights violations and racketeering 
activities on the part of schaub and cline 
roger young one of richardsons attorneys conceded it was 
difficult placing a dollar amount on the time richardson spent in 
prison 
its hard you cant really do it young said he was 
without his family loss of liberty and everything thats 
guaranteed to him by the constitution those things were all 
stripped from him because of the actions of frank schaub 
the suit charges schaub and cline furthered a conspiracy to 
convict richardson at all costs 
they manufactured evidence witnesses were threatened and they 
knowingly used perjured testimony to convict richardson young 
said 
schaub who retired in january prosecuted the case in 1968 and 
blasted special prosecutor janet reno for concluding that 
richardson probably was wrongfully accused ms reno announced in 
may that the state would not retry richardson whose sentence was 
vacated april 25 
neither schaub nor cline were immediately available for comment 
the suit seeks to compensate richardson for mental anguish loss 
of the capacity for the enjoyment of life loss of income pain and 
suffering and loss of his liberty and rights as a citizen of the 
united states 
since his release from a state prison near daytona beach 
richardson has worked at a diet clinic run by former comedian dick 
gregory in fort walton beach richardson was expected to comment on 
the suit at a news conference scheduled for thursday in sarasota 
richardson was initially jailed on charges of poisoning his 
seven children to collect insurance money six of the children 
ages 2 to 8 died oct 25 1967 after eating a pesticidelaced 
lunch the seventh child died the next day 
richardson and his wife annie mae were out in the orange 
groves at the time 
the suit said schaub and cline continued to pursue the insurance 
motive even though the evidence showed that there had never been 
an insurance policy taken out 
cline also suppressed all evidence implicating bessie reese a 
baby sitter who served the fatal lunch to the children the suit 
charges in recent years ms reese confessed to the killings but 
that confession was thrown out because she was ruled mentally 
incompetent 
sheriff frank cline manipulated the evidence to exonerate a 
murderer and frank schaub conspired with him to do so from the 
beginning of the investigation and continues to do so to this 
day according to the suit 
ms reno the dade county state attorney appointed by the 
governor to investigate the allegations found evidence of trial 
errors and called the murder investigation totally inadequate and 
incomplete

an emotionally divided house on wednesday 
rejected an effort to tighten abortion restrictions in the district 
of columbia the first congressional test on the subject since a 
supreme court ruling last month permitting states to impose new 
limits 
on a surprising 219206 vote that evoked hugs and hoots of cheer 
on the house floor by supporters of the right to abortion the 
lawmakers rejected a proposal that would have banned all government 
spending on abortions in the capital 
the vote was a reversal of house sentiment last year when the 
legislators voted 222186 to ban public spending on the procedures 
abortion activists said it was the first time since 1980 the house 
had refused to restrict government spending for abortion 
the defeated provision an amendment to a spending bill for the 
fiscal year beginning oct 1 that forms washingtons municipal 
budget was proposed by rep robert dornan rcalif the 
prohibition would have included cases in which the mothers life is 
in danger or pregnancies resulting from rape or incest 
the house recessed for the day and left the vote on final 
passage of the overall bill for thursday that left antiabortion 
lawmakers one more chance to find votes and try to salvage their 
proposal perhaps by defeating the entire spending measure 
defeat of the amendment left intact abortion provisions in the 
bill which are more liberal than current law the bill would allow 
the district to spend its own funds for abortions and to use 
federal funds if the pregnancy was the result of rape or incest or 
if the mothers life was in danger current law which expires 
sept 30 contains a ban on spending either federal or district 
funds unless the mothers life is threatened 
quoting the hospitalized rep henry hyde rill one of the 
houses foremost abortion opponents dornan said this is not 
government intervention the governments first duty is to protect 
the weak from the strong 
dornan and his supporters said they preferred to include an 
exception for mothers whose lives are threatened but did not 
because it would have left their amendment vulnerable to being 
struck down for procedural reasons 
opponents to dornans language warned that the roll call would 
supply a hit list of lawmakers for voters who support the freedom 
to choose abortions 
all across the country a newly energized prochoice movement 
is going to say to supporters of amendments like this if you are 
antichoice when we the voters go to the ballot box we wont 
choose you rep les aucoin dore said before the vote 
jubilant prochoice lawmakers readily conceded that they had not 
expected to win but attributed the surprise victory to a new alarm 
among voters triggered by the supreme courts recent decision 
restricting womens constitutional right to abortion 
after the vote aucoin said it was clear to members that this 
is an issue on which theyre going to be held accountable this 
vote was a dramatic turn and it clearly reflects whats happening 
in the country its a sea change 
the courts decision was really a wakeup call to abortion 
defenders said rep pat schroeder dcolo house members must be 
starting to hear from people back home 
this is a barometer said rep barbara boxer dcalif the 
winds are blowing and theyre blowing in our direction 
dornan blamed his defeat on the new attention the supreme court 
ruling has brought to abortion the election of several freshmen 
who favor liberalized abortion laws and a reluctance by some 
lawmakers to vote for a measure containing no exception for 
endangered mothers 
he noted that earlier thursday the house had overwhelmingly 
approved a separate spending bill that barred the department of 
health and human services from providing any funds for abortions 
except for instances when the womans life is at stake 
im not worried about losing anything else he said 
eleanor smeal president of the fund for the feminist majority 
and a former president of the national organization for women was 
elated 
were on a roll thirtythree votes switched since 1980 
weve marched in the streets surged in the polls and challenged 
both parties ms smeal said 
on july 3 the supreme court gave states greater powers to 
restrict abortions allowing them to ban public employees or 
facilities from participating in abortions even when patients are 
willing to pay for them

the senate on wednesday approved a 295 
billion defense bill that leaves president bushs strategic 
programs such as star wars and the b2 bomber relatively intact 
but backs an aircraft bush sought to kill 
the basic goals of the president was met said sen john 
warner of virginia ranking republican on the senate armed services 
committee prior to final passage of the legislation 
by a vote of 954 the senate approved its version of the 
defense authorization bill for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 a 
blueprint that bears no resemblance to house legislation that 
gutted or severely cut the presidents bigticket weapons systems 
the senate bill endorses the presidents two mobilemissile 
plan including the request of 11 billion for the mx 
railgarrison and 100 million for the midgetman 
the legislation also makes a modest cut of 400 million in the 
49 billion request for star wars and trims 300 million from the 
47 billion proposal for the b2 stealth bomber 
the senate backed the costly bomber priced at 530 million a 
copy if it meets flight test and radarevasion standards and 
accepted bushs decision to cancel the f14d tomcat jet fighter 
but the chamber diverged from the president on the marine corps 
v22 osprey the tiltrotor assault transport that takes off like a 
helicopter but can fly like a plane the senate approved 255 
million in research and development for the bellboeing aircraft 
the house and senate meet in conference in early september to 
complete a final version of the two defense blueprints the chambers 
have crafted the final product will include 295 billion for the 
defense department plus 10 billion for the department of energy 
we have more profound differences this year than weve had in 
a long long time said sen sam nunn dga chairman of the 
senate armed services committee we face a difficult conference 
with the house on this bill 
the money still has to be dispersed through appropriations bills 
last week the house slashed 18 billion from the star wars 
request limited production of the b2 bomber to two planes next 
year and two the year after that half what the administration 
sought required the pentagon to come up with a program cheaper 
than 70 billion for the planned 132 planes and cut 502 million 
from the mx missile 
the house also eliminated all 100 million for the midgetman and 
restored the v22 osprey and the f14d jet fighter the two planes 
bush proposed canceling 
overwhelming senate approval of the bill was not without some 
dissent 
our motto ought to be in bombs we trust thats our national 
ethic that is the example we are setting here on this floor 
said sen mark hatfield the oregon republican who entered congress 
during the vietnam war and was one of the first serviceman on the 
scene after the atom bomb was dropped on hiroshima 
voting against were sens kent conrad dnd tom harkin 
diowa howard metzenbaum dohio and hatfield sen donald 
riegle dmich did not vote 
in other developments on the bill which kept lawmakers will

approved by voice vote a nonbinding resolution urging bush to 
continue development of the marine corps v22 osprey the 
tiltrotor aircraft the administration sought to cancel the 
defense bill includes 255 million for research and development of 
the bellboeing v22 which takes off like a helicopter but can fly 
like a plane 
by voice vote the senate approved an amendment by sen trent 
lott rmiss requiring graduates of the nations military 
academies to serve six years of service after graduation rather 
than the eight years the bill would have required the current 
requirement is five years lott argued that the eightyear 
requirement would drive applicants away from the academies 
the effort to table the amendment failed 5545 prior to the 
voice vote there is no comparable provision in the house version 
of the bill 
accepted by voice vote a nonbinding resolution instructing the 
cia and defense department to report by sept 1 on how best to 
locate and rescue american hostages in lebanon the report must 
detail how additional money and agents can be used to find the 
hostages and win their release 
voted 5344 against a plan to spend 100 million for the 
effective deployment of 100 groundbased interceptor missiles in 
grand forks nd by 1995 the interceptors part of the

the defense bill legislation contains 200 million for 
antisatellite weapons in addition to unspecified amounts in the 
star wars budget 
sens john kerry dmass and james jeffords rvt had 
proposed restrictions to bar such tests unless the administration 
could certify that the soviets had engaged in tests of their own 
had refused to bargain in good faith in limitations and had blocked 
international verification efforts 
the efforts to block attempts to chip away at bushs defense 
package were evident earlier this morning when the senate avoided a 
vote on an amendment transferring 450 million from the 
administrations 49 billion request for the star wars 
antimissile shield to the war on drugs 
instead the senate approved a compromise drafted by sen sam 
nunn dga chairman of the armed services committee that would 
shift unspent balances in federal programs left over at the end of 
the fiscal year ending sept 30 to the antidrug effort 
the measure exempts entitlement programs including social 
security medicare and subsidized housing but all other 
government programs and agencies including the defense department 
would be compelled to contribute 
the senate has sought to avoid following the house lead in 
gutting or severely cutting back bushs strategic programs last 
week the house voted to cut 18 billion from star wars impose 
strict limitations on the b2 stealth bomber slash 502 million 
from the 11 billion request for the mx nuclear missile and

the federal government is investigating 
allegations that the boeing co overcharged and doublebilled the 
department of defense millions of dollars for repairs of buildings 
leased for secret military work 
the investigation by two defense agencies a congressional 
panel and reportedly the department of justices criminal 
division was sparked by a boeing electrical engineer and 
inspector kevin g kelly who was fired friday 
but it has gone beyond his allegations said an investigator for 
a congressman looking into the case 
the investigation appears to have started with boeings lease of 
buildings under government contract from millionaire seattle 
developer david sabey according to an internal boeing memorandum 
obtained by the associated press 
the buildings were built to boeings specifications by sabey 
but kelly says three buildings at one office park were substandard 
and required 3 million in electrical and other repairs and 
improvements and that boeing billed the government for the work 
rather than sabey 
boeing spokesman paul binder confirmed tuesday that an 
investigation was underway and read a statement 
mr kelly noted some items that he concluded did not meet 
building and electrical codes the items he noted were thoroughly 
investigated by boeing and corrective actions were taken where 
appropriate additionally the buildings were inspected and 
approved by the appropriate local government agencies 
binder boeings director of public relations declined further 
comment on the investigation and kellys firing 
sabey was unavailable his secretary said sabey corp attorney 
don berdick said the firm would have no comment 
the leases with sabey include buildings at two office parks used 
by boeing advanced systems for military work the boeing division 
has defense contracts and subcontracts that range from work on the 
b2 stealth bomber to guided missile systems and avionic research 
kelly contends he was fired for alerting federal officials to 
boeing billing the defense department for the repairs at the oxbow 
office park 
he says boeing ignored his early warnings that electrical work 
in the buildings was substandard in a july 18 letter to boeing 
chief executive officer frank shrontz kelly contended he was 
effectively quieted by boeing management and i have not been 
able to intelligently and satisfactorily discuss with supervisors 
the substandard workmanship 
shrontzs secretary said her boss would not comment 
people in management have been covering up kelly asserted 
tuesday not one man in that whole group had the courage to stand 
up and tell sabey the buildings were substandard instead they 
said let the taxpayer pay for it 
kelly said he has given investigators stacks of records over the 
past year some copies of which he gave to the ap when he learned 
he was to be fired including blueprints and other documents he 
contended reveal substandard electrical work that clearly 
violated not only boeings specifications of what they wanted in 
the oxbow buildings but national and state electrical and building 
codes 
the internal memo from boeing attorney sw barclay to 
department heads describes the scope of a recent defense 
department subpoena of company records most of the materials 
subpoenaed ranging from leasehold improvements repair and 
maintenance to internal company audits of leases refer 
specifically to the sabey corp barclay admonished officials to 
destroy nothing that might relate to the subpoena 
investigations by the air force office of special investigations 
and the defense contract audit agency began in mid1988 with 
allegations from kelly 
kelly said the justice department also is investigating 
although assistant us attorney bruce carter of seattle declined 
to confirm that as a matter of policy 
an investigator for rep john dingell dmich said dingells 
energy and commerce committee also is looking into kellys 
allegations the staffer speaking on condition of anonymity also 
said the justice department is investigating 
air force sgt michael grinnell spokesman in washington for the 
air force investigations office said i can confirm that we do 
have an ongoing investigation concerning mischarging of facility 
repair costs for leased buildings by mischarging we mean 
overcharging doublebilling 
kelly said that when boeing went to repair some of the problems 
it had to fix some of them a second or third time im told by 
the afosi that the taxpayers pay for all of these repairs not 
sabey 
grinnell and philip e rogers a spokesman in washington for the 
defense contract audit agency both declined to discuss kellys 
specific allegations or other elements of their investigations 
but dingells staff investigator said from our standpoint 
the dcaa and the osi appear to be making substantial progress from 
what theyve told us kellys allegations all appear to have 
merit 
the agencies and the justice department he said are looking 
at mischarging overcharging doublebilling 
and he said that while kelly was the catalyst for the 
investigation it has gone beyond his allegations 
kelly said he plans to sue under a federal statute that provides 
whistleblowers a portion of settlements if the allegations are 
proved

the israeli supreme court ruled wednesday that 
the army can destroy the homes of palestinians suspected of 
antiisraeli activities even if they are rented 
the decision followed by just four days a supreme court ruling 
that said the army must give palestinians an opportunity to appeal 
before destroying their homes 
in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 13 palestinians were 
shot and wounded in stonethrowing clashes with troops hospitals 
reported 
a palestinian prisoner jihad abdel imadi was seriously beaten 
by fellow inmates at israelis ketziot detention center in the 
southern negev desert the army said it said it was investigating 
the circumstances of the incident 
the supreme court ruling came in response to a case brought by 
an arab landlord in the west bank town of tulkarem the independent 
itim news agency reported 
the landlord ahmed khalil jumail said he rented an apartment 
to mustafa omar who has been charged with throwing molotov 
cocktails at an army vehicle and at the house of a palestinian 
suspected of collaborating with israel 
jumail said that even though he had no connection with omars 
alleged activities the defense ministry had ordered his property 
destroyed 
meir shamgar the court president ruled that if sanctions could 
not be taken against rental property it would negate all the 
deterrent power that comes from the usage of the emergency defense 
regulations itim said 
he said however that jumails property should be sealed and 
not destroyed 
israeli forces have blown up or torn down at least 225 houses in 
the occupied territories since the start of the palestinian 
uprising against israeli rule 19 months ago at least 527 
palestinians and 38 israelis have died in the uprising 
the united states and international human rights groups have 
called for an end to the practice saying that it is carried out 
without due process of the law in many cases property is 
destroyed before the suspect is either charged or tried

pink scallops contaminated with a 
potentially deadly natural poison were shipped to restaurants 
because of the time it took to process tests on the shellfish 
officials said wednesday 
shellfish tested contained more than five times the level of the 
poison permitted by state regulations said state health department 
spokesman scott lewis 
all but 7 pounds of the 75 pounds of scallops in the shipment 
from washington state had been accounted for by late wednesday 
according to state health officials 
officials were trying to determine whether diners had eaten any 
of the scallops said ken august another health department 
spokesman august said there had been no reports of poisonings and 
noted that the poison is relatively fastacting 
the distributor marinellis seafood co recovered 35 pounds of 
the shipment and advised four san franciscoarea restaurants that 
received a total of 25 pounds to destroy the scallops said 
marinellis general manager mike mitchell 
an additional 15 pounds were sent to a new york restaurateur 
who also was told to destroy the shellfish mitchell said 
another 75pound shipment of scallops gathered from the same 
area but at a different time was shipped to los angeles but was 
found to be uncontaminated health officials said 
all commercial shellfishing in northern puget sound was 
suspended until washington state can analyze the situation said 
jack lilja shellfish program manager for that states health 
department 
the pink scallop is a gourmet item typically sold only to 
restaurants although some markets occasionally carry it lewis 
said 
health investigators identified the poison as saxitoxin a 
natural substance that does not harm shellfish but causes paralysis 
and sometimes death in humans 
the shipment from rock point oysters inc of bow wash arrived 
and was tested at san francisco international airport on monday 
washington health inspectors routinely test scallops every two 
weeks but apparently this particular lot slipped through said 
lilja 
it takes 24 hours to process the california tests and the 
scallops were transferred to marinellis pending the results lewis 
said by the time the contamination was reported late tuesday 
afternoon they had already been shipped 
youre dealing with a live product said lewis there are 
economic factors at work too 
frank nava chief of field operations for the food and drug 
branch of the california health department could not say why 
incoming shellfish are not held during the 24hour processing 
period 
i dont have an answer for that except that 99 percent of the 
time theyre ok theyre great nava said it works fine 
officials must balance public health considerations with the 
danger of causing unnecessary panic he said 
california officials are reviewing their testing policies and 
are waiting to see if washington authorities change their 
procedures nava said 
saxitoxin is a potent poison that can cause paralysis and even 
death according to the california health department it is picked 
up by shellfish feeding on a red tide made up of microorganisms 
cooking will not destroy the toxin and concentrations of about 
1000 micrograms per 3ounce serving have caused serious problems 
for people according to olga woo a specialist with the poison 
control center at the university of california san francisco 
the sample gathered monday contained the equivalent of about 470 
micrograms per 3 ounces woo said 
bill marinelli of marinellis seafood disputed the warning that 
the shellfish could be deadly the toxin levels were not safe 
but by no means lethal he said

diesel fuel spilled into whitefish lake 
by a train derailment began washing up on beaches and shores near 
this resort community wednesday and residents complained that the 
cleanup effort was halfhearted 
gov stan stephens toured the site by helicopter and said 
burlington northern railroad would be held accountable for 
anything thats been adversely impacted that has a cost to it 
as well as all cleanup costs 
bn vice president bill francis said the railroad would pay all 
costs legally that we need to 
bn continued to pump diesel oil remaining in tanker cars that 
landed in the lake but said all leaks had been plugged by divers 
and no more oil was spilling the railroad estimated 10000 gallons 
had spilled since mondays derailment 
twentynine cars of a 100car train derailed monday four miles 
north of whitefish in northwestern montana and several cars 
including the fuelcarrying tankers went down a 100foot 
embankment into whitefish lake no injuries were reported 
francis estimated the cost of the derailment alone at 557000 
but said he has no estimate on cleanup costs 
a helicopter survey wednesday revealed that about half the 
3350acre lake was covered with the telltale rainbow sheen of a 
thin oil slick and oil began washing ashore on the populated 
southern and eastern banks 
its awful said dean olafson who lives on the eastern 
shore weve been mopping all morning and the winds changed and 
now its just come back in again 
olafson complained that there had been too little response to 
the spill 
the way they react is just wrong olafson said theyre 
always looking for the cheap way out and it ends up being more 
expensive 
the governor said he was deeply saddened by the sight 
noting he and his family have vacationed at the lake for years 
the tank cars should be pulled out of the water sometime 
thursday said gus melonas bns montana spokesman 
the derailment closed bns main line from minneapolis to 
seattle forcing freight trains to be rerouted south and amtrak 
had to bus passengers from its empire builder train around the 
derailment area

a congressman wednesday questioned how the 
state department issues travel advisories saying a warning should 
have been posted for kenya before a connecticut woman became the 
latest tourist killed in a recent string of ambushes 
while the state department did respond the following day by 
placing kenya on the travel advisory list i must seriously 
question why this action was not taken earlier rep john g 
rowland rconn said in a letter to secretary of state james a 
baker iii 
three german tourists were wounded in an ambush in april two 
french tourists were killed by ivory poachers in early july and two 
americans were beaten while riding horseback last week rowland 
said 
it is my understanding that incidents such as the above weigh 
heaviest in any decision to place a nation on the travel advisory 
list the congressman said american citizens deserve to be 
informed of any dangers they face as international travelers 
an advisory for kenya was not issued until after marie ferraro 
50 of bethany conn was shot to death last thursday by two 
bandits armed with assault rifles who fired at a van carrying a 
connecticut audubon society wildlife tour group 
my saddness and concern stem from this tragic loss of life and 
the possibility that proper risk notification was not given 
rowland said 
the congressman requested a detailed explanation of the 
decisionmaking process for travel advisories and urged an 
indepth review by the department of its procedures 
a spokeswoman for the state departments bureau of consular 
affairs referred to a march press release that read in part 
travel advisories which describe a potential for violence and 
physical danger usually reflect a trend or pattern of violence over 
a period of time in which the government of the country involved is 
unwilling or unable to afford normal protection

a chinese student who helped stage a 
demonstration at beijing university last month has been expelled 
and refused his diploma university officials said 
a public announcement posted on bulletin boards once festooned 
with the posters of the studentled prodemocracy movement said 
xiong dayong 22 had broken martial law regulations banning 
unauthorized gatherings 
the notice dated july 25 said xiong a fourthyear student of 
chinese and a member of the communist partys youth league had 
incited other students to cause trouble by breaking martial law 
restrictions 
it also accused xiong of being a known criminal who had 
stolen three bicycles this summer and caused a drunken brawl last 
year 
with no diploma and an expulsion on his record xiong will have 
difficulty finding work 
on july 23 from 300 to 400 students sang and beat pots and pans 
to mourn classmates killed june 34 when troops opened fire on 
student protesters and supporters 
china has said 200300 people died in the military assault but 
chinese witnesses and western intelligence sources said the death 
toll may have been as high as 3000 
the students said they held the july 23 demonstration because 
they felt oppressed by the ideological study classes they were 
forced to attend following the military crackdown they were also 
protesting because some of them were refused permission to join the 
work units to which they were earlier assigned 
most college graduates in china are assigned jobs by the 
government most of the 32000 graduates from 80 universities and 
colleges in beijing this year have been accepted by their assigned 
units the official xinhua news agency reported wednesday 
the report said more than 1000 graduates however had not 
found appropriate jobs in part because some foreign companies 
party schools judicial departments travel agencies and the 
military had dropped plans to accept more than 300 students 
the report did not say whether the refusals were due to 
political considerations arising from participation in the 
prodemocracy demonstrations this spring which were initiated and 
led by students from beijing universities 
it quoted han xueping head of the student department of the 
beijing higher education bureau as saying that all graduates in 
beijing had undergone three weeks of political study to review 
their thought and actions during the student protests

government investigators told congress on 
wednesday they have uncovered an additional 12 million in 
payments to wellconnected consultants who helped their employers 
win big hud contracts on housing for the poor 
paul adams inspector general at the department of housing and 
urban development said known consultant fees now total more than 
57 million for a single housing rehabilitation program he said 
about onefifth of all lowincome apartment rehabilitations were 
snared by companies employing 20 consultants 
the consultants include politically influential republicans and 
former agency officials 
a senate panel heard the testimony as a house subcommittee voted 
60 to subpoena lance wilson to testify in september wilson a 
former executive assistant to thenhud secretary samuel pierce 
failed to appear voluntarily last week to discuss allegations of 
abuse and mismanagement at the agency saying his attorney was ill 
meanwhile the hud scandal spilled over onto the senate floor 
majority leader george mitchell said the agency had been used 
as a political slush fund where political appointees gave favors 
to politically wellconnected individuals during the reagan 
administration 
republican leader bob dole countered that the democratic 
majority was stalling efforts by hud secretary jack kemp to clean 
up the department by delaying confirmation votes on several key 
appointees 
lets make certain we understand that congress hasnt been 
very cooperative dole said now weve got a situation where 
secretary jack kemp is trying to do the right thing and he 
doesnt have anybody on board 
the senate banking committee voted 170 wednesday to recommend 
approval of the nomination of c austin fitts as assistant 
secretary of housing and it was approved by unanimous consent by 
the full senate late wednesday 
adams report to the banking committee included several familiar 
names of consultants who received large fees 
they included joseph strauss a former hud official who received 
nearly 17 million in fees former interior secretary james watt 
who received 300000 former hud secretary and current us trade 
representative carla hills who received 138445 and philip 
abrams a former agency undersecretary who got 100000 
sen bob graham dfla said in some of the earlier hearings 
we identified the rats now were starting to identify the cheese 
that attracted these rats 
much of the profit that developers made from hud programs were 
derived from tax credits and rent subsidies for apartments in areas 
where housing demand was weakening 
the profits were used to pay millions of dollars in consultant 
fees on projects in a handful of states that shouldnt have gotten 
such projects because they had weak or very weak rental 
markets according to adams and other analysts 
multiple benefits were awarded to eligible projects by 
different administering agencies such as hud state tax credit 
allocation agencies and local governments said john m ols jr 
director of housing and community development issues of the general 
accounting office the investigative arm of congress 
the gao found developers received between 250000 and 21 
million above their purchase and renovation costs in its review of 
eight projects in huds troubled moderate rehabilitation programs 
he said 
this is the profit of the developer less any income taxes he 
would have to pay said ols 
ols said excessive government rent subsidies for those projects 
could amount to 25 million over the 15year period of the hud 
rental subsidy contracts 
in an update of his april audit of the moderate rehabilitation 
program hud inspector general adams told the panel 20 consultants 
were paid more than 57 million for lobbying for 51 projects 
those projects covered 7268 rental units or 203 percent of 
the moderate rehabilitation funding available since 1983 adams 
said 
in addition adams found many of the projects concentrated in 
four states colorado oklahoma nevada and wyoming which 
received more funds than they would have if they had been 
distributed using the fair share formula that congress had 
waived 
the bottom line is that the mod rehab program probably was not 
needed in these states during that time period said adams 
the rental markets at the time these projects were approved were 
either weak or very weak said morton j schussheim a housing 
specialist with the congressional research service 
schussheim examined 20 projects funded by the mod rehab program 
whose mortgages were originated by the knoxville tennbased 
benton mortgage co under the federal coinsured mortgage program 
schussheim told the committee he could not determine if 
developers sought situations where properties could be bought at 
comparatively low prices because the market was soft but said 
it was a plausible hypothesis 
ols said the soft markets provided developers opportunity to 
convert available future tax credits on the projects to ready cash 
by selling to investors through syndicators

annexation of their homeland in a secret pact between josef stalin 
and adolf hitler an activist said

the soviet government declare the august 1939 pact to be null 
a moscow legislative commission is thought to be within days of 
declaring void the agreement that divided eastern europe before 
world war ii into soviet and german spheres of influence the 
kremlin had denied for years that any such pact existed 
activists in the baltic republics of lithuania latvia and 
estonia have pushed for such a decision for more than two years 
rozhgo said moldavia also came under soviet control because of the 
pact

the senate passed a disaster assistance bill 
wednesday to send 885 million in relief to farmers hit by drought 
and severe weather 
the bill would make farmers eligible for federal aid if they 
have crop losses this year because of drought flooding freezing 
hail high winds or similar severe weather the measure also 
provides for payments to livestock producers facing droughtrelated 
feed and water shortages for their herds 
but the pricetag on the bill passed by voice vote in the senate 
is about 463 million less than the agriculture department has 
estimated would be the cost of a packaged approved by the house 
the senate bill provides for different eligibility standards for 
various crops but in all cases producers would receive payments 
designed to cover 65 percent of their lost income from crop losses 
in most cases the projected income levels will be based on 
federal crop subsidies or average market prices farmers would have 
received had they not suffered losses 
the most important thing about this bill is that all farmers 
are being treated fairly said sen patrick leahy dvt 
chairman of the agriculture committee those who suffer a 
significant loss will receive the same payment rate 65 percent of 
the applicable target price or loan rate 
we will not discriminate against any farmer who needs help 
leahy said this legislation treats farmers fairly whether they 
grow wheat corn hay or soybeans 
wheat and other crops have been damaged by the lingering drought 
across much of the great plains and flooding has destroyed rice and 
cotton in the south 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan said winter wheat 
producers and other growers will be eligible for highpriority 
attention under provisions of the legislation 
this is not the best bill nor is it the kind of relief winter 
wheat producers and other program crops deserve he said but 
it is far better than the budgetbusting house bill which promised 
federal relief to every crop in america 
the house disaster relief bill required a minimum loss of 35 
percent for any crop to receive assistance with payments covering 
65 percent of lost income but unlike the senate bill the house 
measure called for 90 percent payments on crop losses of more than 
75 percent 
the senate dropped the higher payment level as a way of cutting 
the overall cost of the assistance package 
the senate also passed by voice vote rural development 
legislation designed to promote business investment and expansion 
in small towns it also is aimed at improving schools and health 
care for residents 
proponents had said federal assistance was needed because the 61 
million people living in rural areas face higher unemployment more 
hospital closings and higher poverty levels than their urban 
counterparts the rural economy also is more volatile because of 
its dependence on natural resources supporters contended 
the centerpiece of the package called the rural partnership 
act is a revolving loan fund program to provide 300 million in 
seed money over five years for new and expanding businesses 
the federal money which must be matched by money from local 
sources would go for loans and loan guarantees to create new jobs 
the revolving loan funds would be operated by states local 
governor or economic development groupst to ensure local control of 
the lending according to supportrs

a study paid for by oil interests concluded 
wednesday that natural gas heat might contribute more to the 
greenhouse effect warming of the earth than oil heat the gas 
industry immediately attacked the report as flawed and biased 
the new england fuel institute an oil industry group based in 
watertown mass commissioned university of minnesota professor 
dean e abrahamson to compare the two fuels 
abrahamson a physicist is a public policy professor at the 
universitys humbert h humphrey institute of public affairs and 
cochairman of the schools council of environmental quality he 
edited and was a coauthor of the challenge of global warming 
a book sponsored by the natural resources defense council an 
environmental group he serves on the councils board of trustees 
ted kinne vice president at the interstate natural gas 
association of america an industry group representing pipeline 
companies said the study is clearly biased towards oil it is 
obvious who is paying for this study 
abrahamson at a news conference sponsored by the new england 
fuel institute defended the independence of his study 
the oil task force put absolute no constraints on the study 
he said 
scientists believe several gases allow warmth from the sun to 
pass through to the earths surface but block outgoing radiation 
raising the planets temperature in the same way a greenhouse stays 
warm 
the chief contributor accounting for about half the predicted 
future warming is carbon dioxide an inevitable product of 
combustion of any carboncontaining fuel 
methane is another such gas and natural gas is almost all 
methane 
for equivalent heat output it has long been known that oil 
produces about 40 percent more carbon dioxide than natural gas 
the study said global warming from natural gas heat would exceed 
the global heating from oil heat if 1 percent to 2 percent of the 
natural gas is lost 
abrahamson said he found that 013 percent of the gas is lost in 
production and 054 percent is reported unaccounted for in 
interstate transmission distribution companies report 1 percent to 
6 percent unaccounted for and that does not count any that 
escapes after passing through the customers meter 
but the american gas association said the unaccounted for gas in 
all utilities includes gas theft meter inaccuracies and other 
factors in addition to leaks 
the gas association estimated that about 04 percent of the gas 
is lost in leaks 
abrahamson said methane causes 30 to 70 times more greenhouse 
heating than the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide while gas 
industry representatives said it caused only 10 percent to 30 
percent as much 
the interstate natural gas association criticized the study for 
not taking into account the length of time the two gases will stay 
in the atmosphere methane remains in the air for 10 years while 
carbon dioxide remains for 500 years kinne said 
he assumes it is not worth considering i think the effect is 
very signficiant kinne said 
dennis tirpak an environmental protection agency official who 
has conducted studies of the greenhouse effect for the agency said 
methane was 20 times more effective molecule for molecule in 
trapping radiation than was carbon dioxide but its lifetime in the 
atmosphere is also important eight to 11 years vs 100 to 500 
years 
as to gas being a bigger contributor than oil if 1 per cent to 2 
percent is lost tirpak said i think youd have to go higher 
than than but i cant really say without having studied their 
statements 
methane concentrations in the atmosphere are increasing at about 
1 percent per year and no one has determined why though there are 
several theories some studies suggest that methane could be 
responsible for 20 percent of recent greenhouse warming if there 
has been any vs about 50 percent for carbon dioxide

the man accused of killing my sister 
sam star rebecca schaeffer was once thrown out of the tv studio 
where she was working after a guard noticed something haywire 
about him the guard said 
robert john bardo 19 came to the studio lot two years ago with 
a teddy bear and a bouquet and begged to see the actress said 
john egger chief of security for the burbank studios 
egger said he took bardo off the lot and drove him to the 
rundown motel in hollywood where the youth was staying he said 
bardo promised to return home to tucson ariz and that bardo 
called him the next day to say he was about to board a bus going 
there 
i thought he was just lovesick which i think he was egger 
62 said this week he was terribly insistent on being let in 
rebecca schaeffer was every other word i gotta see her i love 
her if i could just see her for a minute 
he seemed to be an intelligent kid no raving lunatic no 
dumbbell but something was definitely wrong mentally egger 
said there was something haywire going on but i didnt perceive 
it as potentially violent 
egger said bardo initially made numerous phone calls to the 
production office asking to speak to miss schaeffer 
the incident provided another glimpse into what authorities call 
bardos fatal obsession with the 21yearold actress who was shot 
july 18 as she opened the door to her apartment building bardo was 
arrested in tucson the next day and charged in the slaying 
egger a former beverly hills police captain said he followed 
standard procedure in informing miss schaeffers production unit 
about bardos attempt to see her in june 1987 but whether anyone 
told miss schaeffer remained unclear wednesday 
so a fan tried to get on the lot so what whos going to 
think hes a potential murderer asked mimi weber vice president 
of the production company for my sister sam 
it would have seemed harmless another young kid whos 
starstruck she said we have tons of those lots are lovable 
some are crazy but whos to know 
people who were present remember hearing about a persistent fan 
trying to gain access to the set but were unsure whether miss 
schaeffer was told 
the young actress already had received seemingly innocuous fan 
letters from bardo

a federal grand jury wednesday indicted 46 
traders at the worlds two largest commodity exchanges on charges 
ranging from tax fraud to racketeering for allegedly bilking 
profits from hundreds of customers 
the 2year federal investigation at the chicago board of trade 
and the chicago mercantile exchange resulted in allegations that 
traders systematically conspired with one another to skim profits 
from customers accounts and often tried to hide the profits from 
the internal revenue service 
sixteen of the traders were charged with violating the federal 
racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act which empowers 
the government to freeze defendants assets before a trial for 
seizure upon conviction 
the government increasingly has been using the law enacted to 
fight organized crime such as drug trafficking to crack down on 
securities crime and other whitecollar corruption 
us attorney general richard thornburgh who attended the news 
conference at which the indictments were announced said the 
charges were part of a crackdown on whitecollar crime in all its 
various guises from wall street to lasalle street to main street 
and all stops in between 
lasalle street is the heart of chicagos financial district 
the activity uncovered at these exchanges the largest of 
their type in the world cannot be tolerated thornburgh said 
us attorney anton valukas said traders broke the law and the 
rules governing business at the exchange by arranging deals with 
one another before and after the pits were open for trading 
he said the alleged activity involved hundreds of customers and 
thousands of trades no dollar amount was given for the alleged 
fraud but valukas said it was significant 
officials said the investigation was continuing and indicated 
more indictments were possible 
the charges contained in four indictments totaling 375 pages 
included hundreds of counts against the 46 people named 
nineteen indictments were returned for activities in the soybean 
pits and three in the us treasury bond pits at the board of 
trade at the chicago mercantile exchange 21 indictments were in 
the japanese yen pits and three each in swiss franc pits 
the government said directors of the board of trade and the 
mercantile exchange were not involved in the illegal activity and 
had cooperated in the investigation 
the legitimate activities of these exchanges involving 
everything from grains to government bonds and foreign currencies 
impact upon farmers consumers businesses and governments said 
thornburgh who was joined by valukas fbi director william 
sessions and wendy gramm head of the commodity futures trading 
commission at the news conference 
i want to assure all parties that public confidence in the 
honest functioning of the marketplace will be vigorously 
protected thornburgh added 
sessions said the fbi used extraordinary means to detect 
extraordinary fraud training agents in the complicated world of 
futures trading and sending them onto the exchange floors to mingle 
with real traders 
valukas said the illegal schemes involved prearranged trades at 
prices below what the traders customers actually paid for a 
commodity the traders involved would then share the illegal 
profit he said 
at the close of business traders frequently agreed among 
themselves to change prices on their cards to increase their 
profits and correct bad deals the prosecutor said 
valukas cited specific instances during the summer of 1988 
when soybean prices were rising rapidly because of the drought 
where brokers routinely withheld orders from the market and then 
gave them to favored traders cheating the customer out of a fair 
market price 
what we are talking about here are hundreds of customers 
involving thousands of trades for which fraud was perpetrated and 
losses incurred by those customers because of this scheme 
valukas said 
the fbi investigation disclosed in january also centered on 
allegations that brokers sent false reports to customers to hide 
the skimming of profits or overcharges on commissions 
the mercantile exchange also reportedly is planning to bring its 
own charges against four traders in connection with yenpit trades 
with one of the undercover fbi agent who posed as traders in the 
federal investigation 
traders have been bargaining with authorities and the exchanges 
to reduce the possible penalties against them 
futures are contracts to buy or sell by a future date at a 
specified price commodities and financial instruments ranging from 
soybeans and pork bellies to treasury bonds and baskets of stocks 
futures traders can make and lose fortunes within minutes while 
standing shouldertoshoulder in the pits and trading with each 
other 
independent traders called locals trade for their own 
accounts other traders called brokers trade on behalf of clients 
of futures brokerages some brokers also trade for their own 
accounts in an oftencriticized practice called dual trading 
the government won a key battle clearing the way for the 
indictments on friday when chief us district judge john grady 
denied a swiss franc traders contention that the governments 
secret taping of traders on the exchange floors had violated 
federal electronic surveillance laws

a federal court jury wednesday awarded 50 
million to the families of 137 passengers killed when a korean air 
lines plane strayed into soviet territory and was shot down six 
years ago 
all 269 people aboard were killed in the sept 1 1983 disaster 
the jury of three men and three women decided on punitive 
damages two hours after returning a verdict that kal had committed 
willful misconduct 
the jury concluded that actions by kals crew aboard flight 007 
were a cause of the aircrafts destruction by a missilefiring 
soviet fighter plane 
several family members clapped their hands when the finding of 
willful misconduct was announced and one woman in the front row 
wept 
the 50 million punitive damages if upheld will be shared 
equally by the 137 families about twothirds of the families who 
sued are american the rest various other nationalities families 
of victims who did not sue get no share 
without the finding of willful misconduct the families would 
have been limited to compensation of 75000 per passenger a 
figure set by international treaty 
with the finding the families are free to seek individual 
damages for such things as lost earnings of a parent or spouse in 
individual lawsuits in federal courts around the country 
one hundred thirtyseven such lawsuits were consolidated into 
one case in washington the case decided wednesday to determine 
only whether misconduct occured and whether punitive damages should 
be awarded 
george tompkins a lawyer defending the airline said the 
company will appeal wednesdays verdict 
in a twoweek civil trial lawyers for families of the victims 
said the boeing 747 was off course almost from the minute it left 
the ground in anchorage alaska and headed out over the pacific 
ocean for seoul south korea 
wreckage from the disaster was found in the sea of japan 
hundreds of miles from the planes scheduled flight path over the 
pacific ocean 
two veteran pilots testifying as expert witnesses for the 
families theorized that the plane crew made a mistake in 
programming at least one of the computerized navigation systems on 
board the jumbo jet while the aircraft was waiting to take off 
the error said the two experts sent the plane far west of its 
planned pacific ocean flight path and into soviet territory where 
it was stalked by soviet military jets 
other witnesses suggested the crew members knew they were off 
course but failed to return to anchorage alaska and correct the 
navigational problem for fear of disciplinary action and loss of 
respect from their colleagues 
lawyers representing kal rejected those contentions saying the 
crew radioed a position report that put it directly on course about 
an hour before it was shot down 
lawyers for the families suggested the crew was giving false 
position reports 
i think as a matter of law willful misconduct was not shown by 
the evidence said tompkins 
a defense motion to dismiss the case is pending before the judge 
the jurys verdict was in accord with all the evidence said 
donald madole a lawyer for the families when this plane was 
flown off course into the danger area it was in fact willful 
misconduct 
we think justice was done said milton sincoff another 
lawyer representing the families 
the downing of flight 007 was an unnecessary tragedy and many 
unanswered questions still remain a group representing some 
families said in a statement after the verdict we call on the 
soviet government to address the kal 007 shootdown by helping the 
victims including visitation rights to sakhalin island over 
which the plane was attacked 
the families want clarification of what happened to the 
remains of our loved ones said the statement by the american 
association for families of kal 007 victims 
eightyone of the victims were south korean 61 american 28 
japanese and the rest were other nationalities 
at the start of the trial us district court judge aubrey 
robinson suggested that both the soviet and us governments know 
far more about the tragedy than has been revealed to date but that 
for national security reasons werent disclosing it 
there are people who know exactly where this plane was shot 
down and how it got there i am willing to bet my bottom dollar 
on it said robinson i know what the capabilities are in this 
world certainly as between the soviet union and the us 
but robinson said all that is beyond our ken and nobody will 
breathe a word about it

tuesday night and at least one soldier and a civilian were killed 
in the fighting 
another soldier and two civilians were wounded in the battle 
that lasted two hours and kept many of the residents of the citys 
northwestern sector inside buildings or huddled behind walls or 
vehicles gunsmoke settled over the san ramon neighborhood where 
the fighting was heaviest 
it was the fifth time in eight months that the army post in san 
ramon has been attacked an estimated 200 rebels are based on the 
volcano and its foothills nearly reach san salvadors city limits 
sgt ventura lopez who was in command of the detachment of 10 
soldiers at the post estimated the number of attackers at 60 he 
said the guerrillas threw packets of tnt at the post one explosion 
ripped a hole in the roof of the singlestory cinderblock building 
that serves as post headquarters 
nearly 100 soldiers from the belloso army brigade reinforced the 
posts unit about 20 minutes after the fighting began at dusk 
thousands of rounds from assault rifles and machine guns and 
sporadic detonations of rocketpropelled grenades and tnt bombs 
kept residents pinned down

eight chinese performers have been missing 
for a week since they left a group returning to china but 
immigration officials said tuesday no one had contacted them on 
behalf of the entertainers 
all i can tell you is they havent walked into this office and 
applied for any relief said david ilchert a spokesman for the 
immigration and naturalization service 
four other chinese citizens have chosen to defect in san 
francisco since the june 4 crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators 
in beijing 
if the eight entertainers who fled the kun opera company last 
week seek political asylum in the united states it would be the 
largest single defection of chinese citizens since the 1950s 
everybody in china wants to leave so whoever has a chance to 
go out of china they will try to stay there said jeffrey shia 
president of the kiangsu chekiang association a nonprofit 
association that helps chinese immigrants 
the performers left the 28member opera over a twoday period 
last week while the company was in san francisco en route to 
shanghai following a series of performances in the united states 
we have had zero contact with them or with the consulate 
said fbi spokesman chuck latting we would like to talk to them 
we always want any defector to know that we are a wonderful 
umbrella for them we can help them get to us or any other agency 
the opera company flew back to shanghai on thursday according 
to officer larry higgins coordinator of vip travel at san 
francisco international airport 
a spokesman for the chinese consulate confirmed the eight 
performers did not leave with the company 
they were influenced by people with ulterior motives said 
spokesman wang shaohua 
officals of the chinese consulate in san francisco have blamed 
the disappearance on people with motives to bring damage to 
china 
the missing entertainers include hua wenyi a famous opera 
singer in shanghai two other singers in the group chen tongshen 
and zhan pingping also are well known in shanghai zhan is a 
famous television and film star as well as an opera performer the 
others were identified as qui huan chen chiping ma xinbao 
peter chong and lou seilong 
i think at this moment they fear making a wrong move whether 
they should seek political asylum or use other reasons to remain 
here said shia 
i think they are going to wait until this incident is cooled 
off and then decide what options they should take he said 
although accounts of the disappearances differ shia who spoke 
with several opera members last wednesday gave this description 
two members left during a farewell dinner on july 25 two others 
left that evening three group leaders early the next day 
wednesday and one performer left wednesday morning 
jon wu an attorney who specializes in immigration and who has 
represented defectors said the performers have numerous legal 
options 
because they arrived in san francisco june 5 they are eligible 
for the emergency deferred departure status announced by the 
bush administration in june the policy offers a oneyear blanket 
visa extension to all chinese citizens who were in the country on 
or before june 5 
alternatively political asylum is tough for people to get who 
havent really expressed any opinions against the chinese 
government wu said 
shia said if the performers were involved in the prodemocracy 
movement in china they would not have been allowed to leave 
other options to remain in the united states include permanent 
labor certification temporary work authorization or permanent 
residency if a relative successfully petitions on behalf of a 
chinese citizen

twenty consultants earned more than 57 
million by helping funnel much of the money in a federal housing 
program to developers in a handful of states that didnt need it 
says a report to a senate committee 
most of the 20 consultants were former housing and urban 
development employees or wellconnected republicans said a report 
by hud inspector general paul adams the consultants were paid by 
developers to help them get about onefifth of the money from a hud 
program to repair housing for the poor 
adams has reported before on the use of consultants in obtaining 
funds from hud but the new report is the first attempt to 
determine the extent and expense of the practice 
under the hud program developers were eligible for tax credits 
and could get hud to subsidize the rent of tenants who otherwise 
couldnt afford it 
in all 51 projects with a total of 7268 apartments funded 
since october 1983 used consultants adams report found that 
accounts for about 20 percent of all huds work in this area during

arguing with a big neighbor can be 
costly as nepal is discovering four months after losing the first 
round of a trade dispute with india 
already one of the worlds poorest countries landlocked and 
mountainous nepal faces difficult times unless it can come to terms 
with india on transporting its exports and imports across india at 
previously favored rates 
as a result of the dispute nepals deficit budget proposed for 
the fiscal year that started july 1 calls for expenditures to rise 
by 32 percent compared to 8 percent the previous fiscal year 
gasoline prices have been raised by 48 percent that reflects a 
threefold vulnerability of the nepalese economy steeper transit 
costs across india the declining value of the nepalese rupee and 
fluctuating crude oil prices in the middle east 
nepalese optimists say the trade and transit crisis with india 
will force nepal to develop its own infrastructure and become less 
reliant on others largesse 
pessimists say any such period of adjustment will take several 
years and further sap the resources of the country 
although the nepaleseindian dispute was sparked by treaty terms 
on bilateral trade and nepals access to indian transit facilities 
for thirdcountry trade many observers in the region see a deeper 
and to some a more sinister reason they describe it as indias 
growing power and ambitions as a major military political and 
economic force in the region 
india rejects such contentions 
nepals strength is in its majestic mountains and mystique that 
attract the tourists who provide about 20 percent of the countrys 
foreign exchange earnings another 20 percent comes from the export 
of carpets a business dominated by tibetan refugees who fled 
chinese rule in their homeland across the border 
its chief weakness is poverty nepals per capita annual income 
is 150 the world bank and united nations childrens fund record 
only two other countries with equal or worse economic misery 
bhutan where the per capita income also is 150 and ethiopia 
where it is 120 
nepal cannot remain an island of poverty any longer between 
the two countries in the region that are growing india and 
china foreign minister shailendra kumar upadhyaya said in an 
interview nepal also has to grow 
growth he added includes expanding ties beyond india 
india with a population of 880 million and nepal with 17 
million people had a special relationship between 1950 when 
the mountain kingdom emerged from hermitlike isolation and last 
march 23 when their trade and transit treaties lapsed 
nepal seeking to lessen dependence on its big neighbor has 
been steadily diversifying its trading partners over the past 15 
years but to import goods it relied on preferential rights to use 
indias seaports railroads and highways 
this year nepal wanted to renew the two separate trade and 
transit treaties but india insisted on a single treaty linking the 
two issues saying it was unfair for nepal to expect generous 
transit privileges to import goods from other nations which often 
as foreign minister upadhyaya and other nepalese officials 
acknowledged end up getting smuggled back to india and sold at a 
profit 
in 1975 82 percent of nepals foreign trade was with india by 
april 1989 it had shrunk to 28 percent according the fiscal 
198889 economic survey issued in july by king birendras 
government 
the proposed 198990 budget released at the same time calls 
for expenditures of about 736 million with a deficit of 818 
million to be financed primarily by foreign and domestic borrowing 
one of the biggest increases is in petroleum products which 
nepal has started purchasing on the international market instead of 
buying from india itself a net importer of oil 
petroleum and other nepalese imports still pass through india 
but india closed 13 of the 15 authorized border transit points when 
the march treaties lapsed and hassles at the two remaining points 
still crop up periodically 
for the nepalese consumer this has resulted in rationing and 
skyrocketing prices although the gasoline shortage of last spring 
and early summer is starting to ease most nepalese dont have 
cars but those who do are now paying the equivalen of 318 a 
gallon instead of 218 a gallon

generations of fishermen reaped a bounty 
from the lambro river before it became laced with garbage smelly 
sewage and pesticides 
today the italy beloved by poets authors and artists hides much 
of its legendary beauty in a pall of smog acres of concrete and 
millions of tons of industrial waste and urban garbage its waters 
are becoming poisoned its landscape scarred its forests withered 
by acid rain 
ecologists see the lambro as one symptom of italys allergic 
reaction to its own 20th century they say its fetid banks are a 
result of the feverish postwar economic expansion 
chemical wastes and agricultural runoff contaminate the lambro 
as it flows like a sewer through italys industrial heartland from 
near lake como past milan to just west of piacenza where it empties 
into the po 
the po the countrys longest and most polluted river winds 
through some of italys most fertile farmland before it spills its 
toxins into the increasingly endangered adriatic sea 
the lambro is responsible for 30 percent of the total 
pollution in the po said gianfranco mascazzini an environmental 
official with lombardys regional government so the pollution is 
not only a problem because of what it does in lombardy but also 
because of what it does to the po and the adriatic 
still he noted the pollution is seeping into lombardys soil 
and beginning to contaminate the aquifier that supplies 90 percent 
of milans drinking water 
a year ago the government approved a fiveyear 355 
billionproject to clean the air soil and water around the lambro 
it hailed the plan as a model one that could lead to 22 billion 
in additional spending if extended to the rest of italy 
the work has not begun 
it has been stalled primarily by political squabbling common at 
all layers of italian government various local governments and 
private industry have fought over their share of the financing and 
control of the project 
environmental groups maintain the plan is just another temporary 
remedy doomed to fail because it will not do enough to fight the 
sources of pollution 
mario zerbini a spokesman for the environmental greens party 
and michele mauri a world wildlife fund ecologist contend the 
government is too strongly allied with big business lacks the 
political will to confront longterm problems and reacts only to 
emergencies such as the current algae invasion along adriatic 
coastal resorts 
a recent ministry of the environment report noted that italy has 
only the capacity to legally dispose of about 30 percent of the 
974 million tons of waste it produces each year including 38 
million tons considered toxic or dangerous 
the report said half the 1600 water purification plants in 
cities with a total population of 23 million dont work it added 
that 2 million people in other cities drink water tainted with 
herbicides and pesticides 
the ministry said at least half the trees in italian forests 
suffer damage from acid rain in 1987 alone it said italy coughed 
380000 metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere 2 
percent of the earths emissions of the gas that is considered a 
major contributor to the greenhouse effect or warming of the 
planet 
italy was relatively slow to come to awareness about its 
evironmental problems said christopher flavin a vice president 
with the worldwatch institute in washington dc 
compared to northern europe the air and water quality is worse 
and italy has a lot more toxic wastes it is a result of its 
lagging policies flavin said in a telephone interview 
environment minister giorgio ruffolo said earlier this year that 
the government hopes to reduce pollution by 35 percent to 40 
percent over five years and mascazzini the lombardy environmental 
official argues the lambro plan is a new beginning toward that end 
we agree that it is no longer possible to arrive at 
conclusive effective environmental results by confronting the 
problems a piece at a time mascazzini said the lambro plan is 
an attempt to better organize the realization of so many things so 
many projects 
its intent is to restore the land area between the lambro 
seveso and olona rivers it would build five new water purification 
plants and enlarge 40 others construct new sewer networks pumping 
stations and waste treatment plants 
the plan also would invest millions of dollars to clean the air 
muffle the noise build new parks and nature reserves and add 
safeguards to highrisk industries in densely populated areas

hassan ragabs dreams once fit into a 
bathtub thirty years later they cover an island in the nile and 
have made him not only egypts papyrus king but also pharaoh of a 
imaginary kingdom from the days of king tut 
the realm of the 78yearold former diplomat and engineer is 
jacobs island a finger of land south of cairo where he first 
established a papyrus farm then recreated a 3300yearold 
village to give tourists glimpses of ancient egyptian life from 
flatbottom barges 
papyrus is everywhere on the island 
his love affair with the willowy river plant began in 1955 
after his appointment as egypts first ambassador to china on a 
countryside tour he saw workers making paper by hand 
i thought of my own country once worldfamous for producing 
paper from the papyrus plant he said everything was written 
on it from peace treaties to marriage contracts to medical 
instructions 
but by the middle of the 20th century papyrus was finished in 
egypt except for a few ornamental plants he added i thought 
how great it would be if i could start a little industry making 
paper again 
in 1960 with papyrus stalks he cut in sudan ragab began 
experimenting in his bathtub 
no one else could help him he said because papyrusmaking 
like mummification was so sacred the ancients reserved it for the 
pharaohs 
for six years ragab cut papyrus pulp into strips soaked them 
dried them hammered and pressed them into sheets 
nothing worked 
i was down to my last coin he said even my family 
thought i was stupid one day my wife came in and gave me a choice 
of her or the dirty bathtub 
but fortunately for the papyrus industry and for me i 
discovered my mistakes i still had both a wife and a bathtub 
ragab opened his first papyrus institute which he called one 
of the seven wonders of modern egypt on a little houseboat in 
the nile in 1966 growing the plant in surrounding nile shallows 
his papyrus paper attracted artists who duplicated tomb 
paintings golden faces of king tut and ancient medical manuscripts 
lightweight and exotic papyrus is the only true egyptian 
souvenir ragab said egyptian presidents give papyrus as gifts 
in 1984 president hosni mubarak went to washington with a ragab 
portrait of the sphinx with president ronald reagans face instead 
of a pharaohs 
ragab estimates his industry now earns 100 million a year 
locally 40 million internationally 
but ragabs success was too great hundreds of papyrus factories 
sprang up many making fake paper from banana skins or corn husks 
few tourists could tell the difference 
you even have two villages with 30000 people who gave up 
farming a couple of years ago just to grow make paint and market 
papyrus ragab said 
he then had another idea 
i realized there was no place for a tourist to learn about 
ancient egypt about what he was seeing in the museums he said 
and i looked at jacobs island 
what he saw in his minds eye was a living village from the 
golden days of the new kingdom the time of king tut and ramses 
he started work on it in the early 1980s hired actors to take 
the roles of ancient egyptians and by the time dr ragabs 
pharaonic village opened in 1985 he had poured 8 million into it 
a fortune built with papyrus 
but tourist agencies avoided it and many still do tour books 
didnt mention it and most still dont 
but ragab holds on 
this should be the first stop for any tourist said art 
teacher pat cline of ingleside ill in front of a scaleddown 
pharaonic temple it teaches you so much its going to be one of 
our favorite highlights of egypt 
equally as enthusiastic was dr adel ibrahim a surgeon from 
huntington wva who had brought his wife and three children to 
egypt to learn something of his native land 
its a miracle ibrahim told ragab youve done egypt 
proud 
ragab smiled

soviet tourists starved for consumer 
goods back home are trading caviar for computers and using 
borrowed rubles to buy video cassette recorders 
this video will pay for the trip said natalya a moscow 
housewife in her 40s clutching a vcr at bengurion international 
airport 
everybody is buying videos i wanted to bring another one for 
my son but i did not have the money 
as a result of a thaw in soviet relations with israel thousands 
of soviet jews have been visiting relatives and friends in israel 
en route many stop in larnaca cyprus to purchase electronic 
goods that can be resold in the soviet union where a vcr can fetch 
the equivalent of 10 months salary about 2000 rubles 3140 at 
the official rate of exchange 
natalya and other travelers demanded anonymity because they 
feared reprisals for engaging in black market transactions 
one recent flight from cyprus carried 60 soviet tourists with 26 
vcrs and two doubledeck radiocassette players one georgian 
family was seen pushing a cart with three vcrs 
the tourists are required to leave the vcrs and other goods at 
the airport to be picked up when they leave israel 
some soviet visitors who include musicians and artists of 
soviet touring groups bring luxury items like caviar that are 
scarce in israel to trade for personal computers and other 
electronic equipment 
my refrigerator was packed with caviar tins said shmuel 
weismel an israeli computer programmer in jerusalem who recently 
hosted a soviet theater troupe 
he said the soviets brought french perfume and caviar purchased 
on the black market back home and sold them here for several times 
the price 
they then bought personal computers which cost 2000 to 4000 
in israel an additional 7850 must be paid in customs taxes when 
they arrive back home but once in the soviet union a computer can 
be sold to a factory or a stateowned business for the equivalent 
of 78500 to 110000 
other soviet visitors select one of a halfdozen israeli firms 
offering a different way to buy electronics 
we offer a transit deal said boris sterenhal of talhen amp 
khanan electronics in the israeli coastal town of netanya soviet 
tourists order taxfree products which are delivered by our 
european branch directly to the soviet union 
the firm which advertizes in some of the seven russianlanguage 
newspapers published in israel offers soviet jews radios tape 
cassette players vcrs televisiion sets and personal computers 
attendants said not a day passes without a soviet coming into 
the store to buy something at least a radio 
but the soviet tourists also buy other things in short supply at 
home 
sonia a retired biochemist from moscow bought a 750 baroque 
freshwaterpearl necklace as a present for her daughter 
in moscow its costs 200 rubles 314 or about an average 
months salary she said 
while the soviet union does not allow the use of hard currency 
to import luxury items it tolerates private imports 
there is a tremendous demand for all kinds of goods that the 
government cant supply said galia golan a soviet specialist at 
hebrew university in jerusalem so they have always permitted the 
black market and the second economy to continue

it is the little numbers not the big and 
obvious ones that cause those inflation troubles while everyone 
is aware of shockingly large numbers it is the little ones that 
undermine economies 
at the moment 4 percent inflation is viewed as moderate and in 
fact some officials proclaim that inflation is under control it 
does look like a small number but repeat it enough and it becomes 
very very big 
four percent inflation cuts a dollar to 50 cents in 13 years it 
adds 22000 to a 100000 house in five years in three years it 
adds 3 cents to the newsstand price of a 25cent newspaper not 
much just 9 or 10 a year 
except for the decade of the 1970s and early 1980s when 
inflation ran away with peoples wallets it has been little 
percentages that have changed the value of our money in 30 years 
the consumer price index has risen more than 300 percent 
in appearance 4 percent is deceitfully small but little 
numbers compound in the same manner as large numbers four percent 
inflation this year becomes part of the base for next years 4 
percent and on and on 
inflation is insidious occurring right under the noses of 
people but somehow obscured from their eyes it happens when small 
prices are raised by small amounts and when big prices are raised 
by seemingly tiny percentages 
when a 22cent postage stamp rose three cents it created a 
temporary hullabaloo but many people recognized 25 cents as the 
next logical plateau for the price but those three pennies 
represented nearly 14 percent if all prices rose at 14 percent a 
year your dollar would be 50 cents in five years 
a suburban weekly newspaper recently jumped to 50 cents from 40 
cents only a dime but a 25 percent increase the fee on a credit 
card went from 20 a year to 30 a 10 difference but a 50 percent 
increase 
most people are aware of the consequences of seemingly small 
increases when translated into percentages but even when they do 
they often excuse it somehow a 50cent item should go to 55 
cents rather than 52 cents 
and when vending machines are involved an increase in a 
50cent candy bar must be at a minimum of 10 percent because the 
machine declines to count mere pennies in this way vending machine 
inflation is created and excused 
inflation also is disguised when expensive items rise by small 
percentages as in a 2 percent increase in car prices that adds 
200 to the tab and a 3 percent rise that adds 17000 to a 
100000 house in about five years 
consider that small percentage increase might have been 
sufficient to disqualify thousands of young couples who had been 
saving for a down payment at 20 percent down the dollars needed 
would have jumped to 23400 from 20000 
the same impact is felt when the variable mortgage rate rises by 
onehalf of 1 percent but adds 50 a month to the carrying cost or 
when a small percentage increase in valuation raises the real 
estate tax 150 
watch those little numbers never let them out of your sight 
never trust them in just the past 10 years they have driven up the 
price of milk 33 percent singlefamily homes 67 percent new cars 
46 percent 
they are devious deceitful and misleading they delude 
otherwise thoughtful responsible people while the blockbuster 
numbers get blamed those little ones hide like termites in the 
foundation

ten years after gleaming silver trains started 
rolling along the souths first rapidtransit system a 1582mile 
network of 150 bus routes and two rail lines with 29 stations 
carries a quartermillion passengers a day 
the metropolitan rapid transit authority has been hailed for its 
safety and cleanliness marta celebrated its trains 10th birthday 
with a freeride day on july 4 that drew a record 435000 
passengers a revitalized underground atlanta draws up to 100000 
extra passengers a week many of them firsttime riders 
but marta has a problem it increasingly goes where much of 
atlanta isnt 
when marta was launched in 1971 the three suburban counties 
that refused it cobb to the northwest gwinnett to the northeast 
and clayton to the south were largely rural and it was hard to 
imagine subway cars rolling past farms and forests those three 
counties now hold nearly 900000 people threefourths the number 
in the two central counties fulton and dekalb where marta runs 
despite suburban traffic that is getting worse and suburban jobs 
that go begging because carless workers cant reach them 
opposition to expanding the system remains joining would almost 
surely mean higher taxes and suburban politicians have been loathe 
to submit to decisionmakers in atlanta 
but the chief reason given by many opponents is the fear marta 
will bring crime to their tranquil neighborhoods that feeling is 
widely seen as racism martas passengers reflect central atlanta 
which is predominantly black 
atlantans may not like to discuss it but few havent heard the 
acronym explained as moving africans rapidly through atlanta 
the people you hear opposing marta in cobb and gwinnett 
theyve been pretty open about it they dont want black people 
coming into their areas said the rev joseph lowery a civil 
rights leader and a member of martas board since 1975 its 
blind prejudice and fear 
we feel its in everyones interest to have a regional transit 
agency providing all the service said general manager kenneth m 
gregor it makes sense its much more costeffective 
unencumbered by the problems of numerous political jurisdictions i 
think that position ultimately will prevail 
i think martas future is contingent on that said lowery 
its maximum potential will never be realized until we go north to 
cobb and gwinnett and south to clayton we at least need five 
counties 
endoftheline stops on martas crossshaped rail system do a 
booming business as thousands of cobb and gwinnett residents drive 
across the county line and hop on the train some luxury hotels in 
cobb have even sent vans to ferry workers across the chattahoochee 
river which marks the county line 
but marta trains and buses arent going to cross that bridge 
anytime soon 
theyre pretty much against it at least in my end of the 
county said gwinnett county commissioner curtis mcgill a 
number of the people who have moved into the south end are 
transplants from dekalb county and a lot of them feel like marta 
ran them out of town 
without being obvious people say that ease of transportation 
would bring in the undesirables and crime said gwinnett county 
commission chairman lillian webb who has advocated at least a 
trial run of marta buses 
even talking about marta can be tricky in the suburbs a 
discussion group with cobb county leaders in 1980 had a code name 
so folks wouldnt know about it gregor said 
but more and more suburban atlanta may be coming to the 
conclusion that something must be done a onemile trip down a 
major thoroughfare in cobb or gwinnett can take more than a 
halfhour and residents of those counties named traffic as their 
no 1 problem in a recent atlanta journalconstitution poll 
the poll found between 54 percent and 60 percent of cobb 
gwinnett and clayton county residents favored marta trains in their 
communities although only in cobb county were a majority willing 
to pay the 1 percent sales tax that fulton and dekalb county 
residents pay for marta 
meanwhile cobb county last month launched its own fiveroute 
bus system ten thousand people used it the first week more than 
twice the volume expected for the first three weeks forcing 
officials to drop a radio advertising campaign for fear they 
wouldnt be able to meet the demand 
the busiest cobb community transit route is one dropping 
commuters at a midtown atlanta marta subway station ultimately 
the service plans 10 routes including three more atlanta express 
runs riders get free transfers to marta under a deal that allows 
marta riders to hop on cobb countys buses 
the system costing the county an estimated 2 million a year 
makes more sense than giving marta an estimated 65 million a year 
in local sales taxes said craig aronoff chairman of the cct 
advisory board it doesnt look like it would make sense to 
provide more than we provide martas the best system in the 
country but it doesnt have all the answers 
in my judgment theyre fooling themselves gregor said 
ten bus routes arent going to even dent arent going to put an 
infinitesimal impact on their traffic congestion and starting a 
bus system that brings four routes in the city of atlanta aint 
going to do it 
clayton county has no public transportation gwinnett which has 
none either will vote next year on some sort of mass transit 
referendum mrs webb hopes it will once and for all answer 
questions like what the county wants and will pay for 
i hope theyll use reason and understanding rather than 
illogical rationale she said pointing out that the countys 
330000 population will more than double in the next 20 years 
the sheer mathematics of it says we have got to come up with some 
method of handling all those people 
its inevitable its time to fish or cut bait

michael wilding made his film debut as a 
street urchin when his mother elizabeth taylor played kate in 
taming of the shrew in italy 
richard burton his stepfather at the time played petruchio in 
the 1967 film 
i ran alongside petruchios horse on the way to the wedding 
said wilding who has joined the cast of cbs dallas 
my brother christopher wilding was also an extra i had 
braces on my teeth and we wore little codpieces and velvet caps we 
kept shouting petruchio petruchio

years in favor of education his major role so far was that of 
jesus christ in the nbc miniseries ad 
the son of taylor and the late michael wilding sr has his 
mothers violet eyes and dark complexion his black hair has 
streaks of gray 
wilding will play art dealer alex barton in the new dallas

the young artist is callie harper ewing the wife of jr ewing 
played by cathy podewell a romantic interest develops between the 
two larry hagman of course is jr 
i havent had any scenes with larry wilding said so far 
jr doesnt know anything about us or he isnt interested enough 
theres such a contrast between barton and callie hes incredibly 
worldly and sophisticated and shes a country girl 
i think he feels he can steer her into becoming a worldly and 
stylish person with a bit of tutoring he wants to change her 
personally id leave her the way she is shes a very sweet lady 
more recently wilding had a small role in one of his mothers 
projects sweet bird of youth for nbc he plays a movie

most major protestant denominations which once 
widely condoned abortion now either oppose it or specify 
limitations to it theyve modified their positions 
the changes have come over the last decade as abortions went on 
at the rate of about 15 million a year and advances in embryology 
increased understanding of the developing fetus 
aware of such factors denominational conventions one after 
another have qualified their stands on abortions voicing 
misgivings about it and condemning use of it for various purposes 
theyve backpedaled said the rev j robert nelson 
director of the institute of religion of the texas medical center 
in houston 
he said the staggering statistics and the new therapeutic 
embryology on distinctive characteristics of the fetus as not part 
of the womans body have made for second and third thoughts 
about abortion 
the whole movement toward more conservative religious 
positions also doubtlessly accounts to some extent for the shift 
he added in a telephone interview 
the revisions began long before the recent us supreme court 
decision expanding state jusisdiction on the issue but became 
general among mainline denominations in the 1980s 
although recognizing abortions legality and individual 
decisionmaking about it four major protestant denominations last 
year added extensive circumstances in which it was rejected 
the episcopal church stiffening its past stance sanctioned 
abortion only in extreme situations we emphatically oppose 
abortion as a means of birth control family planning sex 
selection or any reason of mere convenience 
the united methodist church while recognizing tragic 
conflicts of life with life that may justify abortion added 
opposition to it as a means of birth control or gender selection 
the presbyterian church usa added language saying abortion 
should not be used for convenience or to ease embarrassment or as 
a means of birth control the church now engaged in a major 
reappraisal of the abortion issue has scheduled a proandcon 
dialogue on it nov 1719 in kansas city 
american baptist churches in a revised middleground stance 
denounced irresponsible sexual behaivor contributing to the 
large number of abortions each year and says 
as american baptists we oppose abortion as a means of 
avoiding responsibility for conception as a primary means of birth 
control without regard for the farreaching consequences of the 
act 
however the united church of christ maintains a clearly 
prochoice position reaffirming it in july at a general synod in 
fort worth texas at the same time the high court upheld some 
state prerogatives on the issue 
the denomination deplored the court decision charging it would 
make freedom of choice difficult for the poor it also 
however set a special theology colloquy on the the subject 
aug 1318 in craigville mass 
while roman catholicism eastern orthodoxy the church of jesus 
christ of latterday saints mormons the lutheran churchmissouri 
synod and various evangelical churches have steadily condemned 
abortion several protestant bodies joined that effort near the 
turn of the l980s 
about that time the nations biggest protestant body southern 
baptists began stiffening opposition to abortion and now condemns 
it in all cases except to save the life of the mother 
the former lutheran church in america now merged into the 
evangelical lutheran church in america toughened its antiabortion 
stand in 1980 and 1984 when it opposed all abortions as destroying 
life 
laws were urged protecting it from conception to birth 
episcopalians revising their position about it last year voted 
down proposed language that would have opposed legislative 
restrictions on abortion such legislatives moves incubated 
following the recent high court decision 
orthodox jews condemn abortion except when the mothers life is 
endangered while reform and conservative judaism approve it in 
less threatening situations 
the national council of churches including most major 
protestant and eastern orthodox denominations has never taken a 
position on abortion because of diverse views about it 
most churches historically had condemned abortion prior to the 
1973 supreme court ruling allowing it but mainline protestant 
bodies afterward moved to support the decision and right of women 
to abortion 
while some still uphold that right theyve raised sharpened 
reservations about it of the keen stress over the issue episcopal 
presiding bishop edmond l browning said 
we know that at its heart abortion involves tragedy as the 
loss of any life or promise of life can be tragic the reasons for 
abortions can involve other tragedies 
our discussion of abortion must begin with an understanding 
that we are dealing with a tangled web of rights and wrongs good 
and evil and greater and lesser tragedies

that was basically what led to the berlin wall the best and 
the brightest were bailing out of east germany he said one 
reason communist economies have done so poorly is because the cream 
always was skimmed off 
china expert leo a orleans in an analysis written for the 
committee on scholarly communication with the peoples republic of 
china said even before tiananmen square that any decision by 
chinese students to remain abroad would be seen by china as not 
only a loss to the country in terms of both money spent on their 
education and their potential contribution to chinas development 
but also a painful loss of face 
the flight of intellectual capital has been of great concern 
to all developing countries especially since those individuals who 
tend to remain abroad are precisely the ones with the greatest 
initiative and enterprise orleans observed 
china depended upon foreign schooling as a way of leaping into 
the 21st century china itself was capable of granting a piddling 
664 phds between 1981 and 1987 
before leaving home chinese students are warned that their 
parents may suffer if they dont return orleans said 
betty vetter executive director of the commission of 
professionals in science and technology said china put its 
traveling students on tight timetables two years for earning a 
masters degree five for a phd and then home again please 
american students usually take eight years for a phd and thats 
without a language barrier to overcome 
the brain drain troubles american allies too canada loses 
talent to the lure of the big market to the south and england 
loses faculty british universities are cutting back on staffing 
and many major american universities are picking up the stars of 
the british academic world said dan greenberg editor and 
publisher of science amp government report 
if chinas students now in this country stay could the united 
states absorb them 
profitably greenberg said many are in mathematics and 
engineering where shortages exist 
whether they stay or go home said ms vetter training foreign 
students is a good deal for the us for all kinds of reasons 
some stay and become an essential part of the work force those who 
go home generally take a sense of americana and americans that 
will stand us in good stead in the global economy if all goes as 
it ought to they will think fondly of america and thats bound to 
be a benefit

the federal reserves easing of its credit 
policy and the accompanying drop in interest rates have posed a 
325 billion question for investors in money market mutual funds 
should they sit tight with their money in the face of declining 
yields or look elsewhere for better returns 
if the past record is any guide the vast majority of money fund 
assets will stay put 
from 1975 when the earliest money funds had attracted less than 
4 billion to this year when their assets have swollen by more 
than 50 billion from 272 billion at the end of 1988 the 
longterm industry trend has shown almost uninterrupted growth 
periods of low or falling interest rates halted the funds 
expansion only briefly 
in 1983 for example when interest rates were falling and 
stocks were soaring in the early stages of a spectacular bull 
market money fund assets shrank by about 20 percent a year later 
they rebounded once again to new highs 
todays savers and investors have a wider range of competitive 
alternatives to choose among than ever before 
and thanks to rallies in the stock and bond markets funds that 
invest in those longterm securities have been producing 
substantially higher returns than money funds have offered 
late last month donoghues moneyletter a newsletter that 
tracks developments affecting fund investors issued a buy 
signal recommending a move from money funds to growth stock funds 
for venturesome investors 
but with all that many investors especially those who view 
their money fund holdings as a kind of modernday savings account 
may find few other choices that appeal more to them on the basis of 
both risk and potential reward 
the risks of stock market investing of course are well 
advertised at a recent yield of 885 percent analysts point out 
money funds still offer rewards close to the historical average 
annual return of 9 percent to 10 percent posted by the stock market 
what about the other alternatives taxfree money funds 
investing in state and local government securities whose interest 
is not subject to federal taxation recently were yielding about 
56 percent to 57 percent 
that put them at an unattractive level by donoghues reckoning 
even for an investor in the 33 percent bracket 
bank moneymarket deposit accounts have the allure of federal 
deposit insurance but their typical yields of about 65 percent 
languish far below their money fund competitors 
people wanting to lock in yields as protection against further 
declines in interest rates traditionally turn to longterm bond 
investments these days however they arent very well compensated 
for making that commitment 
in late july the yield available on the longestterm treasury 
bonds slipped below 8 percent 
doubledigit yields can still be found in abundance in socalled 
junk bonds and the mutual funds that specialize in these 
lowerrated securities but some advisers say this is an especially 
dangerous time to be increasing credit risk 
much of the newly issued junk securities have not been 
tested in a period of prolonged adversity says the bostonbased 
united amp babson investment report a sacrifice in yield is well 
worth the price of safety and a good nights sleep 
indeed while investors are casting a wary eye on the other 
options analysts say they may want to give their money funds a 
fresh appraisal as well 
sponsors of two funds the value line cash fund and the liquid 
green trust reached into their own pockets in june to cover losses 
that resulted from a default on shortterm securities issued by 
integrated resources inc 
as a result of their response fund shareholders lost no money 
but the experience was a humbling lesson as donoghues 
described it for an industry that prides itself on its safety 
record

it takes a mighty aggregation of man machine 
and fossil fuel power to move the gross national product a 
fraction of a point but in washington it can be done by 
researchers using only calculator power 
they do it again and again month after month revising 
important economic measurements some of which might have been 
when first announced the basis for decisions regarding business 
and economic policy 
revisions are a regular occurrence in statistics produced 
mainly by access to additional information or changes in 
methodology in some instances they are expected in some they are 
not in either event they can dismay 
several years ago for example rising retail sales were 
reported month after month giving the impression of a boom but 
when viewed after a year sales had risen only moderately 
the reason the monthly increases were based not on original 
figures but on later revisions repeatedly those revisions were 
downward meaning increases for the following months were from a 
base lower than originally stated 
some important revisions recently were made in estimates of 
gross national product perhaps the broadest of all economic 
measurements and one that often guides the direction of fiscal and 
monetary policy 
this revision raised the growth of real gnp for 1987 to 37 
percent from 34 percent a difference of 67 billion and for 
1988 to 44 percent from 39 percent a difference of 283 billion 
those arent puny numbers even in an economy where the value of 
a billion shrinks by the day in fact they are momentous figures 
when you consider that overheating vs recession was one of the 
biggest economic concerns in each of those years and that the gnp 
measurement was one of the primary indicators 
whatever decisions must be made in a critical time frame too 
immediate to wait for revisions 
battles are fought with the weapons on hand not with arsenals 
promised gen dwight eisenhower launched an invasion of europe 
after reading weather reports later found to be faulty later 
president eisenhower steered economic policy although in review 
the economic data he relied upon was less than perfect 
statistical faults are accepted the attitude seeming to be that 
nothing better is available if poor decisions are made so be it 
if good news comes in the revision enjoy it and hope it wont be 
revised out later 
good news did indeed come in the july revisions for one thing 
they made the trade deficit appear less ominous in one swipe 
erasing more than 25 billion from the negative 1988 numbers 
in 1988 it is now believed that the deficit stated in 1982 
dollars was 749 billion not 1002 billion the main reason for 
the revisions it now appears is that the exporting of 
education and tourism was undercounted 
well not quite in the language of the fraternity each was 
enhanced but the net impact is the same no matter what 
language is used so big was the enhancement that one economist 
robert barbera of shearson lehman hutton inc issued a comment in 
a language seldom heard from economists wow he said 
how significant is it he asked plenty he said explaining 
that the trade picture in goods and services is simply that much 
better and the case for foreign investor panic about us 
imbalances is all but over 
economists are known to disagree of course not all are saying 
wow some will claim the improvement would have been more 
meaningful if it involved the export of pig iron rather than 
education not barbera 
as we see it it is better to have stateoftheart schools 
vs stateoftheart steel mills he declares 
besides the dollars count no matter how they are earned or 
when they are added to the accounts or even if it takes some 
recalculations to discover them

the goose hangs by its feet from 
a thick rope stretched across the town square on the feast day of 
santiago the patron saint of spain a rider on horseback passes 
underneath and yanks the head off 
he has his prize and the crowd cheers another goose is brought 
out and strung up for another rider 
critics call it barbarous 
but to the thousands of spaniards in the villages and towns 
yearly fiestas that often involve the ritualistic killing of a 
goose or a rooster or a bull are an essential part of their lives 
and an affirmation of their cultural identity 
none of the onlookers at the fiesta in this agricultural village 
of 2500 near the tagus river in the rolling hills of central spain 
could say for certain why the eight male riders dressed in black 
britches and embroidered jackets try to pull the heads off geese 
but they know young men have been doing it every july 25 the 
feast day for 400 years at least 
the practice gained notice abroad about five years ago when 
photographs of the event appeared in the british press headlines 
called the spaniards barbarians and worse nowadays the geese have 
been injected with a tranquilizer 
theyre numb they dont feel anything thats all ill say 
said mayor pedro villalba cedeno 
anthropologists surmise that the practice grew out of a 
celebration of the legendary appearance of santiago or st james 
at the battle of navas de tolosa in 1212 sparking a christian 
victory over the moors 
the geese represent the moors who ruled much of spain for more 
than 700 years 
in some towns the sacrificial victim is a bull whose 
ritualistic importance in spain can be traced back to the 
prehistoric caves across the northern part of the country and to 
the iberian culture that predates the romans 
the bulls at one time were burned alive now the ends of their 
horns are set alight with flaming balls of tar sending the bulls 
into panicked flight young boys chase them and beat them with 
sticks until the fire in the tar balls dies out in one town the 
bulls are killed after that but in others they are then left alone 
in other towns bulls are driven over cliffs into the sea 
townspeople rescue them from the water but if the bulls break 
their legs or are otherwise injured they are taken to the slaughter 
house 
julio caro baroja the dean of spanish anthropologists has done 
extensive studies of the fiestas their relation to the seasonal 
cycle and the role of animals in them 
the ritual killing of animals he writes serves an expiatory 
function that has been incorporated if not explicity sanctioned 
by the roman catholic church 
in el carpio de tajo a rider carrying the religious banner of 
st james precedes the goosebeheaders 
weve received hundreds of letters of protest from foreigners 
whove read about the geese and other fiestas involving animals 
said alicia tiemblo diaz head of information at spains 
secretariat for tourism ive talked to town officials who tell 
me let them complain its our fiesta and well keep on doing it 
the way we want 
the spanish animal rights association has joined forces with 
other european organizations to encourage governments of the 
12member european economic community to pass legislation banning 
cruelty to animals there is little likelihood such action will 
prosper in spain 
our fiestas are cruel i didnt realize how cruel they were 
until i started going out and studying them said guadalupe 
gonzalez hontoria director of the museum of popular arts and 
traditions at madrids autonomous university we spaniards do 
have our brutish side but we can also be very brave 
during the 36year dictatorship of gen francisco franco many 
fiestas particularly those that emphasized regional or local 
characteristics were suppressed prelenten carnivals were banned 
as being too licentious until authorities figured out that it drew 
tourism 
following the return to democracy 12 years ago mrs gonzalez 
hontoria said spaniards began to celebrate their fiestas with 
renewed gusto 
it seems now with modernization everyone wants to go back to 
his roots and people see that they can lose their fiestas if they 
dont defend them

this land of drug cartels and violence 
is also the land of beautiful flowers and those who grow them are 
about to launch an advertising campaign to get americans and 
canadians to buy more of them 
we counter the violence of drugs with the beauty of our 
flowers as a real image representing colombia more than anything 
else said jorge enrique uribe president of the colombian 
flowers exporters association 
years of sustained efforts to produce popular flower types 
particularly carnations and chrysanthemums in addition to the 
exotic specimens native to colombia have earned colombia a 
respectable second place after the netherlands among 
flowerexporting nations 
flowers represented 205 million last year in export revenues 
more than double the amount of 1980 next year could be another 
alltime record for colombian growers and dealers if their goal of 
260 million in exports is met 
colombias 8 percent to 10 percent share of the international 
market over recent years surpassing israel and italy reflects the 
drive of its flourishing nontraditional export industry 
all this despite all sorts of difficulties including 
embarassing actions by drug traffickers who often smuggle cocaine 
with shipments of flowers last year a cargo plane of avianca the 
colombian national airline was seized in miami after the police 
found cocaine concealed in the soil of a flower shipment 
fined 3 million avianca halted its overseas cargo operations 
and colombian florists had to look for other airlines to ship their 
flowers at much higher rates 
flower shipments now are subject to stricter controls at the 
bogota airport in an effort to detect hidden drugs 
flowers uribe said are innocent victims of drug 
traffickers 
flower cultivators like any other businessmen are constantly 
adapting to the mood of customers 
flowers are like clothes colors and taste for them change 
uribe said and we have to follow the customers whims 
flowers began as a tiny portion of colombian exports in the 
mid1960s when they accounted for less than 100000 annually 
colombian florists feel confident that their business will be 
rosier if the 8 million advertising campaign to persuade americans 
and canadians to buy more flowers is successful 
studies by colombia florists associations indicate americans and 
canadians buy flowers mostly to give to others and rarely for 
themselves 
europeans take flowers to their homes as much as they send 
them as gifts uribe said our studies demonstrate that west 
germans famous for their lavish preference for flowers buy as 
much as eight times more flowers than canadians and americans 
colombian floriculturists joined the 28000member us florists 
transworld delivery association to launch the advertising campaign 
which begins in september 
the future lies in convincing americans and canadians to 
change habits and persuade them to buy flowers for themselves 
too uribe said

on this wednesday one of the people theyd 
nourished day after day hopefully and compassionately died it 
was all too usual 
word of the death was passed around the office and at a 
storefront church in harlem the mans neighborhood but gods love 
we deliver inc kept up its work feeding people who are confined 
to their homes by aids 
we deal with it all the time said program director joan 
block it may be harder in some ways but it is also much richer 
the issue of life and death is the great magnifying glass 
i dont get it when people ask how we can do this its not as 
if if you worked in a bank you never had to handle the death issue 
this is a really great training program for what is inevitable for 
all of us 
i dont think any of us is qualified to find a cure for 
aids said carl johnes one of 450 volunteers who make sure 
nearly 200 homebound aids patients get gourmet highcalorie food 
five days a week but we are qualified to keep people alive until 
such time as a cure is found so its a lifesaving job 
there is eloquence in the preparation and delivery of 
nourishment that provides a bounty beyond calories 
on valentines day the delivery to gary gruber a manhattan 
landscaper included heartshaped cookies and roses i opened it 
up expecting a meal and it was a party i started crying from 
happiness 
there were flowers and cake on his 39th birthday i didnt 
know they knew he said but they said it was all in the 
computer 
early one morning eight people chat in the small wellequipped 
kitchen in the basement at west park presbyterian church in 
manhattan they fill plastic containers of cream of mushroom soup 
and containers of pasta hamburger and carrots and peas there 
also are a salad and homemade cookies this day 
soup and vegetables cook in stock pots on two stoves the air is 
stifling and two fans do far less than volunteers attitudes to 
ease the discomfort 
a visitor pitches in as she looks over the program with an eye 
to starting something similar in los angeles later in the day the 
power goes out and hurried plans are made to protect the food the 
clients still need meals 
in the kitchen there is gentle banter about a book someone 
will write or their own efficiency no one complains and no hands 
are allowed to remain idle newcomers are warmly welcomed often 
with a hug but then an apron is given over and a chore assigned 
these are people with a mission 
we all do it because it makes us feel good it isnt about 
being a saint said johnes a writer from manhattan 
gods love produces madefromscratch meals from a rotating 
30day menu that includes carrot bisque artichoke salad smoked 
turkey shish kebab fourcheese lasagna veal stroganoff pears in 
puff pastry and fruit bavarian 
we have a big food budget and we buy top quality but were 
pretty frugal said chef luli gray who saves the drippings from 
one days beef for another days soup or sauce leftovers are 
packed marked and frozen for use 
a walkin refrigerator was donated by the gay mens chorus 
gods love needs a bigger kitchen it always needs money and 
volunteers as aids spreads from homosexual men to intravenous drug 
users their lovers and their children the work will only increase 
the goal is that no homebound person with acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome ever goes hungry we are dedicated to not 
putting anybody on a waiting list said gary bressler the 
organizations executive chef 
clients had lost an average of 18 pounds from the onset of aids 
to the time they began receiving meals but gained an average of 10 
pounds after meals were delivered bressler said 
one symptom of aids is loss of appetite so he works to make 
sure the food is not only nutritious and fattening but appetizing 
we try to keep their weight up and thats adding to their 
strength and thats what were here for 
cooking begins daily at 730 am and meals go into four vans 
by 10 am when work starts on tomorrows meals by 230 pm 
everyone has been fed the kitchen closes at 9 
when the kitchen opened in august 1987 we were serving six 
meals now were serving 160 to 180 said bressler 
meals go to all five new york city boroughs and jersey city 
nj some are delivered directly to homes others are left at 
churches homes a red cross office or bars where neighborhood 
volunteers take them to people with aids twentyfive or 30 meals a 
day are made to suit special medical needs 
johnes came to gods love as a volunteer after donating money 
for a year and deciding that wasnt enough i came the friday 
night before christmas and made orange zest crushed garlic and 
peeled 25 pounds of cucumbers i went to bed smelling like a 
salad on christmas day he delivered meals 
nourishment is important he said its not controversial 
how can you argue with people who feed other people 
gods love we deliver was conceived in 1985 when ganga stone 
now executive director took groceries to a man suffering from aids 
and was horrified to find him too weak to get up and cook the food 
she decided to do something 
first she cooked at home and delivered meals on her bicycle 
then meals were solicited from restaurants finally in august 
1987 gods love moved to west park presbyterian from a woman on 
her bike gods love grew to a staff of 22 and a budget for 1989 of 
more than 1 million it is financed by the new york state 
nutrition assistance program and other donations and grants 
originally clients were mostly white homosexual men now 
maybe half are intravenous drug users and their children many are 
women 
when gruber was released from a hospital 1 years ago he called 
gods love at a friends suggestion and talked with stone she 
said how about a meal today or tomorrow then well do the 
paperwork 
when he called gods love i wasnt eating very much id go 
into the kitchen open the refrigerator and think oh thats all 
i can deal with and close it it was too exhausting to do more 
when he did summon the energy to cook gruber said hed make a 
big pot of spaghetti and eat the same food four days straight 
gods love saved my life because i didnt want to eat its 
really the high point of my day

the national black catholic clergy caucus has 
called for study of developing an africanamerican rite within the 
roman catholic church 
such a rite has been urged by a suspended washington dc 
priest the rev george a stallings jr 
brother roy smith caucus president said stallings brought the 
issue of racism within the church to the forefront and heightened 
the discussion of the intensity of those issues 
stallings several weeks ago founded the imani temple a church 
that combines elements of roman catholicism with african and 
southern black traditions he was suspended by cardinal james 
hickey of washington 
the rev victor cohea a caucus board member said the issue of

with scant prospects as mothers but only 1 percent of those 
counseled by birthright centers and 4 percent of those counseled by 
the christian action council centers offer the newborns for

what started as a small ridiculed but exuberant 
religious experience in america around the start of the century has 
swelled into a worldwide christian phenomenon 
called the pentecostal or charismatic movement it is one of the 
fastest growing forces in modern church life spawning young 
denominations and stimulating old ones 
there is no question but that it is revitalizing christianity 
across the world particularly the older forms of christianity 
said the rev david b barrett a top authority on religious 
demographics 
a large influential branch of that movement in america the 
assemblies of god marks its 75th anniversary at its convention 
aug 813 in indianapolis bustling and confident 
god has been very good to us and were grateful for it said 
the rev g raymond carlson of springfield mo the denominations 
general superintendent 
there is enthusiasm growth awakening everythere he added 
in a telephone interview we feel the future is very bright and 
thats not just puff 
barrett a british anglican editor of the world christian 
encyclopedia now working for the southern baptist foreign missions 
board in richmond va said the worlds pentecostalscharismatics 
total 353 million 
that includes 184 million pentecostal church members 23 million 
of them in north america 133 million charismatics in mainline 
churches 44 million in the us and 30 million third wave 
renewalists 12 million in the us 
its happening on a vast scale barrett said in a telephone 
interview the movement has a strong moral and ethical side from 
every point of view its a major and positive development 
the assemblies of god with more than 21 million us 
adherents has grown 66 percent in the last decade from just under 
13 million putting it among the nations 10 largest protestant 
denominations 
its missionaries have planted overseas branches totaling an 
additional 162 million 
with headquarters in springfield mo it has 18 us colleges 
including a seminary and runs several healthcare facilities its 
gospel publishing house turns out an average of 24 tons of 
religious literature a day 
in surmounting the downfall in sex scandals of two of its 
prominent tv ministers jim bakker and jimmy swaggart the 
denomination gained widened respect for its principled handling of 
the matter 
it firmly revoked ministerial credentials when disciplines were 
rejected although in doing so it gave up large revenues including 
12 million annually from swaggarts former ministry 
but supportive response has been far greater carlson said 
noting that contributions to worldwide ministries were up 99 
percent to 284 million for the last biennium 
we made our decision not on the basis of money but on the 
basis of what scripture teaches he said ive been so grateful 
that weve heard from many denominational leaders in appreciation 
for our reinforcing the credibility of the church in the world 
while the assemblies of god has kept growing in contrast to 
mainline membership declines the gains have slackened lately 
there are ebbs and flows carlson said 
asked if the denomination at its 75year mark might be 
succumbing to institutional cumbersomeness sapping its initial 
spontaneity and enthusiasm carlson said 
i dont think so we keep talking about that warning against 
it and listening to the counsel of the word of god reminding the 
church not to lose the fervor that the holy spirit loosed in it 
the indianapolis convention is to launch the denominations most 
ambitious evangelism program decade of harvest 
it envisions winning 5 million people to christ opening 5000 
new churches and training 20000 new ministers in the next decade 
with 1 million prayer partners praying daily for it 
weve tried to keep evangelism alive carlson said a lot 
of people think that glossolalia speaking in tongues is our 
main doctrine but its not rather its the message of christs 
salvation he meets the needs of humanity 
however speaking or singing in unknown tongues is a 
hallmark of the assemblies of god and other pentecostals as well as 
the charismatic incursion in mainline protestantism and roman 
catholicism 
founded at a convention in hot springs ark in 1914 the 
assemblies of god stemmed from heightened spiritual experiences in 
small groups across the united states beginning in 1901 
other pentecostal denominations also arose from the 
tonguesspeaking revival sometimes ridiculed as holy rollers 
but that changed as the denomination matured carlson said 
weve moved across the tracks our congregations build nicer 
buildings and we reach into the upper middle class 
tonguesspeaking considered a sign of baptism by the holy 
spirit derives from apostolic times first experienced 50 days 
after christs resurrection at pentecost in jerusalem and 
described in early christian congregations 
historic churches shunned such practices contending they ended 
with apostolic times but such experiences have spread through 
protestantism and catholicism as the charismatic movement 
it has touched most mainline denominations carlson said 
its had a great deal of impact

move over topps you have new competition 
but the baseball cards being marketed by the us postal service to 
promote stamp sales wont have the trademark piece of bubble gum 
inside 
the post office is easing into the card business with just four 
of the popular collectibles as part of a push to shift from the 
image of a neighborhood store into a modern marketing machine 
probably the most visible effort in this change will come in 
september in a joint campaign promoting postage stamps featuring 
dinosaurs in conjunction with mca incs home video release of the 
movie the land before time 
but this isnt the first tiein between stamps and other 
businesses and it wont be the last said gordon c morison 
assistant postmaster general for philatelic and retail services 
the baseball cards for example take advantage of previously 
issued stamps honoring popular ballplayers the stamps featuring 
lou gherig jackie robinson babe ruth and roberto clemente have 
been combined in a new albumn with four matching baseball cards 
included 
last year a set of stamps featuring carousel animals got special 
promotions at several amusement parks around the country morison 
said and the agency is interested in future arrangements perhaps 
for planned stamps featuring lighthouses and marine mammals 
and new stamps often receive special promotions when issued 
often organized by local post offices 
for example the key west fla office prepared a special 12 by 
16inch print of the recent hemingway stamp in the literary arts 
series 
mounted on a backing with a copy of the stamp canceled on july 
17 its first day of issue the print is being offered for 25 by 
mail order to collectors and hemingway fans 
but the arrangement with steven spielbergs film about dinosaurs 
is the most ambitious effort so far in the effort to boost sales of 
stamps to collectors 
buyers of the home video will receive a little brochure 
advertising the dinosaur stamps offering for sale a tshirt 
featuring one of the stamps and also promoting holiday seals sold 
by the movie company and a special deal from pizza hut 
the dinosaur stamps should appeal to youngsters the tshirts 
and posters to both youngsters and slightly older people morison 
said 
with the movie going on sale in september the promotion arrives 
just in time for stamp collecting month which the post office 
celebrates in october 
the purpose of the effort is simple getting people interested 
in collecting stamps a hobby that means big bucks for an agency 
struggling to cover its ever increasing costs while avoiding 
raising postage rates 
those little piles of stamps collected in envelopes and desk 
drawers across the nation may seem like a small investment to their 
owners 
but to the us postal service collectors represent 150 
million to 170 million in sales annually morison said 
and the best part is its virtually all profit 
a postage stamp is after all nothing more than a receipt for 
advance payment for a service the delivery of a letter or parcel 
when people collect new stamps and save them the post office 
gets its quarter but doesnt have to perform any service for the 
money 
thats the kind of business most companies would love to have 
and one the post office is happy to encourage 
it should please noncollectors too since the profits from 
stamps sold to collectors philatelists is the formal term helps 
subsidize the postal service and thus lowers the costs to people 
who use stamps to get letters delivered somewhere 
since stamps were first issued in the mid1800s the postal 
service has enjoyed the fact that people collect stamps 
occasionally seeing a boost when some collector became famous such 
as president franklin d roosevelt 
but only in recent years has it studied them and sought to 
increase the market 
who collects stamps 
well 75 percent of youngsters have a collection of some type 
said mary margaret grant manager of philatelic services at the 
postal service 
as youngsters enter their teens they find other interests ms 
grant said and the stamp collection usually gets put aside until 
later in life when they marry have families and often get 
interested in stamps again 
it was the nostalgic folks returning to collecting that made 
last years carousel stamps big sellers morison said 
this returning group is about half casual collectors who 
buy stamps they like from time to time but dont make a big deal 
out of it onefourth are accumulators who have some stamps 
often ripping used ones off envelopes and the rest are serious 
collectors buying whole sheets of stamps subscribing to stamp 
publications and following the hobby closely 
the serious collectors lobby the agency for stamps but ms 
grant said officials seek to please all types of collectors 
one thing they have in common is that everybody likes pretty 
stamps morison said although serious collectors lean toward more 
formal engravings while casual collectors seem to prefer more 
colorful productions 
much of the recent marketing efforts is aimed at converting 
casual collectors to serious ones explaining how to mount stamps 
in albums organize them by theme and so forth 
to do this morison has instituted a quarterly series of stamp 
packs including a brochure and all of the colorful commemorative 
stamps issued over three months 
previously sets of stamps were issued just once a year but the 
stamp packs four times annually help spread out the interest 
morison said 
in addition the agency has subscription services for stamp 
collectors to make sure they get all the new stamps that come out 
there are 38000 benjamin franklin stamp clubs for youngsters 
around the country encouraged by the postal service as a means of 
getting youngsters interested in stamp collecting 
meanwhile morison has branched out postal marketing in other 
areas too promoting the sale of stamps in shopping malls and 
supermarkets for example those sales have grown to 500 million 
and the public just loves it he said 
people find it more convenient to buy stamps in supermarkets he 
explained and this also shortens the lines at post offices 
improving service for people who need help from clerks 
shopping mall operations are being planned where people can 
shop and ship morison added 
similar to the postal substations run by many small town stores 
these operations would allow shoppers to buy something at a store 
have it wrapped and then take it to a counter in the mall for 
mailing to a friend or relative without having to make a special 
trip to a post office

fifteen years after richard m nixon resigned 
as president to avoid the disgrace of removal from office 
historians and political observers say the republic paid a price 
but ultimately benefited from the ordeal 
and they say the impact of nixons crisis has been felt by 
every president who followed him chief executives since nixon have 
been more cautious candid and constrained 
washington lawyer philip w buchen who served as an adviser to 
nixons successor gerald r ford says that in retrospect nixons 
resignation was wholesome 
political scientist colin campbell author of managing the 
presidency says the experience left nixons successors pretty 
skittish for a while he thinks jimmy carter for one 
overreacted and was too weak 
historian richard s kirkendall of the university of washington 
says that while the event damaged the presidency it would have 
left us with more serious problems if nixon had been able to get 
away with it 
political scientist jim reichley of the brookings institution 
says the founding fathers pretty clearly expected that the 
impeachment process would be used more often than it has he says 
congress has been intruding on executive functions since it 
found the strength in 1974 to move toward the removal of a 
president 
a dissent comes however from bob hartmann who served as white 
house counselor to ford he says the nearimpeachment of nixon was 
unforunate there are other political remedies which are more 
routine and which can make presidents toe the mark and put the fear 
of god in them if theyre overreaching hartmann contends 
congress for instance can deny funds for presidential 
projects congress can so fix his clock that he cant do 
anything hartmann says 
buchen however says nixons continued tenure in office was 
having an adverse effect on the morale of the country and its 
status around the world it could have led to a threatening 
international incident we did not have a president who was 
actively governing nixon he says was concerned solely with his 
own survival that summer 15 years ago 
on the night of aug 8 1974 a few days after the house 
judiciary committee had recommended impeachment nixon went on 
television to announce that he would resign becoming the first and 
only president to have done so he said he no longer had a strong 
enough political base in congress to carry out the duties of 
office 
three days earlier he had surrendered the smoking gun 
watergate tape it revealed that within a week of the breakin at 
democratic party headquarters at the watergate in 1972 he had 
ordered an end to the fbis investigation whatever remaining 
support nixon had in congress collapsed 
the morning after nixons speech he resigned in a letter to the 
secretary of state and vice president ford took the oath our 
constitution works the new president said our great republic 
is a government of laws and not of men 
with the passage of time a sampling of historians and political 
observers shows agreement with fords assessment and these two 
points 
under the circumstances nixons resignation was healthy for 
the country 
the impact on nixons successors has been to curtail 
presidential adventurism to check the strongpresident 
weakcongress trend that started with franklin d roosevelt and to 
promote presidential candor and accountability 
i think the initial effect was to make presidents much more 
sensitive to the concerns of the public said buchen the exford 
adviser that was true of ford and carter it began to slip at 
the end of the reagan administration or we wouldnt have had the 
irancontra affair 
but even in the irancontra affair noted thomas e mann 
director of governmental studies at the brookings institution the 
record shows that reagans people used the word impeachment 
when discussing the possible consequences of oliver norths secret 
contrafunding activities 
it is important that they were sensitive to the possibility of 
impeachment mann said adding the legacy of nixon assures us 
that some warning signals are present for successive presidents 
even a strong president like reagan found himself 
substantially constrained by an active congres and a whole new set 
of statutes restricting presidential power he said 
watergate resulted in laws in these areas freedom of 
information limits on presidential warmaking powers and a 
presidents ability to impound funds appropriated by congress and 
limits on campaign contributions 
campbell a georgetown university political scientist said he 
finds it almost alarming that it came to the point that we almost 
had to do the same thing with ronald reagan 
he said the presidents age his popularity and his nearness to 
finishing his term saved reagan from an impeachment attempt but he 
finds reagans escape worrisome very seriously damaging to the 
fiber of the republic 
austin ranney chairman of the political science department at 
the university of california at berkeley said the difference 
between watergate and irancontra is that nixon knew what was 
happening while reagan always denied that he knew what was going 
on 
as for whether the nixon experience was good for the country 
ranney said it is never good to have a lawbreaking president but 
it was a wonderful thing that our system of justice and separation 
of powers worked to remove a president without an assassination or 
violence of any kind 
with the exception of hartmann who said we will never know 
the experts interviewed agreed nixon could not have avoided 
removal from office had he not resigned 
at the time he quit every member of the house judiciary 
committee had announced support for his impeachment by the house 
and even such staunch supporters as sen barry goldwater rariz 
had warned nixon he could not win in a trial by the senate 
people had had it with nixon and were finally ready to listen 
to the evidence said campbell 
theres no question he would have been impeached by the house 
and the senate would have convicted him said ranney 
kirkendall said president bushs conduct in office shows that 
bush has learned watergates lesson he noted bush consults 
conspicuously with congressional leaders and allies before making 
major moves he makes a big thing of it he said 
ranney said bush and others have learned that you cant get 
away with anything sooner or later truth will out and the truth 
shows that if you violated the law you will take the 
consequences

corbin bernsen was looking for a new acting 
experience when he accepted the lead role in the mindbending 
thriller breaking point on cable television 
he plays a world war ii american intelligence officer whose 
capture just weeks before dday gives the nazis an opportunity to 
pry out the invasion secrets in a most diabolical and deceptive 
manner 
breaking point gets its first showing on turner network 
television on friday and will be repeated saturday and sunday its 
a remake of the 1964 film starring james garner 
i did it like an alfred hitchcock movie or something from the 
twilight zone says bernsen who stars regularly as lawyer 
arnie becker on nbcs la law 
thats what drew me to it ive always wanted to do something 
in that genre since its for cable we took risks the wonderful 
thing is that after its approved they leave the artists alone to 
do their work its not as pat as regular television the 
experience was that of doing a feature film i wanted to experience 
what my character feels the pain the torture the freedom and to 
be able to have the audience feel it too 
he plays maj jefferson pike who is abducted by the germans 
tortured briefly and wakes to find the war is over and hes in an 
american hospital or so hes led to believe its a plot to learn 
the secrets of dday john glover is the american doctor and 
joanna pacula is the nurse he falls in love with after being told 
his wife has died 
we filmed the exteriors at lake tahoe theres a wonderful old 
school and a retreat that looks like an alpine chalet when i first 
read the script i said great england and germany i can take my 
son to meet his grandparents said bernsen whose wife is 
english actress amanda pays 
well we filmed england in pasadena and germany at lake tahoe 
peter markle directed and it has some interesting camera work 
john glover and i had a great relationship and i think our scenes 
are well written and work well pikes led to believe the wars 
over and he talks about the coming invasion of normandy then he 
finds out hes been deceived and he hatches his own deception 
bernsen did get to europe however he and his wife spent a 
month traveling with their fourmonthold son oliver 
breaking point is bernsens first movie for cable his 
feature film work in a busy schedule in the past few years included 
major league disorganized crime bert rigby youre a 
fool and hello again 
bernsen said he would talk soon to the producers of la law 
to see what would happen to arnie becker next season 
i know what needs to be done he said he needs some 
reevaluation arnie hasnt quite figured it out all life has to 
reproduce but arnies caught in a cycle of refusing to commit 
himself he hasnt grown up enough to accept the moral conventions 
the thing that i put into arnie is that he senses something is 
missing i dont think i could play a character who doesnt 
recognize it 
i think arnie is terrified of marriage as a divorce lawyer he 
knows all the builtin problems i think he also sees it as a 
progression toward death hes trying to hold onto his youth 
he said one of the advantages of doing breaking point is 
that pike is so different from arnie 
its good to do a character who has his values and his 
loyalties straight he said after la law id like to do 
more features ill have had seven years of a family and a house 
and a base i think itd be fun to live and work other places in 
the world id like to base myself in europe for a while i could 
travel and spend time with my wife and son 
bernsen grew up in los angeles his father harry bernsen is a 
former agent and now a producer his mother actress jeanne cooper 
has been on the cbs soap opera the young and the restless for 
the past 15 years 
he said he occasionally works with his father in developing 
projects im working on an idea for a stage musical and i have 
an idea for a series for amanda and myself

it is not uncommon for roy cooper the 
eighttime world champion calf roper to have a lear jet waiting 
motor running to take him from rodeo to rodeo 
no one has an earthly idea what its like to rope at pecos 
texas at 8 am prescott ariz at 2 pm greeley colo at 9 
pm and the next morning at springdale ark said the 
33yearold guru of calf ropers while competing at the 93rd annual 
cheyenne frontier days in late july 
he wasnt complaining he was reveling 
im the second man to win over a million dollars in my 
career said the cowboy from childress texas flashing a 
cerealbox smile and spitting a wad of chew 
im a firstclass cowboy i want it good all the time i like 
good horses pretty women and old whiskey 
and with little effort he gets all three 
but to the vast majority of cowboys on the professional rodeo 
circuit life is an old pickup truck an ace bandage and a cold 
beer to wash the trail dust down 
we sleep in the back seat of the pickup mostly said steer 
wrestler john thompson 27 who grew up on a ranch in san luis 
obispo calif theres lots of times you just want to be home 
thompson is traveling the circuit with three cowboys from 
montana the week before cheyennes daddy of em all the group 
had competed at salt lake city and ogden utah and nampa idaho 
with a 65second time early in the week at cheyenne thompson 
qualified for the sunday finals 
but there was no time for rest in the cowboy state while waiting 
for the finals by the end of the week he had competed in rodeos 
in helena great falls and glasglow mont before returning to 
cheyenne 
theres a misconception of rodeo cowboys everybody thinks we 
drink a lot and raise a lot of heck he said while feeding his 
horse bill its not that way anymore we go to too many rodeos 
we spend more time traveling than anything 
last year thompsons second year of professional rodeo the top 
20 bull dogger entered 123 rodeos in a 270day stretch all the 
while nursing a wounded shoulder 
you have to have some mental preparation he said you 
have to fool yourself and say i feel good im not tired when you 
are tired and you dont feel good 
he does it for one reason to get to the national finals rodeo 
held each year in las vegas only the top 15 in each event qualify 
for the finals last year thompson was 16th 
if someone asked me that day if i wanted to go to a rodeo i 
would have slugged him he said its hard to put that effort 
out and not qualify 
for weekend cowboys however the pressure to win is not as 
intense because the financial security of a working ranch back home 
keeps them afloat 
ive got the best of both said 67yearold calf roper bud 
tillard who owns a sheep ranch in douglas wyo we can go home 
and rest up and its just fine to participate once in a while 
tillard has been roping since he entered competitions at the 
wyoming state fair when he was 6 sixtyone years later he has two 
sons who rope often in the same rodeos and grandchildren who are 
already roping haystacks 
tillard says hes happy with his life and never considered 
trading it for that of a fulltime cowboy 
all theyve got on their mind is roping im calling home and 
saying did they get the hay in he said leaning against a 
corral while awaiting his turn to compete those guys get to 
traveling night and day they forget theyve got a wife and pretty 
soon theyve got another one 
for many roping becomes an addiction and priorities are left in 
the dust 
i know cowboys who have roped their ranch away tillard 
said it gets pretty desperate sometimes these guys dont have 
any money and they go on the road they win a little and by the 
end of the year theyre broke 
but for rookie dano spradlin from buffalo creek colo the life 
of a cowboy is the life of roy cooper who incidently is writing 
a book tentatively titled fast times or victim of success 
its a kind of an unexplained desire said the 26yearold 
who has been on the back of only 18 bucking saddle broncs my 
parents are kind of against it they think the sport is history 
spradlin wrapped a bandage around his midsection favoring a 
back injury from a bad ride before his last ride at cheyenne 
you think about riding correctly being strong getting 
psyched up like a boxer would he said you think about 
winning but most of all staying on 
the young cowboy was bucked off both saddle broncs in the 
cheyenne competition 
its discouraging enough to make you want to get on again 
he said a lot of guys get a real nice buckle and lots of money 
im just doing it for a good time i got the fever

as lawmakers turn their attention to drafting 
a new farm bill one of the most widely discussed topics on capitol 
hill is giving more flexibility to farmers 
its an idea that republicans and democrats seem to agree on 
at least in principle and one that could prove especially 
alluring to a congress seeking ways to cut federal spending 
the truth is our farmers need to be able to produce according 
to farm income consumer needs and environmental concerns rather 
than demands from washington kansas gov mike hayden recently 
told a congressional committee 
although many in agriculture share that goal there is certainly 
no consensus on how to accomplish it 
from the farmers standpoint the problem is vexing 
producers have long complained that government commodity 
programs largely prevent them from varying their cropping plans 
whether its to take advantage of market demands for a commodity or 
to experiment with nontraditional crops 
under current programs farmers have a base acreage for 
traditional crops such as wheat and feed grains that qualify for 
federal subsidies farmers risk reducing that base and the 
potential for federal subsidies in future years if they substitute 
another commodity on some of that land 
in the simplest form proposals for greater flexibility would 
merely allow farmers to substitute crops on some of their base 
acres without any risk of a reduction in future federal farm 
payments 
lawmakers took a step in that direction in a drought relief 
package passed by the house the measure would allow farmers to 
plant up to 20 percent of their permitted acreage with alternative 
crops including sunflowers canola rapeseed and crambe 
but in the early debate over the 1990 farm bill more extensive 
proposals have been suggested 
one of the most prominent is called the triple base plan 
the idea of paying farmers on a reduced percentage of the land 
they usually plant their crop acreage bases has at least two 
major attractions for policymakers concluded a report by the 
congressional research service it would help shrink government 
spending on agriculture but unlike lower target prices the 
reduction would not necessarily amount to a dollarfordollar cut 
in farm income as farmers would still be able to raise other crops 
on their unpaid permitted acres 
under a triple base plan farmers would continue to have an 
overall acreage base if they participated in government commodity 
programs such as for wheat or corn 
as with current programs a percentage of land must be taken out 
of production each year in order to receive government price and 
income supports the new twist however is that a percentage of a 
farmers overall base acreage could be planted in other crops that 
would not be eligible for federal subsidies 
consider the example of a farmer with a wheat base of 100 acres 
the government could require the producer to idle or set aside 10 
percent for conservation purposes the first base the government 
would pay subsidies for a portion of the acres 80 percent for 
instance the second base on the remainder the third base the 
producer could grow a crop to sell on the open market 
proponents say that although farmers would receive smaller 
government subsidy payments than under current programs they could 
partially offset those reductions by selling crops on the market 
from the third base acres 
usda would be able to demonstrate budget savings just as 
though target prices had been reduced but farmers presumably would 
not suffer the same loss in income the study said 
target prices are a governmentfixed rate that helps determine 
the amount of direct income supports received by farmers 
however a number of farm groups have voiced opposition to the 
triplebase plan critics say it is not sound agricultural policy 
but just an indirect way for lawmakers to cut farmsupport 
spending commodity groups also have argued that not all farmers 
can profitably grow more than one crop and they express doubts that 
the triplebase option would do much to encourage producers to 
raise crops that are in short supply such as oats currently 
a study earlier this year by the food and agricultural policy 
research institute a group associated with iowa state university 
and the university of missouri found that with each 1 drop in 
government spending under a triplebase plan farmers would suffer 
an 85 to 90cent drop in net returns 
hayden has recommended a different approach called a total 
farm base program but one aimed at the same flexibility goal 
under it the total acreage bases of all crops subject to 
government commodity programs would be counted together for each 
farmer 
a farmer would be required to idle a portion of the total farm 
base which would provide the government with a tool to continue to 
control overall production but then could plant any mix of crops 
if our farmers had flexibility to plant and produce for 
the market instead of for government programs wed all be better 
served says hayden

salaam bombay virgin vision inc english subtitles 
vhsbeta 7995 
 
salaam bombay is a heartrending look at the homeless street 
children of bombay india but its meanings and nuances transcend 
that exotic locale 
the film which won a number of international film awards in 
1988 is a riveting portrayal of how 20th century societies 
including socalled civilized ones are devouring their young 
alternately selling them or selling them short 
producerdirector mira nair traveled the streets of bombay 
fascinated by the resilience of the thousands of children who 
survive by their wits in a squalid world of dirt drugs and 
prostitution 
she decided to tell their story not with actors but with 
children she gathered from those very backstreets 
salaam bombay is the story of 10yearold krishna 
abandoned first by his mother then by the traveling circus he 
joins he travels to bombay hoping to earn 500 rupees to take back 
to his mother 
krishna acquires street wisdom and a toughness that even leads 
to a murder but somehow almost miraculously he keeps a 
childlike empathy even as he is failing in his own hopes he 
befriends a desperate drug addict and comforts an abject 
16yearold sold by her own mother to a brothel 
the films producers decided to use proceeds to establish 
learning centers for the street children of bombay and delhi 
salaam bombay is not rated it has no objectionable 
language or sexual encounters but the themes of street life are 
nonetheless unvarnished 
it is a truly exceptional film

crusoe virgin vision vhsbeta 8995 rated pg13 
 
crusoe based on the tale of a shipwreck on a tropical 
island is a lush and aesthetically pleasing movie and as ripe 
with moral dilemmas as the burdened coconut trees swaying on the 
beach 
in crusoe values come crashing down and savagely splinter 
the beliefs of the movies star aidan quinn 
quinn plays a greedy young 19thcentury slave trader who tempts 
fate by taking one final and risky expedition to round up more 
blacks from africa but his ship becomes ensnared in a vicious 
autumn storm and all aboard perish except for quinn who winds up 
sprawled on a desolate beach 
crusoe learns to endure the solitude and fashions a comfortable 
shelter for himself on the picturesque island 
before long his isolation is interrupted by visiting natives he 
rescues one from a human sacrifice and decides to keep him as a 
slave but the native later escapes and is killed 
in a provocative twist crusoe becomes the hunted and is trapped 
by another islander but the two men reach an accord and build 
something of a friendship 
the films ending is the final test of crusoes new respect for 
the man he once wanted to enslave 
director caleb deschanel so effectively captures the panoramic 
beauty of the island setting with its creamy white sand beaches 
dense verdant forests and crystal blue tide pools one can almost 
taste the salt spray in the breeze 
there also is very little dialogue but the engrossing visuals 
and the moral struggles make for compelling viewing

when peter falk filmed scenes for his new 
movie cookie at sing sing it marked a sentimental return 
not that he was ever a guest at the legendary slammer he grew 
up in ossining ny 
yeah i remember sing sing he reflected as a kid i used 
to go into the prison because the towns basketball team played the 
prisoners a lot of the kids i went to school with their fathers 
were guards there 
whenever you mentioned to people that you came from ossining 
they always had the same question do the lights go out when they 
electrocute somebody of course the lights never dimmed you were 
not aware of the prison as an ominous thing 
the major memory about sing sing had to do with the one big 
escape when i was in high school three guys broke out and went 
down to the river by the railroad station and got ahold of a boat 
one local cop was shot on the way down and one of the convicts was 
shot they actually rowed across the hudson and they were picked 
up on the palisades across the way that was a big thing 
in the new warner bros release cookie falk is mobster 
dino capino who is about to be sprung after 13 years in sing sing 
his teenage daughter played with amazing skill by english actress 
emily lloyd comes to visit him she is resentful since he hasnt 
married her mother dianne wiest he already has a wife brenda 
vaccaro as you might guess cookie is not the godfather 
iii 
after his long service as tvs slovenly gumshoe columbo falk 
is on the other side of the law thats were he started in movies 
it was nice being a mob guy again he remarked it was 
nice looking good too great suits they gave me did i look good 
i thought i did however he would brook no criticism of his 
columbo raincoat which is still in action after 18 years 
you know my first picture was murder incorporated in 1960 
i made a little splash in that he said i played abie reles 
who was part of that jewish mob that operated out of brooklyn at 
that time they were the first ones who hired themselves out to 
kill people they were all quite crazy abie was probably the 
craziest 
those mob guys when they saw that picture they went for it 
they liked me they came around and i spent some time with them i 
had a real interest in those guys i think everybody does 
i remember going around with some cops in new york they were 
mostly involved in drug cases but they also had some wire taps of 
mob guys i wanna tell ya if i had those tapes here and could play 
em for ya youd roll on the floor there are no funnier 
conversations i ever heard in my life 
peter falk may sound like a street guy but he has a bachelors 
degree in political science from the new school of social research 
in new york he was studying for his masters at syracuse 
university when he dropped out to try acting 
when i started out i was 2526 years old in offbroadway in 
new york he said like most actors i knew at that time we all 
wanted the same thing to be in the actors studio we thought that 
was heaven on earth 
i never thought about being in movies i never thought about 
being in television i just wanted to be a stage actor i remember 
this agent ive told the story before the guy said to me you 
know you wont be able to do tv or movies i dont know why but 
that didnt make any difference to me because i had never 
considered doing tv or movies 
i asked what he was talking about and he said your glass 
eye falk lost his eye when he was 3 he won an academy 
nomination for his supporting performance in murder 
incorporated and he has been working in films and television 
ever since 
falk won three emmy awards for his portrayal of lt columbo 
during its 19711977 run on nbc last season abc installed 
columbo as part of its abc mystery movie much to falks 
delight the show has been renewed for 198990 and he hopes to 
play the role for years to come 
ill play him as long as the people want to see him he 
said i think it would terrific to grow old as columbo if 
columbo really cant hear chuckling and columbo really cant 
see more chuckles and he gets to the point where it takes him 
an hour to get into the office i think that would be hilarious 
id like to see him saying whats my name laughing did

the floating world cynthia kadohatas first 
novel is best read on a window seat of a greyhound bus names and 
places speed by friendships form quickly departures come with 
little warning 
through olivia the books young narrator kadohata evokes a 
life of gas stations and motels wrecked cars and parttime jobs a 
world where a marriage of 10 years is treated with disbelief and 
some disdain where no place is like home 
sometimes when im on a greyhound bus i think this is where i 
belong the author explained ive never spent a year somewhere 
and said this is it i havent really got off that bus but id 
like to 
as a child kadohata was shocked to learn that her classmates 
had assigned bedtimes there were few rules in her house little 
routine at all 
she was born in chicago but soon lived in arkansas and georgia 
by age nine her parents were divorced and she had returned to 
chicago with her mother sister and brother kadohata now lives in 
manhattan but feels restless suspicious of setting down roots 
the floating world 1795 viking is not autobiographical 
kadohata insists despite the books story of olivias experiences 
as she moves across the country during the 1950s and 60s what 
the floating world does capture however is the feelings 
brought on by constant upheaval 
even today i sometimes feel i dont know where i belong the 
author said too bad a lot of times i would like having a 
feeling of belonging but i like traveling too 
she writes from the perspective of a secondgeneration 
japaneseamerican whose father was interned in prison camp during 
world war ii and who learned quickly how fragile the allegiances 
of family and neighborhood could be 
it was really upsetting she said of her fathers 
experience the thing is that i know it will never happen to me 
yet because it happened to my father im less sure of my place in 
the world 
kadohata first wanted to be a journalist but a few years after 
graduating from college she began writing short stories shes been 
published in the new yorker grand street and the pennsylvania 
review 
with fiction you can change the facts to reveal a larger 
truth thats the root of fiction thats the problem i have with 
nonfiction i would be so tempted to tell a lie because it would 
tell the story better thats what makes nonfiction so great too 
all the tension 
at the start of world war ii when japan was the united states 
bitter enemy olivias grandparents are forced to give their 
children american names such as roger lily laura ann the 
tradition is passed on to olivia and her siblings ben walker and 
peter 
when i read on the cover of time magazine are the japanese 
being unfair i kind of think people are going to be mad at me 
kadohata said 
i do have that sort of identification its hard because i 
look japanese whereas somebody whose parents came over from italy 
no one would think of ascociating him that closely with italy 
kadohatas infuences however are profoundly american she 
draws on the southern writer william faulkners feelings of 
restlessness and chaos and uses the spare language of raymond 
carver and bobbie ann mason 
and like faulkner she is fascinated with the blurring of myth 
and reality as olivia rides through oklahoma a hitchhiker appears 
and quickly vanishes kadohata also writes of an encounter between 
olivia and a friend of her stepfathers 
see my house he said its an illusion its not really 
there 
i looked at the house surrounded by dark and trees and below 
an orangeringed moon it did not seem quite real thats what i 
thought he meant 
the author explained i wanted some things to be fantastical 
thats a lot like me i daydream a lot its kind of like the 
saying about magic its true if you believe it and its not true 
if you dont believe it 
after olivia the narrator of the floating world graduates 
from high school she moves to california which had a mythic hold 
on kadohata and many americans as the symbol of a better life 
when we first moved there she recalled we were in a 
truck with my mothers boyfriend and we had driven across country 
i looked at all these little houses and i was just heartbroken it 
wasnt what i expected i expected to think it was a promised 
land 
she first called the book seven moons wanting to use the 
phases of the moon to mark the passage of time 
i was going to put the moon in all over maybe its just 
continuity i just wanted to describe the moon she said 
thats why i love traveling taking the bus i like to look at 
the landscape

twentytwo years after they began 14 years 
after they broke off and 20 years after they played at woodstock 
ten years after is back together 
a chrysalis album about time will be released in august 
15 years after their last one and a sevenweek fall us tour is 
planned the quartet one of the major bands to emerge from the 
1960s blues revival in england known for its fast and furious 
blend of blues and mediumheavy rock has not mellowed out 
guitaristvocalist alvin lee has been performing while bassist 
leo lyons keyboardist chick churchill and drummer rick lee have 
stayed in music producing engineering and managing 
in an interview with alvin lee and lyons lee said that the band 
didnt so much split as wind down wed had some degree of 
success and wed all got nice houses and families there was a bit 
of pressure to stay at home 
he said that before ten years after split critics said i was 
a fast tasteless guitar player that was bothering me a bit i 
shouldnt have let it now i realize 
so he put together the sevenpiece in flight critics said it 
was wonderful and i was playing better than ever i missed the roar 
of the crowd and the loudness after a while that band wasnt 
capable of playing heavy rock i went back to playing from my blues 
and rock roots he formed ten years later for a year then alvin 
lee and company which played some ten years after favorites 
when we played together last summer suddenly it sounded like 
ten years after right from the first note it was obvious ten 
years after had its own sound lee said 
reception at the festivals was so enthusiastic lyons said that 
the four decided to stay together lee and lyons each working with 
other people wrote 40 songs the band recorded 15 unable to 
decide on 10 they put 11 on about time 
in july ten years after played before 80000 in east berlin 
asked about woodstock which took place 20 years ago on a farm 
in bethel ny on aug 15 16 and 17 lyons says its all a 
bit hazy now to be honest 
still memories come back 
we were set to go on and a thunderstorm appeared lee said 
nobody could play for two or three hours sparks were flying on 
the stage i thought it outdid the music by far gods light show 
in a way it was fortunate i went for a walk around the lake 
and joined in with the audience nobody knew i was one of the 
musicians half a million people cant all run under trees they 
sat there and started singing people were playing on mud slides 
it was a wonderful thing to see that happening everybody was 
making the best out of the ridiculous sitation i think it brought 
the best out of everybody 
people were offering food and drink it was very idealistic 
very nice i think had it not been for the storm probably i would 
never have seen much 
one of the reasons i went out was because in the backstage 
area there wasnt a single cigarette i came back with 10 marijuana 
cigarettes no regular cigarettes 
lyons said they said the food backstage was spiked with acid 
whether it was true or not it dims the appetite the drinks were 
supposed to be dodgy in those days you never used to drink from an 
open can anyhow 
neither can remember what ten years after played except for 
im going home the highenergy rocker used in the 
woodstock movie and they think the jazzy i cant keep from 
crying sometimes and love like a man 
i remember we did good morning little schoolgirl lyons 
said because the tuning went out because of atmospheric 
conditions we had to stop the song apologize and retune we did 
going home as an encore 
we were the first on after the storm lee recalled 
everybody was worried sparks were still flying off the stage and 
it was very wet somebody had to do it think how many of our 
records would have sold if wed been electrocuted 
it was definitely the movie that made woodstock the memorable 
thing it was lee said toronto was probably as good a festival 
as woodstock it got forgotten 
we carried on in 3000 to 5000seat halls a year later the 
movie came out and were into 20000 seaters 
the night before their woodstock appearance ten years after was 
in st louis at a jazz festival before a primarily black audience 
nina simone went on lyons said four white hippies went 
on afterwards when we walked on stage an uproar was starting it 
was frightening but we played a bit of jazz and blues and we were 
ok then 
lee sais that in one way woodstock was a statement against 
racial prejudice it was even more about the peace movement and 
the vietnam war we thought the peace movement was very real and a 
good thing to be doing woodstock tended to make it into a 
fashionable thing the fashion grew old and it was no longer cool 
to be a hippie 
lyons added woodstock was antiestablishment a peace and 
love thing antiviolence it was for tolerance let people do what 
they want help one another i think it had a lot of longterm 
benefits 
but they didnt know what woodstock symbolized before they got 
there lee said it was just another line on the sheet 
they flew from st louis to new york and drove until they came 
to blocked roads 
they took us in an army helicopter lee said i was 
hanging out on a safety strap over all the audience it was a 
mindblowing experience

eastman kodak co says its secondquarter 
profits fell 85 percent mainly the result of a 225 million 
restructuring charge that was announced last week 
without the special charges profits still would have dropped 26 
percent in the second quarter the company blames higher costs 
including interest expenses and the impact of the strong dollar 
chairman colby chandler vowed last week and again tuesday that 
strong steps would be taken to deal with the slump in operating 
profits 
nevertheless the stock fell tuesday it was off 62 cents at 
4750 in late trading on the new york stock exchange 
net earnings were 60 million or 18 cents a share down from a 
record 390 million or 120 a share a year earlier sales rose 
to a record 45 billion from 413 billion for the second quarter 
last year 
for the first half profit fell 60 percent to 260 million or 
80 cents a share from 650 million or 2 a share a year earlier 
sales rose to a record 84 billion from 746 billion in last 
years first half 
the onetime charges cover changes that have happened are 
happening and will be happening said company spokesman paul 
allen he said the changes could involve layoffs sale of 
businesses and discontinuation of products 
but the company has not released details about its specific 
plans 
thats what were waiting for theres been nothing concrete 
so far said eugene glazer stock analyst for dean witter 
reynolds in new york 
he said the company has already made it clear that the current 
restructuring is not going to be major by wall street proportions 
its going to be significant but not gigantic glazer said 
but that leaves the question of whether the company is going to 
tighten its belt by one notch two notches or three 
while volume gains so far this year have been gratifying 
especially in the united states our earnings have not kept pace 
chandler said 
some costcutting steps may be taken in the companys 
information systems business segment which includes copiers and 
microfilm and graphics equipment 
for the second quarter that segment posted a 144 million loss 
as compared to a 92 million secondquarter profit last year even 
without restructuring charges the segment would only have posted a 
profit of 6 million 
there seems to be tremendous pressure there for something to 
happen said glazer

booths under a marketing agreement with italys ing c olivetti amp 
co spa

drivers approaching a highway toll plaza will slow to about 40 
mph and insert their smart cards into transmitters mounted in the

authorities about selling systems in the united states but has 
nothing to announce yet

devices that allow cars to pay tolls without stopping but atampt

multiple purposes for example the same card could also store car 
maintenance records

that has been looking for ways to reduce the debt incurred in its 
record buyout deal says it has hired a financial adviser to help 
it decide what to do with its 20 percent stake in espn inc which 
operates a cable sports newtork 
capital citiesabc inc owns a controlling 80 percent interest 
in espn the nations largest cable network with 524 million 
subscribers 
rjr nabisco acquired for 245 billion in april by a group led 
by the buyout specialists kohlberg kravis roberts amp co said 
tuesday it had retained lazard freres amp co to advise it on the 
espn stake 
we have had several inquiries from parties interested in 
acquiring our stake in espn louis v gerstner jr chairman and 
chief executive of rjr nabisco said in a statement however we 
have not decided whether we will sell our stake lazard will help 
us evaluate our alternatives 
rjr nabisco is looking for ways to raise cash through asset 
sales in an effort to reduce the huge debt incurred in the buyout 
it has said it intends to sell about 55 billion in assets to 
reduce debt and has announced about 26 billion of such 
transactions mostly the sale of five nabisco food companies in 
europe 
nabisco brands inc an rjr subsidiary acquired the espn stake 
for 60 million in 1984 from abc video enterprises at the time 
nabisco brands was beginning to become heavily involved in sports 
marketing 
rjrs new management has indicated it is reviewing the companys 
marketing efforts and is likely to reduce its involvement in sports 
marketing 
some industry analysts questioned whether the espn stake would 
have any significant value to anyone other than capital cities 
because the giant media concern will control espn no matter who 
owns the minority stake 
rjr spokesman david kalish said capital citiesabc has the right 
to match any bona fide offer that might be made for the espn stake 
held by rjr 
capital citiesabc said it had no comment on rjrs statement

september 1979 abc video acquired a 15 percent stake in espn in

the house has voted to increase the national 
debt limit temporarily by 70 billion so the treasury wont go into 
default while congress is on its summer recess 
the bill approved 231185 tuesday and sent to the senate adds 
to the debt ceiling of 28 trillion only through oct 31 by then 
congress hopes to complete work on bill boosting the treasurys 
permanent borrowing authority to more than 31 trillion 
the treasury is already bumping up against the 28 trillion 
limit and would be unable to meet its obligations by midaugust 
without additional power to issue debt a us government default 
would be unprecedented 
the house passed the shortterm debt extension after blocking 
228193 an attempt by rep william dannemeyer rcalif to make 
the increase contingent upon house consideration of an amendment to 
the constitution requiring a balanced budget 
the house actually approved the permanent debt increase when it 
passed the fiscal 1990 budget last spring but the legislation has 
been held up in the senate 
several senators plan to use the mustpass legislation to carry 
amendments addressing pet priorities and it could also become the 
vehicle for a new deficitreduction effort by congressional leaders 
and the white house 
the national debt has tripled since the beginning of the decade 
due to the huge budget deficits of the reagan administration the 
treasury has been forced to borrow more and more money to finance 
government spending that exceeds tax receipts 
the annual deficits have gone down from their peak of over 200 
billion a year but nearly 150 billion in red ink will be added to 
the pool this fiscal year 
the grammrudman budget law itself passed as part of a 1985 
debt bill that first put the limit above 2 trillion mandates that 
congress and the president reduce the deficit in fiscal 1990 to 
100 billion 
fiscal 1990 begins oct 1 congress commences its fourweek 
summer recess this saturday 
the shortterm debt limit bill approved by the house on tuesday 
also included a provision requested by the treasury to change the 
way the government accounts for its zerocoupon bonds when 
calculating the debt the change will lessen the immediate impact 
the bonds have on the debt

toyota motor corp the conservative giant of 
japanese industry says it plans to drop special courtesy titles 
for employees and cut in half the number of approvals required for 
most decisions 
the steps are part of a broad plan to make toyota more flexible 
and provide every employee the opportunity to work creatively and 
to the fullest of his or her ability the company announced 
tuesday 
toyota also said it will spend 730 million on bettering 
employees work lives through new recreational facilities dining 
rooms and company housing for both married and single employees 
aspects of toyotas plan such as more company housing are 
strictly japanese but the emphasis on employee creativity is 
western 
while american companies are trying to be more japanese in 
management the japanese are trying in some respects to become more 
american 
this is in order to have quick decisions and get more ideas 
more energetic work from the staff said akikazu kida a toyota 
spokesman in new york the changes were also announced in tokyo 
to promote workplace democracy old titles such as kacho 
manager will be discarded and all employees will be referred to 
simply as san the japanese equivalent of mr mrs or ms 
personnel evaluations that have been dominated by seniority will 
now take performance more into account toyota said about 1000 
supervisors will be reassigned to creative handson work 
toyota is the largest industrial company in japan and has a 
reputation for a slow conservative management style in contrast 
to more westernstyle companies such as honda motor co ltd 
japanese companies have long succeeded by adapting american 
technology and perfecting manufacturing techniques but corporate 
leaders have decided that success in the future will demand 
innovation and innovation requires giving employees freer rein 
american consultants have traveled to japan to lecture the 
industrial giants on such themes as how one person can make a 
difference 
employees will be encouraged to realize their own potential 
and pursue their own professional interests toyota said

in this area said gerard lynch a criminal law professor at 
columbia university i would have expected it would be used more 
anyway and this verdict encourages it 
the us district court trial of five executives of the defunct 
investment firm princetonnewport partners lp and a former drexel 
burnham lambert inc trader was the first time the statute was used 
in a securities case 
opponents of the law say applies far too stiff penalties for 
whitecollar criminals including a 20year jail term per count 
they also say its provision for pretrial asset seizures can force 
companies out of business before a trial 
i think rico as originally promulgated by congress was 
excellent i think it has become grossly overused and abused 
said securities lawyer aubrey b harwell jr who represented a 
former drexel trader in another case stemming from the governments 
threeyear crackdown on wall street crime 
former manhattan us attorney rudolph giuliani now running for 
new york city mayor pioneered the new use of rico and critics 
say threats to use it 
giuliani was accused of trying to pressure the princetonnewport 
defendants to testify against others by charging them with 
racketeering princetonnewport has said the charges last august 
forced its liquidation shortly thereafter 
drexel chief executive frederick h joseph has said his firm 
agreed in a separate case to pay 650 million and plead guilty to 
six securities felonies rather than face a possible rico indictment 
michael milken the former head of drexels junk bond 
operations was indicted on 98 counts of racketeering and fraud 
earlier this year for transactions that included one also cited in 
the princetonnewport complaint after refusing to enter a plea 
agreement 
a person familiar with his legal preparations said tuesday the 
princetonnewport verdict would not affect milkens plans to fight 
the charges 
but legal experts said mondays guilty verdict would give 
prosecutors a psychological boost as they ready for milkens 
scheduled march 1990 trial it also could spur more rico securities 
cases 
it certainly would indicate the department of justice the 
viability of rico at least before a jury and in a case where tax 
seemed to be the overriding concern said columbia securities law 
professor harvey goldschmid 
justice department guidelines on rico state the law should not 
be used as a substitute for tax fraud prosecutions but the 
guidelines are flexible and in the princetonnewport case tax 
claims were brought instead as mail fraud charges 
new york attorney martin klein a close friend of milkens 
argues that the statute should not be used simply to fit the needs 
of prosecutors 
its not a substitute for the securities laws or the tax laws 
and its not to be used as a catchall for every other federal 
statute he said 
nevertheless proponents of the law say its broad nature and the 
changing nature of crime in which such frauds as insider trading 
have become more common have made rico a logical tool to fight any 
pattern of criminal activity 
if the rico statute can be used for three bookmakers standing 
on the corner it certainly ought to be used for individuals sitting 
in corporate boardrooms stealing massive amounts of money from the 
public said ronald goldstock director of the new york state 
organized crime task force 
congress is considering two bills that would revamp ricos use 
in civil cases eliminating its award of triple damages supreme 
court chief justice william rehnquist in may called for imposing 
limitations on civil use of rico 
others said ricos severe potential penalties were inappropriate 
for cases such as princetonnewport the jury lawyers said may 
have convicted the defendants of arranging illegal tax schemes with 
or without the rico charge 
my own view is that its got to be an extremely aggravated 
whitecollar case to use the rico statute said criminal defense 
lawyer robert morvillo i dont think it was originally designed 
for this use i think its very heavyhanded

every morning traffic moves at a crawl along 
route 128 the high technology highway ringing boston some 
insiders say the pace of business inside the sleek corporate 
headquarters along 128 isnt any faster 
tactical decisions that take six weeks in boston can take 
anywhere from six days to six nanoseconds in california said 
sterling hager founder of a public relations firm that represents 
computer firms on both coasts 
after a year of falling profits and employment many companies 
along route 128 are going through a period of painful retrenchment 
and selfexamination and a common conclusion is that they need to 
become more agile less hierarchical and more willing to take risks 
in the last week three of the four largest computer makers in 
massachusetts wang laboratories inc data general corp and 
prime computer inc announced quarterly losses 
primes troubles have made it a takeover target and two other 
massachusetts hightech companies cullinet software inc and 
apollo computer inc already have been sold this year another 
former high flyer leading edge products inc is in bankruptcy 
all told high technology manufacturing companies in 
massachusetts have eliminated 7300 jobs in the past year and 
36100 since their peak in december 1984 the state department of 
employment and training says 
underlying route 128s woes are the maturing of the computer 
industry the slowdown in the national economy and the stiff 
competition that minicomputer makers face from workstations and 
ever more powerful personal computers 
but those trends do not entirely explain why some massachusetts 
computer firms are still prospering or why route 128s west coast 
counterpart californias silicon valley is generally healthy 
the substance of route 128s problem critics charge is style 
bostonarea executives in their buttondown shirts and brown shoes 
are more cautious and slowmoving than their california rivals in 
polo shirts and reeboks 
in northern california companies the hierarchy seems 
compressed said hager an account executive in sunnyvale might 
be reporting directly to the president the ceo or the founder in 
cambridge that person will speak to the communications manager 
who works for the vp of younameit who reports to the executive 
vp who whispers to the main force 
in part hager said the different management styles reflect 
cultural or lifestyle differences in part they are a matter of 
age 
the hightech superstructure on the west coast is run and 
managed by people in their 30s and the people who run the 
hightech companies on the east coast are mainly in their 50s and 
60s he said people in their 20s and 30s have no fear of 
anything 
stephen l josselyn a computer market analyst with 
international data corp in framingham agrees that decisionmaking 
is slower and product cycles longer along route 128 its just 
harder to get people to move on the east coast he said 
examples abound 
wang which pioneered the market for word processors lost 
ground when it failed to move quickly into personal computers it 
is now making a big push into document imaging products but it 
announced a 375 million quarterly loss monday some analysts say 
the familycontrolled company may have to find a substantial 
outside investor 
digital equipment corp the states largest computer maker 
also stuck with proprietary operating systems and failed to 
capitalize on the pc explosion now it is moving into open or 
nonproprietary software but digitals earnings have slipped this 
year and it has frozen salaries 
data general also is moving away from proprietary systems 
toward open software and reduced instruction set computing or 
risc technology which simplifies the circuitry of a computer 
and allows cost savings in a twoyear restructuring it has cut 
its work force from 16000 to 14000 and posted a 231 million 
loss for the quarter ended june 24 
data general spokesman michael f klatman calls the critics 
charges baloney 
from the time management made the decision to commit to open 
systems it took us just nine months to get our first products out 
the door he said thats something you never would have seen 
in this industry 10 years ago 
klatman and others point out that aside from sales of pcs and 
workstations the entire us computer market is slow 
minicomputer makers have been hit particularly hard squeezed 
between minisupercomputers on the high end and technical 
workstations on the low end said douglas j crook an analyst with 
dataquest inc in san jose calif 
it just so happens its an accident of nature that there are 
more minicomputer makers based in massachusetts and the 
traditional minicomputer is not growing at the rate of other 
areas said klatman

the jury that convicted five former officials of 
princetonnewport partners lp and a former drexel burnham lambert 
inc trader of racketeering charges now must decide how much money 
they will have to forfeit to the government 
the jurors began deliberations on the forfeiture issue tuesday 
after hearing arguments from both sides 
assistant us attorney mark hansen said the defendants should 
relinquish salaries and other claims that could total more than 21 
million 
defense attorneys who have said they will appeal the 
conviction argued that the forfeiture sought by the government was 
excessive and violated the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual 
punishment 
on monday the manhattan federal court jury convicted the 
defendants of racketeering racketeering conspiracy conspiracy and 
numerous counts of mail and wire fraud 
the case marked the first time securities professionals were 
accused of racketeering under a controversial federal law aimed at 
combating mobsters and drug pushers the racketeer influenced and 
corrupt organizations law provides for heavy fines and lengthy 
prison terms in addition to forfeiture 
the trial received widespread attention because it grew 
indirectly out of the ivan boesky insider trading scandal that 
rocked wall street three years ago 
the largest forfeiture was sought from former princetonnewport 
partner james sutton regan his partnership interest was placed at 
133 million and his salary at 175 million 
from former drexel trader bruce lee newberg the government 
sought 25 million in salary 
the prosecution asked the jury to require forfeiture for the 
other princetonnewport defendants as follows former partner 
charles m zarzecki 11 million partnership interest and 267483 
in salary former partner jack z rabinowitz 791191 partnership 
interest and 454507 in salary former partner paul a berkman 
762613 partnership interest and 558328 in salary and former 
controller steven b smotrich 124583 in salary 
heres a man who has no money and the government wants him to 
forfeit millions and millions of dollars said regans attorney 
theodore wells i submit to you that is cruel and unusual 
punishment 
but hansen told the jury that the racketeering statute permitted 
the forfeiture of all interest from an illegal enterprise 
as they chased the almighty dollar they crossed far past the 
line of law hansen said you must decide whether the 
defendants should be stripped of some of their tainted wealth 
the case involved a series of prearranged stock transactions 
from 1984 to 1986 the government alleged during the fiveweek 
trial that the defendants illegally bought and sold stocks to 
generate phony tax losses 
princetonnewport went out of business after the indictment was 
brought last august defense lawyers said at the time that the 
charges alone though unproven destroyed the securities firms 
ability to do business 
besides forfeiture the defendants face up to 20 years in prison 
on each of the two racketeering counts jail terms ranging from 
five to three years for the other charges and fines a sentencing 
date has not been scheduled 
before the lawyers presented their arguments to the jury us 
district judge robert carter ruled that the prosecution could not 
tell the jury about a 650 million fine drexel paid to settle 
securities law charges in another case which also stemmed from the 
boesky scandal 
defense attorneys had argued that telling jurors about the fine 
would prejudice them on the forfeiture question

us families are losing at least 607 million 
a year because the government hasnt passed legislation 
guaranteeing workers unpaid leave to care for young children or 
sick parents a group backing such a law said today 
year after year american families are the big losers because 
congress has failed to pass minimum family and medical leave 
policies donna lenhoff of the womens legal defense fund said in 
prepared remarks working parents should not have to choose 
between having a job and having a family 
legislation is awaiting debate on both the house and senate 
floors that would require employers to provide up to 10 weeks of 
unpaid leave over a twoyear period to meet family needs during the 
birth or adoption of a child and for family medical emergencies 
unnecessary losses the report for the family and medical 
leave act coalition was based on a 1988 survey of 7000 families 
conducted by the institute for social research at the university of 
michigan 
the institute compiles data on a broad range of topics annually 
and it is then used by researchers who break out and interpret 
areas of particular interest to them 
the analysis said the 607 million in family losses represents 
the additional earnings lost by new mothers who return to work but 
are unable to return to their former jobs because their employers 
dont have parental leave policies in place 
when these new mothers without jobprotected leaves return to 
work but are unable to return to their former jobs they experience 
more unemployment and lower wages than those mothers who return 
after a period of protected leave the report said 
moreover the report said taxpayers spend 108 million a year 
on government assistance programs that wouldnt be necessary if 
there was a nationwide family and medical leave program 
working mothers without jobprotected leave receive 108 
million more in assistance from such programs as unemployment 
insurance supplemental security income and welfare than do mothers 
working for employers with parental leave policies the report 
said 
as congress prepares to leave for their summer break we 
wanted to remind our nations lawmakers that american families are 
suffering unnecessary losses due to their inaction on family 
policies lenhoff said

eastern airlines has boosted its daily flights to 
350 as part of a plan to emerge from a crippling strike as a leaner 
carrier but unionized pilots say the only thing that has increased 
is the danger level 
the expansion which began on tuesday represents an increase of 
nearly 60 percent over last months schedule eastern is now back 
to about a third of its prestrike size 
its another major step back from the impact of the strike and 
the bankruptcy and a very significant phase in the rebuilding of 
the airline said eastern spokesman robin matell 
but union officials called the schedule expansion an unsafe rush 
to return with inexperienced flight crews 
the air line pilots association issued a statement saying if 
you get past all of the hype and all of the slogans there is a 
level of risk to the flying public never before experienced in the 
history of american commercial aviation 
alpa said 75 percent of easterns flight crews are unfamiliar 
with the type of aircraft they are flying and that eastern is 
violating federal standards by pairing inexperienced pilots 
we are in complete and total compliance with all federal 
aviation administration rules easterns matell countered our 
training and procedures are guided by conservatism is all 
respects 
matell added the unions have repeatedly used safety scares and 
smear tactics in an effort to hurt eastern 
faa spokesman jack barker said eastern is meeting the 
recommendation if there is anything to the contrary we would like 
to know about it 
eastern said the inreased flights went off smoothly except for 
one new yorktomontreal flight canceled because a catering truck 
damaged a plane 
also some passengers in the atlanta hub where many of the new 
flights were added complained about long delays 
this is my first time on eastern in two years first and 
last said passenger david parker who complained that his flight 
from charlotte nc arrived about an hour late my travel agent 
talked me into this for the 39 fare 
to entice more passengers eastern offered temporary oneway 
fares as low as 39 it also was required to lease several planes 
from its sister carrier continental airlines 
unable to maintain its prestrike schedule of nearly 1100 daily 
flights when the strike began march 4 eastern filed for chapter 11 
bankruptcy protection five days later 
last month the company filed a reorganization plan calling for 
eastern to emerge from bankruptcy by years end at twothirds its 
previous size the airlines unions back an alternative buyout 
proposal by chicago commodities trader joseph ritchie 
eastern said it plans to increase its daily flights to 390 by 
aug 15 its goal is 800 daily flights from 77 cities down from 
102 cities before the strike 
eastern and continental are owned by texas air corp the unions 
contend texas air wants either to liquidate eastern or merge it 
with predominantly nonunion continental

general electric co plc and siemens ag reached an 
agreement with the british government on conditions for resuming 
their joint bid for plessey co plc the government said wednesday 
the british and german electronics giants have pledged to remedy 
public interest questions identified by the monopolies and mergers 
commission the department of trade and industry said in a brief 
statement 
the department in april said gec and siemens could renew their 
bid for plessey also a british electronics company on the 
recommendation of the monopolies commission 
but the clearance was conditioned upon the companies negotiating 
with the department and the ministry of defense to ensure there is 
no reduction in competition in the british defense electronics 
industry 
details of the agreement werent immediately available but a 
department spokesman said there were no differences of 
substance between the measures agreed to by gec and siemens and 
the recommendations made in the commissions april report 
among the commissions chief objections to the original 
structure of the plessey takeover was an accompanying plan for gec 
to acquire a 35 percent stake in siemens defense interests the 
commission said it opposed such a stake on the ground it would give 
gec an interest in the plessey radar and military communications 
interests to be acquired by siemens 
the original gecsiemens offer made earlier this year valuing 
plessey at 28 billion automatically lapsed when the monopolies 
commission launched its inquiry in january 
a spokesman for gec refused to say whether the two companies 
would renew their bid we are considering with our partners on 
the next step said the spokesman who wasnt identified in 
accordance with british custom 
under british takeover regulations gec and siemens have 21 days 
in which to reintroduce their bid 
a plessey spokesman couldnt be reached for comment 
gec is not related to the similarly named american company

john sculley and bill gates putting 
aside for the moment the legal battle between apple computer inc 
and microsoft corp dined peacefully together this week and 
announced an office on a disc for the apple macintosh 
gates chairman of microsoft quipped that the legal 
departments arent friends but he noted that the two companies 
remain steadfast allies and share the same vision of the future of 
computing 
sculley apples chairman said his appearance at the microsoft 
presentation on tuesday shows that we want to be partners 
together in innovation despite apples ongoing copyright suit 
against microsoft and hewlettpackard co 
apple and microsoft are working together more now than at any 
time in the past gates said we have decided not to let the 
lawsuit affect the other things were doing and let it run its own 
course 
microsoft of redmond wash recently won a round in the 
courtroom fight when a federal judge issued a tentative ruling that 
would substantially narrow cupertino califbased apples suit 
accusing microsoft and hewlettpackard of stealing the look and 
feel of the macintosh system 
microsoft has always been very clear that we dont understand 
why apple brought the lawsuit and that we expect to win the 
lawsuit gates said i think the recent developments are 
consistent with our predictions the case is not over but it was 
a very positive milestone 
the office on a disc for the apple macintosh consists of a 
compact disc containing four of microsofts most popular business 
programs for the macintosh microsoft word excel powerpoint and 
mail plus documentation for each a thesaurus and other items 
both companies hope the product will help spur the evolution 
from floppy diskettes to compact disks for computers 
the microsoft office collection on disk will be priced at 949 
and is expected to be available by the end of september that is a 
onethird discount from what the programs would cost if bought 
separately on floppy diskettes 
sales of apples compact disc drive which retails for about 
1200 have been slow so far as businesses await more software for 
it 
this is just an introductory technology i dont expect it to 
have a major financial impact said analyst david bayer of 
montgomery securities in san francisco its more a demonstration 
of capabilities laying the groundwork for future uses

heavy crowds and unexpectedly long waiting 
lines will soon force walt disney world to double the size of the 
entertainment portion of its new disneymgm studios theme park 
company chairman michael eisner says 
the demand for it has been even greater than our wildest 
hopes eisner said we do not want the lines to be that long 
we are trying to rectify it as soon as we can 
specific plans for the expansion to be carried out in three 
years will be announced in six weeks eisner told the orlando 
sentinel in a story published tuesday 
the 500 million 135acre central florida complex has two 
sections the themed area which is the site of most of the major 
attractions and the film production portion where visitors ride 
trams and walk through a backstage tour 
eisner said the studio park needs to be bigger and it needs 
to be on the scale of the other two parks known as the magic 
kingdom and epcot center 
the magic kingdoms estimated capacity is 45000 and epcots 
about 60000 the studio theme park can handle about half the 
crowds of the magic kingdom 
because many of its attractions now are geared toward adults 
the studio expansion would add more attractions for younger 
children and introduce more traditional disney characters eisner 
said 
it also would introduce a nighttime extravaganza like the 
fireworks show at the magic kingdom and a laser light show at epcot 
plus a themed land attraction such as fantasyland and 
tomorrowland now at the magic kingdom 
eisner would not say how much the new construction would cost 
mca inc which operates universal studios hollywood plans to 
open the theme park portion of its new universal studios florida to 
tourists in the orlando area this coming spring 
its working studio which began movie and television production 
last fall is billed as the nations largest outside hollywood the 
studioandtour complex is built on a 440acre site more than 
three times as big as disneys 
jay stein president of mca recreation services group has taken 
issue with eisners remarks that disneys park is a new concept 
a new idea 
mca officials contend that disney copied the idea 
we strongly believe that not only the idea to do a studio 
tour but much of the specific content of the disney attraction 
originated with universal studios which has been operating a 
studio tour in los angeles since 1964 stein said in an interview 
after disneys studio park opened last may

sales of new homes propelled by falling 
mortgage rates rose 55 percent in june the third consecutive 
monthly increase the government reported today 
the commerce department said sales of new singlefamily homes 
rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 670000 units in june 
as the housing industry continued to rebound from a sluggish period 
earlier in the year when sales fell to their lowest level since the 
198182 recession 
mortgage rates fell further in july causing many economists to 
look for a climb in home sales and construction in the months 
ahead in fact many economists believe that a significant rebound 
in housing is needed to keep the country out of a recession 
in a second report showing a slight rebound the commerce 
department said orders for manufactured goods edged up 04 percent 
in june following a steep 26 percent drop in may 
fixed mortgage rates dipped last week to 981 percent their 
lowest point since april 1987 fixedrate mortgages peaked in march 
at 1122 percent the same month that housing starts fell to an 
annual rate of 555000 units their most sluggish pace since 
december 1982 
the 55 percent rise in new home sales in june followed a 43 
percent may advance and a 97 percent rise in april altogether 
the three months of increases have driven home sales 207 percent 
above their march low 
the increase in sales has come despite the fact that home prices 
are up sharply the median price of a new home jumped 83 percent 
in june to 129900 this designates the level where half the homes 
in the country sold for more and half sold for less 
the average price of a new home rose as well climbing 84 
percent to 159100 housing analysts have blamed the increase on 
the fact that much of the market is now composed of the moveup 
buyer who can afford a more expensive home firsttime buyers have 
been frozen out so far by the jump in mortgage rates 
the june increase in sales was powered by a 234 percent jump in 
sales in the west which climbed to an annual rate of 232000 units 
sales in the midwest were up as well but by a smaller 31 
percent to an annual rate of 99000 units sales in the south edged 
up 19 percent to a rate of 267000 units 
the increases were enough to offset a giant 182 percent drop in 
new home sales in the northeast whcih fell to an annual rate of 
72000 units

badly divided house democrats took their fight 
over a capitalgains tax cut behind closed doors today and 
apparently agreed only that opposition should not be a litmus test 
of party loyalty 
speaker thomas s foley dwash said the caucus indicated to 
him that most democrats oppose a major cut in capitalgains tax 
rates as is favored by president bush and a majority of the house 
ways and means committee 
i believe that is bad tax policy bad fiscal policy unwise 
inequitable and illtimed foley said but he added there has 
been no talk of retaliating against democrats who side with bush on 
the issue 
we dont have a guillotine around here foley said 
rep ed jenkins dga a ways and means member who is chief 
sponsor of the proposed rate cut said he has enough votes in 
committee and in the house to pass the plan cutting the tax on 
profits realized from investments in securities or property 
rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the committee said 
i think theres a hopeful atmosphere of some kind of 
compromise perhaps along lines of a new plan that he outlined 
tuesday 
his proposal would protect investors from having to pay taxes on 
gains caused by inflation but he declined to provide other 
details he has said he could not support a reduction in the 
capitalgains tax rate 
rostenkowski said he planned to present the idea later today to 
the 13 republican members of his committee who have joined six 
democrats to produce a majority in favor of a rate cut 
a republican committee member who spoke on condition that he 
not be identified by name said there was no chance rostenkowski 
can persuade republicans to drop their support of a rate cut an 
idea already rejected by the white house 
however the first task facing rostenkowski is to win back at 
least one of the six democrats if he does that hell have an 
1818 tie in the committee and wont have to face the caucus in 
the somewhat embarrassing position of being in a minority on his 
own committee 
one of the six democrats rep beryl anthony of arkansas called 
the proposal creative and said it probably could have drawn 
wide support if it had been presented earlier 
its a pretty sound concept but six of us are still committed 
to mr jenkins proposal anthony said 
anthony referred to another of the six rep ed jenkins dga 
chief sponsor of a plan to cut the top capital gains tax rate to 
196 percent for two years and then raise it to 28 percent and 
exclude gains caused by inflation 
the top rate is identical with the top federal income tax rate 
on other income 28 percent or for certain upperincome 
taxpayers 33 percent 
bush has not formally endorsed jenkins plan but administration 
officials have said there was a lot in it they could support 
bushs proposal would set a top rate of 15 percent but it would 
not apply to timber or commercial buildings 
anthony said rostenkowskis plan would exempt gains caused by 
inflation from taxation but neither he nor rostenkowski would give 
further details 
the change would apply to profits from assets sold after dec 
31 1989 
capital gains are increased values of any asset stocks homes 
farms stamp collections or almost anything that has value 
all parties agree that a lower capital gains tax rate increases 
government revenue in the first year or so it is in effect as 
investors take advantage of the rate reduction to get rid of 
investments they no longer find of top appeal 
the democratic leadership of the house including rostenkowski 
has opposed a rate reduction on the grounds that most of the 
benefits would go to taxpayers making more than 100000 a year 
supporters have argued that denial of rate cuts on those grounds is 
nonsensical because it hurts the economy and stifles jobcreating 
new investments 
the other four democrats targeted by rostenkowski are andy 
jacobs of indiana ronnie flippo of alabama and jj pickle and 
mike andrews both of texas

avon products inc today said investor irwin l 
jacobs who holds a stake in avon stock has proposed a possible 
acquisition of the cosmetics company for 41 a share or nearly 3 
billion 
avon said it received a letter from jacobs late tuesday 
requesting a meeting to negotiate the deal 
james e preston avons chairman and chief executive officer 
said jacobs letter would be discussed at the boards regular 
meeting on thursday in a brief statement preston said he has sent 
a letter to jacobs informing him that the avon board repeatedly has 
said the company is not for sale 
earlier this year the avon board rejected a 39ashare 
takeover offer from rival direct selling company amway corp and 
indicated at the time that it would resist future acquisition 
attempts amway withdrew its bid of about 21 billion but 
continues to hold roughly 103 percent of avons common stock 
outstanding in a partnership with jacobs 
the aj partnership as the alliance of amway and jacobs is 
called did not act jointly in making the initial bid for avon nor 
are they acting together now 
jacobs said in a telephone interview today that amway was not 
participating in his offer for avon in any way 
if jacobs prevails in his takeover attempt he said he plans to 
sell avons retail division which consists of some the countrys 
bestselling perfumes sold at department store counters including 
giorgio beverly hills and red 
the direct selling operations of new yorkbased avon in the 
united states and abroad would be retained jacobs said 
he said he has no intention of selling any piece of avon to 
amway or to mary kay corp the parent of direct seller mary kay 
cosmetics inc which also has previously expressed interest in 
avon 
jacobs who runs his investment operations from minneapolis 
also said he has submitted a filing to the securities and exchange 
commission in which he said he has hired an investment banking 
division of citicorp to arrange financing for the allcash bid 
he said he has not had any contact with avon executives except a 
telephone call to acknowledge receipt of his letter 
jacobs 41ashare offer for avon is worth about 225 billion 
based on 5491 million shares of common stock outstanding jacobs 
also said in the sec filing that he contemplates redeeming avons 
preferred shares which would cost 3350 per share or a total of 
about 603 million 
avon also has about 1 billion in debt that would be part of any 
acquisition

boeing co halfway through another record year 
today opened contract talks with union leaders who say they want a 
wage hike this time instead of the productivity bonuses of the past 
six years 
negotiations began in wichita kan between boeing and three 
districts of the machinists union which represent 57800 workers 
in seattle portland ore and wichita 
representing the union are district 751 president tom baker of 
seattle ron eldridge of wichitas district 70 and george miller of 
portlands district 24 
aerospace industry analysts say the union is in a strong 
position to exact a favorable settlement because of a 67 billion 
backlog of commercial airplane orders 346 million in profits in 
the first half of 1989 and a shortage of skilled workers that 
forced boeing to borrow lockheed corp workers earlier this year 
union officials say they want an hourly wage increase likely to 
be in the doubledigits to replace onceayear productivity 
bonuses boeing has given the past six years 
boeing customers have been irritated by deliver delays for 
747400 model jets with 44 due for delivery in the last quarter a 
work stoppage would jeopardize boeings reputation for reliability 
the company borrowed about 600 lockheed workers earlier this 
year as it rescheduled delivery dates for the 747400 and union 
officials say those workers should be leaving boeing this month 
i think they will get a wage increase i dont think push 
is going to come to shove here said gary reich aerospace 
analyst at shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
the chance of a strike is small say analysts who believe 
boeing workers know they are better off riding the crest of record 
airplane orders than sitting out the good times on a picket line 
i would not anticipate a prolonged labor disruption or 
strike said william deatherage aerospace analyst at dean witter 
reynolds inc in new york 
not many people at boeing are not aware of the cyclical nature 
of the business this is the opportunity of a lifetime for 
workers to get all the overtime they can he said 
other union contract requests will cover overtime rules an 
improved costofliving index better pension payments onsite 
education programs and child care union officers said wages will 
be the last item discussed 
boeing led by chief negotiator larry mckean vice president of 
human resources has until aug 9 to make its first 
counterproposal with further negotiations scheduled as needed 
the unions current threeyear contract expires oct 3 
before departing for wichita on monday baker said the union 
would ask for a significant wage increase adding he did not 
consider a singledigit increase significant 
except for welders the people who make boeing planes currently 
earn 888 to 1842 per hour depending on pay level and seniority 
the average wage is 1350 to 14 an hour 
all the signals are that it looks good for us boeing can well 
afford to pay an increase in wages and increase benefits baker 
said 
our relations have in general been very good with the union 
said boeing spokesman paul binder he declined to comment on the 
negotiations 
union officials want a wage increase to replace either 
completely or partially the bonuses that have ranged from 3 
percent to 12 percent a year since 1983 
analysts said a reasonable increase would not affect boeings 
profitability especially if it can pass part of the increase on to 
customers boeing also adjusts its prices as labor and commodity 
indexes rise 
customers may have to take a bite in the next three years if 
a wage hike is granted said steve binder senior aerospace analyst 
with bear stearns amp co inc in new york he is not related to 
boeings paul binder 
frank shrontz chairman and chief executive officer has said 
that boeings goal is to hold down costs to improve profit margins 
and increase shareholders return on equity 
the unions bargaining position represents a complete turnaround 
from its position during the 1983 and 1986 negotiations in 1983 
about 12000 boeing workers had been laid off because of the 
industry slump weakening the unions hand at the bargaining table

a jury awarded 100 million in libel 
damages today to gte corp after rejecting home shopping networks 
claim that the communications company was to blame for lost sales 
hsn contended gte didnt give it adequate equipment to handle a 
large volume of calls in 1986 and 1987 as the network expanded into 
11 new markets gte won the case on its counterclaim 
the sixmember jury reached its verdict after about five hours 
of deliberations in the complicated case following a sixweek trial 
before pinellas circuit judge howard rives 
the award was to be split evenly by gte florida and gte 
communciations in a breakdown of each award the jury said 10 
million should by paid by hsn 20 million by board chairman roy 
speer and 20 million by president lowell paxon 
in final arguments monday hsn attorneys said gte told little 
white lies to the network to cover up the communications 
companys failure to provide for the volume of calls 
on tuesday gte lawyer roy reardon responded that a dec 2 
1986 letter placed in evidence documented that hsn thought the 
telephone firm had been responsive to all our previous needs 
and was looking forward to continuing this highly successful 
relationship 
ten months after that hsn sued claiming it lost millions of 
calls and about 500 million in potential sales because its gte 
telephone network equipment was insufficient for the volume of 
calls the parent company based in stamford conn the florida 
subsidiary and gte communications were named as defendants 
in response gte filed a slander and libel counterclaim placing 
blame for hsns decline in the electronics market and stock market 
on its own mismanagement there 
hsns 1986 purchase of 11 uhf stations in new markets combined 
with its entrance into the cable television market caused 
subscribers to soar from 9 million to 465 million in one year 
gtes reardon said 
gte knew about the cable arrangements he added cable companies 
were offered a 1 million stock option which enhanced their 
interest in hsn he said and 70 cable outlets were obtained 
but even when hsn made its initial public offering of stock on 
may 13 1986 the company didnt mention its plans to purchase the 
broadcast stations as a second operational network reardon argued 
he recalled that hsn operations vice president william delany 
warned in september 1986 the company didnt have enough personnel 
to handle the growing number of calls but speer didnt want to 
hear they needed more operators 
competition from similar retailers also has hurt hsn reardon 
said

the washington public power supply system 
announced plans wednesday to reenter the financial markets for the 
first time since defaulting on 225 billion in bonds for two 
nuclear plants in 1983 
wppss said it plans to sell 450 million in revenue bonds to 
refund higher interest bonds sold in 1981 and 1982 pricing and 
sale of the bonds for wppss nuclear plants 1 and 3 are expected to 
take place the week of aug 21 
the 1983 default on bonds for nuclear plants 4 and 5 was the 
largest in municipal bond market history wppss bond ratings were 
suspended in 1983 but standard amp poors corp restablished its 
rating late last year 
the refunding bonds are secured by net billing agreements that 
require the bonneville power administration a selffinanced 
federal agency that markets electric power to pay all costs 
connected with projects 1 and 3 
the net billed bonds are the first step in a longawaited 
refunding program to reduce debt service on about 2 billion of 
high interest bonds the supply system also expects to refund 
aproximately 800 million of highinterest bonds issued for project 
2 over the next several years 
at current interest rates the program will reduce the supply 
systems costs an average of 7080 million a year over the next 
30 years don mazur supply system managing director and jim 
jura bonneville administrator said in a statement 
following the wppss default an amendment to federal bankruptcy 
laws clarified that a bankruptcy would not impair protection of 
revenues funds and other assets of projects 1 2 and 3 from claims 
by projects 4 and 5 bondholders 
in contrast to projects 4 and 5 bonds for projects 1 through 3 
are secured by net billing agreements with bonneville which 
markets power from 30 federal hydroelectric projects most in the 
columbia river basin 
wppss is a consortium of utilities that was formed in the early 
1970s to build the five nuclear plants 
bonneville and participating utilities without interruption have 
provided funds for all obligations with respect to supply system 
bonds on projects 1 through 3 since the first bonds were issued in 
1971 
project 2 has been in commercial operation since 1984 projects 
1 and 3 are in extended construction delay because the energy they 
would produce isnt needed presently

wheat futures prices were mostly higher but corn 
and soybeans lower wednesday on the chicago board of trade where 
the expected commodity fraud indictments may have sent some traders 
to the sidelines early 
while wheat thrived in the wake of a 100000ton buy late 
tuesday by china and rumors of a second buy equally large 
purchases of soybeans established a contract low for the seventh 
time in eight days 
volume was lighter than usual at the exchanges soybean pit 
rumored to be one of four pits at the bot and the chicago 
mercantile exchange where undercover federal agents concentrated 
their investigative efforts during the 2year probe 
it probably kept people away one trader who asked not to be 
identified said of indictments which were announced after the 
markets closed but how much effect it actually had is debatable 
a lot of this is already in the market 
and besides the trader added bearish weather is killing 
the beans not indictments 
on the close wheat was 1 cent lower to 1 cents higher with 
the contract for delivery in september at 389 a bushel corn was 
1 cents lower to 1 cents higher with september at 221 a 
bushel oats were unchanged to cent higher with september at

an advertising agency said wednesday it had 
dropped the helmsley hotels 5 millionayear account saying 
proprietor leona helmsley intruded too much and recently cut agency 
fees by 60 percent 
mrs helmsley who has been on trial in a tax evasion case in 
us district court has been depicted in the advertising as the 
queen standing on guard making sure everything is perfect at 
the hotels 
the ad agency taylorgordon aarons amp co inc had handled the 
helmsley account for the past three years agency president elaine 
taylorgordon said her company stands to lose 500000 a year from 
its decision 
all of us knew she was queen and we were there to serve her 
taylorgordon said it was evident in her body language her 
imperiousness and her arrogance 
she described a typical business meeting with mrs helmsley 
she was drinking martinis and i was drinking brioschi there was 
a lot of tension she told me dont get comfortable youre 
not here for a social event 
agency officials said she sealed her fate with taylorgordon 
aarons when she imposed an arbitrary 60 percent cut in agency fees 
for may and june

ford motor cos 1990 models will cost about 48 
percent more than 1989 models partly because of new federal 
requirements on airbag protection for passengers a preliminary 
price list indicates 
the increase showed up in a ford advisory recently sent to 
dealers for use in taking early orders for fall company spokesman 
dave krupp said wednesday 
about half of that is for air bags krupp said of the price 
boost 
ford will announce final prices for the 1990 models in 
midseptember two to three weeks in advance of the oct 5 debut of 
new vehicles he said 
general motors corp and chrysler corp officials remained 
silent wednesday on their pricing plans for the new model year 
gm will announce prices later this month in preparation for a 
late september introduction of the new models spokesman terry 
sullivan said 
chrysler will announce prices in late september or early october 
and introduce its 1990 models in early october spokeswoman karen 
stewart said 
neither gm nor chrysler has sent preliminary prices to dealers 
the two said analysts have predicted automakers would trim 
production in anticipation of slow 1989 sales continuing into next 
year consequently raising prices 
gm and chrysler have estimated air bags will add 500 to the 
price of a new car and ford has estimated that cost at between 
350 and 700

new york investor irwin l jacobs has made a roughly 285 
billion takeover proposal to avon products inc the latest 
unsolicited offer for the cosmetics company that has spurned 
previous suitors jacobs and avon disclosed wednesday 
james e preston avons chairman and chief executive said 
jacobs request for a meeting to negotiate a possible purchase of 
avon the worlds biggest direct sales company would be reviewed 
at the boards regular meeting on thursday at avons new york 
headquarters 
in a brief news release preston said he sent a letter to jacobs 
informing him that in the past the board members have stressed that 
avon is not for sale 
jacobs who oversees his investment empire from minneapolis 
said in a telephone interview wednesday that hes never been in a 
better position to carry out an acquisition attempt and indicated 
he would be tenacious in his quest for avon 
weve had the best year weve ever had jacobs said all 
these things play a part i have never been more serious about a 
commitment in my life 
in three separate deals in the past year jacobs and investment 
partners reported making more than 164 million in profit 
jacobs 41ashare offer for avon is worth about 225 billion 
based on 5491 million shares of common stock outstanding jacobs 
also said in a filing with the securities and exchange commission 
that he contemplates redeeming avons preferred shares which would 
cost 3350 per share or a total of about 603 million raising 
the price tag on avon to roughly 285 billion 
avon also has about 1 billion in debt that would be part of any 
acquisition 
avon stock gained 1 to 3650 a share in composite new york 
stock exchange trading wednesday 
the company has slammed the door on at least two suitors in 
recent months 
in may the avon board rejected a hostile 39ashare takeover 
bid from rival direct selling company amway corp and indicated at 
the time that it would resist future acquisition attempts 
only days after avon turned down amway mary kay corp parent 
of the doortodoor makeup seller mary kay cosmetics inc 
disclosed its interest in acquiring avon and also got a cold 
shoulder 
although amway withdrew its bid of about 21 billion the 
company still has a stake in avon 
through a partnership with jacobs amway has an interest in 
about 103 percent of avons common stock outstanding jacobs 
controls about 55 percent of the avon stock owned by aj 
partnership as the alliance of amway and jacobs is called 
the partnership didnt act jointly in making the initial bid for 
avon and jacobs said they are not acting together now 
if he prevails in his takeover attempt jacobs said he would 
keep avons core directselling business in the united states and 
retain a significant interest in the companys international 
division 
there are about 475000 avon sales representatives operating in 
the united states and another 1 million selling avon cosmetics 
toiletries and jewelry in foreign markets avon known in the past 
for the ad slogan ding dong avon calling is the worlds 
biggest directsales company 
jacobs said if he gets control of avon he would sell avons 
retail division which consists of some of the countrys 
bestselling perfumes sold at department store counters including 
giorgio beverly hills and red 
he also would finish divesting the health care businesses which 
avon has been selling 
the divestitures have been part of avons strategy to enhance 
profitability in the second quarter avon earned 395 million on 
sales of 778 million compared with a loss of 825 million and 
sales of 704 million a year earlier 
jacobs said he had no intention of selling any piece of avon to 
amway or to mary kay he said he has not had any contact with avon 
executives except a telephone call to acknowledge receipt of his 
letter 
jacobs wouldnt take a management position at avon if he gains 
control he said but he said he is familiar with the industry by 
virtue of his ownership of watkins inc of winona minn jacobs 
purchased the health and beauty aids company out of bankruptcy in 
1977 
jacobs said he has hired an investment banking arm of citicorp 
to help him arrange financing for the allcash offer for avon

cocoa futures snapped a slump and surged wednesday on rumors 
that the ivory coast the worlds largest producer had sold 
500000 tons to a major trading house 
on other markets sugar continued rallying in the face of 
growing demand and the fear of weak yields from western eurpoean 
crops soybeans fell to a new low for the seventh time in eight 
days depressed by wet weather and stuck there because many traders 
halted trading early to await indictments stemming for a 2year 
investigation into commodities trading fraud 
cocoa traded on the new york coffee sugar and cocoa exchange 
jumped at the opening bell after rumors surfaced that ivory coast 
president felix houphetboigny who had been in france in recent 
days helped seal a huge export deal with trading company philipp 
brothers inc 
the rumored deal suggested a heightened demand for cocoa which 
has languished recently the size of such a purchase if confirmed 
would also raise the possibility of shortterm supply problems 
as sleepy as the market had been a lot of traders thought the 
market was at its technical bottom and as soon as it got a boost 
from the ivory coast report there were a lot of people jumping on 
the bandwagon said pete henig who tracks commodities for refco 
inc new york 
cocoa climbed 66 to 70 per ton higher with the contract for 
delivery in september at 1327 a ton 
sugar continued gaining because demand is outpacing supply 
early reports that a virus has cut substantially into crop yields 
in west germany and france helped bolster prices 
sugar climbed 22 cent to 31 cent higher with october at 1443 
cents a pound 
nervousness over commodity fraud indictments announced after 
the close of business wednesday had sent some traders to the 
sidelines early at the chicago board of trade wheat futures prices 
closed higher but corn and soybeans were mostly lower 
wheat thrived in the wake of a 100000ton buy late tuesday by 
the chinese and there were rumors they planned a second equally 
large purchase 
but november soybeans slipped 7 cents establishing a contract 
low for the seventh time in eight days 
the indictments probably kept people away said one trader 
who asked not to be identified but how much effect it actually 
had is debatable a lot of this is already in the market 
and besides the trader added bearish weather is killing 
the beans not indictments 
wheat was unchanged to 2 cents higher with the contract for 
delivery in september at 390 a bushel corn was 1 cent lower to 
1 cents higher with september at 221 a bushel oats were 
cent to cent higher with september at 133 a bushel and 
soybeans were 1 cents to 8 cents lower with august at 608 a 
bushel 
livestock and pork futures were sharply higher at the chicago 
mercantile exchange 
live cattle climbed 35 cent to 120 cents with august at 7355 
cents a pound feeder cattle were 17 cent to 60 cent higher with 
august at 8362 cents pound live hogs were 23 cent to 123 cents 
higher with august at 4635 cents a pound and frozen pork bellies 
were 35 cent to 110 cents higher with august at 2592 cents a 
pound 
precious metals were off slightly with silver leading the 
decline

the rare phenomenon of a summer air fare war broke out 
wednesday as several major airlines matched a discount program 
announced a day earlier by continental airlines 
houstonbased continental often a farecutting leader said

day on most nonstops and lowered transcontinental fares to 100 
each way

basis and are nonrefundable 
the cuts were quickly matched tuesday by northwest airlines and 
alaska airlines american airlines and united airlines two of the 
largest carriers joined in wednesday along with braniff inc and 
trans world airlines 
for competitive reasons we will match this said bob 
blattner a twa spokesman in st louis mo 
fares normally hold steady or rise in summer when travel demand 
is at its peak 
recent research shows that more and more americans want to 
take several more short vacations or long weekend trips 
continental spokesman ned walker said tuesday so what weve done 
is develop this nationwide weekend fare program to meet this 
growing trend 
tickets must be purchased by aug 11 and must be paid for within 
24 hours after a reservation is made travel must begin on a 
thursday friday or saturday

sales of new homes climbed 55 percent in 
june the third consecutive monthly increase the government said 
wednesday in a report that gave some economists hope that a rebound 
in housing will help keep the country out of a recession this year 
the commerce department said sales of new singlefamily homes 
rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 670000 units in june 
as sales continued to respond favorably to falling mortgage rates 
after skidding in march to their slowest pace in more than six 
years 
mortgage rates which peaked at 1122 percent for fixedrate 
loans in march have been falling since that time helped along by 
credit easing on the part of the federal reserve 
optimistic forecasters said they believed a rebound in housing 
and other creditsensitive sectors of the economy would be enough 
to keep the record peacetime expansion chugging along although at 
a more modest pace in the second half of the year 
we are confident that we can avoid a recession said thomas 
lawler an economist at the federal national mortgage association 
housing is recovering from a slump earlier in the year as people 
respond to lower interest rates 
but a second economic report wednesday produced less enthusiasm 
the commerce department said new orders for manufactured goods 
remained weak in june edging up by only 04 percent after a steep 
26 percent drop in may 
factory orders have fallen in three of the past six months and 
the widespread view is that manufacturing will weaken further in 
coming months as businesses cut back their own investment plans 
but many economists said they believed strong export sales and a 
rebound in housing would be enough to keep the economy moving 
forward 
if exports continue fairly strong and housing comes back that 
will help offset the weakness in other areas said cynthia latta 
an economist with drimcgraw hill we believe we will be able to 
skim by without a recession 
ms latta said her optimism was based in part on the fact that 
sales of both new and existing homes posted good gains in june 
even before the biggest part of the drop in mortgage rates had 
occurred in july 
fixed rate mortgages are currently averaging 981 percent their 
lowest level since early 1987 economists are predicting further 
declines in the months ahead as the fed continues easing credit in 
an effort to prevent a recession 
buyers are taking advantage of falling interest rates to buy 
the most they can afford said john a tuccillo chief economist 
of the national association of realtors the continued decline in 
rates is drawing buyers to new homes as well as existing homes 
the 55 percent rise in new home sales in june followed a 43 
percent may advance and a 97 percent rise in april altogether 
the three months of increases have driven home sales 207 percent 
above their low point of the year an annual rate of 555000 sales 
in march which was the weakest sales pace since december 1982 in 
the depths of the last recession 
home prices were up as well in june with the median price of a 
new home jumping 83 percent to 129900 the median price means 
half the homes sold for more and half for less the average price 
of a new home was up 84 percent to 159100 
housing analysts said part of the increase reflects the fact 
that much of the market is composed of moveup buyers who can 
afford more expensive homes 
the june increase in sales was powered by a 234 percent jump in 
sales in the west which climbed to an annual rate of 232000 
units the california real estate market is currently the strongest 
in the country 
sales in the midwest were up as well but by a smaller 31 
percent to an annual rate of 99000 units sales in the south edged 
up 19 percent to a rate of 267000 units 
the increases were enough to offset a giant 182 percent drop in 
new home sales in the northeast which fell to an annual rate of 
72000 units analysts said that the northeast until last year the 
hottest market in country was suffering from a sharp runup in 
prices 
david seiders chief economist for the national association of 
home builders said he believed price declines were inevitable in 
this region especially given the high inventory of unsold homes 
being carried by many developers

an attorney who admitted she mistakenly 
gave confidential court documents to a reporter during the time 
inc takeover fight has been ordered to appear before the delaware 
supreme court 
barbara robbins of the new yorkbased law firm wachtell lipton 
rosen amp katz has been ordered to court aug 22 to show why she 
should not be held in contempt 
robbins was on vacation wednesday and could not be reached for 
comment 
law partner michael schwartz called the incident inadvertant 
and not blameworthy 
the law firm represented warner communications inc which had 
an agreement to be acquired by time paramount communications inc 
attempting a hostile takeover of time was appealing a chancery 
court ruling that refused to block the merger 
the documents had been submitted by paramount in its appeal the 
court had ordered the documents be kept confidential after a 
request from time because they contained estimates of the dollar 
value of times core businesses including the value of people 
sports illustrated time and fortune magazines 
the estimates appeared july 26 in an article in the new york 
times 
a spokesperson for warner who did not want to be identified 
called it an honest mistake 
we know that there was no intention on her part to violate the 
court order and were convinced it was an honest mistake the 
spokesperson said 
robbins admitted to the court last thursday that she supplied 
the documents to a times reporter unaware the documents were 
confidential 
in a letter to state supreme court administrator stephen d 
taylor robbins said the documents were not stamped confidential 
under seal on the cover 
as i am sure you can imagine as warners counsel i certainly 
would have had no desire to release to the public documents as to 
which time sought confidential treatment indeed in chancery 
court warner joined with time in seeking confidentiality with 
respect to certain documents robbins wrote 
it is an unfortunate outcome of a document not being stamped 
confidential which paramount should have stamped confidential 
schwartz said

a dissident democrat said wednesday that 
despite the allout opposition of party leaders he has enough 
support in the house of representatives to win a reduction in 
capitalgains taxes 
i have them now rep ed jenkins dga said when asked 
whether he has pledges of enough votes to win the debate 
jenkins talked to reporters after a closeddoor democratic 
caucus that leaders said indicated a substantial majority of party 
members oppose a cut in the tax on capital gains which are profits 
from the sale of stocks and other investments however some 
acknowledged that if a vote were taken immediately enough 
democrats would join a solid bloc of republicans to pass the 
reduction 
i think a majority of democrats take the position that we 
should not agree to this particular issue said speaker thomas s 
foley dwash i believe its bad tax policy bad fiscal policy 
unwise inequitable and illtimed 
rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the taxwriting ways 
and means committee was still trying to win back at least one of 
the six democrats on the panel who are backing a capitalgains cut 
he offered a compromise that rather than reducing thetax rate 
would benefit investors by protecting inflationcaused profits 
against taxation 
republicans surprised me with how receptive they were to his 
proposal rostenkowski said after briefing members of his 
committee he called his plan pretty much what i view as a 
possible compromise where everybody wins 
his proposal less generous than jenkins would benefit most 
assets except preferred stock stock in foreign corporations debt 
instruments and other intangibles it would work this way for 
assets purchased after july 31 1989 
if held for more than one year but less than five the asset 
would be indexed for inflation that is total inflation over 
the years the property was owned would be subtracted from the 
purchase price thus only the noninflation gain would be taxed 
if held for more than five years but less than 10 an investor 
could subtract inflation or could exclude from tax 25 percent of 
the sales price 
if held for more than 10 years an investor could subtract 
inflation or 50 percent of the sales price 
i think theres a hopeful atmosphere of some kind of 
compromise rostenkowski told reporters he suggested the bush 
administration should get more involved in the negotiations 
its very difficult for me to negotiate with the white house 
with rep bill archer a texan who is senior republican on ways 
and means i dont know who it is that can say ok weve got an 
understanding 
rep jj pickle of texas one of the six dissident ways and 
means democrats sounded a similar tone compromise must come 
from the white house pickle said if they dont well just 
have a little shootout 
the administration already has agreed informally to a compromise 
of sorts 
bush proposed that the maximum tax on capital gains now 33 
percent be reduced to 15 percent he reasoned that would boost 
investment create jobs and spur so much economic activity that 
government revenues would increase and help reduce the deficit 
there was almost no support among ways and means democrats for 
that proposal so jenkins and archer came up with a substitute 
which now has the administrations backing 
the jenkinsarcher proposal would cut the top rate to 196 
percent for two years then increase it to 28 percent and ensure 
that gains caused by inflation would not be taxed 
democratic leaders oppose a capitalgains rate cut for three 
reasons because 80 percent of the benefit would go to investors 
with incomes totaling 100000 a year or more they say it would 
reduce government revenues after the first year or two and they 
fear that restoring a capitalgains tax preference that was 
repealed as part of the 1986 tax overhaul would lead to the 
unraveling of that landmark law 
in an effort to block the jenkinsarcher plan rostenkowski 
offered a new formula that would prevent taxation of 
inflationcaused gains and also give investors at least a slight 
break in the tax on their profits that represented a real increase 
in the value of property 
however there was no indication that rostenkowskis proposal 
had drawn any votes away from the jenkinsarcher plan 
rep jim moody dwis who opposes a capitalgains cut 
cautioned against concluding that the jenkinsarcher amendment will 
carry the day we are beginning an education campaign to point 
out issues of fairness in connection with capital gains moody said 
time is on the side of the package that will be worked on by 
the chairman said moody hes very sensitive to the 
pressures

attorneys are haggling over millions of dollars 
in the eastern airlines strikebankruptcy case but all beatrice 
lovinger wants is the 3720 she spent on nowuseless eastern 
tickets for her family 
im a grandmother ms lovinger 57 told a public meeting 
of eastern creditors wednesday its pretty horrible that big 
business can do this to me and i can be out this amount of 
money im overwrought about it 
ms lovinger who lives in new york says she purchased 13 
tickets for her children and grandchildren in january so they could 
fly from new york to miami for a family gathering in midapril 
easterns three unions struck march 4 grounding the miamibased 
carrier and forcing it to seek the refuge of chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection 
ms lovinger joined the thousands of other hapless ticketholders 
caught by the strike hoping a federal bankruptcy court in 
manhattan will make sure eastern compensates them 
continental airlines easterns sister carrier has been 
honoring eastern tickets but ms lovinger said continental offered 
only to put her and relatives on standby status she wants her 
money back or guaranteed seats 
i need the tickets the way i bought them she told about 60 
eastern attorneys creditors shareholders and employees at madison 
square gardens felt forum in midtown manhattan 
on july 21 eastern filed a proposed reorganization plan which 
it said would provide for full repayment of the 33 billion owed 
to all creditors including ticketholders 
under the plan people like ms lovinger could exchange their 
tickets for cash with interest or more valuable tickets on the 
postbankruptcy eastern but the plan must receive approval by the 
bankruptcy court and other creditors first so ms lovinger could 
be in for a long wait 
this example is symptomatic of a problem we see coming up 
james flug an attorney for consumers union said of the 
grandmothers case flug who also attended the eastern meeting 
said consumers union has heard of dozens of similar cases 
consumers union the nonprofit consumer advocacy group that 
publishes consumer reports magazine has asked the court to require 
eastern to reimburse passengers before the company pays off other 
creditors

atlantic richfield co said wednesday it 
would sell its arco solar subsidiary which the oil giant had spent 
12 years and 200 million building into the largest such operation 
in the world 
the sale to west germanys siemens ag which has teamed up with 
arco in a joint solar venture since 1987 was expected to be 
completed this fall arco and siemens said terms of the deal 
werent announced 
arco solar a pet project of former arco chairman robert 
anderson had never turned a profit but the company and solar 
industry observers said the small quickly evolving solar industry 
continues to show great promise 
they interpreted the sale as part of a backtobasics trend in 
the us oil industry and said siemens with its 
telecommunications power generation electronics and other 
businesses can better exploit solar technology than can arco 
it is a better fit in the siemens scheme of things a 
company that is into so many related industries arco spokesman 
albert greenstein said our core business is oil gas and 
petrochemicals and we feel that arco solar is just not part of our 
longterm strategy for energy development 
siemens said the arco operation will help the conglomerate 
develop solar energy worldwide as the technology is used 
increasingly in isolated areas without power from utilities 
the solar industry boomed by 35 percent in 1988 to about 185 
million in sales worldwide said solar energy consultant bob 
johnson at the present time the producers of power modules cant 
keep up with demand 
arco solar had about 30 million of those sales a big chunk of 
the solar market but a paltry fraction of the 188 billion 
generated by arco the nations seventhlargest oil company 
arco solars devices have ranged from small battery chargers to 
power modules for cars boats rooftops and mountain communications 
relay stations 
it also operates two solar power farms in california a 
1megawatt facility in san bernardino county and a 65megawatt 
facility in san luis obispo county siemens did not buy those and 
arco is seeking a buyer greenstein said 
i think its singular how long arco has maintained interest in 
solar said consultant johnson of strategies unlimited a 
mountain view calif market research firm that studies solar 
electric conversions 
since 1974 there have been a total of eight us petroleum 
companies involved in commercial or research and development of 
solar electric at this present time there remain just two amoco 
and mobil 
amocos solar subsidiary is solarex corp the secondlargest 
us solar company with sales johnson estimated at 18 million last 
year christopher pope a spokesman for the rockville md 
company said he remained optimistic about the industry 
the technology has improved dramatically in the last five 
years pope said weve seen about a halving of our prices and 
manufacturing volumes are up dramatically 
arcos and solarexs main products are the panels or modules 
that can be wired together in various ways and can be seen atop 
many roofs they also power communications relay stations atop the 
rockies and andes and ice plants for egyptian fishermen whose catch 
would otherwise rot in the sun pope noted 
pope said he expects the next market for solar power to be in 
small power tools appliances outdoor lights and the like just as 
solarpowered hand calculators and watches have become common 
the fact that siemens is getting into it another bluechip 
company its an indication of the viability of the business 
pope said 
arco solar which employs about 400 people is based in 
camarillo about 50 miles northwest of downtown los angeles arco 
said siemens would retain arco solars management and staff 
continue operations in camarillo and honor all distributor 
marketing agreements 
since 1987 arco solar and siemens solar have operated pv 
electric gmbh making and selling solar products mainly to the auto 
industry based on thin film silicon technology licensed from arco 
solar the joint venture has a factory in munich and conducts 
research on solar technology 
arco chairman and chief executive officer lodwrick m cook said 
every effort was made to find a buyer with the management depth 
financial resources commitment to solar energy and willingness to 
retain the current management staff and facilities siemens met 
those criteria

3612 a share in canadian currency for falconbridge 
the offer is worth about 24 billion or 3050 in us 
dollars an amax spokeswoman said the acquisition is subject to 
approval by canadian regulatory authorities 
falconbridge is an excellent organization with quality people 
and assets its acquisition will complement amaxs current metals 
businesses and position the company well to serve growing 
markets said allen born amaxs chairman chief executive and 
president 
amax earned 741 million on revenue of 42 billion in 1988 in 
the first six months of this year the company reported 2451 
million in profits on revenue of 206 billion 
amax shares closed up 12 cents wednesday at 2550 in

falconridge shares was delayed until after the amax announcement 
the stock shot up after it began trading closing at 3662 up 
637 on the toronto stock exchange 
in the last year amax sought to expand operations and born said 
it was interested in acquiring natural gas properties 
the possibility of expansion seemed unlikely in 1985 when amax 
ended four years with 17 billion in losses 
in addition to illadvised ventures into silver and energy amax 
rejected lucrative takeover offers from standard oil of california 
now chevron corp its interest payments on debts totaled 200 
million a year

diluted shares the amax spokeswoman said 
if the deal goes through amax has agreed to make an additional 
offer to acquire all untendered shares amax recently moved its 
headquarters from greenwich to new york but maintains corporate 
offices here 
falconbridge immediately implemented a shareholder rights plan 
to defend against hostile offers the measures would give existing 
shareholders the right to purchase additional stock at a bargain 
rate if another party acquires at least 15 percent of falconbridge 
stock 
the socalled poison pill plan will expire in 120 days if 
the deal is not approved by shareholders amax and falconbridge 
said in a joint statement 
the amax spokeswoman said the company abandoned the nickel 
business because it was only a refiner and not a miner she said 
falconbridge presented amax with a quality position in which it 
will both mine and refine nickel

negotiators for boeing co and the 
machinists union began talks wednesday on how much money will go 
into the next union contract and how it will be distributed 
ron eldridge business representative of the machinists 
district 70 in wichita wouldnt reveal the contents of the initial 
proposal the union made to the aerospace company he called it 
fair reasonable and justified 
the machinists current 3year pact with boeing expires oct 3 
industry analysts say the union is in a good position to extract 
favorable terms from boeing a strike is unlikely they say 
primarily because boeing is already having difficulty delivering 
airplanes on time 
the unions have a heck of a lever this time around 
particularly after being given the wire brush the last two times 
around said paul nisbet an aerospace analyst for 
prudentialbache securities inc 
boeing officials declined comment on any aspect of the 
negotiations we do not discuss any of that in the press said 
boeing spokesman paul binder 
eldridge said getting a general wage increase is the top 
priority of the union the machinists at boeing have not had a 
general wage increase for six years with the union settling in 
each of the last two contracts for lumpsum bonuses 
boeing analysts say is likely to again offer substantial 
bonuses in an attempt to avoid a general wage increase that would 
also raise the costs of overtime and benefits and lock the company 
into higher expenses even if economic conditions should turn sour 
what boeing would like to do is give the employees a part of 
the boom times but not get stuck when the weak times come said 
analyst william whitlow of dain bosworth in seattle where boeing 
is based 
the expiring contract paid workers a 12 percent bonus in 1986 
and 5 percent the following two years 
eldridge said surveys of union members showed that as many as 65 
percent of them support the goal of a general wage increase and 
that such sentiment was even stronger in wichita 
since the last contract was negotiated three years ago boeing 
has been amassing record sales and profits on the strength of 
unprecedented orders for new airliners 
just last week boeing announced its earnings for the first six 
months of 1989 were 356 million a 20 percent increase over a year 
earlier the company has nearly 37 billion in cash and 
investments and an order backlog valued at nearly 68 billion 
boeing has until aug 9 to make a counterproposal 
eldridge said he expects the negotiations to be tough boeing 
has a long history of taking you right down to the wire and well 
probably be meeting on oct 3 he said

officials at the worlds two largest commodities 
exchanges moved quickly wednesday to bolster public confidence 
after a federal grand jury indicted 46 traders on charges of making 
illegal trades 
but ordinary traders at bars near the chicago mercantile 
exchange and chicago board of trade in the downtown lasalle street 
financial district took a more lowkey view of the indictments 
several traders refused to comment on the indictments while 
others expressed mixed opinions about the federal probe that 
resulted in charges ranging from tax fraud to racketeering those 
traders willing to comment refused to identify themselves 
if theyre dirty then they deserve it one trader shouted 
over his shoulder as he walked out of the trade inn across from the 
board of trade building 
but other traders questioned the validity of the indictments 
which resulted from a 2year undercover fbi investigation at the 
two exchanges the charges involve such violations as prearranged 
trading altering trading records and withholding customer orders 
from the market in order to dole them out to compatriots 
from the indictments emerge a picture of several dozen traders 
none of whom are considered especially influential who allegedly 
conspired to skim profits from customers accounts and hide the 
profits from the internal revenue service 
some traders at the limit up bar in the mercantile exchange 
building portrayed several of those indicted as basically honest 
brokers who were not smart enough to cheat 
there are things that look real dishonest that are done for 
the good of the customers said one trader who has been a member 
of the mercantile exchange for 10 years he refused to elaborate on 
what practices he meant 
the trader said he thought the federal investigation has focused 
so far on traders who had done little wrong 
theyre taking honest people and turning them into crooks 
said the trader if theyre looking for something bigger thats 
fine great 
the trader and two colleagues sitting at the bar denied ever 
breaking exchange rules and defended the record of most traders 
thats very good if all they can find is 24 bad apples out 
of the 2724 seats on the mercantile exchange he said 
the government announced indictments of 22 traders at the board 
of trade and 24 at the merc the exchanges were not accused of 
wrongdoing and neither were any of the scores of brokerage firms 
whose customers were allegedly cheated 
officials at both exchanges said those traders under indictment 
would be barred from trading except for their own personal accounts 
when asked about the number of indictments cbot chairman 
karsten mahlmann told a news conference that one was too many 
and vowed to protect the integrity of the exchange 
mahlmann said the cbot had launched its own investigation of 
traders before reports about the fbi probe surfaced in january but 
was asked by federal authorities to hold off while the government 
investigation continued 
cbot president thomas donovan said the exchange has since moved 
to improve its computer surveillance system so that it will be able 
to audit all transactions within one business day and stiffen its 
maximum fines for violations from 75000 to 250000 
donovan said the board would conduct its own investigation into 
the practices of the indicted traders and revoke the trading 
privileges of anyone who pleads guilty or is convicted on charges 
stemming from the probe 
without integrity being a major part of the way we do 
business we cannot exist donovan told the news conference 
at the merc leo melamed chairman of the executive committee 
and john t geldermann chairman of the board of governors issued 
a statement promising to deal severely with any member found 
guilty of the federal charges 
they said the merc had commissioned a special committee to 
review all trading practices
