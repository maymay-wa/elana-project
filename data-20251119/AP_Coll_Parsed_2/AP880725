the soviet union has been escorting 
kuwaiti oil through the persian gulf for about as long as the 
united states has but its secretive lowkey operation has 
attracted far less notice 
while criticizing washington for escalating tensions in the 
region and calling for a unsponsored force to replace foreign 
navies in the gulf the soviets have maintained their own flotilla 
in the waterway since late 1986 
five european countries britain france italy belgium and 
the netherlands also have kept warships in the gulf in the past 
year all of these forces along with those of the united states 
are expected to be reduced or removed if a unsponsored 
ceasefire takes hold 
there are usually about 25 to 30 foreign warships in the 
strategic gulf most of them american the total in the region is 
around 60 including frances sizable indian ocean fleet based at 
djibouti 
the exact number of soviet vessels in the gulf and nearby waters 
is difficult to pin down but us officials say it has hovered at 
about seven to nine for the past year 
the force normally includes two destroyers plus oceangoing mine 
sweepers tugboats and supply vessels 
the soviet convoys with one or two warships escorting small 
groups of cargo vessels flying the flags of the soviet union and 
other east bloc countries are often seen in the gulf 
their convoys sail without the air cover available to the us 
warships that escort usflagged kuwaiti tankers and their radio 
traffic is limited to routine exchanges and greetings with the 
warships of other nations 
the only known example of direct cooperation between the us 
and soviet forces occurred jan 5 when a soviet minehunter advised 
a us cruiser in the gulf that it had found a mine and us 
helicopters took part in a search for others the mine eventually 
was destroyed by the soviets us officials say 
moscows naval operations are run from a coastal anchorage near 
the united arab emirates port of khor fakkhan in the gulf of oman 
close to the staging area for the us navys kuwaiti tanker 
convoys 
the soviets have long maintained a naval base at socotra island 
off the horn of africa that is owned by south yemen the arab 
worlds only marxist state after the iraqiran war broke out in 
september 1980 they posted one or two warships outside the strait 
of hormuz gateway to the gulf 
the deployment of soviet warships to the gulf was never 
announced but became apparent when two destroyers turned up in the 
waterway shortly after iranian gunboats intercepted two soviet 
cargo ships in september 1986 
in early 1987 moscow agreed to lease three soviet tankers to 
kuwait and provide them with armed escort 
the move seen by some us officials as part of efforts by 
moscow to expand its influence in the oilrich region spurred the 
reagan administrations decision to reflag 11 kuwaitowned tankers 
with the stars and stripes 
one of the soviet tankers the 679870ton marshal chuikov hit 
a mine off kuwait on may 16 1987 the incident was quickly 
obscured the next day when the frigate uss stark was blasted by 
errant iraqi missiles killing 37 sailors 
except for the marshal chuikov mining and a few reports of 
soviet warships finding mines us officials say they are not 
aware of any incidents involving the soviet forces in the past 1 
years 
the iranians probably know that if they ever tried to 
interfere with a soviet tanker theyd be blown to bits and nothing 
would ever be explained one way or another a us navy officer 
said several months ago 
the soviets gulf force consists of destroyers of the 7900ton 
sovremenny class or the 8000ton udaloy class and natya or yurka 
class mine sweepers foreign naval sources have said the ships are 
difficult to identify because the soviets change hull numbers 
periodically

more states decreased taxes than raised them 
this year and the total increase among the 27 states was an 
unusually low 600 million according to the national conference of 
legislatures 
the organization in a survey of state tax policies said 13 
states raised taxes and 14 lowered them with most revisions 
relatively minor 
traditionally a tax change is considered large only if it 
results in at least a 5 percent increase or decrease in revenue by 
this standard the only large increases this year were reported 
in arizona and louisiana and the only large decreases came in 
south dakota and utah according to the conference 
the survey is part of a broader report to be released this week 
at the conferences annual meeting in reno nev 
to a considerable extent 1988 tax actions are related to the 
tax policy followed last year the conference said the large 
number of tax increases last year helped to improve financial 
conditions and thereby avoided the need to increase taxes this 
year 
the organization also said the 600 million tax increase this 
year is smaller than those in most recent years 
in 1985 the survey said there was a tax reduction of 13 
billion all other years since 1981 had tax increases of at least 
11 billion which came in 1986 the next smallest increase in 
this decade was a 23 billion rise in 1984 
state tax collections exceed 260 billion per year according to 
the conference 
the survey said income taxes were reduced in 10 states and 
increased in two motor fuel taxes were hiked in nine states and 
sales taxes either through a higher rate or broader base went 
up in five states while being lowered in three others 
the most significant tax increases this year came in arizona 
louisiana and west virginia although they were spared major tax 
hikes in 1987 citizens in utah south dakota and kansas saw the 
biggest tax reductions after seeing taxes increase in 1987 
arizona and massachusetts were the only two states to increase 
income taxes arizona also hiked a number of other taxes including 
property and motor fuel taxes 
louisiana and west virginia were the only states to increase 
their sales taxes significantly louisianas sales tax went up 2 
cents on food utilities and drugs and west virginias rate jumped 
1 cent for a 13month period 
while the most frequent tax changes involved motor fuel sales 
or income taxes some states found other sources of revenue 
iowa and rhode island increased their cigarette tax joining 11 
states that did the same in 1987 and massachusetts for the first 
time imposed such a tax 
a recent trend of taxing mail order sales continued this year 
with tennessee joining 11 other states in enacting such a tax 
which still faces court tests 
arizona and parts of washington state increased taxes on 
hotelmotel rooms washington also increased its tax on hazardous 
waste while lowering a tax on aluminum casting the property 
transfer tax increased in vermont and insurance premium taxes were 
lowered in florida and minnesota

the drought that has forced okefenokee 
swamps wildlife to gather near deeper pools and its alligators to 
engage in cannibalism is necessary for the survival of the swamp 
a parks official says 
the swamp has tolerated drought for thousands of years 
drought is a part of the biological process that creates open water 
areas and marsh areas said john schroer manager of the 
okefenokee national wildlife refuge 
swamp vegetation dries out during a drought increasing the 
chance of wildfire ignited by lightning but schroer said 
wildfires are necessary because they burn off floating islands of 
peat which eventually can turn into dry land indians dubbed the 
swamp the land of the trembling earth because of the undulating 
peat 
in 1954 and 1955 fires raged for 12 months burning 80 percent 
of the swamp and fires in the 1840s created some of the 
okefenokees lakes by burning large holes in the peat 
if it werent for the natural wildfires that have occurred 
throughout history the swamp would not be a swamp said schroer 
it would be a forest 
the peat floats to the surface of the swamps reflective 
teacolored water forming islands that support vegetation 
eventually trees begin growing in the peat sinking their roots 
into the swamps sandy bottom the islands get larger and larger 
and without fires they could be transformed into forests 
the 700squaremile swamp in southeastern georgia and 
northeastern florida is home to many types of animals including 
rare birds fish poisonous snakes and alligators many exotic 
plants also thrive including orchids lilies cypress trees and 
carnivorous pitcher plants president franklin d roosevelt 
designated most of the swamp a national wildlife refuge in 1937 
the drought has caused wildlife to congregate near water holes 
schroer said game officials recently counted nearly 1000 
alligators along a 5mile spillway on the swamps western side 
when they get concentrated predators have more prey he 
said alligators start eating other alligators weve seen some 
cannibalistic activity but this is natures way of keeping 
populations in check the big males typically try to keep other 
males out of their territory 
schroer said water levels are 8 to 10 inches below normal on the 
east side of the swamp near the suwannee canal levels are about a 
foot below normal near the 80acre stephen c foster state park on 
the swamps western edge near fargo and the water is 5 to 6 feet 
below normal near the spillway 
visitors can still take twoday canoe trips into the swamp from 
the suwannee canal but the longer trips of up to five days have 
been canceled because boats have trouble navigating some of the 
shallow trails schroer said 
barbara metts assistant superintendent at georgias foster 
state park said anglers can still reach billys lake a popular 
fishing spot but canoe trails to minnies and big water lakes are 
closed because of low water 
jimmy walker general manager of the privately run okefenokee 
swamp park near waycross said his park continues to offer 4mile 
boat tours but has discontinued 10mile tours deeper into the swamp 
to avoid damaging boat motors in the shallow water 
the water is low but its not critically low like it was two 
years ago he said 
during the 1986 drought walker had to cancel all boat tours and 
was able to walk along trails that normally carried boatloads of 
visitors 
ms metts said she went fishing recently with her mother and 
the womans brightly colored bobber attracted an 8foot alligator 
the gators are plentiful and they love to visit the 
fishermen she said one of the gators fell in love with her 
bobber needless to say we didnt catch anything

authorities said 
about 20550 gallons of a petroleum refinery waste product

officer for the tennessee emergency management agency it was not 
known how much of the substance actually went into indian camp 
creek which eventually flows to the harpeth river ms mcguigan 
said 
there were no injuries and no evacuations and the spill should 
not threaten any drinking water supplies because of purification 
she said 
but she added it is harmful to aquatic life when it gets in 
the water it takes out oxygen

a practice space shuttle countdown 
was under way here today in a test leading to a firing of 
discoverys three main engines on the launch pad saturday 
the launch team started the count at 1133 pm sunday on 
wednesday it planned to load more than a half million gallons of 
liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellant into the shuttles 
external fuel tank 
it will be the first time a shuttle has been fueled since the 
challenger explosion which killed seven astronauts on jan 28 
1986 
when the countdown reaches 10 seconds before a mock liftoff on 
wednesday a problem will be simulated to force a launch 
postponement then launch crews will rehearse whats called a 
72hour turnaround 
they will empty the fuel tank start another countdown refill 
the tank and aim for a 20second test firing of discoverys main 
engines at 730 am saturday 
the firing with the shuttle bolted firmly on the pad will 
check modifications made to the engines and is considered critical 
to discovery being certified for the first postchallenger shuttle 
flight 
the launch with a fiveman crew is scheduled for early 
september but the date is in doubt as engineers continue to puzzle 
over how to fix a small gas leak in a steering engine system that 
is separate from the main engines 
they hope to make the repair on the pad and avoid rolling 
discovery back to a hangar a move that could delay the flight as 
much as two months 
experts are considering several ways to reach the inaccessible 
leak including cutting a hole through the shuttles cargo bay wall 
and running a snakelike tube through the gas line in an effort to 
plug it 
the national aeronautics and space administration said it will 
not make a decision on whether to move discovery off the pad until 
after the main engine test firing

union carbide corps chairman was 
delighted that a national magazine named danbury americas best 
place to live but another resident says she was stunned because 
she finds the city boring 
in its secondannual rating of 300 us areas money magazines 
current issue ranked the danbury metropolitan area as the most 
livable 
danbury about 60 miles northeast of new york city in 
southwestern connecticut once was known as the hat city 
because hatters plied their trade here starting before the american 
revolution the last hat factory closed in 1987 
today the city of about 70000 people is the home of union 
carbide danburys largest employer 
we are very happy here said robert d kennedy chairman and 
chief executive officer of the giant chemical company and the 
company which moved its headquarters from new york city to an 
innovative suburban complex in 198081 is here to stay he added 
theres no better place to be we came at a time when the city 
of danbury was beginning the sort of comeback theyve since 
enjoyed kennedy said 
but a shopper on main street said she was surprised about the 
honor 
i dont know why said the woman who identified herself 
only as barbara its boring when we want to do something we go 
into the new york city she said she hopes to move soon 
money magazine said danbury unseated last years no 1 area 
nashua nh because of a lower crime rate slightly better 
schools and its proximity to new york 
john everett an aide to nashua mayor john donchess said the 
mayor who was unavailable for comment would not be upset about 
losing the top spot because nashua remained in the top 10 
everett said last years top ranking gave the city more exposure 
id go somewhere and say im from nashua new hampshire and 
people would say theyd heard of it he said the old saying 
used to be you go to nashua on the way to somewhere else 
the magazine said its staffers studied government and private 
data on the 300 largest metropolitan areas ranking their crime 
rates housing health care economy arts education transit 
system weather and leisure activities 
danbury mayor joseph h sauer jr said he was very proud 
im not naive to think this took place in the last eight 
months said sauer who became mayor in november the reasons 
are the objects of our concentrated efforts low crime rate 
medical facilities parks and recreation weve worked on all of 
it 
sauer and money magazine acknowledged that danbury has its 
problems for example a threebedroom house typically costs 
between 175000 and 250000 
danbury has had other troubles the administration of former 
mayor james e dyer is the target of an fbi probe that resulted in 
the confiscation of city expense and payroll records last year and 
a former parttime probate judge and danbury lawyer allegedly 
embezzled more than 3 million from trust funds under his care 
before committing suicide last year 
but many business owners who have worked and lived here their 
entire lives wouldnt live anywhere else 
mary g cappiello who runs a card shop on main street said she

a big wyoming forest fire edged into yellowstone national park 
on sunday but appeared to be slowing down and firefighters fought 
to keep a separate fire inside the park from burning into idaho 
the south entrance to yellowstone along with the grant village 
hotel and two campgrounds remained closed sunday because of other 
fires in the park but officials stressed that all major park 
attractions remained open 
two fires that burned together over some 10800 acres in 
californias gold rush country were contained saturday and 80 
percent controlled sunday officials said a fire is considered 
contained when a fire break is built around it and controlled when 
it is reduced to smoldering patches 
hot dry weather remained a factor as hundreds of acres of trees 
and brush also burned sunday in smaller fires in parts of 
washington oregon montana colorado and utah 
despite temperatures that reached 94 degrees on the fire lines 
about 210 firefighters sunday afternoon brought a 2420acre blaze 
on the spokane indian reservation in washington under control said 
norm anderson a wenatchee national forest official 
the 22650acre mink creek fire in the bridgerteton national 
forests teton wilderness grew by only 150 acres overnight but it 
crossed the boundary of yellowstone into a rugged backcountry area 
dave steinke a fire information officer said sunday 
it pushed past falcon creek last night and moved just slightly 
into the park probably onequarter of a mile he said we have 
a few spots in the yellowstone meadows area but we have a crew up 
there mopping that up and it looks pretty good on the north end 
a lack of wind during the night helped the fire stay within 
containment lines on its southern end where it was within a few 
miles of private property 
we think its calmed down steinke said he said 737 
firefighters were strengthening firebreaks and mopping up hot spots 
we made very good progress saturday and one reason was that 
we didnt get the predicted adverse weather said dale jarrell 
incident commander also the crews are doing an outstanding 
job 
on the western side of yellowstone a 1300acre blaze 
threatening grizzly bear habitat in the park more than doubled in 
size by nightfall sunday sending a column of smoke more than seven 
miles into the air authorities said 
john quackenbush a helicopter pilot helping dump water on the 
fire said it was one of the biggest columns of smoke he had seen 
in 14 years of such work 
forest service spokesman bruce fox said earlier that 200 
firefighters assisted by nine fire engines a helicopter and two 
bulldozers withdrew to construct a fire line running roughly 
adjacent to the parks boundary to keep the north fork fire from 
crossing into the targhee national forest in eastern idaho 
basically weve decided to allow nature to take its course 
he said 
the blaze began friday about a quarter mile inside the targhee 
and then spread eastward into yellowstone six miles south of the 
point where the idaho montana and wyoming borders meet 
elsewhere in southern idaho in the sawtooth national forest 
southeast of twin falls the poison creek fire was about 40 percent 
contained at more than 2000 acres authorities said 
the fire was threatening a cutthroat and rainbow trout fishery 
along with valuable deer habitat and recently transplanted bighorn 
sheep and wild turkeys 
in california firefighters fought shifting wind high 
temperatures and a threat of lightning sunday in an effort to 
extinquish twin blazes in calaveras county that caused 11 million 
in damages fire crews hoped to put them out by monday night 
were holding our breath waiting to find out what the 
weathers going to do to us said barbara dashiell a spokeswoman 
for the california department of forestry in the mother lode 
community of rail road flat 150 miles east of san francisco 
six homes nine other buildings and eight vehicles have been 
lost since the arsonsuspected blazes broke out tuesday there were 
1700 firefighters and support personnel on hand sunday down from 
a maximum of 3400 friday 
in montana 160 firefighters worked to contain a 250acre blaze 
in the selwaybitterroot wilderness that threatened to spread into 
an area filled with dead and dying trees said deanna riede a 
forest service spokeswoman in missoula 
at least 120 firefighters battled summer heat and wind at a 
blaze that scorched more than 250 acres of brush and timber near 
flaming gorge dam on the utahcolorado border ashley national 
forest spokeswoman merle young said 
its still an uncontrolled fire young said no injuries or 
property damage were reported from the blaze which is believed to

republican george bush after outlining a 22 
billion childcare program designed to help close his gender gap 
with women is turning his attention to selecting a running mate 
the vice president says he expects to have some kind of a 
list of potential running mates prepared by sometime this week 
although he hopes to delay announcing his choice until the gop 
convention next month 
the certain republican presidential candidate was expected to 
spend much of this week mulling over his vice presidential 
selection and had few campaign events scheduled 
meanwhile bush was drawing mixed reviews for his proposal for 
childcare tax credits of up to 1000 per child for lowincome 
families for the neediest families those earning less than 
10000 a year the credit would become a direct government 
payment of the maximum 1000 for each child of four or younger 
bush made the proposal sunday in a speech to the national 
federation of business and professional womens clubs in 
albuquerque nm ending a fiveday burst of campaigning in seven 
states 
it was a gutsy move on the part of the vice president said 
deborah steelman domestic affairs director for bushs presidential 
campaign 
the vice presidents plan was a sharp departure from the reagan 
administrations past policies on child care and bears a price tag 
similar to a 25 billion democratic plan now before congress 
the democratic proposal chiefly sponsored by sen christopher 
dodd dconn which democratic presidential nominee michael 
dukakis has endorsed in concept would provide the money to 
childcare providers instead of to individual families as under the 
bush plan 
betty wray president of the federation to which bush spoke 
called the plan one of the first concrete gestures that the vice 
president has made on issues concerning women 
but she added we know that george bush has a problem right 
now with women voters in this country so until the republican 
party starts to very seriously take a look at those kinds of things 
that are making a difference it could pose real problems 
there are simply not enough republican men to get him bush 
elected without the womans vote she said 
at the conclusion of his speech many members of the audience of 
2500 women chanted era over and over for the equal rights 
amendment which bush opposes and which he did not mention in his 
talk 
we would have liked to have him address the equal rights 
amendment which continues to be this organizations top 
priority federation presidentelect betty forbes said the 
organizations leaders said dukakis and bentsen also had been 
invited to address the convention but had conflicting plans 
there would be no strings attached to how the proposed bush tax 
creditpayment could be spent to qualify at least one adult 
family member would have to be employed 
bush arrived in albuquerque on sunday on air force two with 
former transportation secretary elizabeth hanford dole a 
frequently mentioned vice presidential possibility whose speech to 
the group followed the vice presidents 
mrs dole wife of former gop rival senate republican leader 
bob dole of kansas helped worked on the final draft of bushs 
speech according to her aides 
bush spokeswoman sheila tate said there was no discussion of the 
vice presidential selection process on the plane 
the vice president told reporters that screening of potential 
running mates to look into backgrounds and financial histories 
would begin this week prospective candidates will be asked to fill 
out financial disclosure statements he indicated 
so by sometime next week there will have to be some kind of a 
list he said 
bush told his albuquerque audience his childrens tax credit 
would range up to 1000 per child under age 4 and would be 
refundable meaning families could receive something from the 
government even if they didnt earn enough to pay taxes 
the vice president said the credit would be phased out as income 
rises he gave no details on exactly how this would be done 
background information provided by bushs staff said the tax 
credit would cost 15 billion a year 
bushs fourpoint program also included 
expansion of the existing childcare tax credit to cover more 
lowincome families for a cost of 400 million a year 
creation of workplace childcare centers for all government 
employees and a federally underwritten liability insurance program 
for private centers 50 million a year 
more federal assistance to help states and local governments 
set up programs such as sick child care and beforeandafter school 
care 250 million

president reagan returned from a midsummers 
vacation amid heightened expectations that treasury secretary james 
a baker iii will resign soon to run george bushs presidential 
campaign 
neither baker nor white house officials would confirm publicly 
that baker will be leaving the cabinet soon although presidential 
spokesman marlin fitzwater did not flatly deny it 
given the opportunity sunday to say baker would not leave the 
treasury post fitzwater said only hes still treasury 
secretary put it that way 
but an administration official declining to be named publicly 
said bakers resignation likely will be submitted to reagan in 
early august possibly as soon as next monday with plans to hook 
up with bush in midaugust 
a baker move to the bush campaign would not be shocking since 
there has been speculation for months that the longtime bush 
confidant eventually would move from the treasury department to the 
campaign baker managed bushs unsuccessful run for the gop 
presidential nomination in 1980 
baker accompanied reagan and his wife nancy on the flight from 
california to washington on sunday although the treasury secretary 
was not observed boarding the plane with the reagans at point mugu 
naval air station 
baker evidently had boarded before the contingent of reporters 
arrived to greet the reagans who had flown to the military base 
from their ranch in the santa ynez mountains 
the secretary also spurned a request by a pool of reporters on 
air force one to come chat with them instead he sent back a 
folder that contained a dollar bill baker wrote please note the 
title under the signature is secretary of the treasury 
fitzwater said only that reagan and baker who had been the 
presidents chief of staff from 198185 merely had a very brief 
chat 
an official who discussed the situation on grounds of anonymity 
said the secretary had spoken at a fundraiser saturday night for 
sen pete wilson rcalif and essentially he is hitching a 
ride 
but another official said baker would not have needed to inform 
reagan of his plans on the air force one trip saying the 
secretarys decision to take over the vice presidents campaign had 
been known for some time 
when baker got off the plane at andrews air force base just 
outside washington a reporter asked the secretary can you share 
the news with us 
baker replied theres no news to share 
asked if he had spoken with reagan about quitting baker said he 
had not 
baker has been an unofficial adviser to the bush campaign for 
some time and had accompanied the vice president to wyoming last 
week for a fishing trip 
if baker were to leave it would be the second major cabinet 
change in recent weeks attorney general edwin meese iii a 
longtime reagan friend has resigned effective late this month or 
early next month reagan nominated former pennsylvania gov richard 
thornburgh as meeses replacement 
while reagan vacationed last week at his ranch near santa 
barbara calif senior aides discussed the administrations agenda 
for the remainder of the presidents term 
this week reagan will assess the prospects for new us military 
aid to the nicaraguan rebels a subject that is on the agenda for 
a tuesday morning meeting with republican congressional leaders 
he also plays host wednesday to hungarian premier karoly grosz 
in the first such visit by a highranking hungarian official since 
the country came under communist rule 40 years ago 
since becoming premier in june 1987 grosz has sought improved 
economic and political ties with the west grosz began an 11day 
us tour last week 
reagan will receive an updated report on the drought from 
agriculture secretary richard e lyng who took a 10state tour 
last week the administrations midyear budget review also is due 
this week

as the american people try to figure out 
whether to put mike dukakis in the white house the candidate 
reveals that his daydreams about 1600 pennsylvania avenue leave him 
with a perplexing question 
where do you put the tomato garden 
im trying to figure it out wherever theres full sun 
right he told reporters traveling with him over the weekend 
the massachusetts governor says he grows three varieties of 
tomatoes in his back yard in boston along with some cucumbers and 
peppers he says he worries about them when hes on the campaign 
trail although his neighbor is watering them 
maybe it was the swing through california and north dakota farm 
areas that got him thinking about moving that vegetable garden to 
washington 
it wouldnt be good to cut down any of the famous white house 
trees and dont worry about the rose garden no point planting 
there he says because its too close to the building 
a good tomato garden with cukes peppers has got to be right 
out there in the open right

dukakis is mindful that keeping ahead in the polls sometimes 
requires placing things on your head 
on his first postconvention campaign swing last weekend he 
posed for pictures with a scottish tamoshanter and an assyrian 
headpiece and some baseball caps no doubt before campaigns end 
hell be donning an american indian headdress a cowboy had hard 
hat and others 
although hes not usually a hat man he was taking it all in 
stride until at a rally in erie pa mayor lou tullio showed up 
with the special hat he built for the democratic convention 
the boater had a stuffed animal attached to the top holding up a 
torch sort of like a furry statue of liberty it was the kind of 
hat usually worn only at political conventions last weeks 
featured such beauties as wisconsins cheese hats but tullio has 
been ailing and couldnt make it to atlanta so he obviously 
figured that having the partys new nominee in town was a great 
time to show it off 
but when he brought it out on the stage dukakis made no move to 
touch it looking at it as if the furry thing might bite finally 
tullio balanced it on his own head the crowd cheered with 
approval and dukakis smiled 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
one of the most exciting moments for reporters covering the 
dukakis campaign swing came friday when the press plane landing in 
houston slammed into the runway bounced up and then several 
seconds later landed again 
the secret service which had several of its agents on the 
plane called for an inspection and on saturday it appeared the 
plane would be pulled out of service however repairs were 
completed on time and the press plane continued to follow dukakis 
and running mate lloyd bentsen to minot nd st louis and erie 
pa 
after erie bentsen and wife ba boarded the press charter 
flight back to washington instead of continuing to boston with 
dukakis 
ive heard about this plane mrs bentsen said 
i didnt want to get on this one until we tested it with you 
guys the senator quipped 
meanwhile as the campaign moves into full swing there are 
tentative plans for bentsen to take over dukakis boeing 737 and 
for the governor to charter a larger plane 
bentsen will be inheriting a plane that once was republican bob 
doles campaign jet dukakis had the presidential airways planes 
exterior spruced up and its interior redone with a little office up 
front separated by a curtain from the press and federal agents in 
the back

americans overwhelmingly favor maintaining or 
increasing the federal budget for space exploration even while 
three in 10 doubt nasas competence a media generalassociated 
press poll has found 
the national survey of 1223 adults found that nearly half those 
questioned lost confidence in the national aeronautics and space 
administration after the space shuttle challenger exploded in 
january 1986 and 60 percent of those or 28 percent of all 
questioned say they still lack faith in the agency 
however 40 percent of the respondents said the united states 
was doing too little in space exploration and majorities supported 
the initiatives of building a space station and sending manned 
flights to mars 
the space shuttle program also won support with 40 percent 
saying it should be expanded and as many saying it should be 
maintained the first shuttle flight since the challenger disaster 
is scheduled for september although a leak in a gas line is 
threatening to delay it 
nasa was rated positively overall fiftyfive percent said the 
agency has done a good or excellent job while 37 percent rated it 
only fair or poor 
only 18 percent said the space budget should be decreased while 
almost half said nasas budget should remain the same and 30 
percent said it should be increased of those who favored an 
increase 74 percent said they would be willing to pay higher taxes 
to accomplish it 
the senate this month approved 200 million for nasas space 
station program only enough to phase it out or put it on hold the 
house approved 700 million and a joint committee is to resolve 
the issue 
fear of falling behind in space may be one reason for the 
publics support for nasas funding just 23 percent of respondents 
said the united states is ahead of the soviet union in space 
exploration while the remainder were split on whether the soviets 
are ahead or the two countries are about even 
in any case a plurality of respondents favored superpower 
cooperation in space 49 percent favored last months proposal by 
the soviets for a ussoviet joint effort to send astronauts to 
mars 
fifteen percent said the united states should work alone to 
reach mars together 64 percent favored some program to land 
astronauts on mars while 30 percent were opposed the rest had no 
opinion 
support for a space station was nearly as high with 55 percent 
in favor and 34 percent opposed the rest had no opinion 
on the space shuttle 40 percent said work should be expanded 
and the same number said it should be kept at the same level fewer 
than a fifth said the shuttle program should be cut back 
the poll found a striking split between the sexes with men far 
more likely than women to favor space programs fiftysix percent 
of men said the united states was doing too little in space 
exploration only a quarter of women agreed fortyone percent of 
men supported increasing the space exploration budget compared 
with just 19 percent of women 
overall 40 percent of respondents said the united states was 
doing too little in exploring space and 36 percent said it was 
doing about enough nearly a fifth said the united states was doing 
too much in space exploration the remainder had no opinion 
congress created the nasa 30 years ago to pursue civilian 
exploration of space in recent years the agency increasingly has 
carried military payloads as well a slim plurality in the survey 
opposed that development 48 percent said nasa should be involved 
in nonmilitary projects only while 41 percent approved including 
military work the split was narrowly outside the polls margin of

a house subcommittee has quietly given up the 
idea of transferring strip mine regulators out of the interior 
department 
leaders of the house subcommittee on environment energy and 
natural resources of the government operations committee long 
critical of the departments office of surface mining made the 
decision earlier this month after a discouraging report from the 
general accounting office 
the gao congress research arm said such a move could 
disrupt and destabilize the program for two or more years and 
would not necessarily mean improvements 
rep mike synar dokla the subcommittee chairman and rep 
bill clinger rpa wrote other members that in light of the 
report we think that a transfer at this time is not the way to 
solve the existing problems 
the letter provided last week by subcommittee aides said no 
members had expressed disagreement with the conclusion 
we plan to urge that the incoming administration whether 
republican or democratic give top priority to making the 
fundamental changes necessary synar and clinger said 
a year ago synar asked gao to investigate transferring the 
office of surface mining to some other agency he first raised the 
idea two years ago following a subcommittee report that documented 
difficulties the office had in getting states to enforce their own 
regulations and in collecting fine and penalties 
james duffus iii gao associate director said in a report dated 
june 9 that only one of 16 people consulted from environmental 
groups the coal industry and state governments favored moving the 
office out of interior 
after 10 years of struggle to implement the act stability 
is needed was the consensus 
the dissenter hope babcock of the national audubon society 
argued that moving this function would eliminate the 
institutional conflict that exists at interior between developing 
mineral resources and protecting the environment and would send a 
clear signal to the receiving agency that it should given 
additional attention to the mission of the office duffus 
reported 
babcock said in the report that the environmental protection 
agency should take over the regulatory role because of its 
experience with water pollution and runoff water expertise and 
good reputation as a regulatory agency and experience dealing with 
citizens concerns and involvement in pollution problems 
another view came from former deputy undersecretary of interior 
steve quarles now a staff member at the national academy of 
sciences who suggested grouping all of interiors regulatory 
programs under one assistant secretary 
he said the mining industry did not believe epa would provide 
a proper balance between the acts stated goals of energy 
production and environmental protection 
we have also reported problems in epas management with 
respect to cleaning up hazardous waste and enforcing air 
standards the report said 
the gao also said there would be a long period of adjustment to 
any change 
substantial problems during initial periods of reorganization 
are inevitable such as delays in obtaining key agency 
officials inadequate staffing insufficient funding inadequate 
office space and difficulties in establishing support functions 
such as payroll and accounting systems the report said 
we found that solving these startup problems resulted in 
delays ranging from nine to 30 months and distracted agency 
officials from concentrating on their new missions during the 
critical first year of operations gao said 
alan cole spokesman for the office of surface mining said 
we agree that it would be counterproductive to transfer the 
office to another agency

sitting stiffly and avoiding eye 
contact the leaders of four groups fighting for cambodia began 
their first talks today to try to fashion a political settlement 
their host indonesian foreign minister ali alatas said they 
would discuss such difficult issues as national reconciliation 
forming a provisional government and building a neutral cambodia 
which has been at war almost continuously since 1970 
we of course realize that on these aspects there are 
divergences of views among you and that many years of conflict and 
contention have caused estrangment that may impede a quick 
convergence of positions he said in an opening speech 
alatas said such a complex problem couldnt be solved through a 
single meeting but a solution will never be found unless a start 
is made to replace war with dialogue 
the four cambodian leaders gathered in a chandeliered room in 
the old palace of the late president sukarno for informal 
cocktail party talks that have raised hopes for peace in 
cambodia 
in large easy chairs around a thick circular table sat hun sen 
prime minister of cambodias vietnameseinstalled government and 
leaders of three guerrilla groups opposing him they were khieu 
samphan of the khmer rouge son sann of the khmer peoples national 
liberation front and prince norodom ranariddh who is representing 
his father prince norodom sihanouk 
as they gathered three saffronrobed cambodian buddhist monks 
who had traveled from the united states canada and france filed 
into the palace to pray for success 
vietnam which invaded cambodia in late 1978 and by western 
count maintains more than 100000 troops there was to meet the 
cambodians in a second stage of talks in the afternoon that 
meeting was also to be attended by vietnams communist ally laos 
and by members of the association of southeast asian nations which 
backs the guerrillas 
at a photo session just before the morning talks the leaders 
smiled at photographers and khieu samphan waved but they 
studiously avoided making eye contact with one another 
instead they gazed at huge westernstyle oil paintings on the 
walls 
hun senn and sihanouk have held two previous rounds of talks 
without success and the current meeting represents the first 
gathering of all four cambodia parties 
vietnam has never talked with the cambodian resistance factions 
sihanouk meanwhile was visiting jakarta the indonesian 
capital just 40 miles from bogor but had no known plans to attend 
the talks a indonesian source said the former cambodian monarch 
might make an appearance in bogor depending on progress in the 
talks 
earlier this month sihanouk resigned as president of the 
guerrilla coalition charging the khmer rouge were killing his men 
the tentative schedule called for two days of talks with the 
second day having the same format as the first the cambodian 
factions talking in the morning then the vietnamese and others 
joining in the afternoon 
the talks are based on a july 1987 vietnamindonesia agreement 
that calls for informal discussions to encourage the various 
antagonists to participate and allay vietnams refusal to negotiate 
directly with the guerrillas 
disputes between vietnam and association of southeast asian 
nations delayed the talks which were not confirmed until the last 
minute the association includes the philippines thailand brunei 
malaysia singapore and indonesia 
since 1970 cambodia has suffered a devastating fiveyear civil 
war a reign of terror by the chinesebacked communist khmer rouge 
from 1975 to 1978 a 1978 vietnamese invasion and a continuing 
guerrilla war against the vietnamesebacked government 
millions of people have been killed in the turmoil 
vietnam has announced it will withdraw 50000 troops or about 
half its force in cambodia this year and the rest by early 1990 
though son sann and sihanouk are allied with the khmer rouge in 
a resistance coalition they strongly distrust the khmer rouge 
because it killed hundreds of thousands of people when it ruled 
cambodia

it takes more than 12 hours of 
practice a day under blazing sun or summer rain to get the 
precision right 
but any student who wants to be in the garfield cadets drum and 
bugle corps knows that is the kind of summer 500 will buy 
its a lot like marine corps boot camp said 19yearold 
dennis klophaus a firstyear corps member from jacksonville nc 
the 54yearold corps headquartered in the northern new jersey 
city of garfield is made up of student musicians ages 14 to 21 
from across the united states and canada 
the cadets are the current drum corp international champions 
next month they will try for an unprecedented fifth dci world 
championship as they compete against 70 other corps in kansas city 
until then the garfield cadets who number about 100 will don 
their maroon and offwhite uniforms and strut their stuff across 
eight states and canada as they complete the second half of their 
summer 1988 tour 
the biggest thing that makes them special is the type of 
training said marc sylvester a visual instructor its very 
extreme 
sylvester 30 stands on the bleachers during practice to make 
sure the cadets presentations are pleasing to the eye 
the type of work and pressure they go through is similar to 
what someone in their age group would do when trying out for the 
olympics sylvester said the prestige of winning is like 
winning a gold medal 
george hopkins the groups executive director since 1982 said 
the corps challenges itself by purposely bypassing anything that 
might come easily in favor of the most difficult routines 
if we know that we can do it then we will not do it 
hopkins said 
a day at training camp in this northern new jersey community 
begins at 730 am when the corps rises eats breakfast and 
starts practicing no later than 830 
about 230 pm they eat again they return to practice a half 
hour later dinner is served at 630 pm then the cadets are back 
at work for three more hours 
theyre free until lights out at 11 but often spend the time 
discussing improvements for the routine said tom hawrylko a corps 
spokesman 
all this including bedding down on gymnasium floors costs 
500 which the cadets pay as a membership fee 
i wanted to learn what hard work is and what it does to you 
said firstyear cadet david geltch of washington crossing pa 
its made me concentrate more 
mark poquis a 20yearold baritone horn player from burke va 
said i learned that no matter how downhill and exhausted you 
are you can still push yourself that extra step it builds 
character 
following the cadets from city to city is an 18wheel truck that 
carries food and other supplies another 18wheeler carries the 
instruments along with the streamers and flags for the color 
guard four buses transport the cadets vans carry instructors and 
support staff and a 24foot promotional bus tags along 
like most other drum and bugle corps the garfield cadets raise 
money with cake sales car washes donations and raffles along 
with membership fees the corps has an annual budget of 450000 to 
500000 said gregory pych a member of the board of directors 
this year however the cadets received their first corporate 
sponsorship from k mart stores and emerson radio pych said he 
said exact figures were not available 
besides becoming better musicians the cadets are taught good 
competitive manners sylvester said 
you never are a sore loser or an obnoxious winner he said

the secret service is opposing a request from 
st elizabeths hospital to allow presidential assailant john 
hinckley jr to leave the mental institution for a supervised day 
trip with other patients 
we dont believe he should be released under any conditions 
secret service spokesman rich adams said saturday we believe him 
to be a threat to our protectees and will continue to believe that 
theres nothing thats been shown to us to indicate hes any 
different 
hinckley was committed to the hospital in 1982 after he was 
found innocent by reason of insanity in the shooting of president 
reagan white house press secretary james brady a secret service 
agent and a dc policeman 
city mental health officials said a review board at st 
elizabeths has approved hinckleys participation in an outing to a 
museum park or other public place 
but federal prosecutors have asked a judge to hold a hearing on 
the proposed day trip the last time st elizabeths sought 
permission for an offgrounds activity for hinckley was last year 
but the request was dropped after it was disclosed that hinckley 
had corresponded with theodore bundy a convicted serial killer

a government agency is touting a new strain of 
corn as a potential source of protein for children in the third 
world 
the national research council calls the new corn qpm for 
qualityprotein maize because it contains about twice the usable 
protein of ordinary varieties maize is the international word for 
corn 
a small research team working for 10 years developed qpm at 
the same laboratories where nobel peace prize winner norman e 
borlaug produced the new wheat varieties that brought the green 
revolution in the 1950s 
the report suggests distributing qpm in areas that already 
depend heavily on corn to feed small children south america 
central america most of africa bangladesh indonesia and the 
philippines 
maize is often the crop of the poor and in the maizegrowing 
areas of the world millions of children living in poverty are not 
thriving says the report of a panel appointed by the council 
here is an opportunity to explore this new approach to relieving 
an intolerable situation

soviet military officials have told their us 
counterparts that toplevel talks between the nations militaries 
might resolve technical problems that are roadblocks to agreement 
on conventional force reductions according to a published report 
the washington post reported today that the soviet unions top 
defense officials during a recent sixday tour of the united 
states said the military contacts might lead to a formula for 
reduction that has eluded civilian arms negotiators because it 
would be based on a joint military assessment of what constitutes 
equal strength 
the paper quoted sources as saying that soviet marshal sergei 
akhromeyev told adm william j crowe jr chairman of the joint 
chiefs of staff that equal strength need not mean onetoone 
equality in the numbers of arms and equipment because of 
technological and structural differences between the two militaries 
crowe and akhromeyev spent hours explaining to each other their 
basic military doctrines and the fears they have about each other 
the post said they agreed the paper quoted crowe as saying last 
week that there are two problems to be overcome mistrust and 
the difference in the structures of our two militaries 
the discussions between crowe and akhromeyev have enabled the 
pair to form a personal relationship similar to one that has 
developed between defense secretary frank c carlucci and soviet 
defense minister dmitri yazov according to the post 
next week carlucci will travel to the soviet union for his 
third round of private meetings with yazov the two already have 
spent nearly 14 hours together discussing similar questions of 
doctrine and forces first in bern last march and then during the 
may summit in moscow 
at akhromeyevs invitation crowe is planning a trip to the 
soviet union sometime next year

jesse jackson quietly ended his dramatic week in 
atlanta saying his mission now is to help mike dukakis win the 
white house this year 
my focus now is on the fall campaign he told reporters as 
he left a downtown atlanta hotel saturday well be spending a 
lot of time organizing for voter registration issue 
interpretation involving people many for the first time and a 
big turnout for the fall campaign 
jackson who finished second to dukakis in his second race for 
the presidency would not talk about whether he would make a third 
run for national office 
well have to determine what will happen based on the outcome 
of the campaign but we take this journey one phase at a time he 
said 
jackson took members of his family campaign staffers and 
journalists who covered his bid for the democratic presidential 
nomination to paschals a wellknown blackowned hotel and 
restaurant for lunch then left from fulton county airport in a 
chartered jet 
jacksons relaxed departure was a marked contrast to the 
motorcade of buses he took to atlanta july 16 two days before the 
start of the democratic convention 
he addressed thousands of cheering supporters in piedmont park 
that day asserting that dukakis then assured of the nomination 
must give jackson a stronger voice in the party 
jackson said saturday his campaign made great gains in atlanta 
he said blacks and others previously outside the party 
mainstream will have unprecedented involvement in the fall 
campaign and he noted that several jackson platform positions were 
adopted 
we can leave atlanta with a real sense of inspiration because 
of the expansion of the democratic party more inclusion 
involvement in the campaign at all levels vertically and 
horizontally he said

the spiritual leader of proiranian 
shiite moslem extremists believed to be holding foreigners hostage 
in lebanon has called for a new approach to the crisis that would 
bring a happy ending 
sheikh mohammed hussein fadlallah the spiritual leader of 
hezbollah or party of god made the comments just as iran prepared 
to enter unsponsored talks to end its 8yearold war with iraq 
fadlallah in a sermon sunday accused the united states and 
europe of using the hostage crisis for political purposes but he 
also called for a swift resolution to the problem 
we call for a just and practical solution to this problem to 
achieve a happy ending he said 
we are aware that the hostages problem has reached such a 
degree of complexity that its political aspect has become mixed up 
with its humanitarian aspect 
hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella for the militant shiite 
factions holding most of the 18 foreigners missing in lebanon nine 
americans are among the captives 
fadlallahs comments came during a onehour sermon to shiite 
zealots marking the major moslem feast of aladha in south beiruts 
bir elabed mosque 
the hostages are widely believed to be held in hezbollahs hay 
madi barracks building about ten blocks from mosque in beiruts 
southern suburbs a shiite stronghold 
syria has had some 5000 troops patrolling most of the southern 
suburbs since may 27 but they have stayed away from the immediate 
area of the barracks apparently to avert a military confrontation 
that could imperil the hostages 
syrian soldiers however control all approaches to hay madi and 
man highrise apartment buildings overlooking the barracks 
it was not clear whether fadlallahs call signaled a 
breakthrough for the hostages he has made similar calls during the 
past two years with no results 
on the occasion of this feast we call on all sides to begin 
acting in a political sphere so that the humanitarian aspect of 
this problem could be resolved he said 
we feel pain for the detention of the hostages because the 
issue has humanitarian aspects fadlallah said 
fadlallah accused the united states and european nations of 
manipulating the issue of the hostages for political reasons to 
impose their dominance on the world 
america has not moved to fight terrorism but has rather used 
it as a means of political pressure on each country and people that 
resist its imperlialist policies he added 
it was fadlallahs first reference to the hostages issue since 
iran announced july 18 that it was accepting the yearold un 
security council resolution calling for a ceasefire in its war 
with iraq 
political observers believe a truce in the war could facilitate 
efforts for the release of the hostages 
nine americans are among the 18 hostages the longest held is 
terry anderson 40 chief mmiddle eeast correspondent for the 
associated press who was seized march 16 1985 
andersons sister peggy say reached by telephone sunday at her 
home in cadiz ky said i dont see that it the holding of 
hostages should be a political issue its a human issue 
everything ive been hearing out of the middle east lately 
gives us reason to hope and its been a very very long time since 
weve had occasion to be hopeful

a federal agencys decision to allow aids patients 
to import treatment drugs that have not been approved for sale in 
this country gives new hope to victims of the deadly disease a 
homosexual rights activist said 
dr frank e young commissioner of the us food and drug 
administration announced the change saturday during an address at 
a conference here on homosexual health issues 
young said the government officially began allowing importation 
of some unapproved treatments of acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome wednesday 
the decision allows aids patients to make some choices about 
their own treatment said ellen ratner president of the national 
lesbian and gay health foundation which sponsored the conference 
if youre dying you dont have a lot of choices 
a harvard school of public health attorney who researches 
worldwide aids policies agreed 
from the aids persons point of view they have nothing to 
lose and what they need is just some little optimism in their 
life the attorney larry gostin said sunday if theres a 
risk i think that they should be able to make the decision about 
whether to assume that risk 
he called the program a signal advance in recognizing the gay 
and ivdrug constituencies that have been calling for this 
intravenous drug users along with homosexual males are the 
primary sufferers from aids 
its almost a shock because its so contrary to the character 
and the tradition of the fda gostin said 
psychologist winfield scott associate dean for education at 
george washington university medical center said the change 
responds to the frustration felt by homosexuals that aids 
answers arent coming more quickly 
i am a gay person myself but i think that the frustration 
focuses on the bureaucracy as though the ultimate obstacles were in 
the bureaucracy scott said the real problem is that nature is 
very slow and reluctant to yield up her secrets 
scott said he believes aids patients desire for experimental 
drugs can be balanced with scientists reluctance to use the drugs 
if the patients give up the right to sue if things go badly 
young and other fda officials said that such unapproved drugs as 
dextran sulfate and ribavirin have been allowed into the country on 
an informal basis 
the new policy sets a formal procedure for those who certify 
that the drug is for their own use small amounts will be allowed 
generally enough for three months of treatment as an assurance 
that the drug is not intended for sale 
ribavirin is an antiviral drug that can be purchased in japan 
and mexico 
dextran sulfate developed as a blood thinner has been used in 
japan for about 20 years to lower cholesterol and other fats in the 
blood some laboratory reports have indicated it deters the aids 
virus 
young said the fda maintains the right to deny any shipments 
into the county it changed its policy in part because some aids 
treatments were coming in as contraband 
all of us are dealing with a time line that is fierce young 
said 
he said some of the drugs have been shown to help combat the 
disease which is spread most often through sexual contact needles 
shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products and from 
pregnant women to their offspring 
despite the change some still accused the government of failing 
to do enough to permit the use of drugs to help treat aids victims 
he announced the policy because he heard there were going to 
be protests and he wanted to placate us said debbie levine of 
the new yorkbased aids coalition to unleash power but were not 
going to be placated with just dribs and drabs 
homosexual or bisexual males account for 62 percent of the 
68220 us aids cases counted by the government since june 1981 
there have been 38541 deaths or 56 percent of total cases the 
centers for disease control reported last week

garcia said the three were madrinas underlings who work 
illegally for members of the elite federal force

highest police agency and carry automatic weapons often have 
little or no training

officers they will face charges of usurpation of police powers as

ethnic armenians in the disputed nagornokarabakh 
region went back to tending fields driving buses and building 
homes today after their twomonth strike failed to bring unity with 
armenia staterun media reported 
an end to the latest strike in the predominantly armenian 
enclave of the southern republic of azerbaijan would signal a step 
toward normalcy for an area in tumult since february 
still a resident in stepanakert nagornokarabakhs capital 
said some of the regions 162000 people will press on with the 
annexation campaign 
today people went to work transport is operating and we have 
ended our strikes reported the engineer for the state 
broadcasting committee she declined to give her name 
the situation is still very tense she said by telephone 
the decision has done little for us and we will continue this 
fight to the end but what is the sense of continuing to strike 
the kremlin leadership decided a week ago that nagornokarabakh 
will remain part of the azerbaijan which has ruled it since 1923 
nagornokarabhs armenians predominantly christian like their 
brethren in the neighboring armenian republic have waged a vocal 
campaign for annexation they contend they suffer discrimination 
under the azeris most of whom are moslem 
the annexation drive was opposed by the azerbaijani leadership 
and the struggle over control of nagornokarabakh has fueled ethnic 
tensions in the caucasus 
mass demonstrations by armenians in nagornokarabakh and the 
armenian capital of yerevan have drawn hundreds of thousands of 
people and on feb 28 the unrest became violent when 26 armenians 
and six other people were killed in the azerbaijani city of sumgait 
after moscows rejection of the annexation bid became known in 
yerevan last week activists called for a fiveday protest strike 
but most residents heeded official warnings against prolonging the 
labor unrest 
strikes continued in nagornokarabakh through the weekend but 
staterun radio moscow reported today that most workers in the 
region had decided to end the stoppage 
neither radio moscow nor the engineer reached in stepanakert 
explained why residents decided to return to work and other calls 
to the region did not go through 
the official news agency tass reported that the armenian 
communist party leadership met sunday and that local officials were 
blamed for allowing the annexation drive to get out of hand 
party leaders said the situation that has shaped in the 
republic over the recent months has been a result of gross 
miscalculations and errors in the political organizational and 
ideological work of party committees of primary party 
organizations tass said 
adhering to the tougher stance against ethnic strife outlined by 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev in a speech a week ago tass 
said the armenian party leadership failed to sense the political 
danger of unjustifiable calls for revision of the existing 
nationalterritorial structure 
pravda the partys central newspaper also criticized armenian 
party leaders who took up the cause of annexing the region calling 
for review and rectification of their political immaturity

a negotiating session between striking 
scriptwriters and producers recessed early today after nearly 13 
hours but more talks to end the 20weekold strike were scheduled 
union officials said 
the session between the striking writers guild of america began 
about 130 pm sunday at the sherman oaks headquarters of the 
alliance of motion picture and television producers and was 
monitored by a federal mediator 
the talks recessed at 215 am today but were scheduled to 
resume at 3 pm said cheryl rhoden a guild spokeswoman 
we went to the meeting prepared to negotiate in good faith in 
order to reach a fair deal to both sides brian walton executive 
director of the guilds west coast unit said in a taped message to 
members were committed to do that and to continue the process 
the session that ended early today followed a 13hour round of 
talks saturday that was the first time the two sides had conducted 
formal talks in more than a month 
guild president george kirgo said union negotiators were 
prepared for any new development that may arise but refused to 
elaborate citing a news blackout agreed upon by both sides at the 
request of federal mediator leonard farrell 
previous talks ended in june with scriptwriters coasttocoast 
overwhelmingly rejecting a compromise offer from producers 
since the strike began march 7 the main sticking point has been 
the share of money writers make when hourlong television shows go 
into reruns 
despite some internal dissention the 9000plus member guild 
has remained firm in its demand for a bigger cut of the socalled 
residual profits and has divided producers ranks by getting some 
independent filmmakers to defect allowing them to hire writers 
under separate contracts granting guild demands 
the strike has slowed down the entertainment industry and 
resulted in layoffs 
television networks their fall schedules in shambles have 
insisted they will broadcast new fall programming even if they have 
to refilm old scripts with new actors

president corazon aquino today said 
the 19yearold communist insurgency is finally losing steam and 
declared that the rebels rejection of peace gives her government 
the moral basis for war 
this may be remembered as the year the insurgency was 
broken mrs aquino told congress in a nationally televised 
state of the nation address 
as the president spoke about 3000 leftists rallied at a 
downtown square about six miles away and burned placards showing 
her wearing military fatigues 
speakers claimed the government had failed to live up to its 
promises of land reform and social justice 
for the armed left it has been a year of defeats and 
retreats a year of propaganda by terror rather than the strategic 
initiative of which it had boasted mrs aquino said 
she made no direct reference to a call this month by the 
catholic bishops conference of the philippines to resume peace 
talks which collapsed in january 1987 
the president vowed her government would keep open the door of 
reconciliation but added the rejection of our peace efforts 
restored to government the moral basis for war 
i wish we could still pursue the path of peace she added 
yet until the rebels and their friends come to trust their 
doctrines to the ballot box rather than the rifle government has 
no choice but to defend our people with the gun 
last week mrs aquino said she was willing to resume peace 
talks but only if the rebels request them first the general 
command of the 25000member new peoples army rejected the call 
saying the government simply wants to entrap guerrilla leaders 
during the address mrs aquino said democracy is beating back 
the challenge of the totalitarian left 
she called on congress to pursue an agenda to alleviate foreign 
debt improve education create new jobs and reduce poverty 
mrs aquino claimed that in the past year government troops 
captured five members of the communist party central committee 19 
staff officers 397 regulars and killed about 2000 party members 
the leftist peoples party in a statement issued before the 
speech said the presidents remarks were simply an apology to 
the nation 
the real state of the nation is lived with each passing day 
the party said it is experienced by each hungry family it is 
witnessed by each hungry family it is witnessed by each 
negotiation selling out to the us bases and it is echoed by each 
cry of protest that is snuffed out by bullets 
opposition rep salvador escuerdo said mrs aquinos optimisic 
assessment of the counterinsurgency campaign shows she is not 
receiving realistic reports from the military 
im a bit worried that mrs aquino is not getting the correct 
data from her officials in the department of national defense 
escuerdo said without peace and order we cannot really hope for 
an economic miracle or recovery 
on saturday the philippine daily globe said a classified 
military report prepared in may showed government forces lost 66 of 
the 67 major battles against the new peoples army during the first 
three months of the year 
the newspaper also said the report showed that rebel strength in 
manila had grown to 2700 the highest number since the insurgency 
began in december 1968 
chief military spokesman col oscar florendo admitted that the 
newspaper account was based on an internal classified report but 
said its findings were purely tactical and incomplete

gretchen schulte has gone the way of many 
disgruntled workers declaring a strike a picket line and erecting 
protest placards against unfair labor practices 
cooking cleaning laundry sewing and driving her children to 
summer activities were among the tasks she refused to do during her 
walkout which appears to be entering its second week today 
mrs schulte 42 said shes protesting her motherly duties 
because she felt she was being taken for granted 
her husband theodore pitched in and helped her with the signs 
that were draped on the front porch 
the family could not be reached sunday by telephone but the 
protest placards were still in view and mrs schulte said saturday 
during an interview she would pursue her walkout at least through a 
second week 
neighbors said the schultes appeared to be away for the day 
leading to speculation that some heavy collective bargaining might 
be going on 
handpainted signs on the front of the frame dwelling read 
mom on strike and union labor teenagers 
i dont expect it to change overnight mrs schulte said 
saturday im going to last another week but if it goes another 
month i dont really care 
a cardboard fence marked a picket line serving notice to her 
four children to use the back door 
i became too much of a mother too much of a chauffeur she 
said i just began doing too much for them and they werent 
giving me anything there was constant squabbling about making 
beds and doing dishes she said 
i said i dont have enough money to go to a counselor and 
these things are too small anyway but if i let them go im going 
to have a lot of problems she said 
she and her husband made signs that were posted inside the 
house when the children only thought it was cool she decided 
to go public 
the campaign began july 18 with no meals no money from mothers 
pocket for milk and no rides to work their telephone was 
disconnected television and radio were taken to strike 
headquarters in the parents bedroom 
no teenager friends were allowed to cross the picket line 
schulte said he supported his wife 100 percent and was acting as 
strike mediator 
the children twins heidi and eric 14 julie 13 and jerry 8 
gave the strike mixed reviews 
i feel embarrassed because everyone is asking me about it 
heidi said but were going to have to make a change because we 
dont want her on strike anymore she has a point but i think she 
went about it the wrong way 
jerry who promised to spend an afternoon making his bed and 
cleaning his room the living room and the bathroom said some 
people are saying good for mom 
i say good for mom too 
by the weekend mrs schulte reported progress but that talks 
had yet to produce a settlement 
i love them mrs schulte said of her children i just 
want them to look at themselves and see that they dont have it so 
tough at my house when they start doing these things ill go off 
strike 
meanwhile she said im having the time of my life

vietnam which once called the situation 
in cambodia irreversible held its first peace talks today with 
leaders of three guerrilla groups fighting its decadeold 
occupation of that country 
foreign minister nguyen co thach of vietnam searched for 
compromise in an opulent reception room at the late president 
sukarnos summer palace with the guerrilla leaders and foreign 
ministers of noncommunist nations that back them 
the informal cocktail party talks werent confirmed until 
the last minute but they have raised hopes for ending a monotonous 
cycle of dashed diplomatic moves followed by bloody fighting in 
cambodias malarial jungles 
vietnam maintains more than 100000 troops in cambodia to 
support a government it installed after invading the country on 
christmas day 1978 
around tables arranged in a circle sat thach hun sen prime 
minister of the vietnameseinstalled government a representative 
of vietnams communist ally laos and the guerrilla leaders khieu 
samphan of the communist khmer rouge son sann of the khmer 
peoples national liberation front and prince norodom ranariddh 
who is representing his father prince norodom sihanouk 
the guerrillas are grouped in a resistance coalition that the 
united nations recognizes as cambodias legitimate government 
foreign minister ali alatas of host indonesia moderated the 
talks also attended by senior foreign ministry officials of the 
other members of the association of southeast asian nations 
thailand malaysia the philippines singapore and brunei 
the association has called vietnams occupation of cambodia the 
regions major security threat during the past decade 
the parties all sat quietly in the carpeted doublechandeliered 
room as waves of journalists and photographers were rushed in for a 
glimpse thach appeared bemused and the affable alatas chatted and 
tried to ease some of the stiffness of the first encounter 
no definite schedule has been fixed for the duration of the 
talks 
for years thach was a tough hardliner who knew only the 
language of defiance over the past 1 years however he has 
vigorously pushed for dialogue as vietnams pragmatic new 
leadership focuses on economic development which it admits 
requires an end to the international isolation cambodia has caused 
hanoi 
for years the association of southeast asian nations has 
encouraged the guerrillas to force vietnam out of cambodia 
the association became more anxious for talks as vietnam began 
withdrawing large numbers of troops and pledged a total pullout by 
early 1990 suggesting it fears the pullout may leave cambodia with 
a much more chaotic and bloodier civil war 
earlier today the cambodian factions held their own separate 
talks the first time they had ever gathered together 
alatas has outlined the formidable task the parties face they 
have to find common ground on powersharing selfdetermination 
national reconciliation the withdrawal of vietnamese troops and 
cambodias future 
hun senn and sihanouk have held two rounds of talks without 
success in the past and todays gathering represented the first 
meeting among all four cambodia parties 
sihanouk meanwhile was visiting jakarta the indonesian 
capital just 40 miles from bogor but had no known plans to attend 
the talks an indonesian source said the former cambodian monarch 
might make an appearance in bogor depending on progress in the 
talks 
earlier this month sihanouk resigned as president of the 
guerrilla coalition charging the khmer rouge was killing his men 
the talks are based on a july 1987 vietnamindonesia agreement 
that calls for informal discussions to encourage the various 
antagonists to participate and allay vietnams refusal to negotiate 
directly with the guerrillas 
disputes between vietnam and association of southeast asian 
nations delayed the talks which were not confirmed until the last 
minute the association includes the philippines thailand brunei 
malaysia singapore and indonesia 
since 1970 cambodia has suffered a devastating fiveyear civil 
war a reign of terror by the chinesebacked communist khmer rouge 
from 1975 to 1978 a 1978 vietnamese invasion and a continuing 
guerrilla war against the vietnamesebacked government 
millions of people have been killed in the turmoil 
vietnam has announced it will withdraw 50000 troops or about 
half its force in cambodia this year and the rest by early 1990 
though son sann and sihanouk are allied with the khmer rouge in 
a resistance coalition they strongly distrust the khmer rouge 
because it killed hundreds of thousands of people when it ruled 
cambodia

parties that formed prime minister prem 
tinsulanondas last coalition government won 58 percent of the vote 
in a general election but analysts predicted today that prems 
probable return to power will be beset by discord 
the new government will face the same difficult problems it 
endured under prems last administration because there is growing 
and open resentment of and opposition to prem said political 
scientist somboon suksamran of bangkoks chulalongkorn university 
since no proprem party scored a majority in sundays polling 
the next government will again have to be made up of several 
parties in prems last government frictions among coalition 
partners proved troublesome 
somboon and other political analysts predicted that prem if he 
is returned to power probably would not finish his fouryear term 
without dissolving parliament or stepping down 
prem has served as prime minister since 1980 having dissolved 
parliament twice survived two attempted coups and formed five 
different cabinets 
a host of domestic pressures have been mounting including 
weakened support from the powerful military sharp criticism from 
opposition parties and recent labor and student protests 
these pressures will only get more intense and will very 
likely force prem to make big decisions on whether he should cling 
to his office somboon told the associated press 
but the head of chart thai thai nation party which polled the 
most votes in the countrys 17th general election said his party 
would support prems continuation as prime minister 
chatichai choonhavan told reporters today that a gentlemens 
agreement had been made among the four coalition partners to back 
prem 
the wellfinanced chart thai won 87 seats in the 357seat house 
of representatives while coalition partners accumulated another 
123 the social action party took 54 democrat party 48 and 
rassadorn citizens party 21 seats 
the strongest parties and other power centers in thailand in 
coming days are expected to engage in intense politicking and 
bargaining before the next coalition is forged and a prime minister 
named 
the candidate who emerges must also be approved by thailands 
powerful constitutional monarch bhumibol adulyadej 
interior minister prachuab soontrangkul announced that 169 
million out of an eligible 266 million voters turned out for the 
election 
the voting was marred by a grenade attack against a local 
politician in which two persons were killed and six others wounded 
officials also said moslem separatists set fire to nine rural 
schools a health clinic and a rest house in the southern province 
of narathiwat in an apparent attempt to disrupt the elections some 
of the schools were used as polling stations 
a total of 3606 candidates from 16 political parties contested 
the seats in the lower house of parliament 
among the opposition groups the prachakorn thai thai citizens 
party led with 31 seats and the newly formed palang dharma the 
power of virtue captured 14 
prem called the election 24 months early after he dissolved 
parliament april 29 disbanding his coalition government and 
nullifying a noconfidence motion tabled by his increasingly vocal 
opposition 
the 67yearold former army chief has maintained silence over 
whether he would accept another term but most analysts believe he 
would 
thai elections are largely centered on personalities not 
political platforms and the main contention has been whether prem 
should return or not 
some people call the lowkey prime minister papa prem 
others criticize him as boring quick to compromise and slow to 
tackle national problems 
but prem the longestserving prime minister in modern thai 
history has given the country a needed stability after years of 
coups and attempted power grabs 
although his coalition has been beset by factionalism he 
remains favored by three powerful institutions the military 
bureaucracy and constitutional monarchy

the spiritual leader of proiranian 
shiite moslem extremists believed to be holding foreigners hostage 
in lebanon has called for a new approach to the crisis that would 
bring a happy ending 
sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah the spiritual leader of 
hezbollah or party of god made the comments in a sermon sunday as 
iran prepared to enter unsponsored talks to end its 8yearold 
war with iraq 
fadlallah accused the united states and europe of using the 
hostage crisis for political purposes but he also called for a 
swift resolution to the problem 
we call for a just and practical solution to ths problem to 
achieve a happy ending he said 
we are aware that the hostages problem has reached such a 
degree of complexity that its political aspect has become mixed up 
with its humanitarian aspect 
hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella for shiite factions 
holding most of the 18 foreigners missing in lebanon nine 
americans are among the captives 
fadlallahs comments came during a onehour sermon to shiites 
marking the major moslem feast of aladha in south beiruts bir 
elabed mosque 
the hostages are widely believed to be held in hezbollahs hay 
madi barracks building about 10 blocks from the mosque in beiruts 
southern suburbs 
syria has had some 5000 troops patrolling most of the southern 
suburbs since may 27 but they have stayed away from the immediate 
area of the barracks apparently to avert a military confrontation 
that could imperil the hostages 
syrian soldiers however control all approaches to hay madi and 
man highrise apartment buildings overlooking the barracks 
it was not clear whether fadlallahs call signaled a 
breakthrough for the hostages he has made similar statements in 
the past two years with no results 
on the occasion of this feast we call on all sides to begin 
acting in a political sphere so that the humanitarian aspect of 
this problem could be resolved he said 
we feel pain for the detention of the hostages because the 
issue has humanitarian aspects fadlallah said 
he accused the united states and european nations of 
manipulating the issue of the hostages for political reasons to 
impose their dominance on the world 
america has not moved to fight terrorism but has rather used 
it as a means of political pressure on each country and people that 
resist its imperlialist policies he added 
it was fadlallahs first reference to the hostages issue since 
iran announced july 18 that it was accepting the yearold un 
security council resolution calling for a ceasefire in its war 
with iraq 
political observers believe a truce could facilitate efforts for 
the release of the hostages 
defense secretary frank c carlucci appearing on the nbcs 
meet the press said sunday that improved usiranian 
relations could lead to the release of the american hostages 
on the terms of a release carlucci said were obviously not 
going to discuss any quid pro quo but if the iranians want to talk 
to us about the hostage situation and how theyre going to go about 
influencing their release wed be delighted to talk to them about 
it im not in the slightest suggesting that there would be any 
deal for the hostages that is contrary to our policy 
we have consistently said that were prepared to enter into a 
dialogue with iran carlucci said all they have to do is 
designate somebody who is officially empowered to talk to us and 
wed be glad to talk with them about policy issues about 
terrorism about bringing peace to the region about whatever is 
appropriate 
the longest held hostages is terry anderson 40 chief middle 
eeast correspondent for the associated press who was seized march 
16 1985 
andersons sister peggy say reached by telephone sunday at her 
home in cadiz ky said i dont see that it the holding of 
hostages should be a political issue its a human issue 
everything ive been hearing out of the middle east lately 
gives us reason to hope and its been a very very long time since 
weve had occasion to be hopeful

horse feed was told his porker may be killed if it isnt picked up

brown and a computer check showed he was wanted for violating 
probation on a charge of driving under the influence of alcohol 
blackie slipped out of browns arms and made a clean getaway 
officer gary yost and another officer spent the next few hours 
pursuing blackie until a member of the sheriffs office 
agricultural unit was called in for assistance 
deputy jack hiho hrabovsky used a handful of horse feed to 
stop and capture blackie who was sent off to a sheriffs office 
facility 
sheriffs office spokesman jack espinosa said he was not sure 
what the guidelines on animals called for but he noted that in 
many livestock cases the animals were kept for a specific time and 
then auctioned 
the last thing i heard was that this was a pet that we 
have his pet and that we would keep the pig until it is claimed 
he said 
browns mother said her son who has always liked pigs received 
blackie from a friend as payment for a plumbing job she said he 
intended to give the pig to relatives who live on a farm

a soviet general says he doubts afghan troops can 
survive when the red army withdraws from afghanistan he also 
predicts that islamic fundamentalists will seize power 
the statements by maj gen kim m tsagolov who was once an 
adviser to the afghans represent a break with moscows official 
line 
in an interview with the weekly ogonyok magazine tsagolov says 
afghanistans ruling party is hopelessly disorganized plagued by 
corruption and has bungled opportunities to make peace with 
insurgents he also accuses the soviet media of exaggerating soviet 
and afghan military victories 
the interview appeared in the magazines july 30 issue which 
subscribers received sunday 
western military and political analysts have said for some time 
they doubt the afghan army can fight off usbacked rebels on its 
own they have predicted a collapse of the communist afghan 
government in kabul after the soviet pullout is completed next year 
tsagolov who teaches philosophy at a military academy is 
believed to be the first soviet official to make similar 
predictions publicly 
ogonyok has led the campaign for glasnost or greater openness 
on selected topics 
the official soviet line has held that afghan government forces 
are well prepared to defend their country lt gen boris gromov 
commander of soviet forces in afghanistan told reporters in moscow 
last month that the afghan government has created an effective 
fighting force 
asked if he is confident afghan forces can provide adequate 
defense from rebel attacks after a soviet withdrawal tsagolov told 
ogonyok if you judge the afghan army by its current state then 
i dont have the confidence about which you speak 
the soviet union began withdrawing its troops from afghanistan 
may 15 under the terms of a unbrokered accord half of the more 
than 100000 troops must be out by midaugust and the rest by feb 
15 
the official tass news agency said saturday that more than 
35000 soldiers have been withdrawn meanwhile kabul is coming 
under increasing guerrilla artillery fire 
president najib of afghanistan says he is counting on the 
continued help of soviet advisers for his 50000 regular army 
troops after the kremlins forces are gone he has said his forces 
can defend the country as long as outside assistance to the rebels 
is stopped 
tsagolov noted that afghan forces even when backed by soviet 
troops have made little headway in capturing rebelheld territory 
he said official soviet press reports exaggerated military 
victories and suffered from a deficit of truth about how tough 
the combat was 
the aghan army is weak he said because the ruling peoples 
democratic party and the government lack popular support and have 
underestimated the threat of the armed opposition he recommended 
the government devote massive resources to building up the army 
asked what the situation would be like when the soviet 
withdrawal is completed he predicted activization of the islamic 
factor 
in the future its quite possible that islamic 
fundamentalists will appear he said 
some afghan guerrillas want to establish an islamic 
fundamentalist state 
tsagolov said the afghan leadership had been insensitive to 
religion and thereby alienated much of the population drawing them 
to the opposition 
he said najibs policy of national reconciliation an attempt to 
bring opponents into the government has failed even though 
internal opponents are tired of war willing to engage in dialogue 
and hostile to the sevenparty afghan guerrilla alliance based in 
pakistan 
this also can be considered a lost opportunity of the kabul 
leadership tsagolov said 
he said the ruling afghan party is split into factions pays 
little attention to peoples needs and is plagued by bureaucracy 
and bribery 
i fear that the disease of fractional battle and system of 
clans in the party has gone too far tsagolov said 
soviet troops entered afghanistan in december 1979 to help the 
sovietbacked kabul government fight the rebels 
the kremlin says 13310 soviet soldiers have been killed in the 
war 35500 have been wounded and more than 300 are missing in 
action 
tass reported today that since may rebel forces have bombarded 
kabul with 178 rockets and 30 mines killing 154 people and 
wounding 205 in the afghan capital

a top defense official said today that the crew of 
a navy submarine that hit and sank a chartered fishing boat should 
have done more to rescue the 48 people on board and had been slow 
in notifying rescue officials 
divers meanwhile recovered the bodies of three more victims 
bringing the confirmed death toll to nine in the accident saturday 
near yokosuka 28 miles southwest of tokyo 
about 200 divers were searching today for the bodies of 21 
people missing and presumed dead rescue officials said other 
divers worked to attach cables to the hull of the sunken fishing 
vessel the 154ton no 1 fujimaru officials said they plan to 
begin raising the ship with a giant crane tuesday 
witnesses said the fishing boat which had been chartered by a 
company club for a weekend trip sank less than two minutes after 
colliding with the 2200ton submarine nadashio at the entrance to 
tokyo bay the submarine traveling on the surface was crossing a 
busy shipping lane to enter yokosuka naval base 
nineteen people were rescued from the boat one of them died 
later in a hospital 
the investigation isnt complete yet but it looks like both 
vessels were partly responsible for the accident an official of 
the maritime safety agency japans coast guard said 
there were no reports of injuries among the 75 men aboard the 
submarine which was only slightly damaged 
seiki nishihiro vice minister of state for defense said the 
submarine had been slow in notifying rescue officials of the 
accident because its communications equipment allowed it to talk to 
naval headquarters but not directly to the coast guard 
news reports said 21 minutes elapsed before the coast guard was 
informed of the collision of the 19 people who were rescued 16 
were picked up by other passing ships and only three by the 
submarine the reports said 
nishihiro said he wished members of the crew had grabbed three 
or four life preservers if they were available and jumped into 
the water to save the people in the ocean 
witnesses from other boats said they saw a number of people who 
had been floating in the water after the accident sink out of sight 
admiral shuichiro higashiyama navy chief of staff was quoted 
as saying sunday that the submarine was trying to avoid hitting a 
yacht when it rammed the fishing boat and that the accident could 
have been avoided if the fishing boat had not made an unexpected 
turn 
if the no 1 fujimaru had not turned to the left there would 
not have been a collision i dont know why they turned i believe 
the submarine commander took the most appropriate measures to avoid 
an accident a navy official quoted him as saying 
according to japanese maritime regulations the vessel 
approaching from the left when two boats are on a collision course 
must take evasive action while the other vessel must maintain its 
direction unless an accident is imminent 
in saturdays accident the submarine was on the left 
higashiyama said 
the collision was the worst involving japanese navy vessels and 
civilian boats since world war ii defense officials said it was 
the first collision in japan between a submarine and a japanese 
civilian ship since 1981 when a us nuclear submarine hit a 
freighter killing two people the kyodo news service said

fullscale testfiring of experimental 
space shuttle engines will begin here in september for the first 
time since the initial development program about 20 years ago nasa 
engineering officials said 
resumption of the experimental activity will increase morale at 
the marshall space flight center one engineer said 
weve had a lot of passive tests structural tests but there 
wasnt any fire and smoke nasa engineer ron toopen said last 
week you put in a lot of long hard hours and the results of it 
all is that you get to see it here in your own back yard 
the tests will look at new technology items for shuttle 
engine improvement according to charles crane chief of the 
advanced engine development branch of the shuttle main engine 
office 
engineers plan to use a 20story rockettesting stand that was 
last used almost two decades ago to testfire saturn moon rocket 
stages 
the marshall center which is responsible for developing and 
managing the 40 million main shuttle engines will use the stand 
to fire engines for up to 150 seconds at a time 
engineers are seeking ways to make the expensive engines more 
economical the major components of the shuttles main engines now 
are replaced after three or four flights 
these test firings will be a series of prototypes of advanced 
engines to see if components can last longer than we think said 
john mccarty chief of marshalls engineering propulsion lab if 
so mccarty said the price of the engines might be reduced to 
about 20 million in about 10 years 
the test firing program will cost about 15 million to 20 
million annually mccarty said there has been little or no test 
firing to try new ideas since initial engine development in the 
early 1970s 
the way it has been weve had ideas done the design work 
then had to go to a launch at cape canaveral fla to watch it 
work crane said this way its next door

troops in a series of sudden raids into iran and promised today to

1500 iraqis the iranian account could not be independently 
confirmed 
iraq said it would withdraw from all iranian territory within a 
day on sunday iraq reported its troops already had left iran 
the new reports came as the warring nations foreign ministers 
prepared to meet this week with un secretarygeneral javier perez 
de cuellar for talks on a ceasefire 
exactly one week ago and after a string of battlefield defeats 
iran abruptly changed its hardline stance and accepted a yearold 
un resolution for ending the 8yearold war between the persian 
gulf neighbors 
foreign minister ali akbar velayati of iran who was flying to 
new york today said iraqs wideranging attacks along the war 
front threatened a prospective ceasefire

prisoners of war a second un team was scheduled to arrive soon 
in the persian gulf to work out other details of a ceasefire 
interviewed today on abcs good morning america iranian and 
iraqi diplomats charged each others countries with violating the 
spirit of the prospective truce 
at the last minute they want to capture some of our land when 
we have already removed the excuse for the iraqis said mohammed 
jaafar mahallati irans ambassador to the united nations 
unfortunately it has been iraq that has always sabotaged efforts 
of the secretarygeneral to implement un resolution 598 
abdul amir alanbari iraqs ambassador to the united states 
criticized iran for waiting a year to accept the un resolution 
and coupled with that of course all threats and call for 
mobilization and asking the iranian people to go to the front to 
continue the war against what they call the enemy 
we are interested in lasting comprehensive peace not just a 
ceasefire to enable the iranians to mobilize and wage another 
human offensive whenever they would like he said 
supreme court chief justice musavi ardebili of iran said 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini had doubled his popularity by 
accepting the ceasefire irans official islamic republic news 
agency reported today 
tehran radio said khomeini met with a group of visitors who 
chanted please god keep khomeini alive and we are all your 
soldiers we will obey your orders 
the radio said khomeini responded by waving his hand he 
apparently did not speak 
ardebili urged a huge turnout at rallies planned for aug 2 to 
demonstrate allegiance to khomeini the patriarch of irans 
9yearold islamic revolution 
iraq already has accepted the un ceasefire resolution which 
calls for return to previous borders and a prisoner exchange 
according to international red cross figures iran has about 
50000 iraqi pows and iraq held 13000 iranian soldiers before the

number of prisoners would help in peace negotiations

were occupying 1500 square miles of iranian soil on the central 
front 190 square miles in the centralsouthern region and 19 
square miles in the south 
interviewed sunday on abcs this week with david brinkley 
perez de cuellar said he hoped hostilities would cease when he 
began discussions with representatives of the two nations 
asked if talks would be held facetoface perez de cuellar 
said my idea is to discuss separately with both sides of 
course i will be only too pleased if at some stage i could have 
the two sides together 
iraq has said it wants to hold direct negotiations iran 
initially refused but later indicated it might agree to them at 
perez de cuellars request

convention which opens three weeks from today in new orleans 
bush the certain gop nominee was back in washington today 
after spending five days on the road his campaigning between now 
and the opening of the gop gathering will be curtailed because he 
has spent nearly the legal limit for preconvention campaigning 
but the white house said sunday that president reagan probably 
will campaign in the midwest on bushs behalf between now and the 
convention that word came from white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater as reagan was flying back from california on air force 
one 
also aboard was treasury secretary james a baker iii who had 
been in california for a weekend fundraiser and his presence 
fueled new speculation about an imminent departure from the 
administration to run bushs campaign 
fitzwater said baker had a very brief chat with reagan and 
added hes still treasury secretary put it that way 
when reporters sent baker a note asking him to come back and 
talk to them about the matter he sent back a dollar bill and 
suggested that reporters take a close look at the banknote bearing 
his signature

theres no news to share 
bakers status isnt the only source of speculation surrounding 
the bush campaign the vice president traveled to albuquerque

let us all know at the convention atwater said sunday in an 
interview on the cbstv program face the nation he added that

dramatic 
bush in albuquerque to speak to an organization of professional 
and business women unveiled an ambitious 22 billion childcare 
plan that would be phased in over four years the groups 
president beth wray welcomed the plan but tempered her praise by 
calling it one of his first concrete gestures toward women

chants of era a reference to the equal rights amendment 
which the vice president opposes he also was presented with a red 
purse which organization members said signified the gap between 
the earnings of women and men 
on another front bush said in an interview published in newsday 
on sunday that he would consider the creation of an international 
military force that could launch air strikes against foreign drug 
factories 
if you can target a factory that was putting out this poison 
a factory of death thats poisoning kids where a country 
needed assistance to wipe it out id be very openminded about 
that air strikes were talking about a war on drugs he said 
in the interview 
we have helicopters going in there right now striking against 
crops bush said whats so different 
bushs former chief of staff retired adm daniel murphy raised 
the idea at a congressional hearing july 14 sen alfonse damato

fivestate swing from texas to california and back to the east 
returned to washington and planned to resume campaigning on his own 
in a few days 
dukakis was dogged by antiabortion demonstrators throughout the 
day beginning with a sunday church service in st louis where 
about 100 people protested his support of a womans right to an 
abortion later in erie his route away from the airport was lined 
with nearly as many antiabortion protesters 
in erie dukakis appeared with pennsylvania gov robert casey in 
a downtown park where 4000 to 5000 people gathered on a hot and 
sunny afternoon citing the decline in steel industry jobs in the 
region dukakis declared we can turn things around and were 
going to do it 
its time to exchange voodoo for cando he said its 
time to exchange trickledown for building up in this country and 
were going to do it 
in st louis dukakis went to services and spoke from the pulpit 
of the third baptist church with bentsen and former party rival 
rep richard gephardt 
as they entered the downtown church about 100 antiabortion 
demonstrators across the street held up signs and chanted hey 
mike how many babies did you kill today 
dukakis did not acknowledge the protesters but later told 
reporters his position on abortion has been consistent for 25 years 
its a difficult very serious very important ethical and 
moral judgment dukakis said at a news conference inside the 
church building but in my judgment it is a woman in the 
exercise of her conscience and religious beliefs that has to make 
that judgment 
the question is who makes the decision and do we go back to 
the days when we branded a woman a criminal for making that 
decision he added i believe the vast majority of americans 
dont want to go back to those days they think in the last 
analysis this is an issue of conscience 
dukakis went to the church to underscore a fundamental theme of 
his campaign i recent days the commitment to family and community 
that he spoke of in his speech thursday accepting his partys 
nomination 
the most important thing in my life is family dukakis told 
the congregation 
they are our anchors they are the place in which we get our 
strength it was our parents that gave us our sense of values 
sense of ethics our sense of morality he said 
bentsen more conservative on many issues than dukakis did not 
face questioning on the abortion issue however spokesman jack 
devore said bentsen opposes federal funding for abortion except in 
cases of rape incest or when a mothers life is endangered by the 
pregnancy

assailants shot and killed a 
belfast member of the iras political wing today as cardinal john 
oconnor of new york delivering a sermon a mile away denounced 
americans who romanticize violence in ireland 
brendan davidson 33 was shot in the head as he answered a 
knock at his door from three men who apparently were dressed as 
policemen police said 
davidson belonged to sinn fein the legal political wing of the 
outlawed irish republican army and was wounded in an assassination 
attempt last year sinn fein blamed protestant extremists for his 
killing 
on saturday an ira bomb killed a protestant couple and their 
6yearold son as they were driving just north of the 
irelandnorthern ireland border 
the mostly roman catholic ira fighting to drive britain out of 
northern ireland and unite the island has accepted responsibility 
saying it attacked the wrong car press reports say the intended 
victim was a northern ireland judge 
davidson was shot at his home on friendly street as oconnor 
leading a american peace pilgrims on a tour of ireland was 
attending mass with 400 congregants at st peters church in the 
heart of catholic west belfast 
oconnor was told of davidsons killing as he left belfast 
several hours later the cardinal deplored the assassination in his 
sermon to an ecumenical service at st patricks cathedral in 
armagh 
he said the killing along with saturdays bombing poignantly 
brought into focus the stupidity the irrationality of the cycle of 
the violence where can this conceivably end how this can 
conceivably please almighty god 
in belfast oconnor criticized some on our own shores some 
in my own country who romanticize violence when it is several 
thousand miles away who dont know what it does to a land who 
dont know the insecurity that it brings who dont know how it 
keeps a people oppressed 
the catholic prelate developed the theme in armagh criticizing 
americans who continue to perpetuate the myth that this violence 
reflects the glory of ireland that we can stand around pianos and 
sing sentimental songs and believe that what occurs today is in the 
tradition of the martyrs and the saints 
isnt it time that we dispelled such myths isnt it time that 
we recognized that in the sight of almighty god a protestant a 
catholic a jew a moslem a buddhist is a person of sacred 
worth 
oconnor urged americans to heed his host in belfast bishop 
cahal daly who has recognized that regardless of the motive or 
the alleged motive violence the murder of the innocent is 
absolutely intolerably evil and can never be justified 
the cardinal also backed dalys call to the british government 
for more funding to combat unemployment 
st peters cathedral in belfast overlooks the divis flats 
housing project which oconnor toured sunday he urged american 
business to create jobs and deprive the ira of recruits 
oconnor said the hopelessness he encountered at divis flats 
where the unemployment rate is 86 percent grinds into my soul 
i think it would be a tremendous contribution if far more 
american industry were to invest over here he said 
the cardinal acknowledged that violence makes it hard to attract 
industry to northern ireland industry is not going to risk 
coming here if it feels it is going to be subjected to terrorist 
activity so the wheel keeps turning he said 
during his visit to divis flats he was surrounded by children 
several of whom he asked to give me five 
while slapping hands with the prelate mary brannin 10 asked 
him what is a cardinal 
oconnor retorted with a laugh its a red bird 
that was great for me oconnor later told reporters that 
reminds you its all a lot of puffery it brings you down to 
earth

chrysler corp has told its auto dealers that 
prices for fleets of 1989model cars will increase between 3 
percent and 5 percent a company spokesman said today 
however those tentative increases may not have a bearing on 
final retail prices which are expected to be announced in august 
along with final fleet prices said spokesman tony cervone 
auto dealers frequently sign contracts to deliver new cars 
before the model year starts for large fleet customers such as 
rental car companies 
you give your fleet prices early so dealers can lock in 
prices early he said 
final prices may fluctuate depending on a number of things 
including competitors prices and to a smaller extent sales 
figures and inventories cervone said 
last year chrysler announced 8 percent to 12 percent retail 
price increases but wound up with final increases less than that 
the prices for some of the companys slowest selling 1988model 
cars fell compared with 1987 models 
at ford motor co today spokesman dave krupp said there was no 
firm schedule for notifying dealers of tentative fleet prices for 
the coming model year 
general motors corp spokesman dave hudgens said today he had no 
immediate comment on fleet or retail prices

despite a new antismoking law smokers were 
lighting up today in taxicabs airport terminals bus stations and 
other forbidden places 
there hasnt been any difference today said loice wright a 
ticket agent with the chicago transit authority people arent 
paying any attention to the ban 
smoking also is banned in subway stations 
the law which took effect sunday forbids smoking in enclosed 
public places and requires employers to designate nosmoking areas

chicago said today she said she knew of no complaints about the 
new law from the 8000 headquarters employees 
similar laws have taken effect in new york los angeles and

however if nonsmokers here were annoyed by smokers behavior 
the police hadnt heard about it 
weve had no complaints at all officer emmett oconnell 
said sunday night at police headquarters 
police supt leroy martin has pointed out that the ordinance 
creating the ban while it established fines of 25 to 100 did 
not give officers the power of arrest hes suggested that 
nonsmokers give dirty looks to people smoking where they shouldnt 
but some nonsmokers dont seem to care 
i dont think it should be that big an issue said 
nonsmoker jim obrien smoking has been a way of life in this 
country for years to take that away now is unfair 
frank niemien who quit smoking two years ago said he doesnt 
like the ban either 
what else are they going to take away he said theyll be 
coming into our bedrooms pretty soon and telling us what to do 
there 
although smoking in taxicabs also is outlawed taxi driver dean 
davis a threepackaday smoker said ill smoke in my own cab 
no matter what the law says i will never tell a passenger not to 
smoke 
taxi driver suheil ajaj who said he doesnt smoke himself said 
he believes taxi riders have a right to light up i believe the 
customer is paying for the right to smoke he said

in the river which was swollen from torrential rains

between the towns of yibin and leshan stopping along the river to 
pick up and unload passengers the boat was owned by the chongqing

former college football star bobby 
hoppe will not be retried in a 31yearold slaying because there is 
no new evidence in the case a prosecutor said today 
we have gone to great extremes to try to find new proof in 
this case there is no new proof there is nothing different 
than what we had initially said district attorney general gary 
gerbitz 
hoppe 53 went on trial last month for the july 20 1957 
shotgun death of moonshine runner don hudson but a mistrial was 
declared when the jury deadlocked 102 for acquittal 
the state contended that hoppe then a 22yearold college 
student killed hudson because hudson 24 had beaten joan hoppe 
voiles hudsons exgirlfriend and hoppes sister 
hoppe claimed selfdefense testifying that he fired a shotgun 
at hudson only after the bootlegger drove up beside his car on a 
dark street and pointed a pistol at him 
the prosecutor said the state was handicapped because it could 
try hoppe only for firstdegree murder since the statute of 
limitations for lesser degrees of homicide has expired 
if this case would have gone to the jury under a firstdegree 
seconddegree voluntary manslaughter involuntary manslaughter 
option the outcome may very well have been different in june he 
said 
nevertheless gerbitz said the state was pleased that it had 
finally answered the question of who had killed hudson 
for 31 years the hudson family lived with the fact that they 
didnt know who killed their son and their brother he said 
they know now who killed him and even though his admission is 
one of selfdefense it was an admission 
at the time of the slaying hoppe was preparing for his senior 
year at auburn where he was a halfback on the football team that 
fall the tigers went 100 and won their only national championship 
although hoppe was questioned about the slaying in 1957 no 
charges were filed until march 2 1988 when he was indicted after 
a 14month investigation that began when hudsons mother georgia 
hudson asked police to reopen the case

weeks of dry hot weather are forcing the 
states four trout farms into a race with drought as workers rush 
to transfer fish from toowarm hatching troughs to cooler streams 
before they die 
the warmer the water the less oxygen the water has and we 
have trouble keeping them alive said tom ort a worker at the 
states armstrong fish hatchery in marion 
wed rather give the fishermen their fish a month early rather 
than keep them 
because of the summer drought the state wildlife resources 
commission must finish stocking 600000 fish in streams lakes and 
rivers by the end of july a month earlier than usual officials 
say 
already the water in armstrong creek which feeds into 
fishhatching troughs at the armstrong hatchery has topped 70 
degrees three times this month ort said water levels in the creek 
have dropped as well forcing ort to allow seven of his 20 ponds to 
dry up 
most of western north carolinas 2000 miles of trout streams 
lakes and rivers must be stocked by the commission to maintain the 
popular sport of troutfishing 
the states troutstocking program breeds the fish and raises 
them from eggs to a catchable size 8 inches or longer when the 
fish are about 18 months old officials say 
once in the states rivers and streams most trout are caught 
within a week or two said mallory martin a production coordinator 
for the wildlife commission in marion 
i would expect the catch to be higher than usual because the 
water levels have been so low the fish dont have a place to escape

arab assailants today stoned an israeli army 
jeep in the occupied gaza strip forcing the jeep to veer off the 
road and turn over the army said four military police were 
injured 
the incident occurred several hours after the army freed 148 
palestinian prisoners from gaza as a goodwill gesture to moslems on 
the fourday eid aladha holiday or feast of the sacrifice 
an army spokesman said the jeep carrying greenuniformed border 
patrol guards was stoned as it patrolled the jabaliya refugee camp 
the driver was injured in the hand and veered off the road said 
the spokesman who could not be identified in accordance with army 
regulations three other police suffered minor injuries and two of 
them were taken to a hospital he said 
arab news reports said soldiers immediately clamped a curfew on 
the camp banning more than 60000 residents from leaving their 
homes 
the army today freed 148 palestinians from the ketziot tent 
prison in the negev desert a spokesman said 
he said some had been jailed without trial and the rest were 
serving short sentences for crimes linked to the palestinian 
uprising 
israel radio said more than 3000 palestinian detainees would 
remain in ketziot the army said it held more than 5000 
palestinian prisoners in ketziot and other prisons 
the prisoners release came a day after confrontations in the 
occupied territories left two palestinians dead and six wounded 
raising to 233 the arab death toll since the uprising began dec 8 
four israelis have also died 
seven cities and refugee camps in the west bank remained under 
curfew today after the clashes the army said 
the unrest was partly triggered by coinciding jewish and moslem 
holidays the moslem feast marks when the biblical patriarch 
abraham was ordered by god to sacrifice his son isaac 
the jewish commemoration marks the destruction of a jerusalem 
temple by roman rulers nearly 2000 years ago 
a holiday custom calls for the moslems to visit cemeteries and 
leaders of the uprising called on their followers to visit the 
graves of arabs slain during the uprising 
in an unprecedented ruling sunday israels supreme court upheld 
an army decision to temporarily occupy a palestinian home so 
soldiers could oversee a highway that has been the scene of 
numerous stoning attacks on israeli vehicles 
court spokesman shmaryahu cohen said the ruling appeared to be 
the first time the court had allowed soldiers to take over an arab 
house for security purposes 
in the past the army has confiscated wrecked or sealed homes 
belonging to palestinians suspected of involvement in antiisraeli 
violence army radio said soldiers have wrecked or sealed up 52 
palestinian homes since december 
the ruling was one of a series of decisions since the uprising 
began in which the court has consistently upheld measures of the 
israeli military authorities

the historic snee farm home of 
charles pinckney a signer of the us constitution who served as 
governor senator and congressman has been bought by a 
preservation group 
the twostory frame farm house and the surrounding 25 acres in 
suburban mount pleasant had been slated for part of a residential 
development but a citizens group known as friends of historic snee 
farm took title to the property over the weekend 
the group bought the property for 2 million but must still 
raise 1 million to pay off a bank loan said charleston attorney 
nancy hawk one of the organizers of the preservation effort 
the group plans to pay off the remaining debt and turn the site 
over to the national park service 
about 50 people including state and federal officials gathered 
under rainy skies outside the 18th century structure saturday for 
the announcement 
this is a wonderful time for the state of south carolina 
because youre preserving a piece of our state that cannot be 
duplicated and cannot be replicated gov carroll campbell said 
the farm house dates to 1754 pinckey not only was a signer of 
the constitution but also served as a state lawmaker governor 
us senator congressman and american minister to spain 
pinckney claimed to be 26 at the time of the constitutional 
convention in 1787 which would have made him the youngest signer 
however he was really 29 at the time and jonathan dayton of new 
jersey at 27 was actually the youngest signer 
sen strom thurmond told the group youre preserving here some 
of the most important history of south carolina he called 
pinckney the second most important man at the constitutional 
convention after james madison 
the darby family which owned the property also gave a gift of 
100000 for the effort 
of course its a beautiful piece of property and as you know i 
would have liked to have developed it but since they made such a 
dedicated effort we think we did the right thing said gordon 
darby one of the owners 
us sen ernest hollings said the park service has agreed to 
restore the vacant house and operate it as an educational resource 
jerry rogers the assistant director of cultural affairs for the 
national parks service said it will cost about 500000 a year to 
operate the pinckney home

a white university student who 
refused to do cumpulsory military service on the grounds he would 
be defending racism was sentenced monday to six years in prison 
magistrate ph bredenkamp imposed the maximum penalty on david 
bruce for his refusal to undergo the military training required of 
all white males in south africa 
the consequences of your imprisonment are in you own hands 
bredenkamp told bruce 25 you have had the opportunity to 
provide a useful service to the public 
the training involves two years of initial service afterward 
men are subject to annual military callups that can last as long 
as three months 
my view of the south african defense force is that it is not a 
peacekeeping force but that its basic function is that of 
upholding and defending racism bruce said last week at his trial 
bruce declined to request a noncombat posting which sometimes 
is granted to men who object to military training on religious 
grounds bruce refused to serve for moral and political reasons 
saying he strongly opposed the governments apartheid policies of 
racial segregation 
the government does not release statistics on how many white men 
refuse to serve in the military

the government on monday announced sharp price 
increases for cigarettes and liquor but also said 
inflationbattered consumers will be spared further increases this 
year 
yuan mu spokesman for the state council or cabinet said the 
prices of famous brand cigarettes and spirits will be allowed to 
float as of tuesday putting an end to governmentfixed and 
generally arbitrarily low prices 
yuan said the state council had decided not to carry out any 
other price reforms this year to curb inflation which has been 
rising at an alarming rate since the beginning of 1988 the 
official xinhua news agency reported 
the state statistics bureau said last week that consumer prices 
in june were 19 percent higher than in the same month in 1987 
compared to an inflation rate of 72 percent for all of last year 
the government earlier this year raised the prices of eggs 
vegetables pork and sugar as part of reforms aimed at ending state 
controls over prices and allowing the value of goods to be 
determined by market forces 
the elimination of government controls has caused the prices of 
some goods to soar as the inefficient economy fails to keep up with 
rising demand black market dealings and hoarding of goods still 
sold at governmentset prices have also boosted prices 
xinhua quoted li changbi an official of the state 
administration of commodity prices as saying the prices of famous 
brand cigarettes could go up between 15 and 290 percent after they 
are allowed to fluctuate 
li said the price for a bottle of maotai chinas most 
famous and soughtafter spirit will jump from 540 to 3240 
yuan said the price increases for choice cigarettes and wines 
will have little social impact because most buyers are government 
organizations and those individuals with high incomes 
but li said the price of bgrade cigarettes will also be boosted 
by 134 percent and all alcohol made from grain will go up in price 
by 20 percent 
china uses 14 million tons of grain a year to make beer and 
other alcohol and the government has said this is a luxury the 
nation cant afford when it is struggling to produce enough grain 
just to keep its 1 billion people fed 
communist party general secretary zhao ziyang and other 
reformminded leaders in recent months have emphasized that price 
reform is risky but inevitable if china is to modernize its economy 
and end the heavy financial burden of price subsidizing 
the government has put off decontrolling prices partly because 
of mounting public discontent over the rising cost of living 
the politburo the partys supreme decisionmaking body 
announced in june that systematic plans for price reform were being 
drawn up senior officials said the program would take three to 
five years to carry out 
yuan said price adjustments will resume jan 1 1989 when 
newspapers which have been hit by jumps in the price of newsprint 
will cost more he did not say what the increase would be 
yuan said the rise in the cost of cigarettes should curb 
speculation and profiteering that has thrived under the current 
pricing system 
china is the worlds biggest cigarette producer and consumer 
turning out 228 billion cigarettes a year for its 300 million 
smokers

a special ruling party congress today 
accepted the resignation of strongman ne win but rejected his call 
for a referendum that could have ended 26 years of oneparty rule 
a congress delegate said 
official rangoon radio however said only that ne wins 
resignation had been debated by the delegates and did not indicate 
what action if any was reached 
the delegate who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
ruling burma socialist program party congress agreed to accept the 
resignations of ne win as party chief and san yu as the vice 
chairman but to retain them as inactive members 
burmese analysts suggested that the vagueness of the official 
radio broadcast reflected divisions within party ranks 
the broadcast said the 1061 party delegates empowered the 
partys central committee to evaluate a sweeping proposal for 
economic reform but it gave no indication of whether any of the 
new measures had been accepted 
the threeday congress of the ruling burma socialist program 
party has been considering dramatic changes in a statecontrolled 
economic system that turned a potentially prosperous country into a 
debtridden povertystricken nation 
the key architect of the system ne win tendered his 
resignation saturday as chairman of the party and offered to remove 
himself from political life five other top leaders likewise 
submitted resignations 
state radio announced sunday that an emergency session of 
parliament would convene wednesday apparently to act on ne wins 
proposal of holding a referendum on whether burma should scrap a 
quarter century of oneparty rule in favor of a multiparty system 
the emergency session could also deal with the appointment of 
new government leaders to replace the five who are resigning the 
five including president san yu held government posts in addition 
to their party positions 
prime minister maung maung kha one of the few top leaders not 
on the resignation roll was expected to be named today to replace 
the 77yearold ne win as chairman of the ruling party 
the sudden and generally unexpected changes come in wake of 
bloody antigovernment riots and worsening economic conditions in 
the isolationist southeast asian nation 
the official radio broadcasting from the congress carried 
speeches of several among the more than 1000 delegates asking ne 
win to reconsider his retirement until success has been 
achieved 
indeed some western diplomats doubt that ne win who has held 
undisputed power for 26 years will desist from interference in 
the future party and the organization of the new government 
not only did the former military chief who seized power in a 
1962 coup crush antigovernment opposition that occasionally 
flared he also moved against leaders within his own ranks when 
they exhibited too much promise and independence 
this has left a leadership vacuum in rangoon that may prove 
difficult to fill if there is a wholesale removal of officials from 
party and government ranks as ne win indicated 
maung maung kha who assumed the prime ministership in 1977 has 
to date not exhibited any particular dynamism or vision that would 
be necessary to implement the wideranging reforms being debated by 
the congress 
in a speech on sunday party general secretary aye ko admitted 
that economic production had declined working skills have 
deteriorated and losses and wastages cannot be controlled 
effectively 
because of these weaknesses and as a result of adverse 
repercussions from the world economic conditions today the state 
economic situation is declining he said 
aye ko called for cutting most state involvement in agriculture 
mining fisheries industry transportation and other economic 
sectors 
he also called for allowing private joint ventures between 
burmese entrepreneurs and foreign investors something ne win 
outlawed shortly after seizing power 
since october studentled demonstrations have erupted three 
times in rangoon and the unrest spread to other cities 
martial law continues in prome 180 miles north of the capital 
where there were riots last week 
last month at least 50 people died in antigovernment unrest

americans believe the united states has lost its 
edge in space exploration and favor initiatives including a us 
space station and manned flights to mars a media 
generalassociated press poll has found 
a sizable share of the respondents in the national poll said the 
united states was doing too little in space exploration as well as 
backing new efforts a majority expressed support for the space 
shuttle program 
nasa plans to resume shuttle launches in september more than 2 
years after the shuttle challenger exploded during takeoff killing 
the seven astronauts aboard however equipment problems may delay 
the launch 
nearly half of the 1223 adults surveyed said the shuttle 
explosion had shaken their confidence in nasa and 60 percent of 
that group said their faith in the space agency has not been 
restored 
that means that about 30 percent of all respondents lacked 
confidence in nasa still when asked to rate its overall 
effectiveness 58 percent said it has done a good or excellent job 
while 37 percent said only fair or poor 
about half the respondents said nasas budget should remain the 
same and 30 percent said it should be increased despite concerns 
over the federal deficit only 18 percent said the space budget 
should be decreased and of those who wanted nasas budget 
increased 74 percent said they would be willing to pay higher 
taxes to accomplish it 
in another indication of general support for space projects 40 
percent said the nation was doing too little in exploring space and 
36 percent said it was doing about enough just about a fifth said 
the united states was doing too much in space exploration 
there was a striking split between the sexes with men far more 
likely than women to favor space programs fiftysix percent of men 
said the united states was doing too little in space exploration 
only a quarter of women agreed fortyone percent of men supported 
increasing the space exploration budget compared to just 19 
percent of women 
the national aeronautics and space administration was created by 
congress 30 years ago to pursue civilian exploration of space but 
in recent years it increasingly has handled military payloads as 
well that was opposed by a slim plurality in the survey 
fortyeight percent said nasa should be involved in nonmilitary 
projects only while 41 percent approved including military work 
the split was narrowly outside the polls margin of error of plus 
or minus three percentage points 
fewer than a quarter of respondents said the united states is 
ahead of the soviet union in space exploration while the remainder 
were split on whether the soviets are ahead or the two countries 
are about even 
at the same time there was sentiment for superpower cooperation 
in space about half of those polled favored last months proposal 
by the soviets for a ussoviet joint effort to send astronauts to 
mars 
an additional 15 percent said the united states should work 
alone to reach mars taken together 64 percent favored some 
program to land astronauts on mars while 30 percent were opposed 
the rest had no opinion 
nasa has no program to send astronauts to mars it is seeking 
funding for a space station but the 200 million approved by the 
senate this month is only enough to phase out the program or put it 
on hold the house had approved 700 million and a joint committee 
is to resolve the issue 
the goal of a space station was supported by 55 percent with 34 
percent opposed 
on the soontobe resumed space shuttle program 40 percent said 
efforts should be expanded and the same number said work should 
continue at the same level fewer than a fifth said the shuttle 
program should be cut back

attorneys for us district judge alcee 
hastings have asked for a delay in tuesdays scheduled vote by the 
house judiciary committee on an impeachment recommendation 
contending the panel is rushing to a decision on a 
precedentsetting issue 
we cant see any need for what seems to us an unseemly 
haste said terence anderson one of hastings attorneys on 
monday 
a committee staff member said the request for a delay had been 
received but that no decision had been made and the vote was still 
scheduled for 10 am tuesday 
hastings the first black appointed to the federal bench in 
florida was acquitted in 1983 of bribery charges but the house 
judiciary criminal justice subcommittee has recommended that he be 
impeached on 17 counts of official misconduct including some 
relating to the bribery case 
the full committee was scheduled to act on the recommendation 
tuesday 
anderson contrasted the handling of his clients case with that 
of us district judge walter nixon of mississippi in nixons 
case the subcommittee heard direct evidence from three key 
witnesses at his trial which ended in a conviction for lying to a 
grand jury 
the house subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights 
brought impeachment charges against nixon which still are pending 
in congress 
but in hastings case the panel relied on secondhand testimony 
of prosecutor john doar even though hastings was acquitted of the 
charges by the trial jury he said 
anderson also said the printed record of the subcommittees 
proceedings had not yet been printed and distributed to members 
were saying its just plain unseemly for you to be trying 
to decide this before you give members an opportunity to study the 
record he said 
if the judiciary committee votes to draft misconduct charges 
the full house is expected to vote on impeachment before it 
recesses aug 11 
hastings was acquitted in 1983 of conspiring with washington 
attorney william a borders jr for 150000 in bribes

if you thought the 60s were swinging just look 
at the 80s 
according to a statistical study published monday the sexual 
permissiveness associated with the 1960s is tame stuff compared 
with the 1980s aids and yuppie puritanism notwithstanding 
the swinging 60s were invented largely by british pop 
musicians fashion designers and hairstylists so it was 
appropriate that the study came from a british independent research 
office the family policy studies center 
it reported that the divorce rate has jumped from 21 per 1000 
marriages in 1961 to 129 in 1986 illegitimate births are up from 
6 percent to 21 percent births are down from 179 per 1000 to 
133 and teenage brides are down from 28 percent to 14 percent 
it says that between 1960 and 1964 only one in 100 firsttime 
brides under age 25 lived with their partners before marrying them 
twenty years later the figure is almost one in four the study 
says 
figures for bridegrooms do not appear in the government 
statistics used in the study according to its editor melanie 
henwood 
the report says the figures suggest a much more liberal attitude 
in the 1980s toward childbirth out of wedlock 
not only has illegitimacy more than trebled but the mothers 
apparently feel much less compulsion to marry before giving birth 
while the fathers are more likely to acknowledge paternity 
the study said 38 percent of birth certificates for illegitimate 
children bore the names of both parents in 1961 in 1986 the 
figure had risen to 66 percent it said 
the paradox of the 1960s may be less of a puzzle than it first 
appears the report concludes it is after all the people who 
grew up in or were living through the 1960s who are now making 
their appearance in many of the cohabitation illegitimacy 
marriage and divorce statistics the class of 68 has come of age 
the swinging 60s do seem a bit of mythical when we look at 
the facts and figures but it really depends on the image of 
60s ms henwood said in an interview 
at 30 she admits to having no firsthand experience of the 
swinging 60s but knows they were a period of great change 
music clothing and politics we look back and assume it was a 
time of free love communes that sort of thing in fact what made 
the image was a few notorious figures living in permissive 
relationships but their values were not shared by most people at 
the time 
the times of london asked some leading figures of the 60s what 
they thought of the study 
the swinging 60s took their name from the music not the 
morality said actor terence stamp who made his name playing the 
title role in the 1962 film version of billy budd 
compare michael jackson to elvis presley prince to jimi 
hendrix and the pet shop boys to the beatles there you have the 
essential difference between the 60s and the 80s stamp was 
quoted as saying 
jean shrimpton the model who made the miniskirt famous was 
quoted as saying i never had a swinging mentality i wore short 
skirts but i was a commodity of the 60s it was other people who 
were making things happen i just happened to be there 
and cartoonist ralph steadman was quoted as saying the 
permissive society was about lots of things not just sex we were 
willing to buck authority now life is getting more and more 
standardized and barren and there is a backlash spurred by aids a 
reformist influence which does rather tend to concentrate the 
mind

minister has made no public statements about the matter 
political analysts predict difficulties ahead for an 
administration led by the former general 
the new government will face the same difficult problems it 
endured under prems last administration because there is growing 
and open resentment of and opposition to prem said somboon 
suksamran a political scientist at chulalongkorn university in 
bangkok 
friction among coalition partners caused trouble in prems last 
government 
somboon and other political observers say prem might not be able 
to complete a fouryear term he called sundays election two years 
early 
prem has been prime minister since 1980 dissolved parliament 
twice for elections survived two coup attempts and formed five 
cabinets he is the longestserving premier in modern thai history 
among his serious problems are flagging support in the powerful 
military sharp criticisms from opposition parties and protests by 
students and labor

telegram in arabic from hezbollah security officials in iran to the 
military attache at the iranian embassy in the lebanese capital

lebanon but hezbollah in beirut is believed to be an umbrella for 
the shiite groups who hold 18 foreign captives including a west 
german 
sat1 did not say how it obtained the document but said it 
showed personnel at the west german embassy in beirut were in the 
gravest danger 
according to sat1 the telegram said 
we want to inform you that we now have received sufficient 
addresses and information about the embassy of the federal republic 
west germany we will tell you about the action plan as soon as 
possible which we with the help of our people in east beirut

white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
monday that while its likely president reagan will veto congress 
latest attempt to require employers to give workers advance notice 
of layoffs or plant shutdowns its always open until its done 
fitzwater told reporters the bill which passed both the house 
and senate earlier this month by vetoproof margins had arrived at 
the white house and that reagan has until aug 3 to make a 
decision 
the spokesman said the issue was likely to be raised at a 
meeting reagan will hold tuesday with republican congressional 
leaders but he disputed suggestions that gop lawmakers will urge 
the president to sign the bill 
i would say there are number of them who will recommend a 
veto fitzwater said 
last week white house chief of staff kenneth duberstein told 
reporters in santa barbara calif that a reagan veto was likely 
meanwhile the administrations stand on the issue was repeatedly 
assailed by democrats at their national convention in atlanta 
duberstein said our longstanding position has been that it is 
unacceptable to the president that he has signaled veto he has 
vetoed it once already as part of another bill and i would suspect 
that position will be maintained 
but during the daily white house news briefing monday fitzwater 
left the door slightly ajar 
duberstein said it was likely or most likely that he would 
veto it the spokesman said i have said that from this podium 
that certainly is the case but its always open until its done 
there are some congressional leaders who would like to give us 
the benefits of their advice and this is an opportunity for them to 
do it fitzwater said 
a provision requiring private industry to give workers 60 days 
advance notice of plant closings was contained in legislation 
congress passed earlier this year overhauling the nations trade 
laws 
reagan vetoed the bill saying he didnt want the government 
legislating restrictions on the ability of company executives to 
make critical decisions reagan said the matter of worker 
notification should be left to employers and employees to work out 
separately 
vice president george bush certain to get the republican 
nomination for president in new orleans next month has stated 
sentiments similar to reagans on the issue although there have 
been reports the bush campaign would prefer to see the president 
let the bill become law 
fitzwater said monday he didnt know anything about whether the 
bush campaign was arguing a case for the signing of the 
plantclosing bill

tibets only comprehensive institute of higher 
learning on friday awarded diplomas to the remote mountain regions 
first university graduates it was reported monday 
the official xinhua news agency said 246 students graduated from 
tibet university with 74 receiving bachelors degrees in 
literature law and philosophy 
the university located in the tibetan capital of lhasa was 
established in 1985 as tibets first full university the region 
also has a teachers college 
the universitys 778 students are enrolled in eight departments 
and 14 of its 17 professors and associate professors are of tibetan 
nationality xinhua said 
the beijing government has tried to aid tibet one of chinas 
most impoverished and least developed areas by building schools 
hospitals and roads and providing funds for industry 
relations between tibetans and nontibetan chinese remain 
strained by a long history of confrontations climaxing in the 
196676 cultural revolution when leftists persecuted many tibetans 
and tried to suppress tibetan religion and language 
last fall and again in march crowds led by buddhist monks staged 
antichinese proindependence riots but beijing insists they 
represented a small minority of tibetans and that the lives of 
tibetans have improved markedly under communist rule

the world bank may wither away as the biggest 
source of aid to the third world unless congress acts soon to 
pledge a new contribution paul a volcker former head of the 
federal reserve board warned on monday 
the bank headed by barber b conable a former congressman from 
new york wants a us pledge of 701 million a year over the next 
six years for an increase in its capital 
so far 140 of the 151 governments that own the bank have 
decided to contribute among the other countries that have not made 
a pledge are algeria cambodia vietnam and south yemen 
president reagan has urged approval of the contribution it has 
been held up in congress by disagreement over what should be done 
to handle the bulk of the third worlds 12 trillion debt 
last year the bank got back more in repayments and interest from 
third world borrowers than it gave them in new loans bank 
officials want to reverse that trend and increase lending to well 
over 20 billion a year in the early 1990s 
our influence and leadership within the bank are certainly at 
stake and i would raise the question if the united states is 
not going to participate in capital increases whether the bank 
itself can survive over a long period of time volcker told a 
news conference 
he added that the bank could continue lending for a year or two 
without new capital the united states as the biggest shareholder 
is expected to furnish more than 18 percent 
but against the prospect of not getting their capital 
replenished it is not in the nature of the beast and would not be 
responsible for them to continue lending at that rate of speed in 
the face of a vote of noconfidence by their major shareholders 
said volcker who left the fed last year 
a contribution has been endorsed by former presidents carter 
ford and nixon last week they were joined by nine former 
secretaries of the treasury 
a group of supporters the bretton woods committee is seeking 
statements of backing from the major presidential candidates

men dressed as policemen killed 
an ira man monday while cardinal john oconnor of new york 
delivered a sermon a mile away in which he implored americans not 
to romanticize irish violence 
brendan davidson a member of sinn fein the outlawed irish 
republican armys legal political wing was shot in the head after 
answering a knock on his door police said 
davidson 33 belonged to the sinn fein the outlawed irish 
republican armys legal political wing an ira statement issued in 
belfast said he was one of its members 
he was shot down 48 hours after an ira bomb killed a protestant 
couple and their 6yearold son who had just driven across the 
border from the irish republic 
the ira took responsibility but said the attack was on the wrong 
target press reports suggested the intended victim may have been a 
judge who drove past shortly afterward 
oconnor learned of davidsons death after leaving belfast to 
deliver a sermon in armagh 
he said the killing and saturdays bombing poignantly 
brought into focus the stupidity the irrationality of the cycle of 
the violence where can this conceivably end how this can 
conceivably please almighty god 
authorities said three men wearing police uniforms killed 
davidson and escaped in a red car 
sinn fein said it did not believe policemen committed the crime 
but that the assailants could have had help from sympathizers in 
the royal ulster constabulary the mainly protestant police force 
in the british province 
when davidson was shot on friendly street the cardinal was at 
st peters cathedral in the heart of roman catholic west belfast 
deploring some on our own shores some in my own country who 
romanticize violence when it is several thousand miles away who 
dont know what it does to a land who dont know the insecurity 
that it brings who dont know how it keeps a people oppressed 
oconnor who is leading 300 americans on a pilgrimage to pray 
for peace in ireland returned to that theme at armagh in the 
south of the province 
addressing an ecumenical congregation at st patricks 
cathedral he again denounced americans who continue to 
perpetuate the myth that this violence reflects the glory of 
ireland that we can stand around pianos ad sing sentimental songs 
and believe that what occurs today is in the tradition of the 
martyrs and the saints 
the bombing saturday was the fifth admitted blunder by the ira 
that has killed or wounded innocent civilians since november when 
11 protestants at a war memorial ceremony were killed by a bomb 
intended for british soldiers 
at least 2660 people have been killed since political and 
sectarian warfare began in northern ireland in august 1969 
including 44 so far this year the ira wants to drive the british 
from northern ireland and unite it with the predominantly catholic 
republic 
the terrorism has got to be deplored on either side mayor 
edward i koch of new york who is on the pilgrimage told 
reporters in armagh no one believes that because the cardinal 
and 300 pilgrims came from new york that we were going to be 
stopping terrorism in fact the acts of terrorism underscore the 
need for prayer 
tom king britains northern ireland secretary said every 
murder is an atrocity and just this weekend weve had a 
particularly awful atrocity committed by the ira and the trouble 
is once one is committed then somebody on the other extreme feels 
the need to strike back 
he met with oconnor and koch separately and praised their 
intelligent and constructive interest compared with what he 
called the nonsense talked in america and ignorance of the 
true situation in northern ireland 
oconnor toured divis flats the highrise homes of some of 
belfasts most impoverished catholics on sunday and urged american 
investors to bring business and jobs to the area 
he said he looked across the geographical divisions of the city 
which are based on religion and i asked myself good lord where 
is the rationale in this how can we purport to be made in the 
image and likeness of almighty god

governmentset retail prices 
qiao 35 was arrested in september 1985 and sentenced to death

with the rising number of economic criminals such as speculators 
profiteers and embezzlers

president reagan said today hes ready to talk 
to iran about american hostages held by proiranian extremists in 
lebanon if theyre ready 
at the conclusion of a white house rose garden ceremony honoring 
young men selected by the american legion to study politics and 
government reagan was asked are you ready to talk to iran about 
the hostages is it time 
if theyre willing and ready to talk its time he said 
an administration official said earlier today that despite a new 
us message last week iran still has not sent an authorized 
reply to american entreaties about talks on normalizing relations 
after an eightyear lapse 
the message reiterated us desires to discuss ties with tehran 
and did not lay down conditions for a resumption of relations 
broken in april 1980 said the official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
he said the united states would like to talk to the iranians 
about ending the persian gulf war the nine americans held hostage 
in lebanon and terrorism 
he said however that the united states had not imposed 
conditions for talks 
in any event the official said tehran had not proposed an 
authorized representative to respond to the us overtures 
on sunday two senior us officials said the administration 
deserves much of the credit for irans acceptance of a ceasefire 
in its long war with iraq 
this is a time if not for bragging at least its been a time 
for all of us to be proud that our policy has been a success 
john whitehead deputy secretary of state said 
defense secretary frank c carlucci agreed and said a ceasefire 
means the yearold policy of escorting reflagged kuwaiti tankers 
through the persian gulf will end as soon as we judge it safe 
and prudent to do so 
but carlucci appearing on the nbctv program meet the 
press refused to set a date for the reduction of navy ships in 
the waterway there are 27 us warships there compared with the 
five or six that patrolled the gulf before the convoys began 
carlucci also said improved usiranian relations could lead to 
the release of the nine americans held hostage in lebanon by 
iranianbacked groups 
iran has accepted united nations resolution 598 which calls for 
a ceasefire in the eightyear war while the two sides try to 
negotiate a lasting peace even as representatives of both 
countries prepare to meet with un officials iraq has launched a 
new series of attacks against iran 
whitehead appearing on abctvs this week with david 
brinkley said certainly irans decision is not solely 
attributable to us policy but our firmness of our military 
presence in the gulf our indication that we planned to stay there 
as long as it was necessary and at the same time our diplomatic 
track principally at the united nations has finally achieved 
success 
carlucci asked about the impact of administration policy on 
iran said i think its been quite significant dont forget 
that iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini has consistently 
said that he was going to drive us from the gulf 
the fact that we have been resolute that we have stood by our 
friends that we have stood by the principles of freedom of 
navigation and that he has not been able to drive us from the gulf 
has had a significant impact on iranian thinking carlucci said 
one result of a ceasefire will be an end to the navys 
protection of tankers in the gulf carlucci said although he 
declined to be specific about when that would occur the navy has 
run 49 convoys 
its a little hard to make that kind of judgment at this 
point he said when asked about a date 
we want to watch the negotiations wed probably want to take 
some reasonable interval to make certain that the ceasefire 
holds he said but theres no desire to keep 27 ships there 
any longer than possible we would certainly draw down the number 
of us ships as soon as feasible 
ending the war eventually could lead to better relations between 
iran and other nations including the united states both men said 
iran has taken a number of steps in recent weeks to improve 
relations with other countries 
we have consistently said that were prepared to enter into a 
dialogue with iran carlucci said all they have to do is 
designate somebody who is officially empowered to talk to us and 
wed be glad to talk with them about policy issues about 
terrorism about bringing peace to the region about whatever is 
appropriate 
asked about reports the us hostages might be released if the 
war ends carlucci said were obviously not going to discuss any 
quid pro quo but if the iranians want to talk to us about the 
hostage situation and how theyre going to go about influencing 
their release wed be delighted to talk to them about it im not 
in the slightest suggesting that there would be any deal for the 
hostages that is contrary to our policy 
whitehead asked about the same reports said i have no 
information to indicate the reports are true 
but he added that irans acceptance of the un resolution means 
we may be beginning a process in which we can begin a dialogue 
with iran about the subjects of grave concern to us of which the

cambodias warring parties held peace 
talks monday for the first time but they apparently made no 
progress on negotiating an end to the countrys civil war 
the two central problems to be tackled are the future of the 
communist khmer rouge guerrillas and organizing elections for a new 
cambodian government 
although we have not solved any concrete problems each side 
has revealed its position to the other side said cambodian prime 
minister hun sen after talks with the three guerrilla groups which 
oppose his vietnameseinstalled government 
the four cambodian leaders gathered in the summer palace of the 
late president sukarno in bogor a mountain retreat 37 miles 
outside jakarta for the socalled cocktail party of the 
factions 
this is a very preliminary stage said indonesias foreign 
minister ali alatas who organized the meeting 
on monday hun sen met with guerrilla leaders khieu samthan of 
the communist khmer rouge son sann of the khmer peoples national 
liberaton front and prince norodom ranariddh who represented his 
father prince norodom sihanouk 
the four later were joined by representatives of vietnam its 
close ally laos and the foreign ministers of the association of 
southeast asia nations thailand indonesia malaysia singapore 
the philippines and brunei which is the main backer of the 
guerrillas 
vietnam which invaded cambodia in 1978 and by western count 
maintains more than 100000 troops there says it has withdrawn 
several thousand soldiers it has announced it will pull out 50000 
troops this year and the rest by early 1990 
hun sen told reporters he presented a sevenpoint proposal for a 
political settlement in cambodia the plan contains mostly 
positions that already had been rejected by the guerrillas 
it calls for maintaining the statusquo in cambodia until 
elections are organized to form a new government hun sen has said 
he cannot accept the guerrillas demand that he dissolve his 
government before the elections 
instead he said he proposed forming a ntional reconciliation 
council headed by sihanouk to implement any peace agreements and 
organize the elections 
sihanouk resigned july 10 as the president of the guerrilla 
coalition because he said the khmer rouge were killing his men he 
arrived in indonesia on saturday as a guest of president suharto 
but said he would not attend the bogor talks 
the prince is considered the central figure in a settlement and 
future government and hun sen said the leaders of all four 
factions would meet him in jakarta in the next few days 
hun sen also demanded the dissolution of the khmer rouge the 
largest of the guerrilla forces 
only by eliminating the khmer rouge can we eliminate the 
possibility of the pol pot regime returning to cambodia hun sen 
said 
from 1975 until vietnam invaded the fanatical khmer rouge 
regime of prime minister pol pot killed hundreds of thousands of 
people diplomats say the khmer rouge is storing arms for attacks 
after the vietnamese troops leave cambodia 
the meeting represents the first gathering of the four cambodian 
parties hun sen and sihanouk held two rounds of unsuccessful talks 
since 1987 but vietnam has never met with the factions of the 
cambodian resistance 
asked if he was happy with the talks vietnams delegate 
foreign minister nguyen co thach said i am optimistic i dont 
say happy but optimistic 
three buddhist monks from the united states canada and france 
chanted prayers for the success of the talks outside the dutch 
colonial palace where the meetings were held 
alatas said the meeting is to continue tuesday and would last 
as long as it takes the tentative schedule called for two days 
of talks

former rep robert n mcclory an illinois 
republican reluctantly thrust into the national spotlight for his 
role in impeachment proceedings against president richard nixon is 
dead at age 80 
mcclory who represented the chicago suburbs in congress for 20 
years until 1982 collapsed at church sunday and died a short time 
later at george washington university hospital his wife doris 
said monday 
he went out jogging got a paper and then came back to go with 
me to church everything was fine mrs mcclory said then it 
happened he just collapsed and never came out of it 
mcclory was the secondranking republican on the house judiciary 
committee during congressional hearings on the breakin at the 
democratic national committee headquarters in the watergate complex 
in washington 
although he was a gop loyalist mcclory was one of the leading 
house supporters of an article of impeachment in 1974 charging 
nixon with abusing his constitutional powers in the watergate 
matter he drafted another article charging the president with 
contempt of congress for resisting subpoenas 
i feel really torn mcclory said in an interview at the 
time but im disassociating this job from my relationship with 
the president on philosophy and policies 
during the impeachment hearings mcclory said he was not 
convinced that nixon was directly involved in the watergate coverup 
but rejected suggestions that he had a partisan obligation to 
defend the president against all of the accusations 
i have heard it said by some that they cannot understand how a 
republican could vote to impeach a republican president he said 
in the committees opening debate on impeachment let me hasten 
to assert that that argument demeans my role here it would make a 
mockery of our entire inquiry 
nixon resigned the presidency after the committee voted three 
articles of impeachment 
born in riverside ill mcclory graduated from dartmouth 
college and chicagokent school of law and practiced law in the 
chicago area until 1950 when he was elected to the illinois house 
of representatives he served in the state senate from 1952 to 1962 
while in congress mcclory was a house manager of the equal 
rights amendment and a sponsor of legislation providing that 
federal holidays such as labor day and memorial day be celebrated 
on monday 
mcclorys congressional district in the northern and western 
suburbs of chicago was eliminated by reapportionment in 1981 
rather than opposing incumbent rep john porter also a republican 
in the expanded 10th district he chose not to seek reelection in 
1982 
he will be best remembered for his leadership during the 
watergate hearings and his abiding commitment to the rule of law 
porter said monday along with tens of thousands of people from 
our area i share a tremendous sense of loss in bobs passing 
mcclory had lived in the nations capital since leaving office 
and was a member of the washington law firm of baker amp mckenzie 
he is survived by his wife two sons and a daughter 
mcclory will be buried friday following a private service in 
illinois his wife said she said a public memorial service was 
scheduled for 11 am saturday at the united methodist church in 
lake bluff ill where he had maintained a home since the 1930s

a practice space shuttle countdown 
hit a snag monday delaying a critical testfiring of discoverys 
three main engines 24 hours until sunday 
the postponement was announced as engineers assessed methods for 
fixing a small shuttle gas leak without having to take discovery 
off the launch pad a move that could delay the planned early 
september launch by as much as two months 
the launch team started the countdown late sunday and fell 
behind early in closing out the shuttles rear engine compartment 
on the pad that forced a oneday delay in the loading of gases 
aboard the spaceships energyproducing fuel cells 
the plan now calls for crews to pump more than half a million 
gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen into discoverys 
external fuel tank late wednesday and early thursday 
it will mark the first time a shuttle has been fueled since the 
fleet was grounded by the challenger explosion jan 28 1986 
on thursday when the countdown reaches 10 seconds before a mock 
liftoff a simulated problem is to force a postponement crews then 
will rehearse what they call a 72hour launch turnaround exercise 
they will empty the fuel tank start another countdown and aim for 
a testfiring of discoverys main engines at 730 am sunday 
the 20second firing with the shuttle locked firmly on the pad 
will check modifications made to turbopumps and other engine 
systems and is considered crucial to discovery being certified for 
the first postchallenger shuttle flight 
the launch with a fiveman crew is scheduled for early 
september but the date is uncertain because of the leak in a 
steering engine system that is separate from the main engines 
nasa officials believe that even if the leak can be fixed on the 
pad the launch will be delayed past the middle of september 
experts were considering several ways to reach and plug the 
inaccessible leak from cutting a hole through the shuttle cargo 
bay wall to running a snakelike tube 20 feet through the 
halfinchdiameter gas line 
tests over the weekend ruled out using the tube in two 
configurations one would have used it to deliver an expandable 
teflon balloon filled with sealant to plug the leak in the other 
sealant would been pumped through a hollow tube to the leak 
the tube testing is being done at the materials and processing 
laboratory at the marshall space flight center in huntsville ala 
lab director bob schwinghamer said monday the balloon and hollow 
tube approaches proved impractical 
but he said another approach in which a badmintonlike 
shuttlecock is attached to the end of the snake showed promise 
in reaching the leak 
we have tested it eight times successfully and it looks very 
attractive schwinghamer said he suggested that if this method 
didnt work nasa then could consider cutting a hole in the cargo 
bay

residents are ready to greet the 
humming toadfish in its yearly mating ritual with a comparable 
human sound theyre going to play kazoos 
until the humming toadfish was identified as living in 
richardson bay in 1985 residents were baffled by a strange humming 
sound coming from the water 
the july 31 celebration will include more than 25 environmental 
groups as well as ecological and historical exhibits lectures and 
boat tours all in honor of the fish 
the humming toadfish used to be an irritating puzzle that awoke 
sausalito houseboat residents nightly beginning toward the end of 
july 
the first time it happened practically everybody in the 
houseboats jumped out of bed and looked in their electrical 
boxes said suzanne simpson a festival spokeswoman and one of 
the many houseboat residents who had no idea what the eerie buzzing 
sound was when it first occurred in 1984 
in their search for mates the male fish emit the humming noise 
and other buzzing sounds through vibrating gas bladders

even though the two allstar softball 
teams were playing in the metrodome home of the minnesota twins 
there was no danger of mistaking them for baseballs 1987 world 
champions 
however the benefit game sunday between the democratic farmer 
labor and independent republican teams had some of the trappings of 
major league baseball 
there were at least four insidethepark home runs and some 
spectacular fielding plays during the game won by the ir team 
2013 
a pitcher suspected of scuffing the softball was even ejected 
for allegedly concealing a huge wad of sandpaper while on the mound 
in the manner of twins pitcher joe niekro niekro was suspended for 
10 days last year after being caught with an emery board and 
sandpaper on the mound in anaheim calif 
the softball game was billed as a benefit between ir 
politicians led by former state rep david jennings chairman of 
george bushs minnesota campaign and dflers who were led by 
cocaptains us rep martin sabo and state rep phyllis kahn each 
group sold about 500 12 tickets 
about 400 of the 38008 fans who attended the twinsorioles game 
stayed to watch the slapstick game 
kahn the dfl cocaptain and starting pitcher was resplendent 
in iridescent purple pink and green plaid shorts she had some 
trouble controlling her pitches and was replaced in the second 
inning after yielding 11 runs 
the most important thing in politics as well as baseball is 
to know when its time to move on kahn said 
in the fifth inning with the irs leading 128 sabo complained 
about the ir pitcher state rep chris tjornhom and asked the 
umpire to check for illegalities 
sabo accompanied the umpire to the mound where a large piece of 
sandpaper fell to the ground next to the pitcher tjornhom looking 
indignant was ejected

burmas ruling political party on monday 
accepted the resignation of strongman ne win after 26 years as head 
of the party but opposed his call for a referendum on ending 
oneparty rule a delegate said 
at the final session of a threeday congress the ruling burma 
socialist program party also considered sweeping economic reforms 
designed to cure the countrys deepening economic woes 
the 77yearold ne win who came to power in a 1962 military 
coup announced abruptly saturday he was resigning he cited bloody 
antigovernment rioting in march and june and his age as key 
factors in his decision 
ne win has been blamed for leading burma into economic disaster 
during 26 years of isolationist policies 
five veteran party leaders also submitted their resignations 
saturday 
the party delegate who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the 1061 delegates at the congress voted to accept ne wins 
resignation and that of party vice chairman san yu also the 
countrys president but to retain them as inactive members 
official radio rangoon did not announce the decision 
broadcasting only remarks by party general secretary aye ko saying 
some delegates to the congress had favored approving the 
resignations 
political analysts speculated the official silence indicated 
division within party ranks on the course of the country 
ko also said the delegates rejected the resignations submitted 
by four of the party leaders because they were still young and 
energetic 
the four included aye ko party joint general secretary sein 
lwin and central executive committee members tun tin and kyaw htin 
all hold senior government positions 
in its broadcast radio rangoon said the delegates had empowered 
the partys central committee to consider sweeping proposals for 
economic reform th radio did not say whether a decision had been 
taken 
in his remarks aye ko said 15 delegates expressed opposition to 
holding the proposed referendum on oneparty rule on the grounds 
that a 1973 referendum already had institutionalized it 
the state radio announced sunday that an emergency parliament 
session would convene wednesday apparently to act on the 
referendum proposal 
according to burmese law the parliament is empowered to rule on 
the referendum by majority vote in the past the parliament has 
rubberstamped most of the ruling partys decisions 
the emergency session wednesday could also deal with the 
appointment of a new president to replace san yu 
exactly when ne win will be replaced or by whom remains unclear 
analysts have said a likely candidate would be maung maung kha the 
prime minister since 1977 maung maung kha has generally not been 
regarded as an effective leader 
many western diplomats doubt that ne win who has been in 
undisputed control of the country for so long will remain far 
removed from policy decisions even after he leaves the government 
the sudden and unexpected developments in burma came in the wake 
of bloody antigovernment riots that have rocked rangoon and other 
cities three times since october martial law is still in effect in 
prome 180 miles north of the capital following riots there last 
week 
during his 26year rule ne win not only crushed antigovernment 
opposition but moved against leaders within his own ranks when they 
exhibited what he saw as too much independence 
he also is blamed for turning resourcerich burma into one of 
the nations 10 poorest countries with an annual per capita income 
of less than 200 
in a speech sunday aye ko admitted economic production had 
declined working skills had deteriorated and losses and waste 
cannot be controlled effectively 
because of these weaknesses and as a result of adverse 
repercussions from the world economic conditions today the state 
economic situation is declining he said 
he called for an end to state control of many sectors and for 
allowing joint ventures between burmese entrepreneurs and foreign 
investors ne win banned such ventures shortly after seizing power

africa and the united states met on an island off the coast of 
africa to discuss the next moves in an evolving peace accord in 
southwestern africa the state department confirmed monday 
the united states which is acting as a mediator was 
represented at the july 2223 meeting by a joint delegation from 
the defense and state departments headed by james l woods the 
deputy assistant secretary of defense for african affairs state 
department spokesman charles redman said 
redman said the talks on the island of cape verde were 
complementary to the diplomatic negotiations under way for a 
withdrawal of cuban and south african troops from angola and 
independence for southwest africa also known as namibia 
a further round of politicallevel talks will be held between 
the sides in geneva next week although cuba angola and south 
africa have accepted the principle of withdrawal they are still 
wrangling over timetables 
redman did not elaborate on what the military officials 
discussed at the meeting which was first disclosed over the 
weekend by the portuguese news agency lusa 
one of the matters which probably was on the agenda is the 
proximity of some of the estimated 50000 cuban troops to south 
african forces in southern angola 
us officials have voiced concern that the two sides might 
clash thereby escalating the conflict and scuttling the diplomatic 
breakthrough

a man charged with illegally aiding 
the nicaraguan contra rebels pleaded innocent monday and said his 
operations were approved all the way to the top of the white 
house 
jack terrell 47 is one of seven men indicted on charges of 
violating the us neutrality act by secretly aiding the contras in 
1984 and 1985 
this is a case of right and wrong terrell said after 
appearing before a federal magistrate the soldiers are going to 
be hung and the generals will walk 
terrells attorney john mattes questioned why former national 
security council aide oliver north and other reagan administration 
figures connected to the irancontra arms deal were not charged in 
the case which covers a period when congress had banned military 
aid to the contras 
knowledge and approval of the aid operation went all the way 
to the top of the white house said terrell asked if he meant 
the president terrell repeated his statement 
the former mercenary who used the code name colonel flaco 
said he received about 100000 for the operations and added it 
did not come from private sources 
terrells defense also showed a document declassified during the 
congressional investigation into the irancontra affair saying it 
supports their contention that north was aware of the secret 
activities 
the jan 27 1985 memo to north which is unsigned but which 
the defense says came from norths aide robert owen specifically 
mentions terrells codefendant tom posey head of civilian 
materiel assistance of alabama 
the memo says posey is sending 4 people to censored to help 
with the training and asks norths approval of their departure 
date 
it adds that flaco is going to be working with the indians 
an apparent reference to the antisandinista miskito indians on 
nicaraguas eastern coast 
terrell said it was that operation that led to his 
disenchantment with the governments anticontra policies 
they were not interested in getting nicaragua back terrell 
said they were interested in creating a situation in which the 
american military would have to come in 
he said north had him thrown out of his base in honduras with 
uzi submachine guns pointed at our heads because his operations 
were getting off the railroad track 
terrell later began speaking out against reagan administration 
policy on nicaragua and in subsequent memos north wrote that he 
had to be stopped 
a terrell codefendant joe adams was sentenced friday to one 
day of probation and fined 50 by us district judge norman 
roettger who could have sentenced him to 33 years in prison 
terrell faces the same possible penalty as adams but said he 
would not plead guilty despite adams lenient treatment 
i wont take a felony said terrell 
mattes said the defense would subpoena witnesses and documents 
from government agencies including the cia and the national 
security council

the captains of a japanese submarine and a pleasure 
fishing boat probably share blame for a weekend collision that 
killed nine people and left 21 missing a maritime safety agency 
official said monday 
a senior defense official said the submarines crewmen should 
have done more to save the people in the fishing boat and were slow 
to notify rescue officials 
the 2200ton sub nadashio and the 154ton no 1 fujimaru 
collided headon saturday southwest of tokyo while the submarine 
was running on the surface 
some of the 48 people on the boat were thrown into the water and 
the boat sank in two minutes those missing are presumed dead 
no injuries were reported among the subs 75 crewmen 
the investigation isnt complete yet but it looks like both 
vessels were partly responsible for the accident the msa 
official said speaking on condition of anonymity 
divers recovered the bodies of three more victims monday in the 
waters near yokosuka about 30 miles southwest of tokyo 
rescue officials said 200 divers were searching for the 21 
people still missing and others were on the ocean floor attaching 
cables to the hull of the 154ton no 1 fujimaru so it could be 
raised 
seiki nishihiro vice minister of state for defense said the 
subs crew was slow to tell rescue officials of the accident 
because its communications equipment only allowed it to talk to 
naval headquarters not to the safety agency 
men on the sub should have grabbed three or four life 
preservers if they were available and jumped into the water to 
save people from the fishing boat nishihiro told reporters 
twentyone minutes elapsed before the safety agency was told of 
the collision according to news reports 
sixteen of the 19 people rescued were picked up by passing 
vessels and only three by the submarine the reports said one of 
those rescued died later 
the nadashio was crossing a busy shipping lane to enter yokosuka 
naval base and was trying to avoid hitting a yacht when it collided 
with the boat which a company fishing club had chartered for the 
weekend adm shuichiro higashiyama said sunday 
he said the fishing boat had not made an unexpected turn 
japanese maritime rules require the ship approaching from the 
left to take evasive action when two vessels appear to be on a 
collision course with the other maintaining its course unless an 
accident is imminent 
in saturdays accident the sub was approaching from the left 
and took such action but the fishing boat also turned and a 
collision resulted 
if the no 1 fujimaru had not turned to the left there would 
not have been a collision a defense agency official quoted 
higashiyama as saying i believe the submarine commander took the 
most appropriate measures to avoid an accident

researchers have identified genetic 
mutations that lead to the development of colon cancer a critical 
step toward the development of better treatments for a form of 
cancer that kills 53500 americans annually 
you can look at these genetic alterations as the causes of 
cancer just as you can look at bacteria as the causes of 
infection said dr bert vogelstein of the johns hopkins 
university school of medicine in baltimore except its more 
complicated in cancer 
just as the polio virus had to be discovered before the polio 
vaccine could be developed so these genetic changes must be found 
before cancer can be prevented vogelstein said monday in a 
telephone interview 
research so far suggests that perhaps as many as seven genetic 
mutations must occur for olon cancer tumors to appear vogelstein 
said 
five of those changes have now been identified said ray white 
of the howard hughes medical institute at the university of utah in 
salt lake city 
speaking monday at the jackson laboratory here white said that 
colon cancer appears to be caused both by the activation of known 
cancer genes and by the failure of certain anticancer genes 
the steps in the pathway are starting to be filled in white 
said 
understanding how these genetic changes produce colon tumors may 
allow doctors to distinguish between more severe and less severe 
forms of colon cancer in individuals white said and could one day 
lead to better cancer drugs 
white has been one of the leaders in the study of the 
anticancer genes that protect against cancer the socalled 
recessive oncogenes 
one such gene identified in a rare form of eye cancer has now 
been linked to breast cancer and to a common form of lung cancer 
white said 
another such gene was found by white in families with a rare 
kind of inherited colon cancer 
now he said failures of that anticolon cancer gene have been 
found to occur in about half of the much more common form of colon 
cancer that is not inherited 
similarly vogelstein said he has found two specific genetic 
variations in at least 75 percent of people with colon cancer 
he has also found that a longknown cancer gene called the kras 
gene is altered in about half of the colon cancer cases he has 
studied 
that kind of mutation is probably very important for the 
development of colon cancer vogelstein said and it suggests 
some relationship between environmental influences and cancer 
cancer is known to be caused in part by exposure to 
carcinogens in the environment he explained such carcinogens 
could be triggering some of the genetic mutations that he and white 
are finding he said 
white said that some of these changes may produce polyps in the 
colon these polyps of the type that president reagan has had 
removed are thought to represent tissue in which some but not 
all of the colon cancer genetic mutations are present 
vogelstein said statistical studies of colon cancer suggest that 
perhaps no more than seven genetic mutations are required to 
produce colon cancer tumors 
with five of those changes now identified researchers may be 
close to identifying all of the principal genetic causes of colon 
cancer he said opening the way to research on new and better 
treatments for this disease

an owner of a printing plant faces 
forgery charges in a scheme to print and sell 3 million in 50 and 
100 bills a federal agent said monday 
we believe we got all of it that none of it was put into 
circulation said stewart henry of the secret services regional 
office in boston 
richard p edmands a watertown resident and coowner of the 
reproprint co was to be arraigned monday on charges of 
manufacturing counterfeit us currency and possession of forgery 
plates and tools henry said 
edmands was arrested sunday when an undercover secret service 
agent went to reproprint after arranging to pay 50000 in cash for 
the 3 million in counterfeit bills henry said 
the quality was average to good they were very passable 
henry said the quality of a forged bill depends largely on the 
quality of the camera that is used to produce a negative from which 
the printing plates are made he said 
the paper did not contain the red and blue security fibers 
but it was a good rag paper henry said the us treasury uses 
special dies and fibers to make us currency difficult to 
duplicate 
henry said he could not comment on what led to the investigation

workers dusted off idled machinery shops reopened 
and buses rolled monday as armenians in nagornokarabakh quit a 
twomonth strike that failed to persuade the kremlin to transfer 
the region to the control of a neighboring republic 
one resident said armenians wont give up despite the soviet 
leaderships rejection a week ago of their demand to take 
nagornokarabakh out of the republic of azerbaijan and annex it to 
armenia 
the decision has done little for us and we will continue this 
fight to the end but what is the sense of continuing to strike 
said an engineer for the state broadcasting committee in 
stepanakert the main city in the delawaresized disputed region 
the decision by armenians to end the protest strikes marks a 
victory for the kremlin in its drive to end the regions turmoil 
that erupted in february 
the strikes have devastated the local economy the tass news 
agency reported monday that at one stepanakert factory lighting 
fixtures worth more than 79 million had not been produced since 
the work stoppage began may 23 the factory director was quoted as 
saying employees will work overtime to make up for the lost 
production 
tass said 785 percent of the employees reported to work at 
stepanakerts 15 major factories 
but the news agency said it will take time to resume full 
production at the longidled plants 
workers at a stepanakert silk factory spent two hours monday 
morning cleaning a thick layer of dust from their looms and have 
other maintenance work to do before production is back to normal 
tass reported 
the presidium of the supreme soviet the nations parliament 
decided july 18 that nagornokarabakh whose population of 162000 
is predominantly armenian and christian will remain part of the 
mostly moslem azerbaijani republic to which it has been attached 
since 1923 
the presidium or executive committee also decided to dispatch 
a representative to nagornokarabakh to help authorities implement 
a plan approved in march for improving social and cultural 
facilities primarily for armenians soviet tv reported monday that 
arkady i volsky a 56yearold member of the policymaking central 
committee and a supreme soviet deputy would go to the region 
armenians in nagornokarabakh began sporadic strikes and rallies 
in february to press for annexation with armenia contending they 
suffered discrimination under the azerbaijanis strikes and rallies 
also erupted in armenia in support of the demand 
tass said buses began running again food stores and other 
businesses reopened and construction workers returned to their 
jobs monday in stepanakert 
today people went to work the broadcast engineer said in a 
telephone interview transport is operating and we have ended our 
strikes she declined to give her name 
the regions communist party officials traveled to the 
azerbaijani capital of baku to discuss with the republics leaders 
efforts at restoring a normal working rhythm and strenghtening 
socialist legality and public order tass said 
in the armenian capital of yerevan most workers were reported 
back on the job after a strike that began july 4 and tapered off

the federal governments decision to allow those 
who suffer from aids to import unproved drugs is a response to the 
gay communitys frustrations about the search for a cure to the 
deadly disease according to advocates for aids victims 
larry gostin an attorney with the harvard school of public 
health called the new program a signal advance in recognizing 
the gay and ivdrug constituencies that have been calling for 
this and grants aids patients a little bit of hope and 
reprieve 
the government last week officially began allowing aids patients 
to import drugs not approved for sale in the united states as long 
as the drugs are for personal use 
us food and drug administration commissioner frank e young 
revealed the change saturday to a hostile crowd at the second 
international lesbian and gay health conference and aids forum in 
boston he said the policy would also apply to drugs for other 
diseases 
its almost a shock because its so contrary to the character 
and the tradition of the fda said 
it allows aids patients to make some choices about their own 
treatment said ellen ratner president of the national lesbian 
and gay health foundation which is sponsoring the conference on 
gay health issues 
if youre dying you dont have a lot of choices ratner 
said 
the fda had been repeatedly criticized by advocates of aids 
patients who say the government is not moving quickly enough to 
develop and test new drugs to treat the fatal incurable disease 
increasingly desperate patients have been eager to try 
experimental treatment and young said the fda was changing its 
policy even though scientists believe many of the drugs have not 
been proved safe and effective 
from the aids persons point of view they have nothing to 
lose and what they need is just some little optimism in their life 
if theres a risk i think that they should be able to make the 
decision about whether to assume that risk gostin said sunday 
winfield scott associate dean for education at george 
washington university medical center said the change responds to 
gay communitys frustration that answers arent coming more 
quickly 
scott cautioned that although activists focus on the bureaucracy 
as if the bureaucracy was the problem the real problem is that 
nature is very slow and reluctant to yield up her secrets 
young said the fda had previously allowed unapproved drugs to be 
imported on an informal basis one such drug was dextran sulfate 
which the federal government is only now beginning to test in human 
trials as a treatment for aids 
the fdas new policy will insure that people in need can import 
a small supply generally enough for three months of treatment the 
drugs must be only for personal use and not for sale 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a 
virus that damages the bodys immune system leaving victims 
susceptible to infections and cancer it is spread most often 
through sexual contact needles or syringes shared by drug abusers 
infected blood or blood products and from pregnant women to their 
offspring 
homosexual or bisexual males account for 62 percent of the 
68220 us aids cases counted by the government since june 1981 
there have been 38541 deaths or 56 percent of the total cases 
the centers for disease control reported last week

a simmering feud between beef producers and 
dairymen has surfaced as congress wrestles with legislation to aid 
droughtstricken farmers 
a group of beef cattlemen based in texas has asked congress to 
limit concessions to the dairymen while the nations largest dairy 
farm cooperative says additional government help is necessary to 
avoid milk shortages and higher prices at the grocery store 
james l powell president of the texas and southwestern cattle 
raisers association in fort worth has asked texas congressmen 
including house agriculture committee chairman kika de la garza to 
oppose concessions to the dairymen that extend beyond suspension of 
a 50cent cut in milk price supports and existing drought relief 
assistance programs 
those programs include haying and grazing on land set aside from 
production and governmentsubsidized feed expenses in 
droughtstricken counties 
further concessions are unwarranted powell wrote de la 
garza a democrat in a july 20 letter 
jim eskin spokesman for associated milk producers inc of san 
antonio texas the nations largest dairy farm cooperative said 
the group is asking congress to not only suspend the 50cent cut in 
price supports scheduled to take effect jan 1 but to increase 
price supports by about 106 per 100 pounds of milk 
the dairy association contends the additional support is 
necessary to offset increasing feed costs caused by the drought 
eskin said monday other industry officials say production has also 
been decreased because of the heat 
a failure to act would be shortsighted and could result in 
letting milk production drop to dangerously low levels which 
could lead to runaway prices for years to come eskin said 
if farmers cant afford or obtain feed they may be forced to 
slaughter their herds which can take three years to rebuild he 
said 
he said there has been heavy movement of dairy cattle to 
slaughter further documenting a rapidly deteriorating situation 
the house agriculture committee is scheduled to complete action 
on droughtrelief legislation tuesday with the bill possibly being 
considered by the full house on thursday 
jim sumner spokesman for dairymen inc said the louisvlle 
ky cooperative is reporting shortages this week and is 81tanker 
trailers of milk below what is needed to fill orders in the 
southeast and midatlantic 
powell said the cattle raisers dont think the dairymen should 
be given favorable treatment over and above any other segment of 
agriculture were trying to maintain a level playing field for all 
agriculture 
the secretary of agriculture has enough authority to deal with 
the drought situation were not really certain you need additional 
legislation powell said 
the dairymen and beefcattle producers have been at odds off and 
on for several years partly over an 18month wholeherd buyout of 
dairy cattle that began april 1 1986 about 122 million cows 
heifers and calves were sold mostly for slaughter and some for 
export during the buyout dairy farmers collected about 18 
billion in subsidies and about 38 percent of that cost was paid for 
by dairy farmers themselves through milk marketing fees levied on 
all producers the subsidies however went to only those in the 
program 
the cattle producers contended the buyout flooded the market 
with beef and depressed prices 
don king general manager of the texas and southwest cattle 
raisers contends an increase in price supports could encourage 
production and lead to another wholeherd dairy buyout 
weve already gone through that ringer two years ago he 
said 
a national consumer group public voice for food and health 
policy also said droughthurt dairy farmers deserve some federal 
aid such as feed assistance but legislating a higher dairy 
support price is not justifiable 
once again the dairy producers are going whole hog for a 
special deal that would cost americans more as taxpayers and a 
consumers said public voice executive director ellen haas and 
higher food prices impact hardest on those least able to pay 
mandating higher support prices for milk after feed costs slacken 
would once again encourage overproduction and government costs

president reagan said monday the time has come 
for the united states to talk to iran about americans held hostage 
in lebanon if tehrans leaders are willing and ready 
reagan did not elaborate but an administration official noted 
earlier in the day that the united states had sent a new message to 
iran last week asking about the possibility of talks aimed at 
normalizing relations tehran still has not sent an authorized 
reply the official said 
the official who asked not be identified said the united 
states would like to talk to the iranians about ending the persian 
gulf war the nine americans held hostage in lebanon and 
terrorism but he said the us message did not specify conditions 
for a resumption of relations severed in 1980 
as he was leaving a white house rose garden ceremony honoring 
participants in the american legions boys nation program reagan 
was asked are you ready to talk to iran about the hostages is 
it time 
if theyre willing and ready to talk its time he replied 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said theres really 
nothing new on the fate of the americans held captive in lebanon 
by proiranian extremists 
but fitzwater reiterated that in the wake of irans acceptance 
of a un security council resolution calling for a ceasefire in 
the protracted iraniraq war american officials have been hopeful 
that a dialogue could be established with the government of 
revolutionary leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
on sunday defense secretary frank c carlucci said improved 
usiranian relations could lead to the release of the nine 
americans including the aps middle east correspondent terry 
anderson who has been held since march 16 1985 longer than any 
other american 
we have consistently said that were prepared to enter into a 
dialogue with iran carlucci said all they have to do is 
designate somebody who is officially empowered to talk to us and 
wed be glad to talk with them about policy issues about 
terrorism about bringing peace to the region about whatever is 
appropriate 
asked about speculation the us hostages might be released if 
the war ends carlucci said were obviously not going to discuss 
any quid pro quo but if the irnians want to talk to us about the 
hostage situation and how theyre going to go about influencing 
their release wed be delighted to talk to them about it im not 
in the slightest suggesting that there would be any deal for the 
hostages that is contrary to our policy 
fitzwater took the same stand in answering reporters questions 
monday 
our position remains the same that were always available to 
talk any time any place about the safety or the release of the 
hostages but we will not negotiate for them and we dont anticipate 
any negotiations he said 
we wont negotiate we wont pay ransom we wont talk quid 
pro quos we wont give or take he said the answer to release 
of the hostages is to release them its not a complex matter 
they took them off the streets they can put them back on the 
streets 
reagan has persistently denied that his approval of the 
clandestine sales of us arms to iran in 1985 and 1986 amounted to 
an armsforhostages deal but a presidential commission headed by 
former sen john tower rtexas concluded there was such a 
linkage and so did congress 
two hostages the rev benjamin weir and david jacobsen were 
released during the time of the transfers of us arms to iran 
which led to the subsequent diversion of sales proceeds to 
nicaraguan rebels and eventually the reagan administrations 
worst scandal

palestinians clashed with israeli troops in the 
occupied territories monday and three arabs and five israeli 
soldiers were hurt hospital officials and military spokesmen said 
the clashes came as the army released 148 palestinian prisoners 
from a desert detention camp in a goodwill gesture for a key moslem 
holiday 
most of mondays violence focused on the seaside gaza strip 
in the shati refugee camp in gaza city residents stoned an army 
patrol seriously injuring one officer who suffered a cracked 
skull an army spokesman said 
in response troops fired tear gas and live ammunition wounding 
a 12yearold and a 15yearold boy both in the legs arab 
hospital officials said the army confirmed one shooting and said 
it was checking reports of the second 
more than a dozen shati residents were treated for beating 
injuries or tear gas inhalation doctors at gaza citys shifa 
hospital said they said troops surrounded the hospital apparently 
to search for protesters 
in the jabliya refugee camp a frequent site of violence on the 
outskirts of gaza city arab stonethrowers forced an army jeep to 
veer out of control and turn over injuring four military police 
an army spokesman said 
the spokesman said the driver lost control of his vehicle after 
a rock injured his hand 
two of the injured policemen were taken to a hospital and two 
were treated at the scene the spokesman said he spoke on 
condition of anonymity in keeping with military regulations 
the army immediately clamped a curfew on jabaliya forcing the 
camps 60000 residents to stay indoors 
in the central west bank village of deir ammar residents hurled 
stones and bottles at an army patrol troops opened fire wounding 
a protester the army said 
doctors at nearby ramallah hospital said the 22yearold man was 
shot in the abdomen 
the freed palestinian prisoners were taken in five buses from 
the ketziot detention camp in the southern negev desert to military 
headquarters in gaza city where they were welcomed by hundreds of 
friends and relatives 
when some of the prisoners went home to the nearby shati refugee 
camp they were greeted by arabs shouting proplo slogans and the 
army fired tear gas to disperse the crowd witnesses said 
some of the detainees had been jailed without trial and the 
rest had served short sentences on charges of antiisraeli violence 
during the 7month uprising 
since the rebellion began in december 233 palestinians and four 
israelis have died 
the prisoner release came on the second day of the fourday 
moslem holiday eid aladha or feast of sacrifice the holiday 
marks what is described in the koran islams holy book as gods 
request to abraham to sacrifice his son ismail 
the army says 6400 palestinians are currently being held by 
israel among them 2500 jailed for up to six months without trial 
the army said monday it has computerized its prison records to 
deal with the dramatic increase in the number of palestinians 
detained since the uprising 
lawyers have complained they spend weeks tracking down clients 
because of sloppy army records and indifferent officials the 
englishlanguage daily jerusalem post quoted army officials as 
saying information on prisoners can now be obtained within two days 
but felicia langer an israeli lawyer who represents palestinian 
prisoners said problems persisted she said prison officials often 
did not notify her about the whereabouts of her clients 
curfews remained in effect monday in beit jalla where 10000 
palestinians live nearby beit sahur home to 12000 and nablus 
the west banks largest city with 120000 residents

sales of existing homes rose in june to the 
highest level in a year and a half as buyers tried to beat out 
rising mortgage interest rates a real estate trade group reported 
monday 
the national association of realtors said existing singlefamily 
homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 378 
million units last month a 53 percent increase over may 
it was the fifth consecutive monthly increase and the highest 
level since homes sold at a rate of 406 million units in december 
1986 
in may sales rose a revised 20 percent to a rate of 359 
million units an earlier estimate had put the gain at 31 percent 
the anticipation of continued rising interest rates convinced 
homebuyers to get into the market now rather than waiting said 
john a tuccillo the trade groups chief economist 
but in fact rates did not increase as much as anticipated 
creating an added incentive for homebuyers he said 
rates for fixedrate 30year mortgages averaged 1046 percent 
last week up only about a half of a percentage point from recent 
lows in march according to the federal home loan mortgage corp 
the average does not include addon fees known as points 
however many analysts are predicting rates will edge up by 
another half or full percentage point by the end of the year 
curtailing sales 
i would not be suprised if july gave us a level perhaps as 
strong as june but i think over the remainder of the year were 
going to see those mortgage interest rates move upward and were 
going to see housing market activity trailing off as a result 
said richard peach an economist with the mortgage bankers 
association of america 
june sales were 56 percent higher than a year ago the first 
time in 12 months that the sales pace beat the previous years mark 
for the first six months existing homes sold at a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 344 million units up from 341 million in 
the last half of 1987 
there were 353 million homes sold for all of last year down 
slightly from 356 million in 1986 which was the best since 1979 
most economists are expecting sales of about 340 million this year 
theres been a clear tapering off but we arent in the 
doldrums we havent had a housing bust by any means said mark 
obrinsky an economist with the us league of savings institutions 
the strong sales came amid other indications of weakness in the 
housing market the annual rate of construction of new 
singlefamily homes during the first half of 1988 was down 64 
percent from the julydecember rate of last year 
peach said much of the demand for new housing that built up when 
interest rates soared early in the 1980s has been satisified he 
said existing homes sales are still relatively high in part because 
of strong job growth and people moving to accept new and better 
jobs 
the june sales increase was led by a rise of 92 percent in the 
south to 143 million units followed by gains of 87 percent in 
the midwest to 100 million units and 78 percent in the west to 
690000 units 
sales declined 28 percent in the northeast to an annual sales 
pace of 700000 units 
the median price of an existing home rose 1800 from may to 
june climbing to 90600 up 20 percent the median price was up 
55 percent from 85900 a year ago 
of the four regions the west had the highest appreciation rate 
over the past year with a median sales price of 125100 up 91 
percent from june 1987 the midwest posted a 73 percent gain to 
70600 while in the northeast the price rose 59 percent to

israel has denied visas to 150 jews stranded in 
ethiopia claiming they are not jewish by orthodox law a 
legislator said monday 
mattityahu peled a retired general in the israeli army and a 
member of the leftwing progressive movement for peace said the 
ethiopians have relatives in israel and have waited several months 
in addis ababa ethiopias capital for visas to the jewish state 
he said us jewish leaders apparently assured the ethiopians 
the visas would be issued the ethiopians then abandoned their 
homes and most of their belongings to assemble in addis ababa 
but ultraorthodox jewish officials at israels interior 
ministry decided against issuing the visas saying the ethiopians 
are not jewish peled told the associated press 
people are suffering because their families are divided 
peled said those who are mixed up in this have no way back we 
cant just leave them hanging in the air 
about 7500 ethiopian jews were flown to israel four years ago 
in a secret rescue operation codenamed operation moses and 
about 10000 jews remain in that african country according to 
official estimates 
immigration and absorption minister yaacov tsur denounced 
peleds remarks monday as a blood libel israeli officials 
consistently refuse to discuss emigration from ethiopia fearing 
publicity could harm the effort 
peled said his information came from the san francisco office of 
the usbased american jewish congress an organization that has 
been active in trying to help ethiopian jews emigrate part of the 
information he received was published here by the respected daily 
haaretz 
david clayman a spokesman for the american jewish congress in 
jerusalem quoted ajc president robert k lifton in new york as 
saying the organizations head office was unaware of the matter 
raised by peled 
but an official source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
confirmed peleds story 
tsur sent clayman a telegram protesting the report saying it 
shamed israels name ministry spokesman gad benari said 
i checked this matter with all the authorities involved and i 
was assured unequivocally that there is no truth to this report 
the telegram said 
many of the estimated 16000 ethiopian jews in israel have faced 
discrimination from israeli rabbis who often do not recognize them 
as jewish claiming they cannot document their descendancy from the 
ancient faith 
the ethiopians claim they are descendants of the biblical king 
solomon and the queen of sheba who lived in the 10th century bc 
peled said many of the jews left in ethiopia could be brought to 
israel if not for interior ministry officials who belong to the 
ultraorthodox party shas and have sole jurisdiction over visas 
ethiopia is allied with israels arab enemies and thus reluctant 
to permit jews to come here

a coalition of bigcity police chiefs and 
criminologists said monday that congress and president reagan are 
throwing money at antidrug programs whose effectiveness never has 
been tested 
the coalition in a letter sent to members of congress and the 
white house urged that money be earmarked for research and 
development in the war on drugs to find out which programs are most 
effective 
we are calling on the federal government to do what it is not 
doing now to include money for research and bring 
reflection and thought to our policy on drugs anthony v bouza 
chief of police in minneapolis said at a news conference where the 
letter was released 
the coalition said 5 percent of total federal antidrug funds 
should be set aside for research and development congress is 
expected to approve at least 1 billion for the war against drugs 
in the next fiscal year 
research could help determine how best to reduce demand for 
drugs which treatment programs are most effective in keeping drug 
addicts from committing crimes and determine the costs and benefits 
of massive police crackdowns on drugdealing locations the police 
chiefs said in their letter 
throwing more money into existing programs will not answer 
these and other critical questions the group said we urge you 
to invest in better strategic knowledge for winning this war 
the current war on drugs is characterized by defeat bouza 
said because of the lack of a coherent policy police need to know 
whether massive roundups of suspected drug dealers and raids on 
suspected drug operations are effective in deterring drug dealing 
he said 
the letter was signed by 46 police chiefs sheriffs law 
enforcement representatives and criminologists

backers of george bush and pat robertson 
who feuded for months over the michigan delegation to the 
republican national convention agreed monday to greater 
representation for robertsons supporters in a show of unity that 
officials hope will ensure a winning gop ticket in november 
the agreement reached after weeks of negotiations between the 
two factions gives the former republican presidential candidate 13 
of the states 77 delegate votes at next months convention 
vice president george bush the virtual nominee gets the 
remainder of the delegates 
having this agreement behind us now really clears the deck 
said state party chair spencer abraham it allows us to continue 
on using the time until new orleans to develop the michigan 
campaign 
lori packer the michigan director of americans for robertson 
said the robertson camp was convinced a credentials fight over 
delegates would hamper the partys mission electing the republican 
ticket in november 
our differences are minimal compared to what we face in the 
fall ms packer said proving we are right at the expense 
of having michael dukakis as the leader of the free world is a 
price that were not willing to pay 
in the early stages of michigans twoyear delegateselection 
process the robertson forces matched the bush forces in recruiting 
precinct delegates to the county conventions 
that led to a temporary shift of party leadership a series of 
lawsuits and in january a dramatic split at the state convention 
robertsonbacking republicans joined by some supporters of new 
york rep jack kemp broke from the main gop group held their own 
state convention and planned a credentials challenge in new orleans 
as part of the agreement announced monday the renegade 
rpublicans agreed to put the only remaining lawsuit on hold for 
nine months and the national party agreed to give nonvoting 
honorary delegate status to about 30 of the renegade delegates 
who have made transportation and hotel arrangements for the 
convention 
of the five delegates who relinquished seats four were from the 
kemp camp and one was a bush delegate former gov george romney 
in addition two delegates gave up their membership on convention 
committees in favor of robertson backers 
bush has amassed more than the 1139 delegates needed to win the 
nomination but robertson who returned to his evangelical 
television program since dropping out of the presidential race has 
not released his delegates 
the 13 michigan delegates remain bound to vote for robertson 
unless he says otherwise according to ms packer 
it hasnt been made clear to me what his intentions are she 
said

people who want to claim a body from the 
coroners office will first have to identify the corpse in a photo 
lineup under guidelines established after a woman gained custody of 
a body to fake her own death certificate 
the los angeles county coroner now also requires people wishing 
to claim a body to show a drivers license and have fingerprints 
taken 
officials said that while they are sympathetic to grieving 
families the new rules are necessary to prevent a similar scam in 
the future 
the stricter standards came about after a woman trying to avoid 
creditors and probation officers gained custody of an unidentified 
body and tried to have her name registered as the deceased 
sharon hall and her mother helene tilch were sentenced july 14 
after pleading guilty to one count each of false personation or 
creating a nonexistent person 
ms hall 35 received a twoyear sentence and ms tilch who 
is 58 and in a wheelchair got 16 months 
ms hall used the name sharon agee called the coroners office 
in december and said she was looking for her dead sister the 
investigator asked for a description of the dead woman and ms hall 
essentially described herself 
her height hair color and general description a heavyset 
white woman in her mid30s matched that of an unidentified body 
unclaimed since its discovery oct 25 alongside a highway the 
woman apparently died of a drug overdose 
ms hall and her mother were very emotional when shown the body 
they were good at their craft said philip spada a 
supervising coroners investigator and their craft was scamming 
people 
the coroners office which handles 17000 to 20000 bodies a 
year released the body to the two women who had it cremated and 
mailed the death certificate to ms halls probation officers 
prosecutors said 
sacramento county probation officer karen raquel ordered a copy 
of the autopsy report and the results showed the dead woman had 
undergone a hysterectomy and was covered with tattoos raquel knew 
the two characteristics did not fit ms hall and called police 
the dead womans ashes have been returned to the coroners 
office where they will remain should the womans real relatives 
come forward

the senate on monday voted to delay a national 
marine fisheries service requirement that shrimp fishermen use 
devices to prevent sea turtles from being snared and drowned in 
nets 
under an amendment proposed by sen howell heflin dala 
shrimp boats would not have to use turtle excluder devices in 
offshore waters before may 1 1989 or in inshore waters before may 
1 1990 
approved by voice vote the language represented a compromise 
worked out by heflin and sen george mitchell dmaine floor 
manager of legislation to reauthorize and strengthen the endangered 
species act 
the compromise which also provides for a national academy of 
sciences study of sea turtle populations and the value of turtle 
excluders allowed the senate to begin debate on the endangered 
species legislation similar to a housepassed bill 
backers of the endangered species act had been trying for more 
than three years to get a bill to the senate floor to renew the 
1972 law which has technically lacked legislative authorization 
since oct 1 1985 
the house version of the reauthorization bill contains a ban on 
requiring turtle excluders in inshore waters before may 1990 a 
us district court in louisiana last april issued a temporary 
injunction against the fisheries service requiring use of teh 
excluders in offshore waters 
conservationists argue that the sea turtle population is being 
decimated by shrimp nets shrimpers contend that excluder devices 
are dangerous to the operation of their vessels reduce shrimp 
catches and are unnecessary for turtle survival 
senate leaders gave no indication when they expected to complete 
work on the reauthorization bill

president reagan said monday that some 
features of droughtrelief legislation violate principles he laid 
out for a package of aid to financially troubled farmers 
in a letter to the leaders of the house and senate agriculture 
committees reagan said i am concerned that due to the 
undeniable pressure to produce a bill as quickly as possible some 
provisions were incorporated without adequate review 
the president did not spell out which provisions of the 
bipartisan legislative package were bothering him although he had 
said previously that this humanitarian assistance should not be 
used as a means to other ends 
extraneous matters such as rewriting the existing farm bill 
will only deter our efforts to provide this muchneeded aid 
reagan said in the letter to sens patrick leahy dvt and 
richard lugar rind the letter also was sent to reps kika de la 
garza dtexas and edward madigan rill 
we hope that the congress shares our drought relief objectives 
and will continue to work the administration to enact them promptly 
into law reagan said in the letter 
during a tour of droughtstricken corn and soybean crops in 
southern illinois earlier this month reagan voiced concern that 
the relief package might take on the appearance of a christmas 
tree in which lawmakers attach favored amendments on legislation 
they know will pass the congress 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said monday that 
administration officials expect congress to resume work on the 
legislative package this week 
he said the house is a little ahead of the senate but were 
hopeful for good progress this week on the drought legislation 
meanwhile reagan got an updated report on the drought from 
agriculture secretary richard e lyng who has returned from a 
10state tour of midwestern drought areas 
at the same time the agriculture department named indiana as 
the fifth state to be designated entirely as a drought disaster 
area the designation means eligible farms can apply for emergency 
loans from the farmers home administration other entire states 
already approved are alabama missouri ohio and wisconsin 
the white house press office said in a statement that lyng 
presented reagan with pictures the task force had taken of corn 
damage in several states 
pasture and hay are in very bad condition causing real 
problems for livestock farmers lyng told reagan even the best 
corn is not in very good shape the rains of last week are helping 
but it may be too late for corn to recover 
lyng also told the president that some soybeans will recover 
but there still will be large losses the secretary said it 
probably would be another month before the government can make hard 
estimates of crop losses

us rep claudine c schneider told the 
state board of elections on monday that she signed her 1986 
candidacy declaration with the same signature that has jeopardized 
her 1988 candidacy 
schneider rri signed both forms with her middle initial 
which is not on her voter registration card and that was part of 
the trouble 
schneider also listed her narragansett address on the 1988 form 
as 56 central ave although as her registration reflects she 
actually lives on central street 
state law requires the two forms to match exactly and three 
minor candidates asked the board monday to disqualify schneider 
because of the discrepancies 
two other candidates sen john h chafee rri and 
democratic gubernatorial candidate bruce g sundlun have been 
challenged on similar grounds sundluns hearing was scheduled 
later monday and chafees for tuesday 
decisions on all three cases were expected wednesday 
schneider and her attorneys contend her 1988 candidacy cant be 
challenged because her 1986 candidacy went uncontested despite the 
signature discrepancy 
as i was about to put my signature on there i asked my staff 
how did i sign in 1986 and they said claudine c schneider 
she said 
the 1986 form listed her address as central street and the 
congresswoman said she did not know how that error was made 
the best i can guess is i had a staff member fill out the 
form evidently its a typographical error schneider said 
mary beck clerk of the narragansett board of canvassers 
testified the board refused to certify schneiders candidacy 
because the law does not allow discrepancies 
but beck said there was never any question of fraud 
earlier this year the town and state board disqualified denise 
r felice a wouldbe jesse jackson delegate from the presidential 
primary for the same middleinitial error schneider made 
what was good for felice should be good for mr chafee and 
good for claudine schneider argued john j staradumsky one of 
those objecting to schneiders candidacy 
schneiders attorneys said the cases were different because 
schneider had relied on the earlier filing and because the 
objections to her candidacy were filed by three people who would 
not be affected by the decision rather than by primary opponents 
staradumsky is seeking chafees seat vincent j dubreuil is 
seeking a state senate seat and stephen robertson who filed the 
first objection to schneiders candidacy is running for her seat 
as a writein candidate

pinochet who is army commander and the heads of the air force and 
national police last week set the date for their august meeting

october under the 1980 constitution the vote must occur no less 
than 30 days and no more than 60 days after the nominee is chosen

september 1973 that ousted the late president salvador allende an 
elected marxist pinochets fellow commanders are gen fernando 
matthei of the air force adm jose merino of the navy and gen 
rodolfo stange national police commander

be made by majority decision of an eightmember national security 
council

chosen will begin an eightyear presidential term in march if not 
an open election will be held in 1990 when congressional elections 
are planned 
opposition politicians expressed no objections monday to a vote 
in october 
ricardo lagos a socialist told journalists the opposition had 
expected the referendum to be held sept 11 the 15th anniversary 
of the coup and a later date provided more time to campaign 
against it 
lagos is coleader of a coalition working for rejection of the 
military candidate it plans to make its own count of the vote with 
20000 volunteers serving as monitors at polling stations 
patricio aylwin president of the christian democratic party 
the countrys largest said announcing the nomination date so far 
in advance is good news but he and luis maira of the christian 
left party said the government must take other steps to ensure a 
fair vote 
a specific step they mentioned was lifting the state of 
emergency that allows the government to limit political activity 
and press freedom 
this will be the first vote for president since allende won the 
office in 1970 more than 6 million of the 8 million eligible 
voters have registered to participate

cincinnati archbishop daniel e pilarczyk 
underwent a fourhour brain operation monday to seal off a ruptured 
blood vessel that could have killed him if it had not been treated 
his chief surgeon said 
dr john m tew jr a pioneer in laser surgery who conducted 
the operation said pilarczyk could leave the hospital after a week 
and return to work in four to six weeks 
pilarczyk 53 was listed in good condition 
pilarczyk roman catholic archbishop since 1982 in the 
550000member archdiocese of cincinnati suffered the aneurysm 
near the base of his brain saturday while vacationing in 
gatlinburg tenn he was transported to the university of tennessee 
hospital in knoxville for initial treatment then was moved by 
helicopter sunday to good samaritan hospital in cincinnati a 
catholic hospital 
pilarczyk survived because his hemorrhaging stopped after the 
rupture and because of good treatment he received at the tennessee 
hospital tew told a news conference monday 
i really felt today like i was being guided i never saw an 
operation go so smoothly said tew chairman of neurosurgery at 
good samaritan 
tew said the medical team cut into pilarczyks skull and used 
two 5millimeter stainless steel clips to seal off the aneurysm a 
sac formed when a weakened blood vessel wall bulges that should 
prevent another rupture tew said 
doctors have bypassed the artery and rerouted the brains blood 
supply to another artery 
pilarczyk has an excellent prognosis and shows no signs of 
paralysis or other damage tew said 
there is no damage to the brain itself tew said he 
doesnt seem to have any trouble at all right now

the wall of the artery which gets thinner over time about 40000 
americans suffer blood vessel ruptures each year and approximately 
15000 of them die as a result 
auxiliary bishop james garland is running the archdiocese in

defense secretary frank c carlucci on monday 
outlined modest changes in pentagon contracting procedures designed 
to curb the types of abuses uncovered in the ongoing defense 
procurement investigation 
the new practices place strict limits on what the pentagon calls 
best and final offers that each company can make on specifc 
contracts carlucci told a news conference 
in the past contractors have been able to amend their final 
offers in consultation with the pentagon to change prices or 
technical specifications to meet defense department needs 
many of the alleged abuses disclosed in the current procurement 
investigation involved contractors who through improper activities 
by consultants learned the price or other specifics of bids by 
competing companies and used that information to submit a new 
best and final offer tailored to win contracts worth billions 
of dollars 
it is the best and final offer that seems to us to create the 
most intensive point in the competitive cycle carlucci said 
and that means that information is at a premium 
we intend to continue with our competitive process but when 
you repeat it once twice or three times then it can readily 
become subject to abuse carlucci said 
neither carlucci nor his aides were able to say how frequently 
companies were allowed to make more than than one best and final 
offer although he said it was the exception rather than the 
rule 
he said he envisioned further actions as more information is 
disclosed from the justice department investigation into 
allegations that defense contractors and consultants bribed 
pentagon officials for contracting details that could be vital in 
winning lucrative contracts 
carlucci who was due to testify before the house armed services 
committee on tuesday about steps he has taken to control 
contracting abuses previously had announced many of the steps that 
he outlined monday among those he mentioned monday the pentagon 
has 
required that 17 companies implicated by the investigation to 
certify they did not engage in illegal or improper activity to 
obtain a defense contract 
require those 17 to agree in any new contract greater than 
100000 to include a clause allowing the government recover 
profits or 10 percent of the contract value if the deal is tainted 
started procedures to lift the security clearances of six 
people including one suspended without pay from the navy 
department and five others transferred to other duties pending 
results of the investigation 
drawn up a protocol for the armed services to follow when new 
information is disclosed from the investigation 
sent letters to the top 200 defense contractors urging them to 
implement strong internal ethics programs stringent management 
controls and asking them to report back to us on their 
selfgovernance programs 
review federal acquisition regulations to tighten controls on 
consultants employed by defense contractors 
formed an audit task force to review the cost imposed on the 
military budget by consultants employed by private defense 
contractors 
carlucci said the certification requirement was being applied 
only to the 17 implicated companies to avoid imposing unneeded 
costs on contractors that were not under suspicion 
this is a rifle action it is not a shotgun action we are 
directing this at certain contractors we do not intend to apply it 
indiscriminately because it does impose a burden on people he 
said 
and where there are burdens there are costs and those costs 
may come back to the pentagon and the us taxpayer he said 
it is only where we have reason to believe that people are under 
suspicion that we are doing this 
we are going with a preaward certification for certain 
contractors basically those contractors whose premises have been 
searched he said 
carlucci declined to identify people whose security clearances 
were being lifted saying only that we are taking steps to revoke 
the security clearances of individuals who have been involved in 
illegal or improper actions 
in a related development the white house announced that 
president reagan intends to nominate milton l lohr to the new 
position of deputy undersecretary of defense for acquisition 
since 1983 lohr has been president of the defense research 
corp in la jolla calif before that he was executive vice 
president of flight systems inc from 1969 to 1983 
lohr a 63yearold native of revere mass graduated from the 
university of southern california in 1949 and the university of 
california los angeles in 1964

foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said 
monday the soviet legislature should oversee the defense industry 
and make decisions about how the armed forces are used abroad 
his remarks to a kremlin foreign policy conference reported by 
state television were an elaboration of proposals soviet officials 
have mentioned for expanding the powers of the legislature the 
supreme soviet 
shevardnadze said last months communist party conference set 
the stage for strengthening civilian control of the military 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev told the conference of 5000 
party members june 28 an effective constitutionally authorized 
mechanism was needed for a businesslike and competent 
discussion of international issues 
new legislative procedures would bring all departments 
occupied with the military and militaryindustrial activity 
under the control of the highest allpeoples elected organ said 
a television announcer who paraphrased shevardnadzes remarks the 
reference appeared to be to the supreme soviet 
supreme control over the military now is believed in the hands 
of the defense council which works in secret without revealing its 
exact functions or membership official media have said gorbachev 
leads the council 
gorbachev proposed in his speech to the party conference that a 
new stronger president take over the defense council and make key 
foreign policy decisions 
conference delegates supported his call for strengthening the 
legislature by creating a 2250member congress of peoples 
deputies that would choose a smaller standing supreme soviet 
shevardnadze said the new legislature should supervise use of 
military forces outside national borders of the country and plans 
for defense construction and openness of military budgets 
according to the television report 
bringing the legislature into decisionmaking on foreign 
military activities may be an attempt to avoid repetition of what 
some soviet officials say was the mistake of sending troops into 
afghanistan in december 1979 
they say only a few soviet leaders approved the intervention and 
did so without consulting specialists who would have advised 
against it the soldiers now are being withdrawn under an agreement 
mediated by the united nations 
a western military attache told the associated press the changes 
shevardnadze outlined reflect an effort to have more people have 
a say in military decisions 
shevardnadzes remarks were reported only partially in the 
television news program vremya a report of the foreign policy 
meeting by the tass news agency did not include shevardanadzes 
proposals for wider oversight of the military

attorney general edwin meese iii attacked two 
of his former top aides monday saying they triggered an 
independent counsels 14month criminal investigation of him by 
failing to conduct a competent and thorough inquiry in the 
spring of 1987 
meese told the national press club that if deputy attorney 
general arnold burns and criminal division chief william weld had 
done their jobs correctly there probably would have been no basis 
for independent counsel james mckay to investigate meese 
mckay recently concluded that meese probably broke criminal 
laws on four occasions but the independent counsel did not seek an 
indictment meese has since announced he will resign probably by 
midaugust and has pronounced himself completely vindicated 
weld and burns said they would have no immediate comment on 
meeses attack both are scheduled to testify before congress on 
tuesday 
meese said the decision to launch a criminal investigation of 
him was based on hearsay from executives of the scandalplagued 
wedtech corp and who had pleaded guilty to felony charges he said 
that neither he nor to the best of my knowledge his longtime 
friend e robert wallach who is under indictment for alleged 
racketeering in the wedtech scandal was interviewed during the 
inquiries overseen by burns and weld 
burns and weld abruptly resigned four months ago to protest 
meeses continued tenure as attorney general in the face of mckays 
investigation burns and weld are scheduled to testify about their 
resignations tuesday before the senate judiciary committee 
meese declared that the evidence now shows that if a competent 
and thorough preliminary investigation had been directed by the 
thendeputy attorney general and the former head of the criminal 
division there would likely have been no cause for referral to an 
independent counsel the attorney general did not refer to burns 
and weld by name 
in the spring of 1987 burns and weld oversaw initial inquiries 
by the justice departments public integrity section into meeses 
involvement with wedtech that resulted in an application to a 
federal court by burns with welds concurrence for mckay to 
launch a fullscale criminal investigation of meese on may 11 
1987 at the time meese asked for the probe as well 
federal law enforcement sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity say the integrity section found sufficient evidence to 
warrant further investigation of meese for possible violations of a 
law barring acceptance of gratuities they also said further 
investigation was merited on whether meese aided and abetted a 
possible violation of the conflictofinterest law by former white 
house aideturnedwedtech lobbyist lyn nofziger 
had investigators spoken to him or to wallach the hearsay 
from some criminals in new york would have been exposed for 
what it is and there would have been no need to even refer this 
to the independent counsel said meese 
after meeses speech justice department spokesman patrick 
korten acknowledged that an fbi agent had interviewed meese in 
april 1987 but said that was in response to the wedtech probe 
being conducted in new york by us attorney rudolph giuliani not 
in connection with the internal justice department review of 
meeses activities 
according to the sources wallach who is under indictment for 
alleged racketeering in the wedtech scandal also had been 
questioned extensively in the giuliani probe 
meese also questioned the motives of burns and weld for 
resigning burns told president reagan after quitting that meeses 
legal problems had caused a malaise in justice department 
morale 
meese disputed suggestions of low morale saying whether the 
sources of these falsehoods are the claims of partisan politicians 
on capitol hill or the selfserving statements of a few individuals 
who left the department for their own purposes an objective look 
will reveal that such characterizations could not be farther from 
the truth 
meese also said that in regard to mckays investigation never 
before has any independent counsel proceeding resulted in such a 
series of leaks to the news media 
to be the subject of a relentless series of articles based on 
leaks which often turned out to be false or misleading and to be 
severely restricted in my ability to respond generates a feeling 
of helplessness and frustration that is almost beyond 
description said meese

more than a year after it began the 
courtmartial of the first member of the military to face 
prosecution on aidsrelated charges moves to its trial phase 
tuesday 
pvt adrian g morris jr 28 of caseyville ill is accused 
of having threatened the health of three soldiers by failing to use 
condoms during sexual relations and by failing to warn them he had 
tested positive for exposure to the aids virus 
morris has pleaded innocent to three counts of aggravated 
assault three counts of conduct bringing discredit upon the army 
and one count of sodomy he has chosen to stand trial at fort 
huachuca in southern arizona before a sole military judge rather 
than in front of a jury panel 
morris could be sentenced to up to 17 years in prison 
dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of all pay and allowances if 
convicted 
he allegedly had sexual relations with one male and two female 
soldiers one of the women his fiancee at the time spec 4 
patricia c pruitt gave birth last year to a child allegedly 
fathered by morris 
a hearing had been scheduled monday on one remaining pretrial 
motion but the judge col raymond d cole decided instead to 
hold that hearing tuesday before the trial starts that motion 
involves a prosecution effort to have cole reverse himself on a 
ruling in may that would require one of morris alleged victims 
known only as jane doe to identify herself publicly when she 
testifies 
shes requested anonymity and we feel a certain obligation to 
do everything we can to protect her col harry beans staff 
judge advocate at fort huachuca said monday she came forward 
and we feel uncomfortable about the prospects of having to reveal 
her identity publicly since we dont feel it will add anything to 
the case 
courtmartial proceedings began more than a year ago but were 
adjourned indefinitely aug 5 to allow appeal of a ruling that 
prohibited the army from using morris aids blood test results 
according to the armys charges morris was routinely tested for 
aids in april 1986 after he reported to duty as a clerk at fort 
huachuca and was told that the results were positive for exposure 
to the hiv virus 
a midlevel military appellate court reversed cole last fall and 
in march the united states court of military appeals the highest 
military court let that ruling stand 
this spring morris was demoted from private first class 
reportedly for use of marijuana although officials have refused to 
disclose the reason for the demotion 
also in the spring sources said morris offered through his 
lawyers to accept an administrative severance from the army with a 
general discharge under honorable conditions the army refused 
since courtmartial proceedings began against morris several 
other military members have been charged have entered pleas or 
have been convicted of aidsrelated charges 
they include a soldier at fort hood texas who pleaded guilty 
to charges including disobeying an officer another at fort sill 
okla who pleaded guilty to aggravated assault an airman at 
wrightpatterson air force base ohio who was convicted of 
aggravated assault and a navy officer acquitted of assault and 
adultery in a san francisco case 
the army and air force have instituted regulations ordering 
commanding officers to inform any soldier or airman testing 
positive for exposure to the aids virus that failure to inform all 
sex partners of the test results and to practice safe sex will 
bring discharge or prosecution 
the navy instituted a similar legal advisory policy but it 
apparently does not require commanding officers to issue a warning 
according to a spokesman

instructors charged with involuntary manslaughter in the training 
death of a 19yearold recruit pleaded innocent monday 
a military judge also set an aug 29 trial date in the 
courtmartial of petty officer 2nd class michael combe but said he 
may delay it if a defense lawyer could not appear because of his 
wifes illness 
if the date stands combes trial would start a week after that 
of lt thomas a torchia officer in charge of the navy rescue 
swimmer school at pensacola naval air station when lee mirecki of 
appleton wis died march 2 
four other enlisted instructors were charged only with 
conspiracy to commit battery and received nonjudicial punishments 
including reductions in rank and loss of pay 
torchia also was offered nonjudicial punishment but chose a 
courtmartial in an effort to clear himself combe however 
received no choice his courtmartial was ordered by vice adm nr 
thunman chief of naval education an training following an 
investigative hearing last month 
the navy has accused combe of holding mireckis head under water 
after he was pushed into the pool besides manslaughter combe is 
charged with battery and conspiracy to commit battery 
instructors allegedly forced mirecki into a pool after he had 
panicked climbed out held on to an equipment rack and shouted 
that he was quitting the course

mirecki had a phobia about being dragged under water which 
triggered heart failure followed by drowning mirecki was taking 
part in a practice rescue in which the instructors playing the 
role of panicked air crash victims grasped recruits in a headhold 
witnesses at the hearing gave conflicting testimony on whether 
mirecki was in combes grasp or had extricated himself from the 
instructors headhold when he collapsed

bitter words circulated in the scientific 
community monday over reports that this weeks edition of a 
respected science journal will debunk an experiment that defies 
scientific theory 
the experiment baffled researchers because it appeared to use 
sound methods to prove the impossible that natural proteins called 
antibodies that react with certain blood cells will continue to 
react when diluted far beyond the point where they should 
theoretically be able to do so 
nature a science weekly published the antibody findings in its 
june 30 edition but in an unusual editorial reservation 
declared there is no physical basis for such an activity 
it said experts it later chose to review the research did not 
believe the result but could not fault the conduct of the 
experiments and the journal promised to have independent 
investigators observe repetitions of the experiments 
the report of the investigation is to appear in this weeks 
edition of nature and advance word leaked to the french press is 
that it dismisses the experiment as fanciful poorly conducted and 
of no scientific value 
editors of nature have refused comment but sources at the 
magazine confirmed privately that an article will appear that 
discredits the experiment 
they also confirmed reports that natures independent 
investigators were james randi a professional magician from 
florida known for studying unusual scientific claims and walter 
stewart of the national institutes of health at bethesda md an 
investigator of scientific fraud 
nature is going to produce a totally and completely negative 
report on the experiment said dr jacques benveniste of the 
french medical institute inserm who produced the inexplicable 
results at his paris laboratory 
researchers in canada israel and italy say they have duplicated 
benvenistes results benveniste and the sources at nature magazine 
both said the report does not suggest cheating was involved 
benveniste said in a telephone interview he had seen natures 
article and i dont consider it as serious i think it will harm 
nature 
randi and stewart made an enormous amount of mistakes that i 
will outline in my answer to nature benveniste said adding that 
the controls the investigators used were inadequate controls are 
special samples used in laboratories to check testing procedures 
quoting from the rebuttal he is sending to nature beneviste 
said all in all the judgment is based on one dilution series 
tested on two bloods in awful technical and psychological 
conditions outrageous 
he would not specify what natures article says because the 
magazine has not yet released it publicly but quoted a passage he 
said would make their whole report autodestruct 
as quoted by beneviste the passage says thus we believe that 
many of the experiments whose results are regarded as significant 
are artifacts of statistical noise but plainly this doesnt apply 
to all the data for example the fourth experiment in the series 
that means the investigators had failed to discredit all the 
experiments he said 
patricia fortner an immunology research associate at the 
university of toronto which reported duplicating the experiment 
said last month its unbelievable and it breaks all rules 
she said in an interview at the time that the supposedly 
impossible reaction occurs even at extreme levels of dilution when 
theoretically no antibody molecules are left in the solution 
this has really shaken up our world she said even people 
who have seen this phenomenon find it hard to believe

guerrillas attacked and set 
fire to a bowling alley in the capital monday in response to the 
police disruption of an antigovernment march the establishments 
manager said 
no one was reported hurt no group made independent claims of 
responsibility for the attack 
guillermo castro manager of the bolerama jardin said 10 to 12 
masked men with pistols and at least one submachine gun burst into 
the bowling alley and identified themselves as urban commandos 
of the farabundo marti national liberation front 
the front a coalition of five guerrilla groups has waged an 
8yearold war against the usbacked government but the fighting 
in recent years has been largely restricted to the countryside 
castro said the guerrillas made the about 30 patrons lie face 
down on the floor and took from them money they said was a 
contribution to the cause they said the attack was in reprisal 
for the governments repression of thursdays march 
the guerrillas then doused several pool tables in a room 
adjoining the main bowling area with gasoline and set them afire 
and the flames spread castro said 
firefighters arrived within 15 minutes and extinguished the 
blaze castro estimated damage at 20000 
castro said none of the bowling alley owners has any connection 
with the government and that he did not understand why the 
establishment was selected as a target 
last thursday police used tear gas and fired shots in the air 
to break up an antigovernment demonstration in san salvador 
protesters then burned at least nine vehicles 
human rights groups estimate more than 65000 people have been 
killed in el salvador since the civil war began in october 1979

michael dukakis was greeted by cheering massachusetts state 
employees monday when he returned to the governors office for the 
first time since winning the democratic presidential nomination 
but a republican complaint was likely to force him to wait for 46 
million in federal campaign funds 
this will probably add some time to the deliberative 
process sharon snyder a federal election commission spokeswoman 
said of a gop request that federal money be held up until the fec 
can rule on questions raised by texas sen lloyd bentsens pursuit 
of the vice presidency and reelection to the senate at the same 
time 
vice president george bush like dukakis was off the campaign 
trail after winding up a trip sunday night bush was polishing a 
speech in which he planned to call for tougher ethical standards 
for government officials and members of congress 
as for bentsens races jann olsten executive director of the 
republican senate campaign committee said monday there is no 
question that one is going to impact the other 
a dollar spent by sen bentsen in texas whether for the 
senate or the vice presidential campaign is going to directly and 
immediately benefit both said olsten it just isnt fair 
an unusual texas law permits bentsen to run for vice president 
at the same time he is on the ballot for reelection to the senate 
bentsens latest campaign report showed him with 39 million on 
hand for his senate race against gop challenger beau boulter 
while there is no lid on how much he can spend on his senate 
campaign federal law limits direct expenditures in the 
presidential campaign to the federal campaign funds divided 
equally between the major party candidates 
dukkais campaign spokesman leslie dach shrugged off the possible 
delay in receipt of the 46 million 
our campaign is moving full steam ahead with plenty of 
momentum from the convention he said 
one sign of the kind of momentum cheering the dukakis campaign 
was a new poll taken in texas by peter hart research associates 
the survey of 502 likely voters on friday and saturday the two 
days immediately following the democratic convention said dukakis 
was favored by 50 percent and bush by 40 percent the survey had a 
margin of error of 4 percent 
a preconvention survey in texas by hart had the two candidates 
tied at 46 percent each 
bush was spending the week in washington attending to official 
duties 
he will deliver a speech tuesday at the library of congress on 
ethics in government prescribing high standards to prevent 
conflict of interest by federal officials including members of 
congress aides say bush wants a strengthened office of ethics in 
the white house 
the speech long in the making was delayed until the release of 
the report by independent counsel james m mckay on attorney 
general edwin meese which said meese probably broke two tax laws 
and twice violated a criminal conflictofinterest statute mckay 
sought no charges 
bush says the justice department in particular must be above 
even the appearance of wrongdoing i would have to reluctantly 
conclude reluctantly because i like meese that those standards 
were not met bush told reporters last saturday 
when dukakis appeared at the massachusetts statehouse shortly 
before 9 am about 20 state employees greeted him with applause 
once in his office dukakis took up where he left off before the 
convention and became immersed in efforts to defuse legislative 
protests over his use of a lineitem veto to bring the state budget 
into balance 
some legislators were calling for a special session to try to 
override some of his vetoes of 138 million in appropriations 
meanwhile at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
that it is likely president reagan will veto plantclosing 
legislation that dukakis has been making an issue in the 
presidential campaign 
its always open until its done said the spokesman when 
asked if there were a chance reagan would change his position on 
the legislation that would require companies to give employees and 
communities 60 days notice before shutting down a plant

in a july 5 story about a motion to reduce 
the prison sentences of brothers barry and ronald semler the 
associated press erroneously reported that the men were convicted 
of illegally selling helicopters to north korea 
the semlers initially were charged with 27 counts of export 
violations including illegal sale of helicopters to north korea 
but in a pleabargaining agreement the semlers pleaded guilty to 
reduced charges the charge relating to alleged illegal helicopter 
sales was dropped 
in addition the article erroneously said a federal judge denied 
the motion to reduce the semlers prison sentences 
in fact the judge postponed his decision until after the summer 
olympic games in seoul south korea if there are no serious 
incidents at the games he said he will consider reducing the 
sentences in exchange for community service involving establishment 
of a camp for underprivileged children at ronald semlers malibu 
ranch 
the associated press also reported the judge said he would 
never let these guys out of prison if serious incidents 
occurred at the olympics in fact the judge said he would not let 
them out early on my own prerogative the judge does not have 
authority in this case to extend the prison terms

afghanistan lodged a strongly worded 
protest with the un monday accusing pakistan and the united 
states of violating peace accords and pleading with the un 
secretarygeneral to end this license to kill 
afghanistan charged the two nations with fanning the flames of 
war and engaging in blind terrorism 
a unsponsored political agreement was signed april 14 in 
geneva providing for soviet troop withdrawal over nine months 
noninterference in afghan affairs and return of afghan refugees 
who have fled the civil war 
the accords were signed by afghanistan and by pakistan which 
acted as spokesman for the antimarxist afghan guerrillas and were 
guaranteed by the united states and the soviet union the 
guerrillas did not sign the accords 
foreign minister abdul wakil of afghanistan cited in his letter 
to secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar the new wave of 
ferocious and adventurist actions by extremists linked with the 
peshawarbased alliance of seven guerrilla groups who have 
created appalling tragedies with missile barrages on kabul and 
other cities 
major afghan antigovernment guerrillas are based in peshawar 
pakistan kabul is the afghan capital 
wakil urged the un chief to end the purported violations of 
the afghan accords by pakistan and the united states which has 
been aiding the guerrillas 
the people of afghanistan expect that the means of 
interference and the shipment of weapons will stop and the license 
to kill shall no more be issued said the letter the latest in a 
series of un protests by afghanistan and the soviet union 
is it not high time for pakistan principal signatory of the 
accords and the united states of america the state guarantor 
which still fan the flames of war to understand the futility of 
blind terrorism wakils letter said 
his letter complained that on july 15 17 19 and 20 kabul 
residents were killed in bomb blasts by guerrillas based in 
pakistan in the past 1 months it said 177 missiles were fired 
into kabul killing 75 people and injuring 98 
the letter said the guerrillas want to disrupt the government 
policy of reconciliation create panic among the civilian 
population frighten refugees from returning to afghanistan and 
jeopardize the future of peace 
it said afghanistan is carrying out the geneva accords and 
soviet troops are withdrawing on schedule but brazen violations 
are being carried out by the other side 
the united states has been supplying the guerrillas with an 
estimated 500 million annually in arms and military supplies 
channeled through pakistan it vowed to continue the supplies as 
long as moscow keeps up its military support of the afghan 
government 
the afghan accords prohibit pakistans interference in 
afghanistans affairs but weapons supply from the soviet union is 
not banned a separate agreement signed by moscow and washington 
allows them to continue supplying their respective sides 
soviet troops entered afghanistan at the end of 1979 to prop up 
the prosoviet government and stayed on to help fight the 
guerrillas the estimated 115000 soviet troops began withdrawing 
may 15 and are to complete the pullout by feb 15

microscopic defects in the bodys 
energygenerating system have been shown to cause blindness and 
might also cause major diseases of the heart brain liver and 
kidneys a researcher said monday 
douglas c wallace of the emory university medical school in 
atlanta said his research is the first to link a specific disease 
to defects in tiny chemical factories called mitochondria which 
convert food into energy to support living cells 
wallace has for years been pursuing the notion that defects in 
mitochondrial genes could be important in many human diseases and 
now he says he has proved his case 
in a research paper that has been submitted to a journal for 
publication wallace said he demonstrates a link between a precise 
pinpoint mitochondrial defect and a rare inherited disease known as 
lhon which can lead to blindness 
i feel now statistically this is the right answer wallace 
said at the jackson laboratory in bar harbor where he is helping 
to teach a course in genetics 
dr berkeley powell associate professor at the oregon health 
sciences university in portland who is familiar with wallaces 
research said i think it is an important step but people have 
been suspecting this for a long time so i dont think its 
revolutionary 
the work is certainly very good and demonstrates it the link 
very nicely powell said 
the disease called lebers hereditary optic neuropathy or lhon 
is very rare wallace said but he has also linked mitochondrial 
defects to several other rare genetic diseases and he is convinced 
that these defects will be shown to be the cause of some major 
degenerative diseases for which the cause has not yet been found 
mitochondria are tiny structures inside cells that convert 
carbohydrates into energycarrying molecules that can be dispatched 
around the cell to keep its machinery running and keep it alive 
each mitochondrion has a tiny set of 13 known genes that are 
entirely separate from the genes and chromosomes that carry most 
hereditary information and that are responsible for most 
hereditary diseases 
the mitochondrial genes are passed on to offspring only by 
mothers through their eggs sperm carry only a few mitochondria 
and those mitochondria are not incorporated into the developing 
offspring 
furthermore they reproduce and mutate rapidly compared with 
other genes and thus the diseases they cause can appear and 
disappear in individuals and in succeeding generations wallace 
said thats why it was so difficult to prove that they were 
causing disease 
wallace said that cyanide is known to poison people by damaging 
their mitochondrial genes cyanide causes disorders of the brain 
heart liver kidneys and muscle he said 
it may therefore be possible that genetic defects in the 
mitochondria can also cause such disorders he said 
in particular he mentioned cardiomyopathy a gradual weakening 
of the heart muscle for which there is no cure except for a heart 
transplant its cause is unknown 
because mitochondria reproduce and mutate rapidly it is 
possible that defects that appear during an individuals lifetime 
can trigger this harmful degeneration in the heart he said 
wallace emphasized that with the exception of the few rare 
disorders to which he has linked the mitochondria his ideas about 
the role of mitochondria in disease are speculation

the senate on monday thwarted two attempts by 
sen jesse helms to eliminate or restrict the federal family 
planning program denounced by the north carolina republican as 
evidence of the government going out of control 
the senate voted 6521 to kill a helms amendment that would have 
deleted the 140 million title x family planning program from a 
spending bill for the departments of labor health and human 
services and education 
the chamber voted 5434 to kill another helms amendment that 
would have barred all spending by hhs unless the secretary required 
by jan 31 that unmarried dependent minors 17 or under have written 
parental consent to get contraceptives or prescriptions for 
contraceptives from federally funded clinics 
the senate also approved by voice vote a conscience clause 
saying none of the money in the bill can be used to require any 
person or entity to perform or facilitate abortions the provision 
applies to medical personnel or denominational hospitals with 
religious or moral objections to abortion 
the amendments arose during consideration of the 137 billion 
appropriations bill for the three departments the money is for 
fiscal 1989 which begins oct 1 
title x provides money to states local health departments and 
private groups for family planning clinics serving primarily 
lowincome women 
helms alleged that planned parenthood a major recipient of 
title x money is using federal funds for abortionrelated services 
and that in the last 10 years title x money has been used for 
secret sex programs for our nations teenagers 
the federal government takes money from american parents and 
then uses that money to give contraceptives to their 
children helms said this is wrong this is immoral this is 
evidence of the federal government going out of control and moving 
far beyond what our founding fathers had in mind 
title x is not an abortion program its a knowledge 
program rejoined sen lowell weicker rconn i wish it were 
that all teenagers would go to their parents for advice in this 
area but the fact is they dont there are those situations 
where there is no home then who does the job 
sen james exon dneb said lawmakers like himself who oppose 
abortion should not handicap family planning clinics in any way 
wed be taking a step backwards in the wrong direction by 
requiring parental consent he said we would have more and more 
unwanted and unplanned babies 
exon and sen lawton chiles dfla chairman of the laborhhs 
appropriations subcommittee urged senators to vote their 
convictions on the helms amendments and not cave in to political 
pressure 
we all know in our heart of hearts how we ought to stand on 
it chiles said of the parental consent amendment its a 
question of how we are recorded on it are you going to trigger 
some group against you or not 
the abortion amendment was sponsored by sen gordon humphrey 
rnh who said socalled conscience clauses currently are written 
into some laws but not others 
absent this amendment persons involved with programs in this 
bill might or might not be protected in the exercise of their 
conscience in this matter humphrey said in some cases they 
would in other cases they would not

king fahd said monday that he 
regretted the absence of iranians at the annual moslem pilgrimage 
to mecca and expressed hope of an amicable settlement of the rift 
between his country and iran 
fahd speaking to leaders of moslem delegations in a speech 
broadcast on saudi radio said i regret not having seen the 
pilgrims of the iranian nation participating with their moslem 
brothers at these sacred spots 
the saudi king said iranian pilgrims still were welcomed to 
the land of islam and blamed iran for decisions that led to 
their absence this year 
what we hope is that these matters be settled in an amicable 
manner and that the moslems be gathered together in one frame he 
added 
saudi official figures released monday said 1379556 moslems 
including 762755 from abroad and 616801 from within the kingdom 
gathered this year for the pilgrimage or hajj which culminated 
sunday with the start of the fourday eid aladha or feast of 
sacrifice 
about 145000 pilgrims from iran went to mecca for the 1987 hajj 
iranian pilgrims held demonstrations last year in mecca despite 
a ban on political protests and 402 people died including 275 
iranians saudi arabia said they died in a stampede but iran 
accused saudi police of shooting at the pilgrims 
citing terrorism and subversion saudi arabia last april broke 
diplomatic relations with iran which has advocated taking away 
from the saudi royal family custodianship of mecca and medina 
islams holiest sites 
saudi authorities earlier announced that the number of pilgrims 
would be restricted this year to one for every 1000 residents of 
each moslem country 
iran boycotted the hajj to protest the cuts and its 
governmentcontrolled news media said demonstrations occurred again 
this year the saudis have denied those reports 
fahd made no reference to the iranian reports of protests and 
referred only indirectly to the 1987 riots 
what happened last year he said was over and thanks be 
to god wisdom and logic prevailed and matters were put in their 
perspective he said 
all of the worlds 850 million moslems are expected to make at 
least one pilgrimage to mecca if they can afford it 
mecca is the birthplace of mohammed the founder of islam its 
grand mosque houses the kaaba islams holiest shrine 
pilgrims also made journeys this week to shrines in medina 
mohammeds base for his 7th century conquest of arabia and the 
spread of the religion

the kruegers of michigan having 
paddled their own canoes through arctic ice and past amazon 
alligators pushed off monday on the homestretch of their 
21000mile journey to the tip of south america 
verlen krueger 66 and his wife valerie 37 began their 
twocontinent canoe expedition on june 8 1986 about 200 miles 
north of the arctic circle and hope to finish in february at punta 
arenas chile 
ive always had this in me wanting to be an explorer like 
christopher columbus or daniel boone said verlen krueger a 
former farmer and plumber who built the two 17foot canoes in his 
garage at lansing 
michigan is paying some expenses of the 2year trip as part of 
the celebration of its 150th birthday the kruegers agreed to 
collect rain and river water for research by two chemical 
companies and another company provided freezedried food 
the two have paddled the icy waters of canadas mackenzie river 
and through the great lakes ridden the currents of the maumee 
wabash and tennessee rivers and coasted down the tom bigbee 
waterway into the gulf of mexico at mobile ala 
there were no precedents for us at all said krueger who 
has covered much of the united states on canoe trips 
he and his wife rigged their two canoes into a catamaran and 
paddled 2300 miles across the caribbean islandhopping from the 
bahamas to the dominican republic puerto rico and the west indies 
they entered south america in venezuelas orinoco river 
in the bahamas the canoes were surrounded by 3footlong 
iguanas fiercelooking but harmless 
alligators and howler monkeys abounded in the amazon we saw 
hundreds of alligators verlen said they have a disconcerting 
way of entering the water to get away and it looks like they are 
coming right at you 
the kruegers said they do not speak spanish but managed to get 
along by using a dictionary hand signals and smiling a lot 
one high navy official in venezuela issued an order that if 
anyone should see us they should take care of us and feed us 
said valerie krueger a former technical assistant to a geologist 
our secret is that with a woman and a man with a gray beard 
nobody feels threatened by us she said as for illnesses we 
dont have time to get sick she said and added the only 
thing that really became a problem other than our sanity and legs 
was that our soap bars kept falling overboard 
during a brief portage in brazil between the orinoco and an 
amazon tributary an army captain was so impressed by the voyage 
that he played them a tune on an instrument resembling a ukelele 
they had to paddle 200 miles upstream on the paraguay river in 
brazil because high winds had blown water plants into a solid mass 
that blocked their path and later spent 17 days without touching 
shore on the same river because of floods 
from the arctic circle to asuncion they logged more than 17000 
miles leaving about 4000 miles to go around cape horn to punta 
arenas it was sunny but chilly on monday when about 100 
wellwishers saw them off 
their planned route is down the paraguay south on the parana to 
buenos aires then down argentinas atlantic coast to the straits 
of magellan and around the cape to punta arenas

foreign minister shimon peres told conservative 
jews on monday he feels control of the faith by orthodox rabbis 
would harm jewish unity 
in an emotional speech frequently interrupted by applause peres 
told representatives of the usbased rabbinical assembly that his 
labor party has decided to keep jewish life together as a matter 
of principle 
we have decided profoundly seriously and permanently not to 
discriminate jewish people within the jewish life and not to divide 
the jewish people he said 
the rabbinical assembly represents 1200 conservative jewish 
leaders worldwide it began a sixday 88th annual convention monday 
conservatives are struggling against what they contend is 
discrimination by orthodox rabbis who dominate israels state 
religious offices 
more than 100 rabbis demonstrated against alleged discrimination 
sunday outside the seat of the chief rabbinate which is israels 
highest state religious body and is controlled by orthodox jews 
peres pledged to defend conservative jews against orthodox 
attempts to pass a whos a jew law that would change the status 
of the nonorthodox 
who is a jew peres asked i can answer it very simply 
there is no jew who can exclude another jew from the jewish life 
his statements deviated from past labor party policy of cultivating 
religious parties as political allies 
israeli analysts recently suggested peres has abandoned hope of 
forming a coalition with religious parties after parliamentary 
elections in november 
labor faces a tough campaign against prime minister yitzhak 
shamirs rightwing likud bloc with religious parties leaning 
toward likud 
ismar schorsch chancellor of the jewish theological seminary of 
america in new york recalled a meeting with peres at which the 
foreign minister told us with gravity that the elections to come 
would be the most important in the 40year history of israel 
last week mr peres enlarged the nature of his campaign he 
entered the lions den schorsch said referring to the foreign 
ministers criticism of the orthodox establishment in a speech 
wednesday to 500 orthodox rabbis from 30 countries 
mr peres raised the issue of religious discrimination within 
that assembly schorsch said by that exercise of courage he 
enlarged the campaign to include the issue of pluralism and the 
termination of religious terrorism within the state of israel

debates over biblical accounts of the 
virgin birth of jesus christ and his resurrection have done more 
damage to the spread of christianity in the east than have 
nonchristians a pakistani bishop said monday 
the theological controversies in the west can strike a fatal 
blow to the spread of the gospel bashir jiwan bishop of 
hyderabad said he addressed other anglican bishops on the ninth 
day of the threeweek lambeth conference 
among those in the audience was englands bishop of durham david 
jenkins in 1984 jenkins aroused controversy by suggesting the 
virgin birth the resurrection and other miracles reported in the 
new testament were symbolic stories and did not actually happen 
the lambeth conference of 525 bishops representing the worlds 
70 million anglicans including members of the church of england 
and us episcopalians meets every 10 years 
jiwan said disbelief in the bodily resurrection of jesus 
christ and the claim that it was only a spiritual experience of 
resurrection in the minds of the disciples raises the question of 
the authority of the bible 
the bible is the divine source of revelation and the 
touchstone of christian doctrine 
he added it appeared moslems believe more of christianity than 
western christian theologians who have laid down their 
spiritual weapons 
jiwan and jenkins were among three speakers discussing 
evangelization and culture but their subjects were not linked 
jenkins said christian churches destroyed the credibility of the 
gospel by competing to recruit new members 
evangelization must be wideranging not mutually exclusive and 
confront social political and economic issues he said 
christians should consider how their social structures 
political policies and economic exploitations diminished them 
in gods image jenkins said 
bishop david gitari of kenya the first african bishop to 
address the full conference criticized church laws for allowing 
tolerance and pastoral care to divorcees while disciplining 
polygamists 
we see no contradiction in extending pastoral care to 
divorcees despite jesus strictures against divorce he said 
yet we maintain a rigid disciplinary stance againmst polygamy 
despite jesus silence on the subject

police stormed the hideout monday of a

agriculture department will allow horse shows for all breeds to 
continue said a senator who had monitored the developments 
the negotiations have been long and complex said sen mitch 
mcconnell rky but i think everyone has emerged a winner 
horse shows for many breeds were closed earlier this year after 
the american horse protection association filed a lawsuit seeking 
enforcement of regulations primarily for walking horses that had 
adversely affected much of the industry 
the regulations approved monday permanently replace interim 
rules that had been imposed to allow the continuation of horse 
shows while the regulations were being negotiated 
major provisions of the new regulations include a new uniform 
standard for pads that would apply to all horse breeds new rules 
on pad material rejection of a proposal by usda to further limit 
the weight of horseshoes and new guidelines on examination 
procedures for horses exhibited in walking horse shows 
the usda had solicited comments in april on the interim 
regulations during the last several months mcconnell sponsored 
negotiations with major horse organizations addressed by the usda 
interim rules 
the negotiations resulted in a joint comment on behalf of over 
100 national horses organizations being sent to agriculture 
secretary richard lyng in the letter the organizations 
recommended the new regulations adopted monday 
these recommendations were reached after weeks of negotiations 
with every major horse organization throughout the country 
mcconnell said in a statement released by his office now that 
the regulations are permanent horse shows throughout kentucky and 
the nation can continue without the fear of being shut down

louise joy brown the worlds first testtube 
baby celebrated her 10th birthday monday with her parents and 
sixyearold sister natalie also conceived through in vitro 
fertilization 
the birthday party was held at the family home in whitchurch a 
suburb of the seaport of bristol according to the daily mail 
newspaper 
it quoted louises mother lesley brown as saying one of the 
things we were most frightened of when she was born was that shed 
play on the fact that she was the first testtube baby but 
fortunately she seems pretty stable and levelheaded 
louises father john brown is a truck driver and the couple 
volunteered for in vitro fertilization after they had been unable 
to have children during nine years of marriage 
professor robert edwards who pioneered in vitro fertilization 
with the late gynecologist patrick steptoe said research in the 
past decade was making the technique of conception outside the womb 
more available and less expensive for childless couples 
in an interview on british broadcasting corp television 
edwards said 
the birth of louise brown was the first time that science and 
medicine had really come into human conception and clarified all 
the problems and all the mysteries of human conception 
now we have a lot of information success rates are going 
up with the use of frozen embryos together with better fertility 
drugs and the cost is going down because newer simpler 
techiques of collecting eggs are making the approach far more 
simple 
steptoe died earlier this year he and edwards a physiologist 
devised the technique originally to treat women with blocked 
fallopian tubes 
in vitro fertilization has helped produce thousands of babies 
worldwide but the technique remains costly and uncertain of 
success and is available to only about 5 percent of childless 
couples 
most people do not get pregnant with the technique 
edwards said

republican national convention organizers 
said monday it looks as if most of the requests for hotel rooms 
during next months gathering can be met although initially the 
demand was far greater than the supply 
monday was the deadline for state delegations and other groups 
which made their reservations through the gop to send their 
deposits to hotels by the days end it looked as if all those 
delegates staffers and journalists would have a place to call home 
during the gathering which begins aug 15 
weve been able to accomodate pretty much everyone said 
mary mead a convention spokeswoman 
earlier organizers had been swamped with requests in fact 
there were about 3000 more rooms asked for than there were rooms 
and that had organizers nervous 
but some delegations and news organizations apparently decided 
they didnt quite need as much space as they had originally sought 
its so hard to tell these things until it gets time for the 
deposits said mead mostly everything has evened out groups 
adjust their numbers mostly downward 
monday was a busy day for hoteliers trying to sort out the new 
numbers 
were matching names to deposit checks making sure the monies 
match up with the names said tom rosepink manager of the 
marriott hotel where allbutcertain republican nominee george 
bush and the delegations from texas new hampshire connecticut and 
maine will stay 
he said 1125 of his hotels 1290 rooms are assigned to the 
convention through the rnc virtually all of the remaining 175 
rooms including a bloc taken by cbs are for news organizations 
and other groups attending the convention he said 
the only exceptions are eight rooms rented yearround by delta 
air lines and even they are going to drop people off to attend 
the convention one day and then continue on their route to la 
he said 
rosepink said he had been asked for more rooms for the vice 
president and his entourage and would give bush any rooms assigned 
to the delegations but not ultimately used by them 
my gut feeling is that there may be one or two rooms 
available he said 
many hotels couldnt meet the demand without adding a wing or 
cleaning out a storeroom the hyatt which will be media central 
has booked every one of its 1193 rooms to the convention 
the pallas suites hotel which has 800 of its 1000 rooms set 
aside may be able to provide 30 to 50 more if renovations are 
completed in time said joan caldwell president and general 
manager of oak development corp which operates the hotel 
she said the remaining rooms are taken by permanent guests 
tours which made reservations before the gop decided to come to new 
orleans and the secret service which booked the rooms on its own 
rather than through the convention 
there are 25500 hotel rooms in and around new orleans 19500 
within city limits and 6000 in neighboring jefferson parish said 
bill langkopp of the greater new orleans hotelmotel association 
the republicans blocked 17500 anything else id think 
would be just a normal transient movement the businessman who 
comes here all the time langkopp said

a senior official of japans governing party 
apologized monday for remarks he made that implied that american 
blacks do not care if they go bankrupt 
michio watanabe chief of the liberal democratic partys policy 
affairs research council and considered a possible future prime 
minister said his remarks over the weekend were misleading and 
inadvertent 
in his speech saturday at the partys annual summer retreat 
watanabe said 
they americans use credit cards a lot they have no savings 
so they go bankrupt 
if japanese go bankrupt they would think it serious enough to 
escape into the night or commit family suicide but among those 
guys over there in the united states are a lot of blacks and so 
on who would think without concern were bankrupt now we dont 
have to pay anything back he said 
on monday watanabe issued a statement apologizing for his 
comments 
in speaking of us personal consumption on july 23 i made 
misleading and inadvertent remarks though in no sense did i ever 
imply any racial discrimination he said in the statement 
i very much regret that the remarks may have hurt the feelings 
of american friends and withdraw those words with apologies he 
said 
watanabe a former cabinet minister who held the finance and 
trade portfolios is a powerful political figure known to aspire to 
be japans premier 
in february he drew fire from china when he said in a campaign 
speech that people in chinas shanxi province have dug themselves 
into pits and are still living there he later apologized for the 
statement 
watanabes comments were the latest in a series of controversial 
statements by japanese politicians that have offended foreign 
countries 
two years ago former premier yasuhiro nakasone told a liberal 
democratic party meeting that the large number of blacks puerto 
ricans and mexicans in the united states brought down americas 
intelligence level 
that comment prompted widespread criticism of nakasone in the 
united states and he issued an apology

grinage was wanted for the hijacking of an eastern airlines dc8 
plane en route from new yorks kennedy airport to miami on jan 2 
1969 
authorities said grinage and her thenhusband tyrone ellington 
austin took a 2yearold boy hostage on the flight and forced the

of eight 
during the alleged hijacking authorities said austin ran up 
the aisle of the plane shouting black power and havana 
barbara cottrell an assistant us attorney declined comment 
monday when asked if grinage was involved with any terrorist 
organizations 
authorities received an anonymous tip last year that grinage was 
in albany but held off arresting her until monday because they 
needed more time to firmly establish her identity cottrell said 
the couple remained in havana when the passengers and crew 
returned to the united states and were indicted on air piracy 
charges later that year 
austin died in 1971 from wounds he received during a shootout 
with new york city police while fleeing a bank robbery authorities

requested the time to get a more experienced attorney she was to 
be jailed overnight 
grinage had no comment to reporters monday 
she is unable to respond in her present state to questions 
addressed to her eytina told acting us magistrate joseph 
scully describing his wife as distraught 
if convicted on an air piracy charge she could be jailed for 20 
years to life 
grinage has lived in the albany area since 1983 and has had at 
least six different addresses said cottrell 
speaking to scully eytina said his wife had lived in the 
community for 10 years and was gainfully employed but cottrell 
said grinage who has five children did not have a job outside the 
home 
the fbi has 14 aliases listed for grinage according to an 
affadavit filed in support of a search warrant authorities have 
further established her identity through samples of her writing and 
telephone records of a phone call made to her grandfather the rev

the brain tumor removed from a 2yearold 
ukrainian girl is cancerous and her prognosis is guarded doctors 
said monday 
hanna andrievna sverstiuk had the tumor removed from the base of 
her brain stem last friday at childrens hospital of philadelphia 
the outlook for her future is guarded depending on her 
response to therapy said dr roger j packer while theres a 
high likelihood of the tumor recurring were hoping this new form 
of treatment can keep her in remission 
hannas mother maria sverstiuk has said she believes the 
walnutsized tumor resulted from radiation from the chernobyl 
nuclear disaster 50 miles from kiev in the soviet union 
hanna was born in kiev five days after the april 26 1986 
explosion and fire that killed at least 31 people and released a 
cloud of radioactive material she was diagnosed as having a brain 
tumor two months ago 
doctors however say a solid tumor like hannas would have 
taken 10 to 20 years to develop if it were caused by radiation 
she is recovering extremely well considering the type of 
brain surgery she had packer said 
her mother has maintained a bedside vigil reading stories and 
singing ukrainian songs according to the hospital hanna is to 
begin her radiation program and physical therapy later this week 
the hospital said 
the toddlers trip to the united states followed efforts of 
ukrainian communities on both sides of the atlantic and 
negotiations between washington and moscow

dorene raterman said dr larry lewman state medical examiner in 
portland

to a court appearance and a judge held the others arraignment 
secretly because he feared for the suspects safety

a nearby hotel had driven to the beach that night in eastmans car 
to drink beer and talk and saw the girl there according to a

a judge monday ordered the san diego yacht club 
to accept the challenge of a new zealand club and settle the battle 
for the americas cup sailing trophy on the seas instead of in the 
courts 
the ruling also cleared the way for the san diego club to use 
its controversial twohulled catamaran in defense of the title it 
reclaimed for the united states in 1987 
state trial court justice carmen b ciparick ordered the two 
clubs to begin racing sept 19 off the coast of san diego 
she also denied the request of an english yacht club to join the 
race and rejected the new zealanders petition to hold the san 
diego club in contempt of court 
the vision that the donors sought to perpetuate over the 
years was that of an international race on a grand scale among 
boats on the seas and not a landbound battle among clever lawyers 
in the courthouse ciparick said 
the mercury bay boating club of auckland new zealand had asked 
the san diego club to accept its challenge sooner than 1991 the 
next date under the traditional formula of racing every four years 
mercury bay also asked to use boats about 90 feet at the water line 
instead of the customary 45 feet 
the judge did not specifically rule on whether san diego could 
use its catamaran but ordered both sides to proceed with the 
competition and bring any complaints to court when the race was 
over 
the cup has always involved sailing challenges between similar 
boats but the judge has ordered us to sail and we are ready to 
sail mismatch or not said mercury bays peter debreceny 
debrency reached in san diego if its a mismatch it will 
destroy the future of the americas cup 
tom mitchell a spokesman for the sail america group which is 
sponsoring the san diego entry called the decision a victory for 
the american defenders and said his group is ready to race 
lets get the boats in the water and sail mitchell said 
according to the judge the americas cup 1887 deed of gift 
which established the rules for the sailing competition is not 
specific about many of the changes in yacht racing since the first 
americas cup in 1851 
the new york yacht club held the cup for more than 125 years 
until it lost in 1983 at newport ri to the royal perth yacht 
club of australia 
stars amp stripes the san diego yacht clubs entry recaptured 
it last year when it beat new zealand in the semifinals then beat 
the austrlian yacht kookaburra iii in perth australia

a member of ronald reagans 1980 campaign staff 
asked the palestine liberation organization to help stall the 
release of 52 americans held hostage by iran until after the 
november election a plo official claims the white house quickly 
denied the allegation 
we were told that if the hostages were held the plo would be 
given recognition and the white house door would be open for 
us said bassam abu sharif identified as chief adviser to plo 
chairman yasser arafat in an interview published in the september 
issue of chicagobased playboy magazine 
it is not true white house spokesman roman popadiuk said 
monday in a telephone interview from washington popadiuk declined 
to comment further 
arafat who was also interviewed by the magazine did not 
mention the alleged contact with the reagan staff member but did 
say that the plo had been instrumental in winning the release of 
some hostages 
we released the first hostages from the embassy arafat 
said they were released according to my personal efforts 
arafat said he undertook the mission at the request of reagans 
predecessor and 1980 campaign opponent president jimmy carter 
there was a special and permanent contact between me and 
president carter arafat said i have written documents from 
president carter himself 
sharif said he met in beirut with one of reagans closest 
friends during the 1980 presidential race he identified the 
supporter as a major financial contributor to the campaign and a 
member of the campaign staff but did not name the person 
we have the proof if it is denied sharif told playboy 
and i personally assure you that if the reagan administration 
denies what i have said we will turn this evidence over to you 
sharif said the reagan associate asked that i contact the 
chairman and make the request he said he was told they would 
deny it if it ever became public 
minutes after reagans inauguration on jan 20 1981 marked the 
end of the carter administration the 52 americans who had been 
held hostage in tehran for 444 days were flown to freedom 
a spokeswoman for former president jimmy carter said that he was 
not available for comment but that he had been asked previously 
about reports that a reagan supporter had attempted to delay the 
hostages release 
we have reports similar but i never sought or received any 
confirmation of the allegations spokeswoman melissa montgomery 
quoted carter as saying 
sharif who also serves as arafats interpreter made the 
assertions during interviews of arafat conducted by a playboy 
writer in tunis tunisia and baghdad iraq in april and may said 
playboy spokesman bill paige 
neither arafat nor sharif were paid for the interview paige 
said 
he said he did not know if arafat was present when sharif made 
the allegation about a reagan ally

the nation is finally starting to consecrate a 
forgotten war which stirred neither patriotic fervor nor domestic 
protest the brutal anticommunist crusade in korea which killed 
54000 americans and ended with an uneasy armistice 35 years ago 
wednesday 
world war ii veterans returned home triumphantly to tickertape 
parades returning vietnam veterans often met hostility many of 
the 15 million men and women who served in korea during the 37 
months of fighting simply came home for years images of their 
sacrifice have been summoned up only during broadcasts of mash the 
television comedy series 
they went in quietly and went out quietly says one of them 
retired army col john fc kenney jr they were welcomed back 
home with an attitude of indifference there were no parades but 
there were no putdowns either 
today only 40 percent of the us public is old enough to 
recall the korean war in korea today the united states still maintains 
one full division on the demarcation line 
but now perhaps inspired by the belated recognition given 
vietnam veterans the dead and living from korea are being honored 
with resolutions from congress and space on the capitals national 
mall for a multimilliondollar memorial 
this week korea vets are gathered in washington for a round of 
ceremonies which though mostly lowkey amount to the most 
extensive array of commemorative events since the fighting stopped 
in 1953 according to kenney 
the war began after the soviettrained north korean army crossed 
the 38th parallel into south korea on june 25 1950 it ended in 
stalemate on july 27 1953 
richard kolb writing in a recent edition of the veterans of 
foreign wars magazine points out that the war was not popular 
among americans and was the first in which america essentially 
declared the enemys homeland offlimits to us fighting forces 
kolb says that body counts became more important than real 
estate as north korean and chinese units staged humanwave assaults 
that accounted for many of the 14 million dead or wounded 
communist troops 
the war called a conflict and police action by the 
truman administration saw the first us use of helicopters to 
evacuate wounded according to kolb 
fighting under a united nations banner 54260 americans died in 
korea 33643 of them in battle in the nine years of vietnam 
58149 americans died 47396 in battle on a daytoday basis 
korea was far bloodier 
the pentagon says that 1269 americans are still listed as 
prisoners of war or missing in action from vietnam it has no 
specific numbers for gis still missing from the korean war but it 
numbers the pows at 389 
it wasnt until 1985 that korea vets even had their own 
organization founded by retired army 1st sgt bill norris of half 
moon ny the korean war veterans association has grown from 39 
charter members to more than 3000 and is a central participant in 
this weeks 35th anniversary ceremonies 
kenney now is working out of a sparsely furnished office at the 
interior department as executive director of the korean war 
veterans memorial advisory board which is spearheading the drive 
to build the memorial in washington 
he said the push for the memorial began after vietnam veterans 
began the offensive that culminated in the dedicated of their 
monument on the mall in 1982 the korea vets were saying 
wheres ours he said 
after several years of groundwork organizing and lobbying the 
korea vets won permission from congress and the interior department 
this year to erect a privately financed memorial on the mall the 
initial budget is 6 million with veterans required to repay any 
seed money advanced from the treasury 
the location is still undecided but the american battle 
monuments commission is recommending a site near the lincoln 
memorial and across a reflecting pool from the vietnam memorial 
once the location is chosen the board will hold a competition 
to select a design to reflect the boards concept that it must 
radiate a message that is at once inspirational in content and 
timeless in meaning unique in concept designed for public 
use 
kenney says that 22 million has been raised so far with 1 
million coming from hyundai motor america the us subsidiary of 
the korean automaker and nearly 300000 coming from hyundai 
dealers 
among some 3500 contributors the disabled american veterans 
have given 500000 the vfw 250000 and the paralyzed veterans of 
america 100000 according to kenney whose goal is to put up a 
good memorial on what i call everybodys front lawn 
kenney says that a korean war memorial is needed because in 
the long run the nation owes some form of recognition to those 
who without all the fanfare of a war to save the world marched 
off quietly to fight for freedom for a people they never heard of 
because their country asked them to do so

deposed haitian president leslie 
manigat said monday that haitian military men who are known friends 
of the united states were involved in the coup that ended his 
nations 4month experiment in democracy 
he told a news conference his policies were poorly understood by 
washington and the nationalist and progressive orientation of 
his government was misinterpreted as a result the united states 
stood by as the coup proceeded manigat said 
manigat came to caracas on friday from his exile home in miami 
he is campaigning to gain world support for a democratic front of 
haitian politicians aimed at restoring democracy to haiti 
finally i can say that various officials involved in the coup 
are known and perceived as friends of the us manigat said 
he went on i was recently informed by a highlevel us 
official that in the cia and the pentagon there was a lot of 
confusion and doubt regarding the orientation of our government 
and that they were not convinced when we called it nationalist and 
progressive 
it seems like another error of my government was to want to 
remove the haitian police from the army and put the police 
under the justice ministry this was interpreted by some 
military officials and by those who see through their eyes as a 
weakening of the army 
manigat said that when he left haiti for the dominican republic 
following the may 19 military coup someone asked him if he had 
consulted with the united states before trying to remove lt col 
henri namphy who removed manigat instead 
dont you know that you cant change any army commander 
without first hearing the opinion of the us embassy the person 
said according to manigat 
manigat gave no details about the individual 
the desposed leader called for the worlds democracies to 
repudiate publicly namphys military regime 
manigat said he will seek venezuelas support in meetings with 
president jaime lusinchi and others before returning to miami on 
friday and will meet with other haitian politicians this weekend in 
miami 
manigat spent 197886 in exile in venezuela during the 
repressive duvalier era in haiti and developed close contacts with 
members of the social christian party 
namphy headed a threeman junta that took over the haitian 
government in february 1986 when dictator jeanclaude duvalier 
fled into exile manigat was elected last january in elections that 
many haitians claimed were rigged by the army 
manigat placed namphy under house arrest after overriding 
namphys orders for changes in the army soldiers loyal to namphy 
freed him june 19 and namphy deposed manigat who was put on a 
plane to neighboring dominican republic the following day

secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
said monday night he is optimistic a truce date in the iraniraq 
war can be set within 10 days iraq said it would be out of all 
newly won iranian territory by tuesday 
the un chief spoke on the macneillehrer newshour tv 
program after saying earlier that he scheduled separate talks for 
wednesday with the foreign ministers of iran and iraq to pave the 
way for a unsupervised ceasefire in their 8yearold war 
the official tanjug news agency in belgrade reported monday that 
yugoslavia accepted a un call to contribute military officers to 
monitor such a truce tanjug said about 250 un truce observers 
from throughout the world will be sent to iran and iraq once a 
ceasefire was declared but gave no specifics 
foreign minister tariq aziz of iraq asked to meet this week to 
discuss a ceasefire troop withdrawal prisoner exchange and 
formal peace negotiations iraq had sought facetoface talks with 
iran 
perez de cuellar said monday he would not impose direct talks 
between iran and iraq but hoped both sides would agree to such 
negotiations later 
aziz was expected at un headquarters tuesday 
appearing on the same broadcast as perez de cuellar were the 
iraqi un ambassador ismat kittani the iranian envoy mohammad 
jaafar mahallati and the us ambassador to the united nations 
vernon walters 
kittani said that by monday midnight all iraqi forces will 
have completed their withdrawal to our side of the internationally 
recognized border we have no intention of occupying and 
holding iranian territory for bargaining 
mahallati said iran is ready to immediately observe a 
ceasefire and that he does not object to direct talks between 
iran and iraq 
he again charged that iraq used chemical weapons in its latest 
military offensive and kittani refused to deny it 
walters said he viewed kittanis announcement about withdrawing 
from iranian territory as a positive sign 
i think they iran and iraq both made a decision to go for 
peace the us envoy said eight yars is a long time you get 
weary 
walters said he was optimistic peace would result the iraniraq 
war began in september 1980 
im an old soldier i know what war involves i have seen the 
bodies being put into body bags and thats when you really know 
what war is about and there have been almost a million bodies put 
into body bags in the persian gulf war and that has an impact on 
nations walters said 
its their coming generation that theyre going to be losing 
and i think thats why they have both come to the conclusion that 
this is the time to stop 
iran has said peace efforts could be jeopardized by iraqs 
latest offensive intended to strengthen its position at the 
bargaining table 
irans foreign minister ali akbar velayati arrived in new york 
monday and the iranian mission said he would meet tuesday with the 
president of the security council paulo nogueirabatista of brazil 
perez de cuellar said last week that the iranians are not yet 
prepared to have direct talks so he would conduct shuttle 
diplomacy meeting each delegation separately as they go to his 
38thfloor office 
the new impetus to the peace process came july 18 when iran 
suddenly announced it would accept security council resolution 598 
which demands an immediate ceasefire in the persian gulf war iran 
had resisted for one year 
but iraq which accepted the resolution a year ago abruptly 
called for immediate facetoface talks in new york before a truce 
goes into effect 
un officials meanwhile warned that plans for un truce 
supervision could be jeopardized by the world bodys financial 
crisis largely caused by us arrears of 467 million twothirds 
of the total un debt the united states has been withholding its 
legal un contribution for years to compel the organization to 
institute reforms 
a un technical team of military experts was bound for tehran 
to start working out details of a truce it later will visit 
baghdad a separate team arrived in tehran to look into the 
prisoners of war situation and later will visit baghdad 
at the state department in washington monday spokesman charles 
redman reaffirmed us willingness to talk with iran but said he 
knew of no contacts planned with velayati 
the security council held closeddoor consultations monday on 
irans protest against iraqs latest alleged use of chemical 
weapons it adjourned without taking action

the offshore oil platform explosion that killed 
167 people will cost britain more than 500 million in lost energy 
sales the government announced monday 
in aberdeen scotland police said the body of one more worker 
had been pulled from the north sea on monday bringing the total 
bodies recovered to 42 
energy secretary cecil parkinson told parliament that the fiery 
blast that tore apart the piper alpha oil rig june 6 also knocked 
five related platforms out of production 
the shutdown of all six north sea platforms cut britains oil 
production 12 percent and natural gas production 1 percent 
parkinson said 
he said the five associated platforms could be back in service 
in a few months but britain was not producing 180000 barrels of 
oil per day as the rigs stood idle he estimated the cost in lost 
energy sales at 516 million 
piper alpha 120 miles off scotlands eastern coast produced 
120000 to 130000 barrels a day before it exploded in the worst 
disaster in oilfield history 
parkinson told the 650member house of commons that the 
government would accept any safety recommendations stemming from 
investigations into the tragedy 
the los angelesbased occidental petroleum corp which is the 
operator and main owner of the platform said four workers remain 
hospitalized the company said 125 men are still missing 
winds gusting to more that 40 mph monday prevented texas 
troubleshooter red adair and his oilfire experts from boarding the 
stricken platform 
they were still trying to tame two burning wellheads fires at 
two other wells are being controlled by injecting sea water to 
dampen the flames occidental said and three other wells have been 
plugged with cement

greek and american negotiators started 
another round of talks monday for a new us bases agreement just 
12 days after the socialist government announced it was ending the 
current accord 
government spokesman sotiris kostopoulos stressed that were 
not negotiating an extension of the existing agreement but a new 
one 
he also repeated premier andreas papandreous pledge that a new 
agreement must be approved by a referendum before it can take 
effect 
the current fiveyear agreement expires in december this year 
on july 13 greece formally notified the united states in writing 
that the 1983 pact was ending and that the bases should be 
dismantled by 1990 
western diplomats said the notification is considered a 
formality that will not affect this weeks talks 
negotiations have been slowed by athens insistence that a new 
accord should express support for greece in its dispute with turkey 
over the aegean region 
the american position is that an agreement on military bases 
should not be broadened to include political backing for greece 
papandreou and the governing panhellenic socialist movement came 
to power in 1981 on a platform that called for closure of the four 
main american bases and 20 smaller installations but later 
modified its positions 
the party indicated in a document published last week that the 
bases may be allowed to stay it said the party maintains a 
longterm goal of shutting down the bases but with a decisive 
contribution to our national defense a continuation of defense 
cooperation is possible 
greece receives 343 million yearly in us military credits as 
a form of rent for the bases 
about 3500 us servicemen are stationed in greece mostly at a 
us air force support base next to athens airport and at another 
air force facility on the island of crete

the communist government will open a 
limited stock exchange in budapest on jan 1 with members only 
permitted to buy and sell shares according to the head of the 
securities trade secretariat 
ilona hardy in an interview with the government daily magyar 
hirlap published monday said financial institutions that conduct 
weekly dealers days that were introduced earlier this year 
would discuss the establishment of a selfgoverning council and an 
ethics committee at a meeting tuesday 
establishment of a stock exchange even with a severe restriction 
on membership is a significant break from the anticapitalist 
economics followed by hungary and other eastern european nations 
following soviet domination at the end of world war ii 
hardy was quoted as saying the creation of a closed jointstock 
company could be followed by the transformation of other companies 
into jointstock firms with the stock exchange establishing their 
value 
the planned stock exchange is to open at the same time that a 
new law on companies goes into effect 
government officials have said the law now in the drafting 
stage will be presented to parliament in the fall it is to put 
state cooperative and private enterprise firms on an equal footing 
and limit state monopolies in some areas 
hardy said about half of the securities issued in the first six 
months of this year valued at the equivalent of 74 million have 
been sold on secondary markets 
according to the official mti news agency which carried 
excerpts of the interview hardy said the bond rate has dropped to 
between 90 and 93 percent leading issuers to offer bonuses worth 
between 1 and 3 percent in an effort to create a higher demand 
on july 1 interest rates on private deposits rose by an average 
4 percent making bonds issued last year with a fixed interest less 
attractive mti said

anniversary of the signing of the constitution that established 
puerto rico as a semiautonomous u commonwealth and the 90th 
anniversary of the us military occupation of puerto rico in 1898 
young girls laid flowers and puerto rican flags on the spot 
where carlos soto arrivi 18 and arnaldo dario rosado 24 were 
shot on july 25 1978 and speakers demanded that those responsible 
for the deaths be brought to justice

went up to a remote mountain called cerro maravilla marvel

blowing up a transmitter

assassinated by an underground group that said it was avenging the 
two deaths 
police first said they killed the two in an exchange of gunfire 
but a senate investigation later revealed that rosado and soto 
arrivi were shot at close range while on their knees after having 
surrendered 
six policemen are serving long prison sentences for murder in 
the killings and eight officers in all have been convicted of 
perjury for lying to two federal grand juries

the drought that has forced okefenokee 
swamps wildlife to gather near deeper pools and its alligators to 
engage in cannibalism is necessary for the survival of the swamp 
a parks official says 
the swamp has tolerated drought for thousands of years 
drought is a part of the biological process that creates open water 
areas and marsh areas said john schroer manager of the 
okefenokee national wildlife refuge 
swamp vegetation dries out during a drought increasing the 
chance of wildfire ignited by lightning but schroer said 
wildfires are necessary because they burn off floating islands of 
peat which eventually can turn into dry land indians dubbed the 
swamp the land of the trembling earth because of the undulating 
peat

attorney general edwin meese iii attacked two

failing to conduct a competent and thorough inquiry in the

meese told the national press club that if deputy attorney 
general arnold burns and criminal division chief william weld had 
done their jobs correctly there probably would have been no basis 
for independent counsel james mckay to investigate meese

indictment meese has since announced he will resign probably by

emilio ponce a combattempered 
colonel who is a frontrunner to be armed forces commander says 
the militarys chief aim in el salvadors civil war should be 
winning the loyalty of the rural poor not killing guerrillas 
he said in an interview at his 3rd brigade headquarters in this 
provincial capital 85 miles east of san salvador that soldiers 
should help improve living standards for the rural poor campesinos 
as they are called 
build a coop and set up a chickenraising enterprise teach 
them how to plant vegetables the raising of pigs he said 
these are cheap projects more immediate the people see problems 
resolved more quickly and it leaves them with a tool they can use 
for life 
ponce 41 the commander of the 3rd brigade added that he has 
set aside some of his troops for that purpose and indicated he 
believed similar efforts should be made all around the countryside 
by the military 
highranking military sources say he is the most likely officer 
to succeed gen adolfo blandon as chief of the joint chiefs of 
staff when blandon retires in the coming months 
ponce said he uses two kinds of military units in his command 
one is eminently operative for carrying out offensive 
military operations that principally strike guerrilla commanders 
at different levels these are units trained for night operations 
ambushes and longrange patrols the other type of unit carries out 
first a military role but then fulfills a political function he 
explained 
we cannot think that solely by military means we are going to 
resolve this war even if we kill all the subversives the problem 
will not end such deplorable socioeconomic conditions would 
remain that it the insurgency could easily revive 
this is an ideological and psychological war a war for the 
masses and a war of oganization 
of the political work he added you always have to give the 
campesinos something concrete because they cant eat words 
referring to two previous and unsuccessful development 
projects designed by us advisers to win over the populace he 
said its no longer a matter of building schools or paving 
roads what were doing requires less sophistication and less 
bureaucracy 
ponce said his strategy is producing positive results in his 
eastern command zone 
but two commanders of the guerrillas farabundo marti liberation 
front known as the fmln contended in interviews broadcast by the 
rebels clandestine radio venceremos that an army that represents 
el salvadors status quo can never win the poor farmers heart 
commander jorge melendez said the fact that rebel forces are 
still active in all of the countrys 14 provinces although 
outnumbered 81 by government troops means the army has failed 
militarily 
the root of this failure is in the nature of the fmln which 
arises precisely from those same popular sectors he said 
rebel commander francisco mena sandoval said in a separate 
interview in june the objectives in the mind of each combatant 
have to be expressions of the true interests of his people and 
thats why neither defense minister gen carlos vides casanova 
nor the americans could ever convert the rural poor to the cause 
of foreign interests that have nothing to do with our particular 
problems 
the rural poor make up 60 percent of el salvadors population of 
51 million 
four us army experts who studied el salvador also see the key 
to the war as lying with the loyalty of the rural poor 
cols james hallums richard white aj bacevich and thomas 
young addressed the subject in a paper they wrote in march at 
harvard university titled american military policy in small 
wars the case of el salvador 
of the campaign for the allegiance of the populace the officers 
concluded that disappointment with the outcome of previous 
efforts convinced hardcore salvadoran commanders to forget about 
hearts and minds in favor of pursuing guerrillas 
of the us role the paper says despite their appreciation 
that winning popular support remains as the ultimate strategic aim 
in counterinsurgency american officials have yet to devise 
adequate mechanisms to achieve that aim

when the sirroco blows up the adriatic from 
the deserts of libya venices lagoon swells up and spills into the 
city sirens sound a mournful reminder venice is losing its 
struggle with the environment 
even at the height of summer gondoliers ply their trade over 
murky green and often foulsmelling canals alive with algae 
thriving on tons of raw sewage 
but a group of scientists and engineers are finally preparing to 
test the prototype of a system to protect venice from the sea that 
once protected it 
after nearly four years of work and 700 million in costs the 
engineers in the fall will install at the lido entrance to the 
venice lagoon the prototype of a mobile dike designed to stem the 
flood tides that have troubled the citys past and threaten its 
future 
the goal of the project is to save venice to save the life of 
the lagoon to save the port to save the historic city and the 
economic life of its people said maurio fabris director of 
public relations for the venezia nuova new venice consortium 
he said the consortium of 26 italian companies is executing the 
10year 44 billionproject to build a line of mobile dikes 
across the lagoons three entrances shore up the sea walls and 
islands preserve the canals and restore the ecological balance in 
the polluted lagoon 
venetians built their island city along 150 winding canals to 
protect themselves from invaders now the threat comes from the sea 
that once guarded them 
high tides flood the city about 100 times a year corroding 
magnificent churches monuments and the marble walls of elegant 
villas 
the consortium intends to stem the tides with the mobile dikes 
strung across the bottom of the lagoon entrances during flood 
tides fabris said engineers will raise the dikes effectively 
sealing the lagoon ships will be able to sail in and out through a 
series of locks at the entrances 
with the mobile system we will be able to decide at what point 
and at what time we want to intervene said fabris 
flood tides are triggered by differences in atmospheric pressure 
at either end of the adriatic or by the sirocco wind blowing across 
the mediterranean and up the adriatic driving the sea water 
northward toward venice 
great flood tides were heavily destructive to venice in 789 in 
1268 and in 1280 in 1410 they killed close to 1000 people in 
this century the worst floods came in 1916 1936 1951 and in 
1966 when high water caused an estimated 85 million damage 
venetians have struggled for centuries to protect the city from 
its surroundings these efforts have included building sea walls to 
guard the littoral islands and several antisilting projects 
more recently they succeeded in stopping venice from sinking 
after it had settled 4 inches from 1926 to 1970 by banning 
industrial use of underground water 
critics say the government and the new consortium have reacted 
slowly to venices problems that the city has been drowning in a 
sea of bureacracy and empty talk 
the consortiums fabris responds that the law creating the 
project requires that all the work be experimentally tested 
reversible if necessary and done in stages 
scientists used satellite analysis and computer models to study 
how their work will effect the problems of stagnation and erosion 
scale models of the entire lagoon and the three entrances were 
built at italys hydraulic experimental center in nearby padua 
in september workers will install the prototype of one of the 
56foothigh 66footlong mobile dikes for six to eight months of 
tests 
fabris said the consortium will be ready to put the entire line 
of dikes in place by 1992 
he added that the tests indicate that engineers will be able to 
help wash pollutants out of the lagoon 
as part of the project the government is also supposed to enact 
laws restricting the dumping of industrial pollutants and the use 
of agricultural pesticides that seep into the lagoon

coppersmiths and carpenters still clatter 
today at their ancient crafts along the street called straight 
where the bible says st paul was cured of blindness 
venders peddle vials of perfume beneath roman columns near the 
great 8th century omayyed mosque stalls in the narrow market 
streets still dazzle with spices silver and silk in the city that 
saladin scourge of the crusaders called home 
some of damascuss old city survives but it is in danger of 
being swallowed by the sprawl of modern syria 
you cant imagine how important damascus is and how rich 
said afif bahnassi syrias director of antiquities 
hes one of about a dozen officials and experts named this year 
to a committee charged with saving the flavor and heritage of this 
ancient city termed the paradise of the orient by the 12th 
century spanish traveller ibn jubayer 
busy streets now flank the old roman walls and mudsided 19th 
century neighborhoods nearby have fallen to highways and modern 
housing needed for a growing metropolis of 3 million people 
even within the old walled city were afraid theres now 
some opinion to remove the old houses bahnassi said in an 
interview 
the committee has set conditions on development and is working 
to restore old neighborhoods bahnassi said it has asked owners to 
restore their own buildings and offers financial assistance for 
those who need help 
but he said it is difficult to find craftsmen skilled in the old 
buildings styles 
wed like to encourage the workers to be more interested in 
the old systems he said 
damascenes often refer to their city as the oldest still 
inhabited but its age is uncertain settlements excavated nearby 
date to about 10000 bc 
damascus itself is referred to in egyptian and other documents 
dating back about 4000 years bahnassi said 
arameans who migrated to the city from the deserts built a 
temple to the god haddad in about 1000 bc the romans used the 
same site for their temple to jupiter 
early christians built a cathedral on the roman foundations and 
elements of both remain in in the richly decorated omayyed mosque 
islams oldest surviving monumental mosque 
among its shrines is one holding the head of john the baptist 
revered by moslems as well as christians 
according to acts 9 in the new testament st paul then saul 
was stricken blind as he made his way to damascus to persecute the 
followers of christ he was taken to a house on the street called 
straight the account goes on it says ananias a follower of 
christ was instructed by a voice from heaven to find saul there 
and cure him of his blindness 
nearly all the great empires of middle eastern history fought 
over and conquered damascus whose oasis straddles three enduring 
trade routes connecting egypt arabia mesopotamia and europe 
early islamic authorities referred to damascus oasis as the 
site of the garden of eden 
the gardens encircle it like the halo round the moon ibn 
jubayer wrote in the 12th century 
some say cain slew abel on the slopes of mount kassioun on the 
citys western edge and placed abrahams birthplace there 
at the height of its glory under the islamic omayyed dynasty 
damascus was the capital of an arab empire that reached from spain 
to the edges of india 
yet despite its many wars nobody in its history destroyed it 
completely said harb farzat an historian at the university of 
damascus 
the crowded streets and bazaars of the old city still conjure 
images of medieval times upper stories project over the narrow 
lanes often nearly touching 
crumbling walls on some reveal the mud wattle and wood 
construction ibn jubayer noted in 1184 when saladin used the city 
as his capital during his successful campaign against the crusaders 
of jerusalem 
ornate stone doorways open onto the luxurious marble floors and 
fountains of restored turkish baths some dating to the 13th 
century and still in use 
coffee houses hundreds of years old still serve thick heavily 
sugared turkish coffee to men in arab garb who puff at waterpipes 
over games of backgammon 
but farzat who was born in the city said when youve seen 
damascus a generation before you can see how it has changed 
from a highrise hotel window he pointed at the sprawl of 
concrete now covering the ghouta the oasis gardens that led many 
ancient authors to liken damascus to paradise 
the greatest loss he said was to destroy the ghouta the 
paradise of damascus now its covered with buildings

a sea of fadedgreen tents has become 
home for 165000 refugees mostly women children and old men of 
a stalemated war in the desert of nearby western sahara 
fourcolor flags of the selfproclaimed sahrawi arab democratic 
republic flutter in the hot wind over banners and grafitti 
proclaiming the republics slogan the entire homeland or 
martyrdom 
the united nations and international relief organizations have 
been feeding and housing the refugees for more than a decade 
the refugees wait here in algeria for something to happen in the 
war between morocco and the marxistled polisario guerrilla 
movement for control of the western sahara formerly spanish sahara 
the algeriabacked polisario movement set up the sahrawi 
republic in 1976 after spain turned western sahara over to morocco 
and mauritania the latter has since withdrawn 
although the sahrawi republic won diplomatic recognition from 
more than 70 countries mostly in the third world it has been 
unable to gain a permanent foothold in the mineralrich territory 
the war has reached a stalemate and the guerrillas now talk of a 
compromise settlement but prospects seem distant and sporadic 
fighting continues 
polisario officials contend the refugees in camps near this 
algerian oasis represent virtually the entire population of the 
disputed territory 
spain held the western sahara until 1975 mainly to protect the 
nearby spanish canary islands little effort was made to develop 
the wilderness an area about the size of colorado spanish 
colonial records indicate the territory had a population of only 
75000 when spain pulled out 
at least 50000 now live under moroccan rule frequently 
proclaiming their loyalty to moroccos king hassan ii 
morocco maintains that more than threefourths of the tindouf 
refugees are not from western sahara but from neighboring 
mauritania niger mali and other impoverished countries on the 
fringes of the sahara desert 
arabicspeaking moslems they originally were nomads herding 
goats and camels over unmarked boundaries often not even aware 
which country they were in 
mahmoud hussein a highschool pupil studying in algiers spoke 
of the culture shock he experiences in traveling between the dual 
worlds of modern algiers and his family tent near tindouf 
i live in algiers nine months of the year and i hate it and 
long for my family he said sitting recently in the brightly 
decorated tent beside his younger sister habiba then when i 
come here for the three months of the summer im dying to return 
he shares his perplexity with hundreds of young people who 
travel to universities in cuba or spain 
polisario officials have set up a system to prevent loss of a 
national and cultural identity among the young and to reinforce 
their motivation to fight 
the young teach the old how to read and write said mohammed 
mahmoud a school teacher the old teach them history and 
tradition so as to enforce their sense of identity 
from age 9 the children also receive basic military training in 
preparation for automatic conscription after high school of boys 
who dont go on to university 
tindouf a military zone is 1000 miles southwest of algiers 
the refugee camps begin about two miles west of tindouf their 
rows of canvas tents and adjacent stone kitchens spread in clusters 
over the stark landscape 
at a camp hospital dr khadigetto alawi said she had just 
returned from five years of medical training in havana cuba she 
said she and the other hospital staff receive no salaries 
polisario officials said no one receives any pay including the 
16000man guerrilla army and 70000 officials a few raise goats 
and sheep for their own use they said 
a woman who identified herself as humayed welcomed a group of 
visiting reporters into the tent she shares with six women and 
children of her family she said their menfolk were at the 
front 120 miles away 
the women have an important role while the men are away at 
war said a roman catholic priest who goes by the name father 
gonzales and works for the caritas relief organization 
they marry young so as to have many children and they also 
undergo military training themselves we try to teach them the 
importance of motherchild care they concentrate a lot on 
preventive medicine 
a polisario official said it is expected that young war widows 
remarry quickly in order to maintain population growth ghalouha 
elsalm a war widowbride said she has spent the nine years since 
she lost her husband rearing a daughter but now is marrying again 
i have to continue having children she said explaining 
that it was a national requirement 
most of the women said they long to return to the western sahara 
and its cool atlantic breezes when the war is over

harassed by crop burnings air 
surveillance and cratering by police of illegal landing strips 
drug barons have begun to smuggle marijuana out of jamaica in 
shipments of pumpkins books and flipflop sandals 
business leaders say the traffic threatens jamaicas entire 
export industry which along with tourism is the economys most 
vibrant thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in precious 
foreign earnings are at stake 
the problem is critical said lascelles chin managing 
director of henkel chemicals if this is not curtailed we are 
all in for a tough time 
shippers say with the tough government measures against 
trafficking drug barons now are managing to slip marijuana or 
ganja as it is called here into legal cargoes some have been 
detected by us customs agents and the shipping companies even 
though they be be unaware of the shipments face heavy fines 
many have become reluctant to handle jamaican exports 
in february for example a kirk lines ship the mercandian 
supplier was found to be carrying 13000 pounds of marijuana in 
its cargo of crackers bound for miami fla the us customs 
service fined the company 103 million 
the biggest cargo carrier to serve this caribbean nation 
evergreen shipping of taiwan decided in june it will deliver but 
no longer accept containers in jamaica after us customs in new 
orleans found marijuana hidden aboard them in late 1986 the 
company is negotiating with us customs on the amount of fines to 
be imposed 
us customs ordinarily imposes fines at the rate of 500 an 
ounce of marijuana found but it offers companies the opportunity 
to present mitigating evidence in an effort to lower those set 
amounts 
four air jamaica planes have been seized in new york and miami 
after contraband drugs were found aboard 
exports are vital to this poor island nation of 24 million 
people where one of every four members of the work force is 
unemployed 
as world markets and prices collapsed in the 1980s for jamaicas 
traditional products bauxite from which aluminum is made sugar 
and bananas other exports have picked up the slack 
about 29000 jobs were created in factories making dresses 
pants and other clothes for us companies last year exports 
raised more than 700 million in foreign exchange which jamaica 
needs to buy oil machinery spare parts and food 
the exporters response to the ganja barons has been to screen 
employees implement tamperresistant packaging and monitor 
production and delivery closely 
i schedule it so my truck arrives at the dock as soon as the 
gangplank is dropped said garfield thomas explaining that it 
lessens the chances for marijuana to be hidden in his shipments of 
fruits and vegetables 
i give drivers cases of cold drinks and a can opener so they 
dont have to stop on the way and just hope they dont get a 
puncture flat tire 
thomas added however that he has reduced his shipments because 
the produce was spoiling on us docks while awaiting clearance by 
inspectors searching for drugs 
but as one ruse is uncovered another develops 
now were finding marijuana in false bulkheads and false 
roofs in the steel and fiberglass containers into which 
merchandise is loaded said francis kennedy president of the 
shipping association of jamaica weve never had this problem as 
much as during the past six to eight weeks 
laborers from india introduced ganja to jamaica in the mid19th 
century the subtropical climate is ideal for its cultivation the 
fastest growing varieties can be harvested every three months 
although cultivation and use of marijuana became common in 
jamaica it posed few problems until traffickers started exporting 
it in the 1970s cocaine smuggling increased as aircraft stopped 
over for refueling en route from south america to the united states 
jamaicas two main political parties have condemned drug 
trafficking and taken steps to halt it 
in the 1970s the peoples national party government of 
socialist prime minister michael manley ordered illegal airstrips 
spiked encouraged farmers to grow legal crops and seized 
contraband planes 
the current prime minster conservative edward seaga of the 
jamaica labor party which came to power in 1980 has imposed stiff 
sanctions on traffickers and threatened to shoot down drug planes 
thousands of acres of marijuana fields have been cut down and 
hundreds of tons of marijuana have been burned 
us funding particularly for the operation buccaneer crop 
eradication program increased to 34 million last year from 
49000 in 1984 
now farmers for whom ganja is their most marketable crop plant 
it on smaller patches in remote valleys and hillsides they also 
are experimenting with faster growing varieties neglecting 
traditional crops 
cocaine use meanwhile appears to be increasing among jamaicas 
upper and middle classes and trafficking is feared to be 
stimulating crime and corruption 
jamaican officials say they are grappling with the problem as 
best they can but they bristle at statements by us officials and 
at news accounts that they maintain cast jamaica in a bad light 
they cite as one example the allegation that political parties 
accept contributions from drug barons 
it is us citizens who are creating the demand for drugs 
subsidizing the planting of ganja in jamaica and organizing and 
managing the transporting of ganja from jamaica minister of 
public works pearnel charles was quoted as saying in a recent 
interview with the daily gleaner of kingston 
in april prime minster seaga lodged a formal protest with the 
us state department after he was linked in closeddoor testimony 
by a convicted drug trafficker before a senate subcommittee with 
accepting payoffs 
the state department responded that the charges were 
unsubstantiated

the reagan administrations crackdown 
on drug trafficking is upsetting us allies in the caribbean they 
complain the united states is maligning their leaders and 
encroaching on their sovereignty 
its just unsettling to people to hear that their leaders have 
been charged in a court in america when anyone who knows anything 
about justice knows these cases will never come up for a hearing 
said prime minister eugenia charles of dominica its not only 
wrong its incomprehensible 
the issue came up at a recent meeting of the leaders of 13 
former and current british colonies in the caribbean community 
caricom in antiguabarbuda 
the young parliamentary democracies most of which gained 
independence over the past 25 years drafted a letter to president 
reagan protesting us drug policy in the region

like good comedians certain investment analysts 
never run out of material 
as one respected member of that fraternity observed earlier this 
month they followed the monetarists in the early 1980s switched 
to oilwatching in 1985 and jumped to commodities last year 
and now drumroll please it is the meteorologists 
observes lucinda mezy director of equity research pnc financial 
corp a bankholding company based in philadelphia 
the drought that is has developed brand new commentaries on 
where the economy is headed billions of words have come from 
brokerage houses on what the drought means for food prices and 
therefore for stocks 
the political activities of 1988 provide myriad variations for 
commentaries on interest rates inflation stock prices and 
investor confidence each poll whether or not it shows changes is 
reason again for further commentary 
the iraniraq affair already has been worked into forecasts by 
analysts who could not think of anything more to say about 
nicarauga and the rest of central america and by bulls who had run 
out of things to say about glasnost 
fallback resources include the emergence of china as an 
industrial power the amount of money in circulation the budget 
and trade deficits the dollar the possibility of inflation or 
higher interest rates and third world debt 
increasingly analysts analyze analysts producing one of the 
oddest of all analyses one that states the stock market is about 
to rise when the majority of analysts are bearish and is set to 
fall when they turn bullish 
there is an open pit mine ready to be worked at any time in 
analyzing the disposition of investors do they have confidence do 
they have money will they buy cars and appliances will they save 
will they buy junk bonds 
government provides enough material often in controversial 
form to keep armies of analysts computing and dissecting lists of 
upcoming government economic announcements has become a regular 
feature of brokers letters 
a rise or fall in housing starts is good for hundreds of words 
on the consequences to securities inflation and interest rates 
jobless statistics factory capacity imports exports debt 
deficits all go into the mix 
still without these events institutions and subjects there 
would hardly be a drought of material on which to comment always 
there is the mine of statistical material that can be dug up and 
massaged by computer 
that resource was well used and thoroughly abused in the weeks 
and months immediately following the securities crash of last 
october the most common of the analyses producing statistics 
likening it to the great crash of 1929 
it mattered little that events failed to prove that 1987 was 
1929 all over again it simply provided more material for analysis 
on why the two years differed in themselves differences of 
opinion are fodder for analysis 
how all this helps investors is difficult to perceive but it is 
easy enough to see how it helps those who sell securities it keeps 
customers talking it maintains interest it provides material for 
sales calls 
but almost if not utterly lost in the mountain of commentary is 
the matter of accuracy it is then that the words are seen for what 
they are worth in investing those words just do not add up only 
the numbers do

before monica gonzalez goes to the united 
states in september to receive a prize for courageous reporting 
shell have to get permission from a chilean court 
pending against her are charges of criminally slandering 
president augusto pinochet and the armed forces he commands 
by law she must get approval to go abroad but she brushes that 
aside as just a minor annoyance compared to periodic arrests two 
stints in prison and daily death threats in the four years since 
she took on what she calls the holy trinity pinochet his 
family and the military 
her articles accusing pinochet and his rightwing government of 
abuse of power were cited by harvard universitys nieman foundation 
in awarding her this years louis m lyon prize it praised her 
courage in reporting objectively and honestly despite the 
governments efforts to silence her 
she plans to travel to boston to accept the award sept 15 but 
with a certain chagrin 
there are lots of chilean journalists who are facing legal 
charges but most arent as famous as i mrs gonzalez 38 said 
in an interview this bothers me a lot sometimes 
according to the local roman catholic churchs human rights 
office more than 30 journalists face criminal slander charges 
lodged by the government 
they include mrs gonzalez boss juan pablo cardenas director 
of the leftist magazine analisis he was convicted of offending the 
armed forces and is serving 541 nights in a jail cell he is at 
liberty during the daytime 
pinochet cites the existence of analisis and several other 
opposition publications as proof that chile has freedom of the 
press but according to mrs gonzalez theres a very high cost 
its a cost you pay every day 
she said her telephone rings constantly with death threats that 
cars full of armed men regularly park outside her home that a dead 
cat was once tossed into her yard 
certainly im afraid she said im afraid theyll kill 
me but ive made a choice ive taken a path of no return 
the choice was made in late 1983 she said when she began 
working for another opposition magazine cauce at the time a wave 
of antipinochet protests obliged the government to somewhat relax 
its strict control of the news media 
in early 1984 the magazine published the first of a series of 
investigative reports by mrs gonzalez alleging corruption by 
pinochet and members of his family and brutal human rights abuse by 
the military the articles which presented documentation and 
detail established her reputation as one of the countrys best 
opposition journalists and shattered a powerful taboo 
we broke a sacrosanct rule that existed in the opposition 
press dont mention pinochet his family or the armed forces this 
is the holy trinity she said 
in the years since mrs gonzalez has been arrested 10 times and 
imprisoned twice in connection with her reporting 
her first imprisonment was in july 1984 she said she was put in 
a small exposed cell in a maximumsecurity punishment block 
occupied by about 20 common criminals who had led a prison riot 
three months earlier many still wore bandages on their wounds 
she was the first woman they had seen since being isolated and 
regularly beaten after the riot she said they filled the hall 
outside her cell screaming and pressing against the bars while 
they exposed themselves and performed obscene acts 
the bars were thin and she feared they would cave in 
it went on all night long she said i didnt think i was 
going to be able to stand it it was very terrible 
the next morning at her tearful insistence she was moved to a 
section for woman political prisoners she spent six days there 
before being released 
she would return in october 1987 for 22 days after publishing 
an interview with an opposition leader andres zaldivar who 
sharply criticized pinochet 
the case sent chills through the chilean jouralistic community 
and prompted denunciations from press organizations around the 
world although the interview was published in textual 
questionandanswer form mrs gonzalez and not zaldivar was 
charged with slandering the president government prosecutors said 
she was responsible because she served as the vehicle for his 
remarks 
the case remains pending as do two others in which she is 
accused of slandering a military prosecutor and the armed forces in 
general five previous cases against her have ended in acquittal 
she said she considers her most important story a series of 
interviews in late 1984 with a deserter from the secret police who 
recounted the torture and killing of 15 leftists some were old 
friends of hers she said 
in seeking confirmation of the deserters tale she sought the 
help of a human rights activist jose parrada and a communist who 
survived detention by the secret police manuel guerrero 
parrada and guerrero along with a third man santiago nattino 
were found dead with their throats slashed in march 1985 
why they let me live i dont know mrs gonzalez said

fertile soil is sparse in egypt just 6 
million acres along the nile and the government is cracking down 
on those who use it to make bricks 
at a brickyard here one recent day workers swarmed like bees 
over a kiln as they dismantled a brickyard that had fallen victim 
to the government order 
the governments intend is to preserve egypts arable land to 
help feed an exploding population now 53 million and growing at a 
rate of 12 million a year 
after five years of loose application of a law banning the use 
of fertile topsoil to make bricks the government in december set a 
sixmonth deadline and recently sent police out to see that an 
estimated 1700 affected brickyards indeed close down 
we admit that this is the first time the law has been 
effective said farouk zaki head of the department responsible 
for land protection at the agriculture ministry 
the owners realized that we were serious this time and all the 
brickyards stopped functioning on deadline without violence 
the decree requires brickyard owners to switch from the ageold 
process of making bricks by hand with topsoil to a mechanized one 
that makes bricks only with pure clay thus eliminating the use of 
topsoil 
violators of the topsoil ban face six months in prison and a 
fine 
officials acknowledged that the decree has troublesome 
sideeffects a growing black market in bricks and unemployment for 
about 70000 workers 
only 41 of the dismantled brickyards so far have switched to the 
mechanized method at a cost the equivalent in egyptian pounds of 
13000 to 650000 zaki said he added that 200 others were 
expected to follow suit 
at the moment the price of bricks is rising steeply because 
of the law enforcement said mohammed ramez responsible for 
buildingmaterial control at the housing ministry 
he said black market prices of the machineproduced bricks are 
double the official 30 for 1000 
we expect to have a complete balance between supply and demand 
within five years ramez added the enforcement of the law he 
said has resulted in a shortage of 2 billion to 3 billion bricks 
this year 
officials estimate that about 4500 acres of arable land have 
become unproductive in the last 20 years because topsoil was 
stripped for bricks the loss is considerable for a country that 
produces only 40 percent of its food and must import the rest to 
feed its burgeoning population 
some people used to remove earth down to 10 meters 30 
feet said zaki of the agriculture ministry any removal 
weakens the soil taking away essential nutrients and raises the 
water table 
we are requiring owners to reclaim their land at a cost of 
10000 to 15000 pounds 4300 to 6500 per acre zaki said 
he estimated this would take at least two years 
the removal of topsoil began in the early 1970s after the high 
dam at aswan went into operation and held back flood waters bearing 
tons of silt that originally was used in the brick industry 
as construction boomed in egypt and the demand for bricks 
skyrocketed some farmers abandoned their crops to make as much as 
70 times more money by selling topsoil or making bricks on their 
own 
earth bricks brought us enormous profits said ahmed 
aburawash a former brickyard owner in giza 
in a good month i would make 3000 pounds 1300 with earth 
from one of my acres 
he maintained that no harm is done to land scraped two meters 
about six feet deep anything can be planted on it 
aburawash has switched to raising cattle and has turned most of 
his brickyard into a banana plantation which he said brings only a 
quarter of the profit he made from bricks 
his employees whose numbers have been trimmed from 50 to 20 
were busy one recent day dismantling one kiln with 22 others to be 
taken down in the neighborhood 
they were worried about their future 
this is my first day of work since all the brickyards shut 
down last month abdelhamid sharafeddin said 
i will work on the other kilns and then who knows people like 
me are pushed aside i know nothing but brickmaking

in the 25 years he spent in jail as one of 
latin americas longestheld political prisoners napoleon ortigoza 
could sleep only when the light bulbs in his cell blew out 
it happened he said about once every three months and when the 
guards in his paraguayan prison noticed it they quickly put in 
fresh bulbs 
but the lights burning night and day the beatings the 
submersion in water and 18 years in 6by6foot cell didnt 
humiliate him as much he said as being tortured by a policeman 
who ranked far below him a captain in the paraguayan army 
i never thought a policeman could get away with torturing an 
officer thats a crime the 56yearold ortigoza said in an 
interview here 
they beat me tied me up and held me under water but nothing 
hurt as much as when they ripped off my captains braids 
he was sent to prison dec 17 1962 on grounds that he was 
involved in a military plot to overthrow paraguays longtime 
authoritarian president gen alfredo stroessner and that he had a 
role in the death of an army cadet alberto benitez charges he 
has steadfastly denied from the beginning 
this past dec 17 25 years to the day he was sent to prison 
ortigoza was released he was granted political asylum in spain in 
june 
ortigoza blames his suffering on stroessner now 75 who has 
ruled paraguay since he seized power in 1954 
i know he gave the order for my arrest he robbed me of my 
career origoza said 
origoza enlisted in the paraguayan army in 1949 graduated at 
the top of his class as a lieutenant and placed fourth when 
promoted to captain 
he was one of five army captains among 20 middlelevel officers 
convicted after stroessner moved to smash a rumored plot in army 
ranks 
at the time ortigoza was serving as a staff officer to cmdr 
sixto dure franco one of several regiment commanders supposedly 
involved in the alleged army plot dure franco and the others were 
subsequently reconciled with stroessner and promoted to the highest 
posts in the military 
i knew better than to get involved in some antistroessner 
game ortigoza said in the interview he said he knew of the coup 
plans however through dure franco 
shortly after his arrest ortigoza faced a civil court that 
found him innocent of all charges 
he was then brought before a military court that convicted him 
of involvement in the coup and the murder of the cadet he was 
sentenced to death but the sentence was reduced later to 25 years 
in prison 
police forced me to write a letter implicating myself in the 
cadets murder ortigoza said 
the lowerranking officers became the scapegoats once 
stroessner decided he didnt want to create a shakeup among the 
higher officers 
in 1978 the organization of american states oas reviewed 
ortigozas case and concluded it was arbitary and political and 
a very grave violation of his human rights 
after the oas conclusions paraguayan authorities permitted 
roman catholic church officials to visit ortigoza every four 
months his family could visit once a week 
he spent the first 18 years of his sentence in what he described 
as brutal conditions at a military police facility in asuncion 
paraguays capital 
in october 1980 ortigoza was moved to a more comfortable 
9by15foot cell with a bathroom 
the idea that sustained me through my time in jail was the 
certainty i felt that i would some day be able to correct the 
injustice done to me he said 
but his problems did not end with his release from prison in 
december 
the interior ministry sent ortigoza to the san estanislao 
military garrison 120 miles north of asuncion the supreme court 
accused the ministry of kidnapping ortigoza and ordered him sent 
back to asuncion where he was then placed under unofficial house 
arrest at his mothers home 
after i got tired of that one of my lawyers helped me to 
escape in a car ortigoza said that was march 23 
police guards fired machine guns at the car but we got away 
we hadnt planned to go to the colombian embassy but when we saw 
the gate to the compound open we zipped right in 
ortigoza spent 83 days there 
on june 15 after talks with diplomats from colombia spain and 
argentina paraguay dropped its opposition to giving ortigoza safe 
conduct out of the country 
the next day he arrived in buenos aires argentina and 
immediately departed for madrid 
many countries and human rights organizations had called for his 
release over the years norway offered him a lifetime pension if he 
accepted its offer of asylum 
but he said he chose spain for reasons of language and 
culture 
ortigoza now lives in a faculty apartment at madrid university 
where he was recently joined by his wife and one of his two 
daughters 
he recounts his experiences to students of latin american 
politics in a project funded by the spanish foreign ministrys 
institute for iberoamerican cooperation 
while stroessner is alive there is no chance of reopening my 
case ortigoza said in the interview but i am prepared to 
defend the truth to the end

this dusty arab village on jerba 
island is inhabited mostly by jews whose ancestors were among the 
earliest middle east refugees 2400 years ago uneasy about 
israelarab tension nowadays they tend to keep a low profile 
most speak only arabic and dress like the tunisian peasants who 
predominate on the island off tunisias southern mainland their 
forefathers came with phoenician traders after the destruction of 
solomons temple in 586 bc more than a millenium before the 
foundation of islam and the arab invasions of north africa 
almost throughout this long history they have lived among the 
local population in harmonious and brotherly coexistence said 
haim madar tunisias chief rabbi himself born 55 years ago in a 
moorishstyle family home in hara khebira 
he attributed occasional friction and acts of antijewish 
vandalism to arab youths whipped up by events in the middle east 
israel creates some problems for us he said if it were 
not for israel we would live here as happily as ever 
hai moussa haddad a local jewish jeweler said the arab 
population is aware the jews have unspoken emotional and religious 
links with israel which has therefore become a political 
embarrassment for those of us who want to remain in tunisia the 
land of our fathers 
madar attended a talmudic school and speaks only hebrew and 
tunisian arabic 
we must thank the authorities for all they have done for the 
survival of the jewish faith in tunisia he said through an 
interpreter we are regarded as an integral part of the tunisian 
people 
at the same time he added the government makes a distinction 
between jews and zionists those who try to promote jewish 
resettlement in palestine 
the authorities continuously remind tunisians that a jew is 
not necessarily a zionist he said those jews who decide to 
leave are free to go anywhere as for me i was born here i belong 
here and i am staying here 
a police station is in the same building as the synagogue in 
nearby hara ghriba mader said he warmly welcomed the police 
presence at the synagogue visited by hundreds of tourists daily 
during the summer season 
the 116squaremile island is among tunisias main tourist 
centers 
painted in blue outside many jewish homes are symbolic outlines 
of menorahs the candelabra used in jewish rites combined with 
fish 
they are intended as a protection against the evil eye 
madar said it is a very ancient custom jewish doctrine 
disapproves of it but we dont interfere 
every year in may crowds of jews come on a pilgrimage from 
tunis and elsewhere to commemorate rabbi shimon bar yuhai an early 
jewish mystic reputed to have had special links with jerba 
a marble plaque in the ghriba synagogue claims this sacred 
and antique place dates from the destruction of solomons first 
temple in 586 before our era 
in fact local records indicate the whitewashed building was 
erected in the 1920s the latest in a succession of jewish shrines 
built on the same spot over the centuries 
former president habib bourguiba of tunisia attended jewish 
religious services there in 1966 to mark his respect for the 
community the jews bourguiba said brought baraka good luck 
to tunisia 
despite the official protection vandals regularly fling garbage 
over the wall into the fouracre jewish cemetery in hara khebira 
many tombstones engraved with hebrew inscriptions were deliberately 
smashed years ago 
we can do nothing about it madar said if we clean it up 
it will only start again 
the islands police chief said he had received no complaints of 
antijewish violence or vandalism the police chief who cannot be 
identified by name under government regulations said it was a 
very sensitive subject a political rather than a police matter 
one jewish resident requesting anonymity said complaints only 
generate more friction 
we generally live in peace here as long as we keep quiet about 
those who dont like us 
during the 1967 middle east war tunisian rioters burned down 
the main synagogue in tunis 400 miles to the north the 
ringleaders were punished and the government paid for restoration 
of the building 
most of tunisias jews live in tunis but they are involved in 
the capitals modern life and are rapidly losing their faith 
madar said only in jerba is our religion intact jews here never 
smoke or drink on the sabbath their children like mine attend 
religious schools 
like many of the men in hara khebira madar was temporarily 
unshaven in ritual mourning for solomons temple 
jews enjoyed official protection throughout the five centuries 
of turkish spanish and french domination when french colonial 
rule ended in 1956 some 120000 jews lived in tunisia many had 
acquired french citizenship 
newly independent tunisia backed the arab cause in the middle 
east leading to a massive exodus of the nations jewish minority 
to israel and france madar said tunisia now has only 2700 jewish 
residents 900 of them in jerba 
tunisian jews are often craftsmen tailors butchers or 
jewelers madar said only one has qualified as an engineer many 
jews are active in the tourist industry very few are wealthy 
but several members of a prominent italian jewish family named 
pariente have elaborate tombs in the hara khebira cemetery madar 
said the family contributed substantially to the upkeep of jerbas 
synagogues 
the patriarch guido pariente died in l954 his tomb has been 
desecrated and partly destroyed 
undisturbed nearby are the fresh tombs of madars mother and 
father 
as he passed madar knelt down in the burning sun and kissed his 
parents tombstones engraved with hebrew inscriptions

land reform the most radical 
and expensive government project in el salvadors history has 
benefited more than half a million people since its inception in 
1980 and is radically changing the social structure of the 
countryside 
despite major shortcomings the program has redistributed 30 
percent of the countrys arable land after compensating former 
owners the 520000 people who have received land either as 
individuals or members of cooperatives make up a quarter of the 
countrys rural poor 
the program however is beset by such problems as flagging 
production tight credit deficient administration and alleged 
corruption it is also hampered by el salvadors guerrilla war 
land reform was designed principally by us officials as a 
means of undercutting the leftist guerrillas in their efforts to 
win the sympathy of the rural poor 
a dozen government and military officials cooperativists 
peasants and international development officials interviewed said 
while the toughest years of land reform are past obstacles remain 
in extending it and ensuring its smooth running 
some former landowners have not abandoned the idea of 
recovering their lands and with them real power they recall with 
nostalgia their wealth said francisco flores president of the 
salvadoran institute for agrarian transformation the government 
body primarily responsible for land reform 
but he added that the vast majority of the former owners have 
accepted compensation and that title to the property has been 
legally transferred 
the process has cost almost 300 million most of it provided by 
the united states 
agrarian reform is enshrined in the 1983 constitution which 
would have to be scrapped if big holdings were to again be 
concentrated in few hands 
some leftofcenter cooperativists and officials of the 
governing christian democratic party are concerned that the right 
wing which won control of the legislature in march elections 
might try to undo some of the reform 
the rightist republican nationalist alliance known as arena is 
considered in a good position to challenge the christian democrats 
in presidential elections scheduled for march 
orlando arevalo director of the national finance entity for 
agricultural lands said a marked increase has been noted in 
expulsions of land reform beneficiaries in recent months he blames 
former owners emboldened by arenas legislative victory and 
prospects for gaining the presidency next year 
most landholders are licensed to carry arms arevalo said 
the former owners who have always opposed the reform are now 
encouraged and are fighting the campesinos politically juridically 
and by force 
but he said virtually all of the 500 or so recent expulsions 
were from small holdings and represent a tiny percentage of the 
reformed sector he said the government is resorting to the courts 
and the military to get the small farmers reinstated 
he noted however that the judiciary has been dominated for 
decades by the rightwingers who might favor the landowners 
phase i of land reform expropriated all holdings over 1235 
acres involving 477 properties owned by 262 families a subsequent 
landtothetiller law affected small holdings and benefited about 
45000 families 
the phase i lands were converted into 329 cooperatives 25 of 
which have been abandoned because they are in war zones about 
30000 families live and work on the 304 phase i cooperatives 
according to flores and international development officials 
working with the reform a third of the cooperatives are able to 
finance operations pay debts and dividends to their members 
another third are described as bankrupt basket cases that 
cannot succeed in their current structure 
the remaining third are described as borderline 
arenas platform calls for the dismantling of all but the most 
successful cooperatives dividing the unsuccessful and borderline 
ventures into parcels that would be transferred by title to the 
farmers working them the party contends that only by converting el 
salvador into a country of property owners will there be 
sufficient incentive and initiative to spur production 
the christian democrats after seeing many millions of dollars 
lost have already begun dividing up the failed cooperatives into 
family plots 
the political decision is to divide said flores 
one divided venture is the 2100acre la normandia cooperative 
usulutan province 65 miles southeast of san salvador before being 
expropriated from dona maria de dalton in 1980 it produced cotton 
for export with small sections dedicated to the corn and beans 
consumed by the peasants who worked it 
two months into this years growning season with abundant rains 
after two years of drought it is a green sea of thighhigh corn 
divided in 85acre plots it is home for 170 families who live in 
mudbrick tileroofed houses with wells but without running water 
or electricity it has a school but no clinic 
a mile into the fields along an oxentrod path marcial lopez 
worked with his wife maria and two of their eight children tending 
tomato plants along the edge of their plot most of which was sown 
with corn 
lopez talked of his years in the landreform program 
from 80 to 86 we had credit from the government and we 
planted cotton but we only showed losses those who are up in arms 
the guerrillas would attack each year right before we were going 
to spray and destroy or damage the plants without pesticide the 
crop was always bad he said 
part of the guerrillas strategy is to sabotage of the national 
economy which is heavily dependent on exports of coffee sugar and 
cotton 
the cooperative decided last year to divide the land into family 
plots leaving some fallow and some to be rented or parceled out to 
eventual new beneficiaries of the agricultural reform 
asked if hed prefer to continue working as part of a 
cooperative or have title to his plot lopez responded both ways 
are good individually if we have financing we would probably 
make the land produce more but the cooperative could also produce 
good results under better conditions and it would provide more 
work for more people 
the cooperative is considered one of the basketcases

editors note for a nation with its illustrious seagoing past 
the united states has let its merchant marine nearly sink out of 
sight only one in four graduates of the seven merchant marine 
academies find a berth on an american vessel these days that seems 
a waste of hard training some say and raises another question 
what if another big war or other emergency should suddenly require 
uncle sam to find his sea legs again 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

<TEXT>
if without donning scuba gear you would find out how deep the 
us merchant marine has sunk into oblivion consider this 
the actual love boat on tvs love boat is norwegian 
why then are one federal and six state maritime academies in 
the united states still in business when the nations merchant 
ships are barely afloat are these young sailors training to man a 
titanic 
good question difficult answer 
in business the schools are albeit with trimmed sails they 
turn out some 725 graduates a year only a minority of whom will 
actually fill a berth at sea the rest like their recent 
predecessors will find places with port authorities shipping and 
stevedoring firms the navy tugboats ship designers marinas 
yacht yards an admiralty law office or two one is relief captain 
of the mississippi excursion sternwheeler delta queen a few are 
weathermen 
the last stand of the us merchant marine is in these 
academies says frank braynard museum curator of the us 
merchant marine academy at kings point on new yorks long island 
a last stand george custer could commiserate with 
in 1986 goods worth 3205 billion entered or left the united 
states by sea only 4 percent of it was in american bottoms while 
90plus percent of the earths trade moves by sea in some 25000 
ships the us merchant fleet numbered just 371 active oceangoing 
vessels 11th worldwide panama was first with 3278 ships russia 
second with 2453 the last ocean merchant ship built in a us 
yard 76 of which have closed since 1980 was launched last year 
none is currently building none is on order 
a presidential commission on the merchant marine and defense 
headed by former us sen jeremiah denton of alabama predicted 
last december that unless actions are taken the number of ships and 
seamen will drop by onehalf by the year 2000 rear adm kenneth m 
curtis president of the maine maritime academy in castine cites a 
navy estimate of a shortage of 8100 trained seamen in the military 
sea lift command alone 
to keep that shortfall from getting worse is one reason the 
academies survive the united states has about 100 ships mothballed 
that could be commissioned in five to 10 days in a national 
emergency but you cant mothball crews to man them 
but should there be world war iii and should it be fought as the 
first two some see the maritime weakness of the united states as 
the possible achilles heel 
our merchant fleet bears the heavy onus of being the first of 
our heavy industries exported overseas says rear adm paul l 
krinsky superintendent of kings point but were not static 
buggy whip manufacturers went broke because they thought they were 
in the buggy whip business instead of transportation americans 
are once again pioneering this time in intermodalism the fine 
art of combining and coordinating road rail and air freight for 
sea transport or vice versa 
thirty years ago half of americas seamen came up the 
hawsepipe the only requirement for promotion was to pass 
successive coast guard exams at minimum threeyear intervals on the 
ladder from seaman to mate to captain or chief engineer today 17 
percent of licensed officers are graduates of kings point alone 
the first academy for commercial mariners dates back a century 
the progenitor was adm stephen b luce a graduate of the us 
naval academy at annapolis where merchant sailors have been mildly 
deprecated as the black shoe navy luce proposed that coastal 
cities set up facilities to train sailors 
in 1874 new york city acquired the old sloopofwar st mary 
for use as a floating school she was succeeded by the armed 
frigate newport which was towed around the harbor with faculty and 
students to wherever the cheapest berth could be found 
in the 1930s president franklin d roosevelt a former naval 
person eyed fort schuyler at the bronx entrance to the east river 
as a site for a permanent land school the fort which had never 
fired a shot and whose only scar was a bar sawed out by a prisoner 
escaping from the brig was also eyed by new yorks 
roadparkbridge visionary robert moses 
it would make a fine park said moses 
a fine school said the president so the new york maritime 
academy moved in among the cannons and abides now a part of the 
state university of new york and named suny maritime college 
meanwhile roosevelt saw the need for a federal counterpart a 
complement to annapolis west point and the coast guard academy 
the us merchant marine had been embarrassed in 1934 by the 
burning of the morro castle off the new jersey coast which took 
125 lives some officers abandoned ship before the passengers fire 
hoses didnt fit professionalism was needed and there was war in 
the air to roosevelt the merchant marine was the fourth arm of 
the military 
the merchant marine act of 1936 thereupon created a national 
maritime academy two years later the first corps assembled coast 
guard bases and even fort schuyler were used until a permanent home 
was found in walter chryslers former summer home at kings point on 
long island across the sound from fort schuyler 
in 1948 kings point went to a fouryear bachelor of science 
program today students take courses to be deck officers or 
engineers with additional training in management logistics some 
humanities and swimming a requirement they are appointed by 
congressmen as at other service academies in exchange for a free 
education they must maintain a mariners license for 10 years 
serve in the naval reserve for eight and work in the maritime 
industry ashore or at sea

of this junes 213 graduates 17 of whom were women eight of 
those engineers 28 entered the military about the recent 
average thirty percent of the class of 87 found slots at sea 45 
percent jobs ashore 20 percent joined the military and 5 percent 
went on to graduate school all students receive a years training 
aboard a us flag merchantman 
suny maritime college on the other hand sends its 750 students 
out for two months every summer aboard the empire state the former 
passenger liner president jackson they do everything from 
navigating to running the engines to chipping paint 
the advantage of our system over kings point is that our 
students run the ship under supervision they are at the mercy of 
whatever captain they serve under as to how much they are taught 
says dr william porter the academys vice president 
suny grads must also be able to tie 21 knots which most put off 
learning until the last minute unaware that a horneyhanded bosn 
will time them with a stopwatch they have to swim too 
our kids have more flexibility than kings point says bob 
hogg suny director for community affairs kings pointers have 
their service commitment ours in dry times can go to places like 
consolidated edison if they are engineers a marine architect can 
go into an architectural firm we can also take older students 
foreigners and those who cant pass the kings point physical 
with the prevalence of union requirements it is a rare tar 
these days who becomes an officer up the hawsepipe and probably 
only a foolhardy one even tries says porter 
few seek out the academies because of the romance of the 
sea says krinsky quickly loaded containers have done away with 
languorous or lascivious days in port students come for technical 
training or because friends or family had 
they are middleclass achievementoriented kids who have been 
encouraged by parents and teachers krinsky says their sats 
arent harvardyale but their achievement is comparable after 
graduation kings point alumni are a whos who of leaders in the 
maritime world 
kings points focus is more narrow than ours says hogg 
whose school offers so many courses that students uniformed as are 
those at kings point and other academies cant march to class 
they are training future officers ours get that training plus 
twentyfive years out just over half of the kings point grads 
are still in the maritime field a slightly better record than the 
other service academies sixty percent of the fort schuyler 
graduates go into the maritime business and the rest into allied 
occupations one gary jobson was tactician on an americas cup 
defender fort schuyler has benefited handsomely by being official 
sponsor of several cup yachts which it gets to sell when the races 
are over 
besides the school in maine there are maritime academies in 
massachusetts texas california and michigan all staterun and 
all of them says porter are concerned with dwindling 
enrollments 
a forthright commencement speaker at any of the academies would 
warn that the sea americanstyle is not an encouraging field 
there are billets for only 4116 deck and engineering officers on 
us flag vessels 
in 1980 80 percent of the graduates of maritime academies 
found shipboard positions says eugene rose president of 
seatrain lines this number was reduced to about 25 percent last 
year 
to share the work available unions rotate jobs so that some 
mariners are at sea only four months a year 
for years neglect vacillating policies greed and crime have 
beset the us merchant fleet dockside theft was so bad in new 
york one shoe company sent the lefts in one shipment and the rights 
in another to frustrate twolegged looters 
the unions once a favorite whipping boy to blame for the high 
costs of us shipping are ready for an agreement with anyone 
says braynard its very hard to say they are to blame when they 
were riding high they rode high but they were no more lousy when 
they had power than the shipowners when they did its a human 
nature situation 
human nature however has not launched ships since helen of 
troy economics does and military need here again its an alice 
in wonderland world the united states does have a respectable 
container fleet but you cant fit a tank in a box container ships 
need dockside cranes you dont find those on invasion beaches 
to qualify for the 250 million in operating subsidies uncle sam 
pays american shipping a year the ships must be built in american 
yards but as the denton commission noted american yards are a 
highly endangered species even for military vessels a south 
korean yard can build a ship for a third of what an american yard 
would charge several years ago congress recognized this by 
opening a window to let us companies build overseas then it 
closed the window at the same time us carriers are required to 
replace their fleets periodically in order to qualify for subsidies 
in such logical whirlpools the american merchant marine spins 
rudderless to some observers 
i dont think we can be totally dependent on the rest of the 
world says krinsky who would ever say let foreign airlines 
on our domestic routes or foreign railroads but shipping 
in step with reaganomics kings point has cut back enrollment 25 
percent over the last five years if the merchant marine were 
simply a commercial industry this might be a resigned 
acknowledgement of the practicalities if on the other hand the 
merchant marine is indeed an arm of the military shouldnt this be 
as alarming as the scuttling of every fourth aircraft carrier to 
the staffs of the maritime academies it is

the decline of the us merchant marine seems all the more 
notable in a nation with an illustrious seagoing past 
in its birth and infancy america was basically an island you 
had to take a boat to get there ships were the highways of the 
colonies 
seamen still boys came up the hawsepipe to learn before 
the mast nathaniel bowditch the great navigator got his start 
selling pulleys and marlin spikes as a young ship chandler until he 
learned enough ropes to go to sea young lads from nantucket and 
new bedford shipped out on whalers across the globe came home 
after years and signed on again as mates 
whalers lit the lamps of a young nation slavers in their vile 
trade populated the cotton fields shipborne immigrants populated 
the whole country fast americandesigned clippers from baltimore 
and new england outsped the world around the horn in the china 
trade 
john fitch drove the first practicable steamboat on the delaware 
river in 1789 20 years before robert fulton fitch also 
demonstrated he was ahead of his time by dying of a morphine 
overdose in 1806 frederic tudor displayed yankee maritime 
ingenuity by eschewing harvard as a place for loafers like all 
colleges and exporting around the world what wintry new england 
had plenty of ice 
the tide began turning in the 1840s when britain subsidized the 
new cunard line on the north atlantic run in 1847 congress 
followed suit by subsidizing building ships for the bremen line 
jointly owned by americans and the citystate of bremen carrying 
the flag became national policy and pride in america shippers 
were thus over the years alternately lulled and starved by 
congressional and presidential whim with the purse strings 
the real deepsix was epitomized by the man frank braynard 
curator of the us merchant marine academy at kings point ny 
calls that wretch horace greeley when he advised americas 
young men to go west they did ironically in prairie schooners a 
nation turned its back on its ocean heritage 
the seaman changed from the town hero to the local drifter 
says braynard a steamfired advocate of a return to maritime 
greatness the need for labor in the unitred states was so great 
any loose men were drawn to jobs in the heartland never again 
would an increasingly rich america be able to match the low wages 
often heavily subsidized of foreign merchantmen the glory days 
were largely done 
in the century after the civil war the united states built only 
10 liners for the lucrative north atlantic passenger business 
not that knowhow didnt exist in world war ii the united 
states built 6000 ships a third of the worlds merchant fleet to 
defeat germany and japan using assembly line techniques a 
california yard built a 10000ton liberty ship in just over three 
days but at the end of the war the united states which by then 
had almost half of the worlds tonnage gave away much of its fleet 
to its stricken allies a nice thing to do particularly for some 
wily greeks with names like onassis and niarchos 
the yanks did not lose their ingenuity malcolm mclean started 
the container ship revolution with the bright idea of putting truck 
trailers on the unused deck space of a coastal tanker americans 
invented the ship that loads and unloads itself with its own 
lighters 
then the whole world zapped us with our own ideas says 
braynard his exasperation at full ahead

editors note shes a human jukebox an anonymous disc jockey 
spinning ancient records and piping the music to a handful of 
pittsburgh bars via an antiquated telephone system her father 
invented 60 years ago helen reutzel is one of the other folks a 
woman who enjoys neither fortune nor fame but she loves what shes 
doing for sentimental reasons 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
drop two bits into an oldfashioned mahogany 
jukebox in a pittsburgh tavern and helen reutzel will spin a 
memory in the form of a song 
its a jukebox with a twist a human jukebox with a collection 
of more than 100000 records dating back to the 1920s and an 
assortment of customers who would never plunk a quarter into cheap 
mechanical imitations 
if you want to hear squaws along the yukon or headbanging 
music you can helen has everything says dan casagrande 39 
owner of brandys restaurant which has had mrs reutzels 
telephone music for 10 years 
you can come in here depressed and you hear these songs and 
all of a sudden it really does boost you up says nancy delaney 
54 of pittsburgh as she stirs a drink at brandys bar i hope 
this woman is a millionaire because she deserves to be if she only 
realized the pleasure she brings to people 
pick up a black phone on top of the jukebox and a raspy voice 
at a studio across town cheerily asks your preference 
not sure of the title no problem hum a few bars and chances 
are mrs reutzel knows it 
afraid the song is a little dated or obscure for an extra 1 
shell head to the attic and blow the dust off the lesspopular 
tunes 
want to personalize the song an additional 50 cents buys a 
dedication 
attention your attention please mrs reutzel broadcasts 
into one of the five bars she services this next song is a 
special dedication to scott from arizona we hope you get lucky 
tonight scott 
how it all works is not quite clear to mrs reutzel her father 
devised the system about 60 years ago by using old radio tubes and 
copper telephone lines when he died 12 years ago the secret of 
telephone music went with him and his daughter claims no one has 
been able to duplicate it 
songs are played over telephone lines from a studio on the 
citys north side to speakers in the bars around the city 
studio though may be too grand a word its actually a 
secondfloor walkup hidden because of the extensive record 
collection in a boardedup brick building approached from a dimly 
lit courtyard off a back alley 
the linoleum is worn the walls need a fresh coat of paint and 
any unusable space is covered with papers ashtrays or coffee cups 
row after row of records line the perimeter of the small room and 
opposite a switchboard are three tiers of turntables 
everybody has a wild fantasy of what the place looks like it 
can be anything they want says mrs reutzel a salty woman who 
calls everyone babe or honey they imagine me as a 
27yearold blonde or whatever they think were beautiful and 
sexy 
although mrs reutzel wont give her age she was slightly 
miffed when a local columnist said her salad days are wilted 
upon hearing a shrill pingping sound which signals two 
quarters being deposited in a jukebox mrs reutzel plugs a wire 
into the switchboard and picks up her handset 
telephone music what do you want to hear hon 
no one answers 
number please this is your jukebox talking i can hear you 
laughingwhat were you doingyou lost a quarter under the 
machine she says chuckling dont do that if you move it and 
it dont play ill be on your youknowwhat go ahead honey ill 
give it to you dont worry about it well leave it for the 
sweeper 
the caller requests teach me tonight by the decastro 
sisters one of several irreplaceable records held together by duct 
tape other records especially the old 78s are so warped coins 
have to be placed on the arm of the turntable so the needle doesnt 
skip

although the quality of the recordings isnt firstrate a corps 
of regular telephone music customers would rather have a scratchy 
song than none at all 
on most of the cracked records we have watch sticks so we 
can monitor it and catch it mrs reutzel says with a throaty 
laugh but sometimes if youre real busy and dont pay attention 
and its going clunk clunk clunk the bartenders will call up 
and say youre playing our song again 
decades ago mrs reutzel isnt sure how many her father 
owned several studios and had 120 jukeboxes distributed in bars 
around the country but telephone music waned with the popularity 
of radio and home stereo systems and little by little the slick 
handmade jukeboxes were put into storage 
when her father died mrs reutzel took over the business for 
sentimental more than monetary reasons bar owners get 40 percent 
of each quarter dropped into their jukebox and mrs reutzel gets 60 
percent with only five jukeboxes out the trickle of quarters 
isnt enough to pay the volunteers who help her on weekends 
i inherited it from my father and i didnt know what to do 
she says it was his baby his dream she says 
dream analysis is her true love and shed rather devote more 
time giving classes than spinning records but she says she keeps 
hanging on like a rat terrier even though there have been 
times shes been unable to pay her bills 
its a love thing with the people on the jukebox she says 
people will call up that havent been in town for years and tell 
me what theyre doing one guy came on and said do you remember 
me he said there isnt a day that goes by i dont think of you 
and this jukebox and what all it meant to me 
i would hate to see it go plain and simple says 
casagrande who has a group of customers who conduct impromptu 
singalongs with the help of the jukebox every friday night 
its not the money we make more on a couple of drinks than on 
the jukebox he says its just the fact that its part of the 
entertainment people come here with that in mind to hang around 
the jukebox 
mrs reutzel is also more than a source of music her contagious 
laughter and easygoing banter can shake the blues for many a lonely 
customer like the time she dedicated the song looking for love 
in all the wrong places to a downhearted patron who lost his 
girlfriend to another man and wanted to hear your cheating 
heart a dozen times 
were psychiatrists psychologists girlfriends its not just 
a record its that oneonone conversation she says 
most people in bars are lonely theyre sitting there and 
nobodys talking to them so they go up and they put a buck in the 
jukebox and turn around and say what do you want to hear 
everybody looks and says hey baby ill take this its a way 
of making friends because music is a common denominator 
music is also a way to reminisce through that special song that 
tugs at romantics hearts or makes an old man tap his toes 
how many people can be instantly gratified for whatever moment 
they want mrs reutzel asks when you have over 100000 
selections you can reach everyone 
mrs reutzel doesnt profess to having favorites but there is 
one tune that breathes life into the distant past when the 
requests slow down and shes feeling nostalgic she plays a song 
her father recorded decades ago as a member of the steel city four 
a barbershop quartet 
its a special song for many reasons mrs reutzel was raised by 
her mother but always longed to be closer to her father and 
hearing his voice among the thousands of records he collected over 
the years helps keep the bonds alive 
i was only in my dads life for holidays she explains while 
positioning the record on the turntable that hunger was always 
there to be with my dad and when i finally got here hes dead 
the record is scratchy and worn and its hard to make out all 
the words or hear each voice but its pure music to mrs reutzel 
do you hear it she says her face lighting up thats my 
dad thats him

editors note they called him the brown condor of 
ethiopia a black man from mississippi who broke down the color 
barrier in aviation circles back in the 1930s the littleknown 
adventures of john c robinson became an obsession with a fellow 
pilot who spent 10 years researching a book about his life 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
tom simmonss love of flying is fundamental he 
learned to fly at 16 owns a biplane flies at air shows 
most people who love the sky cant be as happy on the ground 
as other people he says as if stating an obvious truth 
but even he did not suspect that simple curiosity about a fellow 
pilot long dead could turn into an obsession that would consume his 
life for 10 years until he could search out and write down every 
detail he could discover about a remarkable american named john 
charles robinson 
the man became important to me says simmons 
he was from my hometown gulfport from my mississippi from 
my south and he belongs to the united states as a true hero i 
wanted everyone to know about him 
i once told someone that when i finally finished the book and 
had gotten it published maybe his spirit would leave me alone 
simmonss book the brown condor the true adventures of john 
c robinson was published recently by bartleby press whether 
john robinsons spirit now lets him go remains to be seen simmons 
still does not seem to tire of talking about robinson or about how 
he managed to find all that rich detail about his extraordinary 
life 
it turns out that john robinson against improbable odds not 
only became an accomplished pilot and instructor in the 1920s but 
also trained a small cadre of pilots for ethiopia when that country 
was invaded by italy as a prelude to world war ii he became 
emperor haile selassies personal pilot and consultant and later 
helped establish an ethiopian airline 
a small item in the 75th anniversary edition of the biloxi 
miss sunherald was what set tom simmons on his 10year quest 
it was a line from an old 1930s book a wpa book called a 
walking tour of gulfport and it said 
if you cross the gulf and ship island railroad you will come 
to the big quarter and at 30th avenue see the home of the pilot 
johnny robinson the brown condor of ethiopia 
simmons a native of gulfport knew its history knew the big 
quarter was the old black section of west gulfport he also knew 
his aviation history 
i said to myself are they trying to tell me a black man from 
gulfport could get a pilots license back in those days 
impossible aviation was one area where blacks were thoroughly 
excluded that was just a fact 
but if it were true i figured i might have a little article 
for one of the flying magazines i contributed to 
he knew an elderly woman miomi godine who was black and also a 
gulfport native he asked her if she had ever heard of john 
robinson 
she said why yes i knew him he used to walk me to sunday 
school she also told me that yes he had been a pilot had died 
as a result of an accident on a rescue mission in ethiopia in 1954 
and that his sister lived in new york city mrs bertha stokes 
mrs godines memory was clear and her recollections stirred 
simmonss curiosity all the more it was worth a trip to new york 
to confirm the improbability of what he was hearing 
it was after his visit with mrs stokes that curiosity became 
obsession 
back in mississippi simmons installed himself in the sunherald 
library and read every page of every paper from most of 1934 
through 1936 it produced a few incidents leads 
he found old clippings at tuskegee institute in alabama where 
robinson had learned automotive mechanics in 1924 
he found robinsons footprints in chicago where he had landed a 
job at a curtiswright flying school sweeping out classrooms while 
class was in progress and listening and where robinson and 
another black mechanic cornelius coffey had built their own 
airplane using a motorcycle engine 
he found cornelius coffey 
he found a photo of robinson at the air and space museum in 
washington but they knew nothing more about him on that trip 
though simmons met curtis graves 
curtis worked for nasa he grew up in mississippi and being 
black he was able to interview people who might have been leery 
about my motives pretty soon curtis was caught up in the project 
as much as i was 
the search for john robinson apparently had that effect on 
everyone snagged in simmonss net 
every time i thought well this is all im going to get he 
says another door would open which in turn led to another door 
and so on 
once announcing an air show in meridian miss in honor of 
pioneering pilot al key simmons turned to the honoree and said 
by the way al did you ever hear of a john robinson back in the 
old days 
key became a wellspring of anecdotes about robinson so it went 
it was easy to become fascinated by robinson especially for a 
southerner especially for black southerners they knew how the 
system worked back then and what it took to lick it as robinson 
had 
it was purely because of robinsons accomplishments that 
tuskegee was included in the armys program to train pilots for 
world war ii black pilots he knocked down that barrier 
i suppose i grew to love the man in the sense that even 
though im white i could identify with some of the struggles he 
went through i understood his having to go to another continent to 
get his opportunity to excel 
not long ago fred gregory a space shuttle pilot who is black 
visited mississippi simmons met him and gave him a ride in a 
biplane something the astronaut had never flown in 
the trail in aviation leads from john robinson to fred 
gregory john robinson was the spark 
i guess i got caught up in that notion and couldnt let it 
go

editors note change seems to be the rule in our fluid mobile 
society but stepping from one way of life into another seems to 
follow an unchanging pattern distinct phases whether the actual 
departure is abrupt or not and role exit as one scholar calls 
it is seldom easy 
</TEXT>

whether youve become an exwife exjunkie 
exsurgeon exhooker or exnun you go through the same 
psychological process in moving from one role to another according 
to a texas sociologist herself an exnun now married and the 
mother of two 
dr helen rose fuchs ebaugh sister helen rose for 11 years has 
called this process role exit and her dream is not that her 
book becoming an ex becomes a best seller but that the 
concept of role exit finds its way into introductory psychology 
texts 
she says she did not coin the phrase but she was the first to 
research it through interviews with 185 persons and discover the 
similarities and the stages people go through as they leave one 
role in life and move to another 
her own role exit was a happy one 
i thoroughly enjoyed my life as a nun she says i grew up 
in a small catholic german community in olfen texas where at 18 
women had the choice of getting married or joining the convent the 
nuns were unwitting feminists back then in that they were the only 
educated role models we had she says education was important 
to me 
she taught the fourth grade and later at our lady of the lake 
university in san antonio while she worked on her masters degree 
at the university of texas she then went to columbia university to 
win her doctorate it was then that she began the first stage of 
role exit the doubting she wondered whether the religious life 
was for her she felt a strong desire to be married and have 
children 
she soon met her husbandtobe a psychiatrist who was going 
through a divorce and a doctor friend was wrestling with whether 
he really wanted to be a doctor 
she noticed that all three of them were experiencing similar 
emotions as they moved from one role to another her research 
verified that the similarities are strong even when the exit is 
traumatic even when a mother chooses to give up custody of her 
children in order to get out of a terrible marriage 
ebaugh also realized that in todays society with a high 
divorce rate high mobility and second careers role exiting had a 
much broader reach than it did back when marriages were for life 
and people usually retired with a gold watch in the city in which 
they were born 
after the first doubts where people may become frustrated 
burned out or just realize their unhappiness comes what she calls 
the unconscious cueing stage a prostitute she interviewed allowed 
herself to get pregnant and then left her business because she did 
not wish her child to suffer the stigma of a mother in the worlds 
oldest profession 
a young mental health worker whose cadillac kept breaking down 
replaced it with a truck he explained it was for hauling dogs and 
camping he owned no dogs and did not camp in retrospect he says 
that he always thought he might want to go into the construction 
business which he eventually did 
in the convent subconscious cueing was often spotted in 
hairstyles those nuns who allowed their hair to grow longer and 
styled it more fashionably were those getting ready to role exit 
in the second stage people seek alternatives sometimes 
tangibly and sometimes in their imaginations married people may 
agree to a temporary separation business people may take a leave 
of absence 
third is the action stage the departure ebaugh found that 20 
percent of the exiters went through a gradual evolutionary 
process the vast majority experienced an identifiable turning 
point 
sometimes it was emotional as a spouses overwhelming feeling 
that ending the marriage at once was the only way to preserve 
sanity a protestant minister discontended with life in a fish 
bowl hearing criticism if he had a social cocktail and also if he 
didnt decided to look for other work after hearing a woman 
describe him as unprofessional 
a cia employee whose job entailed much travel resigned when his 
wife left him deciding he needed to stay at home to raise his son 
properly 
but there are many people ebaugh says for whom that critical 
event doesnt occur and who remain entrapped in roles they dont 
like 
the fourth stage is creating a new identity 
it is important to incorporate your old role into your new 
identity says ebaugh and to keep a few mementos or 
photographs eventually even if it was a traumatic exit it is 
good to have these things to look at when they are not so 
emotioncharged 
it is important to maintain contact with some people in the 
old role to keep some bridges she says you dont want to 
totally close the door to the past because a hangover identity 
will be there its also important to be able to talk to someone 
about who one used to be 
many of the interviewees reported the worst part was a sense of 
being in a vacuum when they switched roles divorcees for 
instance werent married but didnt quite feel single 
mothers who gave up custody had the hardest time 
most of these women were unable to support themselves much 
less their children at the time of the divorce and so they gave up 
custody for the sake of the children she says 
then after a few years when the woman has put her life back 
together either through remarriage or work they find they can 
support the children and try and get them back 
judges dont usually reverse custody says ebaugh and 
these women are still mothers but without their children 
ebaugh also writes about the problems of disclosing the past 
particularly when the role exit was positive such as becoming an 
exconvict or a recovering alcoholic the problem is that the label 
may persist 
dr ebaugh limited her research to people who made voluntary 
exits not people who suddenly lost jobs 
i suspect they go through the same stages but the timing is 
probably different she says 
recently ebaugh now 46 attended what would have been her 25th 
anniversary had she stayed in the convent 
it was a wonderful kind of closure for me she says i 
also realized it was a wonderful experience

editors note is a child who is hard of hearing more likely to 
become a criminal later in life studies in the nations prisons 
suggest there is a link thomas crowe of the university of 
mississippi is one researcher who believes that dealing with 
hearing disorders in young children may help reduce crime 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
noting an unusually high percentage of 
prisoners who are hard of hearing almost half in mississippi 
some researchers suspect the disorder may contribute to criminal 
behavior 
my working hypothesis is that hearing loss may be the first 
link in a chain of events or circumstances that eventually lead to 
a life of crime says thomas crowe chairman of the university of 
mississippi department of communicative disorders 
crowe found that 485 percent of the inmates at the mississippi 
state penitentiary at parchman suffer some kind of hearing disorder 
compared with only 7 percent among the general public the 
statistics are even more startling because the 7 percent represents 
the entire general population from infants to the elderly however 
the average age of the prison population is 25 and the younger age 
group should have a lower percentage of hearing disorders 
other researchers have had similar findings an ohio state 
penitentiary study in 1970 indicated 40 percent of the inmates had 
hearing disorders a 1986 study in wisconsin cited 36 percent and a 
1979 study in virginia 17 percent 
the ultimate question crowe says is what impact has the 
hearing loss had on that persons life has that hearing loss in 
any way contributed directly or indirectly to the persons 
criminal behavior and how do you determine that 
crowes research team which includes an audiologist 
psychologist psychiatrist medical doctor and linguist is now 
applying to the us justice department for a grant for a 
fiveyear followup study 
the second study will determine the severity nature and causes 
of inmates hearing disorders he said the amount of the request 
has yet to be worked out 
corrections officials as well as audiologists and speech 
pathologists nationwide are concerned about the high level of 
hearing disorders among prison populations says jo williams 
manager of audiology and technical assistance for the american 
speechlanguagehearing association in rockville md the 
56000member organization is the largest association of 
audiologists and speech and language pathologists in the nation 
the association called for more research in the field after a 
task forces cursory look at the problem in 1984 
the task force cited a nationwide survey of about 200 state and 
federal corrections administrators which indicated 77 percent of 
those polled believe the psychological and communication problems 
stemming from hearing disorders lead to criminal behavior 
crowe says he has found only a few dozen studies conducted in 
the past 40 years on any aspect of prisoners hearing and speech 
disorders of the few studies available he says almost all have 
merely documented the prevalence of problems 
if the hearing disorder is congenital or occurred early in the 
inmates life crowe says its likely the handicap helped shape a 
criminal personality 
crowes initial research in 1985 didnt indicate the exact 
nature severity or causes of the hearing disorders because there 
wasnt enough money for detailed hearing tests or medical 
evaluations 
the initial study involved merely testing each parchman inmates 
hearing at different frequencies and comparing that to a normal 
persons hearing range 
crowe compares the initial auditory screening test to a simple 
eye chart used by an opthalmologist the doctor knows the patient 
cant see the letters at a certain size but more tests are needed 
for a diagnosis of the problem 
there could be many causes for the hearing disorders crowe 
says including heredity and loud noises as well as lack of medical 
attention to ear infections or other problems in childhood 
even relatively minor hearing losses could damage a childs 
personality development crowe says many children with undetected 
hearing disorders grow up without ever knowing theyre physically 
different from their peers however they must deal with 
considerably more stress and disorientation 
it may sound like mumbling crowe says it would be like 
you trying to interact with someone with a very heavy foreign 
accent if you have to listen to them for a long time it will tire 
you out you have to channel and focus your attention to 
comprehend 
the strain may make the child irritable and he may appear to 
have an extremely short attention span 
some children with undetected hearing losses may grow up able to 
capture words but the emotions attached to the words escape them 
crowe says 
consider a preschool child who has a hearing loss not a real 
terrible hearing loss the child learns to talk but it is severe 
enough that the child has trouble hearing the meaning of things 
crowe says 
not only do you hear what is said but you hear how its said 
you hear inflections things like that you can read my moods and 
emotions 
an inability to follow the emotional trains of thought of others 
could trigger all kinds of antisocial tendencies crowe says add 
the emotional and intellectual handicaps from a hearing disorder to 
the underprivileged status of many children and you get a prime 
candidate for prison he says 
if that scenario is sometimes correct theoretically we can 
sometimes prevent crime by dealing with hearing problems and 
language problems at a preschool age he says 
some preschool programs such as head start do some hearing 
screening but many children dont have hearing tests until 
kindergarten or much later after personality traits are long 
entrenched 
i didnt have my first hearing test until i got back from 
vietnam crowe says

some on the wayne state campus arent happy with the centers 
view of the world and its advocacy of what they see as a 
particular political position 
at the time the center was founded it attracted a number of 
the liberal and leftliberal faculty members says retired 
geography professor fred dohrs said 
what the center has had ever since is a strong liberal bias 
said dohrs who led a failed effort in the late 1970s to block 
creation of a peace studies comajor for undergraduates at wayne 
state the centers political bias he says has made it a 
miserable failure in pursuing open academic inquiry 
there obviously is a good deal of suspicion here and elsewhere 
about the existence of peace and conflict studies centers says 
professor melvin small a historian and adviser to students in the 
comajor program 
small is author of johnson nixon and the doves a study of 
the effects of the antiwar movement on presidential decisions in 
vietnam 
while faculty members political views influence the topics they 
choose to study or teach they strive for fairness and objectivity 
in their classes and writings he says 
former ohio gov john gilligan director of notre dame 
universitys institute for international peace studies says 
political leaders never will be able to move toward reducing world 
tensions unless universities serve as open forums for all possible 
alternatives 
gilligan a law professor said his center was founded in 
response to the us roman catholic bishops 1985 pastoral letter 
on war and peace 
two 6 million grants from joan kroc widow of mcdonalds corp 
founder ray kroc have put notre dames center at the forefront of 
peace studies programs nationwide 
were up against some really hard facts of life gilligan 
says its extremely important that the educational 
establishment all the way down to the kindergarten level through 
graduate school get into it 
were drifting toward calamity

carroll oconnor is quick to point out that 
much has changed in the south since the filming of the 1967 movie 
in the heat of the night starring rod steiger and sidney 
poitier 
in the new nbc series based on the movie oconnor stars as bill 
gillespie police chief of the small mississippi town of sparta 
the role which earned steiger an academy award as best actor on 
tv howard rollins costars as virgil tibbs whose appointment as 
spartas black chief of detectives causes a stir in the deep south 
town 
im playing this different from rod says oconnor the man 
best remembered as archie bunker in all in the family rod 
played it as southern police chiefs were in 1967 he deserved his 
oscar remember the news pictures coming out of the south at that 
time with the dogs and the fire hoses but this is 1988 a lot has 
happened in the south since then the old attitude no longer works 
so the chief is fundamentally still the same but he knows he 
has to make accommodations its against the law to discriminate 
against black people and bill gillespie is going to make sure the 
law is obeyed hes a man in conflict he learned racism at his 
mothers knee but he lives by the law and he respects the law 
oconnor is holding court at a table designated by a brass 
plaque as carrolls corner in the ginger man the beverly 
hills restaurant he has owned for the past 11 years in partnership 
with actor patrick oneal theres a telephone nearby and people 
stop by to speak to him some wave from the sidewalk outside 
hes wearing a lightcolored summer suit and a bow tie his hair 
is snow white and his eyes behind his glasses are a piercing 
blue he picks up a pipe and lights up before continuing 
in the future were not going to concentrate so much on the 
crime you can find that on every police show we want to show what 
crime does to the community and what it does to the policemen and 
how two men from very different backgrounds feel about it the 
white police chief and the black detective have fundamental 
differences they have different sentiments and although crime 
affects them in different ways they can work together 
i think that eluded us in the first outing but i think well 
get it this time people will say its right on which is what they 
said about all in the family 
the first season of the show was filmed entirely on location in 
hammond la but there is talk that the company may go to northern 
california for the fall season to save money 
oconnor says he found the people of hammond cooperative and the 
city seemed to him to be fully integrated nancy and their son 
hugh joined him there hugh also works in his fathers restaurant 
he says that when he completed all in the family in 1983 he 
wasnt looking for a new series 
i wanted to go to new york and do another play he says i 
did one called brothers and it was a miserable flop then i did 
another homefront and it was a flop but not a miserable flop 
both plays appealed to the audience but if you dont get the critic 
for the new york times your show folds what you do is end up 
putting on a play for just one man 
he also starred in a cbs movie called brass in which he 
played the chief of detectives in new york city he says it was not 
a pilot but concedes that any tv movie with a star is a de facto 
pilot he also starred in the nbc movie the father clements 
story 
i didnt do any pilots he says although we talked about 
some i was all set to do a show with abc i was going to be a kind 
of oldtime oss or cia man whos put in charge of a russian 
defector we were to have various adventures together but they 
gave me a producer whod had five flops in a row i said no and 
they gave me a month to find someone wed all be satisfied with i 
suggested a couple of guys that was the last i ever heard from 
them 
oconnor is surprised at how fast his latest series came 
together 
his first series all in the family bounced from network to 
network and went through several pilots before cbs finally put it 
on the air in january 1971 it lasted for 12 years 
this time he says i got a call from freddie silverman and he 
asked me to meet him silverman was head of programming at cbs 
when all in the family went on the air he later became 
president of abc entertainment then nbc and currently is a 
successful independent producer his other shows include nbcs 
matlock jake and the fatman now on standby at cbs and 
the perry mason movie series 
we met right here at this table says oconnor he said 
nbc is ready to do it if youll do it theyll do it ive had a 
lot of people talk to me about series it usually takes years 
talk talk talk so here is a producer who can put a deal together 
in two weeks

ask joan rivers why she took a chance on 
broadway and the answer comes back in her familiar rapidfire 
delivery 
are you kidding she machineguns its the best womans 
role written in the last five years besides i wanted to see if i 
could do it at this stage in my life 
could the queen of 23 years of standup comedy the woman who 
coined the phrase can we talk its now a federally registered 
trademark and a battlescarred veteran of the television talkshow 
wars become a plain worldweary middleclass brooklyn housewife 
whose marriage and life are falling apart 
she could and she did earning cheers from audiences and 
respect from the critics 
the role is the centerpiece of neil simons 1940s 
autobiographical play broadway bound linda lavin won a tony 
award when she first did it in new york nearly two years ago but 
rivers has made the role her own her contract with the play 
originally for four weeks has been extended and there is talk she 
may star in the london production when it opens next year 
rivers success caps a turbulent and tragic year that began in 
may 1987 when she was unceremoniously dumped from fox 
broadcastings latenight talk show after only seven months on the 
air three months later her husband edgar rosenberg died from an 
overdose of valium 
rivers was determined to get back to work broadway bound 
has been an effective tonic 
its the first good experience since my husband died and the 
fox firing she says simply its been a very positive thing 
rivers sits on a couch in her madison avenue hotel suite and 
works on a needlepoint sampler spike her tiny mop of a dog sits 
at her feet and chews contentedly on a bright pink slipper 
one of the reasons i wanted to do the play was that nobody in 
california thinks of me as an actress rivers says between 
stitches they would think of me only as talkshow hostess or a 
standup comic 
thats a tough reality to face particularly for someone who 
says the first thought about what i was going to do with my life 
was that i was going to be an actress from infancy on no question 
about it 
simon and gene saks the original director of broadway bound 
who came back to the show to help her offered strong support 
simon said we dont want a stunt and joan doesnt want it to 
be a stunt she recalls i came in read and they offered me 
the part right there 
ive been acting for a lot longer than people realize youre 
acting every minute when you do a standup i knew it was still in 
me timing inflection theres so much to watch when you are 
building a character how she walks how she stands how she 
reacts 
the role of kate jerome is not rivers first venture on 
broadway she appeared in new york in 1971 in fun city a play 
she cowrote with her husband 
its a joy to see my name on the marquee rivers says 
thats when i say wheres my mother wheres my husband 
it was rosenberg who guided rivers career the one person who 
knew immediately when something wasnt working on stage or in a 
club 
he would have told me do this differently or do that 
differently she says i miss that part of it so much he was 
a brilliant editor and i had respect for him

how does an adult reviewer approach a movie such as big top 
peewee very carefully 
if you lambaste it as an entertainment aimed at the 5yearold 
audience you might be accurate but you could also be accused of 
being a killjoy and a fogy if you try to compare it with the 
innocent comedy of the silent screen you might also score some 
points but you could also be accused of hunting for gold in a pile 
of dross 
so here goes 
big top peewee is a clever piece of pure entertainment 
conceived by paul reubens and executed by peewee herman who are 
the same person those who loved peewees big adventure will 
adore this one 
the story begins with peewee waking up on the most antiseptic 
farm in the world everything is sunny and bright matching 
peewees personality the animals sleep on mattresss and eat 
flapjacks at a picnic table peewees greenhouse is a wonder with 
his magic food supplements he can grow anything even hot dogs 
peewees constant companion is vance a purewhite pig vance 
talks with a charity seldom seen in comedians peewee gives vance 
most of the punchlines but then how are you going to upstage a 
talking pig 
every day peewee is scheduled for a sandwich lunch with his 
heartthrob the local schoolmarm penelope ann miller for such a 
shy man peewee can be aggressive he throws his body on top of 
the schoolmarm who resists him because the schoolkids are 
watching and taking snapshots 
then the circus comes to the farm a new set of animals are 
roaming the acres as well as exotic circus people such as the 
italian aerialist valeria golino with whom peewee falls in 
love the townspeople object to having the circus in their midst 
providing a modicum of conflict to the script 
centerstage at all times is peewee herman a man with a squeaky 
voice tight suit and white socks he is in the end an endearing 
character guileless yet savvy he wears well despite the inane 
circumstances in which he finds himself 
kris kristofferson as the circus boss lends strength though his 
threeinch wife susan tyrell stretches fantasy too far randal 
kleiser directed in a straightforward fashion only one sequence is 
truly hilarious and that is borrowed from alfred hitchcock when 
peewee finally makes love with the aerialist we see a train 
entering a tunnel north by northwest and skyrockets exploding 
to catch a thief 
big top peewee was produced by reubens and debra hill and 
written by him and george mcgrath the rating is pg perhaps for 
sexual innuendo running time 87 minutes

temple of low men capitol crowded house 
 
crowded houses temple of low men may be the catchiest 
depressing album youll ever hear 
the new zealand trio behind neil finns sprightly paul 
mccartneylike melodies and some killer hooks became one of pop 
musics most gratifying success stories in 1987 with such hits as 
something so strong and dont dream its over 
but dont look for any silly love songs on the followup 
temple of low men finns a brooder worrying about everything 
from doomed relationships to his own success 
finn seems especially wary of love on this albums bookends i 
feel possessed describes a lovers spellbinding hold on him but 
the narrator is as much scared by the power as consumed by it and 
better be home soon addressed to an absent lover is more a 
threat than a plea 
on mansion in the slums finn tells everyone who covets his 
kind of success that its not worth it 
the taste of success only lasts you half an hour or less 
finn sings he declares that hed much rather have a trampoline 
than an isolation tank in an obvious jibe at the music businesss 
most tortured success michael jackson 
why bother listening to another rock star complaining his lifes 
a mess becauses the musics almost unerringly pretty better be 
home soon is the kind of lovely ballad mccartney used to be able 
to toss off in his sleep and the acoustic guitarbased tune will 
probably benefit commercially from the current singersongwriter 
boom 
never be the same and i feel possessed are also 
particularly strong theres nothing as instantly accessible as the 
hits from the first album but temple of low men rewards 
repeated listening 
imagine what crowded house could do if neil finn were happy

in a community where survivor is an 
overworked word liza minnelli wears the designation with honor 
she has been through it all growing up in the shadow of a 
tempestuous mother judy garland dancing on the stage of new 
yorks hallowed palace theater at 7 while her mother sang 
swanee dropping out of high school for the sake of show 
business watching her mother fall into the deadly spiral of booze 
and drugs 
there were triumphs as well she won a tony award in 1965 for 
flora the red menace on television her liza with a z 
brought a coveted emmy in 1973 and in films she won an academy 
award for best actress for her portrayal of sally bowles in 
cabaret 
there also were two broken marriages to entertainer peter allen 
and actorproducer jack haley jr and an addiction to alcohol and 
drugs that resulted in treatment at the betty ford center in rancho 
mirage calif in 1984 
but shes here and thriving more than ever with concerts tv 
specials and a tour with frank sinatra and sammy davis jr subbing 
for the ailing dean martin 
minnelli is also back in movies her return after a lapse of a 
few years was inauspicious the shortlived rentacop with 
burt reynolds she is starring again with dudley moore in arthur 
2 on the rocks which is having a rough time recapturing the 
gaiety of 1981s original comedy hit 
the actress said she had no apprehension about making the sequel 
because the way i found out about it was great dudley called 
were very good friends and he said i want you to read 
something im not going to tell you what it is just read it and 
call me back 
when i opened the package and read arthur on the rocks i 
said oh wait a minute is this a good idea then i read it and 
i really enjoyed it i thought it was a wonderful script 
at first i was worried because the writer and director of the 
first film was steve gordon and he died much to all of our sorrow 
i didnt think anyone could recapture those characters but i think 
andy breckman did a wonderful job he seemed to have so much 
affection for the original movie that he caught all the 
characters 
in arthur 2 moore again portrays a prankplaying 
multimillionaire who is seldom without a drink in his hand makes 
you wonder why his wife minnelli sticks with him 
she loves him minnelli said hes her husband and shell 
do anything to defend him and dont anyone say anything bad about 
him thats the kind of woman she is 
did you ever see the thin man series i went back and looked 
at them i learned a lot from myrna loy and the way she portrayed 
the wife of william powell she was completely supportive and 
they had fun together she was interested in everything her husband 
did thats how i tried to play linda 
of course some day arthur has to grow up thats why she 
leaves him sometimes it takes that kind of a shock in peoples 
lives to make them change 
some critics have complained that moores boozing is no longer 
funny in this era of alcoholism awareness 
minnelli had this response we think back on wc fields and 
wonderful actors who have played classic american drunks i think 
dudley created an entirely new character in arthur hes so sweet 
and he tries to be good 
the daughter of judy garland and director vincente minnelli 
liza grew up famous but unlike some other hollywood children she 
has managed to build a successful career and personal life she is 
married to artist mark gero 
i grew up with a lot of love and support from my family she 
said my family understood this town for what is was a working 
town an industry town instead of mining it happens to be movies 
my folks were levelheaded they instilled what i think are very 
proper values 
but you can only learn so much and then youre on your own 
you have to either take responsibility for your own life or keep 
running it off onto your problems and on to chemicals or alcohol 
its real easy to do and its understandable 
when you realize that youre dependent on anything but the 
human spirit you get depressed with any kind of good help you 
can get back on track you just can

minimalist composer philip glass says his 
astonishing success in opera over the past decade heralds a return 
to the spirit of the 1960s 
i think idealism is something that is becoming acceptable 
again if i can put it that way after a decade of materialism 
he said 
the idealism of the 60s i believe that were coming back to 
that he said i think that young people are not all going to 
be stockbrokers and lawyers 
i think theres a reaction setting in against that kind of 
materialism and lack of idealism and in a way i think thats why 
were getting good audiences for these pieces 
glass is probably the leading contemporary opera composer of 
the day said rheinhard g pauly a music professor and opera 
historian at lewis amp clark college in portland ore 
he is one of the few contemporary opera composers who has 
really developed a strong following its unusual for contemporary 
opera to be really successful 
casting simple themes in shimmering repetition and gradual 
change that fans find entrancing and detractors find stupefying 
glass also has won acclaim in film theater dance and other 
musical modes 
in recent years the 51yearold baltimore native has 
collaborated with singer linda ronstadt songwriters paul simon and 
suzanne vega dance choreographer twyla tharp and stage 
directordesigner robert wilson 
his recent film scores include koyanisqatsi mishima and 
the recently released powaqqatsi 
glass was 39 when his first opera einstein on the beach 
was performed at the avignon festival in france in 1976 
his second satyagraha an account of mahatma gandhis 
development of the tactic of passive resistance as a young lawyer 
in south africa was commissioned by the netherlands opera and 
performed in rotterdam in 1980 
akhnaten based on an ancient egyptian pharaoh and first 
performed in stuttgart germany in 1984 completed a trilogy on 
historical figures who changed the world through the power of 
their ideas glass said 
all have been sellouts in us performances and have been 
recorded on the cbs masterworks label 
philip glass operas always sell well said speight jenkins 
general director of the seattle opera 
i have found it satyagraha to be the most satisfying of 
the works jenkins said i think philip glass may be writing 
better music now but i also think i have never heard a better text 
with one of his operas 
in a recent interview during a visit to promote the seattle 
opera production of satyagraha in july glass said gandhis 
stark idealism is one of the reasons why i think younger 
people are very drawn to this work i think younger people tend to 
be more idealistic than the older folks 
gandhi was a man who was an idealist to the end of his days 
he proved that idealism isnt something you outgrow you dont 
have to it can be something you can carry with you all your life 
that in itself is an inspiration 
the stuttgart opera has scheduled performances of einstein 
satyagraha and akhnaten on successive nights in 1990 
i think of einstein as being the modern kind of 
psychokinetic opera the one thats amplified and full of energy 
glass said it kind of goes with the idea of nuclear energy and 
progressive ideas in science right 
i think of satyagraha as the lyrical opera which is all 
flowing melodic lines and choruses theres something very gentle 
about satyagraha its a lyrical opera 
i think of akhnaten as the tragic opera of the three a very 
dark one the one that at a certain moment you realize no one 
gets out of here alive his fourth opera the making of the 
representative from planet 8 with a libretto by doris lessing 
premiered in houston on july 8 performances are scheduled later 
this year in england and the netherlands in the script 
civilization on another planet is threatened by an ice age 
his next the palace of the arabian nights is set for a 
premiere next year in france and is based loosely on the stories 
of the stories of the arabian nights glass said 
last march the metropolitan opera gave him a commission for 
the voyage a threepart allegory based on the exploration of 
christopher columbus the premiere is set for october 1992 the 
500th anniversary of the sailing of the pinta nina and santa maria 
in america 
opera is the medium of choice for me the one in which the 
composer plays a primary function glass said 
the theater is the directors house the ballet is the 
choreographers house the opera is the composers house he 
said i like that 
from commissioning to staging typically takes three years he 
said 
it takes a year to plan it a year to write it and a year to 
build it he said you spend a lot of time involved with your 
subject so i am very careful about my subject matter they do 
become part of your life

the latest work by american minimalist 
composer philip glass and tony awardwinning playwright david henry 
hwang billed as a science fiction musical drama has premiered in 
vienna hallowed home of classical opera to mixed reviews 
the 90minute piece 1000 airplanes on the roof opened 
before an invited audience of some 500 people july 19 in the 
unusual setting of a hangar at viennas schwechat airport 
the occasional shudder of a jet landing or the rising crescendo 
of a takeoff punctuated the repetitive rhythms and melodies used by 
glass in his technically impressive score for soprano voice 
synthesizers flute piccolo and alto and soprano sax 
1000 airplanes on the roof tells the story of m a copy 
shop worker in new york city who disappears for four days for an 
encounter with the supernatural m realizes that he has had many 
such meetings before in his life but the difference this time is 
that he remembers what he saw 
when he returns to his workplace disheveled and tired m is 
immediately taken to a psychiatrist realizing that he should bend 
to the conventions of a threedimensional world he denies belief 
in what he knows that there is a fourth and fifth dimension and 
higher intelligence out in space 
hwang whose m butterfly won the tony for best play of 1988 
on broadway said the text is intended to show the tricks memory 
plays on human beings and how humans suppress unpleasant 
recollections in order to preserve a chosen identity 
reviewers for austrias two biggestcirculation newspapers 
opined however that hwang fell short of his highminded target 
praising instead the intricate and attractive stage design of 
jerome sirlin 
this is a remarkable science fiction tale for which david 
henry hwang concocted a tale full of banal presumptions wrote 
karlheinz roeschitz in sunday editions of the neue kronen zeitung 
the kafkaesque critical message that philip glass and his 
scriptwriter david henry hwang wanted to deliver just sinks in 
empty sciencefiction phrases wrote thomas dombrowski in kurier 
praising the technical perfection of glass composition 
dombrowski added that nonetheless this music of the hardworking 
glass remains just a pleasant background to the real work of art of 
this musical drama the projections of the designer and architect 
jerome sirlin 
sirlin who last year designed the set for madonnas worldwide 
whos that girl tour acknowledges borrowing heavily from 
rudolf svoboda the czech designer behind pragues famed laterna 
magika theater 
using svobodas technique of projecting slides on to a vast 
stage set sirlin creates a constantly changing web of images 
reflecting ms real and imagined surroundings 
rocco sisto as m is on stage constantly adding depth to 
sirlins sets with wellacted mime but struggling occasionally to 
get across the meaning of lengthy englishlanguage monologues to a 
germanspeaking audience 
jointly sponsored by festivals in austria berlin and 
philadelphia 1000 airplanes on the roof cost the organizers 
of the danube festival held for the first time this year in the 
province of lower austria adjoining urban vienna about 375000 
the trio whose work moves to berlin and then philadelphia at 
the start of a 26city tour said they first thought of the idea of 
a science fiction drama about 18 months ago 
the bizarre title of the work emerged from what glass said was a 
story he was told separately by three people in brooklyn ny san 
antonio texas and geneva switzerland 
each reported what felt like an encounter with the supernatural 
that ended with a crushing noise above their heads glass said 
they described the sound as like 100 airplanes on the roof 
said the composer adding i just made that 1000 airplanes 
and do the authors themselves believe in close encounters of an 
unnatural kind 
when we started working sitting in philips living room i 
kind of reluctantly volunteered a story from when i was 10 years 
old and i saw a ufo replied sirlin 
after a while he recalled glass admitted seeing an 
unidentified flying object once too 
with david we both figured he had probably seen one too or 
had some experience that hes still not ready to talk about 
sirlin said 
hwang quick to seize on his theme of selective memory chuckled 
in reply i forgot

for the first time in his solo career robert 
plant who sang lead in led zeppelin for two decades pays a 
musical salute to the group that ended its reign in rock n roll 
when drummer john bonzo bonham died after a european tour in 
1980 
on his latest lp now and zen plant has lifted guitar 
riffs bridges and musical phrases the group once used in their hot 
tunes and inserted them into his new work at the end of white 
clean and neat plant sings a bit of since ive been loving 
you a hit for led zeppelin in 1970 on stage he puts some of 
zeps custard pie from the physical graffiti lp on the end 
of tall cool one 
zeppelin guitarist jimmy page also plays on plants first 
single heaven knows and tall cool one the current 
single plant cowrote and sang the only one on outrider 
the new album page has after years of semiretirment 
im tipping my hat looking back plant said in an 
interview ive had kind of a mental block on that whole period 
now i have no problem with it at all i think it was crucial to 
distance myself just for my own integrity i didnt know it was 
going to happen like this i thought i would forever be a little 
reluctant and reticent but i see now that its ok 
i think this solo record is about the nearest ive got to 
succeeding on nearly all levels this is the most commercial and 
attractive its the happiest record ive made probably in my 
life 
most of the musical references to led zeppelin are on the 
fadeouts of tracks and theyre done by a synthesizer briefly 
recreating the zeppelin music plant said now is a good time to 
have a record out because theres a renewed interest in led 
zeppelin 
i think the time seems to be appropriate right now he said 
thats all right by me my father always tells me be thankful 
for all mercies plants father was a civil engineer in 
bromwich staffordshire england where he was born almost 40 years 
ago 
its an interest in the music of the 70s but we were from 
the 60s plant said its sad really because i thought 
somebody could have come up with something else by now 
there are other things around but there is also a lot of the 
led zeppelin thing about it would be nice to get something with 
that kind of intent that thing whatever it was that we had 
instead of all these impersonators trying to get somewhere near us 
and generally missing by a good mile 
on now and zen plant has new partners phil johnstone and 
dave barrett two young songwriters whose publisher sent plant a 
demo tape 
i think the whole thing is a lot fresher he said it has 
been a revival for me within myself never mind within the industry 
i just wanted to get songs then i could see what could happen 
next of all the 100 or 120 tapes that had been sent me i found 
this one little old baby cassette tape had got the very essence of 
what i wanted to do musically and what ive always felt that i 
represented musically 
there it was in its virgin splendor heaven knows with a 
girl singing it virgin publishing sent it it was sent by some 
astute lackey publishers boy who knew that this was what everybody 
else didnt know most publishers are hawking anything they can 
irrespective of whether its the right thing for the job 
it had some intrigue and some kind of mood that you dont get 
on a pop record generally you hear it sometimes on a kate bush or 
peter gabriel record plant said 
i arranged a meeting with johnstone and barrett they arrived 
late enough to be cool but not to be aggressive it was really good 
because they were arrogant and not impressed 
from that meeting the three of us got together in barretts 
bedroom set up the computers and started chattering our way 
through the first two songs that we wrote together barrett turned 
knobs and stuff while phil and myself wrote white clean and neat 
and tall cool one 
that was in december 1986 a band was assembled by march 1987 
final songs were written by the band and recording started in may 
plant launched a us tour in may i think its time to tour 
and tour and tour and tour and tour and play and celebrate this new 
thing and write the next album during the process of celebration 
the group goes to europe in september and might extend the tour 
to the orient and australia 
plant turns 40 on aug 20 and had these observations about his 
birthday theres no deterioration anywhere particularly a few 
visual marks a few fenders may need a little bit of adjustment 
here and there but the spirit and body and the man is doing fine 
so its of no consequence 
i know it sounds corny but basically im thrilled and im glad 
to be around

erich segal the brooklyn boy who went to harvard 
taught classics at yale and wrote love story is still juggling 
serious and popular writing in a leafy corner of london 
he looks back on love story as a youthful camelot and 
senses that with his latest novel doctors he may finally 
achieve the critical acclaim that has so far eluded him 
at 51 he has temporarily given up the rigors of fulltime 
university teaching but remains a fellow at oxford universitys 
wolfson college an occasional sports commentator he dreams of 
winning the over60 category in the 1997 boston marathon 
i am today a writer who is lucky enough to have academic 
privileges at oxford he says 
segals fifth and most ambitious novel doctors is the 
first that did not draw on his own life instead it chronicles 
members of the harvard medical school class of 1962 which included 
several of his friends 
he said he tried to tackle the subject of doctors and the 
pressures they face with the passion of love story his first 
novel and the scope of his last novel the class a 25year 
fictional followup of his fellow harvard graduates of 1958 
for a long while i lived in gossip columns as eric love 
story segal he said in an interview 
people would run up to me in airports and sing the first few 
bars of the tune from the movie version its not such a bad thing 
if it had stopped there i would have looked back on life as an 
athlete looks back and say i was there once 
instead he moved on to such works as the class and 
doctors which at 679 pages is five times the length of love 
story segal remarks publishers used to worry that my books 
were too short now theyre worrying that theyre too long 
he doesnt feel he is an expatriate american writer the 
academic world is the same everywhere he said and with satellite 
television and 168 fares to new york america is never far away 
in this day and age if i need something from the carnegie 
delicatessen theres always the concorde he said and it 
never gets that bad 
segals wife karen is english and when francesca their 
musically gifted 8yearold daughter started school he decided it 
was unfair to keep commuting between yale and oxford 
but he hates britains weather and hopes to spend winters in 
southern california and teach there when francesca becomes a 
teenager 
academics who have achieved popular success as writers include 
british philosopher iris murdoch american astronomer carl sagan 
and italys umberto eco a professor of semiotics 
i only hope some day ill reach the level of scholarship or 
literary respectability that theyve achieved segal said it 
gives me a goal to shoot for 
segal speaks nine languages and has written a book on roman 
comedy and more than 50 articles on greek tragedy latin poetry and 
ancient athletics but he has always found time to indulge his love 
of pop literature 
he wrote the harvard hasty pudding club show in 1958 and has 
written or cowritten several screenplays including the beatles 
yellow submarine in 1968 
love story his bittersweet tale of youthful love and death 
which has sold more than 20 million copies in 33 languages since 
publication in 1970 turned the unknown professor into an 
international celebrity the sequel olivers story a 1977 
best seller was followed by man woman and child 
although he was refused tenure at yale in 1971 some say 
jealous colleagues disdained his success segal kept teaching and 
writing in 1981 he returned to yale as a full professor though 
still without tenure and retired in 1987 
to critics who dismissed love story as fluff he replies 
eighteen years later when i find myself feeling guilty for all 
that success and thinking love story was overrated i pull out my 
encyclopedia britannica and see myself listed as writing in the 
tradition of the classic sentimental novelists and then my ego 
relights 
it was my little camelot and it cant be taken away it was my 
idyll 
but fortunately i got my second wind or second chance with 
the class i had exhausted the possibilities of the sentimental 
novel and i got into the saga business which has vastly more raw 
material 
the class a 1985 best seller was segals first novel to 
receive modest critical acclaim winning literary prizes in france 
and italy i actually thought the class was the end because 
id written my life story into it split apart he said 
he had qualms about writing doctors doubting his ability to 
enter their world he spent two years attending medical congresses 
talking to doctors and wandering through university college 
hospital in london weaing a white coat and a badge identifying him 
as dr segal 
it says in little letters professor of latin so i could 
walk the halls said segal who has a doctorate in comparative 
literature 
why doctors 
because theyre very special he said theyre the people 
we fear need love and hate the most and they are answerable 
so they think only to god 
he says he set out to write a diatribe against unscrupulous 
doctors but met so many dedicated ones that he had to stop himself 
from going the other way 
an insomniac segal normally works from 4 am to 5 pm without 
leaving his desk then the slightly built athlete who has 
completed over 40 marathons goes for a swim or a run 
segal says he is writing one more academic book a history of 
classical comedy but his next novel depends on what happens to 
doctors 
the first review in publishers weekly says the book addresses 
the gravest most pressing issues facing doctors today and is 
segals most skillfully written novel 
segal elated says that means i may be entering a phase of 
respectability which ive always dreamed of

songwriter mickey newbury says his 
career suffered because of two of his bestknown compositions 
american trilogy and just dropped in to see what condition 
my condition was in 
both songs the 48yearold writerperformer says boxed him 
into uncomfortable stereotypes either as a patriot or a rocker 
american trilogy was a hit by elvis presley in 1973 and 
just dropped in was recorded by kenny rogers and the first 
edition in 1968 
american trilogy a medley of dixie battle hymn of 
the republic and all my trials has been recorded or 
performed by dozens of artists 
it stopped me in my tracks for a few years newbury said in 
an interview the only thing i was getting asked to do was sing 
the national anthem at football games and i didnt like it 
i did bob hopes fourth of july show you get a tag and it 
stuck 
he says some people still come to his concerts to hear him 
perform it 
hopefully if i can get them in to see me because of that 
song theyll listen to something else ive done its the same 
problem everybody has for jerry reed and ray stevens audiences 
come in to hear their funny stuff but they have a serious side 
his reputation as a country music songwriter was undermined when 
just dropped in was taken as a song glorifying drug abuse 
i was not taken seriously as a country songwriter for a 
while he recalled it hurt me because of the insanity of the 
music business everyone wanted to put you in a little pigeonhole 
it was one of the first obvious antidrug songs yet it was so 
controversial that some said it was detrimental it was about a bad 
acid trip all the songs at that time were cloaked in metaphors 
espousing the glory of hallucinogens they talked about how 
wonderful it was and how they open up your mind it caused me to 
write it i knew it was not that way for everyone it put some 
people in the toilet 
newbury who now lives in vida ore has just released his 14th 
album mickey newbury in a new age 
its his first lp since 1981 and a kind of greatest hits album 
yes american trilogy is on the disc along with all my 
trials san francisco mabel joy and others 
during his career hes also written sweet memories a hit by 
andy williams and she even woke me up to say goodbye which 
has been recorded by dozens of performers joan baez and ray 
charles are just two of the other singers who have recorded his 
songs 
newbury describes a good song as a good story something 
someone can relate to a lot of songwriters get better as they get 
older but theyve already written about most of the interesting 
things in their life that happened when they were young and it was 
new 
the whole process that drives you to write is to write that 
perfect song no songwriter ever feels hes written that perfect 
song stephen foster did it already with beautiful dreamer and 
yet when he died he had a piece of paper in his pocket that said 
dear hearts and gentle people he had already started on another 
song 
i think don mcleans song vincent is a perfect song and i 
have not heard many perfect songs ones so finely crafted that you 
say i cant make a change

the walls of dr robert k grahams 
relatively ordinarylooking office are lined with the pictures of 
dozens of babies he says are far from ordinary the products of 
the socalled nobel prize sperm bank 
this is our pride and joy and by god every one is a gem 
said graham of the children born to mothers inseminated with 
superior sperm provided by his repository for germinal choice 
graham 81 a multimillionaire who developed the shatterproof 
eyeglass lens is on a mission to save the human species superior 
genes are being lost he says because societys smartest dont 
have enough children while the masses proliferate with zeal 
graham founded the bank in early 1980 and began collecting the 
sperm of a select few outstanding intellects and giving it to 
qualified couples with the goal of bringing into the world 
potential leaders or great scientists 
the bank claims responsibility for 55 babies and 18 women are 
pregnant 
graham says his program is working that most of the children 
develop at a much faster rate than their peers and are judged 
gifted geneticists however still find fault saying the program 
minimizes womens role in reproduction and exaggerates the 
likelihood children will inherit all their parents good genes 
but the proud parents cheer graham for bringing them bright 
children they deserved but couldnt have usually because the 
father was infertile 
i just wanted to have a child said adrienne ramm a dancer 
from new york city whose daughter leandra turned 4 on wednesday 
i believe that the donor sprem was from a man that seemed to be a 
great human being we were increasing our chances of having a 
bright and healthy child 
i cant imagine anyone would go there because they want a 
super baby said a riverside mother who asked that her name not 
be used its just the best choice available for those who choose 
artificial insemination 
when graham opened his repository critics ranging from 
feminists to communists and the roman catholic church denounced it 
as a master race plan reminiscent of adolf hitler the 
controversy was fueled by nobel prize winner william shockleys 
revelation that he was a donor and by grahams own views 
shockley a physicist who invented the junction transistor 
believed that certain races blacks for example were genetically 
disposed to be intellectually inferior 
graham in his book the future of man called man an 
evolutionary derelict because huge masses of those with 
ordinary minds have been allowed to come into being and then 
proliferate 
over time artificial insemination became common and more 
radical techniques like in vitro insemination and gene mapping 
took the spotlight in the reproductive industry to grahams 
delight protestors disappeared from outside his office about 30 
miles north of downtown san diego 
alexander capron a scholar at the university of southern 
california and former member of president reagans commission on 
bioethics has concerns with the repository but gratefully notes 
it hasnt become a major force in reproduction 
i continue to think of it as a rather silly misguided 
effort capron said the whole notion of individuality and of 
uniqueness is what amounts to a genetic accident 
the idea that youre going to get an olympian could lead to 
parents frustrations when expectations arent fulfilled 
capron also has ethical concerns what does it say about a 
mothers contribution in reproduction in it is the potential for a 
more eugenic society with somebody deciding what genes get passed 
along 
graham counters that he neither promises nor expects the 
children to reach their fathers levels of success or intellect 
but says 
we can with considerable assurance say we are contributing to 
the next generation by bringing a number of capable constructive 
individuals including leaders who wouldnt otherwise have been 
born or wouldnt be as bright 
the identities of donors described by graham as tops in their 
field and outstanding intellects are withheld from the 
parents and the public the list includes two nobelists and an 
olympian all are of european descent or jewish and most are 
california scientists graham says hes invited blacks and asians 
to donate but that theyve refused 
donors are declared of good health and genetic ancestry which 
means their families are free of such diseases as alcoholism and 
mental illness and the donated sperm is screened for the acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome virus part of the aids screening 
includes a 180day sperm quarantine 
the sperm stored in tanks of liquid nitrogen that keep it 
frozen has been sent around the country and as far away as egypt 
applicant parents must show they are married intelligent 
emotionally and financially stable with a clean physical and 
mental health history the mother must be under age 38 about half 
the applicants are rejected parents choose a donor from such 
information as intelligence test score ancestry hair and eye 
color athletic ability hobbies and personality traits 
when they had leandra adrienne and david ramm chose a 
fairhaired science professor of european roots described as loving 
gardening skiing and children for their second child due next 
month they chose the olympic athlete 
at first i did feel inadequate and weird about the idea of 
using a donor said ramm a computer systems manager who is 
infertile but adrienne really wanted a baby and that was fine by 
me the only tough part is that since leandra is so incredibly 
bright shes constantly exploring and challenging and into 
everything which can be exhausting 
but its the price you pay for having such a bright baby 
most sperm banks provide limited screening and dont allow 
parents to choose among donors and the repository parents say it 
is the thorough medical check and quality of donors that draw them 
not a desire for super children 
repository parents also acknowledge they promote their childs 
intellectual development and have high expectations but say they 
are not unreasonable 
i dont have flash cards around the crib since he was two 
weeks old but i do expose jeffrey to as much as i can the 
riverside mother said 
the 33yearold woman and her 45yearold second husband came to 
graham because the husband had a vasectomy in an earlier marriage 
between them they already had six other children from previous 
marriages 
although her other children are bright her two teenage girls 
are honor students she says 1yearold jeffrey is different he 
requires little sleep for his age only seven hours is extremely 
inquisitive and loves books 
her stories echo those of other repository parents several of 
whom have come back for a second child graham says the childrens 
vocabulary is often twice that expected theyre standing early 
and walking young 
graham requires annual reports from parents but is frustrated 
that his experiment lacks rigid scientific standards because the 
donors and parents vary and the children are raised in different 
environments but he added the general consequences of bright 
happy kids is good enough for me

the boys mother said he had cystic fibrosis 
and so did the lab tests but the real disease was far more bizarre 
and it lay within the mother 
no parent could have been more dedicated during the 5yearolds 
hospitalizations she stayed with him around the clock and often 
helped the nurses giving him medications 
but doctors eventually realized she also altered the boys 
stool and perspiration samples to make them consistent with cystic 
fibrosis 
she tried to cast doubt on a normal test result by calling the 
hospital laboratory giving a false name and claiming the result 
was phony and she tricked a real cystic fibrosis patient into 
giving her a sputum sample then submitted the sample to doctors as 
her sons 
her case is an elaborate example of a psychiatric disorder 
called munchausen syndrome by proxy a variant of munchausen 
syndrome in which a person fakes disease just to get medical care 
it is derived from baron von munchausen an 18th century german who 
became well known for elaborate lies 
in munchausen by proxy typically a mother produces disease or 
the appearance of disease in her child then acts like the model of 
a dedicated and concerned parent 
the disorder is probably relatively rare but we suspect its 
more common than we think because its so very difficult to 
recognize said david waller director of child and adolescent 
psychiatry at the university of texas soutwestern medical center in 
dallas 
besides few doctors are comfortable with confronting a 
distraught mother who has just spent another sleepless night at the 
childs bedside and asking are you doing something to that 
kid said theodore nadelson chief of psychiatry at the veterans 
administration medical center in boston 
some mothers have slipped their own blood into a childs mouth 
or urine samples one was discovered giving a hospitalized infant 
an enema and putting the fluid in the childs mouth another was 
found to have been giving her child massive doses of a drug to 
force vomiting the child died 
just what motivates such behavior is not well understood 
it appears to be a way to signal distress waller said and the 
parent gets a lot of reward from being seen as a wonderful 
caring parent in her role as helping the child get good medical 
care 
nadelson sees it as a pathological expression of hostility 
against doctors and society he considers it an addiction people 
who do it once will do it again consistently its very exciting 
usually only one favored child is singled out for what the 
mother and child consider a game he said 
treating the disorder is very difficult because people deny that 
they have the problem waller said there have been anecdotal 
reports of some treatment successes said allen palmer clinical 
instructor of psychiatry at harvard medical school but nadelson 
said he believes no treatment really works 
once a case is uncovered the major goal is to protect the 
child waller said that sometimes means a courtordered change in 
custody 
most children involved in munchausen by proxy are infants or 
toddlers but they can occasionally be older children like the boy 
in the cystic fibrosis scam 
why do the older children go along with it 
its the only kind of love the child knows nadelson said 
if its love youre looking for youll take it under any 
circumstances

a new school exercise program that replaces 
competition with individual tests and health education could 
reverse the decline in fitness among american children while 
helping them avoid injury experts say 
the american college of sports medicine is just starting to 
promote the program called fit youth today or fyt which was 
developed with the support of the american health and fitness 
foundation in austin texas 
it is stateoftheart exercise science put into a workable 
form for educators said wiliam squires professor of health 
fitness and nutrition at texas lutheran college and chairman of the 
task force that developed fyt 
unlike conventional school athletic programs fyt does not favor 
naturally gifted athletes it rewards each student for attaining 
his or her own fitness goals whatever the level of athletic 
ability said squires 
the fyt program represents a real departure from traditional 
fitness testing in this country he said at a recent symposium 
here it includes an educational curriculum intended to teach 
students about the importance of maintaining physical activity 
throughout life 
less than 50 percent of american children have adequate 
heartlung endurance and 40 percent of those 58 years old have 
signs of elevated blood pressure obesity or elevated cholesterol 
all of which increase the risk of heart disease squires said 
the decline in youth fitness is real and is overwhelmingly 
supported by study after study 
the consequences could be disastrous he said citing a study 
reported by the us centers for disease control last year that 
concluded lack of exercise was as strongly linked to heart disease 
as smoking high blood pressure and high cholesterol 
in conventional programs students are often measured against 
norms set by their peers fyt conditions them not to run faster or 
jump higher than others but to be able to jog a set distance in 20 
minutes perform certain exercises demonstrating strength and 
flexibility and reduce body fat specified levels 
the key point is that the goals emphasize aerobic fitness 
strength and weight loss not maximum performance squires said 
carl caspersen an exercise physiologist and epidemiologist at 
the cdc in atlanta said fyts success will be measured by how 
well it motivates changes in behavior and guarantees an active 
lifestyle 
it is the physical activity were interest in and if the 
testing encourages activity thats what were trying to achieve 
fyt also is designed to avoid athletic injuries that can have 
more serious consequences in children than they do in adults 
children are unusually susceptible overuse injuries said 
dr lyle micheli an orthopedist and director of the division of 
sports medicine at childrens hospital in boston 
these occur when joints and bones with soft growing surfaces are 
repeatedly subjected to small bumps and stresses which may alone 
be painless but can add up to significant damage after prolonged 
exercise without proper training and conditioning 
children undergoing the adolescent growth spurt between about 
ages 12 and 14 become less flexible and are especially likely to 
suffer overuse injuries micheli said adding coaches need to be 
trained to recognize subtle damage 
he cited littleleague elbow in which children who arent 
taught to throw properly can chip tiny flakes off their throwing 
elbow ultimately those chips grow into pebblesized pieces that 
can cause excruciating pain and can end a young baseball players 
season abruptly 
is running good for kids absolutely he said is too much 
running bad for kids absolutely the question is how much is too 
much

a solution of iron oxide injected into a patients 
veins can significantly improve the ability of magnetic scanning 
machines to pinpoint extremely small cancers of the liver doctors 
say 
the development should make it possible to detect this kind of 
cancer early when it can still be removed surgically and to 
better determine how far it has progressed dr david d stark and 
colleagues at massachusetts general hospital reported in the august 
issue of the journal radiology 
doctors using the technique administer the iron oxide then take 
a crosssectional picture with a standard magnetic resonance 
imaging or mri scanner the iron oxide is absorbed by healthy 
cells but not by cancerous ones making the cancers clearly stand 
out on magnetic pictures 
tests on 60 people showed that the technique could spot tumors 
as tiny as 3 millimeters three times smaller can be found with 
other scanning methods 
whether liver cancer is treated with surgery chemotherapy or 
radiation depends on the stage of the disease 
our purpose is to reduce some of the anguish of misdiagnosis 
and unnecessary surgery as well as their cost by accurate 
detection of metastases spread in the liver which before now 
were too small to be visible early enough to appropriately stage 
the patients disease prior to treatment said stark

superconductors usually repel magnets but new 
experiments show that with slight alterations theyll attract and 
hang suspended from magnets raising the prospect of their use in 
frictionless bearings 
the researchers added silver oxide to the traditional 
superconductor mixture of yttrium barium copper and oxygen in 
pellets that they chilled in liquid nigrogen to make them 
superconducting when they lowered a magnet toward a pellet a 
supercurrent appeared on the pellets surface that repelled the 
magnet but when the magnet was pulled back the weakening of the 
magnetic field affecting the pellet triggered another supercurrent 
that led to attraction toward the magnet 
the attraction was strong enough to suspend the superconductor

what sounds like an allergy to sex is more likely 
a reaction to a common nasal inflammation a doctor says of a 
patient who sneezes repeatedly after intercourse 
this is the most unusual problem i have ever been presented 
with by a patient dr william h hunter of clemson sc wrote 
in the questionandanswer section of last weeks journal of the 
american medical association 
the problem is probably due to vasomotor rhinitis a fairly 
common syndrome in which the nasal passages are chronically 
inflamed responded dr jeffrey a wald of san diego calif 
the condition is characterized by hyperactive or 
imbalanced control of certain nervoussystem responses wald 
said some nasal tissue is similar to that in the penis so sexual 
arousal thus may cause swelling of the mucous membranes inside the 
nose and an increase in nasal secretions he said 
those symptoms likely trigger the sneezing attacks in hunters 
patient a 60yearold man with a history of allergies because 
of the nervous system impairment brought on by the rhinitis wald 
wrote 
those suffering from rhinitis frequently dont respond to 
traditional treatment antihistimines and decongestants or 
complain of side effects he wrote suggesting intranasal use of a 
drug called ipratropium bromide if traditional treatment doesnt 
work

a new variety of corn provides higher quality 
protein than common types and could greatly help many of the 
worlds undernourished people a national research council 
committee says 
the qualityprotein maize looks and tastes like common corn 
but is nearly as good a protein source as skim milk the committee 
said 
corn is a dietary staple for some 200 million people including 
maybe half the worlds undernourished population in some parts of 
latin america and africa it is the primary or sole protein source 
for young children 
but protein in traditional corn does not contain enough of two 
essential amino acids lysine and tryptophan so corn itself is not 
enough for acceptable growth and health especially in children 
the sick and pregnant and lactating women the council said in a 
statement 
the new corn variety was developed at mexicos international 
center for the improvement of maize and wheat the committee report 
expressed confidence that it will be grown worldwide before the 
turn of the century

people should be nosy about what aunt minnie 
died of or what chronic diseases other relatives have had because 
it may reveal inherited hazards in the family a genetics expert 
says 
questions about diseases in the family are not offensive if they 
are framed as requests to help future generations and you really 
have an obligation to ask because it may be something that somebody 
other than you is at risk for said judith hall professor of 
medical genetics at the university of british columbia in vancouver 
older members have an obligation to pass along the information 
they have hall said after a recent science writers conference 
sponsored by the american academy of pediatrics 
i think its absolutely legitimate to ask for an autopsy 
report which can reveal inherited conditions such as 
hemochromatosis a buildup of iron in the tissues that can 
complicate other diseases she added 
for the family history questions should focus on causes of 
death chronic illnesses reasons for hospitalization longterm 
medication or chronic medical care before age 50 cancer before age 
60 cancer in both breasts diseases that killed more than one 
family member and heart attacks or strokes before age 50 
the information should be passed on to relatives and the family 
doctor 
every person carries five to eight genes that can increase the 
risk of disease in offspring if the other parent has a 
corresponding genetic defect hall said for example one in 20 
caucasians carries the defective gene that causes cystic fibrosis 
one in 10 blacks carries the sickle cell anemia gene 
she also said half of all admissions to pediatric hospitals 
involve conditions with an inherited predisposition such as kidney 
disease cancer diabetes and heart abnormalities

definitive agreement to buy bumble bee seafoods inc a privately 
held producer of canned tuna and other seafood 
terms of the agreement were not announced pillsbury said in a 
prepared statement

portion of the costs associated with the bumble bee acquisition

company has indicated the division is not part of pillsburys 
longterm strategic plans according to the statement 
todays announcements represent a continuation of our 
commitment to quality branded products with unique strengths that

government sugar policy can be sweet for 
domestic producers who enjoy high price supports or bitter for 
foreign sugarproducing countries whose access to the american 
market is limited by strict quotas an agriculture department 
report says 
although fewer than 1 percent of american farmers grow sugar 
cane or sugar beets the commodity is one of the most heavily 
protected by price supports and import quotas the report said 
those in favor of current policy say federal protection is 
necessary for the survival of the us sugar industry without it 
they say it would be impossible for american growers to compete 
with cheaper sugar from countries that have much lower production 
costs 
another argument is that the us corn industry also benefits 
from higher sugar prices by boosting demand for hfcs or high 
fructose corn syrup in soft drinks and many other food products 
but usda analysts say the other side of the coin includes higher 
retail prices for american sugar consumers and lost sales because 
of import quotas for some us allies who depend greatly on sugar 
as an export commodity 
sugar crops are supported at the equivalent of 18 cents per 
pound of raw sugar equivalent through nonrecourse loans made 
by the departments commodity credit corp it means that if market 
prices fall below the loan rate sugar processors can forfeit their 
collateral without penalty 
in that case the loan obligation is canceled and the ccc takes 
over ownership of the foreclosed sugar and holds it as surplus 
to minimize the risk of forfeiture and to head off large rises 
in ccc holdings the market price must be high enough to cover the 
loan rate plus interest plus marketing charges the desired price 
is called the market stabilization price or msp for 198788 the 
msp is 2176 cents per pound 
in the first quarter of this year the dutypaid price of raw 
sugar delivered to new york averaged 2203 cents per pound well 
above the msp comparatively the world price of sugar based 
on caribbean shipping points was less than 10 cents per pound 
to prevent lowerpriced foreign sugar from pulling down the us 
domestic price import quotas allocated to specific countries have 
been set each year since 1982 the quotas keep the supply tight 
enough to maintain prices near the msp says economist robert barry 
of the departments economic research service 
if the estimates of supply and demand are accurate domestic 
sugar prices stay high enough to prevent loan forfeitures barry 
writes in the forthcoming august issue of farmline magazine a 
loan forfeiture presents a surplus and storage problem for the 
ccc 
federal law stipulates that the sugar price support program is 
to be operated at no net cost to the taxpayers 
the cost of the program is basically paid for by american 
consumers through higher prices for table sugar and products that 
contain sugar barry said 
who benefits growers and processing companies who are 
guaranteed the support price also indirectly the corn sweetener 
industry which has seen hfcs become the dominant sweetener for 
soft drink manufacturers barry said 
glucose and dextrose also made from corn for many years had 
held about 17 percent of the calorietype sweetener market but 
when the new liquid hfcs came along it became the major caloric 
sweetener used in soft drinks 
in 1988 per capita consumption of hfcs is forecast at 695 
pounds per american 10 percent more than the average for sugar 
foreign manufacturers of products containing sugar and american 
consumers of certain imported gourmet food items made from 
lowercost foreign sugar also benefit from the us policy 
meanwhile barry said the price support program has encouraged 
greater us domestic sugar production thereby reducing import 
requirements adding to the world export surplus and keeping world 
prices low 
sugarimporting nations also benefit he said by encouraging 
surpluses and low world sugar prices the support program of the 
united states and some other countries create a windfall for 
the soviet union japan and china the major sugar importers 
barry said the program also has an effect on us employment 
when import quotas shrink refineries close because they have less 
foreign raw sugar to process since 1982 eight plants have closed 
eliminating more than 7000 jobs he said and additional jobs are 
lost when us manufacturers of sugarcontaining products reduce 
output 
the highest cost of the sugar program is paid indirectly by 
sugar exporters barry said for years the united states was the 
largest importer with foreign shipments reaching a peak of 61 
million tons in 1977 and averaging 42 million tons a year from 
1975 to 1981 
in 1988 the us sugar import quota initially was about 750000 
tons but was increased friday to 106 million tons 
several bills in congress would alter the sugar program one 
would reduce the support price to 12 cents per pound from the 
current level of 18 cents over a period of four crop years also 
the import quota would be increased by 500000 tons a year for four 
years beginning in 1989 
barry said that the lower support should lower market prices 
and this would probably discourage production in the united states 
and increase the demand for imported sugar

exxon corp the nations largest oil company 
today reported a 4 percent increase in secondquarter net income as 
higher refining and chemicals earnings offset lower exploration and 
production results 
exxon said it earned 12 billion or 90 cents a share up from 
net income of 115 billion or 81 cents a share in the second 
quarter of 1987 
revenue for the quarter rose 7 percent to 2163 billion from 
2016 billion a year ago 
exxon chairman lg rawl noted that margins were stronger as 
supply costs dropped and product prices firmed during the 
quarter he also said increased demand for petroleum products 
boosted sales volume in both the united states and abroad 
earnings from exploration and production operations totaled 703 
million 183 million less than the yearago period the company 
noted that lower crude oil sales to its own refineries as well as 
to outside customers coupled with higher expenses to offset 
increased crude production from new and expanded oil fields 
the companys chemicals operation reported an 89 million 
increase in earnings to 314 million while higher copper prices 
helped the coal and minerals unit report net income of 8 million 
compared with a 14 million loss a year ago 
exxon reported corporate and financing charges of 172 million 
up from 24 million a year go 
for the first six months exxon reported net income of 266 
billion or 196 a share up 20 percent from 222 billion or 
156 a share in the first half of 1987 
revenue during the period totaled 4363 billion up 10 percent 
from revenue of 396 billion in the yearago period

the fivemember opec pricing committee 
has decided in principle to meet aug 3 in lausanne switzerland 
primarily to deal with a decision by the united arab emirates to 
increase its oil production a newsletter reported monday 
the respected middle east economic survey said the committee of 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries is expected to 
go through the formal motions of reviewing the market situation 
but it said the main topic on the agenda will be the uaes 
unilateral decision to allocate itself an official quota of 15 
million barrels a day and the impact of this on opecs production 
quota and the market 
there has been no official announcement of the meeting of the 
committee comprisng oil ministers of nigeria algeria indonesia 
saudi arabia and venezuela 
a final decision on the meeting may depend on the visit of opec 
secretarygeneral subroto of indonesia to the uae the 
newsletter said he is expected there later this week after 
finishing the moslem pilgrimage to mecca in saudi arabia 
the middle east economic survey said dr subroto faces a 
difficult task because the uaes supreme petroleum council 
decided july 18 to increase production to 15 million barrels a 
day the uaes opecset production quota is 948000 barrels a 
day 
crude oil prices have fallen below the opec benchmark price of 
18 a barrel even without the increase in production by the 
uae largely because of increased nonopec production and 
abovequota production by opec members 
to enforce the 18 price opec alloted each of its members a 
quota with total opec production set at 15 million barrels a day 
this excludes iraq which refused its allotted quota of 154 
million barrels a day and has insisted on a quota equal to that of 
iran its persian gulf war opponent or 237 million barrels a day 
meanwhile iraq has been producing at a level of about 27 million 
barrels a day

amfac inc which two months ago unveiled 
an 800 million leveraged buyout plan announced monday that it is 
negotiating the sale of the company with several unidentified 
bidders 
amfac said in a statement that it received bids over the weekend 
that were in the high 40s per share the company did not 
elaborate and warned investors that no assurances can be given as 
to the probable outcome of the negotiations 
amfac chairman henry walker jr said the company has instructed 
its financial advisors to work to finalize the best transaction 
for the company and its shareholders 
in late may amfac management proposed to acquire the company 
for 41 a share or 8077 million 
amfacs shares consistently have traded above managements 
offering price indicating wall street expected the bid to be 
improved in early trading on the new york stock exchange monday 
amfac jumped 112 to 4787 
analysts have speculated that amfacs managementled buyout was 
a move designed to stave off a takeover threat by castle amp cook 
inc a los angelesbased concern that holds a large block of amfac 
stock 
two months ago castle amp cooke held 73 percent of amfacs 
roughly 172 million oustanding common shares and had received 
federal clearance to increase its holdings to 15 percent 
in addition castle amp cooke chairman david h murdock at the 
time owned another 26 percent of amfacs outstanding shares 
analysts have said castle amp cooke was most interested in amfacs 
valuable real estate holdings in hawaii which total about 56400 
acres while amfac is hawaiis largest landowner the no 2 slot is 
held by castle amp cooke which through its dole food company is the 
worlds largest pineapple producer 
some analysts said that amfacs buyout offer does not adequately 
take into account the value of the companys hawaiian property 
amfac spokeswoman deborah demer had no comment on whether castle 
amp cooke was among the bidders for the company 
amfac is a diversified services company with main lines of 
business in food processing hotels and resorts retail 
agriculture and property it reported revenue of 22 billion last 
year the companys principal executive offices are located in 
honolulu

corn and soybean futures plunged their permitted 
limits in early trading today on the chicago board of trade in 
reaction to scattered showers over the weekend and forecasts for 
rain today in the eastern midwest 
crop futures opened slightly lower then plummeted after the 
november soybean contract slipped below last weeks low of 815 a 
bushel analysts said 
the limit losses of 10 cents a bushel for corn and 30 cents a 
bushel for soybeans suggested soybean futures may extend to six 
days the sharp decline that began a week ago 
crop experts say the recent midwestern rains have been too 
spotty to cause great improvement in the droughtdamaged corn and 
soybean crops but the markets perception is that the situation 
is much better than it was said ted mao grain specialist with 
shearson lehman hutton inc 
certainly the markets are reflecting a concern that the crop 
is making a major recovery he said 
in early trading wheat was 7 cents to 13 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in september at 371 a bushel corn was 8 
cents to 10 cents lower with september at 302 a bushel oats 
were unchanged to the limit 10 cents lower with september at 250 
a bushel soybeans were 11 cents to 30 cents lower with august at

at the research and development offices of these 
automakers pushing a test car to the limits means giving it a good 
shove around a 20foot plastic proving ground 
in the us toy car industry matchbox cars usa is one of the 
big three last year the moonachie njbased company sold 77 
million vehicles more than ford motor co chrysler corp and 
general motors corp put together 
the other members of the tiny big three mattel inc maker of 
hot wheels and the upstart lewis galoob toys inc maker of micro 
machines are heavy hitters in a business devoid of controversy and 
lawsuits 
weve never had a recall we have no smog problems no safety 
problems said larry wood mattels top designer of hot wheels 
cars 
wood spent three years designing cars for ford motor co in 
dearborn mich in the 1960s before joining the hawthorne 
califbased mattel and downsizing his designs for the pintsize 
customer 
when i worked in detroit i did a few door handles and tail 
lights so far ive done every hot wheels car since 1968 he 
said 
these days wood is designing hot wheels 1990 line trying to 
anticipate the car buyers desires nearly as far into the future as 
detroit automakers 
i think they have gone a little more conservative in the last 
few years now kids seem to like the standard sporty cars he 
said 
to anticipate designs woods sifts through automotive trade 
magazines that often offer an advance peek of what detroit tokyo 
or stuttgart plan to offer in upcoming model years 
if detroit or japan or germany come out with an exciting car 
or different profile we take a look at it wood said 
matchbox was so taken by fords taurussable design that it 
copied the newage look for its 164 scale diecast miniatures 
if we see a trend developing in auto design we will stay with 
the trend and capture it in our cars said jim walsh matchbox 
marketing director obviously the ford taurus is a pretty sleek 
design and its something thats caught on with the public 
in september south san francisco califbased lewis galoob 
will offer toy cars that change color in the sun the new option 
strays slightly from galoobs philosophy of keeping its micro 
machines realistic 
kids are not crazy for fantasy marketing manager marjorie 
forrest said they dont want a car that doesnt look like a car 
kids today are very sophisticated they know what a lamborghini 
countache is and what a rolls royce is 
galoob expects to sell 45 million vehicles in 1988 just its 
second year in the market its micro machines are about 1 inches 
long smaller than hot wheels or matchboxes forrest said 
sports cars and military and construction vehicles are the hot 
sellers among the rugrunning set 
basically kids like things that are power oriented the 
feeling of speed or power is what kids gravitate to said 
matchboxs walsh 
adults and children apparently split the purchases evenly said 
mattels wood with children often choosing what they see on 
television for instance a miniature version of the white ferrari 
testarossa driven in miami vice is one of the most popular toy 
sellers 
the children show some loyalty toward americanmade cars walsh 
says because thats what they often see on the streets that 
loyalty can carry over into their adulthood he said 
if they happen to like fourwheeldrive cars as a kid theres 
a strong possibility theyll like fourwheel vehicles as an 
adult walsh said in my opinion if you like a particular type 
of car as a kid youre apt to grow up and like them 
thats good news for detroit automakers who usually charge no 
royalties to miniature automakers who replicate their cars 
anytime you get your product in the mind of the car buyer or a 
young person you enhance your reputation said chrysler 
spokesman bf mullins 
we think it does a lot of good you get involved in a lot of 
shelf space in department stores it also gets young people 
involved in your product the bottom line is consideration of your 
product 
when chrysler introduced its caravan and voyager minivans it 
passed out matchbox versions to the press as souvenirs mullins 
said 
ford officials review miniatures modeled after their cars to 
make sure they measure up 
we want it a toy to be very authentic ford spokesman dave 
krupp said we want it to be accurate in every detail we 
consider this child a future car buyer 
and while children are the primary market collectors also make 
up small fragment of their sales walsh says there are about 20000 
matchbox collectors in the country who trade and sell vehicles 
some worth up to 200 each 
overall the miniature car industry is cruising steadily 
this is a field that is growing but do not expect dramatic 
growth from one year to the next said david s leibowitz a toy 
industry analyst for american securities in new york city 
the cars usually take nine months to get from the drawing board 
to production which is usually performed at mini assembly lines in 
the orient wood said 
before they reach full production the miniature car makers 
often have groups of kids rate them and describe what they like 
about a particular model 
if a vehicle makes the grade its down to the test track where 
executives can briefly escape the pressures of business and test 
ride their product 
we have little tracks down in research and development 
said matchboxs walsh its a plastic track we shoot them around 
and have fun with them

for shirley puryear the road to joining 
the rothschilds and the gallos began with a batch of homemade plum 
wine 
the home brew made with directions from a 199 book a 
fivegallon jug and some plastic tubing was terrible said the 
coowner of the awardwinning bonair winery 
things have improved quite a bit since then and the puryears 
are among several small family winemakers in washington who compete 
for shelf space and medals with corporate giants like chateau ste 
michelle the states largest 
its so much fun and so romantic mrs puryear a former 
social worker in california said recently this has surpassed my 
wildest dreams 
some of the family winemakers are hobbyists that barely break 
even but others are trying hard to make a living at it 
the glamour fades fast once you get into the business 
admitted tom campbell owner of horizons edge winery in zillah 
nestled in the rolling countryside near yakima wash 
startup costs for small wineries average about 270000 and 
competition is fierce for supermarket and wine list space 
about seven of the states 70 wineries produce under 2083 
cases or 5000 gallons per year according to the washington wine 
institutemost of those under 5000 gallons are family wineries 
said simon siegl director of the trade group 
by contrast giants like chateau ste michelle produce about 
500000 cases per year and enjoy national distribution 
washington is the nations third largest winemaker after 
california and new york but is far behind californias 700 
wineries 
washington winemakers have a history of cooperation spurring a 
growth from 11 wineries in 1977 to the present 70 the roots of 
many wineries are intertwined 
for instance mike conway owner of latah creek wine cellars in 
spokane originally moved up from california to help open wordens 
washington winery then he helped start hogue cellars of prosser 
before securing financial help from the hogues to launch latah 
creek in 1983 
the financial help was in exchange for my winemaking at hogue 
cellars said conway whose winery produces 15000 cases a year 
there are many similar stories because its an expensive 
business to get into 
its a good way to make a small fortune out of a large one 
said campbell who also owns montanas mission mountain winery the 
only one in that state 
if your total end is to make money this is not the business 
to be in said campbell one of several alumni of the winemaking 
program at the university of californiadavis who operate in the 
state 
horizons edge which opened in 1985 and produces 2500 cases a 
year is approaching 100000 in annual sales he said 
i could make more money on the capital in cds he said 
campbell has also worked for chateau ste michelle stewart 
vineyards and tucker cellars in sunnyside and blackwood canyon in 
benton city 
i decided i better carve a niche for myself while i still 
could said campbell a native of missoula mont 
like most of the small wineries his major market is in state 
with many of the sales to visitors in the tasting room 
everyone who comes through is having fun said mrs puryear 
of the often raucous mix of visitors to bonairs tiny tasting room 
its not like buying asparagus at safeway 
the tasting room is an important fixture in the small wineries 
because up to 80 percent of the product is sold there especially 
by those that do not have wide distribution 
we get hundreds of people per week here in the summer mrs 
puryear said even though the room can hold less than a dozen at 
one time 
we get people in here who own wineries in france or a local 
who drops by carrying a can of beer she said 
her tasting room has maps of the united states and the world 
with pins showing the states and countries of visitors delaware is 
the only state without a pin 
the first person from delaware will get a bottle of free 
wine she said our choice 
owners of washingtons family wineries some of which produce 
considerably more than 5000 gallons come from a variety of 
backgrounds for instance 
john williams and jim holmes owners of kiona vineyards in 
benton city are engineers on the hanford nuclear reservation a 
federal plutoniummaking facility 
dave staton owner of staton hills and a pioneer in wine 
exports to japan and taiwan founded the wapato winery a decade ago 
after working as an attorney and as an executive for twa 
michael and patricia manz a child psychiatrist and teacher 
respectively began mountain dome winery in spokane four years ago 
they make champagne exclusively and dont plan to market any of 
their product until 1992 
dr george stewart of sunnyside established stewart vineyards 
in 1983 
ray small of walla walla half owner of the highlyregarded 
woodward canyon winery says winemaking is more profitable than 
raising hogs 
small put up the money when his son rick wanted to go into 
winemaking in 1981 and they produce up to 8000 gallons per year 
the winery is actually a metal building on their farm that 
originally served as a truck garage and paint shop he said 
weve got four or five operations here and some of them are 
hurting pretty good like the wheat business and the hog 
business ray said but the winery is in the black 
winemaking has an attractive sophisticated image but 
washington owners say the life isnt quite like falcon crest 
the television series about intrigues in californias wine country 
everybody asks about falcon crest said mrs puryear i 
watched one episode and they stuck a body in a wine tank 
its not like falcon crest she said

reuters holdings plc the information services 
group said monday its halfyear net profit rose 243 percent over 
a year ago as its financial information and dealing services 
continued to grow vigorously 
however revenue from trading room systems fell sharply as 
investment companies implemented sharp cutbacks reuters said 
reuters said its net profit for the six months ended june 30 
came to 634 million pounds or 1084 million or 151 pence a 
share compared with 51 million pounds or 122 pence a share in 
the same period a year ago 
reuters said its revenue rose 177 percent to 4714 million 
pounds from 4004 million pounds 
the company did not give out quarterly results it is not 
required to release them under british law 
the company which owns the reuters news agency said revenue 
growth was curbed by the strength of the pound and a decline in 
contributions from trading room systems 
glen renfrew reuters managing director and chief executive 
said a slowdown in orders for trading room systems was mostly the 
result of cutbacks in investment firms in new york and london 
but orders from japan were excellent and orders from continental 
europe were good he said

the hungarian professor who frustrated millions 
with his rubiks cube is introducing his latest mindtwister 
a puzzle he says even he hasnt even solved a spokeswoman for the 
toy company marketing the product said monday 
but erno rubiks failure has not arisen from a lack of ability 
merely a lack of time to puzzle out the secrets of rubiks clock 
said melanie bateman of matchbox toys ltd 
really its not because its impossible hes just too busy 
to take the time to do it she said adding that the new toy will 
be launched at a major london toy store saturday 
rubik 44 a professor of architecture and design at the academy 
of arts and crafts in budapest invented the multcolored rubiks 
cube as a teaching aid 
after the success of the cube which sold over 120 million units 
worldwide he founded a private business rubiks studio in 
conjunction with the hungarian government 
the studio has produced rubiks magic another toy puzzle and a 
series of products with business applications 
his new toy requires a player to get 18 clocks on both sides of 
a plastic disc to strike midnight simultaneously by twisting wheels 
which turn some of the hands but not others according to ms 
bateman 
speaking of his latest invention rubik warned in a press 
release dont cheat by being taught how to do it by someone 
else it is much more satisfying to decode the puzzle on your own 
it is important to remember that your brain needs to be kept 
in shape my new puzzle can help because it enables you to focus 
entirely on finding the formula which although it may seem 
frustrating at the time will do you good he added 
rubiks clock will retail for about 12 ms bateman said

the chrysler corp and the united auto 
workers signed a contract monday covering workers affected by the 
scheduled end of auto production in kenosha and the closing of the 
stamping plant in milwaukee 
marc stepp uaw vice president and director of its chrysler 
department said he hoped there would be life after current 
production which is scheduled to end in december at the former 
american motors co plant in kenosha 
we hope this will not be the end of this operation it is our 
hope that it does continue stepp said 
the agreement covers 5500 workers in kenosha and 450 at the 
stamping plant which already has closed 
stepp said he was particularly happy about the commitment in the 
contract calling for chrysler to pay back amc profitsharing that 
amc had promised members of uaw locals 72 and 75 in exchange for 
concessions 
chrysler acquired the kenosha carmaking plant and the milwaukee 
stamping operation when it bought amc last year chrysler initially 
planned to keep the plant open for several years but then 
announced it did not need the production capability 
anthony st john vice president for human resources at 
chrysler also cited provisions in the pact calling for worker 
benefits to continue for up to two years after the layoffs and to 
allow special early retirements for some senior workers 
st john said the decision to stop building cars in kenosha as 
of december stands 
when asked if there was any chance of it continuing into 1989 
st john said i would suggest that the answer is no to that 
st john said the company projects that the produced in kenosha 
at a separate plant that employs about 800 workers will be needed 
through 1992 but he said it is possible that plant could close 
before that 
however it certainly is not likely he said

a think tank has been given 10 months to 
answer a question that has concerned consumers and plagued 
philatelists since the dawn of postal automation why wont stamps 
stick 
battelle memorial institute which recently received a 700000 
contract from the us postal service convenes a meeting here 
thursday in hopes of making a sticky situation stickier said don 
mcdowell general manager of the stamp division of the us postal 
service in washington 
about 100 representatives of adhesive manufacturers and paper 
companies expected to attend the oneday meeting will be asked to 
share their thoughts and in some cases their secret formulas 
i dont think 700000 is too much to pay for a stamp that 
sticks he said in a telephone interview compare that to the 
fact that stamps are an 8 billionayear business 
the columbusbased institute is trying to find a perfect stamp 
glue one that not only will keep stamp and envelope together from 
the point of origin to destination but will taste a little better 
mcdowell said 
the public insists that it at least if it cant stick not 
taste so bad he said the problem is finding a consensus on 
what tastes good some people like liver others dont so its got 
to be something that may not taste great and may not taste like 
anything at all 
he said consumers have repeatedly suggested more flavorful glues 
that taste like cherry vanilla and vodka 
oh they have suggested it but i hardly think vodka would be 
appropriate he said laughing no jerry falwell were not 
planning on that at all 
neither mcdowell nor battelle consider the issue a laughing 
matter 
sure people giggle but its not very funny to us its very 
important to us and to the people who want their letters to reach 
their destinations mcdowell said 
he said battelles task will not be easy 
do you have any idea how many adhesives there are in the 
world he said the postal service uses three kinds of adhesives 
now which mcdowell describes as shiny not shiny and halfway in 
between 
he could not estimate how many stamps are lost in transit every 
year but said the problem has gotten worse since the postal 
service began to automate in the early 1970s 
before then when it was manual the impact to a stamp was 
like a car hitting a brick wall at 5 mph now its like a car 
hitting a brick wall at 60 mph because these machines accelerate 
and decelerate so fast when the envelope stops the stamp doesnt 
want to he said 
slowing the machines wont fix the problem he said the rising 
volume of mailed items means the system will have to speed up 
about 35 million stamped items move through the system every year 
the american philatelic society an organization of stamp 
collectors has argued that not only is the adhesive not sticky 
enough it also eats through the paper which decreases a stamps 
value 
one philatelist does not agree that a new glue is needed 
mw martin of the topical philatelic house in columbus says the 
glue is not the culprit he blames the disappearing stamp dilemma 
on human error and sorting machines that are not stampfriendly 
im in this business 40 years and i just dont see the 
nonsticky problem if they fall off sometimes its not the glue 
people arent licking them enough the envelope maybe has some dust 
on it i think the real problem is the machines at the post 
office he said

the japanese are breaking with a tradition of 
frugality to bring some luxury into their lives big cars 
european furniture diamond jewelry 
the government has been urging them to spend the yen they 
ordinarily put in the bank in hopes of spurring the domestic 
economy 
analysts say skyrocketing property values easy credit price 
stability and the yens rise in value are generating a fastgrowing 
market for luxury goods a turnaround from three years of slumping 
consumption when the surging yen subdued the exportdriven economy 
selling well are expensive and luxurious durable goods such as 
largesize tv sets refrigerators furniture and dining ware 
imported from europe said mitsuhiro hirose of the sales 
promotion division at matsuya co a major department store on 
tokyos bustling ginza 
a recent bank of japan report called brisk personal buying a 
key element of japans current economic success the government 
has cut income taxes and launched a 5trillionyen 40 billion 
public spending program spurring housing starts the bank cut its 
discount rate to a record low 25 percent and the public housing 
loan corp trimmed more than a percentage point off its interest 
rate currently 435 percent 
consumer demand as measured by department store sales jumped 82 
percent in april from a year earlier according to the japan 
department stores association total sales by 254 major department 
stores last year rose an average 47 percent every month the 
association said 
and the gross national product which measures total output of 
goods and services grew at an annualized rate of 113 percent in 
the first quarter of this year figures from the economic planning 
agency indicate 
people regard expensive new products as a means of being 
somewhat different from others said takayuki ikeda manager of 
the consumer electronics product division at mitsubishi electric co 
in 1985 the company began marketing its 37inch color television 
set the industry equivalent of 35inch american models for 
478000 yen 3825 
at first we never thought a largesized tv with a builtin 
picture tube would be accepted in japanese homes which some 
europeans have ridiculed as rabbit hutches ikeda said in an 
interview but the opposite is true people have realized that 
the larger the tv screen the more fun they can have the more 
feeling of real ambience 
japanese bought 96 million color tv sets last year 20 percent 
of which measured 22 inches or larger up 12 percent from 1986 
according to industry figures 
automakers are benefiting from the japanese who now want bigger 
more expensive cars toyota motor co in april sold 14673 of its 
largesize 46millionyen 37000 topoftheline crown models 
a 925percent jump from a year earlier 
peoples sense of money has become accentuated said isao 
takayama chief of the jewelry division at the swank mitsukoshi 
department stores several years ago you could buy a house for 50 
to 60 million yen now it costs up to 500 million yen 4 million 
it tends to dull peoples sense of money 
reflecting a demand for expensive ornaments imports of polished 
diamonds rose 616 percent to 106 million carats in the first four 
months of this year over last year according to the ministry of 
international trade and industry 
takayama said the hottest items are diamond rings priced at 2 
million yen 16000 
nowadays customers come in asking to see diamonds of about 100 
million yen 228000 he said four or five years ago that 
was the stuff of dreams

prices fell monday in quiet trading on the london 
stock exchange as the market awaited british economic reports due 
later in the week 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index fell 63 
points or 03 percent to 18385 after sinking as low as 18267 
shortly after the opening 
volume was a meager 2884 million shares compared with 4026 
million shares traded friday 
some traders said they were encouraged by the markets ability 
to claw back from its initial decline of 181 points 
the early declines came as the pound strengthened and stock 
prices had fallen friday in new york and earlier monday in tokyo 
were ticking a bit better all the time one equity salesman 
said 
but there was little news on which the market could trade 
traders said 
the salesman cautioned that dealings would likely remain light 
until release of british economic reports later in the week

shortly after the tokyo stock exchange opened last 
tuesday grimfaced japanese businessmen began filing into the 
lobby of sanyo securities co ltd in the ginza shopping district 
to track the markets performance 
their faces grew grim as a retreat that began the previous day 
in response to a jump in the us dollars value quickly turned 
into a rout 
before it was over the markets barometer the nikkei stock 
average of 225 issues had lost 51309 points its biggest loss of 
the year 
after a brief rebound at midweek the decline resumed 
stripping more than 600 points from the average by weeks end on 
monday the market rose 7655 points at the opening bell then 
slumped again to finish down 11781 at 2718353 
while the declines pale in comparison to the calamitous plunge 
of last october when new york markets set off a worldwide stock 
market panic they are worrisome nonetheless 
some japanese economists view the latest decline as a warning 
shot for the highflying japanese economy and they caution that 
the next black monday could be precipitated here 
i think these are continuing signs of confusion over the 
direction of the economy in japan said william p sterling 
senior economist for merrill lynch securities co in tokyo these 
are warning signals and people are nervous 
market analysts blamed the wave of selling on market shifts 
from steel and shipbuilding shares to electronics 
sterling said investors are trying to take their money into more 
stable stocks so they have a better chance of selling if the 
market falls 
when people have their eyes on the fire exit they buy those 
stocks he said 
the root of the concern appears to be the recent surge in the 
dollars value which has moved above the psychologically important 
level of 130 yen after a long decline some experts here also view 
the recent increase in american interest rates as a precursor of 
higher japanese rates 
the boost in the dollar sprang partly from an improvement in 
american trade statistics which show the imbalance between us 
imports and exports is shrinking that shift while good news for 
american industry threatens to divert the lifeblood of japans 
boom which has drawn its strength from a steady stream of exports 
to the united states 
the united states is seeing the high side of this process 
sterling said of the changing trade relationship but its trading 
partners are beginning to feel the heat this is now beginning to 
show a strain on the japanese economy 
sterling said there was so much growth last year that if the 
japanese economy had zero growth in 1988 it would still be 34 
percent above a year ago 
the japanese governments leading index of economic indicators 
fell two months in a row in march and april a decline two months 
in a row typically has meant a recession in japan within four to 
eight months 
industrial production was down 38 percent for april and may 
which portends zero or negative growth for the second quarter 
housing starts have been falling rapidly following a boom last 
year that raised real estate prices and cooled the enthusiasm of 
prospective home buyers 
the gloomy view is far from universal however last week a 
group of 21 japanese financial institutions issued a glowing report 
on the state of the economy saying growth through the fiscal year 
was expected to be 44 percent to 54 percent 
teruhiko mano an economist for the bank of tokyo said the 
recent market swings are merely an adjustment not an indicator 
of recession he also takes issue with the housing slowdown 
which he says is merely a reaction against prices that were too 
high to begin with 
the dollar went up and the market went down he said of the 
stock market drop our economy is reacting to the capitalistic 
system it shows it is working well

ah robins co reported monday that its 
secondquartyer earnings rose 39 percent on an 11 percent sales 
increase 
the pharmaceutical manufacturer which is operating with 
protection from its creditors under chapter 11 of the federal 
bankruptcy laws said its earnings were hurt by the accrual of 
certain costs and expenses that it expects will be incurred as part 
of its chapter 11 reorganization plan 
robins earned 8 million or 33 cents per share in the three 
months ended june 30 compared to 77 million or 32 cents per 
share a year earlier 
but the company said its earnings for the quarter would have 
increased 130 percent without the chapter 11 costs 
sales for the quarter rose to 2026 million from 1822 million 
in 1987 
operating earnings for the second quarter were 248 million up 
2 percent from the 245 million in the comparable period last year 
for the first six months of the year robins said it earned 
221 million or 91 cents per share down 34 percent from 337 
million or 140 a share a year ago 
sixmonth revenue rose 9 percent to 4287 million from 392 
million a year earlier 
robins sought chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in august 1985 as 
injury claims mounted against its dalkon shield birth control 
device 
the companys reorganization including a merger with the new 
yorkbased american home products corp is expected to receive 
court ratification later this summer

crop futures closed sharply lower monday on the 
chicago board of trade on speculation that droughtstressed corn 
and soybean fields were gradually recovering due to a wetter 
weather pattern in the midwest 
most contracts for future deliveries of corn and soybeans 
plunged their permitted daily limits 10 cents and 30 cents a 
bushel respectively soybeans for august delivery have skidded 
more than 190 a bushel over six consecutive losing sessions 
light scattered showers fell during the weekend and monday in 
the midwest continuing a pattern that developed in midjuly to 
replace the unusually warm and dry conditions that had dominated 
the region during the previous three months 
there is certainly a lot of varying opinion over how much 
benefit it may have done for the crop but traders clearly are 
responding to the fact that moisture exists and thats a 
significant departure from what we saw in april may and june 
said ted mao grain specialist with shearson lehman hutton inc in 
new york 
at the close wheat was 6 cents to 13 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in september at 371 a bushel corn was 7

troubled food giant pillsbury co named the head 
of rival general foods corp as its new top executive monday but 
the announcement drew a negative reaction on wall street 
analysts said they were skeptical that philip l smith who 
lacks solid experience in the restaurant business would be able to 
quickly turn around pillsburys flagging burger king fastfood 
chain as well as engage in tough competition to defend the 
companys consumer food products 
echoing those concerns pillsbury stock fell 150 a share to 
3537 in afternoon trading on the new york stock exchange 
smith 54 has been chairman of general foods the nations 
largest food concern and vice chairman of philip morris cos inc 
which acquired general foods in 1985 he is to begin his new job 
aug 1 
he is taking over from william h spoor who returned from 
retirement to run pillsbury on an acting basis nearly five months 
ago when the previous chief executive was pressured to leave the 
company 
minneapolisbased pillsbury the nations fourth largest food 
conglomerate produces green giant vegetables haagendazs premium 
ice creams and van de kamps frozen fish in addition to the 
5500unit burger king chain it also owns steak amp ale and 
bennigans restaurants 
separately pillsbury announced monday it had agreed to purchase 
bumble bee seafoods inc a privately held san diegobased producer 
of canned seafood with annual revenue of 265 million pillsbury 
also said it had decided to sell off its grain merchandising 
division and use the proceeds to finance the bumble bee acquisition 
in prepared statement spoor said that attracting a topflight 
chief executive has been a major priority he called smith a 
gifted and capable leader who has the unanimous support of our 
board of directors and the senior management 
analysts have been critical of pillsbury saying it lacked clear 
and vital leadership over the past few years 
its aftertax profit plummeted 62 percent in fiscal 1988 to 
693 million on sales of 62 billion largely because of a 
restructuring charge associated with the sale of the godfathers 
pizza chain and a number of other restaurant operations and 
consolidations 
the restaurant unit which accounts for nearly half of the 
companys total revenue reported a 5 percent drop in sales in the 
fiscal year ended may 31 as burger king continued to lose market 
share to rival mcdonalds corp 
pillsburys weakness has been more related to restaurants and 
if they got a guru in restaurants they may have been better off 
said edward froelich an analyst at pershing amp co 
pillsbury has been pouring as much as 200 million a year into 
touting burger king restaurants amid criticism that the advertising 
campaigns were less than effective the company also faces stiff 
competition in its consumer foods business 
under smiths leadership general foods also has suffered 
lagging growth and earnings you cant say his track record at 
general foods would lend itself to any wideeyed enthusiasm 
froelich said 
much of general foods difficulites can be linked to its core 
maxwell house coffee business which is suffering from lackluster 
growth but analysts point to other potential problems 
smith has been a big cheese in a company with a lot of easy 
brands said stephen carnes a managing director at piper jaffray 
amp hopwood in minneapolis referring to oscar mayer luncheon meats 
and jello brand gelatin 
because pillsbury has few highgrowth products smith will 
have to get down to trench warfare and he was never in that mode 
before carnes said 
while some analysts speculated that philip morris might be 
unhappy with smiths performance at general foods others suggested 
smith merely wanted to run his own show 
smith a 22year veteran of general foods said in a statement 
that pillsbury is a terrific company with fine businesses and 
excellent people 
im looking forward to leading this company aggressively with 
its exciting and challenging opportunities he said 
the 65yearold spoor returned to the helm at pillsbury after 
the ouster of john stafford whom spoor had groomed as his 
successor and who presided over pillsburys first earnings decline 
in 16 years spoor had run the company from 1973 through 1985 
speculation had been swirling on wall street recently that 
despite its difficulties pillsbury might be a takeover target 
but analysts are divided as to how attractive a takeover 
candidate pillsbury may be carnes for instance said pillsbury 
had too many wrecks in the ditch right now 
some people have said the burger king chain could fetch as much 
as 15 billion if it were spun off as a separate company but 
carnes estimated the chain would bring only about 900 million 
because it was at least two years away from a turnaround 
pilip morris chairman hamish maxwell issued a statement praising 
smiths tenure at general foods and said smiths position would not 
be filled maxwell said the heads of the subisidarys domestic 
foods coffee and oscar mayer units would report directly to him

representatives of fastfood giant mcdonalds 
corp testified monday that quality inns international inc was 
infringing upon its trademarks by using the name mcsleep inn for a 
new chain of economy hotels 
mcdonalds took immediate exception last september to the use of 
the mc prefix after quality inns announced the new chain of 
hotels which will offer a nights lodging for 20 to 29 
after repeated warnings from mcdonalds to stop using the name 
quality inns filed suit against the international hamburger chain 
asking a federal judge to declare that mcsleep does not infringe on 
the chains trademarks 
mcdonalds countersued quality inns charging that use of the 
mc prefix constitutes an infringement and that the public will 
likely confuse the inns with mcdonalds 
we wanted to remove any cloud that was hanging over quality 
said laurence hefter chief trial counsel for the lodging company 
based at silver spring md theres absolutely no likelihood of 
confusion with mcdonalds the mcsleep logo is very distinctive 
the mcsleep logo is a variation on the quality inns logo of a 
setting sun bordered by a black square very distinct from 
mcdonalds golden arch said hefter 
hefter said the mc prefix was selected because it connotes a 
clear impression of value affordable quality service mcdonalds 
may have played a part in promoting that type of image but we 
believe that it has gone beyond that into the lexicon he added 
mcdonalds began its defense monday in the trial which began 
july 18 before us district judge paul niemeyer 
roy t bergold jr vice president of advertising for 
mcdonalds said the company spent more than 404 million last year 
in advertising 
in one of more than a dozen videotaped mcdonalds commercials 
presented in court monday the promotional character ronald 
mcdonald taught children to put the prefix before many different 
words including mcfries mcmilk shakes and mcbest 
the purpose of the commercial was to create a mclanguage 
specifically associated with mcdonalds bergold said 
mcdonalds is the largest singlebrand television advertiser 
in the country he said surveys found that in the last four 
weeks 89 percent of the nations children between 2 and 
7yearsold have visited a mcdonalds and 96 percent of all adults 
have visited a mcdonalds at least once bergold testified 
were trying to establish the impact and awareness that 
mcdonalds has on the public and why its likely that theyre 
going to be confused by the mcsleep chain said karen kasander 
an attorney for mcdonald 
chief trial counsel for mcdonalds former maryland attorney 
general stephen h sachs said a mcdonaldsponsored survey 
indicated that more than 30 percent of the participants associated 
mcsleep with mcdonalds 
mcdonalds successfully sued the owner of a new york store 
called mcbagel a federal judge ruled that the business community 
generally recognizes that the mc formative stands as a symbol 
of mcdonalds services and products 
but hefter said other company names not associated with food 
bear the mc prefix including mcthrifty and mclube 
the mcsleep inns will offer a basic room with a bath but no 
pool meeting rooms food service or restaurant quality inn a 
subsidiary of manor care inc hopes to franchise about 200 such 
inns by 1991 
testimony in the trial is expected to end wednesday

phone solicitors beware bob bulmash has got your 
number 
bulmash makes repeat callers pay for his time he has even taken 
offenders to court and collected and said monday hes formed a 
group to help others do the same 
these big companies feel that they can cause this lowlevel 
annoyance that most of the nation feels is an invasion of 
their privacy said bulmash 42 who works as a lawyers 
assistant 
a nationwide telephone survey of 600 consumers found that 79 
percent think telephone sales calls are annoying said barry 
schlanker whose schlanker research services in linden nj 
conducted the survey last year 
bulmash said he became fed up with such calls a couple of years 
ago when a salesperson called and said hi if youd like to buy 
a magazine subscription well make a 12 percent gross donation to 
special olympics 
he started to offer a 5 donation when the guy says you 
dont have to hang up on me ill just call the next guy 
bulmash recalled 
i called the special olympics and said whats going on 
they assured me id never be bothered again he said 
but a year later he got another call on their behalf 
im not against special olympics but i am for my privacy in 
my home bulmash said 
when phone solicitors call he advises them any subsequent 
calls from your company will be accepted on a forhire basis for 
the use of my personal property and time 
bulmash said he warns he will charge 100 for their next call 
and so far he said hes collected about 250 
one case involved planosoft water conditioning co of nearby 
plano ill which wanted bulmash to buy a water conditioner 
the du page county judge who heard the case stood up and he 
said i was called recently and twice during the football game and 
im sick of these things bulmash said 
he won 97 cents the monthly cost of not listing his number in 
the telephone book 
its not the money he said its the fact that i as an 
american citizen have rights 
planosoft disagrees 
i think that hes very unreasonable i dont think he deserves 
to have a telephone said delphine malovich the companys owner 
were not intruding on his privacy all he has to say is hes 
not interested and hang up the phone she said 
planosoft has taken bulmashs name off their customer list 
and when a new supervisor calls him by mistake which has happened 
a few times they pay 
i think the last time we just sent him a 7 check and that 
made him happy ms malovich said 
in may he formed private citizens inc designed to help 
pestered people fight back for 15 members can have their names 
printed on a list to be sent to telemarketing companies with a 
warning that callers will be required to pay 
to solicit membership bulmash plans what else direct 
marketing 
but hell use the mails not the phone and envisions a flyer 
that reads junk mail help stop junk phone calls

gold prices took a tremendous hit today said steven pepper 
a vice president and bullion dealer at republic national bank 
last week traders bought gold and silver heavily on rumors 
about the silver miners strike in peru but monday there was 
panic selling as precious metals prices began to slip pepper 
said 
randolph donney a research analyst with elders futures inc 
said the metals market reacted to a drop in commodities prices and 
a rise in shortterm interest rates both developments are believed 
to be harbingers of a slowing in inflation while precious metals 
are considered a hedge during periods of higher inflation

closing at 7036 compared with late fridays 7606 
in earlier london trading silver was quoted at a late bid price

jack barbanel a first vice president with gruntal amp co inc 
said the dollar gained its strength from the drop in commodities 
prices including the plunge in gold and silver 
robert ryan senior foreign exchange trader irving trust co 
said position squaring also contributed to the dollars gains

mellon bank corp said monday it will shift 1 
billion in bad loans into a new independent bank to stabilize 
mellons earnings and improve its recently troubled finances 
last june we said wed deal with our problems as aggressively 
as we could that we were not going to disembowel the company in 
any form this step is just a logical extension said frank v 
cahouet chairman of the bank holding company that ranked as the 
nations 16thlargest at the end of 1987 
mellon will raise 525 million in fresh capital for its own 
operations while infusing the new grant street national bank with 
130 million in cash in exchange mellon will retain 100 million 
in preferred stock in the new bank and will pass along 30 million 
in common stock to mellons shareholders as a dividend 
the recapitalization plan is similar to one used by banks 
experiencing severe financial problems in which a portfolio of 
problem loans are transferred to a separate bad bank while a 
healthier parent bank retains the good loans cahouet said 
this is the first time however that the good bankbad bank 
approach has been adopted by a relatively healthy bank cahouet 
told a news conference 
grant street national will not take public deposits it will 
have its own own fivemember board of directors he said 
mellon last year reported losing 844 million because of 
potentially bad loans in the energydependent southwest and in 
developing countries in south america 
we could have managed the problems over the next three four 
or five years now at least were saving all that time and we can 
get on with developing the future of the institution said mellon 
president anthony terracciano 
standard and poors corp the securities rating firm said the 
move will bolster mellons finances help stabilize earnings and 
free up managers 
the new bank whose name reflects mellons street address in 
pittsburgh will buy the bad loans for 575 million in cash and 
securities a deep discount off their book value of 1 billion 
grant street national will sell 425 million to 450 million 
worth of highyield junk bonds underwritten by drexel burnham 
lambert inc an investment banking concern 
mellon will take a 200 million charge to thirdquarter earnings 
as a result of the deal cahouet said 
mellons exposure to risk will be limited to the 100 million in 
preferred shares it holds in the new bank 
mellons 525 million in new capital will come from 275 million 
in three series of preferred shares and 250 million in equity 
purchase contracts from a group of investors 
the 525 million will help meet anticipated funding guidelines 
that bank regulators are expected to impose in 1992 mellon 
officials said 
bank officials said they expect to receive regulatory approval 
for the recapitalization which should be completed in the third 
quarter

soybean futures prices settled at a twomonth low monday after 
falling for the sixth straight day on perceptions that a wetter 
weather pattern was bringing a gradual recovery of droughtstressed 
midwestern crops analysts said 
grain futures also finished sharply lower on the chicago board 
of trade 
on other markets precious metals futures plummeted cattle were 
up while pork futures were down energy futures fell and 
stockindex futures advanced 
as rain puddles dried outside the chicago board of trade most 
contracts for future deliveries of corn and soybeans plunged their 
respective daily limits of 10 cents and 30 cents a bushel 
the august soybean contract has skidded 191 a bushel over six 
consecutive losing sessions and finished monday at 800 
light scattered showers fell during the weekend and monday in 
the midwest continuing a pattern that developed in midjuly to 
replace the unusually warm and dry conditions that had dominated 
the region during the previous three months 
there is certainly a lot of varying opinion over how much 
benefit it may have done for the crop but traders clearly are 
responding to the fact that moisture exists and thats a 
significant departure from what we saw in april may and june 
said ted mao grain specialist with shearson lehman hutton inc in 
new york 
but richard loewy senior grain and oilseed analyst with 
prudentialbache securities inc in new york disagreed with 
weatherrelated explanations of the markets behavior 
loewy cited last weeks bullish longrange forecasts for a 
return to hot dry conditions in the farm belt and said the 
market is just not concerned about weather anymore 
he said mondays selloff probably was triggered by reports of 
large buildups of peanut oil and malaysian palm oil which compete 
in the market with soybean oil 
traders also were said to have sold on rumors that the national 
weather services new 6to10day outlook would predict continued 
wet weather in the midwest 
that forecast which was issued after the close did indeed 
predict abovenormal rainfall in most of the midwest during the 
first five days of next week 
wheat settled 6 cents to 13 cents lower with the contract for 
delivery in september at 371 a bushel corn was 7 cents to 10 
cents lower with september at 302 a bushel oats were 1 cents 
to 7 cents lower with september at 254 a bushel soybeans were 
22 cents to 30 cents lower with august at 800 a bushel 
the drop in crop futures helped trigger a collapse in precious 
metals futures prices on new yorks commodity exchange analysts 
said gold futures settled at their lowest levels since april 8 
1987 
investment demand for precious metals tends to rise and fall 
with expectations for inflation so analysts said the lower grain 
futures lower oil futures and mondays stronger dollar all 
contributed to the sharp decline in gold and silver futures 
the fact that it was a fairly thin market with relatively few 
people trading also contributed to it said john norris chief 
precious metals trader for citibank in new york 
gold settled 1630 to 1840 lower with august at 42660 a 
troy ounce silver was 57 cents to 628 cents lower with july at 
7036 a troy ounce 
on the chicago mercantile exchange most cattle futures ignored 
fridays bearish quarterly cattleonfeed report and settled higher 
in line with higher cash markets said thomas morgan president of 
sterling research corp of arlington heights ill 
pork futures fell sharply in reaction to another usda report 
showing nearrecord numbers of pork bellies in cold storage morgan 
said 
live cattle were 12 cent to 60 cent higher with august at 
6635 cents a pound feeder cattle were 10 cent lower to 53 cent 
higher with august at 7775 cents a pound hogs were 45 cent to 
130 cents lower with august at 4552 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were 85 cent to the limit 2 cents lower with august at 
3680 cents a pound 
on the new york mercantile exchange west texas intermediate 
crude oil settled 33 cents to 40 cents lower with september at 
1605 a barrel heating oil was 78 cent to 92 cent lower with

the federal communications commission has 
indicated it may fine us sprint communications co unless the 
longdistance phone company does a better job responding to 
consumer billing complaints 
customer complaints about inaccurate incomplete and late bills 
have plagued the nations thirdlargest longdistance company since 
it was formed in july 1986 and have contributed to its losses 
in a letter last week to us sprint president robert h snedaker 
the fcc said it was concerned about the volume of billing 
complaints it has received from us sprint customers and the 
companys inadequate and inaccurate responses 
while other carriers have experienced billing complaints they 
usually correct the problem within two to three months said the 
letter signed by gerald brock the fccs top telephone official 
in us sprints case however various billing and related 
problems have been occurring for well over a year brock said 
these problems have been compounded by us sprints apparent 
inability to promptly rectify complaints either when a customer 
directly contacts us sprint or when the customer contacts the 
commission 
the fcc gave sprint 20 days to explain the procedures it has in 
place to investigate complaints forwarded by the fcc and what steps 
it intends to respond to these complaints within the 30 days 
required by law 
us sprint officials had no comment monday on the letter 
previously the company has blamed the billing errors on computer 
problems and has said it was bringing the foulups under control 
greg vogt chief of the fccs telephone enforcement unit said 
the agency received 1821 complaints against sprint between oct 1 
1986 and july 14 but said we would be seeing the tip of the 
iceberg of what sprint sees in complaints directly from customers 
during the same period the fcc received 1114 complaints 
against american telephone amp telegraph co and 494 against mci 
communications corp he said 
atampt the nations largest longdistance company says it serves 
about 70 percent of the interstate longdistance market while mci 
claims about 10 percent and sprint about 6 percent 
vogt said the fcc if not satisfied with sprints efforts to 
make timely responses to complaints could fine the company as much 
as 2000 per violation up to a total of 20000 
last week gte corp announced it was selling most of its 50 
percent stake in us sprint to its partner in the venture united 
telecommunications inc united telecom will raise its stake in us 
sprint to 801 percent early next year 
us sprint lost 138 million in the first quarter of 1988 after 
racking up losses of 800 million last year the two parents have 
shared those losses equally
