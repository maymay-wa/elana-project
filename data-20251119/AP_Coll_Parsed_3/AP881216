they are pulled from dirty pockets tattered and 
scribbled upon then consulted like road maps to the compassionate 
heart of the city want a free meal medical care counseling a 
place to sober up 
for the homeless in new york city the answers can be found in 
street sheets a sort of yellow pages for the downandout 
all but unknown to most new yorkers street sheets have become an 
institution among the homeless since their introduction in the 
autumn of 1986 the singlesheet listings printed on durable 
nonrip paper are treasured memorized copied and passed from hand 
to hand in shelters soup kitchens and street corners around the 
city 
theyre legendary said bill batson who runs the grand 
central food program for the coalition for the homeless the 
people that i know that are surviving the best and seem like they 
have the best chance of improving themselves are equipped with 
street sheets 
from an initial printing of 6300 and listings covering one 
neighborhood of manhattan street sheets have grown to a planned 
circulation of 70000 this year with listings covering all of 
manhattan and the south bronx at a cost of 35000 the 1989 
manhattan listings will hit the streets this weekend 
street sheets are the work of suzanne firtko 45 an 
architectural historian who got the idea while working as a 
volunteer in a soup kitchen at the cathedral of st john the divine 
customers continually asked for names of other places to get free 
meals or other assistance i began to find that this was very 
difficult information to find that there was no organized way to 
find out where they can go ms firtko recalled in an interview 
so she began to collect information relying on tips from 
homeless people and her own investigations until she had a list of 
54 places on manhattans upper west side that offered help to the 
homeless 
then she applied her own criteria visited each place and 
eliminated all but 26 
ms firtko excluded any place that required a referral from a 
social service agency a common stipulation among providers of care 
to the homeless the referral process she said is stressful and 
difficult for many homeless people she wanted places that were no 
hassle 
the first batch of street sheets providing listings for the 
upper west side only were snapped up in five days ms firtko said 
paper for the listings was provided by the dupont corp money for 
printing came from a private benefactor 
after a second printing of the upper west side list ms firtko 
came out with a separate list for harlem then last december after 
incorporating as a nonprofit organization and receiving 
contributions from foundations and corporations she expanded street 
sheets to include editions for the east side the lower east side 
and the chelseaclinton neighborhood 
last years printing run was 60000 and demand for the listings 
was overwhelming ms firtko said estimates of the number of 
homeless in the city vary the coalition for the homeless says there 
are 60000 to 80000 while city officials say they provide shelter 
to about 27000 and cannot guess how many others have no home 
street sheets which are designed to be useful even for those who 
cant read list services beneath symbols for hot food pantries 
clothes and help 
pantries distribute groceries to those in welfare hotels the 
help category includes legal aid health care dental care and 
drug and alcohol detoxification centers 
most of the listings are for private services many of them run 
by churches you could use the street sheet to totally circumvent 
the welfare system and the cityrun shelter system ms firtko 
said 
although she is critical of city services for the homeless the 
feelings are apparently not mutual mayor edward koch gave ms 
firtko one of his mayors voluntary service awards earlier this year 
ms firtko also hears from homeless people who offer thanks and 
suggestions for street sheets 
among the likely recipients of the latest printing will be a man 
who calls himself eli sitting at a table inside a manhattan 
building atrium last week he reached into a pocket and pulled out a 
handful of old street sheets 
he has no need for them anymore hes memorized them i just 
keep them around in case i meet someone whos new to the street 
eli explained ill give them one help them out 
still he and his partner jay doublechecked the street sheet 
for the address of a nearby soupkitchen just to make sure then 
they headed back onto the street a hot meal a few blocks away

a man who wounded six police officers in a wild 
shootout that triggered a national manhunt was sentenced thursday to 
five to 15 years on weapons charges stemming from the gun battle 
larry davis 22 was acquitted of nine counts of attempted murder 
in the 1986 gunfight with police in the bronx eliciting a firestorm 
of criticism from politicians and elected officials 
a defiant davis was ringed by eight court officers when the 
sentence was handed down 
earlier he had questioned the integrity of acting state supreme 
court justice bernard fried and during a 15minute speech he 
called fried his persecutor and said you have violated the law 
several times 
i believe you have tried to pretry my case even though you 
are supposed to be neutral he told the judge 
davis attorney william kunstler called it a racist 
sentence and immediately appealed it davis must serve at least 
five years before parole 
davis opened his comments by thanking allah his family friends 
supporters and attorneys he rolled up his shirtsleeve and pants leg 
to show injuries allegedly inflicted by corrections officers 
i am not some racist brutal beast or killer that the drug 
trafficking police are trying to paint me as he said i 
challenge you to give me the same sentence as you would give your 
own son 
fried sat impassively during davis speech but called him a 
violent gun carrying drug dealer as he gave him five to 15 
years concurrent on each of two counts of criminal possession of a 
weapon with intent to use and 1 23 to five years on three counts 
of weapons possession to run concurrent with the five to 15 year 
term 
fried threw out one weapons conviction because of a legal 
technicality 
dozens of davis supporters attended the hearing as did several 
of the officers shot by davis including detective thomas mccarren 
who had labeled the verdict acquitting davis as racist 
before sentencing mccarren told fried he believed davis was a 
coldblooded killer with no character 
davis was found innocent of the attempted murder counts and six 
counts of aggravated assault on nov 20 by a bronx state supreme 
court jury his second acquittal in nine months 
regardless of the sentence handed down thursday davis will 
likely remain in custody pending two more trials fried could have 
given davis a maximum of 10 to 20 years on the charges 
kunstler had suggested his client should receive no time or the 
same sentence as bernhard goetz six months goetz was acquitted of 
attempted murder but convicted on weapons charges for the shooting 
of four teens on a manhattan subway train 
the trial focused on the nov 19 1986 shootout between police 
and davis in his sisters bronx apartment six officers were wounded 
in the exchange davis escaped unscathed through an adjoining 
apartments window setting off a 17day national manhunt 
kunstler argued that the police without a warrant came to the 
apartment intent on killing davis who fired in selfdefense when 
the officers opened fire on him without provocation 
prosecutors contended davis fired first as he resisted arrest by 
police seeking him as a suspect in the slayings of four suspected 
drug dealers davis was acquitted of murder charges in that case on 
march 3 
mayor edward i koch and police commissioner benjamin ward had 
denounced the jury verdict in the second davis trial in the days 
following his acquittal 
prior to the sentencing about 1500 city police officers 
incensed by the david verdict turned out in front of the bronx 
county courthouse to call for the maximum jail time 
davis still faces a murder charge in manhattan and another in the 
bronx as well as charges of kidnapping and assault in the bronx and 
car theft on long island

sten andersson smiled at the television in his 
hotel suite when it carried the news that ended months of secret 
meetings and lastminute quibbles over words in two languages not 
his own 
the swedish foreign minister guided the diplomacy culminating in 
the us agreement to talk to the plo which secretary of state 
george p shultz announced wednesday night 
swedens effort to bring the united states and the palestine 
liberation organization together began on a trip andersson made to 
the middle east in march during that visit he saw the palestinian 
uprising now a year old against israeli rule in the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip 
i met with about 100 boys shot by israeli soldiers some of 
them paralyzed for life he told reporters thursday 
the 64yearold swedish diplomat went to jordan after israel and 
talks with two plo leaders convinced him they wanted a separate 
palestinian state rather than the destruction of israel palestinians 
had preached for decades 
egyptians saudi arabians and envoys from several european 
nations were involved in negotiations that followed andersson said 
he met with vernon a walters washingtons ambassador to the united 
nations and hinted to the journalists of contacts with shultz 
he said sweden acted as a postman delivering messages but 
added i confess we have written some of the letters too 
eugene makhlouf plo delegate to stockholm said the swedes did 
most of the diplomatic maneuvering they worked very hard until we 
achieved this result he said just after the shultz announcement 
andersson described his role to a few reporters early thursday 
morning and at a crowded news conference later he told the news 
conference he approached american jews not israelis because he did 
not want the israeli government to know about his activities in 
advance 
the most crucial event was the meeting with the jewish 
personalities from the united states attended by khalid elhassan 
of the plo a fortnight before plo chairman yasser arafat came 
to stockholm andersson said 
rita hauser a prominent member of the republican party led the 
american jewish delegation at the secret meeting elhassan is a 
leading figure in the plo and a confidant of arafat 
after the meeting the foreign minister said he wrote a document 
expressing the agreements reached and both sides agreed to sign it 
the document was not made public until last week when arafat 
visited stockholm to meet with ms hauser and other american jews 
most of the meeting with arafat dealt with strategy for 
persuading the us government to deal with the plo 
anderssons last maneuvers were performed wednesday afternoon 
when he settled arguments over which words in english and arabic the 
united states would accept in arafats announcement that he 
renounced terrorism and accepted israels right to exist 
on tuesday us officials had said a speech by arafat to the 
un general assembly in geneva did not meet american conditions for 
contacts with the plo 
that speech and his statement wednesday seemed much the same but 
andersson said arafats remarks at the news conference in english 
cleared up questions of language that had disturbed the americans 
he said all the ideas expressed wednesday were in arafats speech 
in arabic a day earlier but were split up and in different 
words 
arabs have a different way of making speeches than americans the 
swedish diplomat observed they use a lot of words a lot of words 
always cause confusion misunderstanding if he arafat changes 
the words the americans say whats going on here 
arafat said in the speech for instance that he condemned 
terrorism and at the news conference that he renounced it 
makhlouf said one word covers for both concepts in arabic the 
plo representative added that another element contributed to the 
delay in a favorable response from washington they didnt believe 
their ears yesterday tuesday they needed to hear it again 
andersson whose diplomatic involvement with the arabisraeli 
conflict covers 25 years said he felt the us decision was an 
important step in breaking the middle east stalemate 
the beginning of peace is always dialogue but it has a long 
way to go he said

automakers insurance companies contractors 
and the oil industry are trying to make a preemptive strike against 
raising the gasoline tax to cut the federal budget deficit 
the highway lobby presented its arguments at a news conference 
thursday saying such a tax increase would be unfair to the poor and 
to residents of rural areas it also claimed that an increase would 
soak up money needed to repair the nations highways and bridges 
the news conference was sponsored by the road information 
project which is financed by companies with a vested interest in 
highways it presented four former federal highway administration 
chiefs to argue against reducing the deficit by raising the gas tax 
ray barnhart frank c turner norbert tiemann and john hassell 
all said any gastax increase needs to be earmarked to repair roads 
and bridges they cited estimates that 60 percent of the nations 
paved roads and 42 percent of its bridges are substandard 
some members of the national economic commission which was 
created to recommend ways to reduce the 155billion budget deficit 
have urged an increase of up to 50 cents in the gas tax rep dan 
rostenkowski dill chairman of the house ways and means 
committee has said he could support an increase of 10 or 15 cents 
if presidentelect bush should propose it 
but bush has said repeatedly he opposes any tax increase to cut 
the deficit and he specifically rejects boosting the gas tax 
virtually all the tax now 91 cents a gallon is earmarked for 
highways bridges and mass transit none goes into the fund that 
pays for general government services 
each onecent increase in the gasoline tax would raise about 1 
billion although economists say a major boost in the tax likely 
would produce a smaller pergallon payoff because people would drive 
less

more than 3 percent of the nations hospitals 
had death rates among their medicare patients last year that 
exceeded federal projections 
a little more than 6 percent of hospitals had 
lowerthanprojected mortality rates 
the annual report card of nearly 6000 hospitals issued thursday 
by the health care financing administration found that 188 hospitals 
had an overall mortality rate that exceeded the range predicted by 
the agencys elaborate computer model 
although the data that goes into the report is based on about 10 
million hospital admissions hcfa officials cautioned that the final 
product should not be taken as the sole basis for judging the 
quality of care at a particular hospital 
in particular dr william c roper said exclusion of a 
severity of illness measure for each admission could result in 
some inner city public hospitals looking worse in the report than 
they really are 
but on balance he insisted that a small validation study in 
which researchers used data from the medical records of 44000 cases 
confirms the fundamental soundness of the methodology used to 
produce the massive report 
the lack of a further severity of illness screen is not a major 
problem said roper 
the 188 hospitals with mortality rates above projections in 1987 
represented 32 percent of the total in 1986 the comparable 
figures were 175 and 3 percent 
seventyfive hospitals had higherthanprojected rates for both 
years 
at the other end of the scale 62 percent of the hospitals were 
low outliers in 1987 meaning their mortality rates were lower 
than projected that compared with 58 percent in this category for 
1986 
even though the report contains specific figures for each 
hospital hcfa officials did not identify those with mortality rates 
above or below projected levels 
intended primarily for community use copies of the reports were 
made available by hcfa to public and private state health 
organizations state news media outlets and elderly advocacy 
organizations such as the 25million member american association of 
retired persons 
roper has been criticized on the one hand for releasing the data 
at all and on the other for organizing it in a way that makes it 
impossible to use as a simplistic way to rank hospitals 
at a news conference thursday he said he is more convinced than 
ever that the report is a valid tool for improving the quality of 
the american health care system 
i am confident it has had a profound impact on focusing 
attention on the actual care that is delivered in hospitals he 
said there are hospitals today that are not doing things they 
were doing formerly but were not doing well patients have a better 
vehicle for making decisions about the questions they pose and where 
they go for care

every time a space shuttle goes up its fuel 
tank costing tens of millions of dollars breaks into little pieces 
and falls into the ocean now nasa and a group of universities are 
teaming up to stop the waste 
the space agency and the university corporation for atmospheric 
research announced an agreement thursday to make scientific use of 
the tanks once the shuttle is in orbit 
the fuel tanks which cost 34 million each are the only part of 
the shuttle system that is not reused the orbiter goes up like a 
rocket and comes down like an airplane the two booster rockets are 
retrieved by waiting ships and towed back into port for 
refurbishment 
the nasaucar agreement calls for placing experiments and 
equipment into five selected shuttle tanks probably beginning in 
1991 the experiments will be placed on a pallet in an unpressurized 
5000cubicfoot area between the inner fuel and oxidizer tanks 
we are not costing the taxpayer one bit said peter riva an 
adviser to the university group we are reimbursing nasa for all 
costs 
the group a consortium of 58 universities and research 
institutions involved in atmospheric and space science research 
eventually hopes to use the spent tanks in orbit the experiments on 
the first five will be conducted on suborbital flights in the 
minutes after the tanks are released from the orbiter and fall back 
through the atmosphere into the indian ocean 
all that highdensity aluminum is being discarded riva said 
it is a far better idea to leave them in orbit to use now or 
eventually as platforms and habitats and all sorts of things in 
space 
the national aeronautics and space administration uses a small 
explosive device to start the tanks tumbling after release so they 
will break into small pieces that burn up in the atmosphere 
the first experiments will aim at controlling the tanks during 
their fall thats crucial to us riva said we will put on 
board some small form of rocket controlled from the ground and try 
preliminary roll and yaw experiments on the external tank 
other experiments will measure the density of the atmosphere and 
release gases at high altitude to measure their effect a step 
toward monitoring the decay of the environment 
riva said the consortium envisions a budget of 500 million and 
will try to recoup some of that by renting space on the pallet to 
other experiments no operational changes will be made in the 
shuttle operations and no timetable for flights has been set 
we are not going to cause a single hiccup in nasas normal 
shuttle operation riva said 
nasa said several organizations have proposed private uses for 
the tanks and that evaluation of the proposals continues 
the 154footlong external tank holds the nearly 16 million 
pounds of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen fuel that is required to 
power the shuttle to orbit the intertank area is 270 inches long 
331 inches in diameter and weighs 12100 pounds

establishment of a palestinian state is more 
possible now that the united states is talking to the plo and 
inching toward support of a seat for yasser arafats organization in 
mideast peace talks 
for several reasons the plo chairman is being vague about where 
the state would be set up arafat said in geneva his state would 
exist alongside israel but he has not said whether the palestine he 
envisions would cut deeper into the jewish state 
clearly he wants to take control of the west bank and gaza held 
by israel since 1967 and the home of 12 million palestinian arabs 
and 60000 jews and without question he wants part of jerusalem 
the israeli capital 
but what about a corridor to the mediterranean sea or other land 
the plo chairman has called for implementation of the l947 
partition resolution for instance that would shrink israel into a 
smaller country than it was before the 1967 middle east war when it 
took the west bank and gaza from its arab neighbors 
also arafat insists on the right of palestinians to return to 
their ancestral homes 
at the very least that would change the composition of israel 
if not its boundaries 
palestinian aspirations are behind these designs of course and 
not everyone would agree with secretary of state george p shultz 
that arafat is now ready to live in peace with israel the more he 
can squeeze the country the weaker it would be 
besides a palestinian state confined to the west bank and gaza 
might not be economically viable 
that was one of the arguments used this year by shultz in 
explaining on four unsuccessful trips to the middle east why he did 
not back establishment of a palestinian state 
now arafat can use the same argument to expand his territorial 
ambitions 
for one thing israel stands between gaza on the mediterranean 
and the west bank dividing the residents of the two territories 
also the areas are basically agricultural lack oil and industry 
and have no developed seaport the main resource is the talent and 
industry of the palestinians 
the reagan administration like its predecessors pressed for a 
reabsorption by jordan of most of the west bank in some undefined 
way the aspirations of the palestinians was supposed to be worked 
out through jordan with israels concurrence 
but arafat has never relented in his demand for a separate and 
independent state while all the arab leaders including king hussein 
of jordan have supported him in the quest 
so long as the united states shunned the palestine liberation 
organization and opposed a plo seat in the negotiations as well as a 
palestinian state the debate was mostly academic 
but now that president reagan and shultz have ordered us talks 
with the plo the statehood question takes on new urgency 
even if israel stands fast the way is cleared for arafat to push 
his demands and to insist on a seat at the table and more than an 
amorphous entity on the west bank and in gaza 
on thursday state department spokesman charles e redman 
struggled with the problem and left the impression us policy on 
plo participation in peace talks was in flux 
the palestinians have the right to pursue their desire for an 
independent state through negotiations he said 
but he was evasive when asked if it was still the us position 
that palestinians should be part of a joint delegation with jordan 
and not have a seat of their own redmans response was i dont 
rule out or in any particular option 
that could indicate that another plank of the us policy on the 
plo was being removed but redman leaned in the other direction when 
he was pressed further 
he said we would be perfectly happy if all of the parties 
agreed on a joint delegation of jordanians and palestinians with 
the plo not being part of it 
told by a reporter that did not represent a change in us 
policy redman agreed absolutely totally and fully

the agriculture department has resolved that 
the new year will bring an end to a fiveyear rulemaking snag 
involving food safety and the processing of oldfashioned country 
ham 
the deadline for ham producers to comply with new federal 
regulations was supposed to be dec 31 but it has been pushed back 
to the final day of 1989 the deadline once was dec 31 1987 and 
before that it was dec 31 1986 there also was one on aug 6 1985 
now the departments food safety and inspection service says it 
will stick to a deadline of dec 31 1989 or whenever the agency 
finally approves the new rules spokeswoman irene goins said 
thursday 
the lengthy rulemaking procedure involves those hams often seen 
on grocery shelves in cloth bags or hanging from rafters in country 
stores they must be scrubbed to remove mold and then soaked or 
boiled a couple of times to reduce the salt content 
theyre the kind of hams for which someone had to invent redeye 
gravy and in some parts of the country grits 
as the usda defines them theyre uncooked cured dried 
smoked or unsmoked pork products made from solid meat 
typically country or drycured hams are treated with salt and 
then put in a smokehouse to cure and age a total process that can 
take months or even years 
most hams sold in supermarkets are wetcured quickly in brine 
solutions and cooked before sale to consumers 
in march 1983 the usda proposed rules intended to help prevent 
trichinosis a disease caused by microscopic parasitic worms or 
trichinae that can occur in improperly cooked pork the proposed 
rules were directed at readytoeat pork products and drycured 
country hams 
shortly after the original proposal was adopted feb 6 1985 the 
agency learned that some federally inspected ham producers were 
using oldfashioned methods that didnt meet the new usda 
requirements and were ordered to show by aug 6 1985 that their 
curing procedures were safe 
the country ham industry protested so the usda allowed more 
time one compelling reason for the extensions of time for 
compliance was that no trichina problems had been associated with 
the drycured hams 
these traditional processing methods have been permitted 
because they are decadesold methods believed to be effective in 
destroying trichinae says ronald j prucha acting administrator 
of the usda agency 
we are researching the safety of traditional trichina control 
methods and developing a proposed rule for issuance in early 1989 
he said after we receive public comments on that proposal we 
will develop new regulations 
but just in case the usdas rulemaking machine is slower than 
officials hope the compliance deadline was extended another full 
year

a 17 percent increase in the amount of raw 
sugar that can be imported from 39 foreign countries in 1989 has 
been announced by the agriculture department 
deputy secretary peter meyers said thursday that next years 
quota was set at about 124 million short tons of 2000 pounds each 
up from about 106 million tons in calendar 1988 
in metric tons which have about 2205 pounds each the 1989 
quota will be almost 113 million tons metric units were used to 
establish next years quota to meet the terms of a new us tariff

peanut farmers will be allowed a bigger 
government quota for their 1989 crop 
the agriculture department said thursday that the national peanut 
marketing quota for 1989 will be 144 million tons up 37800 tons 
from this years quota 
the national quota is required by law to be equal to the 
estimated quantity of peanuts that will be needed for domestic 
edible seed and related uses in the 198990 marketing year which 
will begin aug 1 1989 the quota cannot be less than 11 million 
tons 
officials said the 1989 poundage quota will be allocated to each 
producing state based on the states share of the 1988 quota 
increases in a states quota will be allocated among qualifying 
peanut farms 
peanut farmers voted in a referendum in january 1986 to continue 
quota for crops through 1990

the southwest african supreme 
court has overturned an order by south african president pw botha 
to halt the trial of four soldiers accused of fatally beating a 
black man according to news reports 
the supreme court in windhoek capital of the south 
africancontrolled territory also known as namibia ruled bothas 
1986 order halting the trial was invalid newspapers reported 
thursday 
botha had relied on a law that said if he determined members of 
the security forces were acting in good faith to combat terrorism 
they could not be tried for acts they committed 
but the court ruled wednesday that botha could not legally make 
such a decision because he did not receive the proper report about 
the case the court said the report signed by defense minister 
magnus malan was most misleading and that the investigator 
failed to talk to witnesses 
mweunhanga uapota wife of the dead man brought the appeal in 
her affidavit she said she her husband frans and some friends were 
gathered at a shop in onengali in northern namibia when soldiers 
appeared forced them to lie down kicked them blindfolded and 
assaulted her husband 
the court noted the defendants did not deny the allegations 
it also noted the postmortem report detailing uapotas 
injuries was not submitted to the president and he also was not 
given information showing uapota was never involved in terrorism 
the autopsy report said uapota died from massive bleeding on the 
brain caused by head injury it also said he had serious injuries 
to the upper abdomen and chest a broken neck and injuries 
consistent with a rope having been tied around the deceaseds 
neck

presidentelect bush is fed up with being 
peppered with questions while posing for pictures and says he wont 
let that happen during phototaking sessions after his inauguration 
talking at photo ops will continue until jan 20 and after that 
there will be absolutely none bush admonished reporters thursday 
he told the journalists his new press policy was for their own 
good because shouting questions during photo opportunities was 
demeaning to your profession 
there was no shouting during the session that sparked bushs 
edict just a reprise of the usual questions the vice president gets 
these days about when he will finish naming his cabinet 
earlier bush was asked about yasser arafat while he posed for 
posterity with italian prime minister ciriaco de mita 
while bush held few news conferences during the campaign he has 
faced reporters for extensive questioning repeatedly since the 
election turning each of his cabinet announcements into news 
conferences 
he also has been responding to questions at the picturetaking 
sessions in the white house with visiting dignitaries politicians 
or guests where a pool of 10 or 15 reporters photographers and 
camera crews are ushered in for the opening minute 
the photo opportunity at times has been the white house press 
corps main avenue of communication with president reagan who has 
held fewer news conferences than any modern president and who often 
seemed to enjoy firing off oneliners during these brief encounters 
with the press 
the reagan administration made an attempt to muzzle reporters 
during photoopportunity sessions but backed off when the 
television networks refused to send in their camera crews without 
their correspondents 
mary martin deputy washington bureau chief for cbs news said 
thursday night when information is needed were going to ask 
questions 
but she added if the vice president makes himself available to 
answer questions at other times it becomes less necessary to pursue 
your questions at photo opportunities 
that may be what bush has in mind i hope that we can work out 
something thats satisfactory to all he said 
top aides have said they expect bush to have frequent short 
contacts with the news media possibly several times a week 
ill have other ways of communicating that will be much more 
pleasant for you and much more pleasant for me and much more 
respectful of our guests like foreign visitors bush told 
reporters 
asked if he would hold regular news conferences bush said oh 
sure therell be news conferences he said they would not be 
regular that idea went out years ago but frequent 
ones 
but not shouted questions he reiterated its demeaning to 
your profession you shouldnt have to yell at me to get an answer 
he said he would permit the shouted questions to continue during 
the transition because theres a certain fun i like the give and 
take of it its humility 
but he predicted that ending such situations will be a great 
relief to the photographers and to the serious reporters that 
would like answers and not have to yell over a helicopter 
someplace

psychological harm caused by the chernobyl 
nuclear accident is likely to outweigh the other health effects in 
the general population according to the author of a study published 
today 
marvin goldman a professor of radiobiology at the university of 
california davis says in his study that the increased risk of 
cancer from exposure to airborne radiation from chernobyl is almost 
too small to be measured for the 3 billion people in the northern 
hemisphere 
but the fear caused by the disaster was immense he said 
this was a major nuclear accident probably the worst you can 
imagine goldman said in an interview three billion people were 
terrorized 
there was just enough general understanding of the disaster to 
provoke fear but not enough to give reassurance he said 
goldman said the fear sprang from knowing that the stuff is 
radiation knowing that its invisible knowing that the major 
consequence is cancer the soviets have a word for it they call it 
radiophobia theyve had a tremendous problem in overcoming this 
the increased cancer risk pales in comparison he said 
the chernobyl accident was equal to about three years of 
background radiation to the population of the northern hemisphere 
goldman said 
the net effect for the 3 billion people in the hemisphere is an 
increase in the lifetime chance of dying of cancer of about 0003 
percent he said 
for europeans who were closer to the accident he said 
chernobyl increased cancer risk by about 002 percent an increase 
not worth losing any sleep over 
we each walk around with about a 20 percent fatal cancer 
risk said goldman for those with a 002 percent risk 
increase it means that instead of a 20 percent risk it is now 
2002 percent 
he said natural radiation will cause about 500000 people of the 
3 billion now living in the northern hemisphere to die of cancer 
the risk estimate added by chernobyl is calculated to cause an 
additional 17000 deaths he said 
you couldnt see a number like 17000 among the 500 million 
cancer deaths he said there is no way that such a small 
increase could ever be demonstrated epidemiologically 
the chernobyl plant in the soviet union near the city of kiev 
exploded and burned on april 26 1986 it spawned a cloud of 
radioactive material that swept in a cloud around the globe the 
most immediate effect was near the plant where there were 237 cases 
of acute radiation sickness including 31 deaths 
public concern elsewhere was heightened by the problem of whom to 
believe which are the real facts and which arent he said 
some governments in europe overreacted despite the existence of 
detailed plans prepared in advance goldman said 
as the pressure mounted and press attention grew all the 
numbers and preparations just went out the window some governments 
took action just to appear to be doing something about it 
in many cases food and crops were destroyed unnecessarily he 
said and some individual reactions were hysterical 
goldman said a german woman called him to ask if she should shoot 
her race horse out of fear that the animal would not be able to 
breed properly 
the professor said he reassured her and the horse was spared 
the study coauthored by goldman on the chernobyl accident is 
published today in science the journal of the american association 
for the advancement of science the other authors were lynn r 
anspaugh of the lawrence livermore national laboratory in livermore 
calif and robert j catlin of electric power institute in palo

the security council has extended the un 
peacekeeping mission on cyprus for six months and expressed hope 
rival turkish and greek cypriot communities will resolve their 
conflict by june 
after the council voted 150 on thursday to extend the mandate of 
the un peacekeeping force in cyprus representatives of greece 
turkey and the greek and turkish cypriot communities debated anew 
who began the conflict 
turkish cypriot representative ozer koray accused greece and the 
greek cypriot community of importing arms from greece and also 
setting up weaponry plants 
cypriot ambassador constantine moushoutas speaking for greek 
cypriots blamed the crisis on the turkish invasion and 
occupation he noted past security council resolutions call for 
withdrawing all foreign troops and settlers from the island 
in 1974 a coup by greeces ruling military junta failed on the 
island turkey invaded the northern part of cyprus saying it was 
protecting the minority turkish cypriot community and sent 
thousands of turks to settle in the north 
turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash in 1975 proclaimed the 
northern part of the island an independent turkish state but the 
only diplomatic recognition it has won is from turkey 
cypriot president george vassiliou who leads the greek 
community and denktash have held a series of talks aimed at setting 
up a republic containing both communities 
the talks have been deadlocked another round is scheduled to 
begin monday 
the un peacekeepers on cyprus are funded by voluntary 
contributions from un member states but a report to the council 
by secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said donations have not 
been coming in

a recommended halt to the governments let it 
burn forest fire policy probably would be over by the start of the 
western fire season next spring according to the cochairman of a 
panel that suggested the moratorium 
the panel in recommendations thursday to the secretaries of 
agriculture and interior said there were environmental benefits to 
allowing fires in national parks and wilderness areas to burn 
experts say fire renews forests giving new species a chance to 
grow encouraging wildlife and recycling nutrients 
but it also said that in some cases the social and economic 
effects of allowing a forest fire to burn may be unacceptable 
the panel suggested a temporary halt to the let it burn 
policy saying the forest service and the national park service 
needed more time to refine their fire management plans 
my guess is that the moratorium would be finished by the 
beginning of the western fire season which is the middle of may 
charles philpot cochairman of the review panel told a news 
conference 
the panel was assembled last september after the worst fire 
season ever in droughtprimed yellowstone national park some 249 
fires seared 706278 acres within the park boundaries and 40 percent 
as much again in nearby national forests 
residents in the fire vicinity complained bitterly that the park 
tourism and the very air they breathed were being ruined by the 
failure to control the fires 
the review team was asked to look at policies throughout the 
national parks and wilderness areas not just yellowstone however 
it did not consider policies in other areas such as ordinary 
national forests where the forest service tries to protect 
commercial timbering operations 
the panels report will remain open for public comment for 60 
days before any recommendations are adopted 
the report said no fires in national parks and wilderness areas 
should be allowed to burn until government fire management plans are 
improved and strengthened 
it said actual fire management plans often have not spelled out 
when natural fires would be allowed to burn and when they would be 
put out 
the agencies involved should make sure that fire management plans 
conform to departmental policies that employees understand the 
policies that everybody is using a common vocabulary and that 
agencies have agreed beforehand what to do if fires threaten to move 
across administrative boundaries the report said 
no natural fires are to be allowed until fire management 
plans meet these standards the report said 
plans should consider the effects of prolonged drought fuel 
moisture content and the possibility that multiple fires will tie up 
firefighting resources the report said 
another recommendation called for the responsible agency official 
to certify in writing daily that adequate resources are available 
to ensure that every natural fire will be kept within boundaries 
set by government authorities

increased awareness of drinking problems and 
tougher drunkdriving laws and enforcement are most likely 
responsible for a decline in the proportion of fatal crashes related 
to alcohol us health officials said 
even so more than half of last years 46386 traffic fatalities 
died in accidents involving alcohol indicating the problem of 
drunken driving remains a serious one the national centers for 
disease control reported thursday 
this is one of those problems that has been going on for a long 
time in the united states said dr richard waxweiler chief of 
the epidemiology branch at the cdcs division of injury epidemiology 
and control 
its not like some new disease or epidemic that grabs 
everybodys attention 
in 1987 23632 people were killed in the united states in motor 
vehicle crashes in which alcohol was involved or 51 percent of all 
us traffic fatalities the cdc said that compares with 25165 
killed in 1982 in alcoholrelated crashes or 57 percent of the 
43945 traffic fatalities that year 
the number of deaths in accidents in which no one had been 
drinking rose from 18780 or 43 percent in 1982 to 22754 or 49 
percent in 1987 conversely the deaths in the most strongly 
alcoholrelated accidents those in which at least one party tested 
above 10 on a bloodalcohol test declined from 20356 or 46 
percent in 1982 to 18529 or 40 percent in 1987 according to 
statistics from the nhtsa data 
the proportion of alcoholrelated traffic fatalities may have 
fallen the cdc said because of three factors increased public 
awareness of the problem enactment of more stringent laws and 
increased enforcement and laws that raised the drinking age to 
21 in all states 
although exact figures were not presented the cdc noted that the 
proportion of drivers intoxicated at the time of a fatal crash fell 
17 percent from 1982 to 1987 and the proportion of teenage drunken 
drivers involved in fatal crashes fell 34 percent

studies at two california laboratories suggest 
that genetically altered cells may help limit the growth of some 
cancers and help correct brain disorders such as alzheimers disease 
the experiments in two laboratories at the university of 
california san diego involved the use of cells that were 
genetically altered and then injected or grafted into laboratory 
animals according to reports published today 
in a study of cancer wenhwa lee a professor of pathology at 
ucsd said a cancersuppressing gene was inserted into the altered 
genetic pattern of a retrovirus a type of virus that controls the 
genetic pattern of a normal cell 
the retrovirus carrying the cancersuppressing retinoblastoma 
gene or rb was then transplanted into cancer cells 
to serve as a comparison another type of gene called 
luciferase or lux was processed in the same way 
lee said both types of altered cancer cells then were injected 
into nude mice a type of laboratory rodent that lacks an immune 
system and is highly susceptible to developing cancer each of seven 
mice received both kinds of the altered cells one type in each rear 
flank he said 
after a month the flanks injected with the luxinfected cells 
developed tumors lee said no tumors however grew on the flanks 
that had received the rbinfected cells 
it appears that the virus carrying the cancersuppressing gene is 
able to prevent the formation of malignant cells lee said it 
suggests that this technique could be used to genetically convert 
malignant tumor cells which grow very rapidly to cells that grow 
normally he said 
after the tumor cell received this virus said lee the 
tumor cell would lose its malignancy therefore it would stop 
growing or phase into a normal cell 
he said this holds promise for development withi five years of a 
novel strategy for the treatment of malignancy 
lee said cells receiving the rb gene would be blocked permanently 
from turning into cancer and that the virus carrying the gene could 
contribute this turmor suppression to other cells 
he said the technique using the rb gene theoretically could work 
in treatment of breast bone and lung cancer and a rare type of eye 
cancer in children the absence of the rb gene has been linked to 
all these types of cancers 
in another ucsd experiment theodore friedmann professor of 
pediatrics said he and a group of researchers grafted genetically 
altered cells into the brains of rats to produce a special protein 
called nerve growth factor that prevented damaged brain tissue from 
dying 
the work he said is the first demonstration of this sort of 
combination of genetic modification of cells and grafting as an 
approach to central nervous system disease 
friedmann said the researchers disarmed a retrovirus by removing 
part of its genetic pattern a gene that carries instructions for 
the production of nerve growth factor was then put into the pattern 
of the retrovirus 
next the team put the altered retrovirus into cells called 
fibroblasts these fibroblasts now had the genetic instructions for 
producing nerve growth factor 
the scientists then made surgical lesions in the brains of 16 
rats cutting the connection between the forebrain and the 
hippocampus normally this would cause the degeneration of 
cholinergic cells a type of brain tissue that requires the 
nourishment of nerve growth factor 
eight of the rats received brain grafts containing fibroblasts 
altered to produce nerve growth factor the other rats received 
grafts of unaltered fibroblasts 
after two weeks both groups of rats were killed and autopsied 
friedmann said the rats that received the unaltered fibroblasts 
experienced a loss of 51 percent of their cholinergic cells but the 
rats that had received the fibroblasts carrying the nerve growth 
factor gene lost only 8 percent of their cholinergic cells 
he said the importance of the study is that it demonstrates that 
brain conditions caused by a shortage of certain proteins could 
perhaps be corrected by grafting genetically altered cells that 
produce this protein 
you would have this little factory close to the lesion which is 
pouring out the material in a stable permanent way friedmann 
said 
the longrange implications from this study he said is that 
one can start thinking about treating diseases that are a result 
of gene defects in the brain at the level of the gene defect 
among the disorders that may one day benefit from this type of 
therapy he said are alzheimers disease some types of mental 
retardation and cerebral palsy and genetically based degeneration 
diseases 
both studies were published today in science the journal of the 
american association for the advancement of science

defense secretary frank c carlucci has killed 
a white house proposal to charge military dependents and retirees a 
fee for health care sources said 
the sources who spoke thursday on condition they not be 
identified said carlucci had intervened personally with officials 
at the office of management and budget to scuttle the idea 
omb is backing down one ranking pentagon official said 
this plan will be scrapped 
the pentagons chief spokesman dan howard declined to say 
thursday whether omb had agreed to discard the plan but howard made 
it clear that carlucci had fought the budget office over the matter 
the secretary understands that the military member and his 
family count medical care in the system as one of their most 
important fundamental benefits howard said 
an increase and change in charging fees to our service 
personnel would constitute a decrease in their net pay and benefits 
package and changing this benefit would be a breach of faith with 
our military service members their families and our retirees and 
have a negative effect on attracting and retaining quality 
personnel 
earlier this week defense officials disclosed that omb was 
pressing the pentagon to begin levying user fees starting next oct 
1 the sources who claimed pentagon officials were going 
bananas over the prospect of the user fees said the plan was 
advanced by omb for inclusion in the defense departments fiscal 
1990 budget proposal the budget is scheduled to be submitted to 
congress on jan 9 
under the plan military dependents and retirees would have been 
charged 10 for every outpatient doctor visit up to an annual 
ceiling of 100 3 to have prescriptions filled and 50 for 
admission to a military hospital 
men and women on active duty would not have been affected nor 
would the dependents of enlisted personnel in the bottom four 
enlisted ranks 
in addition the plan called for a doubling of the annual 
insurance deductible for dependents and retirees who turn to private 
physicians instead of using military facilities the socalled 
champus insurance deductibles would have increased from 50 to 100 
for individuals and 100 to 200 for families 
currently military dependents and retirees are allowed to use 
military hospitals on a space available basis with activeduty 
personnel always having priority but when a dependent or retiree is 
admitted to a hospital or uses other services the only fee he or 
she pays is a nominal subsistence fee for food while hospitalized

the energy department acknowledges it may not

17000 copies of a 23volume report on the superconducting super 
collider 
the action has alienated at least one house member already 
at a time when were looking for ways to reduce federal 
spending this is just absurd rep dennis hastert rill said 
thursday some federal bureaucrats just dont use common sense 
hastert whose district includes a rejected collider site 
suggested lawmakers who doubt energy secretary john herrington 
considered costs in picking texas to house the 44 billion atom 
smasher may be even more skeptical now 
i understand where the argument is coming from department 
spokesman jeff sherwood said i dont know who made the ultimate 
decision but if we hadnt distributed the report we would have 
been criticized for that as well 
at issue is an 8000page environmental impact statement on 
proposed collider sites in arizona colorado illinois michigan 
north carolina tennessee and texas 
the department sent copies of the statement to everyone who 
testified at hearings on the project or submitted written comments 
on any of the finalist sites sherwood said

the life expectancy for blacks has dropped for 
two consecutive years for the first time since 1970 when mortality 
data was first broken down by race according to a federal report 
while the white population experienced an increase in life 
expectancy to a record high of 754 years from 1985 to 1986 the 
black rate declined to 694 years the same level as in 1982 
despite that most recent twoyear decline the report notes that 
the largest gain in life expectancy between 1970 and 1986 was for 
both black males and females 52 years followed by white males 4 
years and white females 32 years 
the annual figures released recently by the national center for 
health statistics are derived from comparing us bureau of the 
census data with death certificates filed in the 50 states and 
district of columbia 
the 55page report makes no attempt at explaining any of the 
trends shown by the figures however the tables show there was a 15 
percent increase in homicides among blacks between 1985 and 1986 
compared to a 5 percent increase among whites

work out according to a new book on the vice presidentelect 
however the book by political scientist richard f fenno jr 
says quayle quickly matured when he moved to the senate in 1980 and 
risked alienating the republican administration to engineer passage 
of an important bipartisan job training bill 
the freshman republican senator was so irritated at roadblocks to 
the bill thrown up by labor department officials and thensecretary 
raymond donovan that he referred to them as the bastards the 
book says 
the making of a senator dan quayle is a sixyear study by

a woman physician who has been jailed for 16 
months for refusing to allow her exhusband to visit their daughter 
has lost a bid to be released 
superior court judge herbert b dixon said thursday that 
additional jail time may yet convince dr elizabeth morgan to change 
her position 
this court is convinced that the coercion has only begun 
dixon said as each day passes the waste of dr morgans personal 
and professional life becomes more apparent 
dixon jailed morgan on contempt of court charges in august 1987 
when she hid her then5yearold daughter hilary rather than allow 
her to go on a courtordered visit with her father northern 
virginia oral surgeon eric foretich morgan alleged that foretich 
had sexually abused hilary repeatedly in the past and would do so 
again 
morgans attorneys argued that because morgan firmly believed 
foretich would abuse the girl the coercive intent of jailing 
her clearly had failed 
dixon however noting that morgans plastic surgery practice has 
been closed said the personal costs of further incarceration might 
convince her to allow foretich visitation rights under one of 
several compromises issued by his attorney 
she has the opportunity to break this impasse but as time 
passes that opportunity may be lost dixon said she holds the 
keys to her freedom 
dixon said that at some undetermined future date he might free 
morgan if he concludes that the coercive intent of the contempt 
jailing has failed 
that could be in a month that could be in a year dixon 
said but it could be more than that 
morgan dressed in bright orange prison coveralls sat motionless 
as dixon read his ruling afterward she quietly thanked her 
attorneys before being led off by a us marshal 
i think what we saw here today is the ugly face of the law 
said stephen sachs one of morgans attorneys 
hilary remains hidden at an undisclosed location during the 
twoday hearing that preceded dixons ruling morgan rebuffed 
numerous questions about the child saying only that she was

but her plans were opposed by 11 neighbors in this new york city 
suburb and on wednesday night the north castle zoning board of 
appeals voted 32 to deny her request for permission to build the

the soviet union announced that col gen mikhail 
a moiseyev will be the new military chief of staff an appointment 
that appears to signal mikhail s gorbachevs desire to bring new 
faces into the red army leadership 
moiseyev 49 was appointed over several more senior officers and 
is the first military leader too young to have taken part in the 
soviet victory over nazi germany in world war ii 
his appointment to replace marshal sergei f akhromeyev was 
announced thursday in the defense ministry newspaper red star 
akhromeyevs retirement was announced by soviet officials in new 
york dec 7 the day gorbachev told the united nations he would 
unilaterally cut the soviet military 
that caused speculation the 65yearold akhromeyev was resigning 
in protest soviet officials denied this 
thursdays red star story was the first public announcement in 
the soviet union of akhromeyevs retirement 
moiseyevs previous post was as red army commander in the far 
east 
western diplomatic sources in moscow said little is known about 
moiseyev who now becomes a first deputy defense minister and the 
no 2 leader under defense minister dmitri t yazov 
one source said moiseyev was promoted to his present rank in 
november 1987 it may suggest to some of the oldtimers that its 
time to hang it up said the source who spoke on condition he not 
be identified 
moiseyevs areas of military expertise were not known and the 
diplomatic source said it was likely that since he has been serving 
in the far east the people on the general staff who will work for 
him dont know him either 
it was not known whether moiseyev was a protege of yazov but 
yazov also served as commander of the heavily fortified far east 
district before being named defense minister in may 1987 
yazov is known as a strong proponent of reforms in the soviet 
military in line with gorbachevs effort to restructure soviet 
society akhromeyev was one of the officials gorbachev passed over 
when yazov was named defense minister 
red star said akhromeyev was being transferred to another job in 
his announcement of akhromeyevs retirement last week the foreign 
ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said he would remain an 
adviser to gorbachev 
deputy foreign minister viktor karpov said at a news conference 
thursday that akhromeyevs retirement is in no way connected with 
the soviet troop reductions announced by mikhail gorbachev at the 
united nations 
born into a working class family in 1939 moiseyev joined the 
soviet army in 1958 and graduated from the frunze military academy 
and the military academy of the armed forces general staff

doses of a hybrid rathuman protein have helped 
two blood cancer patients eliminate the cancerous cells from their 
bodies according to a new report 
results also suggest the patients bodies did not try to reject 
the protein as foreign a concern with rat proteins used in other 
research scientists said 
the proteins are called monoclonal antibodies other research had 
already shown that a different kind of monoclonal antibodies could 
produce complete remissions in the blood cancer the two patients 
had called nonhodgkins lymphoma 
but the new strategy may avoid the costly and timeconsuming step 
of customdesigning antibodies for each patient wyndham wilson of 
the national cancer institute said thursday 
the new work is reported in saturdays issue of the british 
medical journal the lancet by scientists at the university of 
cambridge and the laboratory of molecular biology in cambridge 
england 
monoclonal antibodies seek out and bind to specific proteins on 
diseasecausing invaders in the bloodstream marking the germs for 
destruction by the bodys immune system scientists are studying 
ways to treat cancer by designing antibodies that will swarm onto 
cancerous targets 
one problem is that humandesigned antibodies cannot yet be 
generated in people the rodent antibodies scientists use instead 
can be recognized by the body as foreign provoking an attack by the 
immune system 
in the new work the researchers attempted to skirt that problem 
by making the hybrid antibodies through genetic engineering the 
combination antibodies appeared not to provoke any immune system 
attack but it is too early to draw overall conclusions about such 
antibodies researchers wrote 
they treated an elderly man and woman largely as outpatients 
the antibodies were designed to seek out a protein called the 
campath1 antigen which is found on the kind of normal cell that 
turns cancerous in lymphoma 
following treatments earlier this year neither patient showed 
any cancerous cells in the blood or bone marrow researchers said 
side effects during treatment included fever and rash 
more study is needed to see if the british technique will prove 
useful in therapy said stanford university researcher ronald levy 
patients will have to be followed longterm to see how long the 
remission lasts said levy who has produced complete remissions in 
the same disease with antibodies that seek proteins found on 
cancerous cells 
his treatment led to several remissions lasting longer than two 
years and one lasting six years he said thursday

one young american admitted shed forgotten what 
perestroika meant and the soviets misspelled their christmas 
cards but that didnt spoil the enthusiasm of 68 british us and 
soviet schoolchildren at a cookiesandcarols summit 
despite the kinks in protocol found at any international 
gathering at the end of their hourlong perestroika christmas on 
thursday the children were doing what summits aim to do making 
friends 
the only disgruntled faces in the elegant but narrow burlington 
arcade came from lunchhour shoppers oblivious to the diplomacy and 
irritated at the extra crowd 
we came to sing a song but mostly to meet the children thats 
the most important thing said lilly antonov one of four soviet 
teachers shepherding 26 charges from the soviet embassy school 
very many wanted to come and we had to choose those who could 
sing she said as her pack of 11 to 14yearolds waited for the 
late american arrivals from the american school in london 
its a bit surprising to see theyre a lot like us drew 
cortese of warren township nj said after he and 31 classmates 
trundled in 10 minutes behind schedule i was expecting they would 
look more different 
the americans wore jeans and buttons with slogans like only 
visiting this planet the soviets mostly girls in white blouses 
and blue skirts favored red scarves and lenin pins ten british 
students from peterborough st margarets high school for girls wore 
brown uniforms 
susan yehle of finley ohio said she had forgotten her 
teachers lesson on soviet reform but was excited at the chance to 
meet new friends 
arcade organizers billed the event as an opportunity for british 
and american children to introduce their soviet peers to christmas 
an idea not entirely new to the soviets 
we dont have any christmas but we have new years which is 
just like christmas said 12yearold katherine shevliecova 
explaining how rituals associated with the celebration of jesus 
birth have been transferred to nonreligious new years observances 
at the behest of the atheist soviet state 
for example popular lore has kept ded moroz or grandfather 
frost alive as a sort of soviet santa and many homes have a new 
years tree 
the soviet embassy refused to get involved said organizer ted 
jones of the arcade association but the school came through he 
said with an offer to sing a popular childrens song 
the american and british students marched in from opposite ends 
of the arcade singing christmas carols the soviets who were 
waiting for them in the middle passed out words to their antiwar 
song may there always be sunshine which they sang with 
choruses in russian and english 
nearby stood a table spread with cookies a turkey chocolate 
snowmen and oranges and red cross workers raising money for the 
armenian earthquake victims 
the children exchanged christmas cards with the soviets 
reading best wiches for merry christmas and happy new year and 
listened to grownups speeches before being let loose 
susan produced a 10 bill for a showandtell while others 
exchanged addresses

the fbi must explain why it has kept a 
classified file for six years on a high school senior who was 
investigated after writing to the soviet embassy for an encyclopedia 
project a judge says 
do all 11 or 12yearolds have to be fearful they will have to 
go through the same experience as todd patterson if they just write 
to a foreign government us district judge alfred m wolin asked 
thursday 
the agency has requested that wolin dismiss a lawsuit brought by 
the american civil liberties union on behalf of patterson who as a 
sixthgrader embarked on a social studies project that would teach 
him far more than he bargained for about the real world 
six years ago the youth wrote to foreign embassies asking for 
information about their countries to compile his own encyclopedia 
susan cassell the federal attorney representing the fbi said 
the return address of pattersons letters was that of his fathers 
company laboratory disposable products inc which probably helped 
arouse the fbis curiosity 
according to fbi affidavits the agency looked into the letters 
because one was going to the soviet embassy but once they found out 
they were from a boy they dropped the probe however they kept a 
file on him even after he called the fbi asking for advice when he 
was invited to visit the soviet mission 
patterson now 17 sued the government asking for parts of his 
file not already released under a freedom of information act 
request he also sought damages for invasion of his privacy and a 
halt to surveillance 
in this case im angry said the teenager a senior at the 
don bosco preparatory school in ramsey in the northeast corner of 
new jersey ive done nothing 
he said it was important to carry his lawsuit forward because 
its going to happen again and again 
ms cassell however told the judge todd patterson is so 
unbelievably unimportant to the fbi hes a kid 
as soon as the fbi discovered this they closed the case she 
said the fbi also conducted the least intrusive investigative 
possible she said 
ms cassell said the lawsuit should be dismissed because parts of 
the boys file were exempt from disclosure for national security 
reasons revealing the blacked out portions would disclose the 
investigative methods and sources used by the bureau according to 
fbi affidavits 
she also argued that pattersons privacy was not violated because 
only he was given information 
wolin heard arguments thursday but did not rule on the request to 
throw out the lawsuit 
he asked ms cassell to submit an affidavit from the fbi showing 
how the agencys records on patterson were pertinent to an 
authorized law enforcement activity 
aclu attorney frank askin said he would also ask that the case be 
given classaction status on first amendment grounds for other 
citizens who are the subject of fbi files 
a decision on classaction status was delayed until wolin ruled 
on the case an opinion was likely next week the judges staff said 
patterson contends that at least 50 pieces of mail used for his 
project came back damaged that was evidence of surveillance 
violating the youths first amendment right to seek information 
and correspond freely askin argued 
but ms cassell said no evidence existed that the tampering was 
at the fbis hands 
patterson who hopes to enter foreign diplomatic service said 
his main concern was over his future 
he said a security clearance is needed for an internship with the 
canadian government offered by the college of his choice the state 
university of new york at plattsburgh the fbi file might interfere 
with obtaining clearance and the internship he said

a researcher who conducted a survey showing one 
out of 15 teenage boys may be using steroids warns that such use of 
the musclebuilding drugs may continue unless society ends an 
obsession with success in athletics 
you have to change the values said we buckley assistant 
professor of health education at pennsylvania state university 
were the ones putting all the emphasis on sports were the ones 
putting all the emphasis on appearance 
were talking about potentially abusive behavior that has to be 
addressed directly or we may have individuals who grow up and 
suffer adverse health consequences 
in a survey of 3403 senior boys at 46 public and private high 
schools last year 226 boys or 66 percent of those responding 
said they had used steroids buckley and his associates reported in 
todays journal of the american medical association 
although the research wasnt based on a random sample of the 
nations high schools the study suggested that 250000 to 500000 
adolescents are using or have used steroids 
i didnt have any idea it would be this high buckley said 
calling his study the first of its scope in the nation 
androgenic anabolic steroids are synthetic derivatives of male 
hormones that some athletes take to help build up their muscles 
doctors have reported in recent years that steroids have been 
linked to serious side effects such as mood swings severe acne 
baldness temporary sterility abnormal liver function high blood 
pressure cardiovascular disease and possibly cancer of the liver 
and testicles 
while nearly half the boys in the study using steroids said they 
did so to improve athletic performance 267 percent said they used 
them for the muscular appearance the drugs can help produce 
its the newage body beautiful fitness people out there as 
well who are using anabolic steroids buckley said thursday 
about 10 percent said they used steroids to treat sportsrelated 
injuries and 71 percent cited social reasons such as peer pressure 
the study also showed that about one in five seniors claiming to 
take steroids said they got the drugs from a doctor pharmacist or 
veterinarian and 383 percent said they first took the drugs at age 
15 or younger 
the study called for education about steroids as early as junior 
high school noting that 35 percent of those who said they used 
steroids did not participate in school sports 
societal attitudes must be changed to get young people to avoid 
the quickfix they think steroids can provide buckley said 
he cited the example of canadian sprinter ben johnson who won a 
gold medal in the 100meter dash at the summer olympics in korea but 
was forced to forfeit the award when it was determined he had used 
the anabolic steroid stanazolol 
parents looking for steroid use should watch for unusually fast 
muscle growth mood swings or flareups of acne in their children 
buckley said 
virtually all studies on the longterm effects of steroids have 
involved people using them legally for other ailments so further 
study of the drugs effects particularly on adolescents is needed 
buckley added 
in an accompanying journal editorial dr wayne v moore of the 
university of kansas medical center in kansas city urged doctors to 
avoid prescribing steroids to adolescents except in rare cases of 
medical needs 
directing children into sports more suitable for their projected 
adult sizes also might remove the temptation to enhance strength 
andor size in an adolescent who does not possess the genetic 
capacity to be the biggest strongest and fastest he wrote

a sharp earthquake that may have been 
an aftershock to a quake two years ago jolted southern california 
shattering windows and knocking pictures askew but causing no 
serious damage or injury 
the quake centered about 13 miles northwest of here struck at 
953 pm thursday and was felt in at least five southern california 
counties from palm springs to los angeles 110 miles to the west and 
san diego 135 miles to the southeast authorities said 
it was sort of like riding a hobby horse said georgia 
duncan a san bernardino county sheriffs dispatcher in victorville 
60 miles northwest of palm springs the windows rattled and stuff 
on the cabinet sort of bounced around 
the temblor measured 48 on the richter scale of ground motion 
said hall daily spokesman for pasadenas california institute of 
technology which studies earthquake activity 
i think it was the strongest one we had since the big one in 
86 said palm springs police sgt ron starrs referring to a 
56magnitude quake that rocked palm springs on july 8 1986 
causing 53 million in property damage 
the latest quake which jolted a state still suffering from the 
effects of high winds fires and snowstorms in the last week might 
have been an aftershock of the 1986 temblor daily said 
the seismologists are looking into that possibility he said 
the quake knocked over liquor bottles and glasses at pompeii 
nightclub here where a few patrons headed for the door said 
manager johnny boreta 
it was a little shaker said diana perri manager of bonos 
a restaurant owned by palm springs celebrity mayor sonny bono 
mr and mrs bono did give us a call to make sure we were all ok 
about 15 moviegoers fled a theater at the palm desert town 
center but most of the 200 people in the audience chose to sit it 
out 
plate glass windows bowed at the palm springs police station and 
rims around ceiling sprinkler heads fell to the floor but few other 
problems were reported starrs said 
local hospitals reported no quakerelated injuries 
the most we had were some broken store windows downtown said 
police lt mike mccabe in palm springs 
in nearby palm desert mary jo lyon said the mirror on her 
bedroom wall shook and she ran from the room to check on her 
christmas tree which listed to one side after the jolt 
it shook me up she said 
donna smiler an employee of a 7eleven store in palm springs 
said the temblor was brief 
i just sat here and watched everything move all of our signs 
shook you could hear it it was a definite rumble she said 
in los angeles chris harris of hollywood said his typewriter 
fell off his desk and pictures were knocked askew 
the earthquake was the second substantial tremor this month in 
southern california 
on dec 3 a 50magnitude quake struck beneath downtown 
pasadena that quake was felt in seven counties but damage was 
mostly limited to the contents of store shelves and windows 
the most recent quake to cause extensive damage in metropolitan 
los angeles was a 59magnitude temblor that caused damage estimated 
at 358 million eight deaths and more than 200 injuries were 
attributed to that quake and its 53magnitude aftershock on oct 4 
1987 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight damage 
in the local area 4 moderate damage 5 considerable damage and 6 
severe damage

hundreds of japanese travelers took advantage of a 
new novisa rule on flights to the united states and an airline 
spokesman said today that the first day went with hardly a hitch 
starting thursday japan and the united states began a 21month 
pilot program that permits tourists and business visitors to enter 
without visas as long as they have a return or onward ticket and 
dont plan to stay for more than 90 days 
the new system warmly welcomed by the travel industry is 
expected to boost travel to the united states by freespending 
japanese as well as remove the visa routine for many japanese 
the only hitch reported was a japanese couple on a japan air 
lines flight from osaka to honolulu who didnt have return tickets 
said jal spokesman geoffrey tudor 
their return tickets had been bought for them in hawaii and 
were waiting in their hotel but the immigration authorities 
wouldnt let them enter until they bought new return tickets 
tudor said 
apart from that weve heard of no other untoward incidents 
he said 
tudor said the only figures he had heard was that 35 of 271 
people aboard one jal flight to san francisco had taken advantage of 
the visawaiver system 
at united airlines spokesman bob leu said about onethird of all 
japanese passengers thursday to the united states had gone without 
visas that meant hundreds had tried the novisa system but leu 
would not give exact numbers for reasons of commercial secrecy 
its a pretty high number i think for the first day leu 
said it went as smoothly as can be expected on the first day 
the united spokesman said it also had gone quite easy for 
us citizens arriving in japan without visas 
japanese immigration authorities said it would take several 
months before they had statistical information on the number of 
americans who came without visas but there were no reports of 
problems on the first day 
tudor said he was worried that there could be longer delays at 
us entry points as immigration officials spend more time 
questioning and processing japanese who dont have visas in their 
passports 
having flown 10 hours across the pacific to visit the united 
states or sunny hawaii how galling it is to spend three hours in an 
immigration queue tudor said thats not much of a welcome for 
some people 
the united states is notorious for being more difficult for 
foreign visitors to enter than most advanced countries as 
immigration officials try to make sure that a tourist doesnt intend 
to become an illegal immigrant also americans dont need visas to 
visit most european countries but europeans have to get visas at 
us embassies spending time or money in the process 
in 1986 the us congress passed a law permitting negotiations 
with other countries to waive visas in some cases britain and the 
united states started a reciprocal visawaiver program in july and 
japan is the second country 
last year 22 million japanese visited the united states more 
than any other country and spent an average 1000 dollars each in 
addition to the air ticket this year the number of japanese 
visitors is projected to rise to 26 million 
about 430000 americans visited japan in 1987 
the visawaiver system applies only to tourists and businessmen 
who intend short stays visas are still required for such visitors 
for stays of 90 days or more and for students exchange visitors 
journalists researchers and those who intend to marry and move to 
the united states

the us administration decided to talk with the 
palestine liberation organization after chairman yasser arafat 
threatened to resign according to a published report today 
the alqabas daily newspaper quoting an unnamed senior arab 
official said arafat was going to announce his resignation at a 
news conference wednesday in geneva only hours before president 
reagan said us officials would open a dialogue with the 
longshunned plo 
there was no immediate independent confirmation of the report 
alqabas said swedish foreign minister sten andersson who acted 
as a mediator between the plo and washington asked arafat to 
postpone the decision or at least refrain from announcing it until 
andersson had contacted washington 
the daily said arafat postponed his news conference for several 
hours until wednesday evening while andersson contacted us 
secretary of state george shultz about arafats plan to resign 
the paper quoted arafat as saying if the moderate palestinian 
leadership does not suit the americans then let them reach 
understanding with another leadership 
the inference appeared to be that if arafat quit more militant 
and less flexible figures could take over 
the paper said that following a telephone call by andersson the 
reagan administration advised him they would announce their decision 
to open a dialogue with the plo 
the americans cited arafats explicit recognition of israels 
right to exist and renunciation of terrorism as the reason they 
decided to talk with the plo

us aid to victims of the earthquake that 
devastated areas of armenia has deeply touched the soviet 
government the soviet ambassador to the united states says 
never before in the history of the soviet union have we had 
international cooperation yuri dubinin the soviet ambassador to 
the united states said thursday at a luncheon with religious and 
business leaders assisting in relief efforts 
we are deeply moved by this absolutely new element of our 
relationship 
relief organizers meanwhile announced that aid will continue to 
flow to armenia including about 800000 worth of machinery from 
fiat and drugs from american companies despite indications from the 
soviet government that it was discontinuing rescue efforts 
the us government has not officially helped the soviet union 
since the lendlease program that ended after world war ii efforts 
to assist in the chernobyl nuclear disaster were private 
at thursdays meeting john m evans deputy director of the 
office of soviet union affairs at the state department said that 
when news of the scope of the disaster reached president reagan 
there was never a single question about whether or not the 
government would try to help to the best of its ability 
the dec 7 earthquake centered in soviet armenia devastated the 
cities of spitak leninakan and kirovakan and killed about 55000 
people in rural areas the earthquake leveled 25 villages and 
damaged 100 more 
according to evans about 700000 people are homeless a figure 
dubinin confirmed officials in moscow however have estimated the 
number of homeless at 500000 evans said 130000 people were 
injured 
evans said the us government had provided more than 155 
million in aid and private american groups had provided more than 3 
million the international community had provided nearly 375 
million in aid he said 
rabbi arthur schneier president of the appeal of conscience 
foundation which organized the working luncheon told the 
associated press that italian automaker fiat was donating 1 billion 
lira or slightly less than 800000 in heavy duty trucks 
tractors excavation machines and earth removal equipment to the 
relief efforts 
on monday major us drug companies will meet to determine which 
company can send which supplies to the soviet union he said 
the us government will not be involved in the reconstruction of 
the area which the soviets estimate will cost 317 billion evans 
said 
dubinin asked about criticism that the relief efforts have been 
uncoordinated and ineffectual said we have difficulties and we 
have critics we are trying to take into account every critic from 
the armenian population from abroad 
another problem dubinin acknowledged is that the people do 
not want to leave this devastated region 
it is something human it is something understandable because 
they have their land there they have their buildings there they 
would like to be present they would like to see whether there is a 
chance to see somebody loved ones rescued it is natural but it 
is very difficult dubinin said

while syphilis is occuring less frequently among 
homosexuals cases of the disease have sharply increased among 
prostitutes and drug abusers who may be trading sex for drugs 
federal health officials say 
studies in philadelphia and connecticut have noted significant 
rises in the last three years in the numbers of syphilis patients 
from the latter two groups the national centers for disease control 
said thursday 
the magnitude of the increase suggests that the trends 
observed in connecticut and philadelphia reflect real changes the 
cdc said the emergence of syphilis among prostitutes drug users 
and their sexual contacts may be a widespread national phenomenon 
obviously biologically theres no interaction that we know of 
between drug use and syphilis said dr jonathan zenilman a cdc 
specialist in sexually transmitted diseases certainly what this 
looks like is that it may be a sexfordrugs type of phenomenon 
for example the cdc reported that in connecticut the percentage 
of female syphilis patients reporting that they were prostitutes 
rose from 7 percent in 1985 to 21 percent in 1987 the percentage of 
females with syphilis reporting drug use rose from zero to 14 
percent 
among heterosexual males in philadelphia the percentage of 
syphilis patients reporting contact with prostitutes rose from 2 
percent to 21 percent while the percentage reporting drug use rose 
from 5 to 13 
as syphilis skyrockets among prostitutes and drug users its 
dropping among homosexuals the cdc noted in the 198587 studies 
the percentage of male syphilis patients reporting that they were 
homosexual or bisexual dropped sharply from 38 percent to 11 
percent in connecticut from 53 percent to 18 percent in 
philadelphia 
in the wake of aids which strikes most often among homosexual 
men and drug abusers the gay community has had substantial 
safesex education efforts zenilman said the gay community 
itself is one that may be more responsive to behavior modification 
the drug abusing community has always been more difficult to 
reach somebody looking for a fix is not always interested in the 
long term 
through last week 37985 civilian syphilis cases had been 
reported in the united states this year up 14 percent from the same 
time a year ago and up 45 percent compared to the median for the 
past five years 
thats almost exclusively among heterosexual men zenilman 
said noting that the national total is increasing while the 
proportion in homosexual men in decreasing 
the cdcs report prepared by dr robert rolfs of the 
atlantabased agency said that limiting the spread of syphilis may 
require new tactics to better identify and treat syphilisinfected 
prostitutes drug users and their sexual contacts

military vans equipped with loudspeakers 
rumbled through the muddy streets of spitak and urged griefstricken 
residents to leave so crews could begin demolishing the remnants of 
the armenian city 
in nearby leninakan american rescue worker caroline hebard told 
abctvs nightline today that survivors of the dec 7 quake were 
camping out at night around fires near what had been their homes 
then searching by day for relatives in the rubble 
mike tamillow another american rescue worker in leninakan spoke 
of the vastness of destruction telling nightline that 
rescuers found a 60yearold woman who had been pinned in wreckage 
for five days next to her two dead children 
the leg of one of the children was blocking her air pathway and 
rescue workers had to amputate the leg to extricate the woman 
tamillow said 
relief workers in spitak said thursday they had given up hope of 
finding more survivors in the rubble of what used to be the 
thirdlargest city in armenia an estimated 15000 of the citys 
25000 residents died in the quake which measured 69 on the 
richter scale 
the quake killed at least 55000 people in the region and left 
500000 homeless 
julia taft an american relief official said today the rescue 
effort was nearly over voices and other signs of life had dropped 
sharply since monday when temperatures fell below freezing she 
said 
the official tass news agency said thursday only one person had 
been found alive in armenia the past 24 hours 
along with rescue operations stern measures on providing 
sanitary order in populated areas of regions of the disaster are of 
primary importance now the newspaper socialist industry said 
today 
the newspaper said of spitak there is a very acute problem of 
water supplies in the town there is a shortage of portable toilets 
and the removal of debris 
nouradian norig kritkorianizh first secretary of spitaks 
communist party said crews would begin razing the city sunday after 
an evacuation expected to take three days rebuilding of the city 
will begin in early spring he said without elaborating 
trucks distributed milk bread sausages meat and oranges to 
survivors in the cold damp city 
some people set up what was left of their household belongings 
upholstered chairs mattresses and even an occassional brass bed 
around bonfires where it was warmer than inside donated tents 
people pressed against the gates of what was once spitaks 
central market where soldiers distributed coats 
yesterday wednesday health minister yevgenvy chazov said the 
search was to continue but that with the lapse of time hopes grow 
smaller and smaller they are still looking for people in the 
ruins foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said at a 
moscow news briefing 
ms taft director of the us foreign disaster assistance 
office told nightline its very important that we understand 
that we are through practically with the search and rescue stage 
ms taft speaking from frankfurt west germany urged people to 
send money to the red cross or the armenian relief agency but to 
hold off on traveling to armenia or sending more supplies because of 
the congestion there 
there is a shroud of death she said somberly there are 
three victims the people who lost their lives the people who 
lived but lost their families and their hope and the relief workers 
who feel they should do more 
teams from france and britain began heading home thursday 
willie mcmartin head of the 14member international rescue corps 
from britain said he doubted anybody was still alive if i 
thought there was someone still alive i would not be sitting here 
mcmartin told reporters at londons heathrow airport 
mcmartin said his group was physically exhausted and that the 
soviets were beginning to employ bulldozers making it difficult for 
them to use their high technology equipment to find victims 
george reid spokesman for the league of red cross and red 
crescent societies said 25000 bodies had been counted based on 
figures provided to the red cross by the soviet council of ministers 
thousands of corpses remained buried in rubble 
in yerevan armenias capital psychologists began treating the 
scores of children left orphans by the quake 
many survivors are having nightmares and the soviet childrens 
fund a charity sent 11 child psychologists to armenia to help 
who has trouble sleeping psychologist valeria mukhina asked 
a group of children whose parents are dead or missing 
nearly all at the session raised their hands and yelled i do

two pilots who made an emergency landing on 
a remote glacier in their restored world war iiera plane were 
stranded for a third night after snow again thwarted efforts to 
rescue them 
they seem to be in good spirits and holding up well coast 
guard cmdr bruce merchant said late thursday theyre inside the 
aircraft so theyre relatively warm and safe 
the coast guard which has been in radio contact with the men 
planned to try again to lift them off grand pacific glacier in 
british columbia with a helicopter today if the weather cleared 
officials said 
the men who were unhurt have survival gear and food in the 
grumman widgeon amphibious plane which was undamaged in the landing 
pilot michael mills 38 and passenger charles buddy 
ferguson 31 of gustavus have enough supplies for three or four 
days coast guard lt rick ehret said 
the coast guard h3 helicopter was able to land thursday at the 
foot of the glacier at tarr inlet but the weather never cleared 
the chopper reached an elevation of only 1500 feet above sea level 
and the stranded men are several miles inland at the 3400foot 
level merchant said the helicopter returned to sitka along the 
southeast coast of alaska 
the huge glacier is 45 miles north of the small southeast alaska 
port town of gustavus and stretches across the international 
border the pilots are on the canadian side said marvin jensen 
superintendent of glacier bay national park and preserve 
a land recovery seems out of the question ehret said 
theyre going to have to wait for us to fly in there 
jensen said it might be possible to get a boat near the foot of 
the glacier and hike in he said it would take at least two days to 
get the men out the pair are four to five miles from tarr inlet 
said coast guard lt andrew berghorn 
the men were flying from cordova to gustavus when they made their 
emergency landing for unknown reasons ehret said 
a pilot in gustavus who declined to give his name said the plane 
may have been running out of fuel or hit a snow squall in the 
mountain pass above the glacier the plane had been reassembled and 
restored in anchorage during the past four months and was certified 
for flight he said 
mills wife connie said the men had recently restored the plane

prime minister yitzhak shamir seeking to 
counter the new usplo dialogue plans to launch a new peace 
initiative once a coalition government has been formed a top aide 
said today 
mr shamir is considering new moves after he forms the 
government said shamir spokesman avi pazner he is seriously 
considering options on how to act in the diplomatic field 
pazner would not elaborate but he denied a report in the haaretz 
daily newspaper that shamir considered granting autonomy to the 17 
million palestinians in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
mr shamir believes that unilateral moves have no value 
pazner told the associated press he believes only an agreement 
resulting from negotiations is viable 
haaretz quoted officials close to shamir as saying the prime 
minister who heads the rightwing likud bloc wanted to form a 
coalition with the leftleaning labor party as quickly as possible 
and then launch a peace initiative focusing on autonomy 
the newspaper also said shamir was deeply hurt by president 
reagans decision wednesday to open talks with the palestine 
liberation organization which israel considers a terrorist 
organization 
in a meeting with us ambassador thomas pickering on thursday 
shamir said the us decision was a terrible mistake and he 
criticized washington for not informing israel about it sooner 
haaretz said 
this behavior is unacceptable between two allies haaretz 
quoted shamir as telling pickering 
washingtons announcement that it would meet with the plo came 
after plo chairman yasser arafat renounced terrorism and said he 
recognized israels right to exist 
pazner predicted the talks would fail 
we believe that the united states will discover very soon the 
true face of the plo and will realize that it can not be a partner 
for negotiations and peace he said 
israel wants to see the us initiative fail quickly or it will 
face mounting international pressure for a favorable response to the 
plo analysts said 
a delay in the response could endanger relations with washington 
israels main ally and the source of 3 billion in annual aid 
but ariel merari of the tel aviv universitys jaffee center for 
strategic studies predicted usplo contacts would last for 
months or even a year without any dramatic developments as they 
focus on questions of procedure 
an agreement on a unsponsored peace conference would be the 
likely outcome of successful usplo talks many israelis view it 
as a forum for demanding farreaching land concessions from the 
jewish state 
but the first item on the agenda of usplo contacts will be the 
question of terrorism secretary of state george p shultz told 
israeli reporters in washington 
the first point we will make in that dialogue is to emphasize 
our total rejection of terrorism anywhere outside israel inside 
israel shultz said in remarks broadcast on israel television 
merari an expert on terrorism said arafat may order his fatah 
faction to refrain from terror attacks abroad or attempts to 
infiltrate israel on hostagetaking missions but he said terror 
linked to the palestinian uprising in the occupied territories will 
continue 
in the west bank and gaza strip palestinians called the us 
move a victory of their yearlong revolt which has left at least 326 
palestinians and 13 israelis dead 
dozens of jewish settlers from the territories began a hunger 
strike and pitched tents in front of shamirs office 
the us policy of recognizing the plo is the seed of the next 
war said ron nachman a settler leader israel cannot reach 
agreement with the plo theres no common ground and the result will 
be an explosion 
foreign minister shimon peres a political rival of shamir said 
the jewish state had to come up with a new political initiative as 
an answer to this situation 
peres proposed elections in the occupied territories to choose 
palestinian leaders for peace negotiations saying israel will not 
negotiate with an armed delegation instead of an elected one 
within peres leftleaning labor party a group of 30 doves 
called on the leadership to change the party platform and allow 
contacts with the plo 
ezer weizman a labor cabinet minister without portfolio said 
arafats statements made the plo a satisfactory partner 
i think a new era has opened he said now our political 
platform must be reconsidered

doctors hope a major new study of aids cases 
among drugfree heterosexuals will help them prevent a huge new 
epidemic of the disease stemming from that usually lowrisk group 
one of the key problems in the aids epidemic is that people 
dont know theyre at risk said dr stanley h weiss a 
researchers at the university of medicine and dentistry of new 
jersey 
thats particularly a problem among heterosexuals some of whom 
have no idea their partners are placing them at risk said weiss 
who is heading the project 
the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases said 
the 228 million fiveyear study is being conducted on 2000 
heterosexuals in paterson newark and jersey city nj and 
brooklyn ny 
unfortunately we see women and children as the newest wave of 
victims said dr james oleske one of the nations leading aids 
researchers the spread to women and children is a trend that is 
probably going to continue into the next decade 
oleske also a umdnj researcher who will serve on the study team 
said scientists hope to learn enough to stem a mammoth new aids 
epidemic the first wave of aids cases primarily affected homosexual 
and bisexual men and intravenous drug users 
dr anthony s fauci the institutes director said the four 
northeast areas were selected for the study because of their high 
concentration of hivinfected drug users a potential source of hiv 
infection in heterosexuals 
hiv or human immunodeficiency virus causes aids 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome attacks the bodys immune 
system rendering the victim incapable of resisting other diseases 
and infections the virus most often is spread through close contact 
with blood blood products or semen from infected persons it can 
also pass from an infected mother to an infant during pregnancy or 
birth 
as of dec 12 aids had been diagnosed in 80538 americans of 
whom more than half or 45164 have died since june 1 1981 
according to federal statistics no one is known to have recovered 
from aids 
in new jersey 65 percent of aids cases involve heterosexuals 
but nationally about 70 percent involve homosexual and bisexual men 
weiss said 
about 8 percent of the heterosexual cases in new jersey have no 
apparent risk factor for the aids virus other than heterosexual 
activity while about 4 percent cases nationally can be traced to 
heterosexual contact he added 
heterosexual conduct accounts for 30 percent of all aids cases 
among women according to the national institute of allergy and 
infectious diseases 
similar studies of heterosexuals have been conducted elsewhere 
but their samples have been too small to draw conclusions weiss 
said 
the sexual transmission and progression of aids among 
heterosexuals is virtually unexplored territory weiss said in 
effect we will be helping to write the book on this subject 
john french an epidemiologist with the new jersey department of 
health said the state has been an early indicator of the spread of 
aids through urban areas with positive results for about 11 percent 
of the people tested at three centers in the state other urban 
areas in the country can expect similar results in the next decade 
he said

bess myersons lawyer saying prosecutors were 
driven by desperation in their attempts to convict the former miss 
america of conspiracy told jurors in his summation you will 
never see anything as low 
attorney frederick hafetz on thursday said the case against miss 
myerson who is accused of trying to influence a judge was based 
primarily on circumstantial evidence and lambasted the government 
for its use of an unreliable star witness 
he noted that assistant us attorney stuart abrams in his 
summation made much of the fact that during the spring and summer 
of 1983 miss myerson was calling the judge on her private line 
while using an assumed name 
you only do something like that when you know youre doing 
something wrong abrams told the jury earlier this week 
hafetz conceded that evidence about the mysterious phone calls 
sounds suspicious and sexy but he countered there is 
not one whit of evidence the government needs to sustain a criminal 
conspiracy 
meantime us district judge john f keenan who plans to give 
the 11weekold case to jurors on monday ordered an early start for 
todays session and said lawyers for both sides would have only 
until days end to finish arguing their case 
he said it would be unfair for government lawyers to have all 
weekend to work on a rebuttal 
miss myerson miss america 1945 and once new york citys cultural 
affairs commissioner is accused of trying to influence a judges 
rulings in the divorce of her lover carl andy capasso by 
giving a city job to the judges daughter sukhreet gabel 
miss myerson capasso and the former judge are all on trial 
according to prosecutors former state supreme court justice 
hortense gabel slashed capassos weekly support payments to his 
estranged wife after miss myerson gave the 19000ayear job to 
sukhreet gabel in august 1983 
hafetz likened the gossipy testimony of many prosecution 
witnesses to a soap opera saying it has been rich in gossip it 
has been rich in rumor it has been rich in innuendo but the only 
thing it hasnt been rich in is hard evidence 
but his harshest criticism was reserved for the use of ms gabel 
as a witness against her mother 
ms gabel 39 said she took shopping bags full of documents from 
her mothers home to prosecutors and twice taperecorded phone 
conversations with her mother for the government 
shame on them hafetz said of the prosecution its a low 
an alltime low you can sit in an american courtroom for the rest 
of your life and you will never see anything as low 
hafetz who got ms gabel to admit on crossexamination that 
electroshock treatments for clinical depression had left her memory 
like swiss cheese asked the jury are they so desperate do 
they want to win the case that badly that they will stoop into the 
gutter with such indecent behavior 
miss myerson 64 capasso 43 and mrs gabel 75 who made 
interim rulings in capassos bitter divorce are all charged with 
conspiracy fraud and briberelated charges 
miss myerson is also charged with obstruction of justice she 
faces a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison if convicted of all 
charges 
her two codefendants face up to 25 years in prison if convicted

human remains during a joint excavation of an american warplane

pilot of a reconnaissance aircraft shot down in march 1968 over 
sepone in laos southern savannakhet province said lt col thomas 
j boyd a spokesman for the us pacific command

a judge says he sentenced an 18yearold killer to 
30 years in prison instead of the maximum life term partly because 
the two men he shot to death were homosexuals 
these two guys that got killed wouldnt have been killed if 
they hadnt been cruising the streets picking up teenage boys 
district judge jack hampton told the dallas times herald in an 
interview published today 
i dont much care for queers cruising the streets picking up 
teenage boys hampton said thursday ive got a teenage boy 
richard lee bednarski a richland college student at the time of 
his conviction nov 19 was found guilty of murder in the may 15 
slayings of tommy lee trimble 34 and lloyd griffin 27 
hampton said he rejected a prosecution request to sentence 
bednarski to life imprisonment because in his opinion bednarskis 
victims were not entirely blameless 
the sentence would have been much stiffer hampton said had the 
victims been a couple of housewives out shopping not hurting 
anybody 
these homosexuals by running around on weekends picking up 
teenage boys theyre asking for trouble hampton said they 
really are 
the judges statements provoked outrage from dallas gay alliance 
president william waybourn and surprise from griffins father don 
the judge is saying that queers are not worthy of legal 
protections and you can go out and shoot them any time waybourn 
said thursday unfortunately dallas county will reward him with 
reelection 
god help any other victim that gets into his court that was 
also at the wrong place at the wrong time 
i thought hampton was a fairer man than that said don 
griffin a city councilman in the west texas town of sterling city 
i always thought that a human life was a human life no matter 
what 
robert flowers executive director of the state commission on 
judicial conduct said hamptons reasoning in deciding on 
bednarskis sentence probably fell within the bounds of reasonable 
judicial discretion 
i cant right off think of any part of the code that might 
violate flowers said it is his discretion 
testimony in bednarskis trial indicated that he and a group of 
north mesquite high school students drove to dallas oak lawn area 
to harass homosexuals the night of may 15 
testimony indicated that bednarski persuaded another youth to 
join him in a plan to rob trimble and griffin who had invited the 
boys into their car the four drove to reverchon park and walked to 
a hilltop clearing 
the other youth testified that bednarski immediately pulled a 
pistol and ordered the men to take off their clothes 
when they refused he said bednarski began shooting trimble 
died immediately of wounds in the face neck and back griffin who 
was also shot three times died five days later at parkland memorial 
hospital 
witnesses said bednarski bragged that he stuck the gun in 
trimbles mouth before shooting him 
defense lawyer kevin clancy asked a jury to decide bednarskis 
guilt but asked that hampton set the punishment because he believed 
the judge would be more sympathetic clancy asked for the minimum 
sentence of five years 
prosecutor david pickett argued that the killings warranted a 
life sentence 
in my opinion a human being is a human being and the execution 
slaying of a human being deserves the maximum punishment pickett 
told the jury 
the judge said thursday that in sentencing bednarski he took into 
account the defendants lack of a criminal record his attendance of 
college classes and his being raised in a good home by a father who 
is a police officer in nearby euless 
hampton expressed no reservations about expressing his views 
just spell my name right he said if it makes anybody mad 
theyll forget it by 1990 when he is up for reelection

despite a plea by soul singer james brown that 
hed do anything to avoid prison and continue performing a judge 
sentenced him to six years for failing to stop for police and trying 
to run over two officers in a twostate car chase 
circuit judge hubert long sentenced brown on thursday after an 
aiken county jury convicted the 55yearold godfather of soul of 
one count of failing to stop for police and two counts of aggravated 
assault in the sept 24 chase 
the jury acquitted brown of two counts of assault with intent to 
kill 
long sentenced brown to six years for failing to stop and gave 
him a choice on the assault convictions pay a 6000 fine and spend 
five years on probation or do six months in prison brown wont have 
to decide until after he serves the sixyear term said the 
prosecutor solicitor robert harte 
brown who could have drawn a 20year term will be eligible for 
parole after serving 1 years he could win earlier eligibility for 
good behavior or prison work harte said 
hes going to serve some time harte said i cant say how 
much but its going to be a substantial amount 
mr brown is resigned to the fate the jury has handed him 
theres no point in arguing any further defense lawyer bill weeks 
said 
browns attorneys however were expected to return to court 
today to file appeal motions 
the jury deliberated for more than three hours before convicting 
the grammy awardwinner who lives in beech island about five miles 
southeast of augusta ga 
afterward brown holding a small bible told long about his 
delinquency as a juvenile and the difficulties he faced early in 
life 
the only thing that held me together was when i looked at the 
us flag and that represented a chance he said 
i respect police without them we have nothing any law is 
better than no law america thats the only thing ive got to 
believe in the greatest flag in the world 
james brown the man wants to do right ive wanted to do right 
all my life brown said ill do anything i can not to go to 
prison so i can continue my work 
long said after sentencing that he was not being hard on brown 
because of his celebrity status 
for those who disregard the law punishment is a certainty 
the judge said for those who say give him another chance this 
is not the first time ive got to consider the whole history 
harte noted that brown was convicted last february of assault and 
battery involving an officer and that in july the singer was found 
guilty of illegally carrying a pistol and pleaded no contest to 
carrying the drug pcp 
long said he was impressed by what brown and the singers friends 
had said about the performers efforts to fight drug abuse and 
promote education 
he ordered brown to undergo examination and treatment for any 
drug or alcohol problem he might have 
the chase through augusta ga and north augusta began after 
brown wielding a shotgun interrupted an insurance seminar in a 
building where he has an office 
the pursuit involved 10 to 14 vehicles and hit speeds of 6085 
mph officer ronnie delaughter testified 
at one point brown sped away after stopping and several officers 
shot out the tires on his pickup truck delaughter said brown also 
tried to run over two north augusta officers 
brown who pleaded innocent to the charges said wednesday he 
didnt stop for police because he feared for his life 
i was scared to death he said i went to vietnam and i 
wasnt that frightened 
his many hits include please please please night 
train papas got a brand new bag i got you i feel 
good say it loud im black and im proud and get up i

the supreme court today directed the 
president to reconsider the mercy petition of a sikh sentenced to 
death for the 1984 assassination of prime minister indira gandhi 
a fivejudge panel headed by chief justice rs pathak ordered 
the execution of the sikh kehar singh be held in abeyance in the 
meantime 
lawyers said the stay also applies automatically to the execution 
of satwant singh the other sikh sentenced to death in the case 
a trial court convicted the two in 1986 and sentenced them to 
hang the convictions and the sentences were upheld by the delhi 
high court later that year and by the supreme court in august 
kehar singh convicted of conspiracy in the case appealed to 
president ramaswamy venkataraman for mercy the only recourse left 
to a prisoner condemned to death by the supreme court the president 
dismissed the appeal last month and said in a letter he could not 
consider the merits of a case already decided by the highest court 
in the land 
the rejection of the appeal was challenged by kehar singhs 
lawyers who claimed venkataraman had powers to reconsider the 
facts the challenge came 15 hours before the two sikhs were 
scheduled to be hanged at new delhis tihar jail on dec 2 the 
death sentences have been stayed since then 
the judges ruled the president has the power to go into the 
merits of the case despite the supreme courts rulings 
theyve done justice its a great judgment said rajender 
singh kehar singhs son who was in court for the verdict of the 
fivejudge panel 
rs sodhi the lawyer for satwant singh said the stay on the 
execution applied also to his client 
mrs gandhi was shot in the garden of her new delhi residence on 
oct 31 1984 by two of her sikh bodyguards one of them beant 
singh was killed in a shootout with other bodyguards minutes later 
the other assassin satwant singh was arrested and charged after 
he recovered from gunshot wounds received in the shootout 
kehar singh a maternal uncle of beant singh was arrested later 
and charged with conspiracy 
all sikhs take the name singh which means lion in the punjabi 
language by doctrine of their faith 
mrs gandhs assassination was in revenge for an army raid she 
had ordered four months earlier on the golden temple sikhisms 
holiest shrine 
the shrine in amritsar had been taken over by armed sikh 
militants agitating for an independent homeland in the northern 
state of punjab about 1200 people most of them sikhs died in the 
army raid 
sikhs form 2 percent of indias 880 million people but are a 
majority in punjab sikh militants have been fighting for a separate 
state since 1982 claiming discrimination by the hindu community 
which makes up 80 percent of the countrys population

the time has come for those strangely ironic 
symptoms that seem inappropriate to the season but the rev lee 
fullerton offers some reassurance those holiday blues are 
really quite common 
as noted in pastoral and psychiatric counselling the melancholy 
oddly descends most widely in the presumably happiest periods 
especially the weeks from thanksgiving to christmas 
its when youre supposed to feel good and be happy said 
fullerton an atlanta pastor who has worked extensively in the 
mental health field but a lot of people dont feel that way 
theres a simple system for helping ward off that despondency he 
said talking about it with relatives friends or fellow church 
members or getting them to open up about it 
you cant just pull people out of it he said but it can 
help to encourage them to talk about it to let them know that most 
people have such feelings once in a while 
a costless christmas present to others he suggested in a 
telephone interview might be pay a little more attention to 
people 
fullerton 39 pastor of atlantas steward avenue united 
methodist church and formerly a pastoral counselor at the georgia 
mental health institute has written some prechristmas advice on 
the subject for fellow clergy 
it was distributed by the urban mission arm of the denominations 
north georgia conference 
fullerton cited two main factors that bring on the slump in mood 
the holiday reality often doesnt match the popularized image and 
the pace of activities all around appear abnormally accelerated and 
burdensome 
everything seems speeded up the merchandising going into a 
frenzy people getting behind in their shopping and having to fight 
crowds and traffic to do anything he said it zaps their energy 
and their enjoyment too 
more basically for many the problem is shattered expectations 
he said 
theyve grown up thinking christmas should be a big family 
gathering with gifts and everybody around and food on the table 
but thats often not the way things are 
in many cases the contrast is acute for single people for 
oneparent families for the homeless and other poor that dont 
have enough money to get the one gift a child has wanted all year 
for these and others in similar circumstances the typically 
portrayed images of christmas simply dont live up to the reality 
and its as if something had died fullerton said 
it shows on them they feel guilty they blame themselves 
theyre a lot harder on themselves in judgment than god would ever 
be by such harsh judgments emotionally and physically were 
ruining our health 
in the pamphlet for clergy fullerton said the church has the 
unique opportunity to do two special things to proclaim the 
holiday season as a time for thanksgiving expectation and 
celebration and to minister to those who do not feel thankful 
expectant or celebrative 
he said seasonal depression also can bring related illnesses such 
as ulcers and headaches and also result in family disputes and 
violence when people feel helpless and hopeless the tendency to 
lash out is greater law enforcement and victims assistance 
officers receive more requests for services than at any other time 
of year 
although christmas blues are quite common he said many people 
suppress them because they feel guilty or ahsamed but a 
sensitive pastor can spot those seeming listless disinterested or 
restless and offer comfort 
he suggested pastors build sermons on cases of biblical 
characters who endured despair or inviting psychiatrists or 
hospital chaplains to address church groups on anxiety and 
depression 
help people to see the holiday blues as normal he advised 
encouraging them to share their troubles with others he said 
pastors are not immune to the problem in this busy season and tells 
them 
be aware of your own limitations 
fullerton said the holiday slump usually starts out as a kind of 
low grade depression and a little help can stop it from 
getting even deeper down the line 
a lot of deepseated problems start like this as a seasonal 
problem but those who stay in it get worse and worse and end up 
very depressed the results he added can be serious such as 
heavy drinking or suicidal impulses 
but why this inconsistent mixture of sadness creeping into a time 
of joy 
i see it as strangely consistent in the christian faith he 
said at christmas theres an element of being down in the pit 
and god comes to you there 
you couldnt accept it any other way and the situation seems 
you would never get out but god comes in

of the khmer rouge and that titular president khieu samphan has no 
military power 
khieu samphan said in paris this week that pol pot who led a 
reign of terror in cambodia between 1975 and the 1978 vietnamese 
invasion was no longer active in the leadership 
khieu samphan has become the most visible of the khmer rouge 
leaders internationally 
hun sen said he would negotiate a peace settlement with khieu 
samphan but still regarded him and other khmer rouge leaders blamed 
for massive atrocities as unacceptable for any future political role 
in cambodia 
hun sen said only 50000 vietnamese troops would be left in 
cambodia after next wednesday when six divisions would have 
returned to vietnam 
he said all military and civilian advisers had left 
this will not affect the balance of forces on the battlefield 
due to our cambodian troops who are in control of all areas from 
which the vietnamese have withdrawn he said 
vietnamese assistance is considered very important but 
final success depends on the cambodian people he said we still 
have another two years which we think is reasonable to build our 
own forces 
he said his government would wage a peoples war using local 
and regional militia to eliminate the guerrillas he admitted 
however that these units face a shortage of ammunition and must 
rely on a mix of traditional and modern weapons 
we dont have the budget for a million troops but all citizens 
must master forces to defend their villages and districts he said 
hun sen said he met thursday with rafeeuddin ahmed special envoy 
of un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar to discuss a 
political settlement of the conflict 
he said the two agreed that a dissolution of the prohanoi 
government in cambodia prior to a peace agreement would certainly 
bring chaos 
hun sen repeated his opposition to an international peacekeeping 
force in cambodia but said an international control commission would 
be needed to supervise any political settlement 
hun sen who is regarded as the phnom penh governments most 
capable political leader also carries the foreign ministry 
portfolio

pass the spicy food hold the aspirin 
researchers today reported that meals taken with aspirin are more 
likely to harm the stomach than hot stuff 
the doctors fed 12 healthy volunteers four meals a bland steak 
dinner steak with three aspirin tablets an enchilada dinner with 
an ounce of jalapeno pepper and half a pepperoni pizza 
once a week for four weeks the eight men and four women ages 24 
to 43 ate one of the meals for lunch and dinner 
the researchers found that stomach linings were much worse after 
the meal with aspirin than after the mexican food pizza or bland 
steak the researchers said in the journal of the american medical 
association 
the lining protects the stomach from digestive acids that can 
cause ulcers 
in a further experiment the researchers sprayed tabasco sauce 
directly on the stomach lining examination later revealed bleeding 
but the researchers said they didnt know which ingredient to blame 
the red pepper or the vinegar 
so they inserted jalapeno pepper directly into the stomach 
examination later revealed no apparent damage to the lining the 
researchers said 
the researchers concluded that ingesting spicy meals poses no 
threat to the stomach linings of people who have no history of 
stomach problems 
the research was led by dr david y graham of the veterans 
administration medical center and baylor college of medicine in 
houston

jurors resumed deliberations today in the 
tax and mail fraud conspiracy trial of lyndon h larouche jr with a 
federal judges warning that the perennial presidential candidates 
controversial political views should not sway their verdict 
the jury of eight women and four men debated the complex case for 
4 hours thursday and recessed until this morning chief us 
district judge albert v bryan jr said they should be prepared to 
work through saturday if necessary to decide all 49 counts involved 
larouche and six associates were charged with mail fraud and 
conspiracy for allegedly raising more than 30 million in loans from 
supporters without any intention of repaying them 
in addition larouche 66 was charged with conspiring to defraud 
the internal revenue service by having all his personal expenses 
paid by various corporations he controls and claiming he had no 
taxable income 
larouche has not filed federal income tax returns for any year 
since 1978 government prosecutors say 
if convicted of all 13 counts against him larouche faces a 
maximum penalty of 65 years in prison and 325 million in fines 
the six other defendants faced lesser penalties if convicted 
they are william wertz the chief of larouches fund raising edward 
spannaus legal coordinator for larouche and fundraisers paul 
greenberg joyce rubinstein dennis small and michael billington 
bryan reminded the jurors before they received the case that 
membership in a political organization even one with honest 
albeit controversial views is lawful under the constitution and 
is not evidence of any criminal activity 
the judge also said they should not attach any significance to 
the fact that larouche was never summoned to testify in his own 
defense during the 15day trial 
in his rebuttal to the closing defense arguments us attorney 
kent robinson told jurors the only issue they must decide is whether 
larouche and his fundraisers were lying when they assured 
prospective lenders they would get their money back 
defense lawyers insisted that the fundraisers made such 
assurances in good faith but robinson said everybody in the 
larouche organization knew they were part of a bankruptcy waiting 
to happen when they solicited the loans and probably wouldnt be 
able to repay them 
the result the chief prosecutor said was an enormous crime 
a 30 million crime in which larouche followers were being bled 
dry 
robinson denied defense lawyers suggestions that the 
governments charges were an attempt to quiet a political 
movement defense lawyers claimed the larouche organization was 
the victim of government harassment because of unorthodox positions 
and a conspiratorial view of world events

drivers of cement mixers floral vans and 
tow trucks are being recruited as drunk busters in an effort to cut 
down on drunken driving 
the program unveiled by jefferson county on wednesday calls on 21 
agencies and businesses with a fleet of nearly 3700 
radiodispatched vehicles to ask that employees who observe drunken 
drivers relay the information to police 
drunk buster on board stickers will be placed on the 
vehicles bumpers 
by pulling this community together were showing that 
jefferson countians are serious when we say we want it to stop 
said jefferson county judgeexecutive harvey sloane 
john woodford assistant executive director of louisvilles 
transit agency said the idea originated with a suggestion from a 
bus driver days after a may 14 bus crash in northern kentucky killed 
27 people the bus was struck headon by an alleged drunken driver 
lt col dave whalin assistant county police chief said it may 
be difficult to apprehend drunken drivers by the time the tip is 
relayed to a patrol car but hopefully well have a car in the 
vicinity that can respond immediately 
and the program should have a deterrent effect because drunken 
drivers will know its not just the police looking for them he 
said 
whalin added that motorists with car telephones can report 
drunken drivers 
jerry vincent of a teamsters local representing truck drivers 
and corrections officers said union workers would take part 
nobody wants them drunken drivers out there he said

record was arraigned today for the slaying of prime minister olof 
palme and ordered to remain in police custody for further 
investigation 
christer pettersson who was arrested wednesday pleaded 
innocent prosecutors argued that there were reasonable grounds to 
believe he killed palme nearly three years ago and that he should 
be held while they build a case for trial 
district court judge mikael af geijerstam found for the 
prosecution during the closed negotiations 
pettersson covered his face with his hands as he entered the room 
under guard from an emergency entrance he wore blue jacket and 
jeans and appeared nervous and confused as the hearing got under way 
and he was asked to respond to murder charges

world disarmament movement was gunned down as he walked down a 
stockholm street with his wife the night of feb 28 1986

the courtroom was closed for further deliberations 
under swedish law a suspect ordered to remain in custody can 
continue to be interrogated by police while they build their case

conviction for manslaughter he has been interrogated since he was 
detained wednesday

as the man who was seen loitering outside the grand theater in 
downtown stockholm where palme and his wife saw a movie just before 
the killing 
palmes killer followed the couple down the street from the 
theater and shot him 
police have offered no motive

and stopped a swedish companys illegal arms shipments to tehran

holding her injured left arm in a sling she told reporters she 
was in hong kong for medical treatment

on the holiest day in afrikaner 
history president pw botha called for racial harmony today on the 
150th anniversary of the great trek that took white settlers into 
the african wilderness 
we must strive for national unity and for unity in our 
different communities botha said in a speech to 15000 whites 
gathered at the voortrekker monument to the 19th century pioneers 
his call contrasted sharply with a rival celebration by 
extremeright afrikaner cultural and political groups who view 
bothas limited race reforms as capitulation to the 26 million black 
majority 
this is a demonstration a protest of the afrikaner against 
what is going on in south africa socalled reform said carel 
boshoff leader of the afrikaner volkswag cultural organization that 
sponsored nearby alternative celebrations they also attracted about 
15000 people 
we do not see reform only as political change but total 
cultural change boshoff said we dont think its possible for 
the white south african nation to survive in that situation 
afrikanerdoms most momentous event took place when 
dutchdescended afrikaners left the britishruled cape colony for 
the countrys uncharted interior 
stories of hardships on the great trek and battles with african 
warriors have taken on mythical proportions for the countrys 3 
million afrikaners who dominate government and make up 60 percent 
of the white population 
the pioneer party which included some blacks vowed dec 16 
1838 to make the date sacred if they defeated a hostile zulu tribe 
they did so in the battle of blood river 
white brown and black stood together in the laager circled 
wagons at blood river in spite of those who want to suppress this 
fact today in an attempt to justify their own standpoints said 
botha it was not only a trek of white afrikaners 
all races were invited to the government celebrations but only a 
handful of nonwhites participated 
extremeright groups barred blacks from their ceremonies 
eugene terreblanche charismatic leader of the neonazi afrikaner 
resistance movement described the battle of blood river as the day 
when the white nation of africa was born 
terreblanche called for afrikaner unity drawing cheers from his 
followers in khaki uniforms with swastikalike patches 
the 100th anniversary proved a catalyst that united afrikaners 
and propelled the national party to power 10 years later the 
nationalists have ruled uninterrupted since 1948 and codified the 
apartheid policies of racial segregation 
blacks do not celebrate the holiday 
but a coalition of antiapartheid groups said they would pay 
homage to the chiefs who fought the whites in the 18th and 19th 
centuries

there may be no such thing as a free lunch but six 
teachers are being offered a 1000 bonus just to go out to dinner 
next semester with the parents of all their firstgrade pupils 
a relaxed meal together will give teachers and parents a chance 
to discuss how parents can get involved in their childs education 
said businessman philip garvin who is offering the bonus plus the 
cost of the meals to valdez elementary school teachers 
when the student goes to this special dinner and sees parents 
and teacher together on this festive occasion it should make an 
impression that school is important garvin said 
garvin president and owner of norac television productions also 
gave 2000 checks to five high school teachers deemed outstanding 
he contends that businessmen should contribute to education and 
that outstanding teachers like valued employees in the corporate 
world should be recognized with cash bonuses 
the only catch said garvin is that the teachers must spend the 
bonus on themselves not on the classroom 
teacher eloise garcia said she is thrilled with the idea and will 
use the money to throw a big party and celebrate

a new un peacekeeping force will monitor 
the withdrawal of 50000 cuban troops from angola senior un 
officials said today 
angola and cuba have agreed in principle to have the un force 
verify the pullout said an official involved in planning the 
southwestern africa peace settlement 
another official said the force probably will be no larger than 
50 men and is largely symbolic us spy satellites are expected to 
provide the actual intelligence data that south africa insists on 
both officials spoke on condition of anonymity 
marrack goulding a un undersecretarygeneral has been meeting 
this week with cuban and angolan officials to work out the size and 
deployment of the force 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar is to meet cuban and 
angolan officials saturday and sunday to complete the discussions 
the two marxist countries tuesday signed an agreement in 
principle with south africa pledging to withdraw the troops over 30 
months with half to be gone by nov 1 
south africa promised to start implementing a 10yearold un 
independence plan for neighboring southwest africa the territory 
better known as namibia that it has ruled for 73 years 
the force monitoring the cuban withdrawal is in addition to plans 
for 7500 un peacekeepers and 2000 military police and civilian 
officials to monitor the south african troop withdrawal from namibia 
and oversee independence elections 
south africa apparently wanted a un force to verify the cuban 
withdrawal partly because the united nations is monitoring its 
pullout and it did not want to be seen as the only party requiring 
international supervision 
under the accord independence will begin april 1 when 3000 
cuban troops are to have been withdrawn from angola 
nov 1 is the date set for electing a namibian national assembly 
a final agreement between south africa cuba and angola is to be 
signed thursday in new york 
cuban troops went to angola in 1975 to help the government fight 
invading south african troops and usbacked rebels of the 
rightwing national union for the total independence of angola

president reagan said today the 
palestine liberation organization finally moderated its stand on 
israel because the united states was strong and steadfast in 
support of the jewish states sovereignty 
in a farewell foreign policy address to students and faculty at 
the university of virginia reagan said that resolve has now paid 
off 
as american officials prepared to begin a dialogue with yasser 
arafats plo long branded by us administrations as an 
international terrorist organization committed to the destruction of 
the jewish state the president used his speech at thomas 
jeffersons university to extoll the virtues of an america willing 
to use its power and influence to affect vital movements on the 
world stage 
today we live in a world in which america no longer enjoys 
preponderant power the president said but must lead by example 
and persuasion 
where we are strong and steadfast we succeed he said in 
the persian gulf the united states made clear its commitment to 
defend freedom of navigation and free world interests and this 
helped hasten an end to the gulf war 
and the country stood firm for years insisting that the plo 
had to accept israels right to exist and renounce terrorism 
he said 
later in a questionandanswer session with university students 
reagan said that opening a us dialogue with the plo has been a 
great step forward for peace 
but he also said that it is only going to come when the 
principals come together to negotiate 
he said the opening to the plo was possible because arafats 
organization renounced terrorism and declared its acceptance of 
israels right to exist without fuzzing it up with ambiguous 
dialogue 
reagan said thursday that he wouldnt hesitate to break off 
the talks with the plo representatives if arafats organization 
failed to live up to its promises 
the presidents speech today was likely his last focusing 
exclusively on foreign affairs although white house officials have 
said that reagan plans a farewell address to the nation probably 
from the oval office in january and he is expected to grant 
reporters a series of curtainclosing interviews 
in todays speech reagan also said that he was confident 
ussoviet relations were on a positive course and said that we 
must keep our heads in dealing with the kremlin 
serious problems fundamental differences remain with the 
soviet union he said our system is one of checks and balances 
theirs for all its reforms remains a oneparty authoritarian 
system that institutionalizes the concentration of power 
in oval office picturetaking sessions thursday reagan said he 
decided to reverse the 13yearold policy of not talking directly to 
the plo after arafat made clear wednesday that his organization was 
accepting israels right to exist and renounced terrorism as a way 
of achieving policy objectives 
reagan said then that israel which expressed regret at the 
policy shift should not be upset because the united states has 
not retreated one inch from our position of guaranteeing the 
safety of israel 
the president said the plos words must be matched by 
performance and if theyre not why were back where we started 
questioned about what he would do if the plo failed to live up to 
its commitments reagan said well wed certainly break off 
communications he stressed that the ultimate solution in the 
middle east does not depend on outsiders or us 
peace must be brought about by the involved nations meeting 
with each other and settling their differences he said 
asked why the united states does not recognize a palestinian 
state reagan said because there is no such thing as of now 
there isnt a palestinian state and if you recognize someone as 
that it would be us declaring who was in charge there 
the us reversal came a day after the administration said 
arafats speech on tuesday in geneva before the un general 
assembly had failed to meet its conditions arafat spoke again on 
wednesday in geneva at a news conference prompting the reagan 
decision to open talks 
it was less than three weeks ago that secretary of state george 
shultz denied the plo leader an entry visa to address the un 
general assembly in new york the secretary of state had accused the 
plo of terrorism and said arafat was an accessory to such 
terrorism 
for more than a decade the united states has insisted that the 
plo accept un resolutions adopted in 1967 and 1973 that affirm the 
right of all states in the middle east to live in peace israel is 
not specifically mentioned the united states also has demanded that 
arafats organization renounce terrorism and accept israels right 
to exist 
fitzwater said us officials would move cautiously into the 
dialogue with plo represesentatives and that the talks would 
establish a foundation for the organization to prove that they 
have changed their ways 
its too early to speculate on how these things might take 
place he said this is a first step and how the followon 
steps will evolve we really dont want to draw parameters at this 
point 
we did have strong feelings about the plo and we still have 
strong feelings fitzwater said but he said the administration 
decided to permit contacts because there has been evidence of 
change

in the clubby confines of the united states 
senate where even bitter enemies address each other with genteel 
formality john tower often stood alone 
the 63yearold texas republican picked by presidentelect bush 
for defense secretary possesses a sharp tongue and quick temper 
two traits that led him into numerous battles with other legislators 
during president reagans first term which saw the largest defense 
buildup in peacetime history 
a former college professor tower was narrowly elected to the 
senate in 1961 winning a special election to fill the seat vacated 
by lyndon b johnson when johnson became vice president 
tower was named to the armed services committee where he made a 
name for himself as an expert on the details of weapons systems and 
defense policy 
in 1980 reagan swept into office carrying enough republican 
candidates along with him to give the gop control of the senate 
tower was a candidate at that time to become secretary of defense 
but the job went to caspar weinberger and tower took over as 
chairman of the armed services comittee 
the short prickly tower was the chief legislative champion of 
reagans defense spending buildup defending the larger budgets 
against all critics a deeply conservative critic of the soviet 
union tower argued that us defenses had been eroded to a 
dangerously low level 
in one 1981 incident he got into a bitter shouting match over 
military spending priorities with gop sen ted stevens of alaska 
chairman of a rival subcommittee which also had jurisdiction over 
pentagon budgets 
tower strongly supported reagans buildup although he could be 
critical of the administration for example after loyally backing 
administration decisions on the mx missilebasing controversy tower 
became angry when officials couldnt agree on particulars he moved 
to block development until an acceptable plan was sent to capitol 
hill 
in 1984 facing another reelection campaign tower abruptly 
retired saying hed had enough of the senate 
he became a highpriced washington consultant and handled several 
jobs for reagan shortly after leaving office tower was named to 
the us team negotiating with the soviets in geneva for deep cuts 
in longrange atomic weapons 
tower quit after 14 months in that post and friends said he had 
been bored by the position in november 1986 reagan picked tower as 
chairman of the threeman presidential commission investigating the 
irancontra affair 
during all that time there was continuing speculation that tower 
would succeed weinberger at the pentagon but when weinberger 
finally left last year frank c carlucci was named to replace him 
tower worked hard for bush during the presidential campaign 
hoping finally to be named to the top pentagon job the one 
position he had coveted for years according to friends 
the son of a methodist minister tower was in the navy during 
world war ii after the war he worked as a radio announcer and 
insurance salesman before teaching political science at midwestern 
state university in wichita falls texas 
tower began his national political life in 1960 when he ran a 
losing senate race against lyndon johnson who was on the texas 
ballot both as senator and vicepresidential candidate when johnson 
quit democrat william a blakley was appointed to succeed him but 
tower beat blakley by 8000 votes in a 1961 special election tower 
won reelection three times each by a narrow margin 
tower has also been the subject of rumors about his personal 
life particuarly after his 1987 divorce from his second wife lilla 
the divorce was granted after a legal battle in which she alleged 
that tower had committed marital misconduct and carried on 
affairs during their 10year marriage towers deposition responding 
to the charges was sealed by agreement of both parties 
the federal bureau of investigation conducted an extensive 
background check into the rumors of towers extramarital affairs and 
drinking

the united states and greece today ended their 
12th round of talks on us military bases in the mediterranean 
nation without resolving important differences in the way of 
extending an agreement that expires tuesday state department 
officials said 
once the fiveyear leases for four bases and about 20 additional 
communications facilities expire the united states has 17 months to 
leave one official said the next round of talks on extending the 
agreement is scheduled for january said the officials all of whom 
requested anonymity 
important differences remain but the negotiations are not at an 
impasse said one 
one major obstacle is a greek demand that the united states close 
its most visible base the hellenikon air force base in suburban 
athens the base has been an irritant to nationalist and leftist 
groups opposed to the us presence in their country 
talks between the sides broke off in september after greece 
announced it would shut down hellenikon once the lease expires 
about 1400 american servicemen 200 civilian employees and 700 
greeks work at the base which was established in the 1940s 
negotiations resumed oct 3 after secretary of state george 
shultz met foreign minister carolos popoulias in washington 
since the 1950s the united states has operated four bases in 
greece in addition to hellenikon there is a navy communications 
base at nea makri near athens a navy installation at souda bay on 
the island of crete and an air force communications base at gournes 
also on crete 
the united states gives greece more than 430 million a year in 
military credits in exchange for the bases 
the government of socialist premier andreas papandreou has been 
under heavy pressure to remove the bases and the pressure is likely 
to increase during the campaign for june elections in greece

southern bell has scaled back service at four 
drugridden housing projects one of them so violent that mail is 
delivered under police escort 
weve had folks flash guns and pull knives on our installers 
and threaten to use explosives on our vans its a compromise 
between providing service and protecting employees said doug 
kendig a telephone company spokesman 
mail delivery to bankhead courts was suspended saturday when a 
letter carrier said he was caught near gunfire between suspected 
drug dealers service to the 450 apartments resumed wednesday under 
police escort 
city council president marvin s arrington said thursday that 
anarchy almost exists in the project he said residents have 
attacked police officers and have not used an anonymous police 
hotline to report drug activity 
i just dont think that people living in bankhead courts know 
exactly what theyre doing to that community they are going to 
become an enclave unto themselves he said 
i think its unfair to ask people to put their lives on the 
line in these communities we need to say to the residents you are 
harming yourselves 
kendig said southern bell has restricted installation and repair 
service except for emergencies to monday mornings in bankhead 
courts and the englewood gilbert gardens and jonesboro south 
apartments workers will enter in groups only 
southern bell made its decision two weeks ago after a female 
technician was harassed at gilbert gardens by six men who accused 
her of being a police officer he said one man drew a gun while the 
others rifled her van kendig said 
the woman was released when the resident whose phone she had 
repaired came outside and vouched for her kendig said 
police chief morris redding said southern bell was overreacting 
we dont have any projects that people cannot move in and out 
of he said 
bankhead courts is not that bad its just got a reputation 
right now said gwen scales daughter of the tenant association 
president at the complex

presidentelect bush said today that he and 
john tower his choice for defense secretary pointment surfaced but aides 
said he has been a strong 
supporter of sdi in negotiations with the soviets in geneva 
switzerland 
edward rowny a special adviser to president reagan on arms 
control said he has always known tower to support star wars 
but graham said tower sought to have a watereddown platform on 
star wars adopted at the republican national convention in new 
orleans the former general also said he fears star wars will fall 
victim to budgetcutting in the early 1990s as pentagon officials 
seek to pay for existing weapons systems while aiming to cut the 
deficit 
but wallop said early deployment of star wars is not a big 
expense 
on the other side of the fence some democrats have complained 
that tower may be too close to defense contractors to make the tough 
cuts needed to trim federal spending 
reagans military budget slated to go to congress jan 9 calls 
for increasing this years total of 2995 billion by 2 percent 
after allowing for inflation 
bush has indicated he will settle for zero growth after inflation 
meantime wallop said he doesnt think tower is so totally 
crippled by the prolonged appointment process that he wouldnt be 
an effective defense secretary 
but both democrats and republicans including sen john mccain 
rariz complained that bush should not have kept tower hanging 
former secretary of defense james schlesinger said the delay may 
have done damage to the office or to sen tower personally

american and soviet negotiators have concluded 
four months of talks on limiting underground nuclear tests without 
agreement reagan administration officials said today 
the round that ended thursday had begun in geneva on aug 29 the 
negotiators adjourned without setting a date for resumption 
but the negotiators made significant progress toward completion 
of effective verification protocols the white house said in a 
statement thursday 
disagreement centered on ways to verify compliance with 1974 and 
1976 ussoviet treaties limiting underground nuclear blasts the 
only kind still permissible to 150 kilotons 
the treaties have never been ratified by the senate president 
reagan promised to seek senate approval but only after verification 
measures were adopted 
the soviets have stopped pushing for a moratorium on further 
tests and the two sides conducted two joint experiments on 
verification measures said a us official speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
one test was held in nevada in july and the second in 
semipalatinsk in the soviet union in september

presidentelect bush today named former texas 
sen john tower to be the nations next defense secretary capping 
an extraordinary semipublic debate over the retired lawmakers 
personal and professional fitness for the post 
in making the announcement before reporters bush hailed my 
friend sen tower as a man of great experience expertise and 
commitment to peace and freedom he said the former lawmaker is 
committed to reforming the pentagon 
tower thanked bush for the appointment and said the nation must 
have as much if not more defense for less money he said that 
would require reforming the defense purchasing system as well as 
installing biennial budgeting he said both depended on close 
cooperation with congress 
bush dodged but did not deny a question of whether he intends to 
appoint outgoing gop rep jack kemp a rival in the 1988 
presidential campaign to head the department of housing and urban 
development sources say that decision has been made and that the 
incoming president also intends to make chicago transportation 
official samuel skinner his secretary of transportation 
bush met on thursday with dr louis sullivan a medical school 
president and top contender to become secretary of health and human 
services and the first black in the bush cabinet 
with bush rushing to complete his cabinet by the end of next 
week sources also said gary macdougal a chicago business executive 
and bush transition adviser has emerged as a leading contender to 
be secretary of labor 
tower has held a variety of sensitive posts since leaving 
congress including as a negotiator in arms control talks with the 
soviet union and as head of a review board popularly known as the 
tower commission appointed by president reagan to probe the 
irancontra affair 
bush made the announcement of towers appointment in the 
customary style at an appearance before reporters that quickly 
turned into a questionandanswer session 
asked about a possible meeting with soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev bush said there is no expectation that we will or 
wont have a summit session i dont want to send out a signal 
that signals recalcitrance or unwillingness to think anew or 
unwillingness to try to build upon progress he said but he said 
he didnt want to send out the other signal and seem to be 
acting hastily 
he said gorbachev and other soviet officials understand his 
viewpoint 
the presidentelect said he wouldnt overstate the importance 
of the united states beginning meetings with the palestine 
liberation organization he stressed that the reagan administration 
has embarked on a dialogue and not a negotiation 
as for tower some conservatives have complained that he is not a 
strong supporter of the proposed strategic defense initiative known 
as star wars however bush said senator tower and i agree with 
the position i took in the campaign which is strong support for 
sdi 
tower himself said the proposed system would not only be a useful 
deterrent to attack but also a very valuable negotiating tool 
asked if that meant he thought of it only as a bargaining chip 
he responded not a chip leverage negotiating leverage 
bush once had planned to name a defense secretary by 
thanksgiving but delayed the decision pending the completion of an 
extensive background check that check delved into the former texas 
lawmakers connections with the defense industry as well as with 
allegations of womanizing and drinking problems 
asked whether he was satisfied with the investigation into issues 
of a personal nature bush shot back issues or rumors when the 
reporter persisted the presidentelect said he was totally 
satisfied bush said the most inquisitive members of the 
senate would be satisfied by the investigation a reference to the 
confirmation vote that tower must win to take his cabinet post 
bush also said tower would emerge stronger for the lengthy 
preappointment buildup he refused to answer further questions on 
towers personal life 
towers appointment to head the pentagon was first rumored in the 
days immediately following bushs election more than a month ago 
but it quickly sparked a highly unusual debate 
one set of issues revolved around the former senators ability to 
control the pentagons bureaucracy and purchasing system 
particularly in light of his staunch support for president reagans 
massive arms buildup in the early 1980s and the consulting contracts 
he holds with five major defense firms tower retired from the 
senate in 1985 after 24 years including the final four as chairman 
of the armed services committee 
towers personal life also became grist for the transition mill 
tower was divorced from his second wife lilla in 1987 she alleged 
marital misconduct on his part during their 10 years together 
towers deposition responding to the charges was sealed by mutual 
agreement 
as the weeks dragged on close aides to tower telephoned 
reporters assuring them that he understood that impeccable personal 
conduct was required of the man who leads the defense department 
bush received a report on the fbi check into tower on thursday 
selection of kemp 53 for the cabinet would cheer conservatives 
who so far have seen few from their ranks win top jobs in the 
incoming administration 
an alsoran in the republican primaries last winter kemp was an 
original sponsor of the 1981 tax cut legislation championed by 
president reagan and is an ardent advocate of government 
deregulation 
transition sources said sullivan 55 president of morehouse 
school of medicine in atlanta had the inside track for the job of 
health and human services secretary 
sullivan a longtime friend of george and barbara bush met with 
the vice president on thursday to discuss the job transition aides 
said he assured bush he shared the vice presidents antiabortion 
views 
sullivan is not the only black reportedly under consideration for 
the bush cabinet which already includes a hispanic lauro f 
cavazos the holdover secretary of education 
retired army gen julius w becton jr who now runs the federal 
emergency management agency is reportedly in the running to head 
the new department of veterans affairs 
meanwhile transition officials said skinner 50 chairman of the 
regional transportation authority of northeastern illinois had been 
offered the job of transportation secretary and had accepted it and 
that all that remained was for the appointment to be formally 
announced 
for labor secretary macdougal 52 former chairman of mark 
controls corp was reportedly among four candidates on a short list 
for the job along with washington labor lawyer william kilberg 
patricia diaz dennis a member of the federal communications 
commission and frank doyle a senior vice president for general 
electric co constance horner the head of the office of personnel 
management has faded as a top contender administration sources

that would fulfill at least some aspirations of 17 million 
palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip where a rebellion 
against israeli rule began a year ago 
they have focused on approaches that would exclude the plo which 
prominent palestinians say will not work 
foreign minister shimon peres leader of the centerleft labor 
party proposed elections in which palestinians of the occupied 
lands would choose local leaders with whom israel could negotiate 
we are facing a new situation he told reporters i hope 
israel will say to the palestinians stop shooting and go voting 
give up your bullets and go to your ballots 
prime minister yitzhak shamir who leads the conservative likud 
bloc and has vowed never to deal with the plo is described by aides 
as recognizing the need for a credible israeli plan 
avi pazner shamirs spokesman said in an interview the prime 
minister is considering new moves to be announced when a new 
government is formed 
be sure that mr shamir is preparing a peace move which will 
surprise everyone he added on israel radio but refused to 
disclose details 
ehud olmert a leading likud figure recommended that israel 
establish selfrule for palestinians as envisioned in the 
usmediated 1978 camp david accords between egypt and israel 
those accords led to the peace treaty of march 1979 
this would be an israeli initiative to bring about autonomy in 
direct talks with the local population which is the true partner we 
need to talk with olmert said 
the plo rejects limited selfrule and is committed to creating an 
independent palestine which israel says would threaten its 
existence the palestine national council which acts as the plo 
legislature proclaimed an independent state nov 15 in algiers 
saeb erakat a political science professor at an najah university 
in the west bank said palestinians would reject both autonomy and 
elections 
palestinians will not buy products they dont like even if 
there are new labels on them he said 
erakat added however we always used to say there could be no 
comprehensive peace without the plo but whether we like it or not 
it is also true that peace cant be realized without israel 
shlomo avineri former directorgeneral of israels foreign 
ministry said now you see the beginnings of a reassessment that 
is reflecting the changes in the plo now some in israel are 
demanding a rethinking of policy regarding negotiations with the 
plo 
he proposed some dramatic test of plo chairman yasser arafat 
such as urging him to follow the path of anwar sadat the late 
president of egypt who came to jerusalem in november 1977 to make 
peace avineri is on the political science staff of hebrew 
university 
one sign of a shift in israeli thinking was a call for 
recognition of the plo by prominent labor party doves among them 
former defense minister ezer weizman and uzi baram the party 
secretarygeneral 
we have to establish new policies that will not make us a new 
rejection front baram said 
weizman a former fighter pilot said on israel radio a people 
with such an air force and army and readiness to take a risk in 
battle can also take a risk for a peace process 
nimrod novick political adviser to peres said israel must 
develop a peace plan capable of reducing international pressure 
if we put an initiative on the table we force all other 
parties to deal with it he said on the radio if we sit 
quietly we will be forced to deal with the initiative of someone 
else

a black man arrested in a shootout that wounded 
six white police officers was sentenced to five to 15 years in 
prison on weapons charges while 1500 officers outside the 
courthouse demanded the maximum penalty 
i am not some racist brutal beast or killer that the drug 
trafficking police are trying to paint me as larry davis 22 
told acting supreme court justice bernard fried on thursday i 
challenge you to give me the same sentence as you would give your 
own son 
the judge called davis a violent guncarrying drug dealer in 
sentencing him on weapons possession charges davis could have 
received 10 to 20 years 
a jury in the bronx found davis innocent nov 20 of attempted 
murder and aggravated assault in the 1986 shootout six police 
officers were wounded davis escaped unscathed through a window 
setting off a 17day nationwide manhunt 
police had come to arrest him in the slayings of four suspected 
drug dealers davis was acquitted of murder in that case on march 3 
prior to the sentencing about 1500 police officers incensed by 
the verdict gathered outside the bronx courthouse to demand the 
maximum prison term 
davis at sentencing called fried his persecutor and accused 
him of having attempted to pretry my case at one point rolling 
up his shirt sleeve and pants leg to show off injuries allegedly 
inflicted by correction officers 
the lead prosecutor in the case brian wilson said he was 
disappointed by the sentence 
davis attorney william kunstler called it a racist 
sentence davis must serve at least five years before being 
eligible for parole 
kunstler had argued that police without a warrant came to the 
apartment intent on killing davis and that he fired in selfdefense 
when the officers began shooting without provocation prosecutors 
contended davis fired first

the supreme court on friday blocked the 
execution of a sikh convicted of assassinating prime minister indira 
gandhi and ordered the president to reconsider the mans request for 
clemency 
the order effectively prevented the execution of a second man 
convicted in the 1984 assassination a defense attorney said 
a five judgepanel said the constitution allows president 
ramaswamy venkataraman to examine the case and decide whether a 
pardon is warranted 
kehar singh who was convicted of conspiracy in the 
assassination appealed to venkataraman for mercy but the president 
dismissed the appeal last month saying he could not consider the 
merits of a case decided by the supreme court 
the presidents denial was appealed to the court the nations 
highest 
in its ruling the court compared the us and indian judicial 
systems 
in the united states a pardon by the president has been 
regarded not as a private act of grace but as a part of 
constitutional scheme we have no doubt in our mind that it should 
be so treated also in the indian republic 
the petition invoking that power shall be deemed to be pending 
before the president to be dealt with and disposed of afresh the 
court said 
the appeal was filed 15 hours before kehar singh and another 
sikh satwant singh were scheduled to be hanged at new delhis 
maximumsecurity tihar jail on dec 2 the death sentences have been 
stayed since then 
the men were convicted and sentenced in 1986 and their appeals 
were rejected in 1986 by the delhi high court and in august by the 
supreme court 
theyve done justice its a great judgment said rajender 
singh kehar singhs son who was present in court to hear the 
verdict friday 
rs sodhi the lawyer for satwant singh said the stay of 
execution also applied to his client but government officials could 
not be reached immediately to confirm this 
mrs gandhi was shot in the garden of her new delhi residence on 
oct 31 1984 by two of her sikh bodyguards one of them beant 
singh was killed in a shootout with other bodyguards minutes later 
the other satwant singh was arrested after he recovered from 
wounds received in the shootout kehar singh a maternal uncle of 
beant singh was arrested later and charged with conspiracy 
all sikhs take the name singh which means lion in the punjabi 
language by doctrine of their faith 
mrs gandhs assassination was in retaliation for an army raid 
she had ordered four months earlier on the golden temple sikhisms 
holiest shrine 
the shrine in amritsar had been taken over by armed sikh 
militants demanding an independent homeland in the northern state of 
punjab about 1200 people most of them sikhs died in the army 
raid 
sikhs comprise only 2 percent of indias 880 million people but 
are in a majority in punjab sikh militants have been fighting for a 
separate state since 1982 claiming discrimination by the hindu 
community which makes up 80 percent of the countrys population

costcontrol incentives provided by health 
maintenance organizations serving medicare patients could threaten 
the quality of medical care by leading doctors to cut corners a 
congressional report says 
the general accounting office a congressional investigative 
agency says strong hmo management controls are needed to prevent 
abuses 
the report was issued this week at the request of rep fortney h 
pete stark dcalif who has been attempting to reach a 
compromise with health maintenance organizations on regulatory 
legislation 
starksponsored legislation that was approved in 1986 would 
outlaw in 1990 incentives paid by health maintenance organizations 
to their participating physicians to control the cost of services to 
medicare patients 
that measure however was so sweeping that it would ban 
profitsharing payments and certain other benefits paid by even the 
bestrun hmos to participating physicians congress thus can be 
expected to take another look at the issue in the year ahead 
incentive payments have raised questions because medicare pays 
hmos a fixed monthly amount for each beneficiary enrolled to provide 
all health services covered by the program the system gives the 
hmos an incentive to control services and make certain that 
unnecessary ones are not provided the hmos often pass along 
incentives to participating physicians 
many are concerned that the incentives given to the 
participating physicians may be so strong that they represent a 
potential threat to the quality of care by encouraging inappropriate 
reductions in service the report said 
stark chairman of the house ways and means committees health 
subcommittee said in a statement that the report confirms my 
fears that some hmos may give so many incentives to doctors not 
to order tests or refer patients to specialists that the quality of 
care could suffer 
he cited a suggestion in the gaos report that congress may 
wish to retain a ban on financial incentive arrangements that 
closely link financial rewards with individual treatment decisions 
andor risk for services by physicians 
the report outlined four ways in which hmos provide costcontrol 
incentives to physicians 
some pay the doctors a fixed amount of money for each medicare 
patient under such arrangements physicians can be forced to fund 
care out of their own pockets the report said 
other hmos distribute incentives among participating physicians 
based on the cost performance of individual doctors this could 
dramatically affect the size of such payments the report said 
hmos have at times paid participating physicians a percentage of 
overall cost savings the report said that could mean the greater 
the potential for in appropriate reductions in services 
finally some physicians are measured for costcontrol 
performance over a short period of time the report said it would be 
better to take a longterm view of such matters

the government was ordered friday to pay 319 
residents of a southern japanese city 159 million in damages to 
compensate them for suffering caused by noise at their local airport 
those compensated were among 507 residents of fukuoka who filed 
civil suits in 1976 and 1981 against the government they asked for 
a ban on night flights at the airport to end the noise pollution 
the plaintiffs complained of stomach ulcers sleeplessness and 
hearing difficulties caused by nighttime military and civilian 
flights according to a court spokesman yuichi shiona 
the court ruled friday it could not ban nighttime flights at the 
airport partly because of national security concerns outside its 
jurisdiction but it ordered the government to pay 159 million in 
damages to 319 of the plaintiffs for suffering caused by the noise

homeless people seeking shelter from freezing 
temperatures gathered friday in a subway concourse a day after city 
workers demolished a cardboard city that about 75 street people 
had built there 
the city crews thursday morning removed the boxes mattresses 
blankets crates and makeshift furniture that some of the homeless 
had brought to the cavernous underground passageway above one of the 
citys subway lines 
mayor w wilson goode told a news conference that the action was 
only a cleanup not an eviction 
we intend to clean up every day goode said thursday we 
will not forcibly remove the persons who are there 
one homeless man charles twiggs 59 said he didnt blame police 
officers who asked the homeless most of them men to leave to allow 
sanitation workers to clean the area 
thats their duty thats their job said twiggs 
several of the homeless blamed the media in part for the cleanup 
because of extensive coverage of their communal living in the 
concourse 
workers for the philadelphia committee for the homeless arrived 
thursday night to bring food for the returning homeless 
several members of a philadelphia church prayed in a circle with 
about eight homeless men and workers from cityfunded shelters 
stopped by to gather the few who were willing to go with them 
police said they would not prevent people from returning to the 
concourse which the homeless have used for shelter for a decade 
terry ryan 19 had assembled one of the most elaborate cardboard 
homes using wire and two metal poles to combine several smaller 
boxes into a 7by14foot shelter with plastic sheets to cut down 
drafts 
by thursday morning the shelter was disassembled 
the police captain came to my door and asked me to tell 
everyone to get out ryan said i had three beds a table and 
chair heat had running water 
ryan who said he has been homeless for more than a year said he 
lived at the broad street subway concourse for the past 2 months 
with five friends in his condo 
other homeless people said they were permitted to take what 
belongings they could carry when the cleanup began 
police capt lawrence norton said the homeless left the concourse 
on their own thursday morning weve had no problems he said 
police had planned to evict the homeless officially from the 
concourse a police spokeswoman cpl theresa young said she did

a new immigration policy taking effect 
today in the lower rio grande valley will prevent thousands of latin 
american aliens seeking asylum in the united states from getting 
jobs and discourage them from traveling 
advocates for the aliens said the measure will sharply limit the 
number of people granted asylum and cause overcrowding that could 
overwhelm area social services 
omer g sewell harlingen district director for the immigration 
and naturalization service said the new procedure which is also 
being followed in miami and los angeles will make it tougher to 
file frivolous applications for political asylum 
were going to provide almost instant service here in the rio 
grande valley and give them answers here and give them answers 
quickly sewell said 
under the new policy asylum applications will be processed 
within 30 days and applicants cannot work while awaiting a 
decision sewell said 
aliens must also present their asylum applications at their point 
of entry in the united states on a given appointment date a new 
procedure that does not actually prohibit immigrants from leaving 
the area but makes travel unlikely 
previously applications could take several months to process 
aliens were allowed to travel to their us destinations and present 
their asylum applications there and they were generally allowed to 
work in the meantime 
but officials here and in such popular destinations as miami and 
los angeles say they are overwhelmed by the steadily increasing tide 
of applicants 
about 2000 applicants arrive at the harlingen office each week 
compared to a total of 405 for all of 1987 according to ins 
records south texas is the closest and most popular crossing point 
for undocumented aliens from central america 
nearly 30000 people primarily central americans have applied 
for asylum with the ins in harlingen since may 30 
we are a outraged about this new policy at the immigration 
service because what its going to do is hold people even longer in 
the valley intensifying the problem that were already seeing with 
homeless refugees in the streets in shelters and in the motels 
said brian szittai chairman of the rio grande valley refugee rights 
coalition 
it sets up a procedure where i would be surprised if more than 
1 or 2 percent are approved said mark schneider an attorney with 
proyecto libertad a harlingen legal office that assists central 
americans you have adjudicators who are predisposed to denial and 
its going to be a masquerade 
the ins plans to send six additional adjudicators to harlingen 
early next year sewell said 
were going to provide almost instant service here in the rio 
grande valley and give them answers here and give them answers 
quickly he said 
more than half of the asylum applicants are nicaraguans there is 
a nationwide backlog of 21000 pending asylum applications from 
nicaraguans including 11000 pending in the valley officials said 
those denied asylum will receive letters telling them to leave 
the country within 30 days sewell said applicants have the right 
to appeal through the immigration court the executive office of 
immigration review

a college student with a criminal record 
received too stiff a sentence when he was sent to prison for 15 
years because he owned an old west sixshooter that didnt work a 
federal appeals court ruled 
kevin sherbondy 23 of san clemente was arrested in 1986 on the 
day the federal career criminal law went into effect the law 
mandated a 15year sentence with no possibility of parole when a 
person with three convictions for violent felonies was found guilty 
of being an exfelon in possession of a gun 
the unanimous decision thursday by a threejudge panel of the 9th 
us circuit court of appeals came 25 months after sherbondy was 
sent to lompoc penitentiary the 30page opinion upheld the 
gunpossession conviction but ordered a new sentence hearing in us 
district court in los angeles 
sherbondys attorney dennis riordan said he will argue that his 
client be released 
trial testimony showed the gun did not work and that sherbondy 
never used it after it was given to him as a gift when he was 16 
his grandparents who reared him said he kept the gun strapped to 
his bedpost as a souvenier 
the judges ruled that only two of sherbondys previous 
convictions both robberies qualified as violent crimes in the 
third sherbondy was placed on three years probation for urging a 
friend not to testify in a cocaine case 
riordan said sherbondy held two parttime jobs while making the 
honor roll in college before his conviction on the gun charge 
riordan was hired to represent sherbondy by a group of people 
concerned about his plight the group included former san francisco 
police chief con murphy and state court of appeals justice william

december a decline of 14 percent from 1987 said ministry official 
mordechai ben ari 
before the uprising began a year ago in the occupied west bank 
and gaza strip the ministry was predicting that 1988 would be a 
record tourism year because it coincided with the 40th anniversary 
of israels founding 
but hotel managers said this will be a blue christmas 
this is the worst christmas ive ever had said mustafa 
hamed manager of the 65bed galil hotel in the northern israeli

energy department officials met behind 
closed doors today with the governors of three western states in an 
attempt to resolve an impasse over storage of radioactive waste from 
nuclear weapons plants 
the governors of idaho colorado and new mexico conferred with 
joseph salgado chief deputy to energy secretary john herrington 
and other regional doe officials 
i think all of us come here expecting to find a solution 
colorado gov roy romer said outside the hotel meeting room we 
ought to solve it today 
the immediate problem is finding a storage site for the 
equivalent of 24 boxcars of radioactive material from the rocky 
flats nuclear weapons plant near denver seven boxcars of the 
nuclear waste are sitting outside the plant 
romer said rocky flats which manufactures plutonium for weapons 
will reach its capacity for temporary storage between march and may 
at which point he will require the governmentoperated plant to 
suspend production 
waste has been stacking up there since october when idaho gov 
cecil andrus turned away a boxcar headed for the idaho national 
engineering laboratory and said the state would accept no more 
shipments 
the other question taken up today is when the government will 
open a permanent waste storage site in new mexico the facility will 
hold contaminated equipment and clothing in salt deposits more than 
2000 feet underground 
on thursday romer said the facility is not expected to open 
before rocky flats reaches capacity 
doug elmet a doe spokesman in washington said thursday the 
purpose of the meeting was to provide a chance for some straight 
talk between the governors and the federal government 
andrus said today he would not open the idaho national 
engineering laboratory to shipments until the new mexico facility 
opens and doe outlines a plan to remove more than 4 million cubic 
feet of waste from the lab 
don caviness spokesman for new mexico gov garrey carruthers 
said his boss wants the energy department to provide a firm deadline 
for opening the storage facility and an update on 240 million the 
state has been promised 
the money is to be used to build bypasses around major cities 
through which waste would be shipped and to compensate for lost 
mining royalties 
caviness said carruthers would not permit the new mexico facility

the number of active polio cases in the western 
hemisphere has dropped from thousands in latin america alone in the 
1970s to around 300 so far this year giving hope the disease can be 
eliminated in the region by 1990 
ciro de quadros a brazilian epidemiologist told a group at the 
johns hopkins school of public health on thursday that the public 
health strides against the disease compare only to those against 
smallpox 
so far this year thanks to mass inoculations of children in the 
crowded barrios and remote villages of latin america health 
officials say the number of cases of the musclewasting disease has 
been reduced to a few hundred de quadros said the decline has 
encouraged the pan american health organization to believe that 
polio can be wiped out in the region within the next two years 
we are extremely confident that the target can be met said 
de quadros an epidemiologist who is directing the polio eradication 
program in the americas for the subsidiary of the world health 
organization 
its very hard work the wild virus circulates in crowded urban 
areas with poor sanitation and we have guys out there working in 
countries with civil war he said but they have a true sense of 
accomplishment theyre doing something that has been done only once 
before with smallpox 
polio which attacks the nerves that control muscles and often 
strikes children began to fade from the united states and western 
europe after the introduction of the injectable salk vaccine in 1955 
the oral sabin vaccine followed shortly thereafter and polio 
vaccinations were made part of the standard childrens immunization 
schedule 
the world health organization estimates there are 270000 polio 
cases annually with more than half of those in india

from wearing gold jewelry leather or fur coats and torn clothing at 
middle and senior high schools 
the dress code presented thursday by school superintendent 
richard c hunter takes effect in february the rules similar to 
others adopted in detroit and new orleans are part of an effort to 
stem school violence 
a task force on violence appointed by hunter proposed adopting a 
dress code along with other measures after a student was shot in a 
corridor at edmondsonwestside high school in october 
the code will set the standard for what is unacceptable said 
jacquelyn hardy spokesman for the school system each school will 
adopt its own dress code to tell children what they should wear 
this just tells them what they shouldnt wear 
hunter said students would be given time to conform to the new 
dress code but said violators probably would be sent home at 
principals discretion 
other items offlimits under the code include sweat suits or 
jogging outfits multiple rings or precious nonschool rings 
pajamatype attire hair rollers or curlers slippers shorts 
halter tops seethrough tops and apparel printed with vulgar or 
obscene statements or statements related to the use of drugs 
alcohol sex or violence 
joyce quarles an english teacher at city college said clothing 
often causes tension because of competition among students seeking 
to outdress others she said students have means of selfexpression 
besides clothing 
dress is one intellectual development is another clothing can 
detract from the business of education at first the students didnt 
see that but they came around

a russian orthodox priest with only 40 left to 
keep his jobs center open says the hard times are forcing him to 
sell his prized possessions two 19thcentury french lithographs 
the rev john daecheck who operates the nonprofit new times 
service center in nearby glassport to help unemployed steel workers 
has an overdue telephone bill of several hundred dollars and he has 
already tapped businesses in the depressed monongahela valley for 
donations 
to raise money he placed classified ads in pittsburgh newspapers 
wednesday and thursday offering two works by french artists honore 
daumier and jacques villone for a total of 500 he estimates they 
are worth 500 to 1500 each 
i have to do what i have to do and if i look stupid doing it 
thats too bad ive had these for 20 years but to keep the place 
going id sell them he said 
daecheck 42 received 10 such lithographs as gifts when he was a 
businessman nearly 20 years ago the two are all that remain 
slowly and surely through my life whenever a financial crunch 
came up i would sell one he said im terrible at asking for 
money it kind of tears something out of you to have to do that 
daecheck assistant pastor of a small independent church in 
washington pa founded the center seven months ago with 800 of 
his own money and a monthly 50 stipend from his church jobseekers 
are asked but not required to make a 2 donation for job leads and 
a 5 donation for resume help 
the agency staffed by volunteers has provided about 900 
laidoff steel workers and others with a free fast and simple way 
to find employment and job training 
on a wall in the cramped storefront office are about 1000 job 
listings which are updated daily volunteers also help jobseekers 
with resumes and career counseling and steer them to other agencies 
if they need clothing food or a place to live 
i wanted to do something to help alleviate the unemployment 
problem in our area daecheck said it seemed there were so many 
people taking advantage of others with job services many of which 
charge fees of 60 or 80 what if you dont have any money that 
60 or 80 could be someones rent money 
dennis saputo 34 of lincoln said he turned to the center when 
other agencies failed to help the agency recently found training 
for him in asbestos abatement and volunteers helped him fill out a 
resume 
ive been on public assistance and have gone through their 
programs and quite frankly theyre a joke they go through the 
motions to help you but they really dont help said saputo 
this place here makes you feel good they will do everything 
they can to help you get going its the best program ive ever 
dealt with and ive dealt with enough to know

france has been hit with its worst flu epidemic in 
20 years and by christmas one in five people will have suffered 
from high fever aching bones stuffy nose and other unpleasant flu 
symptoms doctors say 
the flu has hit harder and earlier than ever before said dr 
jeanmarie cohen head of frances regional groups for influenza 
observation 
cohen a general practitioner said one in three patients he 
treats have la grippe 
the epidemic is currently making its way south from northern 
france where it surfaced two weeks ago to the riviera where it is 
expected to peak during the holiday season 
more than 2 million people have been struck so far with this 
years variety which doctors attribute to the ah1n1 virus it is 
affecting mostly young adults and schoolage children 
the ah1n1 virus caused a major outbreak of flu in the late 
1940s so people over 40 are likely to be immune to it said karin 
esteves of the division of communicable diseases at the world health 
organization in geneva 
cohen said the virus first appeared during the summer in britain 
but did not reach epidemic proportions czechoslovakia was hard hit 
in early fall and sweden is now in the grip of the flu 
the ah1n1 virus also has turned up in canada and the united 
states with cases reported in arizona michigan maryland texas 
south dakota and hawaii he said 
in the french city of nantes on the atlantic coast about 30 
percent of schoolage children have been bedridden with the flu and 
in some scattered towns around france schools have been closed 
some doctors say recent transit strikes can be blamed for the 
flus rapid spread in the greater paris region 
many of my patients have walked miles in the cold and rain to 
get to work said dr joseph danon an ear nose and throat 
specialist and when they do catch buses or subways theyre 
crammed in like sardines an ideal way to spread germs 
cohen said it was virtually impossible to know why the flu struck 
so early this year especially since the weather in november was 
relatively mild 
in 1968 more than 30000 people died throughout france during a 
flu epidemic that lasted three weeks 
cohen was more optimistic for this years epidemic because a 
vaccination against the virus has been on the market since early 
oct with 12 percent of the population vaccinated it is expected to 
reduce incidence of the flu by 20 percent 
though doctors say the flu does not rank among the serious 
illnesses it does cost the french economy billions of dollars 
in 1985 workers missed 16 million days of work because of flu 
costing the french economy 15 billion many companies have begun 
vaccinating employees free of charge or for a nominal sum 
french pharmaceutical companies however did not produce enough 
vaccine to meet the demand and many pharmacies are sold out

housing construction in november reached its 
highest level in seven months the government said friday in a 
report cited as further evidence of a robust economy 
the commerce department said new homes and apartments were built 
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 156 million units last 
month up 14 percent from the october rate of 154 million 
it was the third increase in a row and the highest level of 
construction activity since april housing starts soared 51 percent 
in october and rose 04 percent in september 
housing permits a good barometer of future housing activity 
edged up 01 percent to a rate of 152 million units the highest 
level since june 1987 the slight gain followed a robust 88 percent 
increase in october 
the strength surprised analysts who for many months have been 
saying that rising interest rates would dampen the housing sector 
activity this year is down from last year but not by as much as 
expected 
home buyers are simply either ignoring or looking through all 
the uncertainty that surrounds interest rates and saying hey 
ive got a job things look pretty good my company is growing its 
time to buy a house said james christian chief economist of the 
us league of savings institutions 
he cited an unemployment rate near 14year lows and strong sales 
of new homes from june through october which pushed the backlog of 
unsold homes below a sixmonth supply for the first time in a year 
and a half 
builders are going to build them if people are going to buy 
them he said 
nevertheless economists say mortgage rates will probably edge 
higher through the middle of next year and will eventually take 
their toll on housing a higher rate increases monthly mortgage 
payments 
rates on fixedrate mortgages which fell from about 10 percent 
in midaugust to 10 percent in late october have since climbed 
back to nearly 10 percent according to the federal home loan 
mortgage corp 
the housing industry is clearly slowing down there are 
some areas of the country still doing fairly well but others have 
slowed significantly said kent colton executive vice president 
of the national association of home builders 
he predicted housing starts would total 15 million this year 
down from 162 million last year and a recent peak of 181 million 
in 1986 next year they will head still lower to about 137 
million he said 
for the first 11 months of the year starts were running 91 
percent behind the same period of last year 
singlefamily homes in november were built at a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 115 million units the highest since march 
and up 08 percent from a month earlier singlefamily starts shot 
up 93 percent in october 
apartment construction a volatile subcategory rose 30 percent 
last month to 412000 units after a 52 percent decline in october 
because of high vacancy rates and less favorable tax treatment of 
real estate investment apartment starts are running far below their 
1986 peak of 669000 units 
by region housing starts shot up 129 percent in the northeast 
to 228000 units they rose 48 percent in the south to 612000 
units the highest rate in a year starts dropped 83 percent in the 
middle west and fell 22 percent in the west 
housing activity has been strong in california in recent months 
because of brisk population growth and weak in the northeast partly 
because of high prices

a group that promotes peace handed out teddy 
bears friday to youngsters who dumped their war toys in a trash can 
at a day care center 
we encouraged children to bring in a toy that promotes violence 
and they received a cuddly teddy bear said margaret matthews the 
toledo ywcas child care director and member of the ywcas peace 
coalition 
the idea that we are trying to share with children and parents 
is that war toys scare bears and disarmament begins at home when 
you educate children about nonviolence and peaceful playthings 
she said 
the children brought in a gamut of toys ranging from uzi 
submachine guns that squirt water to batterypowered tanks in 
exchange the group handed out 32 teddy bears 
they were very much aware of what was going to happen they put 
the toys right in the trash can and went over and got their bears 
and a badge that said war toys scare bears they were real 
pleased she said 
war toys promote violence and aggressive play among children she 
contended 
children do have violence in play and when it is something 
they create on their own without adult influence i do not think 
there is anything really wrong with that 
but when they are playing with airtoground missiles that are 
obviously adultcreated and really created by toy companies then we 
are really influencing their play too much

president pw botha marked the 
afrikaners most sacred day friday by calling for racial cooperation 
in south africa but a rival celebration by rightist afrikaners 
protested recent racial reforms 
friday marked the 150th anniversary of the great trek that took 
white settlers into the african wilderness on wagons drawn by oxen 
we must strive for national unity and for unity in our 
different communities botha told whites gathered at the 
voortrekker monument dedicated to the 19th century settlers 
people from throughout the country arrived in pretoria on wagons 
this week to commemorate the 1838 great trek 
during the original journey one of the pioneer parties vowed on 
dec 16 1838 to make the date sacred if it defeated the zulu army 
led by king dingaan they did so in the battle of blood river 
white brown and black stood together in the laager circled 
wagons at blood river in spite of those who want to suppress this 
fact today in an attempt to justify their own standpoints botha 
said 
his call for unity and his acknowledgement that blacks 
participated in the trek and fought the zulus contrasted sharply 
with the rival celebration staged nearby by rightist afrikaners who 
view bothas recent limited racial reforms as capitulation to the 
nations 26 million black majority 
bothas national party calls for gradual race reforms and limited 
powersharing while the rightwing afrikaners oppose all such 
reform 
this is a demonstration a protest of the afrikaner against 
what is going on in south africa socalled reform said carel 
boshoff leader of the afrikaner volkswag a cultural group 
sponsoring the alternative celebrations 
we do not see race reform only as political change but total 
cultural change boshoff said in an interview we dont think 
its possible for the white south african nation to survive in 
that situation 
both celebrations drew about 10000 people friday 
the great trek the most momentous event in afrikaner history 
began in 1838 when the dutchdescended afrikaners left the 
britishruled cape colony for the countrys uncharted interior 
stories about hardships on the journey and battles with african 
tribesmen have taken on mythical proportions for the countrys 3 
million afrikaners who dominate the government and make up about 60 
percent of the white population 
the government billed its great trek celebrations as open to all 
races but only a handful of blacks participated as drivers of the 
oxen teams 
the farright groups barred blacks from attending their 
ceremonies 
the rightwing groups staged a mock battle of blood river with 
several dozen bearded men in buckskin outfits taking cover behind 
wagons to defeat imaginary zulu warriors there were no actual black 
opponents present only a taped recording of zulu war cries and 
drumbeats 
andries treurnicht leader of the conservative party the chief 
parliamentary opposition told the rightwing rally it is the 
right of the afrikaner nation to be ruled by its own people 
if europes nationalities have the right to live in separate 
countries what is wrong with the white south african nation living 
apart from the nonwhites he said

hopefully used again as it is in this sentence but hes just 
about given up hope 
dr grammar alter ego of english professor richard tracz 
handles 10 to 20 grammatical questions a day on his telephone hot 
line but he says hes all but powerless in the fight against 
erroneous but popular word usage 
tracz author of several textbooks on english composition 
originally established the write line to help students at oakton 
community college in des plaines where he teaches 
the 44yearold tracz is hardly as schoolmarmish as his position 
as a callin grammar guru might imply he said thursday his callers 
are often disappointed when he suggests that they trust their own 
judgment 
thats not to say that there isnt a lost cause tracz is willing 
to fight for without a fondness for lost causes he wouldnt be a 
grammarian in 20thcentury america 
hopefully when its used to mean i hope is one of my pet 
peeves but i cant stop people from using it that way even though 
it makes no sense tracz said 
its a losing battle he admitted itll be like aint 
teachers kept explaining that aint wasnt in the dictionary but 
people kept using it and its in the dictionary now people will 
keep on using hopefully the wrong way until standard usage permits 
it

is it art or is it just weird 
the design for a sculpture featuring an alligator in victorian 
garb pushing an eggshaped baby carriage and other fanciful bronze 
figures is not drawing rave reviews from school board members being 
asked to spend 75000 to place the piece outside a new high school 
members of the montgomery county board of education said this 
week they want to send the art work back to the drawing board 
it is weird said school board member sharon difonzo i 
dont want to say to the artist this is ugly but it doesnt do a 
thing for me and i cant see it doing a thing for watkins mill high 
school 
the 38by39foot sculpture was designed for the courtyard of the 
new high school when it opens next fall in suburban gaithersburg 
about 15 miles northwest of washington dc 
the design shows a bigbeaked bird preening in a renaissance 
costume an archaeologist named dr digwell excavating pots and the 
dressedup alligator pushing a carriage shaped like an egg with 
legs inside the egg a wise old man sits before a computer keyboard 
the sculpture was chosen by a committee of school officials 
parents and students from entries submitted by artists across the 
country 
reached in san francisco the sculptor 36yearold lorraine 
vail defended her work 
what i wanted to do is to make a rather sterile courtyard 
environment into a place where you could hang out ms vail said 
you get to sit on the steps even if it is a little crazy i would 
love to go have lunch with dr digwell or one of the other 
characters

us and plo officials today met for 90 
minutes in their first official direct talks on peace in the middle 
east ending a long us boycott of the palestinian organization 
it is our hope that this dialogue as it develops will help 
bring about direct negotiations that will lead to a comprehensive 
peace us ambassador robert h pelletreau told reporters 
following his meeting with a fourman plo delegation 
he described the discussions as practical and characterized i 
would say by seriousness of purpose 
the first meeting came two days after washington declared that 
plo chairman yasser arafats recent statements on renouncing 
terrorism and recognizing israel met conditions for beginning 
contacts 
it took place in an official tunisian government guest residence 
in suburban carthage north of tunis yasser abdrabbou a member of 
the plo executive committee led the palestinian delegation 
abdrabbou called the first session practical and 
constructive and said he expected the next usplo meeting would 
come within several weeks 
we hope this dialogue will bring us closer to an international 
conference on the middle east he said we hope this dialogue 
will continue and we think it will continue 
in madrid a spanish foreign ministry official speaking on 
condition of anonymity said pelletreau had been holding meetings 
this year with plo representatives under the auspices of the spanish 
embassy in tunis 
pelletreau has denied any previous meetings with the plo 
western diplomatic sources in tunis briefing reporters on the 
condition that they not be more precisely identified said earlier 
today that there would be no detailed exchanges at the meeting and 
that afterward it was likely there would be a period of 
assessment 
the american side had planned to open the meeting with a clear 
statement of washingtons attitude toward terrorism and say the 
united states expected arafats words would be matched by his 
actions a highranking diplomatic source said 
the united states expects that the plos renunciation of 
terrorism will be prominent and pervasive a diplomatic source 
said but also understands that arafat does not control all 
palestinians nor all acts of terrorism 
the sources said washington would expect the plo to dissociate 
itself clearly from any future acts of terrorism 
the second american agenda item according to the sources would 
be a statement of washingtons general principles and approach to 
middle east peace 
pelletreau once held hostage by palestinians telephoned plo 
headquarters thursday to make the initial official contact 
according to the plo and us embassy spokesman adnan siddiqi 
secretary of state george p shultz designated pelletreau as the 
us governments only authorized channel of communication with 
the plo 
today in tunis palestinian flags appeared in the front of many 
homes and businesses news reports said 
arafat was not in tunis and it wasnt known when he would return 
he met east german leader erich honecker in berlin on thursday 
before heading to romania 
east germany was one of the first countries to recognize the 
independent palestinian state declared by plo leaders at a meeting 
last month 
pelletreau ambassador to tunisia since march 1987 is one of the 
most experienced and knowledgeable american diplomats on arab 
affairs 
the long island native speaks arabic and french and has served in 
algeria morocco mauritania lebanon jordan and syria he once was 
ambassador to bahrain 
his first encounter with palestinian terrorism came in september 
1970 when guerrillas of george habashs extremist plo faction 
diverted three airliners to amman jordan and took the passengers 
and crews hostage he later escaped

a 41yearold swede with a long criminal 
record pleaded innocent friday to killing prime minister olof palme 
in a case that has frustrated this orderly nation for nearly three 
years 
christer pettersson was arraigned at stockholm district court 
and a judge ordered him held for further questioning press reports 
hailed his arrest wednesday as a breakthrough in the investigation 
palme a fourterm prime minister who championed leftist causes 
human rights and disarmament was killed feb 28 1986 while walking 
home unguarded from a late movie in downtown stockholm with his wife 
the assassination shocked sweden which prides itself on its 
orderliness tolerance and lack of political violence 
public records show pettersson has a history of psychiatric 
treatment and drug and alcohol abuse 
his record includes convictions for at least 63 offenses 
including manslaughter for stabbing an alleged drug addict to death 
with a bayonet in 1970 a few blocks from where palme was killed 
pettersson covered his face with his hands as police escorted him 
into a room at police headquarters where the hearing was held for 
security reasons 
chief prosecutor anders helin argued that there were reasonable 
grounds to believe pettersson killed palme and that he should be 
held while the state builds a case for trial 
district court judge mikael af geijerstam found for the 
prosecution at the closed negotiations but ruled that pettersson 
must be formally charged before dec 30 prosecutors can extend his 
detention indefinitely by showing cause 
swedish press accounts said witnesses picked pettersson out of a 
lineup as the man who was seen loitering outside the grand theater 
while palme was inside watching a swedish film the mozart 
brothers with his wife lisbet 
the gunman followed the palmes down the street and shot the prime 
minister at close range with a 357caliber magnum revolver lisbet 
was slightly wounded the weapon has not been found and 
investigators have offered no motive for the shooting 
tabloid press accounts quoting friends of pettersson say he 
belonged to a nationalist group with neonazi sympathies and made no 
secret of his hate for palme a social democrat other stories 
portrayed him as a heavy drinker and drug user with no politics 
arne liljeros the public defender representing pettersson said 
he was not surprised by the courts decision 
we defended ourselves as well as we could he said 
helin and chief detective hans olvebro met with reporters after 
the hearing but refused to answer substantive questions about the 
case 
olvebro the third man to head the investigation took over in 
february after two years of public infighting between police and 
prosecutors and after government commissions accused police of 
incompetence

friday shot and killed a parttime soldier and set a oneweek 
deadline for the wives and children of british soldiers to leave 
northern ireland 
the outlawed guerrilla group which launched a campaign in march 
against british servicemen made it clear that it regarded the mens 
families as legitimate targets 
the deadline for the wives and children was the first set by the 
ira which is fighting to drive the british out of northern ireland 
and unite the mainly protestant province with the overwhelmingly 
roman catholic irish republic 
the ira from today is giving seven days to the british army to 
evacuate their families from the north of ireland after that the 
responsibility for casualties rests solely with them the group 
said in a statement telexed to news media in belfast 
the statement was signed p oneill a traditional ira signature 
about 10500 british troops are deployed in northern ireland all 
living in barracks complexes the british army refused to comment on 
the warning or say how many had their families with them but 
unofficial estimates put the figure at between 1500 and 2000 
the ira threat followed three bomb attacks on british army 
married quarters in the past month one on the outskirts of 
londonderry one at lisburn where the army is headquartered and one 
at antrim no one was injured 
the ira claimed responsibility for the slaying friday of an 
offduty soldier the victim was a member of the locally recruited 
ulster defense regiment attached to the british army 
john moreland 37 from clough county down was the 12th member 
of the 6280strong regiment killed this year and the 94th victim of 
sectarian violence this year he was married and had two children 
police said two gunmen fired at close range into the cab of the 
truck friday morning as the soldier drove into a roman catholic 
workingclass district of downpatrick county down 30 miles 
southeast of belfast 
the attackers fled in a car which had been stolen from a family 
that was held hostage by gunmen in a nearby public housing estate 
police said the car was later found abandoned 
nearly 3000 people have been killed since britain sent troops 
into northern ireland in 1969 including 179 men from the ulster 
defense regiment 
the iras stepped up targeting of british servicemen since march 
has claimed 44 casualties the toll includes four servicemen who

they only moved in a month ago but the 
guest list for a couple who have set up a christmas spectacle 
outside their new home is starting to run into the tens of thousands 
john and gloria mackoul say they have averaged 1000 visitors 
nightly to the house they had barely finished building in november 
when they unveiled a display of lights trees and christmas 
characters live and mechanical 
i guess were so happy we wanted everyone else to be too 
said gloria mackoul just to see the faces of the children is 
enough for me 
the display includes three christmas trees at their picture 
windows and one in a loft 40 moving dolls on their octagonal 
staircase lifesized mechanical reindeer and carolers 30 disney 
characters on the front lawn and several friends and neighbors 
acting as rudolph the rednosed reindeer frosty the snowman mrs 
frosty and assorted helpers 
mrs mackoul said she and her husband an electrical contractor 
designed the house just for the christmas spectacle that they have 
planned for years even the carpenters who built the house donated 
their services to make a stable for the lifesized nativity scene 
that was lifted by crane onto a ledge in the front yard 
and the mackouls show the spectacle for free 
a lot of people come in and are very skeptical they walk out 
and are very moved mrs mackoul said 
word about the house has spread so fast through the central 
massachusetts city of 180000 people that the mackouls get thankyou 
cards addressed only to the christmas house 
their doors are open nightly until dec 24 when santa takes off 
to deliver presents but the house reopens from dec 26 to new 
years eve the couple counts 1200 visitors on weekend nights and 
they average 900 on weekdays 
their neighbors in the expensive development have not raised a 
fuss about the sudden stream of guests we havent heard one 
complaint and the traffic is unbelievable she said 
one neighbor an orthodox jew even dons a moose suit every night 
to entertain children 
the couple have collected christmas figures for years with an eye 
to the production their daughter jennifer 15 made the disney 
figures for the yard 
the nativity figures were imported from italy with the vacation 
money the couple had saved 
the mackouls who have lived their entire lives in the grafton 
hill section of the city hosted a smaller version of the christmas 
spectacle in their former apartment there but most of the guests 
were neighborhood children 
they prepared this years display behind shaded windows in the 
weeks before thanksgiving to keep it secret the lights went on 
thanksgiving night and within minutes cars began stopping 
their visitors have included a motorcycle rider in black leather 
who thanked them profusely and children without coats 
mrs mackoul said older visitors are particularly touched by the 
display 
we have people crying sometimes they cant believe were 
letting them in the house she said

a woman whose son was born addicted to 
cocaine was charged friday with child abuse and delivery of the drug 
to her baby a felony drug charge prosecutors say has never been 
used against a new mother 
michael hudson was born nov 13 addicted to cocaine and infected 
with syphilis he has been treated and placed in a foster home 
awaiting adoption 
his mother toni suzette hudson 29 was arrested thursday on a 
street corner known for drug sales she remained in custody in the 
seminole county jail in lieu of 2000 bond 
other florida prosecutors have charged mothers of addicted babies 
with child abuse but never with violating drug laws said jeff 
deen seminolebrevard assistant state attorney 
conviction of child abuse generally carries a sentence of no more 
than 60 days the drug charge carries a maximum sentence of 30 years 
deen said he could prosecute ms hudson for delivering the drug 
because state law defines it simply as a transfer from one person to 
another he plans to argue that the mother transferred the drug to 
michael by ingesting it 
ms hudson who is unemployed and lives just east of altamonte 
springs gave birth to michael at florida hospital altamonte where 
urine tests showed the infant and mother had cocaine in their bodies 
the hospital reported the case to the state department of health 
and rehabilitative services as required by law when pregnant women 
appear to be drug users 
hrs investigator patsy buckley interviewed ms hudson four days 
after michael was born according to the arrest report the mother 
admitted using cocaine almost daily throughout her pregnancy the 
report says 
ms hudson told investigators she had used cocaine for about 
three years and even used the drug while in labor before entering 
the hospital 
buckley advised that hudson told her that she was not addicted 
to crack cocaine but tremendously enjoyed using crack cocaine and 
it made her life worthwhile the arrest report says 
michaels cocaine addiction was sufficient evidence for deen to 
subpoena ms hudsons hospital records which showed cocaine in her 
body a pediatrics expert told investigators the only way a newborn 
could be addicted to cocaine would be if the mother used the drug 
next week authorities plan to arrest three more women on child 
abuse charges the women being sought followed a similar pattern of 
drug abuse sheriffs spokesman roy hughey said

a man who helped sell substandard electrical 
wire used in nuclear submarines and then apologized in a 26000 
newspaper ad for defrauding the defense department was sentenced 
friday to 4 years in prison 
i was very very wrong and im sorry lawrence koffler 54 
of providence ri told us district judge clifford scott green 
fighting back tears 
however the judge turned down a defense plea for probation 
because the offenses are very serious 
besides the prison term koffler was fined 15000 ordered to 
pay 47000 for the cost of prosecution given three years 
probation when he is released from prison and ordered to perform 750 
hours of community service during that probationary period 
in a pleabargain agreement 13 months ago koffler pleaded guilty 
to one count of conspiracy to defraud five counts of mail fraud and 
two counts of filing false income tax returns 
he previously made restitution to the government of 475000 and 
paid 37 million to settle his income tax liabilities 
koffler cooperated with the government during its lengthy 
investigation of conspiracy bribery tax evasion and mail fraud 
charges that overall resulted in conviction either at trial or 
through guilty pleas of 43 defendants in a scheme that defrauded 
the defense department of more than 5 million 
last week in an advertisement he placed in the philadelphia 
inquirer koffler said he was disgusted with what i had done and 
appealed to others who do business with the government to avoid 
cheating 
please learn a lesson from my mistakes he said in the ad 
dont make the almighty dollar the guiding force for your business 
decisions if only one person learns from my mistakes then 
something good has come out of this 
the government said it demanded a prison term because koffler as 
vice president of marketing for carol wire and cable co of 
pawtucket ri was critical in carrying out the scheme 
assistant us attorney karl lunkenheimer said carol in its 
sales to companies that shipped the wire to the defense industrial 
supply center in philadelphia made product substitutions that were 
extremely dangerous 
substituting tincoated wire for silvercoated when used in 
guided missiles nuclear submarines tanks jet bomberfighters and 
other critical military systems created a risk of the destruction of 
extremely expensive military equipment and the crews involved in 
using it lunkenheimer said in a memorandum 
kofflers lawyer thomas ostrander said the sentence wasnt 
what we expected but mr koffler thinks it is fair

greece will tell the united states by the 
end of the year to start closing us military bases but 
negotiations for a new agreement will continue into 1989 the 
government announced friday 
government spokesman sotiris kostopoulos said the current 
fiveyear operating agreement for the four american bases ends on 
dec 20 and the 17month removal period begins 
during that period the conditions of the agreement remain in 
force kostopoulos said in a statement 
the statement was issued after greek and american negotiators 
ended a 12th round of talks in athens on friday 
negotiations for a new bases agreement began in november 1987 but 
have made little progress 
the spokesman said negotiations will continue into 1989 and 
during the entire 17month removal period to ascertain the margins 
existing for a possible new agreement he said another round of 
talks will begin in january 
kostopoulos said that in this weeks talks although a deadlock 
was not reached a considerable gap in views continues to exist on 
many issues 
in washington a state department official said important 
differences remain but the negotiations are not at an impasse the 
official spoke on condition of anonymity 
talks broke off in september when greece said that hellenikon air 
force base adjacent to athens airport would not be included in a new 
agreement and would have to close 
negotiations resumed in october after foreign minister carolos 
papoulias discussed the issue with secretary of state george p 
shultz in washington 
kostopoulos statement noted greeces decision to shut down 
hellenikon 
about 1400 servicemen 200 civilian employees and 700 greeks 
work at the base set up in the late 1940s to help distribute 
marshal plan aid to wartorn greece 
hellenikon has been an irritant to nationalist and leftist groups 
opposed to the us presence in greece 
the spokesman also repeated a greek demand that a new agreement 
would have to serve greeces highest national interests and said 
a new accord would have to be approved in a national referendum 
before it is signed 
greece wants a new accord to guarantee that the us will help it 
solve some of its longstanding disputes with neighboring turkey the 
two nato allies are at odds over military control of the aegean sea 
its seabed mineral rights and cyprus which is divided into greek 
and turkish sectors 
us officials dont want to involve regional politics in the 
bases talks 
three other bases have been operating in greece since the early 
1950s a navy communications station near athens a 6th fleet 
supply base at souda bay on the island of crete and an air force 
electronic listening post at gournes also on crete 
the united states pays greece more than 430 million a year in 
military credits as a form of rent for use of the bases 
the government of socialist premier andreas papandreou has been 
under heavy pressure to remove the bases and the pressure is likely 
to increase during the campaign for elections in june

a jury deliberated friday for the second 
day in the tax and mail fraud conspiracy trial of political maverick 
lyndon h larouche jr 
when they left for lunch at midday the eight women and four men 
had debated the complex case against larouche and six associates for 
eight hours beginning thursday 
chief us district judge albert v bryan jr has said they 
should be prepared to work through saturday if necessary to decide 
all 48 counts involved 
larouche 66 a perennial independent presidential candidate and 
the six aides were charged with mail fraud and conspiracy for 
allegedly raising more than 30 million in loans from supporters 
without any intention of repaying them 
larouche was charged separately with conspiring to defraud the 
internal revenue service by having all his personal expenses paid by 
various corporations he controls and claiming he had no taxable 
income 
larouche has not filed federal income tax returns for any year 
since 1978 government prosecutors say if convicted of all 13 
counts against him larouche faces a maximum penalty of 65 years in 
prison and 325 million in fines 
the six other defendants who face lesser penalties if convicted 
are william wertz who was in charge of fund raising for larouche 
edward spannaus larouches legal coordinator and fundraisers 
michael billington paul greenberg joyce rubinstein and dennis 
small 
larouche did not testify in his own defense during the 15day 
trial 
defense lawyers said larouche and the others were innocent of all 
charges they said the loans were solicited with goodfaith 
assurances that they would be repaid 
government prosecutors countered that everybody in the larouche 
organization knew that they were part of a bankruptcy waiting to 
happen and lied when they told prospective lenders that the terms 
of the loans would be honored 
assistant us attorney kent robinson told the jurors that 
larouche and his followers had perpetrated an enormous crime a 
30 million crime larouches chief lawyer odin anderson of 
boston said the government was charging a voodoo conspiracy 
without any evidence to support its allegations

major differences remain in negotiations over 
the leases on us military bases in greece which expire next week 
the state department said friday 
the latest round of talks which have been going on since 
november 1987 was completed friday and another session was 
scheduled for january said spokesman charles redman 
but redman said that if the negotiations fail the bases would 
have to close 17 months from the dec 20 expiration date 
important differences remain on many issues but the 
negotiators are not at an impasse said redman 
both sides right now indicate that it is our intention to try 
to work together to reach a mutually agreeable decision to 
continue he added 
the biggest bone of contention is the hellenikon air force base 
outside athens which is a particular irritant to greek nationalists 
resentful of the us presence in their country 
greece announced in september that it would close down the 
facility once the lease expires but the united states contends the 
hellenikon base is part of the overall negotiations which have yet 
to be resolved 
about 1400 servicemen 200 civilian employees and 700 greeks 
work at the base opened in the late 1940s to help distribute 
marshal plan aid to the wartorn country 
nationalists have urged greek premier andreas papandreou to eject 
the united states and the pressure on him is likely to mount during 
the campaign for june elections 
three other us bases have been operating in greece since the 
early 1950s a navy communications station near athens a 6th fleet 
supply base at souda bay in crete and an air force electronic 
listening post at gournes also on crete 
the united states pays the greek government more than 430 
million a year in credit for military armaments as a form of rent 
for the bases and for some 20 additional communications posts in 
greece

serve greeces highest national interests and would have to be

despite large november increases for gasoline 
and heating oil wholesale prices continue to rise at an annual rate 
of less than 4 percent the government said friday confounding 
predictions of a mounting inflation problem 
wholesale prices edged up just 03 percent in november as food 
costs at the wholesale level showed no increases for the second 
straight month the labor department said 
the november increase if it persisted for 12 months would 
amount to an annual inflation rate of just 33 percent lower than 
the 38 percent annualized rate for the first 11 months of 1987 
inflationary fears exceed inflationary reality at the present 
time said donald ratajczak director of economic forecasting at 
georgia state university in atlanta 
those fears were aggravated earlier this week when the government 
reported that industrial production rose another half a percentage 
point in november and that factories were operating at a nineyear 
high of 842 percent of their capacity 
dirk van dongen president of the national association of 
wholesalersdistributors said he sees no indication from the 
associations 45000 member companies that they are building 
inventories in anticipation of future price spikes 
van dongen called the inflationary fears a manifestation of 
tribal rites in washington and on the new york financial circuits 
with the changing of presidential administrations 
lets keep the debate a little bit honest he said i dont 
see an inflationary psychology taking root but washington can talk 
itself into all sorts of things theres a lot of speculation 
swirling around about policy the federal reserve what a new 
administration is going to do 
gasoline prices rose 34 percent and home heating oil skyrocketed 
122 percent despite a 05 percent drop in crude oil prices natural 
gas prices however fell 25 percent sending overall energy prices 
up just 12 percent heating oil prices had fallen 10 percent the 
previous month 
even with the big spikes in energy there just isnt a whole 
lot of inflation out there said sandra shaber an economist for 
the futures group a washington consulting group to have that 
you have to find things that become chronic and you just dont see 
that anywhere 
ratajczak said the gasoline and heating oil price increases may 
be partly due to the establishment of new production quotas last 
month by the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
oil prices probably will end this year slightly higher than 
originally expected because of response to the latest opec 
agreement ratajczak said 
however he added that the opec agreement will become 
unmanageable by by next spring and prices will fall again 
moderating price increases for chemcials and plastics as well 
food prices which the summer drought had pushed up at an annual 
rate of 8 percent showed no overall change last month after falling 
01 percent in october 
prices for fresh fruits jumped 94 percent while those for 
canned fruits and vegetables gained 11 percent 
pork and beef prices each dropped by about half a percentage 
point large declines also were recorded for a wide variety of other 
food items with egg prices off 145 percent rice down 27 percent 
pasta products off 47 percent chickens off 74 percent turkeys 
down 41 percent and coffee off 29 percent 
grocery shoppers can expect even better news in the months ahead 
the labor departments price index for crude foodstuffs such as 
grains and livestock fell 6 percent in november the largest monthly 
drop since june 1974 
finished goods other than food and energy posted a 03 percent 
gain the same as the overall rate price gains accelerated 
however for prescription drugs detergents books and newspapers 
after falling a month earlier prices turned upward for household 
appliances overthecounter drugs jewelry and sporting goods 
wholesale automobile prices were off 01 percent after a 17 
percent decline in october capital equipment costs rose 03 
percent erasing a decline of the same magnitude in october 
in the increasing concern about inflation many have failed to 
note that industrial commodity prices have increased less in 1988 
than in 1987 ratajczak said 
the overall november increase left the producer price index for 
finished goods at 1097 meaning that a hypothetical selection of 
goods costing 100 in 1982 would have cost 10970 last month 40 
cents more than in october

his morale is excellent excellent said paul dejean a 
social worker and close friend of aristide he is going to take a 
few days off now for meditation to decide on what steps to take 
next 
aristide 35 has been the target of at least three assassination 
attempts on sept 11 while he was celebrating mass his st jean 
bosco church was attacked and burned down by armed thugs at least 
12 worshipers were killed and 70 wounded some died trying to shield 
aristide 
in its communique thursday the salesian society accused aristide 
of being a destabilizing influence who instigates violence and 
exalts class warfare 
the most popular priest in haiti the bespectacled charismatic 
aristide is called the prophet by his followers 
in his impassioned and popular sermons aristide never explicitly 
called for armed uprising but he advocates active nonviolence 
as a means for impoverished haitians to achieve social justice 
as a follower of liberation theology aristide also believes the 
church should play an active role in society 
aristide is not a radical he preaches what every priest should 
preach the condemnation of oppression said jeanclaude bajeaux 
director of haitis ecumenical center for human rights 
the expulsion did not change aristides status as a priest and 
he could go to another diocese the rev jacques mesidor aristides 
superior in haiti said the priest might dedicate himself to running 
the charity organization the family is life which he founded 
the decision of the congregation will permit rev aristide to 
have his full liberty he will not be bound by his obedience to a 
religious community mesidor said 
as a seminary student and then as a priest aristide has been 
with the salesians for 20 years the order was founded by st jean 
bosco in turin italy in the 19th century and is chiefly dedicated 
to education 
the salesians ordered aristide to transfer to canada by oct 17 
setting off a wave of demonstrations in haiti aristide never obeyed 
aristide has called for an uprooting of remaining loyalists of 
the former regime of jeanclaude duvalier who fled to exile in 
france in 1986 
the massacre at his church provoked presidential guardsmen to 
overthrow the military regime of lt gen henri namphy on sept 17 
and to replace him with lt gen prosper avril

eight european countries and the european 
economic community told the united nations on friday they have 
ratified a treaty limiting the production of ozonedestroying 
chemicals ensuring that the treaty will go into effect jan 1 
the 1987 treaty calls for signatory nations to reduce 
consumption defined as production plus imports and minus 
exports to 1986 levels by july 1 of next year 
a 20 percent cut must be in place in 1992 and a further 30 
percent cut in 1998 
the chemicals affected are the chlorofluorocarbon or cfc 
compounds practically indestructible refrigeration fluids 
foamblowing agents cleaning solvents and outside north america 
and scandinavia aerosol propellants they have found wide use 
because they are nontoxic and do not burn 
a related set of bromine compounds the halons used for 
firefighting are to be frozen at 1986 levels in 1992 
the july 1 reduction will represent a sizable cut in actual 
usage figures kept by the us international trade commission 
showed a 126 percent increase for 1987 compared with 1986 in 
production of the two most common chemicals in question and most 
observers expect 1988 production to increase again 
these chemicals can last for a century and more in the 
atmosphere rising slowly to the ozone layer 15 to 25 miles high 
where their chlorine atoms are liberated to destroy ozone ozone 
protects the earths surface from the harmful ultraviolet rays of 
the sun 
scientists blame such chlorine for the annual october hole in 
ozone over antarctica which some years sees highaltitude ozone 
fall by 50 percent and a decline in ozone over midlatitudes of up 
to 3 percent since about 1960 
each percent decline in ozone can represent a 4 percent to 6 
percent increase in skin cancer according to the envronmental 
protection agency 
these effects have led epa and many scientists to call for 
revision of the treaty to ban these chemicals altogether and 
several major manufacturers have said they will end all production 
a scientific review called for by the treaty is under way but the 
earliest the signatory nations could consider it under procedures 
now in force is april 1990 
the treaty terms called for it to go into effect when ratified by 
at least 11 countries representing twothirds of world consumption 
although 15 countries with a majority of world consumption had 
ratified before friday they did not make the twothirds mark 
with fridays ratifications its certainly well above 
twothirds said martine coursil of the united nations environment 
program in new york but she did not have the exact share of 
consumption represented by the ratifications 
in addition to the european economic community these countries 
notified the united nations of ratification friday britain 
denmark west germany greece ireland italy the netherlands and 
spain 
according to friends of the earth an environmental group that 
has kept track of ratifications the pact was ratified earlier by 
byelorussian soviet socialist republic canada egypt japan 
kenya luxembourg mexico new zealand nigeria norway portugal 
sweden uganda the ukrainian soviet socialist republic the soviet 
union and the united states 
twentytwo other countries have signed the treaty but not yet 
informed the united nations of ratification the only major 
industrialized country in this group is france 
its a significant achievement and it will be even more 
meaningful once the agreement is strengthened said liz cook of 
friends of the earth

american jewish leaders say the cochairman of 
a soviet committee which generated antiisrael propaganda has told 
them the statesponsored panel will be dismantled by the end of the 
year 
the decision to disband the soviet antizionist committee 
reflects recent improvement in relations between the soviet union 
and israel as well as better treatment of jews wishing to emigrate 
a letter purportedly written by samuel zivs a soviet lawyer who 
was one of the founders of the panel in 1983 was sent to prominent 
jewish leaders in new york a copy of the letter dated nov 14 was 
obtained by the associated press on condition that the people to 
whom it was addressed were not identified 
a soviet embassy spokesman boris malakhov said friday he did 
not know about a decision to disband the committee although i do 
not exclude it is possible 
after saying the panel would be terminated zivs added that he 
was sincerely committed and excited about working with the 
jewish community in the united states and in his own country 
jewish leaders from the united states had urged that the 
committee be disbanded saying it was antisemitic as well as 
antizionist zivs said in the letter that the panels activities 
were never intended to be contrary to how they have unfortunately 
been perceived antisemitic 
the committee composed of jews with close links to the 
government was formed in a bid to dissuade jewish dissidents from 
seeking permits to leave their country for israel and to discredit 
their attempts in the eyes of the west it is headed by david 
dragunsky a retired threestar general 
at a news conference in june 1983 eight committee leaders said 
zionism is a racist ideology akin to the antisemitic dogma 
espoused by nazi leader adolf hitler zionism is an ideology which 
supports israel as a homeland for the jews 
the committee also announced that emigration levels would remain 
at their low ebb because most jews who had wanted to leave had 
already done so the number of exit visas had been dropping 
progressively from an alltime high of 51320 reached in 1979 
hitting a record low of less than 1000 in 1986 
with the advent of a more liberal and open policy instituted by 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev emigration has again risen to 
16572 through november nearly doubling the 1987 figures 
israel and the soviet union this year exchanged consular 
delegations for the first time since the soviets broke ties in 1967

today

edwina currie a controversial deputy health 
minister rated the bestknown politician in britain after prime 
minister margaret thatcher resigned friday in a national crisis 
over a salmonella scare 
mrs currie 42 caused the furor dec 3 when she said most 
british eggs were tainted with salmonella a bacteria that causes 
food poisoning that in rare cases is fatal 
the government launched a 925000 advertising campaign friday to 
try to make britons buy eggs again and announced plans to bail out 
producers by spending millions more to buy unsold eggs piling up at 
farms and warehouses 
earlier friday egg producers filed multimilliondollar damage 
claims against mrs currie 
i think in all the circumstances it resignation is the best 
course mrs currie said in a letter to mrs thatcher after a 
private meeting at the prime ministers 10 downing st residence 
mrs thatcher who provided some defense for mrs currie as the 
uproar over the egg scare built through two weeks said she accepted 
the resignation with great personal sadness 
we shall miss the great energy and enthusiasm you have brought 
to all your work she said in a reply letter 
but it remained uncertain just how risky britains eggs are 
mrs thatcher who in one parliamentary exchange last week 
announced shed had an egg for breakfast reported thursday that 49 
outbreaks of salmonella from eggs had affected 49000 people 
appearing to back mrs currie she acknowledged that many other 
cases probably went unreported 
producers say egg consumption normally 200 million a week or 
four per person has slumped by as much as 60 percent since mrs 
curries warning 
mrs currie was the most headlinegrabbing member of the 
conservative government 
since being elected to parliament five years ago she has become 
noted for downtoearth colorfully phrased advice on health care 
eating habits and life styles 
this year mrs currie advised retirees to mortgage their homes 
to pay for private health care and told the old to don woolly 
nightcaps to ward off winter cold 
a poll in september in the respected weekly economist showed mrs 
curries face was the most instantly recognizable in the government 
after mrs thatchers 
egg producers expressed delight at mrs curries resignation the 
opposition labor party said shed been fired and deserved it but 
added shed be missed 
government ads in national newspapers friday said the incidence 
of salmonella is very small but the advertisements also advised 
against uncooked eggs in homemade mayonnaise and yuletide eggnog 
and it prescribed hardboiled eggs for the sick elderly infants or 
expectant mothers 
this woman with her outrageous statement has caused us 
tremendous damage said john coles managing director of thames 
valley eggs ltd the first producer to institute legal proceedings 
against mrs currie we have lost tens of millions of pounds 
but he said the governments advertising campaign would help in 
no way because it mentions the salmonella risk 
mrs currie born and raised in a workingclass family in the 
northwest england port of liverpool is a rightwing conservative in 
the thatcher mold 
but unlike mrs thatcher she discusses her views frankly on 
everything from politics health and sex to her personal life 
including her two daughters and the refusal of her orthodox jewish 
father ever to see her again after she married a gentile

exactly 215 years after revolutionary patriots 
dumped 342 chests of tea into boston harbor to protest colonial 
tyranny an explorer launched an effort to retrieve them 
barry clifford a salvage entrepreneur who located the first 
pirate ship in the new world four years ago stood on the docks of 
boston harbor in belowfreezing temperatures friday gesturing 
across a channel as divers prepared to jump into the icy waters 
it was a cold night the winds were coming from the northwest 
and the tide was coming in said clifford referring to the 
evening of dec 16 1773 when 30 patriots angered over king george 
iiis threepenny tax on a pound of tea raided three ships and 
dumped the tea overboard 
clifford hopes to bring back about 40 or 50 of the wooden chests 
and place them in a museum with some of the 40 million in artifacts 
he found on the wreck of the pirate ship whydah in 1984 
he is not bothered by criticism that he may be disturbing 
historical sites or the skepticism voiced by museum officials about 
whether the tea chests are still intact after two centuries 
underwater 
weve left this alone for more than 200 years clifford said 
boston harbor is one of the greatest archaeological resources we 
have weve already gotten letters from schoolchildren around the 
country its good when something like this focuses attention on a 
historical event 
though the actual site where the tea was dumped griffins wharf 
now lies 150 yards inland under a boston edison substation clifford 
said he believes tides would have moved the chests into the fort 
point area he said most of the crates were simple wooden boxes 
except for about 50 that were of an ornate chinese design 
using a chartered lobster boat clifford and a crew of five 
motored to the middle of fort point channel an area of the harbor 
located between downtown and south boston 
three divers wearing dry suits and thermal underwear prepared to 
dive 35 feet into the water searching for signs of the crates 
clifford also directed electronic searches of the area using 
sidescan sonar and sidebottom profiling machines 
clifford said he got the idea to look for the tea party chests 
from an unlikely source presidentelect george bush 
i was driving along one day listening to george bush talk about 
the pollution in boston harbor said clifford but it came to me 
all of a sudden how we should go look for the chests no one has 
ever looked at boston harbor before 
fridays search was the first step in what clifford said could be 
a project that takes years though clifford has informal permission 
from state officials to scan areas of the harbor he has been turned 
down in his bid for exclusive rights to survey a nautical square 
mile 
this month the state board of archaelogical resources told 
clifford that he must first retrieve artifacts from the site that 
are at least 100 years old clifford plans to go before the board 
again after locating artifacts and hopes to apply again for a permit 
giving him exclusive rights to search the area 
last week the state supreme court ruled that clifford could keep 
gold silver cannons and other artifacts from the whydah in an 
unanimous opinion the high court rejected the states claim of 
sovereignty over the whydah which foundered off cape cod in april

a reduced supply of tobacco is translating into 
higher prices for farmers this year the agriculture department said 
friday 
the 1988 crop was larger but failed to offset a decline in us 
inventories prior to the new harvest 
tighter supplies and the generally better quality 1988 crop 
have boosted prices of virtually every type of tobacco this 
season the departments economic research service said 
the fluecured crop averaged 161 per pound up 2 cents from 
last year and with larger marketings cash receipts of fluecured 
producers were up about 16 percent the agency said in its latest 
outlook report 
prices were up because of a tighter supplydemand balance a 
better quality crop and higher support prices the report said 
burley sales began nov 21 with prices averaging about 4 cents 
a pound higher than a year earlier the report said burley 
supports were increase 12 cents a pound this season 
us cigarette consumption in calendar 1988 may be down about 2 
percent from last year although total output is larger to meet an

the state department expressed concern friday 
over the very intense pattern of soviet offensive activity in 
afghanistan including air strikes on rebel positions that sometimes 
exceed 100 per day 
but department spokesman charles redman said he does not believe 
the soviet activities which date back about seven weeks mean the 
kremlin will renege on its promise to remove its forces from 
afghanistan by feb 15 
redman said undersecretary of state michael armacost very likely 
raised the issue during a meeting friday with soviet ambassador yuri 
dubinin 
we feel very strongly that this is not what needs to be done in 
afghanistan redman said 
he added that the air strikes violate promises the soviets made 
to washington at the time of the sovietamerican summit meeting a 
year ago 
the soviets contend that withdrawing soviet troops have been 
attacked by afghan rebels and that the united states and pakistan 
have acted in bad faith by continuing the flow of arms and 
ammunition to the rebels

spains 5 percent annual growth rate is the highest in western

us and south korean officials began 
talks friday on the future of us bases here and on revising 
agreements protecting 42000 american troops stationed in south 
korea 
south koreans called for us military facilities to be moved 
from central seoul to rural locations and for a revision of 
regulations exempting american forces from local law 
both sides agreed to continue these kind of discussions on the 
grounds that the reinforcement of the security relationship between 
the two countries is important a south korean statement said 
after the first session 
a us statement said the discussions were held in an 
atmosphere of friendly cooperation and were very useful to both 
sides 
the meeting was organized for south korea to express its concerns 
and us officials to study them no date was set for the next 
meeting 
american officials already have indicated their willingness to 
relocate the sprawling yongsan base if south korea provides 
comparable facilities elsewhere this would help reduce 
antiamerican sentiment among some south koreans and open up prime 
real estate in the capital 
us troops have been based here since 1950 to help defend south 
korea from north korean attack the communist north invaded the 
south in 1950 touching off the korean war 
talks are to center on the status of forces agreement a 1966 
pact some critics want rewritten to give south korea greater 
jurisdiction over us soldiers in criminal and other matters 
dissidents and radical students demand the immediate withdrawal 
of american forces which they contend hamper unification with north 
korea 
but recent surveys show most south koreans support the us 
presence as a deterrent to war on the divided korean peninsula 
in seoul the oppositioncontrolled national assembly narrowly 
approved president roh taewoos nomination of former gen kang 
younghoon as prime minister on friday 
the nomination was approved by 160 of 294 legislators with 
disapproving abstentions from 123 opposition lawmakers 10 no 
votes and one invalid ballot 
more than 70 members of the main opposition party for peace and 
democracy abstained saying roh violated the constitution in naming 
kang as premier this month and appointing 18 new cabinet ministers 
in a major reshuffle 
legal experts say roh needs parliamentary approval first under a 
new constitution adopted in a referendum last year 
the nomination was approved only with the help of former premier 
kim jongpil whose moderate opposition new democratic republican 
party controls 35 seats

a pipe crack found in the cooling system of a 
reactor at the savannah river nuclear weapons plant is a type of 
defect that has cropped up previously and does not represent new 
safety problems a department of energy spokesman said friday 
engineers at the weapons production facility near aiken sc 
have determined that the crack apparently resulted from heat due to 
welding work on the pipe doe spokesman gary pitchford said 
the washington post reported friday that the crack at the plants 
l reactor appeared to be either a flaw or stressinduced defect in 
the stainless steel pipe metal itself 
an official whom the newspaper did not identify said the problem 
was a potential showstopper that could seriously delay 
restarting the three reactors at the savannah river plant and 
possibly require the l reactor to be shut down permanently 
pitchford however said were now highly confident that what 
were seeing here is rather classical cracking intergranular 
stresscorrosion cracking which we have seen rather frequently in 
sensitized metal near where welding has been done 
it is a type of crack that we have seen before and does not in 
our view represent a new phenomenon we do not believe that the 
cracking we have seen represents a major safety concern or a new 
safety problem said the spokesman speaking by telephone from 
does savannah river office 
he added the implication is we need to make improvements and 
changes in our inservice inspection program but it is not a new 
type of cracking or representative of some new safety issue that we 
have not encountered before 
all three reactors at savannah river known as the k l and p 
reactors have been shut down due to maintenance and safety 
concerns 
the reactors are the nations only sources of tritium a 
radioactive isotope of hydrogen used to boost the explosive power of 
nuclear warheads because tritium decays at a rate of 55 percent a 
year it needs to be replenished regularly 
doe is seeking to restart by this summer the k reactor which is 
almost identical in design but older than the l reactor 
pitchford noted that cracks are not infrequently found in areas 
associated with welds its caused by what they call the 
heataffected zone of the metal the metal becomes sensitized in 
the parlance of the metallurgists 
sections of pipe are removed and replaced if a crack is found 
penetrating more than 50 percent of the pipe walls thickness or 
covering more than 20 percent of the pipes circumference 
as part of a regular inspection program pitchford said a 
crack was identified that met those criteria and a section of pipe 
was removed from the l reactor in october 1987 the program called 
for inspection of that pipe after removal that was done in march 
1988 
they found cracks in an unexpected location not associated 
with the original weld which caused the pipe to be removed but 
associated with a structural support welded to the outside of the 
pipe there were a series of cracks on the interior surface of the 
pipe in the heataffected zone where that structural support had 
been welded pitchford said 
the crack at the focus of particular concern was found during 
continued examination of the pipe using ultrasonic testing and 
other methods he said

a federal appeals court friday upheld a 
government decision allowing continued importation of a nuclear 
power plant fuel from south africa despite antiapartheid sanctions 
enacted by congress 
a split threejudge panel of the us circuit court of appeals 
here ruled that the petitioners lacked legal standing to challenge 
the nuclear regulatory commissions decision to allow continued 
importation of uranium hexafluoride from south africa 
the nrcs 1987 decision was challenged by seven members of 
congress four private organizations and two individuals including 
an unemployed uranium miner and an antiapartheid activist 
the petitioners had contended that the nrc failed to enforce the 
antiapartheid sanctions passed by congress in 1986 that forbid 
continued importation of south african uranium and uranium oxide 
the nrc had decided that the sanction law did not ban uranium 
hexafluoride a gas that is used to power nuclear reactors 
circuit judge laurence silberman wrote for the court but judge 
milton pollack filed a concurring opinion to express his uneasiness 
over whether legal standing should be the basis of the ruling 
judge ruth ginsburg who dissented on the standing question and 
pollack said they would uphold the nrc decision on the ground the 
agency properly interpreted the antiapartheid statute as allowing 
continued importation of the radioactive chemical 
ginsburg contended that the antiapartheid activist henry isaacs 
and transafrica inc a group that opposes white minority rule in 
south africa had standing in the case

when frank sinatra wants to get on track with 
thoughts about his boyhood neighborhood in new jersey all he has to 
do is hop a train one of 250 model trains that race through 
favorite neighborhoods including a miniature hoboken 
at christmas when i was a kid id leave hoboken and take a 
fourcent ferry ride and a fivecent train ride and head to the new 
york stores id stand and look at the train displays for three or 
four hours until a saleslady would say please dont touch and 
would you mind moving back a bit ol blue eyes says in this 
weekends edition of usa weekend magazine 
i wanted a train set so badly but i didnt know how my family 
could ever afford it sinatra says one day my mother pawned 
her fox fur piece to buy my first train set a windup engine and an 
oval track i never forgot that 
it was probably the only decent thing she had to wear and i was 
old enough 11 to understand the sacrifice 
so now at his rancho mirage calif home sinatra has an 
18foot by 30foot train station with the 250 model traincars five 
trains can run simultaneously on independent loops running through 
hoboken or an old west town and passing by a new orleans riverboat 
with a billboard announcing a soldout sinatra concert 
theres one locomotive with his initials fas in diamonds a 
crystal replica of the 1925 chattanooga choo choo and two dozen 
18951900 engine replicas the magazine did not include the value of 
the train 
when im just bumming around the house with not much to do 
ill clean the tracks oil the engines change the cars the noise 
of the trains running and whistling can get pretty loud but 
watching the trains just removes my head from thinking about work 
sinatra says 
my electrician loves to get a call about a problem with the 
trains usually after hes found the problem hell say why dont 
we just try the whole set to make absolutely sure everything is ok 
and i say yeah lets turn the whole room on just to be sure

missions abroad because the government is short on cash the cuban 
news agency prensa latina reported friday 
president fidel castro told the central committee of the cuban 
communist party the closings might be needed to direct foreign 
exchange reserves to domestic development the agency said in a 
dispatch received in mexico city 
castro said the 1989 cuban economic program had to be 
elaborated in extremely difficult conditions and is directed at 
solving problems the report said 
it did not say in what countries cuban embassies and consulates 
might be closed 
castro said the economic strategy is designed to prevent 
reductions in what already has been accomplished to maintain levels 
of nutrition and health and to continue working to solve the 
currency deficit that for several years has wounded the economy of 
the island 
under an economic cooperation agreement the soviet union sends 
the dollar proceeds of its oil export sales to cuba the dollars 
depreciation in international currency markets has hit cubas 
foreign exchange reserves 
citing a dollar shortage cuba asked western creditor nations 
this year to reschedule its estimated 55 billion foreign debt over 
15 years and ask for a fiveyear grace period according to a 
central bank document released in march 
the request reportedly was turned down according to manuel 
sanchez perez a former deputy trade minister who defected in 1985

us and soviet negotiators have reached 
virtual agreement on ways to measure some underground nuclear tests 
but a final agreement still eludes the two sides the state 
department said friday 
the result is further postponement of possible senate 
ratification of two nuclear test treaties completed more than a 
decade ago the treaties would limit underground blasts to 150 
kilotons 
president reagan has said he would submit the 1974 accord on 
weapons tests and the 1976 agreement on tests for civilian purposes 
only if agreement were reached on airtight procedures to guard 
against cheating 
reagan has accused the soviets of carrying out tests that 
probably exceeded the permissible ceiling some american experts 
doubted the soviets had violated the treaties which both sides are 
supposed to be obseving even though the senate has not approved the 
pacts 
other experts said the problem was a lack of reliable ways to 
measure underground blasts the only kind still legal and it was 
difficult to tell whether the soviets were in compliance 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev meanwhile suspended all 
soviets tests in august 1985 and invited the united states to join 
the moratorium the reagan administration rejected the proposal 
administration officials said it was necessary to conduct us tests 
in nevada to improve american nuclear weapons and the soviets 
resumed testing in february 1987 
the latest round of talks which adjourned thursday in geneva 
after four months was termed a success by charles e redman the 
state department spokesman 
he said work on the 1976 civilian test ban treaty has been 
substantially finished but redman said further work was required 
on the 1974 accord which is far more important since it deals with 
weapons development 
the main problem he said is that the soviets want to place 
restrictions on the american system of measurement known as cortex 
which is being used under the 1976 treaty some american experts 
consider the method of using cables dropped into a footwide hole 
parallel to the test shaft more reliable than remote seismic 
measurements 
the two sides did not set a date for resuming the negotiations 
that is a decision to be taken by the bush administration 
last july americans and soviets carried out a joint experiment 
at the us test site in nevada on verification procedures a second 
joint experiment was held in semipalatinsk in september

a congressional study says the air force is 
running two years late and well above cost estimates with a 
problemplagued project to replace a vital computer link in the air 
defense system for north america 
the latest projected pricetag for the new computer system for the 
north american aerospace defense command is 281 million according 
to the general accounting office the investigative agency for 
congress 
that figure is 39 million above what the air force in april 1987 
estimated it would cost to replace the aging computers that are 
supposed to provide us and canadian leaders with vital information 
in case of an air attack 
when the new system for the colorado installation was proposed in 
1981 the air force estimated it would cost 202 million gao said 
in a report to the house appropriations defense subcommittee 
the study said the new system being developed by general 
telephone and electronics inc is not expected to be operational 
until september 1991 two years later than planned 
according to gao a number of problems have been encountered with 
the first phase of the project a semiautomated control unit that 
monitors communication lines and switches to backup lines and 
equipment when communication quality deteriorates 
the problems include unreliable computer software that would 
cause a loss of communications if the software failed to perform 
properly in an emergency 
a failure of this nature during actual operations could 
seriously affect the air forces ability to satisfy mission 
requirements during a crisis gao said 
the defense department told gao that the software problem has 
been isolated and will be fixed by gte 
the department said the contractor is also fixing another problem 
cited by gao during a test it took 31 minutes to restart the unit 
after a power failure 29 minutes longer than specified by the 
contract 
gao said the air force will have to spend 5 million rewiring 
norads cheyenne mountain communications center because the wiring 
on the new gear is not compatible with wiring on some and perhaps 
all existing electronics equipment in the center 
the defense department said that gte followed the circuit 
interface standards specified by the air force

solidarity chairman lech walesa on friday 
led 3000 people in honoring baltic seacoast workers killed in 1970 
riots and said he is beginning to see signs of a new opportunity 
for poland 
something is becoming visible in this country i dont know 
what it is maybe we will fail once more walesa told a rally at 
the lenin shipyard 
but when there is a chance even a minimal chance we must 
undertake it because it is a chance for poland for all of us and 
especially for youth 
we cannot waste it 
walesa seemed to be referring to the communist governments 
growing tolerance for solidarity the soviet blocs first 
independent union movement which was crushed under martial law in 
1981 
the official media have increased noncritical coverage of walesa 
and the government has made overtures to him to begin a dialogue 
walesa walked at the head of a procession of work crews from 
inside the shipyard to the monument to the slain workers outside its 
gates 
as the crowd pressed around him he gently laid a wreath of red 
and white carnations and led the singing of two patriotic hymns 
including the national anthem 
the ceremony under gray skies marked the 18th anniversary of 
the riots for freedom and bread security forces shot down 
dozens of coast workers including at least 27 in gdansk the exact 
number of victims was never revealed 
also on this date in 1981 riot police stormed the wujek mine in 
katowice and killed nine miners during the imposition of martial law 
officially outlawed solidarity also sponsored peaceful rallies 
outside the lenin steel mill in nowa huta near krakow and in 
katowice in southern poland 
walesa attended a memorial mass on friday evening in gdansk 
later hundreds of riot police shepherded the worshipers to a train 
station a few blocks away the crowd sang only religious songs 
punctuated by a few chants of solidarity 
departing from past practice statecontrolled radio and 
television friday covered the solidarity wreathlaying in addition 
to the official ceremonies 
one of the most tragic dates in the history of the nation a 
tv commentator said 
the 1970 killings were a seminal event in the development of the 
modern opposition movement in poland workers began rioting when the 
government announced drastic food price increases just before 
christmas 
the brutal repression of the protests created an outcry that 
ended the 14year national leadership of wladyslaw gomulka and 
radicalized a generation of young workers including walesa 
walesa led the next gdansk workers revolt of 1980 that resulted

president carlos salinas de gortari has asked 
congress for approval to seek 6 billion in foreign credits next 
year as a means of reviving the economy 
salinas sworn in dec 1 said the 6 billion would cover a 
projected 5 billion balance of payments deficit next year and 
provide money for development 
in a message with the 1989 budget sent to the chamber of deputies 
late thursday he said the deficit would stem from dynamism in 
imports associated with the economic recovery and conservative 
petroleum export income 
it is my conviction that the construction of the economic 
future must be the prerogative and responsibility of all 
society he said 
reductions in trade barriers have caused a 50 percent increase in 
imports this year from 1987 weak demand and low prices on the world 
oil market have cost mexico at least 2 billion in anticipated 1988 
export revenue 
the salinas budget forecasts a positive though moderate 15 
percent growth rate next year up from 04 percent this year it 
said the economy grew 14 percent in 1986 
under a wageprice freeze begun in march mexicos 1988 inflation 
rate is expected to be 51 percent the document said 
inflation for the first 11 months was just over 48 percent after 
a record 1592 percent in 1987 the central bank has reported 
for 1989 inflation is expected to be 22 percent or lower 
according to the budget earlier this week the president announced 
an extension of freeze through june 1989 
among his 1989 policy goals salinas included 
achieving price stability 
protecting the jobs and purchasing power of workers 
increasing business and labor support for his antiinflation 
program and his proposals for negotiating better terms on the 102 
billion foreign debt 
forthcoming talks with foreign creditors dominated salinas 
message to congress he promised a firm stand with creditor 
banks and dwelt on what the debt has cost the mexican economy 
salinas said the national product has been checked investment 
has abated real salaries have been reduced and the creation of jobs 
has been insufficient to give the opportunity of wellpaid work 
the priority is growth the net transfer of resources will have to 
be reduced substantially 
the president contends mexico no longer can afford to spend 5 
percent of its gross national product on debt service about 14 
billion in interest and principal this year 
on tuesday treasury secretary pedro aspe said the government 
wants to reduce the debtservice figure to 3 percent

people in cities shattered by the dec 7 
earthquake flung themselves before bulldozers to keep workers from 
clearing rubble until bodies of relatives were found the soviet 
premier said friday 
tanks and armored personnel carriers sealed off spitak one of 
the devastated armenian cities at least 10 bulldozers cleared 
debris and trucks hauled it away said morten horvaal an associated 
press photographer who drove past spitak twice on friday 
the head of the communist party in spitak 46 miles northwest of 
yerevan told the ap thursday that demolition would begin sunday 
premier nikolai i ryzhkov did not give details of the disruption 
by residents mentioned during a televised report of a meeting of 
the politburo commission overseeing rescue and relief opwerations 
he said one more survivor was pulled from the ruins thursday in 
spitak where the quake killed about 15000 of the 25000 residents 
officials estimate the overall death toll at 55000 
the head of the soviet red cross said soviet doctors can handle 
the treatment of earthquake victims and do not need international 
help 
several foreign doctors complained privately that soviet 
colleagues would not let them treat patients with the millions of 
dollars worth of sophisticated medical equipment brought in 
especially for the disaster 
dr dmitri venidiktov chairman of the soviet red cross and 
former deputy health minister said at a news conference in yerevan 
capital of the armenian republic about foreign help if we talk 
about doctors and nurses i can say thank you very much but its no 
longer necessary 
he said medical teams had arrived from throughout the soviet 
union and we can accept individuals from abroad to show them 
what has been done but we dont need medical assistance in the 
direct sense 
ryzhkov praised foreign volunteers and said the foreign ministry 
had not given them enough assistance 
they helped in a big way the premier said even though you 
cant even find translators here 
some foreign doctors said they were leaving earlier than planned 
but others were on the way to the stricken region 
thirtyfive israeli doctors and health care workers had been 
expected friday but fog at the small yerevan airport prevented 
their arrival more than 100 international flights have landed at 
yerevan since the quake 
george reid spokesman for the international league of red cross 
and red crescent societies said 22312 bodies were recovered by 
friday an increase of 537 from the previous day reid said the 
projected death toll was 45000 
soviet officials say the quake claimed 55000 lives and left 
500000 of the 700000 people in the area homeless 
dr robert gale an american who helped the soviets during the 
chernobyl nuclear disaster more than two years ago told the 
associated press he believed 100000 people had been killed based 
on personal observation 
reid said 5079 injured remained hospitalized and 4440 had been 
discharged the red cross is feeding 500000 people in ethiopia 
and we had years to prepare he said thats about the number 
affected here in 20 seconds 
the red cross is bringing in 5000 winter tents like those used 
by the norwegian army and soviet authorities are hoping to bring in 
thousands of yurts modern versions of mongol tents by rail he 
said 
soviet officials also hope to bring in mobile homes reid said 
adding that 5000 are needed in spitak alone to shelter local men 
who will work on rebuilding the town 
eduard aikazyan the armenian government representative in 
moscow said the rebuilding of ruined cities and towns would not 
begin until rescue efforts were finished but he did not say when 
that would be 
he said each survivor would be given 500 rubles and families 
would get 2000 rubles in addition to the individual allowances 
aikazyan said evacuation of women and children to sanatoriums and 
vacation resorts would continue 
one can imagine the mental condition of many people who 
witnessed the catastrophe he said they need rest 
those who want to remain near their homes will be allowed to do 
so he said and commented there are people who prefer to live 
even in ruins

a new immigration policy to sort out and 
deport immigrants filing unfounded political asylum claims before 
they travel farther into the united states began friday in the 
southern tip of texas 
the brownsville area is the main entry for central americans who 
cross the border illegally and claim political asylum and the new 
policy is expected to concentrate more displaced wouldbe immigrants 
in the lower rio grande valley 
it requires the 2000 asylum applicants each week present their 
cases in the area instead of waiting to apply until they reach 
their final destinations brownsville is about 30 miles south of 
harlingen 
very few of the immigrants intend to stay in impoverished 
southern texas where unemployment ranges from 12 percent to 50 
percent and many people live in rural slums that lack running water 
to deal with the workload from the new policy the immigration 
and naturalization service sent six additional adjudicators to 
harlingen to work 10 hours a day six days a week interviewing 
applicants it will send 20 more after jan 1 officials said 
the procedure applies to all nationalities but was designed to 
relieve the backlog of asylum applicants in places such as los 
angeles with 30000 pending cases and miami with a backlog of 
50000 said rick kenney an ins spokesman in washington 
similar procedures have taken effect in those two cities which 
are also congregating points 
in the lower rio grande valley refugee shelters have been filled 
to capacity for months many immigrants end up sleeping outdoors or 
in dilapidated immigrant motels 
ins harlingen district director jerry sewell said he hopes fewer 
people will come once word reaches central america that the agency 
is cracking down on asylum 
the ins turned people away friday in harlingen after limiting the 
number of asylum applicants to 200 for the day the ins has promised 
to provide decisions on the cases within 30 days and applicants 
were instructed to return jan 16 
files will be sent to washington for advisory opinions on each 
case 
ins officials said travel outside the area probably will be too 
expensive for most applicants who must return for their decisions 
or face deportation those denied asylum will be asked to leave the 
country within 30 days but may appeal through an immigration court 
ins officials maintain that most applicants are ineligible for 
asylum because they merely want to better themselves economically 
asylum generally is granted for political reasons 
previously when applicants applied at their destination cities 
some would wait more than a year for a decision because of the 
backlog cases taking longer than 60 days require the ins to provide 
work authorization which many received those in the faster process 
in harlingen however will not be allowed to work officials said 
in san francisco a federal judge issued a ruling this week that 
could affect the new ins policy if it is extended to other 
jurisdictions us district judge charles legge ruled that work 
permits must be given to aliens throughout their appeal of an asylum 
decision a process that can take several years 
legge ordered the ins to provide work permits to a group of farm 
workers from central america during the period in which their 
applications for asylum have been denied and a deportation hearing 
has not yet been scheduled 
refugee advocates contend that keeping the immigrants in southern 
texas while they await asylum decisions will only increase the 
misery and concentration of central americans in the area 
i think the people are going to be more visible said ninfa 
krueger with the border association for refugees from central 
america which provides legal advocacy and social services 
theres a concern already that we dont have the means to take 
care of them 
the policy is meant to scare people enough to make them stop 
coming but i think theyre more scared of the war and theyll keep 
coming ms krueger said 
antonio a 27yearold nicaraguan who illegally crossed the rio 
grande on inner tubes tuesday with a group of 25 immigrants waited 
outside the ins office friday 
i dont know where im going to go he said while looking for 
someone who understood enough english to help him fill out his 
application 
antonio who asked that his last name not be used in order to 
protect his family in managua said he has a relative in miami his 
intended destination where he could stay 
but i dont have the money to travel there and then come back 
here he said in spanish theres no place to go 
i think at first we may see a slightly higher number of aliens 
in the area but that will soon taper off as soon as word gets back 
to central america that harlingen is no longer providing a free 
ride said virginia kice an ins spokeswoman in harlingen

the czechoslovak communist party 
appointed a top economic official to replace a veteran party 
hardliner as head of a commission on foreign affairs a party 
spokesman said friday 
the appointment of jozef lenart 65 indicates the leadership 
wants to focus greater attention on boosting foreign economic 
cooperation 
lenart replaces vasil bilak 71 who resigned all his political 
posts thursday citing his 20year service as a central committee 
secretary and member of the ruling politburo 
spokesman vladimir patek made the announcement to journalists at 
the end of a twoday party central committee meeting 
he said miroslav valek also resigned as slovak culture minister 
at his own request but remained a member of the central committee 
valek last month called on the countrys leadership to correct 
mistakes made since the prague spring reforms of 1968 were 
crushed by sovietled troops 
lenart is a central committee secretary in charge of the economy 
and heads the partys commission for the national economy 
he served as premier from 1963 to 1968 when the country began 
implementing economic reforms leading up to the prague spring 
reforms of thencommunist leader alexander dubcek 
patek told journalists the personnel changes were nothing but a

former ohio rep jim stanton is being backed by 
former house speaker thomas p oneill of massachusetts and ohio 
sens john glenn and howard metzenbaum to be the democratic partys 
next national chairman a metzenbaum spokeswoman said friday 
oneill glenn metzenbaum and ohio reps mary rose oakar and 
louis stokes signed a mailgram urging labor leaders nationwide to 
throw their support behind stanton said nancy coffey metzenbaums 
press secretary 
stanton has not been in the public eye since his 1976 loss to 
metzenbaum in the democratic senate primary in ohio but he recently 
moved to washington and started laying plans for a return to 
political life 
the mailgram praises stanton as a friend of the labor movement 
for many many years 
for all practical purposes the democratic partys race to the 
presidency in 1992 has already begun it said our first step 
must be to unite behind a leader who can reach out and appeal to 
every corner of our diverse party we believe jim stanton is such a 
leader and the support of labor is crucial to his candidacy

policymakers at the federal reserve fearing 
that a moderation in the growth rate of the economy might have been 
temporary decided at their november meeting to tilt toward higher 
interest rates according to minutes of that session released friday 
the federal open market committee which establishes monetary 
policy for the central bank voted 111 on nov 1 to leave policy 
unchanged for the time being 
but in a directive to the federal reserve bank of new york the 
committee said somewhat greater reserve restraint might be 
acceptable depending on inflation and the strength of the economy 
and called for remaining especially alert to potential 
developments that might require some firming of monetary policy 
the new york bank buys and sells government securities owned by 
banks to drain or swell the amount of reserves the banks have to 
make loans and thus influence the price or interest rate on those 
loans 
the fed whose main job is to guard against inflation is seeking 
to slow the growth of the economy as measured by the gross national 
product from the 3 percent to 35 percent range to a level it 
consider sustainable without inflation between 2 percent to 25 
percent 
in late march it began a series of credit tightening moves 
culminating in august with a onehalf percentage point increase to 
65 percent in its discount rate the interest it charges to make 
bank loans 
economic statistics for august and september led some economists 
to conclude that the policy was succeeding in dampening the economy 
but figures for october and november show a rebound unemployment is 
near a 14year low and factories are using more of their capacity 
than at any time in nine years a development economists say could 
lead to shortages and price increases 
market participants say it became clear this week that the fed 
decided to begin nudging interest rates higher again the federal 
funds rate the rate at which banks make overnight loans among 
themselves rose from about 84 percent on tuesday to 89 percent 
friday 
consumer rates have responded by also heading higher fixedrate 
mortgages not including special addon fees known as points 
averaged 1071 percent this week matching the high for the year 
oneyear adjustablerate mortgages at 843 percent were the 
highest in 14 months 
in november the minutes said a majority of the fed 
committee members believed that operations should be adjusted more 
readily toward further tightening than toward any easing although 
some of the members going along with the directive were less 
inclined than they had been previously to bias it toward further 
restraint 
fed gov martha seger who cast the only dissenting vote said 
unchanged policy was acceptable to her but she did not want to 
bias the directive toward potential tightening the minutes said 
in her view they said current indications of slower 
economic growth pointed to reduced inflationary pressures 
over the year ahead 
the open market committee met again this week to discuss monetary 
policy the minutes of that meeting wont be released until after 
the next meeting on feb 78 the committee is composed of the 
sevenmember federal reserve board and five of the 12 presidents of 
the feds district banks

postmaster general anthony m frank announced 
friday that the postal service and dallas billionaire h ross 
perots company perot systems corp have agreed to drop their 
embattled 500000 nobid contract to study costsavings measures 
despite an excellent effort by perot systems the contract has 
been tied up so badly by protests and lawsuits that we have lost 
much of the original opportunity and even more delays are likely 
due to still active lawsuits between perot and general motors 
frank said in a statement 
perot and his former company electronic data systems are locked 
in state and federal lawsuits over whether he is violating a 
covenant with eds not to compete against the company until december 
1989 the agreement stems from his bitter break with general motors 
corp two years after selling the automaker the dataprocessing 
company he founded in 1962 
under the may 27 contract with the postal service perot systems 
a computer services firm was to identify cost savings and then 
implement the proposed changes in return for a share of the savings 
challenges to the postal services authority to issue the contract 
were filed in june and work was suspended july 8 
eds and lawmakers had complained that the postal service contract 
unfairly favored perot the contract was the first for perot systems 
the general services administration then canceled the contract 
but the us circuit court of appeals in washington overturned that 
ruling franks suspension of the deal however remained in effect 
until his agreement friday with perot to drop it completely 
perot systems said in a statement that it wished the postal 
service well and sincerely hope that they will have the 
opportunity to implement the changes that they know must be made 
it was a bad contract to begin with said eds spokesman roger 
still todays action is in the best interest of the competitive 
process our objective all along was to get it in the competitive 
process as opposed to the sweetheart deal that it was 
frank said the postal service had negotiated what it hoped would 
be an exceptionally productive agreement 
however we have reached the point where we no longer enjoy the 
same advantage frank said the interests of competing 
companies and the concerns of general motors about mr perots 
severance agreement have led to protests and lawsuits which have 
forced suspension of all work under the contract 
frank said the studies the service had hoped to complete last 
august cannot now be done before february and could well be 
further delayed by active litigation 
under an injunction stemming from a lawsuit filed by eds in 
fairfax county va perot is prohibited from performing work on any 
contract or seeking any new contract which could be profitable to 
his new firm 
this has effectively prohibited perot systems from resuming 
work under the original postal service agreement the service said 
in a statement

he was charged with taking hostages at a newspaper was released from 
jail friday following his arrest this week stemming from a car chase 
with police 
timothy jacobs was freed after the national council of churches 
posted his 25000 bail and the onondaga indian nation on whose 
reservation he had sought refuge provided a sworn statement that it 
would not harbor him should gov mario cuomo order his extradition

participation 
it was at night and nobody would come out mrs scales said 
i cant blame them for not coming out at night but we havent had 
a meeting because they dont come out

the fernald uraniumprocessing plant repeatedly 
contaminated its environs with radioactive materials and violated 
pollution laws in three decades of operation its neighbors told a 
federal judge friday 
the neighbors are suing the department of energy plants former 
operators national lead of ohio inc and its parent company 
national lead industries in a 300 million class action 
their chief lawyer stanley chesley on friday asked us 
district judge s arthur spiegel to issue a summary judgment in 
favor of the plaintiffs an energy department lawyer representing 
national lead argued that a summary judgment a judges ruling 
based on the evidence already presented without further proceedings 
should be issued in favor of the company 
westinghouse materials co of ohio took over operation of the 
37yearold plant from national lead the facilitys only previous 
operator on jan 1 1986 
the plant dumped radioactive radium and uranium daily into the 
great miami river which flows by the 1050acre site often 
exceeding its stated desire to limit the uranium dumping to 36 
pounds daily in the 1950s said chesley and his assistant louise 
roselle 
the great miami aquifer an underground regional water extending 
southward from dayton to hamilton ohio flows under the plant and 
there is evidence of radioactive ground water contamination at the 
plant site chesley said 
the plaintiffs attorneys also said they have evidence to show 
that the plant has subjected residents to excessive daily doses of 
radiation and has failed to qualify for federal clean air act 
operating permits since 1984 
chesley told the court he has documents indicating that the 
government apparently lied when it told residents in the past that 
the plant was not contaminating the environment 
but energy department lawyer marc johnston said the department 
found that national lead did not violate its contract with the 
government in running the plant that is critical he argued 
because congress exempted energy department facilities from the laws 
that the neighbors cite and instead left it up to the energy 
department to regulate its own facilities 
we do not dispute that there were emissions of various 
materials from that plant including uranium johnston said we 
do deny that there were hazardous conditions created 
the energy department admitted in 1985 that the plant had 
released an estimated 300000 pounds of uranium oxide dust into the 
atmosphere through faulty exhaustair filter systems during three 
decades of operations 
the energy department is representing national lead of ohio and 
its parent because they ultimately were told by the government how 
to operate the plant johnston said the government is not a 
defendant in the lawsuit 
johnston also said he was challenging spiegels previous decision 
to grant classaction status to the lawsuit 
he argued that national lead cannot be found liable because it 
was following the governments orders to run the plant and an 
energy department contract enforcement officer concluded that the 
company had carried out its responsibilities 
chesley introduced in court a january 1985 letter by joe lagrone 
an energy department manager who oversees the plant from oak ridge 
tenn to national lead industries of hightstown nj 
lagrone said in the letter that he found national lead of ohios 
performance unsatisfactory in production operations health safety 
and fire requirements environmental management and budget 
administration 
the energy department penalized the company by subtracting more 
than 1 million from its contract payments chesley said it 
certainly belies that this company was in compliance chesley said 
of the letter 
the judge ended the court session by saying he was taking the 
case under review and would try to issue his ruling soon 
because of spiegels previous decision to certify the lawsuit as 
a classaction it represents 14000 people living within five miles 
of the plant formally known as the feed materials production 
center which has operated since 1951 and processes uranium for the 
governments production elsewhere of nuclear weapons 
production at the plant has been halted since oct 7 because of a 
strike by workers who are to vote saturday on a tentative contract 
the neighbors allege the plant contaminated the environs 18 miles 
northwest of cincinnati polluting air water and land and 
subjecting neighbors to excessive radiation exposure they say they 
are due damages for emotional distress exposurecaused health 
impairments and reduced property values caused by the plants 
proximity 
chesley cited a series of presidential executive orders since 
1948 that he said required federal agencies to work with state and 
local agencies to avoid pollution and to comply with environmental 
laws unless the president grants specific exemptions because of 
national security no president has granted any such exemption for 
the fernald plant he said 
the state of ohio on dec 2 reached a courtapproved settlement 
with the energy department granting the state environmental 
supervision of hazardous wastes at the plant ohio officials said 
the agreement will allow the state to police the federal cleanup of 
the site 
but chesley said the agreement does not commit the federal 
government to the cleanup and does not give ohio regulatory power 
over radioactive wastes stored at the plant radioactive wastes are 
regulated separately from hazardous materials

markus misha wolf the famed 
east german spymaster who resigned unexpectedly last year denounced 
stalinism in his first interview with a western author the author 
said friday 
wolf 65 was not asked about his espionage activity for the 
communist state in the interview author henning mueller said 
but he said the former intelligence chief whose agents activity 
triggered the fall of west german chancellor willy brandt in 1974 
talked at length about the terror of soviet dictator josef stalins 
rule 
mueller used the interview as material for a book on wolfs 
father friedrich a wellknown jewish doctor and dramatist he said 
he conducted the interview earlier year in east berlin after 
applying to east germanys academy of arts for permission 
it went without any problems i applied to the academy and 
received permission mueller said in a telephone interview i 
believe this is the first and only interview wolf gave to a western 
author 
mueller said wolf talked at length about his familys stay in the 
soviet union during stalins rule and made strong statements against 
him 
excerpts of the interview were published friday by the 
frankfurter rundschau a leftleaning newspaper and their contents 
were confirmed by mueller 
in the brief excerpts wolf spoke of his family and experiences 
of sorrow and repression under stalins dictatorship in the soviet 
union 
our parents were deeply moved by the fate of many friends and 
acquaintances that were hit by stalins repressions wolf was 
quoted as saying 
despotism and injustice dont really go together well with the 
ideals of the october revolution he was quoted as saying 
the newspaper said similar antistalin statements made by wolf in 
a documentary film for east german television apparently led 
authorities to put the film into archives without ever showing it 
the film is about wolfs family 
east germany recently banned the distribution of a soviet 
magazine which has been publishing frank accounts of stalins terror 
the communist state has resisted following economic and political 
reforms started by soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
wolfs father was a communist and fled with his wife and two sons 
from nazi germany the family first went to switzerland and france 
and in 1934 settled in the soviet union 
markus wolf born in 1923 near stuttgart lived in the soviet 
union until 1945 when he returned to the sovietoccupied zone of 
defeated germany 
for six years he worked as a diplomat and journalist then 
entered east germanys intelligence organization in 1951 and became 
its director in 1958 
he built up a formidable network of agents focusing primarily on 
west germany 
for decades wolf was known to western intelligence agencies only 
as the man without a face his last known photograph dated back 
to 1959 until a western intelligence agent took another shot in 
1982 when wolf attended the funeral of his brother konrad 
wolf gained notoriety in the west after the 1974 exposure of 
guenther guillaume a senior adviser to thenwest german chancellor 
brandt as an east german spy the arrest of guillaume wolfs top 
agent led to brandts resignation 
wolfs retirement in february 1987 took west german government 
and security officials by surprise the official east german news 
agency adn said wolf was leaving office at his own wish

us ambassador robert h pelletreau jr 
opened historic talks with the plo on friday and both sides said 
they hoped the dialogue would lead to a comprehensive middle east 
peace 
the meeting coming just two days after washington reversed a 
longstanding policy of refusing to deal with the palestine 
liberation organization inspired hope in many quarters that the 
middle east peace process soon will become more than just an empty 
phrase 
our discussions were very practical and characterized i would 
say by seriousness of purpose pelletreau told reporters after 
the 90minute meeting with a fourman plo delegation led by yasser 
abdrabbou a member of the groups executive committee 
the ambassador implied there would be other meetings but did not 
say when abdrabbou said the next session probably would come in 
the next few weeks 
it is our hope that this dialogue as it develops will help 
bring about direct negotiations that will lead to comprehensive 
peace said pelletreau who was accompanied to the talks by edmund 
hull political counselor at the us embassy in tunis 
each side made separate statements to reporters after the meeting 
at dar maghrebia an official tunisian government guest residence in 
carthage a suburb just north of tunis neither side gave 
substantive details of the talks 
we hope the application of this change in the policy of the 
united states will be practiced through a real pressure on israel in 
order to change the policy of occupation the policy of terrorism 
the policy of oppression against our palestinian people said 
abdrabbou 
us officials have emphasized the new contacts are merely a 
dialogue and do not represent real peace negotiations the plo 
says it does not see the distinction 
we dont see any difference between dialogue and talks and 
negotiations said abdrabbou a member of the marxist democratic 
front for the liberation of palestine and director of the plos 
information deparment in washington state department spokesman 
charles e redman declined to comment on abdrabbous statement 
redman said he did not know when the next meeting would be held 
abdrabbou said the palestinian delegation represented the plo 
executive committee which in turn was assuming the role of the 
provisional government of palestine 
last month the palestine national council the plos parliament 
in exile proclaimed an independent palestinian state the borders 
were not specified 
after a news conference by plo chief yasser arafat on wednesday 
the united states announced that the organization had met conditions 
for the start of a dialogue by clearly recognizing israel and 
renouncing terrorism 
secretary of state george p shultz designated pelletreau 53 as 
washingtons only authorized channel for dealing with the plo 
apparently hoping to avoid backdoor contacts 
western diplomatic sources speaking on condition that they not 
be identified further said the first priority of the us side 
would be making clear washingtons attitude on terrorism 
the sources said that while the united states was aware the plo 
could not be held responsible for all acts of terrorism it would 
expect the group to dissassociate itself clearly from any future 
terrorist attack 
the second us priority the sources added was a general 
explanation of washingtons position on middle east peace 
substantive talks the sources said most likely would have to 
wait until presidentelect george bush takes over next month 
the plo delegation to the talks included abdrabbou hakim 
balawi the plos permanent representative to tunisia and a member 
of arafats fatah guerrilla group the largest of the nine groups 
under the plo umbrella 
also in the delegation were abdullah hourani an independent 
member of the plo executive committee and abdellatif abu hajlah a 
fatah member and directorgeneral of the plo political department 
the delegations conducted their talks across two tables placed 
facetoface under a huge crystal chandelier in a large blue room of 
the guest house on a marbletop table off to one side stood small 
us and palestinian flags 
abdrabbou credited the yearold uprising in the israelioccupied 
west bank and gaza strip for the present talks 
we are here in the name of the intefadeh uprising he said 
we will continue our efforts to achieve the goals of the 
intefadeh more than 320 palestinians and 13 israelis have been 
killed in the uprising

a federal appeals court 
friday said a temporary injunction blocking a justice department 
random drug testing program should not extend to presidential 
appointees in the justice department or to employees there whose job 
is to handle drugs 
a twoparagraph order from the us circuit court of appeals 
noted that none of the justice department lawyers challenging the 
drugtesting program is a presidential appointee or someone who 
maintains stores or safeguards drugs as part of their work 
therefore said the order the lawyers challenging the program 
lack standing to include those two categories of justice 
department personnel 
the order affects only a small number of the 4700 justice 
department empoyees who would be included in a mandatory random 
drugtesting program fewer than 20 presidential appointees and a 
somewhat larger number in the other category 
the drug testing program had not been put in effect when it was 
challenged last summer 
a justice department spokeswoman amy brown said the practical 
impact of the order seems to be that testing could proceed for 
those two small categories of employees if the department decided to 
issue 30day notices informing those two groups that they could face 
testing after one month 
the appeals court remanded the case to us district court to 
excise those two categories from the preliminary injunction and 
return the case to the appeals court for further consideration 
us district judge george revercomb found that testing without 
any suspicion of drug use by the individual is an unconstitutional 
invasion of privacy

a federal appeals court that twice 
blocked the death of double murderer gerald smith refused friday to 
stop smiths latest scheduled execution set for 1201 am tuesday 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals in st louis ruled 73 to 
deny a petition filed by smiths wife that sought to reopen the case 
lynn smiths request cited a recent newspaper article that raised 
doubts about smiths guilt 
the court rejected the request without comment 
the ruling apparently leaves it to the us supreme court or to 
smith to stop the execution which would be the first in missouri 
since 1965 
smith has ordered appeals dropped and on friday prison officials 
said he appeared committed to carrying through with it 
smith 30 is sentenced to die for two unrelated murders he 
faces death warrants for the 1980 murder of karen roberts and the 
1985 stabbing death of fellow death row inmate robert baker

gunmen on friday kidnapped three irish 
soldiers serving with the un peacekeeping force in south lebanon 
and demanded the release of a guerrilla leader abducted by israel 
police said 
in other developments friday 
peter winkler a swiss official of the international committee 
of the red cross who was kidnapped on nov 17 was released in the 
southern city of sidon he said he did not know who kidnapped him 
voice of lebanon radio said winkler was released by the 
fatahrevolutionary council the guerrilla group headed by 
palestinian terrorist abu nidal 
police said eight fighters were killed and four wounded in sidon 
when the mainstream shiite moslem amal militia fought guerrillas of 
the palestine liberation organization 
fridays abduction was the second time in less than 24 hours that 
lebanese gunmen captured irish troops to retaliate for israels 
seizure of jawad kasfi 
in jerusalem the israeli army said its soldiers in south lebanon 
seized kasfi another senior local guerrilla commander and two other 
guerrilla suspects in the village of tibnin on thursday 
police said four gunmen in two cars seized the three irish 
soldiers in tibnin on friday bundled them into a white mercedes and 
sped away the village borders on israels selfproclaimed security 
zone 
lebanese police said on condition of anonymity that the 
kidnappers demanded that the un interim force in lebanon with 
which the three irish soldiers served negotiate with israel for the 
release of the four guerrilla suspects 
unifil spokesman timur goksel said the un force has not 
negotiated with israel so far 
they israel acknowledged that they are holding these people 
this was our only official contact goksel said of course 
there was a very strong protest from unifil because it was an 
infringement on unifil zone but we got no response to that 
the israeli army identified kasfi as a leader of the religious 
resistance front headed by mustafa dirani a splinter faction of 
amal 
the faction is affiliated with the iranianbacked hezbollah or 
party of god a fundamentalist movement at odds with amal 
the military command said kasfi was suspected of organizing and 
participating in kidnappings and dozens of attacks against israeli 
army forces and the allied south lebanon army militia since 1984 
the suspects are undergoing interrogation the army said in a 
statement those found innocent of attacks will be released 
kasfi was abducted by two israeli soldiers and three south 
lebanon army men who drove into tibnin in civilian cars lebanese 
police said a spokesman made no mention of other captives 
goksel said un peacekeeping troops backed by amal militiamen 
would keep searching in the area until the missing men are found 
tibnin is 15 miles north of the israeli border in the un 
forces zone of operations 
the zone patrolled by the ninenation un force overlaps the 
israeli security belt which is six to 10 miles deep and runs from 
the mediterranean to the foothills of mount hermon it is designed 
to curb crossborder guerrilla raids 
un troops blocked all roads in its area of operations in 
an effort to prevent the gunmen from smuggling the three irish 
soldiers out of south lebanon a police spokesman said 
amal which regularly cooperates with the un force 
threatened to crack down on the kidnappers if the three soldiers 
were not released by nightfall the spokesman said 
asked after sundown whether amal had taken direct action to 
rescue the irishmen he said no apparently they are still 
considering giving peaceful efforts a chance 
he declined to say to which group the kidnappers belonged but 
said they are known to amal the un force and police 
three other irish unifil soldiers were seized on thursday by 
armed residents of tibnin in retaliation for the kidnapping 
but they were released an hour later when amal promised villagers 
that the un force would seek to locate kasfi and bring him back 
the afternoon clashes at sidon were touched off when two 
palestinians were killed by a rocketpropelled grenade fired by amal 
gunners near the ein elhilweh palestinian refugee camp police said 
the battles with mortars grenades and machine guns raged after 
nightfall on sidons southern outskirts triggering fears of a major 
confrontation that would negate a 20monthold syrianbrokered truce 
amal fought a twoyear war with the palestinians before the truce 
took hold more than 1500 people were killed and 3500 wounded in 
the fighting in which syrianbacked amal tried to prevent plo 
chairman yasser arafat from rebuilding the lebanon power base he 
lost in israels 1982 invasion

a proposed revision of the soviet penal code says 
convicts may be executed for crimes ranging from treason to rape and 
allows authorities to hold people under arrest in isolation 
official media said friday 
the twopage draft revision the first result of a longpromised 
change in the criminal laws appeared in the government newspaper 
izvestia 
the draft apparently does not deal with the two sections of the 
penal code most criticized by western human rights activists the 
code now allows authorities to imprison people on charges of 
antisoviet slander and antisoviet agitation 
the proposed revision has been submitted to the two houses of the 
supreme soviet or parliament for discussion the deputies were 
asked to submit their conclusions to the presidium or chief 
executive body of parliament by march 15 the official news agency 
tass said 
one new section would permit authorities to keep people under 
arrest in isolation for one to three months with the exception of 
women who are pregnant or have children under the age of eight 
a series of crimes which are not included in the current code and 
which would be punishable by death under extraordinary 
circumstances are listed in the draft the draft does not say what 
the circumstances would be 
betrayal of the state spying terrorist acts sabotage 
premeditated murder under aggravating cirumstances and rape of 
minors could be punishable by death 
under the provisions of the draft the death sentence could not 
be applied to people under the age of 18 and over the age of 60 
although the revised code is more severe concerning arrest and 
capital punishment certain punishments have been dropped 
exile and deportation two measures that prohibit a person from 
living in certain cities are not included in the draft under 
current law the two measures are listed under types of 
punishment 
in the past dissidents often were exiled or deported as part of 
their sentence helping to fragment the dissident movement

a former chairman of the board of trustees of 
catholic university testified friday that the facultys academic 
freedoms were never clearly spelled out and therefore are not 
binding on the administration 
the board never defined academic freedom said cardinal 
joseph bernardin unless they approved a statement it is not 
binding said bernardin currently archbishop of chicago 
court papers revealed that in july 1968 the board of trustees 
adopted a statement ensuring academic freedom at the university 
lawyers for the rev charles e curran are seeking to prove that 
when catholic university revoked his right to teach theology 
university officials violated his academic freedom 
the nonjury trial included the testimony of two of the churchs 
highest officials in the country 
curran 54 is an ordained priest whose disagreement with church 
teachings on homosexuality birth control and other positions were 
pubished in his book faithful dissent afterward vatican 
officials revoked currans canonical mission to teach catholic 
theology 
cardinal james a hickey archibishop of washington and 
chancellor of the university thursday testified that the church had 
the authority to decide when an ordained priest no longer spoke for 
the church 
when the vatican revoked his priviledges curran was suspended by 
hickey 
catholic university was founded in 1885 as one of a few 
pontifical universities directly governed by the church 
bernardin testified the university risked severing its 
relationship with the church if it had not suspended curran 
if we were to directly defy the holy see the school risked 
having its charter revoked he said 
monsignor frederick mcmanus a catholic university canon law 
professor and the principal author of the canonical statutes said 
hickey played an honorific role as chancellor of the school and 
did not have the authority to decide who should or should not teach 
there 
currans lawyers arguing the case before superior court judge 
frederick h weisberg were trying to refute hickeys testimony on 
thursday that he as a representative of the vatican had the right 
to suspend curran 
curran sued the university after it revoked his right to teach 
theology on the grounds that his writings were at odds with the 
church curran had refused an offer to teach ethics outside of the 
universitys religious department he had taught at the school for 
22 years 
hickey archbishop of washington said he merely was enforcing 
the highest order of the church to suspend curran after the vatican 
revoked his right to teach roman catholic theology 
the university claims curran must obey the revocation of his 
mission to teach however curran counters that he never had such a 
mission and his contract is the same as other tenured professors at 
the university 
currans attorney paul saunders is seeking to prove that curran 
had no knowledge of his canonical mission and that hickeys 
suspension of curran was not sanctioned by canon law 
following his 1987 suspension curran served as a visiting 
professor at cornell he now has a oneyear appointment at the 
university of california los angeles

a federal jury friday convicted political 
maverick lyndon h larouche jr of 13 counts of tax and mail fraud 
conspiracy for cheating federal tax collectors as well as his 
supporters whose loans were never repaid 
after less than two days of deliberations the jury of eight 
women and four men also convicted six larouche associates of mail 
fraud and conspiracy in the case of 30 million in defaulted loans 
chief us district judge albert v bryan jr set sentencing for 
jan 27 
larouche a perennial independent presidential candidate who 
condemned the convictions as an obscene miscarriage of justice 
faces a maximum penalty of 65 years in prison and fines totaling 
325 million 
the other six face lesser penalties for their roles on the mail 
fraud and conspiracy charges 
the six are william wertz who was larouches chief fundraiser 
edward spannaus his legal coordinator and fundraisers michael 
billington dennis small paul greenberg and joyce rubinstein 
larouche 66 and the six aides were charged with mail fraud and 
conspiracy for allegedly raising more than 30 million in loans from 
supporters without any intention of repaying them 
all seven defendants were convicted of all 48 counts in the 
indictment returned on oct 14 by a federal grand jury they 
remained free on their own recognizance until sentencing 
larouche who did not testify in his own defense stood rigidly 
facing the jury with his arms crossed in front of him as a clerk 
recited the guilty verdict on all 13 counts against him afterward 
he sat down without a word or gesture ms rubinstein broke into 
tears and fell into the arms of a friend after she left the 
courtroom 
defense attorneys said they planned to appeal the convictions 
larouche told a news conference later that his conviction was a 
wrong gross disgusting obscene miscarriage of justice which he 
said was the result of a long campaign of hate by the news media 
and friends of the soviet union within the federal government 
the way the jury voted im dead he said adding that he 
fully expects to be killed in prison if his conviction is upheld in 
appeals courts 
but larouche said he would leave behind an international 
antibolshevik resistance that his followers were willing to 
fight and die for 
under questioning by reporters larouche said repeatedly that he 
felt no remorse for what happened to those who loaned money to his 
organization many of them elderly people who have never gotten 
their money back 
they were wronged not by us but by the government he said 
larouche said it was the government that forced several of his 
groups into involuntary bankruptcy and thus prevented his 
organization from repaying the loans 
government prosecutor john markham said he did not regard the 
verdict as a victory 
i consider this an obvious conclusion to a long pattern of 
false statements to trusting senior citizens he said their 
dreams for their retirement are gone its a sad case 
in addition to the charges connected with the loans larouche was 
accused of conspiracy to defraud the internal revenue service by 
having all his personal expenses paid by various corporations he 
controls and claiming he had no taxable income 
government prosecutors said larouche has not filed federal income 
tax returns for any year since 1978 and that he conspired to conceal 
the expenses that were paid on his behalf 
a separate criminal case involving larouche and 18 of his 
followers is rescheduled for retrial in us district court in 
boston starting feb 27 
in that case larouche is charged with conspiring to obstruct 
justice in connection with allegedly unauthorized use of credit 
cards to raise 1 million for his 1984 presidential campaign 
during 15 days of testimony in federal court in alexandria a 
parade of prosecution witnesses testified that they had loaned 
hundreds of thousands of dollars to the larouche organization but 
got little if any of their money back 
one lender was elizabeth sexton of suffield conn who said she 
was never repaid the 112800 she loaned to a larouche organization 
to help finance an antidrug book ms sexton said that when the 
barrel ran dry in her personal funds a persistent larouche 
fundraiser persuaded her to try to obtain a bank loan so she could 
lend more money 
some of the most damaging testimony from a government witness was 
given by charles tate who told jurors that wertz told his 
fundraising staff that there was no such thing as a loan 
tate a former security aide who quit the larouche staff in 1984 
quoted wertz as ordering his staff to try to have the loans 
converted to contributions and if that were unsuccessful not repay 
them unless there was a political downside or a threatened 
lawsuit 
christian curtis a former larouche fundraiser said his 
superiors told him if youre talking to a little old lady who 
says shes going to lose her house get the money if youre talking 
to an unemployed worker get the money these people are immoral 
anyway 
curtis said larouche staffers called pigs or swine those 
supporters who complained that their loans were not being repaid as 
promised 
ms sexton said her fundraising contact assured her that her 
money was safer with the larouche organization than with her bank 
because the banks are our enemies 
but wayne hintz a former larouche finance officer and larouche 
aide franklin harrison bell both disputed government contentions 
that there was a policy not to repay the loans 
defense lawyers told the jurors there was no intent to defraud 
the lenders they argued that repayment became impossible when 
larouche and his associates were forced to divert funds toward 
resisting attacks by the news media and countering what they termed 
government harassment 
larouches lawyers and two of their witnesses a tax lawyer and 
an accountant contended that larouche had received goods and 
services from his various organizations as nontaxable 
compensation because larouche was an employee of those groups 
they said larouche did not have to file tax returns because he never 
earned the minimum amount currently 1100 of taxable income

a team of 17 volunteers ran into 
complications obtaining an airplane friday to take them to soviet 
armenia where they had planned to provide plastic tents for about 
3000 earthquake victims 
this is frustrating said anthony seraphin president of a 
springfieldbased company that came up with the idea for 
quicktobuild durable plastic shelters theres 17 of us here 
waiting to go and weve just heard a news report about people 
literally freezing to death at the earthquake site 
the air national guard had agreed to provide a c141 transport 
plane but needed the approval of defense secretary frank carlucci 
before the civilians could board seraphin said 
a defense department spokeswoman maj shelley rogers said 
friday night that the department received the request and it will 
be forwarded to the state department monday 
its got to get the proper approval she said 
she did not say how long the approval process could take 
soviet officials say the dec 7 quake claimed 55000 lives and 
left 500000 of the 700000 people in the area homeless 
its just so insane seraphin said were here ready to go 
and we cant get through 
seraphin said the group whose mission was being coordinated with 
the armenian relief society had hoped to leave by saturday 
union carbide corp of danbury conn which makes the resin from 
which the film is manufactured will pay the estimated 100000 cost 
of the effort 
the team wants to take material for 100 opaque blue 
576squarefoot tents that will provide shelter for 30 people each 
said union carbide spokesman john p yimoyines 
the tents will be warmed by the sun during the day but will lose 
much of their heat at night 
theyll be good wind protection and weather protection said 
lou agnello another union carbide spokesman he said the film could 
withstand temperatures as low as 50 degrees below zero without 
cracking 
seraphin said the group is also looking elsewhere for a plane

hopes for a healthy world by the turn of the 
century are threatened by discrimination against women and 
alienation of youth from their parents the head of the world health 
organization said friday 
if you fail to give education to women how can you give the 
message of aids prevention of spacing childbirths and of 
elementary sanitation and simple treatment of such childkillers as 
diarrhea asked dr hiroshi nakajima 
the new who directorgeneral departed from a prepared speech to 
declare the gap between men and women an obstacle to achieving 
whos goal of health for all by the year 2000 
in the fight against aids since there is yet neither vaccine 
treatment nor cure our only weapon against this lethal disease is 
health education and information he said in an address to the 
national council for international health and the council of 
washington representatives on the united nations 
yet if you look at reality in many developing nations the 
gap between men and women still depends on the economic climate in 
many developing countries only the men are going to school he 
said 
nakajima said who is leading not only a worldwide scientific 
search for a vaccine against aids but also with two other un 
agencies is attacking the problem of providing basic knowledge to 
women and mothers unable to read 
the other agencies are the un childrens fund and unesco the 
un educational scientific and cultural organization 
nakajima a japanese physician elected earlier this year as whos 
fourth directorgeneral said there is an urgent need for parents 
to reestablish dialogue with our children answering a 
question he said young people especially in advanced countries seem 
completely isolated from their elders experimenting with 
narcotics and unsafe sex to the detriment of health 
if we continue this kind of mistrust between generations there 
will be further deterioration of health especially in the spread 
of aids he said 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious 
disease that attacks the bodys immune system and renders it 
powerless against other illnesses 
nakajima said the long battle to eradicate tuberculosis was a 
nearsuccess until recently when in just a few months the 
situation changed in africa most probably due to the spread of aids 
infection which decreased immunity and even some parts of the 
united states like in new york city reported increased 
tuberculosis 
he praised president reagans message to the recent world 
conference on aids as a very powerful contribution to the fight 
against the most serious disease of this century reagan upheld 
the individual human rights of those infected while declaring them 
responsible to ensure that the virus is not transmitted to others 
nakajima noted 
surgeon general dr c everett koop has provided strong support 
to who in its campaigns against both aids and smoking nakajima 
said asserting that tobacco causes 25 million premature deaths a 
year and 90 percent of lung cancer cases 
he voiced hope that the united states will quickly pay 75 
million in overdue un assessments earmarked for the health 
organization now that who has undertaken financial and personnel 
reforms demanded by congress

a gay rights leader warned friday that outraged 
voters will remember a judges statement that he gave a lighter 
sentence to a murderer partly because his two victims were 
homosexuals 
these two guys that got killed wouldnt have been killed if 
they hadnt been cruising the streets picking up teenage boys 
state district judge jack hampton told the dallas times herald in 
fridays editions 
i dont much care for queers cruising the streets picking up 
teenage boys he said thursday ive got a teenage boy 
hampton 56 who hs been on the bench eight years said the 
homosexualty of the murder victims entered into his decision on nov 
28 to give the 18yearold killer a 30year prison term instead of a 
maximum life sentence 
the judge said he would have given a harsher sentence to richard 
lee bednarski if his victims had been for example a couple of 
housewives out shopping not hurting anybody 
hampton expressed no reservations about his statements the 
newspaper reported 
just spell my name right hampton said if it makes anybody 
mad theyll forget it by 1990 election year 
hampton did not return a telephone call from the associated press 
william waybourn president of the dallas gay alliance said the 
organizations eight telephone lines began ringing constantly after 
the newspaper published the judges statements 
he said he hopes hamptons remarks will prompt the public to work 
to remove him from the bench when he comes up for reelection 
judge hampton said it himself no one will remember this in 
1990 but we will remember waybourn said 
being at the wrong place at the wrong time is just a tragedy 
waybourn said of the killings im sorry for the families of the 
men who were killed they dont deserve this and hampton doesnt 
deserve to be a judge 
robert flowers executive director of the state commission on 
judicial conduct declined to comment on hamptons statements and 
said the 11member commission would investigate if a complaint were 
filed 
a judges discretion is his or her own flowers said and 
generally we havent had too many occasions where the judge has 
spoken about what his thought process has been in sentencing 
flowers also said the commission occasionally initiates an 
investigation itself but declined to say whether that would happen 
in hamptons case 
the texas human rights foundation filed a complaint against 
hampton with the judicial conduct commission 
the statements by judge hampton constitute judicial 
misconduct said tom doyal legal director for the nonprofit 
group active in gay and lesbian issues 
doyal said hamptons remarks show open disregard for the laws 
of our state he has created an entirely new class of crime murder 
of expendable classes of people 
hampton said he rejected a prosecution request for a life 
sentence for bednarski because he believed the murder victims were 
not completely blameless 
these homosexuals by running around on weekends picking up 
teenage boys theyre asking for trouble he said they really 
are 
a richland college student at the time of his conviction 
bednarski was convicted in the shooting deaths of tommy lee trimble 
34 and lloyd griffin 27 
testimony revealed that bednarski and a group of nine friends 
drove to the oak lawn area of dallas to harass gay men the night of 
may 15 
the boys testified they were standing on a street corner jeering 
at passersby when bednarski persuaded another boy to join him in 
beating and robbing trimble and griffin who had invited the boys 
into their car 
the four drove to a park and walked to a hilltop clearing 
according to testimony 
testimony did not reveal whether the victims actually solicited 
sex from bednarski and his friend but the judge said i think it 
was understood by everybody that they went into the bushes for some 
oral sex 
the other youth testified that bednarski immediately pulled a 
pistol and ordered the men to take off their clothes 
when they refused bednarski drew a pistol and started shooting 
trimble died immediately griffin died three days later

the government protested friday to 
panama about violations of costa ricas southern border saying such 
incidents encourage suspicion among the two peoples 
foreign minister rodrigo madrigal nieto issued the protest in a 
letter to panamanian foreign minister jorge ritter which was 
delivered to panamanian ambassador dario arosemena gonzalez 
the letter referred to border intrusions that reportedly occurred 
last week but said such incidents have been happening regularly 
since november 1987 costa rica shares all its southern border with 
panama 
a situation has developed along the border that in no way 
should continue madrigal said in his letter 
the costa rican government is concerned not only because the 
acts violate the territorial integrity of costa rica but also 
because they foment insecurity and suspicion between the people of 
both nations the letter said 
it said the panamanian national guard aided by soldiers and 
intelligence officials held eight costa rican citizens for five 
hours last week after contraband coffee was found in a panamanian 
vehicle in costa rica 
it also said costa rican planning minister jorge monge touring 
the border area oct 11 surprised a panamanian military patrol of 
eight men in two vehicles 
when monge asked if the soldiers knew they were in costa rica 
they explained they knowingly drove in costa rica territory as a way 
to avoid poorlymaintained panamanian border roads 
hernan garron the costa rican minister of public security has 
said border residents repeatedly complain about panama violating 
costa rican sovereignty

an attorney for a man accused of beating his 
6yearold adopted daughter to death said friday they have decided 
not to file a formal insanity plea to avoid taking action that 
would poison the jurys mind 
defense attorney ira london said such a defense would require him 
to call psychiatric experts to prove that joel steinberg was insane 
it would also require that prosecution psychiatrists be allowed to 
examine steinberg 
we felt in view of the vast amount of investigation the da has 
done in this case in view of all the reports they have obtained 
whether verified or unverified it would poison the jurys mind as 
to joel london said 
it would open the door to questioning about any rumor 
anything they had about joel coming into this case he said so 
we made a determination we didnt want that 
london was referring in part to reports of steinbergs heavy drug 
use his often bizarre behavior his reported belief in cults that 
hypnotized people and used them sexually and his alleged violence 
against others 
london said he had not decided whether to continue pursuit of an 
insanity defense in which he lets the jury infer from testimony 
without defense attorneys saying explicitly that steinberg was 
crazy the night lisa was fatally injured 
steinberg 47 is a disbarred lawyer charged with seconddegree 
murder in the fatal beating of lisa a child he illegally adopted 
shortly after her birth 
the firstgrader was removed unconscious from the greenwich 
village apartment steinberg shared with his longtime companion 
hedda nussbaum 13 months ago the child died in the hospital three 
days later 
lisas death in an affluent welleducated household shocked many 
new yorkers and led to a reexamination of the duty and ability of 
neighbors teachers and social workers to recognize and report 
evidence of child abuse 
steinberg denies that he hit the girl but ms nussbaum the 
prosecutions chief witness said he told her the night lisa was 
fatally injured that he had knocked lisa down and she didnt want 
to get up 
the defense teams decision to abandon the formal insanity 
defense was announced just after state supreme court justice harold 
rothwax excused the jury for the day without any trial proceedings 
because an alternate juror was ill 
londons cocounsel adrian diluzio said the defense does not 
have to call witnesses to testify about steinbergs state of mind 
the evidence of mental disease or defect can emerge from any 
source diluzio said if the evidence emerged from the 
prosecutions witness as i would submit to you it may have then 
that may be considered by the jury as meeting our burden of going 
forward on the affirmative defense 
an example of what diluzio was talking about is found in londons 
fiveday crossexamination of ms nussbaum in which she testified 
that steinberg said and did bizarre things before lisas death 
but if london and diluzio try for an insanity defense without 
saying so prosecutors on summation will almost certainly call the 
jurys attention to it and argue that no psychiatric experts have 
been presented to support it 
and rothwax indicated he would instruct the jurors that an 
insanity defense was being offered whether the defense called it 
that or not and he would say it was up to them to decide whether 
steinberg was criminally responsible for lisas death 
the trial was to resume monday

when an italian historian recently called rome a 
corrupt vulgar and violent city that shouldnt be the nations 
capital romans rose up in anger 
but many also conceded that the eternal city that has survived 
sackings sieges and the fall of an empire appears helpless against 
the onslaughts of the 1980s not to mention what lies ahead in 
1990 when italy serves as host to the world cup soccer tournament 
rome has virtually no major projects under way to prepare for an 
event comparable to the olympics 
chaotic traffic air and noise pollution crumbling monuments and 
inadequate public transportation are some of the symptoms of modern 
romes problems 
the central government has never really had any interest in 
governing rome says francesco donofrio a former christian 
democrat senator who is one of many who favor moving government 
offices out of the historic center 
there is a proposal though still far from being realized to 
build a government and business center on 1600 acres on the eastern 
edge of the city 
rome isnt really a capital its a work of art and works of 
art ought not to be capitals said the american author gore vidal 
who has kept an apartment in central rome for 26 years 
while italy has experienced great economic strides in recent 
years and claims to have surpassed britain as the worlds fifth 
largest industrial power the capital has continued to suffer from 
what many here describe as secondrate services 
romans themselves have long complained about the deterioration of 
their city but it took a verbal broadside by a parliament member 
and historian from turin to push the issue to the forefront of 
national attention 
explaining why he spearheaded the defeat of a bill in 
parliaments chamber of deputies that would have allocated 156 
million for restoration of rome monuments luigi firpo declared 
rome is rotten asphyxiated by car fumes it would be useless to 
undertake major restorations it would be better to choose another 
capital for the country 
romes woes are probably best exemplified by its traffic 
nightmare an enemy that even julius caesar failed to defeat when he 
tried to ban wagons and chariots from the city center in 45 bc 
today 18 million cars and 200000 motorcycle and motorscooters 
fight for space in ancient narrow streets with only one municipal 
parking garage and no metered spaces to choose from every day some 
200000 cars end up illegally parked many on sidewalks 
despite the italians reputation for fast driving cars in rome 
travel at an average speed of 6 mph compared to 15 mph in most 
other european capitals 
the cacophony of roaring traffic honking horns and screaming 
sirens average 764 decibels 11 above the level considered 
unhealthy for humans 
the gridlock never lets up since rome actually has four rush 
hours in addition to the morning and evening crush there is the 
mad dash home for lunch and following a siesta the trip back to 
the office 
in the most drastic step taken so far the city early this year 
started banning private vehicles from entering the center from 7 
am to 10 am and 3 pm to 7 pm mondaythroughsaturday 
but the ban has only worsened the traffic on the outskirts and 
barely dented the congestion downtown because thousands of special 
permits are given to parliament members government officials 
journalists doctors judges and others 
the roman public eagerly wants the traffic problem to be 
resolved but each of us rejects even the idea of leaving the car 
in the garage for two or three days a week columnist miriam mafai 
wrote in la repubblica italys largest daily newspaper 
those who choose public transporation arent muh better off 
buses are so crowded that passengers shove and scream for a space to 
breathe while pickpockets have a field day 
romes metropolitana subway has only two lines and 155 miles 
of track and transports only 400000 passengers a day onefourth 
the total of paris subway the metro officials say they cant dig 
further because of all the archaelogical treasures lying beneath the 
city 
the lack of public transportation is one reason why 63 percent of 
romans drive to work each day the resulting exhaust fumes make rome 
one of the most polluted cities in europe prompting some bicyclists 
and traffic cops to don surgical masks and leading italys greens 
party to propose that the entire city be put under curfew once smog 
reaches a certain level 
the smog also eats away at the citys ancient monuments leaving 
arches columns and buildings concealed behind green cloth and 
scaffolding for painstaking restorations that last years and deny 
tourists a look at some of the symbols of imperial rome 
in the last quarter century rome has absorbed some 2 million 
immigrants from other parts of italy but very few urban development 
projects have been carried out since rome hosted the 1960 olympics 
plans for an archaelogical park extending from the colosseum to 
the old appian way a railroad ring around the city and an 
underground tunnel have once again been put on hold 
it will be a pity if rome is unable to capitalize on this huge 
opportunity said luca di montezemolo head of the italian 
organizing committee two years ago i thought rome could have 
benefited the way it did from the 1960 olympics but it looks too 
late now 
as public services including electrical and telephone have 
broken down so have the patience tempers and manners of many 
romans just watch them pushing and cursing each other as they try 
to beat the line at a bank or post office 
sociologists have noted a rise in violence and racial 
intolerance including an incident in which an african woman was 
chased off a bus by passengers shouting leave the seats to the 
whites 
for all its detractors rome still has its eternal supporters 
said novelist alberto moravia 
rome is what the italians want it to be all types of italians 
live and work in rome rome is a crosssection of italy 
rome has always gone to ruin but at the same time it has 
always been very much alive

rock superstar phil collins wanted a supporting 
role when he did his first movie and he didnt want to sing in it 
because he wanted to be taken seriously as an actor 
instead hes playing the title role in buster the story of 
buster edwards one of the men who pulled off britains great 
train robbery in 1963 he also talked himself into singing two 
songs two hearts which plays over the buster credits and 
groovy kind of love a hit single 
id have been happy going in at the shallow end rather than the 
deep end he says its a mine field rock stars acting 
critics have praised collins performance though they were lukewarm 
to the movie itself 
collins also didnt intend to put himself in danger in his movie 
acting debut however for an early scene establishing buster as a 
smalltime thief collins said hed bash in a store window himself 
using a metal garbage can 
a stuntman said the dustbin could bounce back and hit me in the 
face he told me to hold it up in front of my face and make sure no 
huge splinters fell down and cut my head off 
collins had beginners luck when i break the huge plateglass 
window go in get the dummy and come out that was one take he 
says 
director david green got the idea of casting collins as buster 
after seeing the rocker in his first acting role as the host of a 
rigged game show on a miami vice episode 
collins described buster as a bit different from most 
villains 
a professional thief is what he was he came out of prison and 
went straight back inside for shoplifting for 13 years he has been 
on the straight hes got a flower shop outside waterloo station 
hes become a bit of a tourist attraction 
collins met buster edwards weve become very good pals he 
says in personality i dont think were that far away hes a 
very friendly bloke i think i am too our backgrounds are 
different and we come from different parts of london since i was 5 
or 6 i just wanted to be involved with music he obviously didnt 
have that kind of dream when kids were going around causing trouble 
i was home practicing the drums 
collins became a drummer in the hit british group genesis he 
revived the groups career in 1976 by stepping forward as vocalist 
and then he became a major rock soloist 
the movie takes a certain amount of poetic license collins said 
busters wife june julie walters returns to england from mexico 
where theyd fled buster followed because of his love for her in 
reality the rocker says june didnt like mexico and they went 
back to england together he walked into a police station and gave 
himself up in the early 60s if youre working class you never 
traveled far you didnt eat spicy food or have a suntan 
when shooting began the director kept collins away from the 
rushes fearing hed see things hed want to do over then collins 
happened to walk in while rushes were being shown one day 
i saw a scene i didnt think i was very good in where i come 
home from the robbery and have a confrontation with junes mother 
he liked it which gave him confidence 
collins sister carole plays a nosy neighbor in the film she 
auditioned for the part and got it she doesnt do it for a living 
just the odd thing she has her own talent agency for adults she 
was a professional ice skater for many years he said 
my mother is an agent for kids my brother is a cartoonist my 
father had the normal job in the family he was in insurance in the 
city of london for 40 years 
collins said he wouldnt do the music and put the production 
company in touch with lamont dozier but he wound up being involved 
afterall 
he came up with a couple of songs that needed words i thought 
i should write the words because i was so involved with the film 
and the part i felt i could summarize the feelings in the lyrics 
collins got involved in helping choose other music in the film 
too such as i got you babe by sonny and cher and sweets for 
my sweet by the searchers which was no 1 the week of the robbery 
a groovy kind of love was an uptempo hit for the mindbenders 
in the 60s i thought it would be nice to have a slow version in 
the radio for background somewhere i did a little demo at home and 
the director liked it so much he used it at the end over the 
arrest when i get taken away collins said 
we looked at a list of songs we could use in the film 10 
seconds of some of them he said theyre all just on the radio 
they give an indication of the period 
the only song thats loud is the four tops goin loco down in 
acapulco when they first get to mexico lamont and i wrote it 
but lawyers wouldnt allow them to use any songs by the beatles 
i found that very frustrating i rang all the surviving beatles 
they said yes but the lawyers wouldnt let us i couldnt work 
out why 
collins would like to do another film playing a different type 
of character he has an idea for a remake of goldilocks and the 
three bears starring himself and three other actors

breakneck efforts to expand the economy 
is exacting an enormous human price in south korea thousands of 
workers are killed or crippled every year in what critics claim is 
the worlds highest industrial accident rate 
the economic miracle has transformed south korea in 30 years from 
a poor backward nation into an industrial powerhouse but little 
attention has been paid to the cost of the rapid growth 
an average of five workers are killed and 390 are injured every 
day in accidents in every kind of workplace from huge factories and 
shipyards to backstreet sweatshops employing two or three people 
in 1987 1761 workers were killed in job accidents and 25244 
were maimed according to government figures in the three years 
from 1985 to 1987 5139 workers were killed and 66991 were maimed 
the figures show 
the number of serious accidents is increasing as the economy 
grows the accident rate rose from 654 deaths and 2717 crippling 
accidents in 1972 to the 1987 total the figures show 
the korean federation of labor unions and academic experts using 
figures from international labor sources contend south korea has 
the worlds highest industrial accident rate safety standards are 
not enforced and the government and businesses are concerned only 
with economic growth they claim 
south koreas accident rate is five times greater than 
neighboring japans or taiwan and about 15 times higher than western 
nations officials said 
labor ministry officials deny that south korea has the worlds 
worst accident rate but said they did not know of a nation with a 
higher one 
the international labor organization an arm of the united 
nations in geneva said it does not compile comparative figures on 
industrial accidents 
government officials acknowledge that little has been done to 
enforce safety and health regulations and many people work in 
dangerous conditions the government wants to cut the accident rate 
in half by 1990 they say 
its shameful to have such a high industrial accident rate 
said kim jungkyu who heads the ministry of labors safety section 
labor union activists maintain that the main causes of accidents 
are poor working conditions and pressure on workers to meet 
production schedules at any price 
many factories have little or no safety gear and workers spend 
up to 12 hours a day in deafening poorly lit and overheated 
workspaces where they become fatigued and easily make mistakes that 
cause accidents activists said 
many workers spend their days in terrible dehumanizing 
conditions where they are considered virtually expendable there are 
always more workers ready to work said one activist 
past authoritarian governments played a major role in planning 
and directing south koreas rapid economic and industrial expansion 
the governments allowed businesses to ignore or scrimp on safety and 
helped suppress labor protests 
the labor ministrys safety section which is responsible for 
enforcing safety nationwide for more than 6 million industrial 
workers has a staff of 13 people 
while insisting that the government attitude has changed kim 
said safety still is ignored by many employers many companies save 
money by not installing safety devices or training workers to use 
equipment he said 
park sangnak a top safety official with the korean federation 
of labor unions said it is cheaper for companies to pay 
compensation to injured workers than spend money on safety equipment 
employers pay marginal compensation for accident victims under 
korean law maximum compensation for the family of a worker killed 
in an accident provides enough money to live on for just two or 
three years officials said 
the growing sophistication of korean industry is adding to safety 
problems and accident rates rather than cutting them as in other 
nations officials say 
many companies eager to get ahead often introduce advanced 
equipment before their workers are capable of using it safely 
government and labor officials said 
companies have gotten big by using new tools advanced 
technology and dangerous chemicals park said but workers have 
not been given adequate education or training 
but kim of the labor ministry said many workers are indifferent 
to safety and he claimed that carelessness is one of the main causes 
of accidents 
many workers do not wear helmets goggles or heatproof 
clothing even when it is provided 
labor unions and political parties are pressing the government to 
take drastic action to enforce safety regulations and cut accidents 
poor safety is the second main cause of strikes after wage demands 
president roh taewoos administration which took office in 
february says it wants to drastically reduce industrial accidents 
as part of its efforts to improve life for the working classes 
roh hopes to attract more public support for his administration 
and defuse potential worker unrest the government no longer 
automatically sides with management and has encouraged companies to 
give raises and other concessions 
the labor ministry plans a major survey of businesses to ensure 
safety regulations are enforced and to cut accidents by more than 
half by 1990 
but a government plan to increase safety spending by 280 percent 
in 1989 will still mean just 174 million is available far below 
the levels of most industrial nations plans for more safety 
inspectors will add just a few dozen personnel 
labor leaders call the plan inadequate

in the midst of the enthusing over soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev and the remarkable reforms he has launched in 
the soviet union a pbs special wednesday reminds that all is not 
rosy on the other side of the iron curtain 
the title of the documentary czechoslovakia the long wait for 
spring refers to the prague spring of 1968 when reforms 
introduced by premier alexander dubcek raised hopes for new freedom 
after 20 years of hardline communism 
a few months later those hopes were crushed under the treads of 
invading soviet tanks today little evidence remains in 
czechoslovakia of the prague spring which ironically soviet 
citizens seem to be enjoying under gorbachevs policy of 
glasnost 
the documentary crams a lot of historical economic and 
sociopolitical information into one hour but also gives the 
country a human face 
viewers are taken on a whirlwind tour of the country from 
prague just as modern and beautiful as many other european cities 
at least on the surface to the grimy ironsmelting plants that seem 
to have been lifted from another era 
indeed the factories represent czechoslovakias biggest problem 
economic dependence on the soviet union to support an outdated 
heavy manufacturing industry czechoslovakia has little access to 
other markets except for its pilsner beer urquell which is 
exported to the west 
in addition czechoslovakia is one of the most polluted countries 
in europe with its reliance on cheap brown coal for heating and 
manufacturing 
there are interviews with dissidents who hold little hope of soon 
seeing the kind of reforms that gorbachev has introduced in the 
soviet union 
you have to have a gorbachev and in czechoslovakia so far no 
one like that has appeared says zdenek mlynar a member of the 
dubcek government who was interviewed in vienna where he lives in 
exile forty years of hardline communism and an economy hogtied by 
entrenched stalinism will be hard to erase he says now the word 
is go your own way but we have been crippled 
other dissidents who took a chance just by being interviewed 
are part of a writers group that was subjected to a government 
crackdown after calling for recognition of human rights one of 
them we are told had been arrested five times before the interview 
and again at least once since 
even more depressing than their own oppression is the dissidents 
despair over a spiritless new generation that has turned to drugs 
and cares little for anything other than obtaining material 
possessions 
there is no aim of life and everywhere you look you see the 
result of this crisis says ivan klima an author who has been 
published in the west i think the young generation is rather 
unpolitical and rather apathetic they dont see any sense to fight 
for any value 
the filmmakers also interview communist party members who seem to 
live well under the system and enthusiastically support the 
government but the filmmakers are careful to stress that these 
citizens were selected for interview by the authorities 
despite the problems lurking around the bend czechoslovakia 
currently has the highest standard of living of any communist 
country the governments agreement with the people says the 
narration is well keep your stomachs full if you keep your 
mouths shut 
nevertheless there are tiny signs of change czech filmmakers 
are allowed to tackle such subjects as drug abuse hooliganism 
and the black market in foreign currency and the lack of 
spirituality in the society has sparked a new interest in religion 
especially among young people 
the film a production of wttw in chicago was produced by george 
vicas a veteran television journalist who started out with the 
cbs reports unit headed by edward r murrow he went on to work 
for nbc and produce other documentaries for pbs as well as the 
national geographic series 
the principal writer of the film is journalist sanford ungar 
dean of the school of communications at american university in 
washington dc whose father was born in czechoslovakia 
the documentary is a pilot for a possible new series on eastern 
bloc countries

baltimore mayor kurt l schmoke who 
launched a national debate on legalizing drugs earlier this year 
jokes that hes often introduced lately as a man who once had a 
bright future 
schmoke a former federal and state prosecutor acknowledges his 
views on decriminalizing drugs are not popular among politicians and 
says he would have dodged the issue if someone had raised it during 
his race for the mayors office in 1987 
and yet he doubts america can prosecute its way out of the drug 
problem and insists something more must be tried 
schmoke 38 was baltimore states attorney about three years ago 
when an undercover officer wired with a bugging device was gunned 
down 
i listened to him die schmoke said in an interview before 
speaking in westminster about 40 miles north of baltimore one of 
the drug dealers shot him just because this officer was in the way 
of a major profitmaking operation 
ive prosecuted thousands of drug offenders im not soft on 
crime but as a mayor and citizen i feel i have an obligation to 
call for an alternative to the bloodletting in the streets and to 
the shameful seduction of our children into the role of drug 
pushers 
thousands of calls and letters poured into schmokes office after 
he went public with his belief that the war on drugs should be led 
by the surgeon general not the attorney general 
early on i had a lot of mail very strongly negative to the 
whole idea schmoke said the way my mail is running now people 
generally feel that im wrong in my conclusion but that i was right 
to raise the issue and that the debate is healthy 
schmoke a harvardeducated rhodes scholar and first black 
elected mayor of baltimore grabbed national attention in april when 
he addressed the us conference of mayors in washington 
i was asked to give a speech about urban crime problems i had 
the speech written and then over the weekend i decided im 
changing the speech schmoke said i didnt tell anyone on my 
staff i just rewrote it called a person in to type it and gave it 
to my staff on my way into the meeting 
in revising it he added the suggestion lets at least have a 
national debate about decriminalizing drugs 
he explained i thought that either i would be dismissed as a 
kook or the issue would catch hold and cause a major debate 
five months later he testified before the house select committee 
on narcotics where his ideas got a chilly reception from some 
politicians 
for nearly two hours schmoke told committee members that 
expecting the criminal justice system to solve the drug problem was 
unrealistic 
he suggested eliminating criminal penalties for possession of 
marijuana providing addicts with methadone maintenance and 
increasing emphasis on treatment prevention and education schmoke 
also called for a highlevel commission to study the potential 
impact of decriminalization 
the biggest misconception is that people think i favor people 
using drugs which is not true at all schmoke said alcohol is 
legal but we dont favor kids drinking scotch 
what i am saying is that the drug issue is twofold its the 
problem of abuse and the problem of crime associated with drug 
trafficking the criminal justice system might be good dealing with 
one but its sure not good dealing with the abuse problem 
if addicts had access to drugs through the public health system 
and not through criminals they would not have to steal and break 
into houses and shoot people in order to get to the substance 
schmoke says hes encouraged that his comments have prompted a 
debate 
rep charles b rangel dny chairman of the narcotics 
committee is emphatically against any form of legalization 
he says its a dangerous idea i feel that we must not 
surrender in the war on drugs before weve even fought it said 
robert weiner spokesman for rangel he asks what do we do about 
all the international treaties we signed to stop the flow of drugs 
he asks what kind of message legalization would send to young 
people and wouldnt it counter our antidrug education programs 
some athletes who had been taking antidrug messages to baltimore 
area schools resigned from the education program after schmoke 
testified in washington weiner noted they said why should we do 
that if the mayor is talking about legalizing drugs for addicts 
however rep james h scheuer dny another committee member 
praised schmokes testimony and said he too believes its time to 
set up a bipartisan commission 
such a commission could avoid some of the political posturing 
about drug issues that emerges as sure as the sun rises in the east 
during every election year said scheuer who believes america is 
spending too much money on interdiction and enforcement and not 
enough on treatment education and prevention 
minneapolis police chief tony bouza agrees with schmokes call 
for developing a national stategy to attack the drug problem 
in 1966 president johnson created the presidents commission 
on crime which in 1967 gave us a blueprint for the future gave us 
a national strategy we now need to replicate that effort bouza 
said 
schmoke has really helped a lot by basically calling for stop 
the music and lets bring a little thought to the process

few things reflect investment fads and the 
getrichquick mentality better than the commercial real estate 
market 
there is something about this market that seems ripe for 
exploitation and since so many investors spy the opportunities 
simultaneously they tend to knock each other off boom becomes bust 
some of the biggest institutions in america have played the game 
and lost 
within the past 15 years for instance large commercial banks 
tried to manage commercial properties and found the task required a 
lot more talent than the mere understanding of an income statement 
much of the multibilliondollar financial debacle of the nations 
savings and loan associations can be traced to a lust for real 
estate profits and a departure from common sense they guessed wrong 
on their real estate ventures 
real estate partnerships sold millions of people on the idea of 
cashing in on the big tax deductions of real estate what a game 
the enterprise didnt even have to make a pretax profit tax 
deductions would be the profit 
then congress removed the tax deductions suddenly causing the 
real estate market to be one of many sellers and few buyers a 
situation that brings prices back to reality with a thud 
builders themselves are among the worst players of the game so 
true is this that it has become almost axiomatic that a sound way to 
make money in real estate is to wait until the builder gets into 
trouble and then lowball him 
decade after decade a very few investors with great foresight 
ride the real estate cycle to the top and get off leaving the vast 
majority of investors to ride it back down hot markets cool 
quickly big losses replace big hopes 
so much overbuilding has occurred during the past few years that 
rents in some areas have actually fallen in those areas says 
george puskar an authority real estate has actually been 
subsidizing corporate america 
puskar chairman of equitable real estate investment management 
observes that rents are the second biggest expense for companies 
after payroll and benefits and rents have been flat or falling 
because of the oversupply 
strangely while commercial real estate attracts innovative 
daring and often highly successful entrepreneurs as well as the 
biggest institutional investors it often has been run by the seat 
of the pants 
in the past losses meant nothing to some of these entrepreneurs 
developers and promoters because they believed tax deductions 
inflation and divine intervention would bail them out 
the tax deductions were eliminated inflation calmed down in the 
1980s and the divine interveners became occupied elsewhere only 
then did some investors learn that real estate is a business 
it isnt after all like stocks and bonds which have liquid 
markets hot real estate markets seem to be made up of all buyers 
but in a flash they become markets of all sellers the sun belt 
experience illustrates 
puskar states the newer businesslike approach 
you want to position investments in properties that will have 
strong steady cash flows over time and not be subject to boombust 
cycles you cant be successful looking to buy in on a surge and 
sell quickly before a drop 
still if the past remains a criterion something new will be 
introduced into markets in 1989 that will resurrect the same old 
bullish enthusiams that lead to disaster 
what will it be hard to say however there is growing concern 
among important corporations owning firstclass real estate that 
they keep on the books at only a fraction of its market value 
thats a dangerous practice these days because it might invite 
raiders the raiders might not want the company and its products 
nearly so much as that undervalued real estate they think they 
might make a killing on that 
it could be the start of something big

it is the governments jobcreating answer to an economic crisis 
that has led to wage strikes food riots and a flight of its people 
in hazardous boat journeys across the caribbean 
critics say the project geared to the columbus celebrations is a 
giant boondoggle that is fueling inflation while failing to tackle 
the needs of the nations 66 million people half of whom are 
involved in agriculture 
they accuse the 81yearold balaguer who is nearly blind with 
glaucoma of acting like an egyptian pharaoh building pyramids 
balaguer is remodeling the city to the memory of columbus 
said francisco pena gomes a former santo domingo mayor and 
political opponent of balaguer but these are unproductive works 
because the agriculture sector has most of the work force whereas 
construction only employs 5 percent 
much though not all of the construction is timed for the 
anniversary in 1992 of columbus first voyage to the new world 
dating back to 1492 and the place where columbus remains are 
said to be buried santo domingo is hoping to attract thousands of 
tourists for the 500th anniversary 
the projects showcase is a 777foot columbus lighthouse with 
beams forming a cross rising above a rundown neighborhood near the 
airport at a cost of 30 million it is the butt of ridicule 
these days lighthouses arent used by boats or planes said 
juan bosch a former president and balaguer opponent so tell me 
what is the reason for this 
government officials contend the works project has created 
210000 jobs and is underpinning an economy in transition from 
reliance on the sugar industry its mainstay for 400 years 
i know my policy of construction has received a lot of 
criticism balaguer said in an interview but it has been 
necessary to revitalize a stagnated economy and to produce jobs 
everyone criticized the versaille palace too said chief 
economic planner guillermo caram and look at all the treaties 
that were signed there who knows maybe in 1992 there will be an 
armistice signed at the lighthouse between the worlds debtors and 
creditors 
by comparison with impoverished haiti with which it shares the 
island of hispaniola the dominican republic is welloff and 
politically stable 
but economic growth nosedived in 1988 to 28 percent from 8 
percent in 1987 according to government figures one of every three 
workers is unemployed and inflation is officially pegged at 30 
percent and estimated by private economists at twice that rate 
the countrys 35 billion foreign debt equals 68 percent of its 
gross national product the government has paid 780 million in 
interest and servicing on the debt this year but balaguer says 
relief will be sought with creditors because the national reality 
is that we are not in a condition to pay 
from the daily apagones electrical blackouts that often 
last hours to the proliferation of street hawkers evidence of 
economic distress abounds 
at the us consulate hundreds of dominicans line up daily 
hoping for a chance to go the united states easily exhausting the 
countrys yearly quota of 20000 immigrant visas us officials say 
1 million dominicans are in the united states more than half 
illegally 
boat people cross the dangerous 90mile mona passage separating 
the dominican republic and puerto rico they sell refrigerators 
ovens and televisions for the 500 to 3000 passage in flimsy 
yola motor fishing boats 
puerto rican authorities say some 3000 dominicans have been 
arrested since april countless others make it across 
the government has recently been hit by a wave of wage strikes 
that many fear will fuel protests similar to ones in february and 
march when price hikes in gasoline milk and rice caused street 
clashes that left six people dead and dozens injured 
in santo domingo with 2 million inhabitants an estimated 
500000 people are living in unsanitary crowded shacks as they wait 
for new housing projects because the government bulldozed their 
homes to make way for a beltway 
ive been waiting four months for a new home said 
61yearold juana sofia lubierez whose family of 11 is sharing a 
oneroom house built by the government as temporary shelter after 
her eightroom house was flattened 
and look at us she said were living like pigs theres 
no water no lights no bathroom 
many blame the countrys problems on the depressed sugar 
industry which has been battered by us import quotas low world 
prices and increased competition from beet and corn sweeteners 
from 1975 to 1981 the dominican republic exported an average 
815000 tons of sugar a year to the united states the us quota 
for imports of dominican sugar in 1988 was 176710 tons the cuts 
forced up to 60000 out of work in the last two years and reduced 
foreign exchange earnings by 80 million 
there are efforts to diversify the economy away from its heavy 
dependence on sugar but the only sector showing significant 
improvement is tourism which has provided 676 million in foreign 
exchange this year the countrys nine dutyfree zones accounted for 
an additional 400 million in exports to the united states 
to brake the falling value of the dominican peso the government 
closed foreignexchange centers and cracked down on a lucrative 
black market when the peso fell from 33 us cents to 12 in march 
1987 it has since stabilized and is valued at about 15 cents 
meanwhile building for the future goes on 
balaguers vision of the dominican republic is different from 
others and theres a lot of criticism that he thinks the country 
will be another egypt said a foreign diplomat but is he right 
or is he wrong the economy is suffering but who knows if in the 
long term he isnt right

for nearly half this 
century two charismatic intellectuals with opposing ideologies have 
dominated politics in the dominican republic 
joaquin balaguer the conservative incumbent president and juan 
bosch his socialist foe belong to an old breed of latin american 
leader a caudillo 
the caudillo is a social political phenomenom of latin 
america a product of our underdeveloped society said victor 
gomes berges a former foreign minister under balaguer balaguer 
and bosch are the residues of this phenomenom 
balaguer is 81 years old and nearly blind from glaucoma but 
otherwise in apparently good health 
bosch is 79 and equally robust both attribute their health to 
hard work strict diet and no alcohol neither shows signs of 
slowing down 
it may not be logical that a man who cant see can be 
president but ive done it said balaguer in an interview 
both bosch and balaguer are fiction writers poets and 
historians each has more than 20 books to his credit both are 
savvy both have mass appeal but they approach politics from 
opposing poles 
balaguer rose to power under the repressive dictatorship of gen 
rafael trujillo becoming his president trujillo was assassinated 
in 1961 and balaguer fled into exile a year later to new orleans 
where he remained until 1965 
he defeated bosch in the presidential election in 1966 and has 
been elected president three other times most recently in 1986 his 
fouryear term expires in may 1990 
asked if he plans to run against bosch his declared opponent 
balaguer said at my age i dont make definite plans 
but dominicans expect a balaguerbosch rematch 
educated in philosophy and law balaguer published this year a 
witty introspective book memories of a courtesan in the era of 
trujillo 
in it he says he attempts to explain his role in the trujillo 
government which despite brutal humanrights violation left 
balaguers reputation largely untainted 
is there a valid morality for actions in political life and 
another very different one for private life balaguer writes i 
dont know but what is certain is that politics puts blinders on 
men and converts them into docile instruments of causes which we 
intimately reject 
bosch went into exile in europe during trujillos rule and 
returned when trujillo was assassinated two years later in 1963 
he was elected president it was the countrys freest election in 38 
years 
but seven months into his term boschs marxistinspired politics 
resulted in a military coup in 1965 a popular uprising called 
bosch back instead president lyndon b johnson ordered an invasion 
by us military forces 
johnson had even come to my inauguration bosch said in a 
recent interview afterwards he said i was a communist and sent 
in the marines if i was a communist id be secretary of the 
communist party 
a high school dropout bosch is a selfeducated man whose 
intellect has earned him literary recognition and the nickname 
professor bosch 
he leads the leftist dominican liberation party which he founded 
bosch says hes not a marxist except in the sense i follow 
marxs economic theories but politically i am not a communist 
he said he believes franklin d roosevelt was the last great 
statesman a social democrat

prehistoric caves in france and spain romes 
coliseum or athens acropolis egypts mystic pyramids its hard to 
imagine the mediterranean world without its most famous landmarks 
but the areas monuments face an uncertain future as they become 
caught up in a push toward lucrative mass tourism that could 
endanger them 
indicative of the dilemma facing the regions planners is the 
view of sayed moussa egypts head of tourism promotion who 
acknowledges that history and the tourist dollar can be at odds 
antiquities officials are so jealous of their rocks he said 
we have commercial interests to consider 
from another point of view antiquities officials throughout the 
area decry the uproar caused when saving monuments requires 
difficult decisions affecting tourists 
we in egypt are constantly reminded that our monuments belong 
not only to egypt but to the world said mutawie balboush head 
of antiquities for upper egypt where 23 restoration teams are 
working to save failing structures 
as a region the mediterranean basin is the worlds biggest 
tourist attraction host to more than a third of all international 
travelers the regions 18 countries this year alone welcomed well 
over 110 million visitors 80 percent of them in spain italy and 
france if experts are correct 450 million to 700 million annual 
visitors will head to the med by 2025 
tourism is not new to the mediterranean egypt and the rest of 
the middle east already were ancient when history buffs alexander 
the great julius caesar and napoleon bonaparte took time out from 
conquest to go sightseeing 
in most countries revenue from tourism is set aside at least 
partly for saving antiquities 
but transporting tourists pours exhaust fumes into the air 
tourists stir up dust with their footsteps touch fragile wall 
paintings with sweaty hands or mar them with graffiti many ascend 
shaky monuments like mountain goats for just the right photo 
even by breathing tourists damage some monuments 
throughout the region a staggering growth in tourism has 
prompted selfdefense decisions by antiquities officials 
in spain visited by 50 million tourists in 1988 officials a 
decade ago closed the altamira caves with their 12000yearold wall 
paintings of bison and horses the images had been damaged seriously 
by a sharp rise in humidity and temperature generated by 1000 
visitors a day in 1982 the main cave was reopened but access 
limited to no more than 30 tourists a day a replica will be opened 
to all comers in 1990 
in france officials faced the same dilemma and closed the 
lescaux caves near montignac in 1963 a year after 100000 visitors 
surged into the cave network a facsimile opened in 1983 draws 
350000 visitors annually and officials have developed 
touristcontrol techniques for other caves in the dordogne region 
trying to preserve paintings while allowing visits 
in greece tourism authorities say visitors have caused no major 
damage but archaeologists counter that 30000 feet trampling on the 
acropolis floor each summers day can be doing no good in 1978 
the parthenon the fifthcentury architectural glory of athens 
golden age was roped off to the public after years of being worn 
and chipped away by visitors heels 
in italy support scaffolding and a ban on traffic in romes 
historic center have been tried to reduce monument deterioration 
from acid rain car exhausts and traffic vibrations at least 10 
percent of italys more than 50 million annual tourists go to rome 
crowding such monuments as the forum and coliseum trevi fountain 
soon is going behind a clear plastic screen to accommodate tourists 
during a yearlong restoration restorer giorgio toracca said the 
only way to stop deterioration of romes monuments would be to put 
them under glass but glass cages would change the entire view 
in egypt a glass tunnel has been inserted into a 3300yearold 
nobles tomb that tourists and time had damaged the world bank 
financed the swedish experiment as a possible solution to the 
emergency facing many of the tombs of the west bank cemetery of 
pharaohs queens royal children and courtiers the pilot project 
has remained closed to tourists however as antiquities officials 
debate its pros and cons including whether the fragile tombs 
allure remains the same to people peering through glass 
of the mediterranean countries egypt said to house more than 
half of the worlds standing monuments has suffered the most with 
the crunch of time burgeoning population subterranean water 
pollution and salt attacking historic remains

lanny bell director of chicago house a special arm of the 
university of chicagos oriental institute has wrestled for 11 
years with how to save decaying monuments in southern egypts luxor 
area the greatest concentration of monuments on earth 
using photography and hand drawings chicago house is recording 
some of egypts bestknown monuments before they disappear 
in many respects the modern egyptians live in a huge outdoor 
museum and museums are to be visited bell said the question 
remains one of finding the best way to display an artifact even an 
artifact as large as a temple to best advantage 
most egyptian monuments were built as places of worship with 
restricted entry bell said the dilemma for antiquities officials is 
keeping monuments in their natural settings while insulating them 
against tourist hordes 
tourism is both necessary and desirable he said but if 
the present rate of decay continues as it has for 100 years there 
will be no need for tourists 200 years from now to visit luxor for 
its monuments 
zahi hawass who controls giza plateau egypts bestknown 
tourist area is trying to make it safer both for tourists and its 
monuments the giza pyramids and the sphinx he hopes television 
monitors being installed inside the pyramids can stop tourist antics 
that began 1100 years ago when treasure hunters forced their way 
into cheops pyramid 
for the past 100 years this place has been a zoo and for the 
past 50 years antiquities authorities have had no plans to protect 
the monuments from tourists hawass said our biggest problem in 
egypt is we have no concept that a monument should be a national 
park where people come to enjoy but behave 
tourism has become egypts second largest earner of foreign 
currency with almost 2 million visitors in 1988 spending more than 
2 billion the tourism promotion boards moussa wants to double the 
number within a few years 
moussa said officials recognize the appeal of egypts monuments 
but must look beyond history to encourage mass tourism 
if youre thinking of coming to egypt only for its monuments 
you can always put it off because the monuments will still be 
here he said 
our best bet to help both tourism and monuments is to provide a 
number of alternative sites throughout the country drawing tourists 
away from congested monuments we also can help find ways to stem 
the tourist flow into popular sites 
tourism officials and the world bank have devised a plan they say 
will ease congestion in the temples and tombs on luxors west bank 
it includes new roads and a visitors center that will control 
visits to the main attractions by computer 
two of the most famous tombs in the valley of the kings seti i 
and tutankhamun are endangered but remain open to the public 
a year ago the frail tomb of seti i was reopened after 
restoration a few weeks later a zodiac design painted on its 
ceiling unique among egyptian monuments came crashing to the floor 
workers are restoring the zodiac behind a rope barrier because 
every time we close seti we get objections from tourist 
agencies said upper egyptian antiquities director balboush 
in king tuts tomb visited every day of the tourist season by 
2500 and more scientists found in november that bacteria were 
eating away the colorful wall paintings 
to accommodate tourist traffic plans were made for restorers to 
apply an antidote to the infested walls before and after hours once 
they saw how serious the infestation was however experts decided 
to work nonstop for three days 
tourists didnt hamper the work the antidote smelled so foul 
that once visitors took a whiff they rushed out leaving restorers 
to their work

the devastating armenian earthquake posed 
important tasks for the soviet regime can it cope with destruction 
on such a wide scale does it lack the means to mitigate suffering 
does it have to rely on foreign help to save lives does its 
entrenched bureaucracy make things worse here is a report by an 
associated press correspondent who spent much time in the quake area 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the soviet response to armenias devastating 
earthquake offered a rare look at the kremlins ability to respond 
to crisis and revealed logistical and technical weaknesses that 
observers say cost many of the estimated 55000 lives that were lost 
the countrys staterun media freer under president mikhail s 
gorbachevs policy of glasnost pounced on the story and provided 
extraordinary coverage to the soviet people and the world but the 
tragedy only temporarily stalled the bitter territorial dispute 
between armenia and azerbaijan 
within hours of the dec 7 quake the kremlin used its military 
and centralized state control to throw doctors and basic aid into 
the battle to save lives but the civil defense system hampered by 
a lack of local leadership transportation bottlenecks and 
organizational problems bogged down 
and the rescue effort underlined a shortage of technology and an 
inability to shift to sophisticated techniques for finding and 
treating victims 
it is unclear however whether any other country faced with a 
comparable challenge with devastation spread over a wide and remote 
geographical area would have fared better in what foreign relief 
experts uniformly described as the worst quake they had seen 
the kremlin formed a pair of highlevel commissions one led by 
premier nikolai i ryzhkov that arrived in armenia less than 24 
hours after the quake 
health minister yevgeny chazov said most hospitals were destroyed 
and 70 percent of all local doctors and medical workers were killed 
but military and civilian doctors rushed to the scene conducted 
2500 operations in field conditions and in the open air during the 
first 24 hours 
the soviet military organized an emergency food supply that held 
up well and kept the damaged cities under guard to ensure order 
the effort began breaking down because of an absence of 
leadership on the local level the link most weakened by long years 
of the central control gorbachev is trying to change with his 
reforms 
un disaster relief officer sverre kilde visiting the shattered 
city of leninakan four days after the earthquake said the relief 
effort until you reach the spot here has been very good but here on 
the spot there is no control 
julia taft the head of the us foreign disaster assistance 
office said when her group arrived sunday no one directed it to a 
specific location the americans were told to go wherever they 
wanted to work 
survivors were picking through the crushed buildings with hand 
tools and pleading for more cranes and heavy equipment if the 
equipment had come on time we could have saved many more people 
said manuel zalyan 
zalyan was searching a fivestory apartment building while a 
yellow crane sent the day before deemed by rescuers too small to be 
of any use sat silently on the adjacent street 
ryzhkov ackowledged to reporters that officials were disappointed 
with the lack of organization 
on dec 12 the fifth day after the quake he said there finally 
was enough equipment and material help and that the entire effort 
was proceeding not badly 
but then the weather turned rainy and cold in the remote area 
near turkey in the foothills of the caucasus mountains compounding 
problems with earthquake damage to rails and roads and the 
overcrowding of local airports with relief flights 
fog turned a confused situation at the yerevan airport into 
chaos airlifted supplies were reported to be piling up in spitak a 
city almost totally destroyed by the quake and ms taft reported a 
shortage of cars and trucks to ferry supplies overland 
by that time the rescue and medical needs had become more 
sophisticated and the soviet union could not keep up without foreign 
help european and american teams with trained dogs and special gear 
were brought in to search the rubble for survivors 
the weekly newspaper moscow news carped that the chernobyl 
nuclear power accident and a pair of serious railroad accidents 
should have proved long ago the need for a soviet emergency rescue 
force 
it thanked the foreigners for their help but added we cannot 
reconcile ourselves to the fact that our professionals did not 
arrive on the scene of the disaster before them 
more than 10000 soldiers were stationed in leninakan but they 
were assigned to unloading aid shipments at the airport guarding 
roads and distributing food the search for survivors was left 
largely to those whose homes had collapsed and to the foreign rescue 
crews 
chazov said the centralized system allowed the soviet union to 
mobilize thousands of medical workers from across the country on 
short notice we are very critical of our public health system 
but i think the period we lived through proved its effectiveness 
he told a moscow news conference 
however he also agreed that a special emergency rescue force was 
needed 
in a country that in the past has pointed to a large number of 
doctors and hospitals as proof of the quality of health care 
officials quickly declared that enough medical personnel were on the 
scene of the disaster 
but just as soviet medical equipment is often less sophisticated 
than that available in the west or simply unavailable the soviets 
this time had to look abroad for important equipment to face medical 
emergencies 
they sent out an urgent plea for dialysis machines to combat the 
effects of crush syndrome a poisoning of the blood by toxics 
released by muscles subjected to heavy pressure for long periods of 
time chazov said about 500 people were suffering from that 
condition

a lack of preparation also showed in the shoddy construction of 
apartment houses that crumbled on their residents and worsened the 
tragedy even though leninakan spitak and other northwestern 
armenian cities are in an earthquake zone the same kinds of 
prefabricated apartments were built there as in other parts of the 
soviet union in the past 20 years 
in leninakan the buildings that fell were largely five or 
ninestory apartment houses that had been built in the last two 
decades a period of chronically poor housing construction caused by 
the soviet unions hurry to build enough apartments to end a chronic 
housing shortage older lower buildings were damaged but generally 
stayed up 
mayor emil kirokasyan of leninakan told reporters the new 
buildings were not constructed to withstand the shock of the 
earthquake ryzhkov cited many violations in the construction 
and pledged the city would be rebuilt with lower sturdier 
structures 
the buildings crumbled into such small pieces that there were few 
air pockets in which people could survive until rescued ms taft 
said many blocks were heaps of rubble with no air spaces she 
said 
gorbachev rushed home from new york where he had addressed the 
united nations and made a highly publicized trip to armenia he 
pledged to investigate the poor housing construction 
in the spirit of glasnost gorbachevs policy of greater 
openness the official media reported critical comments by armenians 
about a lack of equipment for the rescue effort 
the nightly news program vremya expanded to present lengthy 
reports from the disaster area and national newspapers filled their 
front and back pages with reports and dramatic pictures of the 
rescue efforts pravda the communist party newspaper which normally 
prints pictures of smiling workers or official meetings on its front 
page printed a photograph of a destroyed building under the 
headline our pain and tragedy 
ryzhkov contrasted the outpouring of sympathy and aid from abroad 
with the suspicious and critical attitude toward the soviet union 
after the april 1986 chernobyl accident 
the premier said we never before have seen from foreign 
countries such warm human empathy attributing it to gorbachevs 
foreign policy that he declared had eased world tension 
but the soviet willingness to publicly come to grips with the 
natural disaster also likely played a part in world response the 
soviet union tried to hide the chernobyl accident from the world for 
several days but it reported the earthquake promptly and fully 
the freer atmosphere gorbachev has fostered inside the soviet 
union also meant that this time it was not the response of people of 
foreign nationalities that concerned the kremlin so much as the 
reaction of the ethnic groups closest to the disaster 
armenians and neighboring azerbaijanis have been at odds since 
february over control of the nagornokarabakh region of azerbaijan 
armenians encouraged by the freer atmosphere gorbachev has 
encouraged had demanded annexation of the region which is 
predominantly ethnic armenian 
but the dispute has turned violent and in the three weeks prior 
to the earthquake 31 people died in attacks of one group upon the 
other more than 180000 people fled across the border between the 
two republics 
chazov said armenian patients were not sent to azerbaijani 
hospitals and that azerbaijani doctors were not sent to armenia to 
treat earthquake victims 
gorbachev asked on television about the dispute angrily said 
that provocateurs were trying to use the quake to create 
instability and rejected claims by armenian activists that the 
removal of orphans from the earthquake area was an effort to 
russify it 
what kind of morals do these people have gorbachev demanded 
they dont need karabakh they are waging a battle for power and 
they must be stopped

retailers cash registers are beeping and ringing 
their way through the christmas season but many shoppers are buying 
cheaper gifts than in the past 
industry observers find that consumers with changing lifestyles 
are allocating more money for their homes and less for the things 
they dont really need that means less expensive christmas gifts 
fewer apparel purchases and on a much broader scale some big 
changes in the retail industry in the next few years 
its all because of shifts in the demographic makeup of this 
country the baby boom generation that is entering or well into 
middle age has different interests and needs than it did just a few 
years ago 
monroe greenstein a retail industry analyst with the investment 
firm bear stearns amp co inc said recently the apparel industrys 
yearlong sales slump which appears to be at an end was due in 
part to the changes in consumer spending it was also caused by 
womens rejection of the fashions over the past few seasons 
your priorities change greenstein said youre concerned 
less with apparel and more with what goes into your home 
stacy ruclamer of shearson lehman hutton inc agreed with that 
hypothesis in a recent analysis ms ruclamer said the sluggishness 
in overall retail spending that has persisted since february 1987 
was partly attributable to the fact that while the trendsetting 
teenage population was declining the maturing baby boomers were 
forming households and shifting their buying patterns to many 
homerelated products 
some retailers have reported brisk business this holiday season 
in whats known as lowticket items such as sweaters and 
accessories the biggest sellers at bloomingdales in new york 
include 25 watches 64 calvin klein sweaters and 40 bathrobes 
and the store says its done landmark business in handbags belts 
and scarves 
k mart corp the nations largest retailer has also reported 
less expensive gifts are the most popular this season 
overall the christmas season appears to be going well 
i think its decent so far said jeffrey edelman an analyst 
with drexel burnham lambert inc i think most stores are close to 
plan although the numbers are not that robust 
apparel retailers who were slashing prices a year ago at the 
height of their slump are doing very well said fred wintzer 
an analyst with alex brown amp sons theyre doing a lot better than 
i thought they would 
analysts believe stores will benefit from shifts in the calendar 
that add two days to the shopping season this year 
and said wintzer theyre all going to get a big sales 
increase that last week before christmas 
retailers and the analysts who track them had lowered 
expectations going into the christmas shopping season because of the 
continuing sluggishness in the industry 
consumers have been spending less in stores because of the higher 
cost of services such as medical care and college tuition and on 
their cars and on food and theyve been trying to pay down high 
installment debt 
but the analysts nonetheless expect some retailers to benefit 
from the demographic changes 
walter loeb of morgan stanley amp co inc predicted the 
emphasis for specialty stores in the next decade will change from 
apparel fashions to home furnishings 
that means retailers like home depot and builders square which 
specialize in home improvement items like paint paneling and 
hardware will be in greater demand loeb said so will stores like 
conrans and pier 1 imports which feature home furnishings he said 
other retailers like k mart have recognized the trend and are 
promoting their homefurnishing or homeimprovement segments loeb 
said 
the analysts expect to see some leveling off in apparel 
retailing although as loeb noted fashion specialists and 
department stores with a specific point of view will continue to do 
well in the 1990s

despite an abundance of obstacles many wall 
street analysts still hold out hope that economic growth can 
continue at a respectable pace in 1989 
their view is by no means unanimous the list of worries and 
uncertainties in most forecasts as yearend approaches is long and 
familiar credittightening by the federal reserve the budget and 
trade deficits buyout debt troubled savings institutions and more 
still economists at first boston corp argue further 
improvement in the foreign trade deficit continuation of the 
capital goods boom and needed inventory restocking should keep the 
economy rolling through the first half of 1989 
when the economy has stopped growing and slipped into a recession 
in the past first boston observed the fed has usually been 
pursuing an emphatic effort to tighten credit in order to restrain 
inflation 
now the firm argues the prospect is for only skirmishes 
against inflation which will be insufficient to halt growth 
thus a recession is not probable in the foreseeable future in 
1990 the economy may even reaccelerate 
beyond economic circumstances some observers say the political 
cycle makes the timing ripe for a business slowdown if not a 
recession 
under this reasoning a new occupant of the white house such as 
presidentelect george bush faces up to hard choices quickly at the 
beginning of his term when action is most possible and the 
temporary pain that often results has time to dissipate before the 
next election 
of the last 11 recessions nine have begun during the first 
year of a presidents term acknowledges richard sichel director 
of research in the trust and investment services group at first 
pennsylvania bank 
it may take less bitter medicine this time to correct our 
ailments however investors should emphasize quality predictable 
earnings growth and reasonable valuation sichel said 
investors were indeed playing it cautious in the stock market 
this past week showing little inclination either to buy or to head 
for the exits the dow jones average of 30 industrials edged up 722 
to 215071 
the new york stock exchange composite index fell 43 to 15516 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market rose 60 
to 37580 and the american stock exchange market value index was 
down 24 at 29737 
volume on the big board averaged 14443 million shares a day 
against 14186 million the week before 
the sheer length of the current period of economic expansion 
which began in late 1982 is often mentioned as another cause for 
pause in assessing the outlook 
there is no magic number of months or years beyond which the 
economy cannot keep growing analysts say 
but some who are skeptical about chances for robust growth in 
1989 say the expansion of the past six years is showing signs of 
having extended itself close to limits of capacity 
signs have emerged that growth although currently strong is 
about to slow sharply contends donald straszheim chief economist 
at merrill lynch 
at best the economy could manage a soft landing with sluggish 
but positive growth next year at worst a downturn could develop 
before the end of 1989 but it need not be severe 
we tend to expect a downturn straszheim concluded whatever 
else that would mean for the business and investment outlook he 
added it would have the positive side effect of leading to a 
sharp decline in interest rates

lorimar telepictures inc says its agreement to 
sell its puerto rican television broadcast interests has cleared the 
way for the entertainment companys longstalled sale to warner 
communications inc 
lorimars interest in the two stations as well as its ownership 
of a third station in pittsburgh had been a stumbling block for 
warners proposed acquisitions of the culver city califbased 
company in an exchange of stock and debt that has been valued at 
about 12 billion 
lorimar has previously announced plans to sell the pittsburgh 
station wpgh in a deal that is expected to be completed in january 
on thursday it said it expects to complete the sale of its 
interest in the two puerto rican stations wsurtv and wliitv 
before the end of the year 
the buyer was identified as an investor group led by timothy 
brumlik of orlando fla who was said to have other television 
interests serving the hispanic market in central florida terms of 
the sale were not disclosed 
as a result of both deals lorimar said that its merger with 
warner is expected to be consummated in january 1989 
lorimar is a leading supplier of television programming including 
such popular shows as dallas knots landing and alf 
warner a records film and publishing company based in new york 
proposed in may to acquire lorimar which has lost millions of 
dollars in recent quarters in an exchange of stock 
but warners biggest shareholder chriscraft industries inc 
objected to the deal saying it would violate a 1984 agreement it 
signed with warner when the two companies bought stakes in each 
other 
chriscraft a new yorkbased media company bought its stake in 
warner and gave warner in return a 425 percent in its bhc inc 
subsidiary which operates a halfdozen television stations 
under the terms of the agreement however warner was prevented 
from owning other television stations as long as it owns 25 percent 
or more of bhc 
chriscraft sued warner over the lorimar deal last summer in new 
york state supreme court 
warner proposed putting the lorimar television stations in a 
trust until they could be sold but the court blocked the merger 
until either warner reduced its stake in bhc below 25 percent or 
lorimar sold the stations 
warner appealed the decision but the lower courts ruling was 
affirmed by the appellate division of the new york state supreme 
court earlier this week 
in a statement chriscraft said hopefully todays 
announcement signals that warner has finally decided to live up to 
its agreement with us 
lorimar announced in august that it had agreed to sell the 
pittsburgh station to renaissance communications the sale is being 
reviewed by the federal communications commission and lorimar 
expects approval by midjanuary 
but a lorimar spokeswoman speaking on condition that she not be 
identified by name said the sale of lorimars interests in the 
puerto rican stations is different because lorimar placed its 
interest in the stations in a trust and is selling that rather than 
the stations themselves 
as a result she said lorimar can shed its interest in those 
stations without waiting for fcc approval 
in trading thursday on the new york stock exchange warner was 
unchanged at 3537 a share lorimar rose 12 cents a share to 12 
in trading on the american stock exchange

robert a rough who has long denied leaking 
confidential interest rate data while on the new york federal 
reserve banks board has formally entered an innocent plea to 
insider trading charges 
rough was arraigned thursday before us district judge dickinson 
r debevoise one week after his indictment by a federal grand jury 
in newark 
rough is accused of disclosing information on the discount rate 
set by the federal reserve bank in washington to principals at 
bevill bresler amp schulman inc a brokerage firm based in 
livingston nj that later suffered a 144 million collapse 
the government said bevill bresler made millions of dollars and 
avoided millions in losses because of the information which rough 
allegedly exchanged for 47000 in interestfree loans 
roughs attorney michael himmel said he would need time to 
review thousands of transactions by the firm which collapsed in 
april 1985 
debevoise on thursday set roughs bail at a 150000 personal 
recognizance bond and limited his travel to new york new jersey 
pennsylvania michigan florida and washington dc 
a hearing on pretrial motions was set for feb 14 and trial was 
scheduled for feb 21 
after the hearing himmel and the affablelooking rough declined 
to comment 
the indictment said that while rough was president of the 
national bank of sussex county in branchville nj and sat on the 
new york feds board from 1982 to 1984 he regularly leaked advance 
word on the local federal reserves discount rate recommendation to 
the national fed as well as the feds final determination on the 
rate 
the discount rate has a powerful effect on the securities market 
and has been called by fed officials one of their most closely 
guarded secrets the rate is the interest the fed charges on loans 
to financial institutions and is regarded as an indicator of the 
direction in which the fed is seeking to push interest rates which 
affect the prices of bonds 
after the fed learned of the allegations against rough which 
were first mentioned in april 1987 during testimony at a criminal 
trial stemming from the bevill bresler collapse the bank tightened 
procedures for the rate rough publicly denied the charges at the 
time of the trial repeating denials to investigators in private 
interviews 
rough a former chairman of the new jersey bankers association 
was formally charged with conspiracy to commit wire and securities 
fraud two counts of bank fraud one count each of wire fraud and 
securities fraud and two counts of making false statements to banks 
authorities have called it the first case of insider trading 
involving government securities and the federal reserve system 
rough resigned from sussex national earlier this year 
prosecutors said

platinum prices should continue dropping sharply 
for the next few days in the wake of ford motor cos announcement 
of a program to equip some cars with pollution controls that dont 
use the precious metal an analyst says 
platinum prices plunged on the new york mercantile exchange 
thursday a day after ford chairman donald petersen announced in 
pittsburgh a pilot program using catalytic converters without 
platinum 
ford has released few details of the new converter which is to 
be used in 1989 ford thunderbird and mercury cougar cars sold in 
california a state with the toughest air quality standards in the 
nation 
more than 75 percent of the platinum used in the united states is 
in converters which remove some pollutants from automobile exhaust 
gases petersen made the announcement wednesday night and that sent 
thursdays platinum prices tumbling 
platinum futures contracts for current delivery closed thursday 
at 57960 a troy ounce at the new york exchange down 2490 an 
ounce from wednesdays 60450 close the heavily traded contract 
for january delivery dropped the daily limit of 25 
earlier thursday the spot contract price which is not subject 
to the 25 limit fell more than 60 an ounce before rebounding 
prior to the close of trading 
this is actually a collapse precious metals analyst james 
steel of refco inc in new york said he said the decline came 
solely because of fords announcement 
in fact it took everybody by surprise he said if you 
asked any analyst fundamentally they were bullish on platinum it 
looks like the futures are going to lock in at limitdown the 25 
maximum loss for the next few days at least 
metals analyst bette raptopoulos of prudentialbache securities 
inc agreed 
it is a very bearish indicator for platinum she said 
there may be other issues as we go on its also brought downside 
pressure on the other precious metals 
steel said the waves should be felt in europe too where 
platinum futures were being bought on expectations of increased used 
of catalytic converters there 
its doublebearish now because we had put in our forecast for 
89 that we were relying on the europeans to buy more platinum he 
said 
ford spokesman bill peacock declined comment on the reaction of 
the commodity market to the companys announcement and declined to 
detail any of the specifications of the new converter 
he and petersen said the device could save the company a 
substantial amount of money but peacock did not say if any of the 
savings would be passed on to consumers if the device proves 
successful 
he said the device would be installed in 40000 to 50000 
thunderbirds and cougars both made at a ford plant in lorain ohio 
bill sessa a spokesman for the california air resources board 
confirmed that the cars have been certified to be sold in the state 
auto industry analyst ron glantz of montgomery securities inc of 
san francisco said current catalytic converters use about 10 worth 
of platinum each leading him to suggest that cost savings must come 
from other areas such as the cost of applying the platinum in the 
converter 
a catalytic converter is attached to the exhaust system of an 
engine exhaust gases pass through it and react with a catalyst 
platinum in the current device to remove pollutants and produce 
harmless materials 
peacock said the new device creates no materials other than the 
water and carbon dioxide produced by todays converters 
he declined to speculate on when the new converter could be put 
into fords full manufacturing process if the pilot program is 
successful he said however it would not be during the current 
1989 model year which ends next sept 30 
we dont want to be pinned down on a timetable he said it 
is a very attractive opportunity because it yields quality and cost 
advantages

first interstate bancorp has decided to sell 
off hundreds of millions of dollars in bad loans and unprofitable 
real estate rather than spin them off into a separate bad bank 
first interstate had planned to form a separate company the 
bad bank to handle 400 million in bad loans and unprofitable 
real estate 
but the company said thursday it had changed its mind based on a 
reassessment that put the value of the nonperforming assets at 
225 million to 250 million rather than the original 400 million 
the smaller pool of bad loans and real estate would be better 
disposed of through sale the company said additionally because 
the amount to be spun off was smaller than originally expected tax 
benefits of the deal werent as great as planned it said 
the original plan would have given first interstate shareholders 
stock in two companies a bigger more profitable good bank 
shorn of underperforming assets and the smaller bad bank 
the change in plan means the bad assets wont be shed by the end 
of the first quarter of 1989 as originally thought 
the asset sales will leave first interstate with 150 million 
more in common equity than would have been the case under the 
spinoff the bank said 
the plan was part of a restructuring scheme announced in october 
1987 to get out of lines of business outside those where the bank 
has done best mainly consumer and middlemarket banking in the west 
first interstate which has more than 1000 banks in 21 states 
is the nations ninthlargest bank holding company

wholesale prices that were flat in october 
after three months of fairly large increases are on the rise again 
but not at a dangerously inflationary pace according to economists 
with the labor departments producer price index figures for 
november due out today the consensus among private analysts was 
that wholesale prices rose a modest 03 percent last month 
inflationary fears exceed inflationary reality at the present 
time said donald ratajczak director of economic forecasting at 
georgia state university in atlanta 
any increase higher than 03 percent would aggravate inflation 
fears triggered by reports earlier this week that factories mines 
and power plants operated at a nineyear high of 842 percent of 
their capacity in october with industrial production up another half 
of a percentage point in november 
wholesale price inflation had slowed to zero in october as food 
prices that had been rising at an annual rate of 8 percent because 
of the summer drought decreased 
stable food prices or even another slight decline after seasonal 
adjustments showed up in november in private surveys as large hog 
slaughters continued to put downward pressure on pork prices 
beef prices were up sharply as were costs for vegetables as they 
became seasonally scarce but those factors were built into the 
seasonal adjustments that the government uses 
ratajczak said the big propellants of the november price 
increases were a firming in oil prices even prior to the 
establishment of new production quotas last month by the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries 
he said his own survey showed wholesale gasoline prices rising 2 
percent in november and home heat oil spurting up by 6 percent 
however natural gas prices stabilized after surging by nearly 5 
percent in october 
oil prices probably will end this year slightly higher than 
originally expected because of response to the latest opec 
agreement ratajczak said however oil prices are expected to 
again decline next spring this also moderates price gains for 
chemicals and plastics 
ratajcak said he expects that for 1988 in total wholesale prices 
will have risen 37 percent compared with 22 percent for last 
year for 1989 he is predicting wholesale price inflation of 42 
percent with beef and pork costs soaring in the second wave of 
aftershocks from last summers drought 
when the opec agreement becomes unmanagable next spring and oil 
prices decline once again commodity inflation should remain 
restrained he said in the increasing concern about inflation 
many have failed to note that industrial commodity prices have 
increased less in 1988 than in 1987

three former salesmen for a failed commodities 
trading firm have pleaded guilty to charges they participated in a 
scheme to defraud investors of 32 million 
carl h bertrams 32 richard k shelhamer 39 and george y 
ayling 37 each pleaded guilty thursday to two counts of mail fraud 
and agreed to cooperate in a continuing investigation of first 
commodities corp of boston 
the three entered their pleas before us district judge nicholas 
bua they each face a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a 
2000 fine 
assistant us attorney michele smith said she expected a grand 
jury to soon indict several managers and salesmen who worked in 
first commodities offices in chicago and suburban oak brook between 
1983 and 1987 
in their guilty pleas the defendants said they sold commodity 
investments over the telephone by following a set script that 
downplayed risk and exaggerated profit potential 
while salesmen stressed the urgency of making an investment 
before an impending price increase new clients who sent in personal 
checks had their funds stored temporarily in spread positions that 
limited the risk to first boston should the checks bounce 
the brokerages salesmen often favored selling silver contracts 
because of the metals glamorous image but also sold 
agricultural and financial futures especially when the season or a 
news event would bring a certain product to the publics attention 
the pleas said 
according to the pleas the men lied extensively about their 
expertise and poor track records as well as the size and growth of 
first boston 
founded in the late 1970s by don r schleicher and his brother 
richard the firm rapidly grew into one of the nations leading 
futures trading firms generating 40 million annually in sales from 
offices in denver nevada and california 
in 1987 the firm collapsed beneath a mountain of investor 
lawsuits and investigations by the fbi and other agencies

share prices were higher near the days peak at 
midday friday on british economic figures which have buoyed the 
markets mood 
dealers said share prices continued to advance on the growing 
belief that the british government wont have to increase interest 
rates further to slow down inflationary pressures on the british 
economy 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index was up 93 
points or 05 percent at 17725 at about 1245 pm near the 
morning peak of 99 points up 
volume was a moderate 2358 million shares compared with 2287 
million shares at the same time thursday 
dealers said the market has been gradually shaking off its 
previous concerns about the effects of high interest rates on 
british corporate profitability until recently many analysts 
thought the government would have to push base lending rates above 
the current 13 percent level to slow down the british economy and 
choke off inflation 
but recent economic figures especially average earnings figures 
released thursday and retail sales figures published last monday 
have suggested the economy is already responding to higher rates 
on friday the government reported that the annual rate of 
inflation held steady at 64 percent in november

britains annual inflation rate held steady at 64 
percent in november the government said friday in the latest in a 
series of economic reports which have somewhat eased concerns about 
resurgent inflation 
however retail prices rose 05 percent in november from the 
previous month the department of employment said and employment 
secretary norman fowler said there can be no grounds for 
complacency 
fighting inflation remains a clear priority the secretary 
said 
the government has pushed up interest rates to 13 percent from a 
decade low of 75 percent in june to discourage consumer spending 
and choke off inflation which has increased from a 33 percent 
annual rate in january 
in october the retail price index rose 1 percent from the 
previous month and was up 64 percent from a year earlier 
market expectations had been for an annual inflation rate of 
between 63 percent and 65 percent in november 
the department said that the rise between october and november 
mainly reflects increases in mortgage interest rates as well as 
higher prices for some foods clothing and footwear excluding 
mortgage interest payments retail prices rose by 51 percent on 
average in the year to november the department said 
the index which uses a january 1987 base of 100 stood at 1100 
in november up from 1095 in october and from in 1034 november 
1987 
fowler noted thursdays news that the underlying annual rate of 
increase in earnings fell to 9 percent in october from 925 percent 
in september but said the growth of earnings still remains too high 
moderation in pay settlements remains essential for the economy 
and for jobs he said 
on monday the government reported that retail sales fell 05 
percent in november

the past year has provided plenty of support for 
those pundits who argue that corporate earnings dont matter much to 
the stock market 
when all the results are in standard amp poors corp estimates 
corporate earnings for 1988 will be up as much as 40 percent from 
last year on top of a 21 percent increase in 1987 
yet sampps 500stock composite index showed a gain for the year of 
only about 115 percent as of middecember 
the numbers also reflect badly on the image of the market as a 
mechanism that anticipates or discounts in wall street 
parlance trends in corporate earnings six months to a year in the 
future 
the markets crash in 1987 and the meager increase it posted for 
the year as a whole hardly appear to have been accurate foretokens 
of where earnings were headed in 1988 
and these days of course the market seems to swoon every time 
it is confronted with evidence that the economy remains strong and 
is supporting continued growth in profits 
will all that however some analysts say the sharp increases in 
earnings this year have done the market a lot of good 
when the priceearnings ratio of the sampp 500 soared over 20 to 1 
in the summer of 1987 they say it reached dangerously overvalued 
levels and had to come down one way or another 
the first part of that reduction to about 15 to 1 was achieved 
by a drastic drop in stock prices in the fall of last year 
since then by contrast the market pe has been lowered further 
in a far more constructive way through earnings increases rather 
than reductions in stock prices 
the sampp 500 lately has traded at just under 12 times the last 12 
months earnings reported by the stocks that make up the index 
analysts at the firms weekly publication the outlook say the 
multiple is barely more than 10 if you calculate it on the basis of 
their earnings projections for 1989 it hasnt been that low since 
1984 
there is nothing to prevent the market pe from falling even 
further indeed it spent more than five years below 10 in the late 
1970s and early 1980s 
however many marketwatchers argue at its current levels the pe 
indicates that stocks arent puffed up by overly optimistic 
expectations 
last years crash was triggered by fundamental overvaluation of 
stocks says norman fosback in the fort lauderdale flabased 
investment advisory letter market logic 
although price levels are the same now as they were in early 
1987 underlying fundamentals have improved substantially 
earnings and dividends have grown and continue to grow and at 
current levels will readily support substantially higher prices than 
prevail today 
given the present reasonable valuation levels moderate 
monetary policies and modest economic growth there is no reason why 
the stock market cannot continue to advance not only over the 
course of 1989 but into the 1990s 
sampps analysts arent so sanguine about the markets 1989 
prospects they predict a bumpy market that may end the year 5 
percent to 10 percent below its recent levels 
but looking at pe ratios they also observe stock valuations 
are generally reasonable thus longterm investors shouldnt 
hesitate to accumulate stocks of companies with good earnings 
visibility and strong balance sheets 
maybe its hard to see any yearbyyear correlation between 
trends in stock prices and earnings analysts like these contend 
but over the long haul rising earnings count for a lot

dispute monday at a regularly scheduled meeting in brussels 
according to a spokeswoman for the 12nation trading bloc 
the community wants to ban for health reasons all meat from 
animals treated with growth hormones late last year it agreed to 
delay implementation of the prohibition until jan 1 
an estimated 170 million of us meat exports would be affected 
by the ban 
the united states has threatened to take retaliatory action if 
the prohibiton is imposed by slapping duties on a variety of 
products imported from the trading bloc the united states argues 
that the use of certain hormones to fatten animals a common 
practice among american farmers is not a health risk 
the eec has in turn promised to retaliate if any extra duties 
are imposed on its products 
a spokeswoman for the trading bloc who requested anonymity said 
the eec has drawn up a draft plan that would single out for 
retaliation four american products natural honey unshelled nuts 
dried fruit and canned corn exported to the community 
she did not specify what sort of restrictions would be placed on 
those products only that such action would depend on the us 
response other products could also be added to the list she said 
discussions were continuing to try to resolve the dispute 
officials from both sides also were expected to discuss the issue 
tuesday when they gather in geneva for a meeting of the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade the 96nation world trade

usair has appealed to the national mediation 
board for a recount of an election in which the teamsters narrowly 
claimed victory to represent 3700 fleet service workers in 100 us 
cities 
the airline also asked the board to reconsider an earlier 
decision that prevented voting by a number of other employees 
presumed to support management against the union 
the twomember mediation board was to receive the airlines 
request today in washington dc but might not act immediately 
said board spokesman charles barnes 
the mediation board credited the union with 1867 votes four 
more than the majority it needed to win 
william genoese director of the teamsters airline division 
called the recount request a frivolous and desperate attempt to 
cloud the issues and block certification 
had the union lost it would have been forced to withdraw as 
bargaining agent for 2000 fleet service workers it had been 
representing in pittsburgh philadelphia buffalo and boston 
we were expecting more but a win is a win is a win said 
vince hickman business representative for teamsters local 732 at 
greater pittsburgh international airport 
contract talks have been stalled for more than a year 
were very up genoese said were ready to sit down and 
negotiate

mediated contract talks between northwest 
airlines and the union representing the carriers 4800 pilots will 
begin in earnest jan 4 a company spokesman said friday 
northwest officials and leaders of the air line pilots 
association met in separate and joint meetings this week with 
federal mediator robert brown said alan muncaster a spokesman for 
northwest 
the meetings were designed to provide brown with background on 
the labor dispute muncaster said 
the parties agreed thursday to adjourn and begin a full round of 
joint talks jan 4 muncaster said 
the pilots and the airline were millions of dollars apart when 
northwest requested mediation in midnovember the call for 
mediation temporarily ended the unions strike threat the pilots 
voted overwhelmingly to walk off their jobs but said they would 
abide by laws that make a strike illegal during mediation 
one of the sticking points in the negotiations is how to merge 
the seniority rights of pilots in the aftermath of the 1986 
acquisition of republic airlines pilots from the two carriers had 
been working under separate contracts until they expired

a manhattan federal grand jury investigating 
takeover investor and singer co chairman paul bilzerian is expected 
to indict him on two securities fraud charges the wall street 
journal reported friday 
quoting unidentified people it said were familiar with the 
investigation the newspaper said the charges could come as early as 
next week and will focus on at least two takeover situations in 
which bilzerian was involved concerning hh robertson co and 
hammermill paper co 
the journal said one of the impending charges evidently stems 
from disclosures by boyd l jefferies a los angeles broker who 
turned states evidence in march 1987 after he was implicated in 
securities violations by ivan f boesky the infamous insider trader 
now serving a threeyear prison term 
the other charge was said to concern allegedly false disclosures 
bilzerian made to the securities and exchange commission regarding a 
source of money to be used to buy securities 
bilzerian a onetime real estate investor with residences in 
florida and california has been one of the most active investors in 
takeover targets he won control of singer co for 106 billion 
after a lengthy fight with the defense contractors management and 
is currently chairman of that company 
bruce baird the manhattan assistant us attorney for securities 
and commodities fraud declined to comment on the journal story 
neither bilzerian nor his lawyer arthur f mathews returned 
telephone calls for comment and jefferies lawyer kevin t rover 
declined to comment 
bilzerian reportedly has been under investigation for months 
regarding questionable trading activities the journal quoted people 
familiar with the probe as saying the indictments expected against 
bilzerian represent only a portion of matters involving him and more 
charges may be sought 
the investor made an unsuccessful run at hammermill paper two 
years ago but ultimately walked away with a big profit by pushing 
the erie pabased concern into a friendly merger with 
international paper co in 1985 he made a failed bid for 
pittsburghbased hh robertson a construction materials concern

a massachusetts company seeking to purchase 
universal foods corp has increased its cash tender offer to more 
than 600 million just one week after its initial takeover bid was 
rejected 
amanda acquisition corp a subsidiary of high voltage 
engineering corp of burlington mass had offered 3050 in cash 
for all of the outstanding shares of universal foods 
universal foods board of directors last week voted unanimously 
against the bid and said it reaffirmed its commitment to remain 
an independent company 
but amanda on thursday increased its offer to 35 a share 
clifford press deputy chairman of high voltage said the deal would 
amount to 6156 million for the 171 million outstanding shares 
it seems to us that you should be interested in exploring and 
universals shareholders are certainly entitled to decide for 
themselves whether the premium price that we are offering is fair 
and adequate in view of the companys past performance and future 
prospects press said in a letter to universals board 
paula c norton universals director of corporate 
communications confirmed receipt of the new offer late thursday 
we did receive the increased offer norton said management 
will take this offer to the board of directors which will meet in 
due course 
amanda began its acquisition bid dec 2 and its tender offer is 
scheduled to expire at midnight dec 30 unless otherwise extended 
we continue to believe that our acquisition can be achieved and 
we intend to consumate it press said we are also mindful that 
it is to everyones advantage that the acquisition be accomplished 
speedily without causing otherwide unavoidable disruptions and 
uncertainties to the companys business 
press said he hoped to encourage the board not to exercise a 
recently adopted poison pill provision aimed at blocking 
unwanted takeovers 
the poison bill gives the companys board and shareholders power 
to increase the price of a takeover by issuing a large amount of 
stock 
the price of universal stock rose 12 cents to 34125 per share 
at the close of trading thursday on the new york stock exchange

poultry farmers have gone from wringing their hands 
to wringing the necks of their birds as the public has lost its 
taste for eggs 
and the government which has stood by a minister who said most 
eggs are tainted by salmonella today began dishing out 925000 for 
newspaper ads saying there is very little risk to the public 
well labor party leader neil kinnock demanded in the house 
of commons on thursday which is it 
we are aware of the deep problems facing the egg industry 
said prime minister margaret thatcher 
however she said 1000 britishers have come down with 
salmonella this year because of bad eggs and the government has a 
duty to publicize the best medical advice 
the advertisements warn against using against uncooked eggs in 
such foods as homemade mayonnaise and yuletide eggnog firmly cooked 
eggs are prescribed for the sick elderly infants or pregnant women 
the ads say the incidence of salmonella is very small in a 
country that used to put away 200 million eggs a week about four 
per week per person 
the egg row has raged in parliament and the press since dec 3 
when health minister edwina currie said most of the countrys egg 
production is infected with salmonella 
consumption dropped 30 percent to 60 percent according to 
producers or 1015 percent according to supermarket chains 
conservative members of parliament from rural districts have 
joined opposition lawmakers in calling for mrs curries head 
in this case careless talk is costing jobs its causing 
bankruptcies and its caused hundreds of chickens in my constituency 
to be slaughtered this week david steel the former liberal party 
leader said in the commons thursday 
mrs currie quit today after conferring with mrs thatcher 
i think in all the circumstances it is the best course she 
said in a letter to mrs thatcher which was released to reporters 
mrs thatcher wrote accepting the resignation with great 
personal sadness 
with inventories growing producers announced wednesday that 1 
million eggs were being donated to armenian relief 
chris kirkwood who keeps 100000 chickens on his farm in 
rimswell in northern england said he has been killing 5000 hens a 
day and booked 20000 more for a slaughterhouse 
wringing the hens necks is very upsetting for the men 
kirkwood told the daily telegraph 
mrs thatcher felt obliged to reveal to the house of commons last 
week that she had eaten scrambled eggs on toast for lunch and i 
enjoyed it 
robert hicks a conservative lawmaker disclosed that he and mrs 
curries boss health secretary kenneth clarke often enjoyed a 
lunch of beer a cigar and two scotch eggs none of which our 
honorable friend seems to approve of 
love of scotch eggs a hardboiled egg wrapped in sausage 
breaded and deepfried was one of the things mrs currie 
apparently had in mind in september when she chided northerners for 
eating too much fat 
controversy ensued as it did when mrs currie advised pensioners 
to knit wool caps and sweaters if they couldnt afford heat or when 
she said that good christian people who wouldnt dream of 
misbehaving were at no risk of contracting aids

grumman corp plans to lay off about 10 
percent of its workforce or 3100 employees by the end of 1989 
including 2500 from its main operations in long island the 
military contractor announced today 
the layoffs will begin in early january with notices sent to 
1800 workers from various managerial and personnel departments 
said grumman spokesman bob harwood 
according to harwood the company will eliminate any unnecessary 
jobs not directly involved in production he said some production 
people will be affected but most of the layoffs will be in overhead 
and managerial positions 
we are going to eliminate jobs we grumman dont need in areas 
such as security personnel public relations business 
operations harwood said 
harwood said all layoffs within the past two years have been 
caused by declining defense spending which has increased pressures 
to cut costs 
for us to stay competitive we have to cut cost and cutting cost 
translates to cutting people he said 
our whole industry is facing flat or declining budgets said 
grumman chairman john obrien 
in the past two years grumman has been bumped from three major 
military aircraft contracts according to harwood in 1987 a 
contract to produce the navys advanced tactical aircraft was 
awarded to mcdonnell douglas and general dynamics in st louis 
grumman also was shut out from producing the air forces advanced 
tactical fighter 
during that time the company fired 1400 long island employees 
according to harwood the ata would eventually replace the a6e 
a navy bomber which is one of grummans mostproduced aircraft 
this year the government stopped development plans for an 
upgraded version bomber the a6g that plan would have generated 
1000 new engineer positions and brought in a quarterofa billion 
dollars annually 
out of the companys 32000 workers 21000 are employed on long 
island

popeyes famous fried chicken and biscuits must 
give five days notice if it decides to go ahead with efforts to take 
over churchs fried chicken before a court ruling on churchs 
pending appeal a federal court says 
the 5th us circuit court of appeal on thursday ordered new 
orleansbased popeyes not to buy churchs stock without notice until 
the jan 12 hearing on the san antoniobased companys fight against 
a takeover 
churchs has asked the 5th circuit to stop popeyes 290 million 
takeover bid claiming it is based on information misappropriated by 
two former churchs employees now working for popeyes 
ernest e renaud president of churchs called the ruling a 
victory for his company the no 2 fried chicken outlet in the 
country 
popeyes isnt going anywhere for the time being and i believe 
we have a good shot at winning on appeal because the case law is in 
churchs favor renaud said 
popeyes attorney peter butler said the ruling doesnt slow down 
the effort by popeyes owner al copeland to buy churchs stock with 
an 8dollarashare tender offer which expires tonight churchs 
board of directors is trying to find other buyers to fend off 
popeyes buyout offer which it has said is not enough 
were delighted butler said the ruling still allows us to 
disseminate our disclosures as ordered by the district court and 
get the clock moving toward having that injunction lifted 
u s district court judge charles schwartz refused to stop 
popeyes effort to take over churchs but ordered that it not proceed 
until 10 days after the company disclosed further information to the 
securities and exchange commission and churchs stockholders 
actually the action by the 5th circuit does nothing to set us 
back and we will be getting one primary obstacle lifted once the 
10day period is over and the district court injunction is lifted 
butler said

the government said friday it would allow kuwait up 
to three years to reduce its holding in british petroleum co plc to 
99 percent from 2168 percent 
the period represents a compromise between the five years sought 
by the kuwait investment office which is the londonbased 
investment arm of the kuwaiti government and the one year 
originally recommended by the british monopolies and mergers 
commission 
trade secretary lord young in october ordered kuwait to reduce 
its bp holding to 99 percent after the monopolies commission said a 
larger holding by kuwait might be expected to operate against the 
public interest 
the commission cited kuwaits role as a member of the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries 
the kuwaiti office was satisfied with the threeyear divestment 
period said john jeffrey of stephenson harwod the offices law 
firm the time span gives the office sufficient leeway to minimize 
its losses jeffrey said 
in recommending a oneyear divestment period the monopolies 
commission had said the timing of the sale should be subject to some 
flexibility in light of current stock market conditions 
the kuwait investment office built up its bp holding amounting 
to 1316 billion shares by purchasing partlypaid bp stock in the 
months following the british governments 132 billion public 
offering of bp shares in october 1987 which coincided with the 
stock market crash 
the offering which was far undersubscribed included the 
governments remaining 315 percent stake in bp plus 27 billion 
worth of new bp shares 
kuwait must sell around 700 million shares to reduce its holding 
to the required level 
analysts recently have speculated that bp might be planning to 
buy back the kuwaitiheld shares 
the speculation was prompted by bps confirmation this week that 
it is negotiating to sell most of its mineral assets to rtz corp 
analysts say the sale could be raise about 35 billion 
once the kuwaiti office has made the final payment on the partly 
paid shares next april the 700 million shares to be disposed of 
will be worth around 33 billion 
bp refused to comment on the timetable or on speculation about a 
share buyback 
bp shares closed up 2 pence about 4 cents at 259 pence or 
474 friday on the london stock exchange

the dollar rose friday against major currencies in 
europe as traders hedged their positions amid speculation of an 
imminent rise in us interest rates 
gold prices fell in nervous trading triggered by a slump in 
platinum prices 
the dollar ended the week higher against all key currencies 
compared with last fridays late levels 
dealers said the dollar moved up sharply in late trading partly 
because trading volume was relatively light 
the dollar began rising thursday following interest rate hikes in 
west germany and austria which fanned speculation that the us 
federal reserve might increase its discount rate the rate charged 
on loans to commercial banks 
but some analysts said the feds 65 percent discount rate would 
remain unchanged at least until the end of the year because of fears 
that an increase could disrupt stock markets in thin prechristmas 
trading 
traders said the bundesbank the west german central bank sold a 
small amount of dollars in morning trading but said the intervention 
had little impact on the dollars rise 
in tokyo the dollar rose 113 japanese yen to a closing 12410 
yen and edged up later in london to 12422 yen the dollar closed 
last friday in london at 12243 yen in london 
in london the british pound fell to 18150 from 18280 late 
thursday and 18490 late last friday 
other late dollar rates in europe compared with late thursdays 
rates included 17635 west german marks up from 17485 14895 
swiss francs up from 14725 59950 french francs up from 59745 
19805 dutch guilders up from 19665 129650 italian lire up 
from 128800 and 12055 canadian dollars up from 12054 
gold prices fell about 4 a troy ounce in nervous european 
trading the market has been unsetled by a 70 dollaranounce slump 
in platinum prices since ford motor co announced thursday that it 
had developed a platinumfree auto exhaust system 
catalytic converters account for about a third of the world 
consumption of newly mined platinum 
gold fell in both london and zurich to a late bid of 41225 a 
troy ounce down from 41645 bid in london and 416 bid in zurich 
late thursday 
earlier in hong kong gold fell 781 to close at a bid of 
41524 
silver bullion rose in london to a late bid of 612 a troy ounce 
from 611 bid late thursday

the bull market for platinum looked to be about as close to a 
sure thing as commodities speculators were likely to find supplies 
were down consumption was up and demand was expected to outstrip 
production for years to come 
then wham the bottom fell out thursday on sketchy news about 
an experimental device for controlling auto pollution sending 
investors scrambling for cover 
market analysts proclaimed a catastrophe and went looking for 
silver linings 
they found some and it didnt take long by friday morning some 
were saying the market had overreacted to ford motor cos 
announcement of a platinumfree catalytic converter at least one 
analyst richard levine of elders futures inc said the sharp 
decline in the metals value from 600 to about 520 an ounce on 
the cash market represented a very good buying opportunity 
what happened 
the best place to start is a 24page review of the platinum 
market published nov 15 by londonbased johnson matthey plc the 
worlds largest platinum refiner 
in its report johnson matthey predicted a supply shortfall for 
platinum for the next five years including a record 465000ounce 
shortfall in 1988 
platinum is an essential element in todays automobile 
pollutioncontrol systems the metal in conjunction with certain 
other metals acts as a catalyst in chemical reactions that convert 
harmful exhaust pollutants into harmless carbon dioxide and water 
this process occurs inside metal boxes called catalytic converters 
that have been required since 1975 on all cars sold in the united 
states 
johnson matthey said it expected the use of platinum in catalytic 
converters in 1988 to account for nearly 75 percent of platinum 
demand in north america and for more than a third of world demand 
for the metal 
and the refiner said new pollution standards in europe would 
contribute to a steady increase in global platinum demand for the 
next six years 
all this amounted to an extremely bullish outlook for platinum 
prices investor dollars streamed into the platinum market pushing 
the metals value up from 480 an ounce in late september to 620 an 
ounce early this month on the new york mercantile exchange 
on wednesday night ford chairman donald peterson announced in a 
speech in pittsburgh that ford was ready to test a catalytic 
converter that did not use platinum on thursday morning platinum 
prices collapsed 
then the facts began to filter in the ford device was only 
experimental and would be tested only on 40000 to 50000 cars in 
california global demand for platinum for catalytic converters 
would likely remain strong at least over the next year or two 
despite the new converter physical supplies of platinum for 
nearterm delivery were still very tight 
and in a rather startling development johnson matthey issued a 
statement saying it had collaborated with ford in the development of 
the new converter and that it had taken the device into account in 
preparing its november platinummarket review 
in the short to medium term we dont believe this development 
is going to have any effect on platinum supplydemand fundamentals 
and we feel platinums longterm supplydemand outlook is not at all 
bad said jack robson one of the authors of johnson mattheys 
november report in a telephone interview from london 
some market analysts were outraged by johnson mattheys failure 
to disclose its ford connections in its november supplydemand 
report one called it unconscionable 
but the market seemed reassured by the refiners statement 
platinums price stabilized friday at about 520 an ounce on the 
cash market 
i would say there still is tremendous physical demand for 
platinum and there will be for the foreseeable future said 
analyst levine my view is that 500 platinum too cheap and 600 
is probably more reflective of the current supplydemand 
fundamentals

share prices finished higher on the london stock 
exchange on friday fluctuating slightly in daylong quiet trading 
dealers attributed the gains to positive sentiment inspired by a 
growing belief that british interest rates might not have to rise 
further to quell inflationary pressures in the british economy 
the government reported friday that britains annual inflation 
rate held steady at 64 percent in november 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index finished up 
107 points or 06 percent at 17739 
dealers said the market gradually has been shaking off its 
previous concerns about the effects of high interest rates on 
british corporate profitability 
until recently many analysts thought the government would have 
to push base lending rates above the current 13 percent to slow down 
the british economy and choke off inflation 
but recent economic reports especially average earnings figures 
released thursday and retail sales figures published monday have 
suggested the economy already is responding to the higher interest 
rates 
volume was a moderate 4684 million shares up from thursdays

grain and soybean futures closed sharply higher 
friday on the chicago board of trade in a late rally triggered by 
rumors that the soviet union had bought large amounts of us corn 
and soybean meal 
rumors of soviet buying supported grain and soybean prices all 
week despite the lack of official confirmation 
large grain companies such as cargill inc and continental grain 
co kicked off the buying friday and suddenly it began to feed on 
itself said pat oconnell a grainmarket analyst with refco 
inc a chicagobased commodities brokerage house 
the rally accelerated through a number of buy stops or levels at 
which new buy orders are triggered he said 
corn prices rose high enough to encourage a fair amount of farmer 
selling but the market will have to reach better price levels to 
encourage further such selling oconnell said 
at the close wheat was 4 cents to 7 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in december at 436 a bushel corn was 2 
cents to 6 cents higher with december at 274 a bushel oats were 
1 cents to 6 cents higher with december at 220 a bushel soybeans 
were 6 cents to 14 cents higher with january at 785 a bushel

one of the hottest topics on wall street these 
days has been speculation over when the federal reserve would raise 
a key shortterm interest rate known as the discount rate 
thats the interest the fed charges on loans to member banks and 
savings institutions and its considered the most direct vehicle 
for the central bank to make its credit policies known most 
economists predicted the discount rate would be raised 05 
percentage point to 7 percent 
the fed already had given numerous indirect signals of its desire 
to keep credit tight 
this past week alone it stood by while another important 
interest rate the federal funds rate headed sharply higher the 
rate on funds or overnight loans between banks had gone as high as 
925 percent on thursday before closing at 887 percent up from 
837 wednesday the rate had been well below 8 percent for most of 
the summer 
had it wanted to keep interest rates down or loosen credit the 
fed would have injected more reserves into the open market through 
the purchase of government securities 
but it failed to counteract the uprward pressures that have 
taken place said william v sullivan director of money market 
research for dean witter reynolds inc that was a very clear 
signal 
over the past few months the fed has allowed the fed funds rate 
to move higher to keep inflation in check driving up the yields on 
treasury bills and most other shortterm securities longterm rates 
also have risen including rates on commercial mortgages and home 
equity loans 
some economists are predicting the bank prime lending rate which 
was raised a half percentage point to 105 percent in late november 
will reach 11 percent by the end of the year 
concerns about inflation coupled with the dollars recent 
weakness in foreign exchange have been mainly responsible for the 
rise in interest rates economists say 
carol a stone a senior economist for nomura securities 
international inc said this past weeks government report on 
retail sales especially fueled the inflation fears because it showed 
brisk economic growth 
the report said that november retail sales rose 11 percent 
following an upwardly revised 16 percent increase the previous 
month 
what we had thought some months ago was that consumer spending 
was only sluggish stone said it now looks like consumers 
have been spending at a pretty good rate since the summer and that 
theres more economic activity 
other economic reports released this past week showed that 
nationwide industrial production rose a brisk 05 percentage points 
in november and that factory use climbed 02 percentage points to 
the highest level in nine years 
raising interest rates will amount to throwing cold water on 
economic growth because it will make borrowing costs for businesses 
and consumers more expensive

frederick w smith was 27 years old in 1973 
when he created federal express corp a company designed to 
speedily fly checks and documents between federal reserve banks 
since then federal express has grown into the nations biggest 
express package carrier and a dominant force in the overnight 
delivery business 
the memphisbased company known to many americans by its 
offbeat television commercials and fleets of purpleandwhite jets 
and delivery vans reached another milestone friday when it 
announced an agreement to acquire tiger international inc for about 
880 million 
tiger is the nations biggest scheduled cargo transport company 
and has substantial foreign routes 
the buyout will greatly expand federals present fleet of 221 
aircraft and workforce of 63000 employees worldwide tiger flies 20 
boeing 747s six dc8s and 11 boeing 727s it also has two boeing 
747 passenger planes used for military contract flights 
federal express provides international service to more than 100 
countries either through subsidiaries licensees or by using 
independent contractors 
although for many people federal express name is synonymous with 
overnight delivery that business actually began in 1929 when united 
parcel service of america began flying ford trimotors along the 
west coast 
but federal express did launch modern overnight express services 
with its founding in 1973 adopting elements from the ground system 
of companies such as ups federal express invented an organizational 
system used by most overnight companies today known as spoke and 
hub 
but even federal didnt take off right away the governments 
cargo regulations limited the company to small planes and it wasnt 
until air cargo deregulation in 1977 that independent haulers were 
allowed to fly planes larger than dc3s 
in the late 1970s federal virtually was alone in the market 
allowing it to establish its delivery and communications systems 
without the pressure of competition other companies gradually 
followed 
the results have made federal one of the nations biggest 
transportationrelated concerns with about 32 billion in 
operating revenue last year it still trails greenwich connbased 
united parcel service which had about 97 billion in operating 
revenue last year 
federal express posted a profit of 1188 million on sales of 
22 billion in the first six months of the current fiscal year its 
revenue rose to 22 billion from 185 billion a year earlier 
in june federal express began package deliveries to japan 
marking its first venture into the far east and recently bought a 
100acre sorting facility in indianapolis with an eye to making it a 
hub in the 1990s existing hubs are memphis and brussels 
there have been setbacks in 1986 the company shut down its 
zapmail electronic document delivery service after two years of 
operation and operating losses of 317 million 
in june a federal judge in nashville dismissed a lawsuit in june 
by federal express challenging the state public service commissions 
attempt to regulate its truck delivery of packages between tennessee 
cities

the federal reserve board on friday approved 
new capital guidelines designed to push banks into safer investments 
or force them to put more of their stockholders money behind 
riskier activities 
the fed by a 60 vote approved the regulations which reward 
institutions for directing their deposits into prudent investments 
such as government securities and home mortgages 
starting dec 31 1990 banks will have to hold capital 
representing the stockholders investment in the institution of 
725 percent of loans and other assets the minimum will increase to 
8 percent two years later the current standard is 6 percent 
but banks will get a break for certain kind of investments they 
will only have to hold half as much capital for home mortgages 
onefifth as much capital for mortgagebacked securities sponsored 
by government agencies and no capital for us government securities 
diane casey director of regulatory affairs for the independent 
bankers association a trade group said the rules may have the 
effect of making more mortgage money available 
you will see banks that have ceased making mortgage loans 
looking again at mortgage loans because the riskweighting is such 
now that they can afford to make them she said 
the regulations could also provide a wider market in the united 
states for government securities which have increasingly been sold 
to investors in europe and japan she said 
board member wayne angell objected to the zero risk rating for 
government securities saying there is always some risk he 
also said the 20 percent rating for many mortgagebacked securities 
is on the side of inadequate and complained i see in front of 
me a document that doesnt do much 
however fed chairman alan greenspan said the regulations by 
their nature cannot be better than merely satisfactory 
vice chairman manuel johnson said the regulation was an 
important first step it may be unsatisfactory relative to some 
ideal but i think its highly satisfactory to where we were 
beginning with the effective date of the rule feb 15 banks 
will have to show that they are working toward meeting the stiffer 
requirements by the 1990 and 1992 deadlines 
an earlier version of the rules was approved by the federal 
reserve on aug 3 board member martha seger who dissented at the 
time was not present at fridays meeting 
fed staff members said they hoped by the end of 1990 to develop 
standards that would adjust banks capital according to their 
vulnerability to changes in interest rates the standards adopted 
friday apply to the risk of default 
other federal banking agencies the office of the comptroller of 
the currency which regulates nationally chartered banks and the 
federal deposit insurance which oversees federally insured state 
chartered banks are expected to approve similar capital guidelines 
soon the fed regulates bank holding companies and banks that belong 
to its system 
the rules bring us regulations into conformance with an 
international agreement adopted a year ago in basel switzerland by 
the fed and the central banks of 11 other major industrialized 
countries 
the federal home loan bank board which supervised savings 
institutions is working on riskbased capital rule but no action 
is expected until at least march

the dollars value rose friday strengthened by 
intensified speculation about higher us interest rates and 
increased yearend demand for the currency by multinational companies 
gold prices rose in late us trading after falling abroad in 
markets still jittery following thursdays selloff in platinum by 4 
pm est gold fetched 41350 a troy ounce at republic national 
bank of new york up 50 cents from a day earlier 
currency strategists said foreign exchange was influenced by 
fresh rumors that the federal reserve was preparing to raise the 
discount rate which by late friday remained at 65 percent 
the discount rate is the feds interest on loans to us 
financial institutions and is a strong influence over other interest 
rates a rise would tend to bolster the value of dollardenominated 
investments 
some foreign exchange dealers said the dollar also moved higher 
because of orders for the currency by usbased multinationals 
preparing to repatriate profits from overseas operations 
many companies evidently had been waiting to change currencies 
until late in the year hoping the dollar would fall as it has done 
for six out of the past eight years thereby making a conversion 
more attractive 
they figured theyd play that game again to the bitter end but 
this year it doesnt seem to be working said robert hatcher a 
senior dealer at the new york branch of britains barclays bank plc 
so they figure theyd bite the bullet and buy dollars now theres 
definitely an underlying demand for dollars here 
in tokyo the dollar rose 113 japanese yen to 12410 yen and 
traded later in london at 12422 yen by the time trading ended in 
new york the dollar fetched 12413 yen up from 12386 yen late

trading above 600 earlier this month 
i would consider this a very good buying opportunity he said

palladium a metal similar to but much cheaper than platinum and 
which is already used in conjunction with platinum in most 
converters

a delaware judge on friday invalidated 
pillsbury cos poison pill takeover defense setting up an 
expected appeal by pillsbury in its attempts to thwart a grand 
metropolitan plcs 549 billion hostile buyout bid 
retired justice william duffy of the court of chancery in 
wilmington del also issued a preliminary injunction blocking 
pillsburys plan to spin off its miamibased burger king corp 
another key element of pillsburys takeover defense 
earlier friday a minnesota state court judge also temporarily 
blocked the spinoff in a separate action requested by dissident 
pillsbury shareholders but withheld a ruling on the poison pill 
pending duffys decision 
however hennepin county dstrict judge thomas carey indicated he 
expected to side with the delaware courts ruling 
pillsbury a food and restaurant company based in minneapolis and 
incorporated in delaware had planned the burger king spinoff in an 
attempt to thwart grand met the british real estate liquor and 
gambling conglomerate 
duffy ruled on grand mets request to invalidate the poison pill 
so that it could go ahead with its 63ashare hostile tender offer 
the pill is considered pillsburys cornerstone defense against a 
takeover but an appeal would at least temporarily block grand met 
from buying the company 
stopping the poison pill was considered critical to grand mets 
tender offer because the defense would greatly increase the number 
of shares grand met would have to acquire making a buyout 
prohibitively expensive 
in the burger king transaction pillsbury planned to spin the 
fast food restaurant chain off into a new publicly traded company 
owned by pillsburys present shareholders 
the shareholders also would receive a special dividend payment 
and would retaing their stake in pillsbury 
in addition to grand met the proposed spinoff has been 
criticized by a number of burger king franchise holders on the 
grounds that the huge new debt needed to finance the special 
dividend would hinder the operations of the newly independent burger 
king 
in the minnesota case shareholders had filed a class action suit 
to compel pillsbury to negotiate with grand met a british 
conglomerate which launched a 60pershare tender offer on oct 4 
grand met sweetened its bid on monday to 63 a share or 55 
billion but pillsbury immediately rejected it as inadequate 
the shareholders said the plan threatened to block grand met from 
acquiring pillsbury pillsbury has said the spinoff would create a 
huge tax liability for grand met in the event of a takeover 
the record date of the spinoff was set for monday 
carey said the temporary enjoinment of the burger king spinoff 
causes insignificant harm to pillsbury and preserves the 
status quo 
careys ruling also denied the shareholders request to compel 
pillsbury to meet and bargain in good faith with grand met

creditmarket watchers said evidence was mounting that the 
federal reserve had decided to tighten credit conditions possibly 
in response to recent indications of rapid economic growth that 
could fuel higher inflation 
federal reserve policymakers met in private this week but 
normally dont report or comment on what steps they may have taken 
for about six weeks 
in the absence of a clear statement from the fed market watchers 
look for other signals that may indicate what it has decided to do

unchanged from late thursday the rate had been fluctuating near 8 
percent in the past few weeks before thursday

witter reynolds inc said the feds failure to buy securities and 
increase the money available to the banking system indicated the 
central bank had tightened 
he said he expects the fed soon will raise the discount rate its 
charge on loans to financial institutions which now is 6 percent 
im surprised they havent moved on the discount rate 
already he said 
sullivan also said expects banks to soon boost their prime rate 
which is at 10 percent and is used as a benchmark for bank interest 
on a variety of business and consumer loans 
sullivan said the bond market showed little reaction to a new 
report that producer prices rose 03 percent in november the rise 
was widely expected 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
governments rose 132 point intermediate issues were up point and 
20year issues were steady the telerate inc financialinformation

price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with maturities 
of a year or longer edged up 060 to 113038

the offer is conditioned on at least 501 percent of the flying 
tigers stock being tendered 
the merger is subject to the approval of the us transportation 
department and antitrust clearance from the justice department 
stockholders of both companies must also vote on the buyout 
federal express which covers the united states with 104 cargo

market for some time and has established routes to brussels and 
tokyo federal express carries overnight and secondday letters and 
packages of up to 150 pounds

the fliers civilian enterprise was the worlds first scheduled 
air cargo line and claims to be the biggest it has about 6500 
employees 
but tiger almost was forced into liquidation in 1986 after a run 
of losses blamed on illfated diversification moves high salaries 
and high fuel prices 
a lastminute agreement by workers to take pay cuts and make 
workrule concessions averted sale of the fleet and the company 
moved back into the black last year paying employees 16 million in 
profitsharing that was part of the recovery deal 
a decision has yet to be made on whether tiger will retain its 
identity the companies said 
federal express has ridden a boom in overnight mail for some

inflation at the wholesale level maintained its moderate pace 
during november while housing construction soared to its highest 
point in seven months the government said 
the labor department reported friday that wholesale prices rose 
03 percent in november as food costs showed no increases for the 
second straight month the stable food prices helped offset large 
increases for gasoline and heating oil 
the report helped to weaken theories that inflation is worsening 
the november increase if it persisted for 12 months would amount 
to an annual inflation rate of just 33 percent lower than the 38 
percent annualized rate for the first 11 months of 1987 
inflationary fears exceed inflationary reality at the present 
time said donald ratajczak director of economic forecasting at 
georgia state university in atlanta 
in another report friday the commerce department said new homes 
and apartments were built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
156 million units last month up from the 154 million rate in 
october 
it was the third increase in a row and the highest level of 
construction activity since april housing starts soared 51 percent 
in october and rose 04 percent in september 
housing permits a good barometer of future housing activity 
edged up 01 percent to a ratould have cost 10970 last month 40 
cents more than in october

cartel agreed to keep daily output levels at 185 million barrels to 
push up sagging worldwide oil prices 
marketwide optimism about opec brought oil prices sharply higher

the government has widened a securitiesfraud 
probe into dealings by drexel burnham lambert inc evidently 
unsatisfied with results of the investigation so far and impatient 
over the securities firms refusal to settle by admitting guilt and 
paying large penalties sources said 
theres no question the investigation has shifted into other 
areas said one of the sources who were familiar with the drexel 
probe but spoke on condition they not be identified theyve 
probably come to the realization they dont have enough 
the investigation once limited to allegations of a conspiracy 
between drexel and nowimprisoned speculator ivan boesky has been 
frustrated by a lack of substantive evidence and is spreading into 
possibly questionable dealings between the firm and other 
individuals these sources said friday 
evidence for the broadened probe is coming from three drexel 
highyield bond traders james dahl cary maultasch and terren 
peizer who are known to be cooperating with the government in 
exchange for lenient treatment 
these developments suggested the negotiations between drexel and 
the manhattan us attorney which have been going on for the past 
several weeks remain substantially unresolved despite predictions 
that a break in one of the biggest securities fraud cases in history 
could come before christmas 
bruce baird the assistant manhattan us attorney for securities 
fraud declined to comment on the drexel case drexel spokesman 
steven anreder also declined to comment 
the nations fifthlargest securities firm has been negotiating 
intensely with the us attorneys office to avoid a potentially 
ruinous indictment on fraud and racketeering charges the result of 
the investigation rooted in the boesky insider trading scandal 
as the negotiations have dragged on unconfirmed reports 
conflicting speculation and leaks of imminent settlements and sudden 
snags have persisted 
earlier in the week rumors flew that the firms highyield bond 
executive michael milken another key target in the probe had 
resigned abruptly the rumor was officially denied 
some sources disputed another report friday that suggested a rift 
was growing in drexels senior management over terms of a 
settlement which could include hundreds of millions of dollars in 
fines multiple guilty pleas and restraints on some of the firms 
most profitable operations 
a settlement also would almost certainly include the ouster of 
milken who regardless of what happens to drexel is expected to be 
indicted 
the wall street journal said key drexel executives leon black and 
peter ackerman were threatening to resign if a proposed agreement 
required the firm to cooperate with the government in prosecuting 
milken the driving force behind the firms prowess in the 175 
billion highyield junk bond market 
they didnt threaten to quit said one source in response to 
the journal account no such threat was made theyre still 
aboard 
others with knowledge of the situation said some drexel 
executives were growing exasperated with the governments tough 
negotiating position and were increasingly opposed to a settlement 
preferring to scrap it out in court 
some people are saying what the governments asking is 
unconscionable said one source if the government has its way 
its selling milken out its not fair and its not right 
drexel and milken have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in the 
protracted legal ordeal which began after boesky turned states 
evidence and paid the securities and exchange commission a record 
100 million fine for insider trading two years ago
