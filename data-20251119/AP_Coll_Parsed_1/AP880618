the yearning for the eastern and exotic which 
made scheherazade popular is seen in august bournonvilles 1855 
ballet abdallah 
the royal danish ballet danced it with grace and beauty friday 
night as part of its weeklong metropolitan opera season 
bournonville created exciting dancing for men and these tall 
danish dancers looked splendid the women are precise but in a 
smallscaled way their dancing is delicate and graceful heidi 
ryom as irina was the most sweetly feminine of them all 
linda hindberg had a small part but a good one as the leader of 
a harem a part which allowed the ballerina to show strength in her 
presentation alexander kolpin was striking in appearance and 
dancing in the title role 
bournonville told stories with charming simplicity and no 
subplots he wove in subtle mime gestures which explained 
conversations carrying the plot forward 
abdallah was out of the royal danish ballets repertory from 
1858 to 1985 when the late dancer toni lander and dancer flemming 
ryberg reconstructed it from bournonvilles notations on the holger 
simon paulli music score 
it isnt as fast moving as napoli with which the danes 
opened the met season but it is equally as delightful

a federal magistrate has rejected a government 
request to extradite a man to israel to face charges in a 1986 
terrorist bombing in jerusalem saying he was likely acting to 
achieve a political aim 
us magistrate john caden ruled friday there was probable 
cause to believe that the defendant mahmoud abed atta 34 
committed the bombing in furtherance of the political objective 
of the palestine liberation organization 
therefore caden said atta who also uses the name mahmoud 
elabed ahmad was protected under the political offense 
exception of us law and placed him outside the jurisdiction of 
the extradition treaty between the united states and israel 
caden also said he had no governance over the case because atta 
had been brought to the united states in a constitutionally 
impermissible manner 
assistant us attorney john gleeson said the government would 
seek an immediate stay of the order pending a possible appeal or 
other recourse 
while this court does not approve the actions taken by ahmad 
nor does it desire to express support for either side in this 
conflict the fact remains that the conflict exists and that the 
political offense exception was formulated to protect the rights of 
those whose philosophy may differ from ours to fight for a way of 
life they believe in caden said in a 72page written decision 
his order expresses no opinion as to the legitimacy of the 
palestine objectives the israeli treatment of the arabs or the 
legitimacy of the occupancy of the west bank he said 
atta who has been described by the fbi as a member of the plo 
has been charged with hurling a firebomb into a bus on april 12 
1986 in the israelioccupied west bank the bus driver was killed 
and eight passengers were injured two other people have been 
convicted in israel of participating in the attack 
atta has been held without bail at the federal metropolitan 
correctional center in manhattan since his arrest in may 1987 
during a flight from venezuela to kennedy airport 
atta who was born in ramala on the west bank and became an 
american citizen in 1982 was held on an extradition warrant from 
israel which does not have a treaty with venezuela 
a call to attas lawyer ramsey clark for comment was not 
returned

a federal judge says the toledo zoo can 
continue at least for now to exhibit two giant pandas on loan 
from china but the zoo can no longer collect the extra 2 fee it 
has been charging 
us district judge norma holloway johnson on friday granted a 
preliminary injunction sought by the world wildlife fund and the 
american association of zoological parks and aquariums the groups 
wanted the pandas returned to china and their import permit 
invalidated because they say the exhibit exploits an endangered 
species 
the pandas named le le and nan nan have been on exhibit at 
the zoo since may 24 after the us fish and wildlife service 
issued the import permit 
the wildlife fund contends the permit should not have been 
issued because the zoos plans did not meet federal requirements 
that endangered animals be imported only if the importation is for 
purposes which are not detrimental to the survival of the 
species and the animals are not to be used for primarily 
commercial purposes 
johnson said the fish and wildlife service had not been aware 
the zoo was charging a special fee to view the pandas so there was 
no evidence the agency had even considered the commercial nature of 
the exhibition 
the wildlife fund had however demonstrated a likelihood of 
success on the merits on this issue johnson said but the judge 
added that a full hearing on whether the exhibit should be closed 
would be scheduled later 
ellen efros an attorney for the zoo had argued before johnson 
monday that the zoo had established the separate fee for the panda 
exhibit for financial accounting purposes only 
ms efros said closing the exhibit would rob the public of a 
chance to view an endangered species and learn something about 
china in addition she said it could have a potentially harmful 
effect on uschinese relations

cubas prison population has sunk to its 
lowest level since the 1959 revolution following the release of 
thousands of detainees under a new penal code cuban justice 
minister juan escalona said 
in a dispatch monitored friday in mexico city the cuban 
governments prensa latina news agency quoted escalona as saying 
that several thousands of prisoners were freed under a 
45dayold penal code reform 
the changes replaced mandatory jail terms with monetary fines 
for 60 crimes and reduced sentences for other types of convictions 
prensa latina said 
escalona said 794 prisoners were freed because the crimes for 
which they were convicted no longer existed under the reform more 
than 6000 pending cases were retired for the same reason he said 
in all nearly 22000 penal cases were revised after the reform 
was enacted he said 
the prensa latina dispatch did not identify the nature of the 
cases affected or whether crimes considered political in nature 
were included 
amnesty international the worldwide human rights group said in 
its 1987 annual report that 450 political prisoners were being held 
in cuba 
escalona said that because of the modifications the current 
prison population is the lowest the country has had in the history 
of the revolution 
the justice minister made his remarks in a meeting with the 
national assemblys constitutional and juridical affairs commission

if you run short of cash at the end of the 
month imagine the dismay of newly elected mayor art agnos when he 
found san francisco in the same boat floundering in 179 million 
of red ink 
when former mayor dianne feinstein turned over the reins to 
agnos in january she boasted of the citys fiscal strength and 
pointed proudly to nine consecutive years of balanced budgets 
when she first took office the city faced a 120 million 
deficit once during her tenure there was a substantial surplus 
three years ago the city faced a 76 million deficit but erased 
it through budget cuts 
as feinstein left she warned of the toll taken on city finances 
by the aids epidemic homeless problem proposition 13 and the 
elimination of the federal revenuesharing programs 
other factors contributing to the latest deficit she said 
included unforeseen costs of toxic controls comparable worth jail 
expenses decreased water revenues and repeal of a utility tax that 
cut revenue by 10 million 
while agnos acknowledges the problems feinstein cited he 
criticized her administration after arriving at city hall to find a 
flood of red ink facing him for fiscal 19881989 
raiding reserves for a onetime fix that will simply roll the 
deficit problem into the next year does not solve our budget 
problem agnos said in fact that is how we got into this 
deficit situation in the first place 
its frankly to be expected said paul varacalli head of 
local 790 of united public employees the largest representative of 
city workers every year for the last decade weve gone through 
this doom and gloom thats the way this city runs 
in a bid to partially refill the citys coffers agnos backed 
proposition k on the june 7 ballot the measure would have allowed 
san francisco to raise strict spending limits set by the statewide 
gann initiative and collect additional taxes from businesses 
hotels and parking 
without that permission from voters agnos warned that essential 
city services would suffer he called for wage freezes and forecast 
that 160 police officers would have to go along with three fire 
stations and four library branches 
agnos watched in dismay as voters rejected the measure sending 
a message to city hall to live within its means 
the voters did provide some help approving a measure that will 
save 43 million by freezing city employee salaries 
with a july deadline looming for adoption of a tentative budget 
and august deadline for the final document battle lines are being 
drawn 
union leaders city supervisors department heads private 
business executives neighborhood representatives and city 
employees are making their cases in backrooms boardrooms and 
rallies at city hall 
but despite the mayors warning that there are no magic 
bailouts he appears to have found a few surprise windfalls to 
help fill out the 179 million shortfall 
a week after the election the mayor announced the city had 
discovered it mistakenly counted courtmandated expenses when 
setting its spending limit 
by excluding such expenses agnos said san francisco can raise 
the limit by an estimated 20 to 30 million that means business 
taxes and fees can be implemented and public safety layoffs may not 
be needed 
a few days earlier budget analysts said they had uncovered 
about 16 million in additional spending potential because a 1981 
muni fare hike was incorrectly charged against the gann limit 
agnos said he would not have put proposition k on the ballot if 
he had known the citys spending limit could be raised by excluding 
courtmandated costs 
meanwhile the chamber of commerces board of directors voted 
wednesday to oppose agnos proposed business taxes and fees 
supervisor harry britt says he expects the mayors budget to 
gain board of supervisors approval longtime tax foe richard 
hongisto urged fellow supervisors to pull together to support the 
entire package for the sake of unity

president reagan says the law of averages 
dictates there will be corruption in pentagon procurement and he 
praised how federal agents have handled what republican senators 
call a bribery investigation of unprecedented scale 
some 275 grand jury subpoenas have been issued to companies and 
individuals this week said federal law enforcement sources 
speaking on condition of anonymity attorney general edwin meese 
iii said he anticipates indictments by the end of the summer 
but reps roy dyson dmd and bill chappell dfla dismissed 
reports that they had come under scrutiny in the investigation 
while two more defense contractors martin marietta corp and ltv 
corp disclosed that they had been served with subpoenas in the 
probe 
reagan said he was very proud of the investigators who 
conducted the probe without telling the president until this week 
the secret investigation meant there was no panicking and no 
leaks or anyone running for cover reagan said on cnns 
moneyline 
but with about six million people involved in the defense 
procurement process the law of averages says that not all six 
million are going to turn out to be heroes he said 
dyson confirmed in a telephone interview friday night from his 
home that he and his late aide tom pappas had met with a military 
consultant and former vice president of unisys corp charles 
gardner in new york the weekend pappas committed suicide 
the fbi served a search warrant tuesday on gardners home in 
malverne ny as well as on unisys plants and offices in great 
neck ny and eagan minn 
it was a very standard invitation to come tour their plant 
get a briefing on a number of programs unisys is involved in 
dyson said adding that as a member of the house armed services 
committeee theres really nothing unusual about that 
the congressman noted that there is a unisys facility two miles 
from his home and his district includes a large navy facility the 
patuxent naval air test center 
dyson said the defense probe had nothing to do with pappas 
suicide may 1 when he leaped to his death from a hotel room in new 
york city 
a government source familiar with the probe said that dyson is 
not under active investigation

sen charles grassley an iowa republican who sits on the 
committee said in a senate speech that the matter is widespread 
beyond the wildest imagination of whats going on 
chappell dfla chairman of the house appropriations 
subcommittee on defense characterized as a bunch of bunk a 
report friday in the los angeles times that he is under scrutiny in 
the case chappells panel oversees defense spending 
a company in chappells congressional district armtec inc of 
palatka fla is one of 15 defense contractors whose offices were 
searched by fbi agents tuesday 
armtecs president william w roberts is a personal friend of 
the chappells he said his company is not aware of any 
wrongdoing and will cooperate with investigators

accepted 3000 in speaking fees from defense firms searched by the 
fbi

both paisley and lyons were close associates of former navy 
secretary john f lehman jr 
the washington post reported today that former defense secretary 
caspar weinberger was told when he held that office that lehmans 
office was a principal point of origin for leaks of classified 
budgetary documents relating to contracts and that at least five 
people had continuously disclosed classified documents

in alexandria va in early 1986 was prepared in connection with 
a pending criminal case against a former defense consultant the 
post said law enforcement officials that it did not identify said 
the document is unrelated to the defense fraud probe

conducting the investigation and grassley the senator asked 
hudson whether lehman was a target of the investigation and hudson 
replied no comment

not everyone is complaining about the drought 
baking farmland and stranding river barges say tv weather 
forecasters who say theyre prepared to take the heat for any kind 
of weather 
no matter what you do you cant win said andy avalos of 
wlstv in chicago who added that some people are enjoying the 
sunny weather and 90degree temperatures accompanying the dry spell 
avalos was among about 200 forecasters who converged friday 
morning on a downtown hotel for the american meteorological 
societys 18th conference on broadcast meteorology 
forecasters may sometimes have trouble predicting the weather 
but they know they can expect scattered complaints under any 
conditions 
always no matter what the weather is there is someone 
unhappy with it said gail lynne of klfytv in lafayette la a 
fiveyear veteran of television forecasting 
its too hot too dry too humid she said quoting 
complaints she has heard 
most people get quite angry said avalos a 12year veteran 
of weather prediction 
they always blame the weatherman when the weatherman is wrong 
of course he added with a grin and they always blame the 
weatherman when the weather is lousy and you cant please 
everybody regardless of what the forecast is no matter how 
accurate you are 
the meeting featured three days of sessions ranging from 
numerical probabilities in weather forecasting and 
fourdimensional rendering of satellite data to the weather 
and politics who wins elections when the weather turns bad 
i dont think theres anything specifically on the program 
thats droughtrelated said cheryll jones of wagatv and cable 
news network in atlanta where drought has necessitated water 
rationing 
but im sure before the whole thing is over with in some of 
the sessions it will be mentioned and discussed she said 
theres always a lot of information to be learned at a conference 
like this 
everybody wants to know when its going to rain said eric 
nefstead of wrextv in rockford who has been doing weather for 15 
years 
they ask you every day well whats new today you know is 
there any hope he said 
added ms jones its real frustrating this time of the year 
when you have the spotty type of showers and thundershowers 
and you cant promise everyone that theyll get one 
and when they do come theyre so sparse and theyre so 
insignificant that in terms of the overall water needs its a big 
letdown she said speaking from her 10 years of forecasting 
experience

portauprince haiti ap president leslie manigat has fired 
his armed forces commander and two other generals to cap the first 
major confrontation between the new civilian government and the 
powerful military 
a presidential communique read on national television late 
friday said manigat had retired commander in chief lt gen henri 
namphy and two other members of the general staff brigadier 
generals carl michel nicholas and wilton cherisson 
namphy led a threeman junta that governed haiti for two years 
until manigat won a popular election in january at the time 
critics lambasted manigat as the militarys puppet 
namphy had no immediate public response to the move 
the communique said namphy and other army officers had defied 
manigats decision wednesday to rescind an order tranfering and 
retiring several highranking officers 
at the center of the struggle is col jeanclaude paul indicted 
on drugtrafficking charges earlier this year by a grand jury in 
miami namphy wanted to demote him to an administrative post while 
manigat opposed the move 
manigat said namphys order was unconstitutional because it was 
made without consulting him the constitution names the president 
as nominal chief of the armed forces and the head of the army 
as the effective commander 
a struggle has begun between manigat namphy and jeanclaude 
paul someone will have to come out on top the personal security 
of each man is at stake said hubert de ronceray runnerup to 
manigat in the juntarun jan 17 elections 
manigat was named president he wants to prove he is not a 
puppet he will go all the way to the end de ronceray said in a 
telephone interview after namphy was fired 
perhaps he is acting by stages to get one military man after 
another under control finally to win the good graces of the 
americans he said 
us officials have backed popular elections and civilian 
control in haiti one of the poorest countries in the western 
hemisphere 
another major presidential candidate in the elections gregoire 
eugene said as soon as the first presidential communique was 
issued on wednesday we should have expected a followup we will 
have to wait and see what happens 
manigat appeared to have aligned himself with paul when he 
rescinded namphys order transferring paul as commander of the 
700man dessalines barracks to assistant chief of staff the 
dessalines barracks is one of the nations most feared army units 
and paul reportedly refused to accept the transfer 
soldiers under pauls command were blamed for widespread 
violence against voters that forced cancellation of novembers 
independently administered general elections and left more than 30 
people dead 
it was not clear why namphy ordered the transfer his order 
could represent a power struggle within the army or the transfer 
may involve the drugrunning charges against paul who has denied 
the accusations 
nicolas one of the fired generals denied earlier this year 
that paul was involved in drug trafficking and accused the foreign 
press of singling him out for attack 
manigat took over on feb 7 from namphy as haitis chief 
executive namphy had been president of the threeman junta since 
then presidentforlife jeanclaude duvalier fled to exile in 
france 
manigat met four hours wednesday with the army general staff 
headed by namphy and obtained a statement from the staff pledging 
allegiance to civilian rule and tentatively accepting manigats 
decision to overrule namphys transfer of paul 
manigats decree friday said that despite their pledge on 
wednesday namphy and other members of the general staff began to 
execute the order retiring and transferring officers 
it said their action is a sort of insubordination toward 
the constitutional commander in chief 
the communique said all cabinet members endorsed manigats 
action including defense minister williams regala who was the 
other military member with namphy on the junta

britain has ordered the expulsions of an israeli 
diplomat and a plo official and expressed irritation with israeli 
spying after a palestinian double agent was convicted of weapons 
violations 
the foreign office said friday it was expelling israeli attache 
arie regev and the plos london press officer zaki al hawa 
because of activities incompatible with their diplomatic duties 
the phraseology is used as a euphemism for espionage the 
ministry gave no other details of their activities 
it said they must leave the country by the end of june 
fridays order came a day after a british court convicted a 
palestinian on weapons charges prosecutors had accused him of 
spying for israel while he did favors for the palestine liberation 
organization 
the ministry made it clear that britain had expressed annoyance 
that the israeli intelligence agency mossad had not kept britain 
informed of its operations here 
mossads failure to do so cost scotland yard a chance to arrest 
a plo member linked to the murder of an arab cartoonist in london 
last summer 
the ministry also disclosed that israeli ambassador yehuda avner 
was told in october that a former member of his staff attache 
jacob barad would not be allowed to return to britain 
reports published today said barad who arrived in london in 
1984 and left in the summer of 1987 was suspected of coordinating 
the work of mossad with regev who also arrived here in 1984 
it is believed to be the first time that israeli diplomats have 
been declared persona non grata in britain since diplomatic 
relations were established after israel was founded 40 years ago 
in jerusalem a foreign ministry spokesman regretted that 
britain has seen fit to take measures of the kind adopted israel 
did not act against any british interests 
the plo office said it was dismayed by the expulsion order on al 
hawa and contrasted its own constant respect for british law 
with israels flagrant disregard of it 
the expulsions came a day after a 28yearold palestinian 
ishmael sowan was sentenced to 11 years in prison he was 
convicted in old bailey criminal court wednesday of possessing 
explosives grenades and rifles 
prosecutors said he kept the weapons for abder mustapha a plo 
member suspected of arranging the shooting death of arab cartoonist 
ali naji awad aladhami but sowan was at the same time spying on 
mustapha for mossad the prosecution alleged 
in its trial coverage the times of london said mossad failed to 
tell british authorities that mustapha was in britain britain had 
issued an exclusion order against mustapha and was unaware he had 
returned 
news reports said the exclusion order against mustapha was 
issued because of suspicion about his activities not evidence of 
an offense 
sowan was arrested in augustwhen police were investigating the 
shooting of the cartoonist however he was not a murder suspect 
sowan testified that the weapons found in his house in the 
eastern port city of hull belonged to mustapha police said 
mustapha fled to the middle east after aladhami was shot 
the times said mustapha was linked to murders of three israeli 
vacationers on a yacht at larnaca cyprus in june 1986 he also 
was wanted in connection with an attack on an israeli el al bus in 
west germany in 1970 the newspaper said 
the british foreign office said it understood that al hawa 47 
who arrived here last year was a member of force 17 which 
provides personal security for plo leader yasser arafat and senior 
officials overseas 
however it said there was no evidence the plo office in london 
was involved in operations the guerrilla movement was planning 
the times said today that the activities of intelligence agents 
from friendly countries are usually tolerated in britain and 
that mossads work has until now been welcomed because the 
israelis are seen as being exceptionally effective against arab 
terrorism 
but another daily newspaper the independent said regevs 
expulsion reflected mounting british criticism of mossads 
activities in britain 
mossad was alleged to have been involved in the attempted 
abduction in london in 1984 of a former nigerian cabinet minister 
umaru dikko who was wanted in lagos for alleged corruption 
the family of mordechai vanunu claimed the former israeli 
technician was lured from britain by a mossad agent and kidnapped 
after disclosing his countrys nuclear secrets to a british 
newspaper 
a month after vanunus disappearance in september 1986 israel 
acknowledged he was in custody in israel he was sentenced in march 
to 18 years in prison for treason and espionage

thailand forcing the evacuation of about 350 villagers living 
along the frontier the officer said 
chainarong said thai troops guarding the border responded by 
firing warning shots into cambodia 
the khmer rouge are the strongest of three cambodian guerrilla 
groups fighting vietnamese forces who invaded cambodia in late 
1978 a vietnamese offensive in late 1984 and early 1985 wiped out 
the major guerrilla bases along the thaicambodian border and the 
three groups have since reverted to small unit insurgencystyle 
warfare 
the khmer rouge ruled cambodia from 1975 until vietnam invaded 
it in late 1978 the ultraleftist group killed millions of 
cambodians during its rule pushing a radical brand of agrarian 
communism

a prominent historian said famed revolutionary 
leon trotsky should be exonerated along with other leaders falsely 
accused and purged in the early years of the soviet state 
we have to rehabilitate all those people who were repressed 
and who were accused on false evidence and all those accused must 
be rehabilitated yuri afanasyev said friday and in line with 
those people is trotsky 
afanasyev in one of the boldest proposals to date since leader 
mikhail s gorbachev undertook his glasnost campaign for 
greater openness also called for publication in the soviet union 
of trotskys banned works 
exonerating trotsky of criminal charges would be another major 
step toward the rehabilitation of early soviet leaders who were 
purged and killed by kremlin leader josef stalin 
publishing trotskys work and revoking the criminal charges 
against him would continue an intensifying campaign against the 
legacy of stalin who died in 1953 
it could also lead to reexamination of the key role that trotsky 
played in the 1917 bolshevik revolution creating the red army and 
leading the communists to victory against counterrevolutionaries in 
the ensuing russian civil war 
that might lead soviet historians to reevaluate the role played 
by vladmir i lenin the founder of the soviet state who relied 
heavily on trotsky during the early years of bolshevik rule 
the soviets have already taken several steps in this direction 
even publishing an article mildly critical of lenin 
the journal novy mir reported this month that lenin was 
excessively harsh in abolishing all private property establishing 
labor camps and heavily taxing peasants the article said lenin 
later saw that he was wrong 
following lenins death in 1924 stalin defeated trotsky in a 
power struggle forcing him out of the communist party in 1927 and 
out of the soviet union two years later 
trotsky was accused of leading an antisoviet plot and was 
murdered in mexico city in 1940 reportedly on stalins orders 
until last fall trotsky was a nonperson in the soviet 
union his writings and works universally condemned 
asked whether the works of trotsky and former soviet leader 
nikita khrushchev might be published soon afanasyev answered 
i can speak on behalf on myself and think they should be 
republished and accessible for all i think its very strange 
when professors and teachers try to criticize trotsky while they 
havent read a single word by trotsky afanasyev told a news 
conference at the foreign ministry press center 
afanasyev said that exonerating trotsky of criminal charges and 
publishing his books would not constitute an endorsement of his 
ideas which are out of line with the more liberal policies of 
gorbachev 
trotsky born lev bronstein was the son of a prosperous jewish 
farmer he helped direct the coup that brought the bolsheviks to 
power then became commissar for foreign affairs and later war 
creating and commanding the red army 
he is known as the main advocate of the theory of permanent 
revolution which held that the bolshevik revolution was a 
prelude to class uprisings throughout europe 
after the death of lenin stalin rallied his forces under the 
slogan of socialism in one country arguing that a socialist 
state could be created in the soviet union despite the failure of 
revolutions elsewhere in europe 
trotsky also advocated raising capital for building up industry 
at the expense of the peasants stalin at that time called for 
leniency against the peasants backing a policy authored by nikolai 
bukharin and supported by the two other leading bolsheviks lev 
kamenev and gregory zinoviev 
trotsky was feared by his rivals for his skills as an orator and 
organizer his popularity among youth and his support in the red 
army 
following the defeat of trotsky stalin switched tactics and 
together with kamenev and zinoviev began forced collectivization 
of agriculture from 1929 to 1932 causing a famine and costing the 
lives of millions of peasants 
stalin later had bukharin kamenev and zinoviev tried sentenced 
and executed in the purges of 193637 
bukharin whose ideas are similar to those advocated by 
gorbachev was exonerated of criminal charges in february as were 
kamenev and zinoviev on monday 
the soviet supreme court on monday also exonerated karl radek 
and gregory pyatakov who were convicted in 1937 of plotting with 
trotsky against stalin 
the exoneration of radek and pyatakov raised the possibility 
that trotsky might receive similar treatment none of those 
exonerated would be fully rehabilitated until their party 
membership was restored 
gorbachev in a major speech nov 2 became the first soviet 
leader in decades to mention trotsky publicly but he condemned 
trotskys call for world revolution

international drug smugglers linked to 
panamanian strongman manuel noriega conspired to import more than 
1 billion worth of cocaine and marijuana into the united states a 
federal indictment charges 
the 25count indictment unsealed friday at lafayette police 
headquarters accused 170 people of smuggling 500000 pounds of 
drugs some of it through south louisiana and with plotting to 
smuggle in at least another million pounds 
the total value of the drugs involved was placed at more than 1 
billion and us attorney joe cage called it perhaps the largest 
us narcotic smuggling ring ever he said the organization planned 
to flood the united states with illicit drugs 
its sole motivation greed and money caused its scope and 
influence to transcend local national and international 
boundaries cage said 
fridays charges were a spinoff from the same federal 
investigation that resulted in the indictment of noriega on charges 
that he laundered us drug money through panamanian banks said 
lawyers involved in the case 
the louisiana indictments disclosed that that noriega allegedly 
laundered profits from the sale of marijuana shipped to a louisiana 
shipyard 
had noriega not been indicted on drug charges in florida he 
probably would have been here said the attorney for the federal 
task force that coordinated the multistate investigation 
i cant speak for a grand jury but in my opinion there would 
have been sufficient evidence for an indictment of noriega 
said judith lombardino lawyer for the federal organized crime drug 
enforcement task force 
also friday a federal grand jury in denver indicted a purported 
colombian drug lord pablo emilio escobargaviria identified as a 
principal in the medellin drug cartel of medellin colombia 
the fivecount indictment alleges that escobargaviria 39 and 
five others planned to ship up to 800 kilograms of cocaine a week 
into the denver area authorities estimated that amount of cocaine 
could have a street value of up to 17 million 
escobar also is under federal indictment in florida on charges 
of conspiracy to import and distribute drugs said us attorney 
michael j norton 
sixtyfive of those charged in the 131page louisiana indictment 
were identified as john doe and cage would not say if the 
indictment had connections with the medellin cartel thought to be 
responsible for much of the cocaine sold in the united states 
several arrests were made but cage refused to say how many nor 
would he identify any of those indicted as ringleaders saying each 
played a vital role in the success of the organization 
the charges resulted from a 2yearold federal investigation 
that stretched into florida north carolina and michigan cage said 
about 500000 pounds of marijuana was imported to and 
distributed from lafayette and several thousand pounds of cocaine 
was flown to shreveport he said 
the indictment also said 280000 pounds of the marijuana entered 
through the south louisiana region known as acadiana 
the indictment said 250000 pounds of colombian marijuana was 
seized on june 18 1983 aboard a barge in the vermilion parish 
community of bancker an additional 30000 pounds of marijuana was 
seized a few days later at a nearby house cage said 
the indictment said the plan was to unload the drugs at the 
intracoastal drydock and shipbuilding co owned and operated by 
the faciane family of abbeville william e faciane and james c 
faciane were among those indicted cage said 
this organization schemed to flood this country and its people 
with illegal drugs he said it is sophisticated 
wellorchestrated and rivals any multinational corporation 
the information that led to the louisiana indictments also led 
to 82 federal indictments earlier in florida north carolina and 
michigan cage said among those 82 was noriega

vietnam campaign to accepting a political settlement in the 
region 
the issue of the khmer rouge blamed for the deaths of 1 million

said he was getting phone calls about the poster kcbstv in los 
angeles tracked it down and made a video of the real pier in nearby 
manhattan beach 
its the spitting image cbsflorida reporter dick kane said 
the state saved several thousand dollars by using an advertising

picture for the poster mayberry said 
they changed account executives and somewhere in the process 
we didnt make sure that this picture was taken in florida

authorities have broken a nationwide ring 
trafficking in teenage girls arresting 66 people involved in 
kidnapping and selling more than 200 girls into slavery an 
official report said today 
the girls most of whom were abducted at train stations were 
raped before they were sold the peasants daily said 
authorities were in the process of locating and freeing the 
girls the report said 
they were tipped off in november 1987 when a 17yearold girl 
identified her abductor but the report did not say when the 
arrests were made 
the ring was based in zhengzhou a transportation center in 
henan province in central china but operated throughout central 
southern and western china covering more than 20 provinces the 
report said 
members of the wellorganized operation were responsible for 
specific tasks including management sales communications and 
abducting the goods the paper said 
the girls were given code names depending on which part of the 
country they came from how they were abducted or their marital 
status 
girls who were married were called white goods those who 
were single were referred to as yellow goods 
the girls were fooled into thinking their abductors would find 
them a job or wanted them to be their adopted sisters or daughters 
the report said 
a 15yearold girl who ran away from home after fighting with 
her parents was picked up at the railroad station in xian shanxi 
province raped and sold to anhui province she was later resold 
for 730 it said 
two girls from sichuan province one 15 years old and the other 
16 were on their way home after visiting relatives in zhengzhou 
when they were abducted at the zhengzhou railway station one was 
sold for 810 the other for 946 the paper said 
all three girls were severely beaten by their owners and 
forbidden to leave the house 
the report quoted an officer of the zhengzhou public security 
bureau as saying that while the crimes were not the direct result 
of chinas reform policies they were caused by economic reforms 
that have forced peasants to leave the farm and forced workers out 
of jobs 
he also criticized the peasants who bought the girls for their 
ignorance of the law he said when authorities went to free a girl 
in shandong province angry peasants tried to stop them saying 
we dont steal we dont rob we used our own money to buy a 
girl whats wrong with that

more than 300 bodies remain unburied during 
the third week of a cemetery workers strike south of the city and 
some of the 17 funeral homes warned they soon may run out of 
storage space for caskets 
we have ample storage space for about a month said gene 
dessem an embalmer at white oaks chapel in san carlos but soon 
we might have to move to storing the bodies in warehouses 
funeral homes are bearing an unfair burden said ivana flynn 
administrator at crippen and flynn funeral home in redwood city 
it should be against the law she said human bodies being 
stuck somewhere waiting to be buried i dont think thats right 
garden chapel in south san francisco is using a garage as a 
temporary holding place for eight bodies awaiting burial 
richard noftsger the funeral homes manager said the mortuary 
is embalming all bodies that will not be immediately buried even 
if the family did not desire it 
while mortuary workers said the biggest inconvenience would be 
for families waiting to bury their loved ones one mortuary 
official said she believed leaving bodies unburied was a serious 
health hazard 
especially in the summertime our refrigeration unit only can 
fit one or two said ivana flynn administrator of crippen and 
flynn funeral home in redwood city 
mortuaries are using special embalming methods to preserve the 
bodies for an extended period dessem said 
the walkout centers on claims by the workers union that under 
current provisions cemeteries can hire subcontractors for work 
usually performed by union employees 
about 150 union members responsible for burials gardening and 
general maintenance at 17 cemeteries walked off the job may 30 two 
days after contract talks broke down the threeyear contract 
expired in march 
talks were scheduled through the weekend but picketers said 
they would stay a whole year outside the cemetery gates if they 
have to

former gov evan mecham cleared of 
criminal charges that he tried to hide a campaign loan says hes 
considering a new bid for the post he lost to a senate impeachment 
conviction 
that one the governorship will come up in 1990 and yes 
thats certainly an option mecham told reporters friday adding 
there also was always a chance of a campaign this year for us 
senate or congress 
a jury on thursday acquittted mecham and his brother willard 
on criminal charges of concealing the 350000 campaign loan 
the 64yearold republican was removed from office april 4 when 
the state senate convicted him of two unrelated impeachment counts 
mecham told reporters after the verdict that he had no 
vindictive feelings but he accused attorney general bob corbin of 
abusing his office and vowed to support a petition drive to recall 
the prosecutor 
we went through eight months of misery after corbins 
investigation of the campaign loan began last fall mecham said 
thank god those jurors could see through the accusations and get 
to the facts 
the former governor also accused a court of appeals judge whom 
he did not name of ruling on an appeal in his criminal case 
despite having openly declared that i was dishonest and should be 
in jail 
mechams attorney michael scott said a complaint might be 
filed with the state bar associations judicial ethics committee 
willard mecham his brothers 1986 campaign treasurer said 
testifying before state grand juries was by far the most evil 
experiences i have ever had the perjury in this case was committed 
by the state attorneys who prosecuted us 
evan mecham said he felt vindicated on the legal issues but 
justice in the political arena will take a little longer 
mecham said his political action committee forward arizona 
will work to elect a legislature that represents the people and 
not the hidden power brokers 
he said the group will consider starting an alternative 
newspaper to counter what he views as a biased phoenix press plans 
are in the works for two books a tv movie and a feature film he 
said joking that he would like to be portrayed by actor clint 
eastwood 
he said his legal defense cost about 550000 almost half of 
which has been contributed by supporters 
during a news conference at his private office mecham was 
jubilant while his brother often appeared on the verge of tears 
afterward mecham cut a cake that said truth prevails evan and 
willard 
mecham was prosecuted for failing to itemize the 350000 
campaign loan from attorneydeveloper barry wolfson on either his 
personal or campaign finance reports 
the defense contended the loan was properly reported as part of 
a 465000 lump sum listed as a contribution from mecham and that 
the failure to itemize it was an innocent mistake by willard mecham 
mecham was acquitted of all six charges of perjury willful 
concealment and filing false documents his brother was acquitted 
of three similar counts

a panel of scientists has recommended naming 
the moons of uranus after the literary characters of william 
shakespeare and alexander pope rather than the crew killed when the 
space shuttle challenger exploded 
were following the tradition of naming the moons after 
shakespearean characters and characters from alexander popes 
the rape of the lock said us geological survey planetary 
geologist hal masursky who chairs the international astronomical 
unions planetary system nomenclature working group 
it wasnt intended to be a slight to the thousands of 
schoolchildren citizens and officials who wrote letters and signed 
petitions proposing naming the moons for the astronauts brian 
marsden director of the iaus central bureau for astronomical 
telegrams said friday 
he said seven asteroids were named for challenger astronauts two 
months after the shuttle exploded after liftoff jan 28 1986 the 
iau also will name seven lunar craters for francis scobee michael 
j smith judith resnik ronald mcnair ellison onizuka gregory 
jarvis and teacherastronaut sharon christa mcauliffe he said 
uranus has 15 known moons 10 of which were discovered in 
december 1985 and january 1986 by nasas voyager 2 spacecraft the 
probes triumphant jan 24 1986 close encounter with uranus was 
overshadowed by the challenger tragedy 
marsden said the iaus executive committee decided in a private 
meeting in san diego last september to endorse the proposal by 
masurskys working group to name nine new moons for shakespearean 
characters juliet puck bianca cordelia cressida desdemona 
ophelia rosalind and portia the 10th will be named after belinda 
whose lock of hair was stolen in the rape of the lock 
the iau general assembly is certain to rubberstamp the proposal 
on the last day of its aug 211 meeting in baltimore md marsden 
said 
astronomers feel that even though the moons were discovered by 
the united states the satellites really are international 
therefore going along with tradition would have international 
acceptance marsden said by phone from cambridge mass 
naming features or moons is not the property of any one 
country masursky said 
of uranus five previously known moons oberon titania and 
miranda are shakespearean names umbriel is from popes poem while 
ariel is a name found in both the rape of the lock and 
shakespeares the tempest marsden said 
the craters to be named for challengers crew measure 20 to 60 
miles wide and are located in an enormous crater named apollo on 
the far side of the moon masursky said by phone from flagstaff

a drought that has dried up crops pastures and rivers will 
continue in the midwest for at least another month forecasters 
warned while crews today dredged the shallow mississippi and ohio 
rivers in hopes of freeing 1700 stranded barges 
showers and thunderstorms extended friday across parts of iowa 
kansas arkansas south dakota montana and the lower mississippi 
valley as well as parts of the southeast and the west 
but the widely scattered rain had little impact 
the drought continues basically national weather service 
meteorologist lyle alexander said today from kansas city mo the 
heart of the midwest will remain dry the areas that are most 
critical right now 
the weather service has predicted a continuation of the dry 
weather through at least july 15 with the possibility of a 20 
percent to 25 percent loss in corn yields compared with the 10 
percent loss suffered to date 
northeastern iowa needs 5 inches of rain to restore normal 
growing conditions and the rest of the state needs between 2 and 4 
inches iowa state extension climatologist elwynn taylor said some 
areas received up to an inch friday but most parts got less than a 
quarterinch alexander said 
early today over an inch of rain fell in the northcentral iowa 
communities of algona fort dodge and kanawha 
iowa ordered irrigators and other heavy water users along the 
winnebago english and little cedar rivers and a section of the 
cedar river to stop pumping water with officials saying similar 
bans are being considered to protect other lowflowing streams 
minnesota officials also suspended riverfed irrigation by 22 
farmers along the elk river which has dropped so low that a 
landowner reported hearing fish at night trying to flop their way 
through the river

extent of the damage before they write legislation to aid farmers 
six senators planned to tour the sunscorched wheat lands of 
montana and the dakotas this weekend 
usda officials reiterated that much of the wheat crop in those 
states already is severely damaged but that an inch or so of rain 
once a week for the rest of the growing season could save the 
midwests corn and soybean fields 
our guess is right now if we got rain in the next eight days 
yields for corn and soybeans would be off by 20 percent indiana 
lt gov john m mutz said friday on a visit to a dairy farm north 
of evansville 
if we dont get rain and we get into the dry season yields 
could be off 40 to 50 percent he said 
hundreds of barges sat idle friday on the mississippi and ohio 
rivers due to low water levels officials said sunday would be the 
earliest that safe travel could resume 
the mississippi is at its lowest levels since authorities began

britains expulsion of an israeli diplomat has 
put another crease in britishisraeli relations already torn by the 
controversy over israeli nuclear technician mordechai vanunu 
the current rift came over revelations that israels mossad 
secret service mounted a covert intelligence operation in england 
using a palestinian double agent british prosecutors said he spied 
on another palestinian wanted in connection with terrorist acts 
the mossad carried out the operation without informing british 
authorities of its activities or that the wanted man abder rahmane 
mustafa was living in britain 
the british foreign office announced friday it was expelling 
israeli diplomat arie regev because of activities incompatible 
with his diplomatic duties it gave no further explanation 
britain also expelled zaki al hawa a press officer at the 
palestine liberation organizations london office also without 
providing a reason 
israels foreign ministry issued a statement expressing regret 
that her majestys government has seen fit to take the measure of 
expelling an israeli diplomat israel did not act against any 
british interests 
two years ago british officials were angered over the 
disappearance from london of vanunu a former technician at 
israels nuclear plant in the southern town of dimona vanunu who 
has since been convicted in israel of espionage and treason 
provided the information for a threepage report by the sunday 
times of london on the jewish states nuclear arsenal 
although israel has never officially admitted it reports 
indicate that the mossad was responsible for vananus disappearance 
and subsequent abduction to israel he was reportedly lured to rome 
by a woman employed by the mossad then drugged and flown to israel 
the latest disclosures about the mossad were made during the 
trial of the doubleagent ismail hassan sowan sentenced thursday 
to 11 years in prison for possessing explosives and firearms 
sowan kept the weapons for mustapha who is suspected of 
involvement in a series of terrorist actions including the killing 
in london of arab cartoonist ali naji awad aladhami the times of 
london said an international arrest warrant had been issued for 
mustapha 
the current furor is the latest in relations between israel and 
britain which have been turbulent since even before the founding 
of israel 
jewish underground groups forces forced britain then the un 
mandatory power to leave palestine britain abstained in the un 
vote which led to israels establishment in 1948 and trained 
jordans army which fought israel during the 1948 middle east war 
relations warmed in the 1950s in 1956 israel france and 
britain formed an alliance to attack egypt after thenpresident 
gamel abdel nasser nationalized the suez canal 
britain imposed an arms embargo on israel at the outbreak of the 
1967 middle east war 
relations had again warmed over the past few years because of 
the reportedly close ties between foreign minister shimon peres and 
prime minister margaret thatcher

italianspeaking neighborhood authorities said both were hidden in 
trash cans

vienna where austria approved the agreement there were no 
casualties from those explosions 
police blamed them on germanspeaking extremists who want 
selfdetermination for the region there was no immediate word on

murder charges could be filed against stella 
nickell who was sentenced to 90 years in prison for the 
exceptional callousness and cruelty of putting cyanide in 
painrelief capsules that killed her husband and a stranger two 
years ago 
king county prosecutor norm maleng said he had waited until the 
sentencing friday to start a review of whether state murder charges 
would be filed against mrs nickell 
maleng said state laws against double jeopardy are stricter than 
the us constitutions protection but it was possible the state 
murder law and federal antiproduct tampering statute differ enough 
to allow prosecution 
at the sentencing us district judge william dwyer harshly 
criticized mrs nickell for the severity of her crimes 
the jury has found the defendant guilty of appalling crimes 
said dwyer who recommended mrs nickell 44 of suburban auburn 
not be eligible for parole for at least 30 years 
it will not be the first time behind bars for mrs nickell she 
spent six months in jail after she violated probation in orange 
county calif on a 1971 conviction for check fraud 
then known as stella strong she also was convicted of child 
beating in southern california in 1969 it could not be determined 
immediately what sentence she received 
the victim of the beating was her daughter cindy hamilton now 
28 who was the key witness in mrs nickells producttampering 
trial 
mrs nickell the first person brought to trial under a federal 
law dealing with death by product tampering appeared pale and 
unsmiling friday but did not otherwise respond when dwyer 
sentenced her she made no statement in court 
her attorney thomas hillier told dwyer she maintains her 
innocence and would appeal her conviction 
it must be said that these are crimes of exceptional 
callousness and cruelty dwyer said noting that poisoned 
capsules had been left on store shelves and could easily have lead 
to other deaths 
mrs nickell convicted may 9 received 90year terms on each of 
two counts of product tampering which killed her husband bruce 
nickell and susan katherine snow also of auburn 
she also was sentenced to 10year terms on each of three 
tampering counts for poisoning bottles of extrastrength excedrin 
and anacin found in the nickell home and on the shelves of area 
stores 
all terms were to run concurrently in addition dwyer levied a 
mandatory 250 minimum fine and said any of mrs nickells assets 
should be used to compensate her victims especially mrs snows 
family 
assistant us attorney joanne maida the prosecutor in the 
case said mrs nickell was indigent and the compensation issue was 
academic 
prosecutors had requested a 230year sentence with a minimum 67 
years before parole eligibility saying entire families could have 
died because of the tampering 
prosecutors alleged mrs nickell killed her husband because she 
was tired of him and wanted to collect 176000 in life insurance 
they said mrs snow who had no connection with the couple was an 
innocent victim of a plot to make nickells death appear the work 
of a random killer 
the deaths set off a nationwide tampering scare and caused 
excedrin manufacturer bristolmyers co to recall its 
nonprescription capsule medicines

federal health officials are proposing new 
regulations that would impose fines and other penalties on 
hospitals that turn away emergency room patients for fear they 
cant afford to pay 
a letter sent to hospital administrators states that when a 
patient comes to an emergency room the hospital must offer 
appropriate medical screening examinations to all individuals 
with emergency medical conditions and all women in active labor 
they may either stabilize the condition or provide a medically 
appropriate transfer to another facility when indicated unless the 
patient or their legal representative refuses treatment or 
transfer it says 
the letter was sent by health and humans services inspector 
general richard p kusserow medicare administrator william l 
roper and office for civil rights director audrey f morton 
the proposed new rules were published this week in the federal 
register and will become law after a period of public comment 
the letter warns that violating the law by refusing to accept 
emergency room patients can result in penalties of up to 50000 
civil lawsuits under state laws and suspension or exclusion from 
the medicare program 
the rules cover all patients not just those on medicare 
congress enacted legislation in 1986 to guard against instances 
in which hospitals were turning away women in labor and other 
patients in need of immediate care because they did not have money 
or insurance to pay for medical services

remembering their families back home one of them says

rica for an eightday fishing trip but was driven from land by a 
storm and ran out of gas before it could reach port 
the boat and its crew drifted 3600 miles across the pacific 
ocean according to coast guard spokesman jeff crawley 
obando 33 the only crewman who agreed to be interviewed said 
the five collected rainwater and caught enough food to stay healthy 
we lived on sharks fish even little fish and whatever 
else got near the boat obando said through an interpreter we 
had containers which we had ready all the time to catch rainwater 
dr martha hauk of the coast guard who examined the men before 
they left the kinei maru 128 said she was surprised to find them 
in nearperfect health 
they just look so good its amazing she said 
doctors at tripler army medical center also examined the men and 
said the five were in good shape and none would be hospitalized 
said hospital spokesman george vidis two of them were treated for 
mild dehydration and one was treated for an abscessed tooth he 
said 
obando said the storm struck jan 24 while the boat was three or 
four hours from shore 
the storm which obando said lasted more than two weeks knocked 
out the cairo iiis radio and the vessels motor failed in rough 
seas the boat ran out of fuel while trying to reach land after the 
storm broke 
supplies ran out after eight days at sea obando said they 
never went hungry but they went one or two days without water 
we were so thirsty we were licking the sides of the containers 
he said 
the crew fashioned a small makeshift sail that helped them move 
with the current obando said 
hilda richardson the costa rican consul in hawaii said the men 
would spend tonight in a hotel and probably be flown home sunday 
mrs richardson said she had informed families in costa rica 
that the fishermen had been found she said the man hadnt been 
able to speak with their families friday but probably would be 
able to telephone them before leaving honolulu 
tatsuo oyama captain of the kinei maru 128 said a lookout 
spotted the cairo iii with the men waving on its deck the men were 
rescued but the boat was left adrift 
the fishermen were identified as obando george fernandez 
castillo 22 pastor lopez rojas 30 joel omar gonzalez 27 and 
juan cernas bolivar 47 
obando said he and his crew all from puntarenas would return 
to fishing but first would spend time with their families

uniform steel tests could prevent fractures in 
thousands of aging oil storage tanks from causing spills similar to 
one in pennsylvania this year that contaminated the water supply in 
three states a government report said 
the absence of steel toughness standards until 1963 and the 
failure to comply with todays standards when rebuilding tanks 
means that thousands of tanks in existence today could be 
susceptible to a brittle fracture like this one rep doug 
walgren dpa said friday 
walgren requested the investigation by the commerce departments 
national bureau of standards after the jan 2 collapse of an 
ashland petroleum co tank near pittsburgh 
the ashland tank split open as it was being filled with 38 
million gallons of oil pouring an estimated 713000 gallons into 
the monongahela and ohio rivers the spill forced communities in 
pennsylvania ohio and west virginia to close their drinking water 
intakes leaving about 23000 suburban pittsburgh residents without 
tap water for almost a week 
the report confirmed ashlands statements earlier this year that 
the spill resulted from a dimesized flaw in the nearly 50yearold 
steel wall of the 4milliongallon container the wall was 
assembled in 1940 dismantled and reconstructed at the companys 
floreffe terminal south of pittsburgh in 1986 the company noted 
walgren said ashland oil by using old steel in reconstructing 
the tank avoided industry standards in effect when the storage 
facility was erected in 1986 
the report demonstrates that we must not only question the 
safety of most tanks in the united states but we must also develop 
new testing techniques to assess the quality of existing tanks 
he said 
if the steel is tough enough the report said normal 
spillcontrol measures will confine the spread of the contents and 
the tank can be repaired all without catastrophic consequences 
the ashland tank did not meet current nationally recognized 
standards for fracture toughness and the welds in the tanks while 
not contributing to the split did not conform to current standards 
and only served to make the metal around the flaw more brittle the 
report said 
safety concerns regarding the older tanks currently in use can 
be alleviated if there is documentation indicating the steel meets 
sufficient toughness provisions the report said 
for those tanks lacking sufficient toughness the bureau 
suggested remedial actions including installing special crack 
arresters converting the tank to a higher temperature use or 
retiring the tank 
the report also stressed the need for standard testing and 
evaluation procedures to assess the fracture safety of tanks made 
from inadequately documented steel

the finance director of rupert murdochs 
media empire says his statement that the company would shut down 
the fox television network if it continues to lose money was taken 
out of context 
news corp executive richard sarazen said thursday at a meeting 
of securities analysts in new york that fox was losing 80 million 
annually 
if it doesnt improve dramatically in the next six months 
well close it down the financial newspaper investors daily 
quoted sarazen as saying 
on friday sarazen said his remarks had been taken out of 
context and no timetable for success has been delivered to fox 
executives according to a statement given to los angeles fox 
affiliate kttv by brad turrel vice president of publicity for fox 
broadcasting corp 
billed as the nations fourth network fox was created in 
1986 to compete with nbc abc and cbs 
its sunday lineup including the tracey ullman show and 
its gary shandlings show has been doing relatively well in 
the ratings but saturday nights programs have lagged behind 
according to sarazen assurances that saturday night ratings 
would climb have cost the network money as advertisers receive free 
rebroadcasts of commercials to reach promised audience numbers 
sarazen said news corp expected to lose about 50 million a 
year in starting the venture the report said fox has 125 
affiliate stations 
the executive said the company would hold onto the fox 
television stations regardless of what happens to the network he 
said news corp would consider turning the network into a 
syndicator of programming focusing largely on reruns of shows with 
a smattering of original movies or series

the first of 6000 people evacuated 
from neighborhoods choked by a chlorine gas cloud began returning 
to their homes today after a chemical fire at a supply plant was 
brought under control 
at least 125 people were treated overnight for injuries from the 
gas cloud but none was admitted hospital supervisors said in 
addition 13 firefighters were treated and released for exposure to 
fumes or chemical burns 
two high schools and a hospital were turned into shelters for 
the evacuees among them scores of nursing home residents and some 
800 methodists attending an annual weekend meeting at springfield 
college fire department spokesman giorgio placanico said 
i dont really believe it happened even though im trained as 
a chemist and know the dangers of chlorine said elizabeth lurie 
55 of leominster as she waited to return to the dormitory room 
she left just before midnight friday 
fire officials said the gas cloud was still hanging over a small 
section of the evacuated area today and it would be hours before 
some residents could return to their homes the fire was brought 
under control at 315 am 
police wearing gas masks patrolled the area 
the fire that spawned the chlorine gas cloud was one of two at 
the threestory advanced laboratories plant friday 
investigators believed the two fires were unrelated but arson 
has not been ruled out fire commissioner anthony pellegrino said 
a police cruiser making a routine drive through the area 
reported the fire about 11 pm placanico said 
at least 100 firefighters some wearing oxygen tanks and gas 
masks worked to extinguish the blaze 
people were evacuated in buses from neighborhoods near the fire 
about half of those evacuated went to the three shelters while the 
others fled to the homes of relatives or friends 
the cloud of chlorine gas had a radius of at least a half mile 
officials said 
the first fire began shortly after 10 am when rain from an 
early morning thunderstorm apparently blew through an open window 
onto chlorine dust and into a chlorine hopper at the plant 
sparking a chemical reaction sullivan said 
firefighters using soda ash quickly extinguished the flames but 
as the fumes began to spread in the hot muggy air authorities 
evacuated all homes businesses and schools within a quarter mile 
of the plant as a precautionary measure he said residents were 
allowed to return two hours later before being evacuated again

election in the allahabad district singh had 54 percent to 24 
percent for his nearest challenger singer and film writer sunil 
shastri

independent with the backing of several opposition parties 
by early evening today the 56yearold singh had 163058 of the 
300000 votes counted shastri 38 had 71868 the rest were 
divided among 66 other candidates 
gandhi was quoted by indian news agency reporters as saying that 
the election results were not unexpected 
the ruling party gets it in its neck in offyear elections 
gandhi was quoted as saying the congress is satisfied over the 
outcome of the polls as it has come at a difficult time 
about 850000 people were eligible to vote but election workers 
estimated only about 50 percent turned out 
the allahabad contest was one of seven special parliamentary 
elections conducted thursday by this morning the congress party 
had captured one seat and opposition parties had two 
votes were still being counted in three other constituencies 
including allahabad in the seventh district in haryana state the 
count has not begun because of reports of ballotstuffing 
in state legislative elections also conducted thursday the 
congress party took five seats and opposition parties won five 
votecounting was stayed in an 11th contest in haryana state 
because of the ballotstuffing charges 
the contest in allahabad 360 miles southeast of new delhi

later than january 1990 
singh who campaigned on an anticorruption platform was a 
member of gandhis congress party until last summer when he broke 
with the prime minister and quit the cabinet over the governments 
hesitation to investigate corruption 
as defense minister singh wanted to look into allegations that 
kickbacks were paid to purchase bofors artillery guns from sweden 
and submarines from west germany 
according to indian press reports the kickbacks were paid to 
government officials and friends of gandhi gandhi himself was 
never accused of wrongdoing and a parliamentary report later said 
it had uncovered no irregularities

catholics in central vietnam have been 
told not to celebrate the vaticans canonization sunday of 
vietnamese martyrs which hanoi has condemned as politically 
motivated vietnams official radio hanoi said 
pope john paul ii is to preside over the canonization of 117 
martyrs the largest in church history at st peters basilica in 
the vatican thousands of vietnamese many of whom fled their 
communist homeland are expected to attend and hanoi fears it will 
become a widely publicized anticommunist rally 
the radio said thursday that bishop huynh dong cat of qui nhon 
diocese in central nghia binh province sent a june 11 letter to 
priests and lay followers instructing them not to mark the occasion 
it said cat wrote the letter a day after the the provincial 
peoples committee or government invited him for a meeting 
and outlined the official stand on the issue 
a text of the broadcast was obtained from a western embassy in 
bangkok today 
the broadcast said the letter noted that sunday also is the day 
the government of south vietnam had celebrated its army communists 
defeated the south vietnam government in april 1975 and reunified 
vietnam 
the vatican has said the timing of the ceremony is coincidental 
the letter continued on that day you brothers and sisters 
can go to churches as usual however you should not organize 
canonization masses hoist banners make decorations and hold 
meetings or engage in any illegal activities at your churches that 
could be exploited by bad elements to disrupt public order and 
security 
refugees and others said that since 1975 vietnam has closed 
seminaries and taken other steps to systematically repress 
catholicism in the largely buddhist nation but new vietnamese 
leadership has taken steps over the past two years to allow more 
religious freedom

ayatollah ruhollah khomeini appeared on 
iranian television saturday two days after reports surfaced that 
the 87yearold iranian leader was dead 
khomeini was shown at a meeting of volunteer guards at the 
jamaran mosque near his home in northern tehran 
the television report showed khomeini sitting to one side of a 
podium as ali mohammed rahmani head of the volunteer guards 
discussed the united states impending 19 billion arms sale to 
kuwait and other issues 
at the end of the meeting khomeini got slowly out of his chair 
and lifted his right hand to acknowledge the cheers of the guards 
he did not speak and appeared weak but he moved without 
assistance the broadcast was monitored in nicosia 
a british television station reported thursday that an exiled 
iranian writer in paris thought khomeini was dead because of 
unusual movements of officials in tehran and because international 
phone lines had been shut off 
oil prices jumped sharply on new york financial markets in late 
trading thursday in response to rumors that khomeini had died 
the iranian embassy in paris immediately denied the report 
khomeinis rare appearance saturday also reported by tehran radio 
apparently was organized to undermine the rumors 
a spokesman for the iranian resistance in a telephone interview 
from washington said the iranian government had orchestrated the 
rumors of khomeinis death to distract people from irans recent 
setbacks in the nearly 8yearold war with iraq

an escaped convict shot and wounded 
premier turgut ozal on saturday police said moments after ozal 
urged his country to reject violence twentyone people including 
the gunman were injured when police opened fire and the crowd 
stampeded 
ozal 61 was shot in the right hand and slightly wounded as he 
gave the opening speech at the convention of his governing 
motherland party 
we have a more civilized atmosphere now people of different 
views can now talk to each other instead of fighting or drawing 
their guns ozal said before the first shot struck the 
microphone a second bullet hit ozal 
police fired at the assailant and hit him in the arm 
scores of people ran screaming as shots rang out sixteen 
suffered bullet wounds and four were bruised in the stampede 
prosecutor cemal ozer who interviewed the gunman in a hospital 
identified him as kartal demirag 32 and said he escaped from the 
mugla prison in western turkey six months ago 
ankara governor saffet arikan beduk said demirag had just begun 
serving a 10year sentence for attempted murder when he fled the 
lowsecurity prison 
earlier the associated press erroneously quoted ozer as saying 
demirag was serving time for murder 
authorities had not established a motive for the attack ozer 
said 
turkish news agencies reported responsibility claims from the 
outlawed kurdish labor party and another group called the 
revolutionary officers organization 
none of the claims could be confirmed independently 
the kurdish labor party is fighting for an independent marxist 
state in parts of eastern and southeastern turkey about onefifth 
of turkeys 52 million people are ethnic kurds 
the assassination attempt occurred three days after ozal 
returned from a historic visit to greece turkeys longtime enemy 
police said demirag a schoolteacher stayed in a hotel near the 
convention hall under the name of hayati ipek on friday night 
beduk said police were investigating demirags possible political 
affiliations 
police took into custody about 50 people many of whom helped 
decorate the convention hall to determine whether any smuggled 
demirags weapon into the building turkish news agencies reported 
police and witnesses said demirag was standing a few yards from 
the lectern in a group of news photographers when he fired beduk 
said demirags gun jammed after he shot twice at ozal 
interior minister mustafa kalemli a physician quickly wrapped 
a white cloth around ozals wound 
as blood seeped through the bandage ozal returned to the 
lectern and declared no one can take away the life given by god 
except god himself 
the crowd jumped to its feet and applauded 
ozal ducked behind the lectern when he heard the shots the 
anatolia news agency said 
i saw the gunman take careful aim at the premier and fire at 
him twice eyup asik a deputy chairman of the party told the 
agency 
ozals doctor cengis aslan told reporters a bullet entered 
ozals hand through the right thumb and exited from the palm 
the premier received three stitches and returned to the 
convention hall three hours after the 1215 pm attack later 
delegates reelected ozal chairman of the party there were no 
other candidates 
ozal was first elected when a military government ceded power in 
1983 
the motherland party was founded six months before elections in 
november 1983 that restored civilian rule in turkey 
in general elections seven months ago ozals party received 290 
of the seats in the 450seat legislature 
but in recent months ozals popularity waned because of 
inflation which is running at 75 percent recent public opinion 
polls have showed support for him at 25 percent down from the 36 
percent of votes he received in the elections 
in his speech saturday ozal defended austerity measures put in 
place to battle inflation he pledged to cut inflation in half 
within a year 
the attack on ozal came minutes after he stressed the importance 
of political stability he said that the last 10 years in which 
political terrorism claimed 5000 lives and prompted military 
intervention in 1980 were a lost decade for turkey 
beduk said that of the 16 bystanders wounded by gunfire two 
required surgery but were in satisfactory condition police didnt 
say if they were hit by police gunfire 
ozal returned to turkey on wednesday from a threeday visit to 
greece the first by a turkish premier in 36 years 
no solutions to major disputes between greece and turkey emerged 
from the talks with greek premier andreas papandreou but both 
leaders said they were resolved to continue the dialogue 
the longtime enemies have clashed over several issues including 
the aegean sea and the island of cyprus in march 1987 greece and 
turkey came to the brink of war over oildrilling rights in the 
aegean seabed 
one of the first messages of regret about saturdays attack came 
from papandreou in a telegram the greek leader said i hope you 
will continue your governments creative work and the nowar course 
we initiated in our countries bilateral relations with new energy 
and health 
indian prime minister rajiv gandhi who is to pay a state visit 
to turkey next month expressed deep shock at the attempt on 
ozals life 
your calmness and fortitude in continuing your speech to the 
motherland party congress was admirable gandhi said in a

city officials are investigating why it took 
paramedics at least 40 minutes to reach a man who collapsed and 
later died after an endurance test for wouldbe firefighters 
the grueling test which was to have been taken by 28000 people 
seeking jobs as firefighters has been halted indefinitely while 
officials try to determine what caused freddy padilla to die and 
seven others to become ill 
padilla 24 collapsed june 11 after completing the sevenminute 
test he died seven hours after arriving at st lukesroosevelt 
medical center it was unclear whether a faster response by the 
emergency medical service might have saved his life 
according to magda gandasegui a spokeswoman for the city 
personnel department padilla finished the test about 1230 pm he 
apparently reported feeling ill and was looked at by a fire 
lieutenant trained as an emergency medical technician who took 
his pulse and checked his breathing she said 
records show that the lieutenant called ems at 1240 pm and 
asked for an ambulance according to ems spokeswoman donna osso 
she said a crew arrived at 1253 pm but told the ems dispatcher 
that it could not find the patient the assignment was canceled as 
unfounded 
the record also shows that at 107 pm the lieutenant called 
ems again to ask where the ambulance was ms osso said this time 
the lieutenant told the ems commander to send the ambulance to an 
entrance to the building on west 58th street and to use the 
elevator entrance 
the ems commander relayed the message to the ems dispatcher but 
did not mention the elevator entrance the dispatcher sent the same 
crew 
at 120 pm ms osso said the ambulance crew called the 
dispatcher to say that they still could not find the patient 
sometime after that the crew reached padilla who was conscious 
and talking when they arrived she said adding there was no record 
of exactly when the crew found him 
twenty minutes after the crew reached him padilla was taken to 
the hospital where he died shortly before 9 pm according to 
ellen borakove a spokeswoman for the medical examiner 
autopsy results were inconclusive and further tests were needed 
to determine the cause of death ms borakove said 
the other seven firefighter candidates who became ill after the 
test were taken to st lukesroosevelt where three were admitted 
and two remained hospitalized in good condition saturday according 
to hospital spokeswoman judy murphy 
ms murphy said the patients were treated for mildtomoderate 
kidney disorders caused by physical exertion 
the department began testing may 31 and was scheduled to finish 
in july more than 5000 candidates have finished the test ms 
gandasegui said 
candidates are required to sign a statement certifying that they 
are in good physical condition but are not required to have a 
physical exam before taking the test 
during the test wouldbe firefighters wearing 40 pounds of 
gear scale walls carry a 145pound dummy break down a door and 
drag 57 pounds of hose 
it is not unusual for people to feel wobbly or vomit after 
taking the test ms gandasegui said

refugee camp was hit in the lungs and listed in critical 
condition the official said he gave no other details 
saturdays unrest came after the proiranian fundamentalist 
group islamic jihad called on palestinians to strike and hold 
demonstrations to mark the hanging of three arabs on june 18 1930 
the three were hanged by british authorities who controlled 
what was then known as palestine they were accused of involvement 
in the massacre of a group of jews near the wailing wall in 
jerusalem 
in the khan yunis refugee camp in the gaza strip palestinians 
burned tires and attacked israeli troops with rocks and firebombs 
an arab reporter and israeli radio said 
a military spokesman said the troops opened fire killing 
17yearold khaled al haj yussuf with a shot to the chest two 
other arabs were wounded he said 
the death brought to 210 the number of palestinians killed since 
the arab uprising broke out on dec 8 two israelis a soldier and 
a teenage girl have died in the violence 
in arab east jerusalem police arrested 19 palestinians after 
the protesters took over two main streets in the commercial 
district pelting israeli vehicles with rocks burning tires and 
smashing the windows of a police van police spokesman rafi levy 
said the violence was the first in jerusalems arab neighborhoods 
in four months 
protesters also threw rocks at an army lookout post atop the 
damascus gate one of the northern entrances to the old walled 
city 
a senior city official told the ap the riot was organized by 
palestinian agitators from the gaza strip as a part of the islamic 
jihads memorial day protest 
jerusalem was rocked by widespread demonstrations in january and 
february 
saturdays firebombings were the latest in a mounting series of 
such attacks on israeli soldiers and civilians 
the army has initiated a series of measures to curb the attacks 
defense minister yitzhak rabin gave soldiers and civilians 
permission to shoot on sight at firebombthrowers 
last week a military court sentenced to 10 years in jail a 
palestinian convicted of throwing a firebomb at israeli soldiers 
on thursday and friday the army demolished the homes of seven 
alleged firebomb throwers 
maj gen amram mitzna commander of israeli forces in the west 
bank told israel radio the firebomb attacks presented a 
complicated problem with no simple or immediate solution because 
any child can prepare a firebomb with very primitive means that can 
easily be found in the home 
he warned that palestinians may escalate their rebellion by 
resorting to firearms and explosives in the next phase of the 
uprising

marketing seeds planted by florists transworld 
delivery association during the last five years are beginning to 
bloom with an increasing number of men getting flowers for fathers 
day 
its not that unusual these days to have people coming in the 
store to buy flowers for fathers day whereas a couple of years 
ago i might have lifted an eyebrow if someone asked about flowers 
for dad said john adamo of conner park florists in detroit 
over the past five years flowersbywire orders for fathers 
day have more than doubled from about 25200 to 55200 said henry 
knitter group director of corporate services for ftd based at 
southfield mich 
the association has spent approximately 100 million on 
advertising since 1983 20 percent of that promoting the idea of 
giving flowers to men knitter said 
ftd says commercials featuring merlin olsen a former pro 
football player turned actor are part of the reason for the rise 
in popularity of flowers on fathers day olsen has been the ftd 
spokesman since 1983 
he olsen has a macho image yet also comes across as a 
gentle giant knitter said 
flowers are just another alternative as dad gets a little 
older and it seems like he has everything adamo said 
despite a gain in acceptance many potential fathers day flower 
buyers still are concerned that they will hurt a mans macho psyche 
by giving him flowers florists said 
were doing a lot of manly looking designs like red 
carnations said mary griffin of greenhaus florists in traverse 
city 
red was the most popular floral color for dad while orchids 
were the least suggested gift idea florists said 
but despite the growing popularity of sending a daffodil or two 
to dad fathers day has a long way to go before challenging 
mothers day florists said knitter said sales on mothers day 
outnumber those on fatherss day by a 16to1 margin 
theres absolutely no comparison knitter said mothers 
day is the biggest day of the year for florists

two years after united technologies was 
investigated for its pentagon dealings the giant defense 
contractor again finds itself in the middle of a probe involving 
allegations of fraud and bribery 
this time the focus is on united technologies hiring of melvyn 
paisley a former top navy official who resigned in april 1987 
and began working as a consultant 
united technologies was among the major defense contractors who 
quickly signed up paisley had knowledge and access two of 
washingtons most prized commodities 
the latest investigation comes at a time when united 
technologies the nations eighthlargest defense contractor has 
regained status as a hot property drexel burnham lambert said 
earlier this year that united technologies will be the best stock 
to own in the aerospacedefense group in 1988 
asked to comment on the investigation larry bingaman a 
spokesman for united technologies said saturday were 
cooperating fully with the investigation because the investigation 
is ongoing we cant comment further 
based in hartford conn united technologies is a conglomerate 
built during the 15year reign of the acquisitionminded harry gray 
when gray took over in 1972 the company was known as united 
aircraft products inc and it was chiefly known for pratt amp 
whitney one of the nations prime builders of jet engines and 
sikorsky which produces helicopters 
in 1981 gray then chairman and chief executive officer hired 
alexander haig as the companys president a move that seemed 
logical given the firms status as a major pentagon supplier and 
haigs background as the former commander of nato and a top 
national security official during the previous republican 
presidencies 
haig didnt last long leaving only a year after he began 
attempts to reach haig and gray were unsuccessful neither man 
returned calls to his office 
gray stepped down 18 months ago and was succeeded by robert f 
daniell who began a series of layoffs and sales of some 
businesses moves designed to improve productivity daniels 
actions have won him praise on wall street 
united technologies sales rose to 172 billion last year 
compared to 157 billion in 1986 profits zoomed from 73 million 
in 1986 to 592 million last year earnings per share also rocketed 
up from 54 cents in 1986 to 452 in 1987 
part of the overhaul involved pratt amp whitney which was 
reorganized in an effort to try to reclaim a larger share of the 
market in its longrunning fight against general electric the 
nations other major builder of aircraft engines 
that competition is fought on two major battlefields 
commercial sales and military contracts 
last october japan air lines picked general electric over pampw 
for a purchase of new engines and pampw officials admitted the sale 
was lost because of pampw problems in providing timely support for 
oldermodel engines 
the same problem had caused pampw headaches three years ago in its 
dealings with the air force long the largest customer for pampw 
engines 
pratt amp whitney had been the sole source for engines for the 
f15 and f16 jets the services topoftheline fighters but 
there were numerous complaints from the service that the company 
was too slow to fix problems 
eventually the air force turned to general electric and has 
given ge about half its engine business the past three years 
in 1986 the justice department ended a fouryear investigation 
into charges that pampw had charged 22 million worth of questionable 
billings to the pentagon from 1979 to 1984 
the allegedly excessive billings covered country club 
memberships political contributions private planes professional 
football tickets and even halloween costumes 
but federal prosecutors decided against bringing charges because 
they said the government regulations were so vague and complicated 
that it couldnt be determined which pampw expenses were reimbursable 
the firm eventually turned the tables on ge on the navys 
fa18 the plane designed to be the services top fighterbomber 
for the rest of the century 
ge had been providing engines for the fa18 but pampw at the 
navys request built a prototype engine to compete for the 
business and was eventually approved by the navy as a second 
contractor 
in the past years pampw has won 316 million worth of contracts 
to build engines for the fa18 
at the same time pampw also moved in as a second builder of 
engines for the v22 osprey a tiltrotor jet being developed for 
the marines and the navy ge had originally been the sole source 
for v22 engines 
during the time the decisions were made on those two navy 
planes paisley was a top official of the service he was the 
assistant secretary of the navy for research engineering and 
systems 
when he left the navy paisley was hired by united technologies 
chiefly as a consultant on pampws efforts to sell the 404 engine for 
the fa18 and the engine for the v22 according to sources who 
declined to be identified

house speaker jim wright under scrutiny by 
the house ethics committee told a a prayer breakfast gathering 
saturday to support democracy by buying american and paying taxes 
we say how bad it is this trade deficit but how often do we 
wake up in the morning and look at our swiss watch and turn on our 
sony then go to work and talk about the trade deficit the texas 
democrat said 
mayor tom bradley a friend and political ally of wright 
invited the speaker to give the keynote address at the annual 
mayors prayer breakfast 
we come not to judge political leaders but to pray for them 
so they can make the right decisions not the politically expedient 
ones bradley said 
wright was shielded by aides after the speech and would not 
answer reporters questions 
the house committee on standards of official conduct voted 
unanimously june 11 to look into six areas in which wright 
allegedly used his position to benefit himself and certain 
associates financially 
the ethics accusations against wright involve a book publishing 
deal in which he received 55 percent of the royalties from a 
paperback published by a friend who did work on wrights campaigns 
he is also being investigated for possibly lobbying on behalf of 
oil companies in which he may have had an interest and for 
pressuring federal officials on behalf of texas bankers 
wright has repeatedly said he is innocent 
actor dean jones who presided over the breakfast asked the 
group to include wright in their prayers 
i want all of those who will pray at least once a week for one 
year for the honorable jim wright to raise your hand jones said 
most of the audience of 1900 responded 
wright urged the group to support the principle of paying taxes 
how many of us have wanted all the services of government and 
not wanted to pay taxes for them wright said 
the audience responded with cries of amen and hallelujah 
wright read passages from the bible and expounded on forgiveness 
its hard to be forgiven it tears down our defense system if 
someone forgives you you lose your pride he said 
as an example wright cited jose napolean duarte the terminally 
ill president of el salvador which has been torn by eight years of 
civil war 
he called upon the enemies of that country and said ill 
grant you amnesty and amnesty means i forgive you wright 
said of duarte who was recently diagnosed as having cancer

greece on friday blocked a farmprice 
compromise that took european economic community ministers three 
months to reach but officials said hopes remained that a solution 
could still be found 
the austere farm package calls for price freezes or cuts to keep 
the eecs 198889 farm budget within a 335 billion ceiling 
imposed by eec leaders at a summit last february 
officials said the greek agricultural minister yannis potakis 
threatened to veto the package that had been accepted by his 11 eec 
partners if ignaz kiechle the west german delegate and the 
meetings chairman put it to a vote 
potakis claimed a price boost for greek farmers would not cost 
the eec budget as much as calculated and asked for higher prices 
for greek farmers 
the eec commission that drafted the farm budget acknowledged its 
calculations might not be correct but said it could not change the 
entire price scheme to which 11 countries agreed it said other 
members would ask for additional changes and thus undermine the 
package 
a new meeting may be called while the commission studies 
possible concessions to greece 
the agriculture ministers began their meeting last monday 
throughout the negotiations the commission made concessions to 
various demands by agreeing to a gradual dismantling of a complex 
system of taxes on exports of farm produce from countries with 
weaker currencies 
kiechle could call for another farm ministers meeting before his 
sixmonth term as chairman expires on june 30 officials said

ammunition and money seized during a raid on a red brigade hideout 
and said the items may provide answers in four killings and an 
armored car robbery 
prosecutors said ballistics tests could determine if nine 
suspects accused of being red brigade members used the weapons to 
kill former us diplomat leaman r hunt italian sen roberto 
ruffilli economist ezio tarantelli and former florence mayor lando 
conti 
an antiterrorist squad of the carabinieri italys elite 
paramilitary police discovered the hideout wednesday after a 
twoyear investigation 
five men and four women were arrested after the raid on charges 
of illegal possession of weapons and participating in an armed 
band a blanket charge often used against terrorists

and assassinations culminating in the 1978 murder of former prime 
minister aldo moro

scorpion submachine gun two other automatic weapons a pistol a

faithful members of the mormon church have 
toiled in this remote mississippi river town for a quarter century 
to patch together broken reminders of their tumultuous history 
the estimated 20 million restoration project in nauvoo is 
nearing completion the church announced earlier this month it 
would spend about 750000 on one more major undertaking 
restoration of the old jail in nearby carthage where church founder 
joseph smith and his brother hyrum were killed in 1844 
the jail is one of the most sacred spots for 65 million members 
of the mormon faith worldwide its restoration begins as the church 
prepares for the 150th anniversary next year of its followers 
settlement in illinois 
my orders are to make the jail the most beautiful site in 
carthage said jim taylor who manages the nauvoo restoration 
site this is where joseph smith sealed his testimony he never 
denied it and its a sacred spot for our church 
when that project is done the restoration of nauvoo will be 
over for the most part 
taylor 63 is an electrical engineer a lawyer and recently 
retired president of utah power and light a company with 3 
billion in assets and 1 billion in annual revenue 
taylor also is fairly typical of the people who come to nauvoo 
each year to live and work on a labor of love the restoration of a 
town that was envisioned as the home of the mormon church 
we are trying to tell the story of the life of joseph smith 
here and acquaint people with our church taylor said people 
come here for the historical experience of seeing a town as it 
looked in 1839 and they learn that we really arent any different 
from them 
for mormons its a special place we encourage all mormons to 
come to nauvoo and feel the spirit of the place they can see the 
sacrifices made by their parents and grandparents and they can 
actually see where joseph smith and the others walked and talked 
lived and died 
about 100000 visitors a year travel to nauvoo and find an 
impressive assortment of restored brick and log homes shops and 
other buildings in the town of about 1100 residents 200 miles 
north of st louis about 40000 people a year also visit the jail 
at carthage 23 miles southeast of nauvoo

a number of hotels shops and businesses in the business district 
nauvoo offers quaint bedandbreakfast inns historic old hotels 
and novelty shops 
modern visitors centers offer displays of mormon history 
artifacts and films on the town and its link to smith brigham 
young and the church 
the mormon settlement is on 1000 acres in the flats below 
nauvoos main business district and was swamp land when smith and 
his congregation arrived in 1839 the land was drained and each 
resident was given an acre for a house barn and a few animals 
within a few years a city of 15000 sprang from the swamp 
rivaling chicago as the largest city in illinois and construction 
of a huge limestone temple began on a bluff overlooking the town 
however the friction with nonbelievers that forced smith out 
of palmyra ny kirtland ohio and independence mo dogged the 
settlers into illinois 
church members clashed with nonbelievers who rejected smiths 
claims that he had spoken with god been visited by angels and was 
a prophet the conflict eventually led to smiths death at the 
hands of a mob that shot him and his brother to death on june 27 
1844 in the carthage jail 
brigham young assumed the leadership of the church officially 
the church of jesus christ of latterday saints and two years 
later led a mass exodus from nauvoo taking church followers west 
to their eventual settlement in salt lake city

vice president george bush on saturday 
accused democrat michael dukakis of being soft on criminals for 
supporting a massachusetts program letting inmates including 
murderers out of prison on weekends 
what did the democratic governor of massachusetts think he was 
doing when he let convicted firstdegree murderers out on weekend 
passes said bush the all but certain republican presidential 
nominee even after one of the criminals brutally raped a woman 
and stabbed her fiance why didnt he admit his mistake 
bush who was touring the droughtdamaged midwest issued his 
sharpest attack so far on dukakis over the prison furlough issue 
i think gov dukakis owes the people of the united states an 
explanation for why he supported this outrageous program bush 
told the illinois state republican convention 
bush told his audience that at least one woman was raped as a 
result of the prison furlough program 
eight months later he was still defending his program bush 
said of his democratic rival for the white house and only when 
the massachusetts legislature voted by an overwhelming majority to 
abolish the program for murders did he finally give in 
in april dukakis signed a bill banning furloughs for 
firstdegree murders the bill was prompted by a public outcry over 
the rape which occurred last year in maryland 
we dont let murderers out on vacation to terrorize innocent 
people bush said 
the dukakis campaign accused bush of misrepresenting the facts 
george bush should know better dukakis press secretary 
dayton duncan said while traveling with the candidate in texas 
he should check the record of ronald reagan as california 
governor the federal system in his own administration and of 22 
states with republican governors before he makes more wild 
accusations about furlough systems 
bush accompanied by agriculture secretary richard e lyng and 
illinois gov james thompson visited a droughtstricken farm 
where corn plants were parched and little more than anklehigh 
we need two inches of rain before two weeks this corn is 
hurting the farmer raymond poe told bush 
the vice president in his shirtsleeves sat on a bale of hay 
and discussed the drought with a group of local farmers 
ive learned how serious this problem is of drought and the 
kind of suffering it can cause in the farm community bush said 
but he didnt hold out much in the way of federal help 
there are serious budget restraints on what the federal 
government can do he said 
the vice president insisted that his farm visit added to the 
schedule at the last minute was not politically motivated 
thats absolutely absurd he said weve got a national 
problem and im the vice president of the united states when 
agricultural america is hurting of course we care 
lyng meanwhile said that while the drought was clearly a 
serious problem for us farmers a drought in an election year 
is worse than a drought in a nonelection year 
people overreact lyng told a group of reporters at andrews 
air force base near washington as he prepared to board air force 
two with bush for the flight to illinois 
with people running for office you get a sense of added 
urgency lyng said 
the agriculture secretary said he did not mean to imply the 
drought was not a major one its a real drought he said 
asked what measures the government might take to aid farmers 
lyng said weve tried about all we think we can do in terms of 
emergency steps except money and its too early to consider 
that 
what you really need is rain and theres no way you can bring 
that he said 
thompson speaking with reporters said farmers arent

the exclusive allmale cosmos club breaking 
with its 110year history voted overwhelmingly saturday to accept 
women as members its president announced 
tedson j meyers the clubs president told a news conference 
that the club membership voted almost unanimously about 98 
percent as best as the eye can tell to begin accepting the 
names of women for nomination he said shortly after the vote the 
names of four women were submitted 
this is truly an exciting period for the club said meyers 
while standing outside the clubs mansion on embassy row on 
massachusetts avenue 
the club whose members once included supreme court justices 
oliver wendell holmes and louis d brandeis twice before in 1973 
and 1975 rejected petitions by members to permit women into the 
club which was founded by geologist john wesley powell in 1878 
this time however the clubs leadership its officers and board 
of management made the proposal 
we the officers are amazed surprised and delighted by the 
outcome said meyers a lawyer and former member of the city 
council in washington we knew there was a changing mood among 
the membership but did not know it would be so overwhelming 
he said on a standing vote only 14 of the 800 members attending 
voted against the admission of women we stopped counting when we 
got to 700 meyers said 
last fall the washington human rights office ruled that there 
is probable cause to believe that the clubs menonly policy 
violates the citys antidiscrimination law the office was ready 
to order public hearings on the case which could have resulted in 
the loss of all city licenses and permits if the allmale policy 
had continued 
meyers said although the legal issues confronting the club may 
have been a catalyst the great majority of members do not believe 
that the membership policy of this club is a legal issue rather 
the issues are ethical and moral they related to social changes 
members individually could accept or ignore as they prefer 
the question for us has never been whether the club may remain 
a club for men but rather whether it should remain a club for 
men he said such a question should be resolved not in the 
courthouse but in the clubhouse for us it has and we are proud of 
that 
meyers said the club has a limit of 2500 residential and 
nonresidential members who pay 900 a year and 450 a year 
respectively in dues there is also a category for senior and 
emeritus members for which there is no limit on the numbers 
meyers said the club has between 3000 to 3100 members down 
several hundred in recent years there are 350 vacancies within the 
2500 authorized slots but he said the limit could be raised if 
the members choose to do so 
women candidates will have to qualify in one of the three 
categories that men do to be recognized in science literature or 
the arts wellcultivated in any any of those areas or 
distinguished in a learned profession or public service 
i believe we all know women who can qualify said meyers 
as a matter of fact i have one and am just waiting for her to 
fill out the necessary forms 
up until now female guests of members as well as wives and 
widows of members and former members were allowed to dine in the 
downstairs dining rooms but women were not allowed in the 
secondfloor members dining room except on thursday and friday 
evenings and weekends 
a person must be nominated by a member the club does not 
recruit nor can a candidate apply uninvited be cosponsored by 
another member and have four supporters to be eligible

vice president george bush launched a sharp attack saturday 
against massachusetts gov michael dukakis whom he accused of 
coddling criminals by allowing some convicts out of prison on 
weekends 
the likely nominees of the republican and democratic parties 
spent the day working to shore up support in parts of the country 
where each is considered weakest dukakis in the south and bush in 
the midwest 
we dont let murderers out on vacation to terrorize innocent 
people bush said at the illinois republican convention in 
springfield 
even after one of the criminals brutally raped a woman and 
stabbed her fiance why didnt he dukakis admit his mistake 
bush said 
bushs attack saturday came three weeks after a strategy session 
during which the vice presidents campaign indicated dukakis would 
be confronted directly on domestic issues and his management record 
as governor of massachusetts 
reaction from the dukakis campaign came quickly on saturday 
george bush should know better dukakis press secretary 
dayton duncan said while traveling with the candidate in texas 
he should check the record of ronald reagan as california 
governor the federal system in his own administration and of 22 
states with republican governors before he makes more wild 
accusations about furlough systems 
dukakis last april signed a law banning weekend passes for 
prisoners convicted of murder reversing his administrations 
policy of supporting the program which began in 1972 
that ban was passed by the state legislature after a convicted 
murderer who escaped while on a weekend pass raped a woman in 
maryland last year 
eight months later he was still defending his program bush 
said and only when the massachusetts legislature voted by an 
overwhelming majority to abolish the program for murders did he 
finally give in 
dukakis meanwhile was in texas saturday where he attended the 
funeral of willie velasquez founder of the southwest voter 
registration education project which led drives to register 
hispanics to vote 
velasquez was a nutsandbolts political leader but his 
commitment went deeper than that to the very soul of this country 
to the very heart of our democratic system dukakis said in 
spanish in his eulogy delivered and the funeral mass in san 
antonio his goal was not to change the faces of those we elect 
to public service but to improve the quality of public service 
itself 
after the funeral dukakis was heading for houston to address 
the texas democratic convention where the last of the states 211 
national convention delegates were being picked 
dukakis who won the states primary on march 8 held but a 
narrow lead in delegates over jesse jackson dukakis had 81 
delegates while jackson had 70 and another 60 were uncommitted 
according to the associated press delegate count 
in a speech to the texas democrats dukakis looked ahead to the 
november election saying if anyone tells you that we cant win 
in the south or that we cant win in the west or that we cant 
win in the great state of texas dont you believe it 
you tell them that were going to win 
the vice president was touring drought damage in illinois with 
agriculture secretary richard lyng on saturday 
meanwhile democrat jesse jackson walked into the parched 
cornfield of an illinois republican and prayed for rain on saturday 
i think he ought to have some influence on what happens in the 
next few years farmer dan mau a registered republican said 
after jackson prayed in his field 
jackson later told delegates to the illinois democratic 
convention that there should be a national moratorium on farm 
foreclosures 
no one should lose his land because of this drought jackson 
said 
before leaving washington aboard air force two lyng said that 
reaction to the drought has been exaggerated because this is an 
election year 
a drought in an election year is worse than a drought in a 
nonelection year lyng said people overreact 
nevertheless lyng said the drought is real 
weve tried about all we think we can do in terms of emergency 
steps except money lyng said and its too early to consider 
that

opposition leaders on 
saturday criticized the reinstatement in the army of interior 
minister elias wessin y wessin and his designation as defense 
minister by president joaquin balaguer 
balaguer reinstated gen wessin y wessin a man once accused of 
plotting balaguers ouster on friday after firing defense minister 
lt gen antonio imbert barrera 
wessin y wessin 60 an unsuccessful candidate in the 1968 and 
1982 presidential elections was interior minister in 1971 when 
balaguer sent him into exile accusing him of planning to overthrow 
the government he returned in 1978 and in 1986 backed balaguers 
successful campaign and later was named interior minister 
jose francisco pena gomez head of the opposition dominican 
revolutionary party called wessin y wessins designation 
inconvenient inopportune and a violation of the constitution of 
the republic 
that post should be held by army officers who are first in 
line in the military hierarchy not by an active politician with a 
controversial past in dominican politics especially at the level 
of the armed forces pena gomez said 
the general secretary of the dominican communist party narciso 
isa conde said the appointment of wessin y wessin was done to 
please the united states he said that after being outside of the

position without any kind of leadership in the military 
wessin y wessin is the third defense minister designated by

world leaders went out of their way to stress 
international cooperation saturday on the eve of the sevennation 
economic summit but a contentious fight over agricultural 
subsidies threatened to disrupt the hopedfor tranquility 
the 14th annual meeting between the worlds largest industrial 
countries the united states japan west germany britain 
france italy and canada was being held under the tightest 
security ever seen in canadas largest city 
a 3000member security force was deployed around the 
metropolitan toronto convention center where the government leaders 
will begin meeting sunday protected by 15foothigh chain link 
security fences 
in his weekly radio address broadcast from the oval office 
president reagan looked back to his first economic summit also in 
canada he said there had been changes for the better in the world 
economy in the intervening seven years 
we have led the world toward a remarkable consensus that 
economic freedom not state planning and intervention holds the 
key to growth and development reagan said 
reagan said the toronto summit would be a chance to assure that 
this great venture to progress continues through doing more to 
support economic coordination among the major countries and by 
removing remaining trade barriers 
this years summit is expected to be a lowkey gathering in 
part because president reagan is a lameduck with only seven months 
left in office but also because the economy is doing surprisingly 
well especially in light of the fears of a global recession that 
were widespread immediately following the october stock market 
crash 
growth in most of the major countries has accelerated this year 
driving down unemployment rates to the lowest levels of this decade 
canadian prime minister brian mulroney who is hoping his 
position as the summit host will give him a political boost at 
home said saturday that it would be wrong to dismiss the summit as 
a donothing affair just because no major initiatives are expected 
the coordination and cooperation economically that emanates 
from the summits is a very major contribution towards world 
growth mulroney said during a visit to the rooms where the 
nearly 3000 journalists from 50 countries were setting up shop 
what would we have done last october in the light of the 
market meltdowns without the group of seven mulroney asked 
referring to the seven summit nations the g7 was able to step 
in and send signals of confidence to markets around the world 
reagan who is attending his eighth and final economic summit 
will be the last world leader to arrive on sunday 
the president said saturday that efforts to stop illegal drug 
trafficking and rebuild the economies of afghanistan and the 
philippines also would be on the agenda for the summit as would his 
proposal first made last year at the venice summit to end farm 
subsidies by the end of the century 
but reagans farm proposal has drawn support from few of the 
other leaders with japan west germany and france raising some of 
the strongest objections 
west german chancellor helmut kohl warned in a speech to the 
canadian parliament earlier in the week that leaders must not move 
too quickly on the farm question and jacques delors who 
represents the european economic community at the summit 
complained that the us position on farm subsidies threatened to 
spoil the atmosphere of the talks 
in an interview saturday treasury secretary james a baker iii 
acknowledged that the united states was facing intense opposition 
on the farm question and any breakthrough would be 
extraordinarily difficult but he said the united states hopes 
at least to get commitment that the problem will be a prime topic 
for discussion during the current round of trade liberalization 
talks 
baker said the united states believed it had agreement going 
into the meetings for a final summit communique that would say the 
150 billion major countries spend annually on farm subsidies was 
the foremost trade problem in the world and the countries hoped 
to make progress in solving the problem at a midterm review of the 
trade talks to be held in montreal in december 
we want to move the ball down the field a little bit or at 
least we dont want to be thrown for a loss baker said in an 
interview on the cable news network show evans amp novak 
a british official who spoke on condition that his name not be 
used said that british prime minister margaret thatcher did not 
think the elimination of all subsidies by the year 2000 was 
practical but she did believe the level of subsidies needed to be 
trimmed 
mrs thatcher is definitely pushing for action so as to assure 
farm subsidy disarmament rather than farm subsidy armament the 
official said 
mrs thatcher the leader with the longest tenure among the 
summit leaders arrived at midafternoon saturday followed an hour 
later by italian premier ciriaco de mita who is attending his 
first summit 
mrs thatcher was made an honorary bencher or senior lawyer 
of the law society of upper canada 
de mita was taken immediately from the airport to an 
enthusiastic welcome in the italian section of toronto a city 
which is home to 500000 expatriate italians and likes to boast 
that it is the largest italian community outside of italy 
i have the feeling i never left italy when i look around 
now de mita said in italian to a crowd which needed no 
translation

opponents of the reagan administrations central american polices 
according to documents disclosed by a newspaper saturday

in nicaragua in one probe and groups planning or staging 
demonstrations against us policy in nicaragua in another the 
boston globe reported 
the agency also conducted two investigations into opponents of 
us policies in el salvador the newspaper said the probes were 
captioned salvadoran leftist activities in the united states 
and international terrorism investigation re leftist guerrilla 
activities in el salvador the newspaper reported 
the globe said it obtained the documents under the freedom of 
information act 
the fbi also conducted a separate investigation into members of 
tecnica a group that sends engineers to nicaragua to work on small 
scale development projects the newspaper reported 
benjamin linder a 27yearold american engineer who was killed 
last year by contra forces was working with a group affiliated 
with tecnica 
a house subcommittee last year looked into the possibility that 
the fbis interviews of tecnica volunteers returning from nicaragua 
amounted to an unwarranted investigation of the group 
in addition to the investigations reported by the globe two 
congressional committees and fbi director william sessions are 
investigating the bureaus conduct in its probe of the committee in 
solidarity with the people of el salvador 
the globe asked the center for constitutional rights a public 
interest lawyers group based in new york city to analyze the 
documents 
david lerner a group lawyer said the documents indicated that 
the fbis activity was even more widespread than previously 
believed 
the fbis surveillance of opponents of all the reagans 
central america policies is pervasive anyone active in opposing 
us policy in all of central america seems to have been a 
target the newspaper quoted lerner as saying 
but fbi spokeswoman sue schnitzer denied that the bureaus 
investigations are politically motivated 
we dont go after people because of politics we go after 
people we suspect of committing a violation of us law the 
paper quoted schnitzer as saying 
ann mari buitrago of the center for constitutional rights was 
quoted as saying it is impossible to determine the number or extent 
of the various fbi investigations because most of the documents 
have been blacked out 
one of the two nicaraguan documents is captioned nicaraguan 
terrorist matters international terrorism nicaragua the 
newspaper reported it contains a report on a 1986 demonstration in 
chicago by pledge of resistance a group that began protesting the 
administrations procontra policies around 1985 
in 1985 after being questioned by congress former fbi director 
william webster admitted that fbi agents interviewed more than 100 
us citizens who had visited nicaragua as well as their friends 
landlords and employees in some cases 
webster said then that some of those interviews may have been 
requested by the cia or the national security council 
the fbi has maintained that its interviews were prompted by 
counterintelligence concerns such as fears that travelers may have 
been asked by nicaraguan officials to obtain information or spy on 
the united states

british prime minister margaret thatcher said 
saturday shell do some vigorous batting at the sevennation 
economic summit and aides said it will include pushing for farm 
subsidy disarmament and debt relief for the poorest african 
countries 
at a ceremony in the paneled library of torontos osgoode hall 
within hours of her arrival mrs thatcher was made an honorary 
bencher or senior lawyer of the law society of upper canada 
addressing the blackgowned members of the society the 
professions governing body in the province of ontario mrs 
thatcher noted that the summit opening sunday coincided with an 
cricket match between canadian graduates of britains ancient 
oxford and cambridge universities 
it wont be the only match in town said mrs thatcher i 
intend to do some fairly vigorous batting myself on a different 
pitch 
earlier the british spokesman who insisted on anonymity said 
mrs thatcher hoped the threeday summit would provide impetus for 
farm subsidy reform at the december midterm review in montreal of 
the general agreement on tariffs and trade which regulates 
international trade 
britain is seeking farm subsidy disarmament rather than farm 
subsidy armament said the thatcher spokesman 
i dont think we would regard the elimination of all subsidies 
by the year 2000 as a practical solution but we ought to be moving 
in that direction said the spokesman 
the united states wants all farm subsidies eliminated by that 
date but west european countries and japan envisage only reducing 
the subsidies 
the spokesman said mrs thatcher as well as chancellor of the 
exchequer nigel lawson would also be pushing for joint action on 
relieving the debt burden of the poorest african countries 
there should be a fairly specific agreement on african debt in 
particular were looking for a firm commitment for action he 
said 
earlier some ontario lawyers protested granting mrs thatcher 
the bencher award citing her refusal to impose tough sanctions 
on south africa 
clayton ruby one of the benchers who protested said 
this is a leader whose principal accomplishment has been to 
frustrate canadas attempts to end apartheid 
laura legge acting head of the 191yearold society said only 
three of the 44 benchers had protested adding margaret 
thatcher regardless of ones politics is a woman who has been 
highly successful 
in a her acceptance speech mrs thatcher said the right to live 
under the rule of law will be the test of the soviet unions policy 
of glasnost or openness 
that will be the key test of whether the changes we are seeing 
in the communist societies are a true step toward democracy she 
said 
mrs thatcher is the 13th honorary bencher in the societys 
history they include elizabeth mother of britains queen 
elizabeth ii and former canadian governor general roland michener 
britain is a major south african trading partner mrs thatcher 
has refused to impose embargoes saying they would hurt the black 
majority most encourage white resistance to change and cost jobs 
in britain and south africa 
canada which had scant economic ties with south africa has 
been a leading proponent of tough measures by the commonwealth the 
48nation association of britain and its former colonies 
earlier canadian officials and fur trappers lauded a british 
decision not to insist fur coats carry warnings that the animals 
may have been cruelly trapped 
the government proposal drawn up under pressure from 
animalrights activists would have made retailers and 
manufacturers put the labels in wild fox and lynx coats but not in 
minks 
it is an especially canadian victory kids teachers 
parliamentarians got behind the trappers and native people and 
brought political pressure to the highest level in britain said 
canadian fur institute spokesman kirk smith in an interview with 
torontos globe and mail 
the fur industry employs 100000 canadians about half of them 
native indians and inuit and is worth more than 400 million a 
year 
mrs thatcher appeared likely to discuss with canadian prime 
minister brian mulroney a lucrative 10 billion contract to sell 
canada 1012 nuclearpowered submarines which france is also 
trying to win mulroney is also hosting french president francois 
mitterrand at the summit 
britain is seeking to sell the canadians its trafalgarclass 
submarine built with us technology 
under an angloamerican agreement britain must get us 
permission to pass on the technology to a third country president 
reagan said last month he would not object but congress still must 
give its approval 
france would sell canada its smaller and cheaper rubis 
amethyste submarine built entirely with french technology

two advocates of reform in interviews 
published saturday said hungarys new communist leaders can bring 
about change because they are younger and not responsible for years 
of stagnation 
the new communist party politburo has a striking generation 
difference from the one headed by janos kadar replaced as party 
leader after 32 years in power said imre pozsgay 
pozsgay was appointed to the politburo at last months national 
party conference 
he has called for dialogues with independent political groups 
and in the intervew said more pluralism should accompany economic 
reforms 
that pluralism exists in socialism communist society is 
an indisputable fact of life he said in an interview with the 
communist party daily nepszabadsag 
reszo nyers also elected to the politburo last month said in 
an interview with the government newspaper magyar hirlap that it 
was of serious political importance that people enter or 
reenter the leadership who carry no direct responsibility for the 
economic policy and general policy of the past 1015 years 
nyers the planner of hungarys economic reforms in the late 
1960s was ousted from the politburo in 1973 after apparently 
pushing too hard for more changes 
eight elderly politburo members including kadar 76 were swept 
from power at the party conference reducing the average age of the 
11member ruling body to 52 
the interviews were published two days after police broke up a 
demonstration in budapest by hungarians calling for the 
rehabilitation of imre nagy the leader during the 1956 revolt 
nagy and many of his associates were executed in 1958 soviet 
troops put down the uprising 
pozsgay and nyers did not mention the revolt in the interviews 
but pozsgay said hungarian history had to be reviewed factually all 
the way back to 1945 the premier and new communist party leader 
karoly grosz said last week he would appoint pozsgay to head a 
special committee to review hungarys history of the past 15 to 20 
years and take a longterm look at the coming 20 years 
in a related development magyar hirlap reported saturday that 
authorities had assured organizers of the thursday demonstration 
that there would be no interference as long as the protesters were 
not antiregime 
the article was the first detailed official account of events 
dealing with the nagy demonstration 
magyar hirlap said authorities had contacted organizers in 
advance and told them no steps would be taken to disturb their 
expression of their respect toward the dead 
the newspaper said a memorial event at a budapest cemetery where 
nagy is believed to be buried was held without any disturbance of 
public order by some 400 people 
but it said 15 people were detained during the afternoon 
demonstration in downtown budapest and were released by 10 pm 
witnesses had reported however that some 400 peopled moved on 
to the hungarian television building where they were dispersed by 
riot police with truncheons

reassuring high school graduation present a 38caliber pistol 
i was shocked at first i hadnt expected it ms kragh said 
friday of the gift from her parents 
she likes the idea of having a handgun in her sports car while 
she drives 250 miles alone on the freeways between fresno and the 
university of california at irvine where she plans to study 
biological sciences

security blanket she added 
her mother geri kragh said she first thought of buying a 
handgun for her oldest daughter after seeing a television talk show 
program on daterape murders and violence on college campuses the 
stories were similar to what mrs kragh who attends fresno state 
university reads in the campus newspaper 
i just want her to have the option to have the protection if 
she wants it mrs kragh said 
her daughter plans to attend selfdefense classes in college 
but at 5feet2inches tall and weighing about 90 pounds shes 
doubtful she could wrestle off a large attacker 
i originally kind of approached it as a joke and in fact 
didnt tell my husband until the night we bought it mrs kragh 
recalled larry kragh a former reserve sheriffs deputy mulled 
over the idea as the couple sat in the car outside a sports store 
the more he thought about it the more he thought it would be 
a good idea mrs kragh said 
i didnt think my dad would go for it ms kragh said as she 
prepared for a postgraduation vacation cruise in the carribean 
she graduated from hoover high school on tuesday 
she has completed a gun safety class where she said she was by 
far the youngest person at the firing range 
the gun is registered and she plans to carry it unloaded and in 
a container to avoid the need for the license required for carrying 
concealed weapons mrs kragh said 
obtaining such a license is extremely difficult and applicants 
have to state a reason said fresno police lt lynn button it 
has to be a good and sound reason for personal safety button

michael dukakis expressing growing confidence 
about his chances to win the presidency told texas democrats 
saturday to ignore predictions he cant carry the south vamos a 
ganar he told them were going to win 
dukakis brought texas democratic convention delegates to their 
feet saturday cheering first in spanish then in english were 
going to win 
in a speech to the convention dukakis said if anyone tells 
that we cant win in the south or that we cant win in the west 
or that we cant win in the great state of texas dont you believe 
it 
you tell them that were going to win 
texas is the adopted home state of republican george bush but 
dukakis refuses to concede the state to the vice president 
one order of business at the state convention was to complete 
allocation of delegates to the democratic national convention 
dukakis edged jesse jackson in the texas primary on march 8 but 
in a separate system of caucuses in texas jackson gained ground 
according to the associated press delegate count dukakis could 
expect support from 76 texas delegates while 71 would back 
jackson another 64 were uncommitted including delegates 
previously pledged to tennessee sen albert gore jr 
however those figures could shift as the delegate selection 
moves through its final stages 
gore planned to ask his delegates to switch to dukakis on monday 
one of dukakis strengths in texas is his support in the 
hispanic community stemming in part from his fluent spanish 
before he flew to the democratic convention he was in san 
antonio where he delivered a eulogy at the funeral of william 
velasquez founder of the southwest voter registration and 
education project an organization credited with getting hundreds 
of thousands of hispanics registered to vote 
velasquez who died of cancer on wednesday had planned to 
introduce dukakis to the state convention 
he was our friend dukakis told mourners who packed st 
marys roman catholic church we learned from him we were 
inspired by him we will never forget him 
shifting to spanish dukakis said willie was a nutsandbolts 
political leader but his commitment went deeper than that to the 
very soul of this country to the very heart of our democratic 
system his goal was not to change the faces of those we elect 
to public service but to improve the quality of public service 
itself 
in his speech to the houston convention dukakis recalled the 
1960 presidential election when massachusetts sen john f kennedy 
picked texan lyndon b johnson as his running mate 
today as in 1960 were in a battle for the economic future 
of america and now as then the old ways simply will not do 
he ridiculed bushs criticism of his harvard ties saying 
some people say this election is about where we went to college 
i say its about whether our children will have the chance to go to 
college 
dukakis said the democrats were the party of working americans 
of families of progress of strength and of the future 
were going to win because were americas party he said 
from texas dukakis flew to montgomery ala for a meeting with 
former gov george c wallace 
after a brief session at wallaces suburban montgomery home the 
two men spoke with reporters in front of the house 
i appreciate him coming to alabama said the former 
governor who is hard of hearing and uses a wheelchair 
dukakis shook hands with wallace and promised ill be back 
ill be back 
the massachusetts governor then attended a rally at a hotel in

wednesday to rescind an order by namphy transferring and retiring 
several highranking officers 
among those namphy attempted to transfer was col jeanclaude 
paul who was indicted for drug trafficking earlier this year by a 
grand jury in miami 
manigat apparently siding with paul said the order was 
unconstitutional because it was done without consulting him 
the dismissal of namphy seems to have enforced manigats 
authority said sylvio claude leader of the opposition christian 
democratic party but politically we must wait and see whether 
manigat can control the army he has apparently betrayed 
paul commands the 700man dessalines barracks whose soldiers 
were blamed for widespread violence against voters that left more 
than 30 people dead and forced cancellation of independently 
administered general elections nov 29 
manigat was declared the winner of jan 17 elections organized 
by the junta manigat was considered the armys candidate in the 
election 
it is too soon to say whether there has been a reinforcement 
of civilian authority over the military because in any case manigat 
must still make concessions to certain sectors of the army said 
victor benoit coleader of the leftist congress of democratic 
forces 
it was unclear why namphy ordered the transfer and whether the 
order represented a power struggle within the army or was linked to 
the us charges against paul who has denied any wrongdoing 
the reagan administration asked namphy to get rid of paul but 
manigat it seems has gotten rid of namphy claude said 
foreign affairs minister gerard latortue called the removal a 
strictly internal matter

the government is reevaluating two decades 
worth of intelligence obtained from cuba after discovering that 
many sources were double agents working for the communist 
government there a congressman said saturday 
a large number of our intelligence activities in cuba 
involved individuals who apparently were double agents over the 
past 20 years us rep dan mica chairman of the house 
international operations subcommittee told the associated press in 
an interview 
there is great concern 
mica said the government also is investigating romantic 
encounters between marine guards at the us interests section in 
havana and cuban women but he added that guards probably didnt 
betray us secrets 
the congressman also disclosed that an investigation of us 
embassies in other east bloc countries indicated there may have 
been as many as 500 attempts to use women to entice marine guards 
into compromising security 
mica said a cuban defector raised the claims that us 
intelligence in cuba had been undermined he declined to identify 
the defector or give other details 
as we were starting to check it the scope just became 
astounding mica said there is now in process a major review 
of what did we get the last 20 years who did we get it from what 
did we do with it did it have an effect on foreign policy did we 
advise our military and our allies improperly 
mica said the central intelligence agency the naval 
investigative service state department intelligence and the 
general accounting office have been investigating cuban 
intelligence for several months 
were still trying to assess the damage mica said 
congressional investigators havent publicized the probes but 
mica said he agreed to discuss them following disclosures last week 
that four marine guards at the interests section in havana 
fraternized with cuban women 
mica was in tampa for a political forum sponsored by the florida 
education associationunited where he appeared with three other 
democrats who are seeking the partys nomination to run for the 
us senate 
mica who went to moscow to look into soviet bugging of the us 
embassy and the sexforsecrets scandal involving us marine 
guards there last year said he pushed then for a probe of embassy 
security in other unfriendly nations 
we discovered what appeared to be a pattern and practice of 
soviet bloc countries targeting marine guards some 500 cases 
around the world came to our attention that never had had the 
appropriate followup mica said 
the state department and the marines have played down the report 
of 500 cases of possible wrongdoing since the moscow investigation 
led to only two convictions one on minor counts the marines said 
many of the reported infractions were minor such as curfew 
violations and telephone misuse 
the fiveterm congressman said he hopes to visit the american 
diplomatic mission in havana in the next week or two the united 
states does not have full diplomatic relations with cuba but the 
two countries exchanged interest sections that carry out diplomatic 
and immigration functions 
mica said there are 23 american staff members at the mission and 
about 90 cuban nationals employed for clerical and other support 
services 
the way its structured its very difficult to do the 
appropriate work in any kind of minimal intelligencegathering 
without secure areas being entered by cuban nationals said mica 
the state department plans to set up an annex in south miami to 
handle visas and other clerical functions and allow a reduction in 
the number of foreign nationals in the havana mission and us 
embassies in other latin american nations mica said

president daniel ortega on saturday 
defended economic reforms enacted by his government last week and 
said the measures were necessary to strengthen the leftist 
revolution 
facing a sometimes hostile audience of 1000 people in an open 
meeting ortega insisted his reforms were based in an economy of 
a socialist nature 
the government on wednesday devalued the cordoba nicaraguas 
currency nearly doubled gasoline prices and enacted a general pay 
raise of 30 percent 
ortega last week said the government would lift wage and price 
controls in hopes of stimulating productivity 
two unions controlled by the opposition socialist party on 
friday demanded 600 percent wage hikes to keep up with inflation 
and the primary school teachers guild said it also will pursue a 
salary increase 
explaining the measures to the crowd ortega said the greatest 
problem is provoked by yankee aggression 
the united states has maintained a threeyearold economic 
embargo against nicaragua and supported a more than sixyear rebel 
insurgency against the leftist sandinista regime the reagan 
administration recently has been discussing new military aid to the 
rebels known as contras 
the nicaraguan government estimates the civil war has caused 3 
billion in damage to the economy 
several people attending the meeting one in a series the 
government terms face the people complained the 30 percent 
general pay raise failed to make up for rising food costs prompted 
by the reforms 
the problem here is hunger and nothing else a health worker 
told the president 
ortega called on his audience to mount a great 
politicalideological effort to ensure the success of the 
measures 
we are convinced that we are going to surmount this historical 
moment and will have better conditions to attend to all of the 
demands of nicaraguan workers ortega said

foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher said saturday that nato and the warsaw pact should both 
strive toward eliminating their capacities to launch surprise 
attacks on each other 
speaking in an interview on the west german radio station 
deutsche welle genscher said the warsaw pact must be prepared to 
undertake asymmetrical disarmament steps because of its 
advantage over nato in tanks and other conventional forces 
conventional imbalances make up the central problem for 
european security genscher said 
but he suggested nato itself should also be prepared to make 
sacrifices 
it is crucial that we now concentrate on creating conventional 
forces stability and on eliminating both sides capabilities 
for surprise attacks genscher said 
genschers remarks came a week after he praised a new soviet 
proposal for a threestage plan to reduce natos and the warsaw 
pacts conventional forces some us officials see the proposal as 
soviet propaganda move

the japanese government announced saturday on 
the eve of the sevennation economic summit here that it is 
absolving 17 of the poorest third world countries of 1 billion in 
debt over the next five years 
the initiative followed an announcement june 14 that japan was 
more than doubling its overseas development aid to at least 50 
billion in the next five years 
michihiko kunihiro chief cabinet councillor on external 
affairs told a briefing that japan has extended 55 billion in 
development loans over the past decade to the 17 countries 
involved which are mostly in africa but also include burma and 
bangladesh 
he said because of legal constraints japan is not writing off 
the loans 
but over the next five years the 1 billion due in capital and 
interest repayments will be waived the sum is part of the 50 
billion package 
kunihiro said the decision does not preclude giving additional 
aid to the poor nations 
japan has been criticized for apportioning less of its gross 
national product in foreign aid than other major industrialized 
countries 
but kunihiro said japan had increased its assistance to 75 
billion last year compared with 86 billion in aid provided by 
the united states and added if we increase our aid at this 
rate for the next one or two years it may soon be higher than the 
united states 
kunihiro did not provide a list of the 17 countries

substances had been arriving regularly at klong toey port from 
singapore since 1978 the newspaper said 
all cargo unloaded at the dock is supposed to be picked up

auction it off thai law restricts the opening of arriving cargo by 
port officials

chatham 
mau a registered republican said he had not decided whom he 
would support for president but added that jackson a democrat 
made a good impression 
i think he ought to have some influence on what happens in the 
next few years he said

although massachusetts gov michael dukakis has garnered more 
than enough delegates to be the partys nominee jackson urged

and there is somebody from illinois running with ideas said 
jackson who has a home in chicago and founded the chicagobased

former navy secretary john f lehman jr may 
have tipped off a friend that he was a target in the federal 
investigation of alleged widespread fraud and corruption in defense 
department procurement according to published reports 
the los angeles times and the washington post reported in their 
sunday editions that federal investigations are pursuing 
information that lehman may have warned melvyn r paisley former 
assistant navy secretary who later became a successful defense 
consultant that his telephones were being tapped in a massive 
probe of defense contracting fraud 
the post quoted law enforcement sources as saying that questions 
about lehman focus on whether he may have obstructed justice by 
warning paisley that his activities might be the subject of a 
federal investigation 
the times however quoted sources as saying the information is 
nothing close to strong enough at this point for considering 
charges against lehman 
the times cited an unidentified source as saying the alleged 
warning signs of which came to agents through a wiretap took 
place before lehman left office in april 1987 but the post quoted 
one source as saying the alleged warning occurred after both men 
had left government service 
henry e hudson us attorney in alexandria va who is 
coordinating the investigation responded with a terse no 
comment when asked by sen charles e grassley riowa whether 
lehman was a target of the fastdeveloping federal inquiry by the 
fbi believed to be the largest in the nations defense contracting 
history 
the times said lehman at his mclean va home refused 
saturday to answer questions about the probe saying it would be 
inappropriate of me to comment on an ongoing investigation he 
said he would break his silence after the investigation is 
completed 
lehman and paisley have been close associates for years as an 
official of the boeing co paisley hired lehman as a consultant 
nearly a decade ago lehman then recruited paisley to become 
assistant navy secretary in 1981 and he served as navy research 
chief until 1987 
law enforcement sources have identified paisley as a central 
figure in the probe of pentagon contracting his home and office 
were searched tuesday sources familiar with the investigation have 
said authorities bugged his consulting office and tapped his 
telephone 
the nationwide federal investigation which involves private 
defense consultants pentagon officials and defense contractors 
was made public last tuesday as agents searched 38 offices and 
homes in an effort to find evidence of bribes and gratuities paid 
for disclosure of confidential contracting information the 
information allegedly gave recipients a competitive edge in 
submitting bids for contracts

the us navy rescue swimmer school at 
pensacola fla which was closed after a recruit drowned in march 
will reopen monday with new instructors and safety guidelines a 
congressional aide said saturday 
john fink an aide to rep toby roth rwis said the navy 
would announce the reopening monday 
navy officials in pensacola did not return telephone calls 
saturday 
the navy closed the school march 29 after an investigation into 
the march 2 drowning of lee mirecki of appleton showed mirecki 
had been held underwater in the schools training pool 
a medical examiner testified at a hearing earlier this month 
that mirecki 19 died from heart failure caused by the sheer 
terror of being held underwater against his will 
five instructors face possible courtmartial on charges of 
involuntary manslaughter in mireckis death and the officer in 
charge of the school faces courtmartial for dereliction of duty 
fink said one of the schools new guidelines will prohibit 
instructors from physically handling students in the water 
instead students will practice rescue techniques and combat skills 
on each other while instructors supervise he said 
fink said the reopening announcement originally was scheduled 
for friday but was delayed because of a question about the wording 
of one new guideline 
the announcement planned for friday stated that unauthorized 
exercises such as sharks and daisies will be prohibited fink 
said he said he asked lt cmdr michael mcguire a congressional 
liaison officer about the phrasing because it was the navys first 
known reference to an exercise being unauthorized 
after consulting his superiors mcguire said the announcement 
would be withheld until monday fink said 
according to testimony at the hearing mirecki died during a 
sharks and daisies exercise in which students swim face down 
while instructors roam the side of the pool periodically jumping 
on students to simulate attacks by potential drowning victims 
rescue students are expected to free themselves from the attacker 
the new guidelines also will address how to handle requests to 
drop a class fink said 
testimony at the hearing revealed that mirecki screamed the 
letters dor which stand for drop on request but instructors 
forced him back into the pool to continue the exercise 
under the schools rules he should have been permitted to drop 
the class officials said 
meanwhile the appletonpost crescent reported saturday that two 
sources who requested anonymity said a recommendation on whether 
to courtmartial the six men charged in mireckis death has been 
delivered to rear adm david morris he has 120 days to dismiss the 
charges discipline the six or order military trials 
the newspaper said a decision is expected in july

the federal aviation administration has refused 
to consider reducing the number of flights at ohare international 
airport despite repeated requests by federal safety officials who 
fear traffic overloads a newspaper reported saturday 
the clash of positions was underscored in a may 31 letter from 
the chairman of the national transportation safety board to the 
head of the faa the chicago tribune reported 
the newspaper said ntsb chairman jim burnett told faa chief t 
allan mcartor in the letter that the board considered the faas 
position on ohares traffic volume unacceptable 
the letter preceded the safety boards announcement june 8 of an 
investigation into a sharp rise in controller error at ohare air 
traffic controllers have made 20 mistakes so far this year 
allowing planes to fly too close to each other compared with just 
12 in all of 1987 
investigators who concluded their onsite work last week are 
looking to see if work overload played any role in the recent 
incidents 
i think things are in the embryonic stage as to what the 
evaluation is said michael benson a board spokesman in 
washington there is no way to tell where it is going i havent 
heard of any single cause that has jumped out and said fix 
me 
the ntsb can only make suggestions it has no enforcement power 
in the past the ntsb has urged faa officials to reexamine the 
limit of 155 flights per hour at ohare to see if it is too high 
but the agency has declined to do so the tribune reported 
burnett questioned the limit last march during a congressional 
hearing in chicago on problems at ohare he said it may be 
overloading air traffic controllers 
there is a tendency to take shortcuts to not follow standard 
procedures that slow down operations burnett said they are 
pushing too hard to do what is being asked of them 
meanwhile the new york times reported in sunday editions that 
the lagging capacity of the nations airports could paralyze air 
traffic within five years without a national commitment to a 
building project on the scale of the program that built the 
interstate highway system

a newborn pygmy sperm whale that beached 
itself near patrick air force base died friday at sea world marine 
park in orlando park officials said 
the 2foot calf orphaned when its mother died in the surf had 
been cared for by animal handlers at sea world since late tuesday 
but they had not expected him to survive since most whales only 
seek land when they are in extreme difficulty 
the animal apparently died from a combination of factors said 
sea world research biologist dan odell the results of a necropsy 
to determine the cause of death are not expected for several weeks 
he said 
the cause of death of the 10foot mother whale also has not been 
determined

two men from northern ireland were convicted 
friday of plotting an irish republican army bombing campaign in 
england 
patrick mclaughlin and liam mccotter are to be sentenced monday 
and could receive terms of up to life in prison 
they were arrested by agents of the antiterrorist squad in 
february 1987 after nearly 200 pounds of explosives along with 
detonators timing devices three rifles and ammunition were found 
the explosives and weapons were hidden in plastic garbage cans 
in the macclesfield and delamere forests south of manchester in 
northern england 
prosecuting attorneys said police also found maps of manchester 
and london in the manchester apartment the two men shared 
the court was told that mclaughlin 40 and mccotter 25 both 
from belfast were kept under surveillance for four days as they 
transferred the weapons from a trawler off the welsh coast into the 
forests 
full details of the operation were not revealed at the trial 
prosecutor roy amlot told the jury that the antiterrorist squad 
had the wider public interest to consider and could not release 
information that might jeopardize future operations 
intelligence for the antiterrorist squad and police in this 
country generally is critical it might prevent another bombing 
campaign he said 
amlot said the contents of the arms caches was sufficient for a 
sustained and prolonged terror campaign with at least 25 bombs 
the mainly roman catholic ira is battling to unite northern 
ireland a british province where protestants outnumber catholics 
32 with the predominantly catholic republic of ireland the ira

here are some comments friday from the

michael dukakis responding to attacks by sen john mccain 
rariz levelled from tennessee and florida that dukakis is a 
teddy kennedy liberal who is soft on crime they send some 
guy from arizona to florida who doesnt know beans from brown 
bread 
 
sen sam nunn of georgia asked if he would accept a spot on the 
presidential ticket with dukakis if invited i think its very 
presumptuous to sort of set up a hypothetical example of what one 
would do if one were offered something that one is not seeking and 
one is discouraging 
 
george bush on allegations of widespread bribery and corruption 
at the pentagon corruption anywhere in government is bad enough 
but these people should the allegations prove true were not just 
stealing money from the treasury they were stealing from our

a band of british hippies heading for an annual 
festival of modernday druids invaded the ancient stonehenge 
monument and scuffled with police who tried to keep them away 
nine vehicles drove through a perimeter fence friday night and 
then with police in pursuit the occupants jumped out and ran 
across the open land around the giant stones 
police said they made about 30 arrests for alleged criminal 
damage and public order offenses 
a number of them did resist arrest and they put up a very 
fierce struggle which had to be curtailed said assistant chief 
constable james hogarth 
the hippies annual convoy heading for a traditional ceremony 
by whiterobed modernday druids on the first day of summer next 
tuesday had been monitored by police as it drove through wiltshire 
county 
police said they warned the convoy not to stop at stonehenge but 
some vehicles suddenly turned off the road and smashed a hole in 
the fence 
stonehenge 85 miles west of london is a stateprotected 
monument of the governmentfunded english heritage the 
organization bars hippies from the annual summer ceremony because 
they allegedly damaged the turf and the stones in past years 
on the first day of summer the sun rises over one of the stones 
creating an avenue of shadow within the monument underpinning a 
belief that the prehistoric stone circle dating from about 1800 
bc was built for a religious or ceremonial purpose

a congressional study agency is criticizing 
the environmental protection agency for trying to save money by not 
choosing permanent cleanup methods often enough at the worst toxic 
waste sites 
technical evidence confirms that all too frequently superfund 
is not working environmentally the way the law directs it to 
said the report by the office of technology assessment 
the report was prepared to coincide with a hearing monday by the 
investigations subcommittee of the house energy and commerce 
committee it was released in advance and an embargo requested by 
ota was broken friday 
the report examined epas compliance with 1986 amendments that 
require the agency to prefer permanent remedies designed to reduce 
the toxicity mobility or volume of the waste and to analyze 
the risk of failure if waste is to be put or left in the ground 
untreated 
treatment methods might be incineration of soil or turning the 
contaminated soil into a glassy solid 
the amendments were adopted because of congressional concern 
that epa trying to stretch its funds too often was applying 
bandaid solutions or was moving waste from a superfund site to 
a hazardous waste landfill that was likely to become such a site 
impermanent remedies which provide less protection than 
permanent ones and do not assuredly meet cleanup goals are often 
selected purely because they are cheaper in the short run in the 
long run they are very likely to be more expensive the report 
said 
permanence may be claimed even when technical factors suggest 
a high probability of failure it said 
the authors examined 104 cleanup decisions that fell under the 
1986 requirements and selected 10 they said were representative 
winston porter assistant epa administrator in charge of the 
superfund program which provides money to clean up sites requiring 
quick attention said the study was a very superficial look at 
the program 
i wouldnt mind if they didnt try to draw such sweeping 
conclusions porter said i disagree with the 
extrapolations they make 
porter said treatment technologies were possible in 87 of the 
104 cases and were selected in 67 instances were not getting 
enough credit 
the law also requires epa to chose costeffective remedies 
and to consider preferences of states and communities involved 
they continually pressure us to be consistent but i keep 
telling them the communities arent consistent the states arent 
consistent and the problems arent consistent porter said 
states pay 10 percent of federal cleanup costs and states 
tell us im not going to pay 10 percent of 80 million porter 
said whether people like or dont like a technology like 
incineration varies from place to place

priests who fall in love and marry say they 
should not have to give up their priestly duties especially since 
there is such a critical shortage of clergy in the roman catholic 
church 
they havent been able to accept us what id like to see 
them do is to begin to open the doors said carl hemmer a former 
jesuit from fairfax va 
frank bonnike a founder of the corps of reserve priests united 
for service said married priests feel that women and marriage 
and family and children have enhanced our ability to minister 
we have two calls the call to priestly work and the call to 
marriage we can be faithful to both he said friday as the group 
opened its first national conference 
about 10 percent of us parishes have no fulltime priest 
according to the group which said the figure is more than 40 
percent worldwide fewer young men are entering seminaries and 
celibacy is cited in surveys as an important reason 
terrance a sweeney whose 1986 survey of us bishops showed 
that nearly a quarter favored optional celibacy for priests called 
the churchs policy against marriage for priests contrary to god 
and human nature 
its a scandal that the church proclaims the dignity of the 
human person and human rights to the world but within her own 
walls and her canon laws forbids this fundamental human 
right he said 
since the 12th century the catholic church has demanded priests 
take a vow of celibacy maintaining that unmarried clergymen are 
better able to devote themselves to god and the priesthood 
priests who marry are forbidden to say mass or have a parish but 
are allowed to perform some sacraments in an emergency the church 
terms them former priests although once a priest is ordained 
he is considered a priest for life 
the priests group says there are between 15000 and 17000 
married priests in the united states the national conference of 
catholic bishops said it had no official figures and declined 
further comment friday 
women who marry priests have their own difficulties said pamela 
sweeney who has been married to terrance sweeney for seven months 
i really went through a very soulsearching period i didnt 
know whether i should feel ashamed and guilty and dirty to fall in 
love with this man she said i have been called every name in 
the book seductress and temptress and the devil its very 
painful 
she feels women are not to blame for taking men away from the 
priesthood but rather its that the church is preventing them 
from functioning 
priests do fall in love and no law that imposes celibacy can 
say that those emotions are not going to take place she said

who had sought 430000 
the suit filed against dr robert coleman a plastic surgeon who 
performed the twostage operation 
it claimed the manufactured vagina inserted during the operation 
was too small for intercourse the suit said the surgeon failed to 
warn his patient of that possibility resulting in depression and 
four suicide attempts 
in closing statements thursday james h ensz the defense 
lawyer said the suit was filed against coleman to get money 
a person wanted to punish a doctor and by obvious inference 
wanted to make a lot of money ensz said but money is not 
going to make this person feel any better about herself what dr 
coleman has done is performed a good surgery unfortunately the 
plaintiff cant accept it wont accept it

as leaders of the worlds largest industrialized 
democracies began assembling today for their annual economic summit 
meeting us overtures to japan for a free trade agreement hinted 
at a potential final triumph for president reagan 
already on the summit agenda was a us joust with the europeans 
over agriculture subsidies the us delegation probably joined by 
canada will seek an end to all agricultural subsidies but the 
idea is meeting stiff resistance from france and west germany 
embarking on negotiations with japan for a free trade agreement 
would overshadow any move on subsidies more than onethird 598 
billion of americas 1987 trade deficit of 1703 billion 
represented the edge japan has in trade with the united states 
critics contend this could be sharply reduced if the two 
partners opened their markets to each other without protectionist 
devices reagan has made the seven economic summits he has attended 
since 1981 a test of his free enterprise policy and he has 
invariably triumphed 
while there is no current discussion over such a treaty us 
treasury secretary james a baker iii said friday in washington 
that a free trade agreement would be something that the united 
states would be pleased to consider if it were something that the 
government of japan wanted to consider 
as baker made the comments in a television interview with 
foreign journalists secretary of state george p shultz made 
tentative plans to meet here next week with japanese foreign 
minister sosuke uno 
the trade imbalance was bound to be on the agenda for shultz an 
ardent freetrader who has kept a careful eye on the robust yen 
the west german chancellor helmut kohl the first to arrive 
pledged in a speech friday at toronto university that we will use 
all means at our disposal to promote stable noninflationary world 
economic growth we will resolutely combat protectionism of any 
kind 
as he received an honorary degree kohl said the industrialized 
countries would have to find ways to avoid overproducing food 
the summit host canadian prime minister brian mulroney visited 
the convention center where the summit will open on sunday to tell 
reporters he hoped it would be a worldclass event 
he said reagan who will be making his final summit appearance 
had been a good friend and valued ally and that future summits 
would be much poorer without him 
with countries around the world spending 150 to 200 billion on 
farm subsidies mulroney said it is very important that all of 
us including japan recognize that these subsidies to agriculture 
are tradedistorting in nature and eventually protectionist 
the canadian added they cost treasuries more money than any 
of us can legitimately afford and ultimately theyre very harmful 
to the farmers 
japanese prime minister noboru takeshita arrived late friday 
after a oneday stopover in vancouver british columbia while 
prime ministers margaret thatcher of britain and ciriaco de mita of 
italy were scheduled to fly in today 
reagan and french president francois mitterrand are due on 
sunday just before the opening bell

six senators are touring the sunscorched 
wheat lands of montana and the dakotas this weekend to help them 
come up with recommendations for federal assistance to 
droughtstricken growers 
im hopeful that the trip will give us a better handle on how 
severe the devastation is in these specific locations senate 
agriculture committee chairman patrick j leahy dvt said friday 
he told a housesenate task force convened to assess the problem 
that he wanted to see firsthand how the drought has affected 
wheat and forage land 
task force members said there was no time to lose in producing a 
blueprint for combating droughtrelated financial and foodsupply 
problems 
agriculture secretary richard e lyng also on hand has been 
saying it is too early to start pushing a droughtaid bill but that 
lawmakers should be prepared to act once the full extent of the 
damage is clear 
lawmakers plan to unveil a few initial recommendations next 
wednesday 
it remains unclear just how much damage the drought will cause 
usda authorities still say an inch or so of rain once a week for 
the rest of the growing season could bring back midwest corn and 
soybeans 
peril to wheat in montana and the dakotas is greater and cattle 
growers in several states are searching for feed to replace hay 
that has withered under the blazing sun 
lawmakers from the afflicted wheat states already are calling 
the drought the worst since the dust bowl era and warning that much 
of their crop will now be lost even if the skies open up 
farmers complain that the drought could crimp their income 
potential in two ways 
forecasts of a smaller harvest have driven up crop prices which 
in turn has decreased the size of incomesupport payments some 
farmers receive 
that is because the amount of the farmers payment is the 
difference between the market price of the crop and higher target 
prices that are set by congress and adjusted annually by the 
secretary of agriculture 
as the market price creeps closer and closer to the target 
price the amount of the payment automatically shrinks at the same 
time the crop itself is wilting under the blazing sun making it 
impossible for the farmer to take advantage of the higher market 
price 
the scenario grows darker for the farmer who has received a 
portion of the incomesupport payment in advance used the money to 
patch a barn roof or buy new machinery and now may be required to 
return part to the government 
sen richard g lugar rind told the task force it would 
come ultimately to a problem of income security for farmers and a 
question of how deficiency income support payments will be made 
the drought task force will work to give farmers a degree of 
income safety even in the midst of a drought that extends for 
several weeks he said lugar said about twothirds of indianas 
corn and soybeans is rated in poor condition 
house agriculture committee chairman e kika de la garza 
dtexas called for bipartisan action in cooperation with the 
administration to make sure that the federal government responds 
to the catastrophe that many american farmers today face 
he said the task force goals should be to assess the droughts 
impact on trade and food prices and to formulate an aid package for 
farmers 
we have to have a battle plan before too long said sen 
david pryor dark he said the panel must not neglect the health 
effects a longprotracted heat wave has on the rural elderly 
sen howell heflin dala declared that it was time for the 
federal government to join with local governments and the private 
sector in providing irrigation assistance to farmers 
some use of the federal crop insurance program to aid 
droughtstricken farmers was suggested by sens tom harkin diowa 
and thad cochran rmiss 
the signup deadline for the crop insurance program has long 
since expired and in many cases the crops already have begun 
growing but the lawmakers said there still might be a way

special road passes and extra gas rations are 
being issued while mule trains and tractor caravans stand poised to 
quench beijings voracious summer appetite for watermelons 
beijing area farmers this year will produce 660 million pounds 
of watermelon for the capitals 10 million people up 20 percent 
from 1987 the official china daily quoted beijing vice mayor huang 
chao as saying 
huang said the city will bring in another 110 million pounds 
from other provinces to ward off any possibility of lastminute 
shortages 
the report said the peak for beijings annual summertime craving 
for watermelons will come on july 10 when fruit stands peddler 
carts and food stores will be weighed down with about 44 million 
pounds of the fruit 
to cope with transport problems 23 streets have been designated 
as routes for outoftown trucks carrying watermelons from july 1 
to nov 15 tractors and muledrawn carts normally banned from 
city streets will be allowed to haul in their crop between 8 pm 
and 4 am from june 25 to aug 5 
watermelons or western melons in chinese are grown 
throughout northern and western china tradition has it that the 
sweetest hail from the hot dry climes of western gansu province 
near the dunhuang caves 
chinese have elevated the act of choosing a melon for ripeness 
and taste to an art form and often spend several minutes handling 
shaking and listening to and smelling the melons before they make a 
purchase 
the china daily in a 1982 ode to what chinese call the king 
of melons said it is used traditionally as a preventive tonic 
against sunstroke and heat exhaustion and it is good for 
chronic diseases like high blood pressure pyelitis hepatitis and 
cholecystitis 
the chinese take their watermelon so seriously that last year 
two men were sentenced to life imprisonment for leading 100 vendors 
in the theft of 55000 pounds of watermelon from a beijing train 
depot 
the taste for watermelon has created other social problems last 
summer beijing sanitation workers had to dispose of about 50000 
tons of rinds in shanghai chinas largest city about 1000 
people were treated in hospitals during one summer month after 
tripping on discarded rinds

columnist carl t rowan says race isnt the 
issue in the controversy over his shooting of a white teenage 
intruder at his home but black activists and other members of the 
public arent so sure 
anybody who is threatening my family becomes my enemy 
rowan who is black said on a syndicated television show being 
aired today i dont care if he is black white blue or green 
since the shooting attention has focused on rowans use of a 
gun that was not properly registered according to district of 
columbia law and talk has centered on whether rowan would be 
charged with a gun violation 
the washington post citing unidentified law enforcement 
sources reported in todays editions that district of columbia 
police on friday requested an arrest warrant charging rowan with 
unlawful possession of a handgun but that the us attorneys 
office intervened because its investigation was not concluded 
because police charges of unlawful entry against two teenagers 
caught at rowans home were withdrawn pending further investigation 
by the us attorney some members of the public have presumed the 
youths are off the hook and that has stirred public reaction 
democratic presidential candidate jesse jackson suggested to 
editors of the post on thursday that the intruders because they 
are white and from the affluent suburb of chevy chase md are 
presumed innocent 
district of columbia councilmember jim nathanson who represents 
the area in which rowan lives said i agree that there is a 
racial issue in terms of those kids but its also a class thing 
radio station wol callin host ben dudley said he received 35 or 
40 calls thursday supporting rowans action from his predominantly 
black working class audience 
its getting a lot of attention because a wealthy black man 
shot a white teenager said dudley all of those people were 
very supportive of mr rowans right to support his property 
in much of the black community the reaction is one of anger 
and disgust said calvin rolark a longtime community activist 
whoever heard of someone breaking onto someones property at 2 
am and having charges against them dropped immediately 
the us attorneys office would not comment friday on the 
status of its investigation a source in the us attorneys 
office speaking on condition of anonymity said the federal 
prosecutor could renew the charges or press lesser or more serious 
charges 
when rowan was asked about the racial aspects of the shooting 
during the inside washington television talk show he said 
i can understand why there is some anger in the black 
community but i dont want to get into a position of whipping up 
racial frenzy over this case this is a simple matter of a husband 
and a head of a household doing what he had to do regardless of 
whos out there 
the television program syndicated by postnewsweek stations 
inc is scheudled to be broadcast starting today at various times 
around the country 
rowan using a gun belonging to his son a former fbi agent 
shot 18yearold ben smith in the wrist when smith confronted him 
at his door 
authorities said smith had been swimming uninvited in rowans 
pool and the commotion awakened rowan smiths companion laura 
bachman 19 of bethesda md also was arrested but charges 
against her were also dropped other teenagers allegedly in the 
group got away

vice president george bush heading to illinois to see what the 
drought is doing to farmers and to address state republicans is 
vowing anyone convicted in the pentagon fraud case will feel the 
full force of the law if bush wins the white house democratic 
presidential nomineetobe michael dukakis touching prime southern 
bases promises a nosurrender fight against drugs 
i will not tolerate lawlessness in the pentagon in the 
streets or in the congress bush said in washington friday about 
allegations of corruption in pentagon procurement programs 
the public should know that a bush administration will see to 
it that any and all charges are aggressively prosecuted and that 
the full force of the law is applied to anyone convicted bush 
added 
the defense probe concerns the alleged sale of confidential 
pentagon information to military contractors through their paid 
consultants 
bush the allbutcertain gop presidential nominee planned to 
stop by a droughthit farm today and speak at the republican state 
convention in springfield ill bush won the illinois primary march 
15 
meanwhile dukakis the massachusetts governor who has been on a 
campaign march through the south arranged to attend the funeral of 
hispanic leader willie velasquez today in san antonio texas and 
then to address the democratic state convention in houston 
dukakis the texas primary winner march 8 had been scheduled to 
be introduced at the convention by velasquez who died wednesday 
velasquez is credited with registering thousands of hispanic voters 
jesse jackson planned to speak today to the illinois democratic 
convention in springfield and then go to an extended black family 
reunion in philadelphia 
dukakis went to mississippi on friday to propose setting up a 
national alliance against drugs to be headed by the president 
aimed at producing drugfree schools in every community in 
america in the 1990s 
nobody is going to tell me we have to run up the white flag of 
surrender on this issue he told the mississippi municipal 
association convention in biloxi 
theres a sense that things are out of control in the effort 
to deal with the nations drug situation he said and our 
citizens cant walk down the street and buy a bottle of milk 
without being in fear of their lives 
in other political developments friday 
sen sam nunn dga said he has informed the dukakis campaign 
that he is not interested in becoming the democratic vice 
presidential nominee however nunn stopped short of saying he 
would refuse to accept the nomination if offered to him by dukakis 
i think its very presumptuous to sort of set up a 
hypothetical example of what one would do if one were offered 
something that one is not seeking and one is discouraging nunn 
said so i havent gone to the extent of making a shermanlike 
statement i feel its kind of presumptuous and at this stage 
unnecessary 
maureen reagan the presidents daughter said in coeur 
dalene idaho that bush should at least consider a woman as a 
running mate 
despite her statement she said she would not press the issue 
with bush i didnt impose my opinion on ronald reagan in 1980 
so i dont think i ought to impose my opinion on george bush in 
1988 she said 
dukakis was endorsed by mississippi gov ray mabus who said 
that in a decade that has sanctified selfishness mike dukakis 
has reminded us of our interdependence and our responsibility to 
each other 
religious broadcaster pat robertson urged conservative 
minnesota republicans who had backed his unsuccessful presidential 
candidacy to support bush in november 
robertson said it matters whether the man in the white house 
is a mediocre liberal who returns us to the policies of jimmy 
carter or a distinguished conservative who builds upon the 
foundation of a great republican ronald reagan

a delegation of lawmakers will go to iran this 
weekend at that countrys invitation to explore ways of freeing 
british hostages held in lebanon 
however an official of the church of england which organized 
the trip said friday that the four legislators would not conduct 
formal negotiations for the release of the men apparently held by 
proiranian kidnappers 
during the fourday visit to the iranian capital of tehran 
beginning sunday the legislators will meet highranking iranian 
officials 
the four lawmakers in the mission are cyril townsend and robert 
hicks of the governing conservative party thomas clarke of the 
labor party and lord tordoff of the social liberal democrats 
clarke said the invitation had come from parliament speaker 
hashemi rafsanjani 
diplomatic ties between britain and iran were reduced to 
caretaker status a year ago but showed signs of improving when the 
countries agreed during talks in london last week to compensate 
each other for damages to their diplomatic offices 
the iranian embassy building at londons princes gate caught 
fire when british commandos stormed it in 1980 to end a hostage 
siege british diplomatic buildings and the british embassy in iran 
were damaged by mobs in 1978 1979 and 1980 
 
the british foreign office said the lawmakers trip was 
privately organized we have been informed but not consulted 
said an official there who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the group is not going to negotiate for the return of 
hostages said eve keatley a spokeswoman for archbishop of 
canterbury robert runcie the spiritual leader of the church of 
england also known as the anglican church 
it is a factfinding mission to find ways to improve relations 
with iran which could lead to the freeing of terry waite and the 
other british hostages she said 
waite 49 runcies personal envoy disappeared in beirut 17 
months ago while on his fifth mission to try to win the release of 
westerners abducted in lebanon 
most of the 18 missing foreigners are believed to be held 
captive by the hezbollah or party of god an iranianbacked 
militant shiite moslem faction 
nine of the missing are americans including the longestheld 
hostage terry anderson chief middle east correspondent of the 
associated press he was kidnapped in beirut march 16 1985 
other britons who were kidnapped are john mccarthy 31 a 
television journalist abducted april 17 1986 as he drove to 
beirut airport to fly home and alec collett 64 a new yorkbased 
journalist who disappeared march 25 1985 while on assignment for 
the un relief and works agency 
an islamic extremist organization claimed collett had been 
killed but his body has not been found and there has been no proof 
that he is dead 
brian keenan 36 born in the british province of northern 
ireland but holding a republic of ireland passport was abducted 
april 11 1986 he was walking at the time to the american 
university of beirut where he worked as an english teacher 
the mother and sisters of keenan appealed friday to the 
kidnappers to declare their demands for his release the appeal 
published in the annahar newspaper said we are poor people but 
are willing to do everything we can to help brian 
prime minister margaret thatcher has stressed her determination 
not to pay ransom to the captors of britons waite who had helped 
free three american hostages in lebanon left instructions 
forbidding any ransom payment if he was kidnapped 
mrs keatley said the anglican church has repeatedly made it 
clear we are not prepared to be party to any deal which would 
indicate in any way that hostagetaking pays dividends

the white house aids commissions final 
report made up of two crucial sections stitched together at the 
end of a marathon session calls on president reagan to designate a 
single government official to head the national fight against the 
epidemic 
the13 member panel spent two days going over the nearly 600 
specific recommendations in the 269page report wordbyword but 
wound up making no major changes from two draft versions issued 
earlier this month 
however the decision to stick with a call for federal 
legislation to prohibit discrimination against people infected with 
the deadly virus barely survived a final formal vote 
although all commissioners expressed support for the sentiment 
during informal discussions last week when the final vote was 
taken only seven of the 12 present backed the proposal being 
pushed strongly by retired navy adm james d watkins the panel 
chairman 
he told reporters later it would have made it very difficult 
for us to feel we had done a good job if that provision had been 
lost 
watkins has said repeatedly that strong antidiscrimination 
legislation lies at the heart of many other things that need to be 
done to combat the epidemic such as more widespread testing 
comprehensive federal antidiscrimination legislation which 
prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities in the 
public and private sectors including employment housing public 
accommodations and participation in government programs should be 
enacted says the recommendation that survived the narrow vote 
all persons with symptomatic or asymptomatic hiv infection should 
be clearly included as persons with disabilities who are covered by 
their antidiscrimination protections of this legislation 
it was several hours after the key antidiscrimination vote 
shortly before midnight before the panel finally agreed on its 
recommendations for administrative changes and the wording of an 
executive summary that highlights what the commission viewed as its 
major recommendations 
neither had been available previously in draft form 
the summary notes that we are a long way from all the 
answers despite what it called an unprecedented research effort 
to find a cure or vaccine for the disease 
the human immunodeficiency virus hiv epidemic will be a 
challenging factor in american life for years to come and should be 
a concern to all americans said the opening line of the final 
report recent estimates suggest that almost 500000 americans 
will have died or progressed to later stages of the disease by 
1992 
the final chapter guidance for the future was a 
compromise blending several more specific options into general 
recommendations although watkins had considerable success in 
seeing most of his recommendations adopted the commission 
specifically rejected his original suggestion to invest sweeping 
new powers in the surgeon generals office 
the version to be delivered to the white house next friday will 
simply say commissioners believe that some special management 
oversight entity is needed at this early juncture in the epidemic 
to see that an action plan to carry out the strategy is 
aggressively followed 
the report said the president should quickly appoint a 
continuing external oversight committee to provide an ongoing 
evaluation of the nations response to the epidemic 
and it said he should clearly establish the chain of command 
from the cabinet to all affected units of the federal government 
with a single designated official to manage implementation of this 
report and related activities within the existing structure 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious 
disease that attacks the bodys immune system rendering it 
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections no one is 
known to have recovered from aids which most often is spread 
through close contact with blood blood products or semen from 
infected people its chief victims have been homosexual men and 
intravenous drug users 
as of june 13 aids had been diagnosed in 64896 americans of 
whom more than half or 36480 have died since june 1981 according 
to the federal centers for disease control

leftist rebels have issued a call for a 
90day ceasefire and direct talks with the government to end more 
than 25 years of civil warfare 
there was no indication on friday that the civilian government 
of president vinicio cerezo will accept the rebels latest call to 
renew peace talks the first round ever held in 27 years of war 
took place last october in madrid spain without visible results 
the influential military which held direct control of the 
government until permitting cerezos inauguration in january 1986 
opposes more talks 
a scheduled meeting between the rebels and a national 
reconciliation commission was canceled after a failed military coup 
in may 
the text of the letter from the commanders of the rebel 
coalition guatemalan national revolutionary union to the head of 
the reconciliation commission was published in the daily newspapers 
el grafico and prensa libre friday 
the letter accuses the government of defying a regional peace 
plan signed by cerezo and the presidents of four other central 
american nations last year the accord calls for negotiations to 
end the regions civil wars of which guatemalas is the longest 
the rebel unions statement says the army has secretly 
intensified the war in a bid for allout victory 
the rebel commanders propose direct highlevel talks with the 
government during a ceasefire that would begin on july 1 the 
talks would focus on human rights guarantees and on a schedule for 
dismantling the instruments of control of the population that now 
exist 
human rights groups accuse the military of committing massive 
violations in a bloody antiguerrilla campaign that began in the 
late 1970s the violence has diminished but selective killings and 
disappearances are still reported 
in the letter the guerrillas also set out their conditions for 
a political solution to guatemalas conflict they said the 
government must recognize the historical causes of the conflict 
demonstrate a desire to end the war and recognize the rebel union 
as a party to any negotiated settlement

the chance to swim with a pod of 
dolphins and even hop a ride on a passing dorsal fin has tourists 
lining up at attractions in the florida keys but some 
environmental activists worry the animals will be exploited 
three attractions and a resort in the keys charge as much as 50 
each to tourists who have been on waiting lists for more than a 
month to take their 15minute dolphin encounter 
where else are you able to get up close and feel the dolphins 
skin and experience its gentleness and the way it uses its 
echolocation systems said mike wood curator of theater of the 
seas ocean park in islamorada people leave here with a whole new 
appreciation for these animals its a tremendous educational 
experience 
stormy and genie the attractions two 7footlong atlantic 
bottlenose dolphins have splashed along with 12 swimmers every day 
for the past year they appear to relish the human contact 
nuzzling kisses on the cheeks of young women wagging their 
powerful tails to stand in the water and dance and even flying 
out of the water to turn somersaults above swimmers heads 
the dolphins chirp and click after each task until the trainer 
has rewarded them with fish the wideeyed tourists come away with 
spectacular photographs and a few minutes theyll never forget 
this is something ive wanted to do my whole life and now i 
can say ive done it alan larosee of north providence ri 
said as he climbed out of the oceanside landlocked lagoon 
but the environmental group greenpeace is not as enthusiastic 
it views any public display of dolphins for profit as 
exploitative and is calling for government regulation of swim 
programs 
the dolphin swims in the keys have been very popular and 
thats been encouraging several big resorts around the country to 
think about capturing dolphins for a program of their own said 
lesley scheele of the fort lauderdale chapter of greenpeace 
our concern is that this could escalate to the point where 
everybody trying to lure a tourist is applying to capture dolphins 
for a swim program she said this could end up putting a major 
strain on wild populations 
dolphins have been a protected species since 1972 under the 
marine mammal protection act which allows for the tightly 
controlled capture of dolphins for public display 
but the law doesnt specifically address dolphin encounters 
or how they should be operated 
ive seen some places where they dump 10 people in the water 
and theyre all grabbing at one dolphin all the animal wants to 
do is get away said chip hershaw a trainer at the nonprofit 
dolphin research center on grassy key which has operated a swim 
program for three years 
theres a right way and and wrong way to go about it he 
said 
theater of the seas dolphin research center and dolphins plus 
in key largo are the only places that have been granted federal 
display permits along with special experimental permits to run the 
swim programs while hawks cay resort operates dolphin swims with 
only a display permit said brian gorman a spokesman for the 
national marine fisheries service in washington dc 
the regulatory agency has conducted public hearings on the issue 
here and in washington and has appointed an expert panel to come up 
with a set of dolphin encounter guidelines gorman said 
until those rules are issued expected by midsummer the 
fisheries service has ordered a moratorium on any more dolphin swim 
programs that has delayed plans by a hyatt hotel in hawaii to 
capture six dolphins for swims with guests gorman said 
ideally wed like to see the dolphin swims restricted to only 
nonprofit research facilities places where theres a real 
educational mission said ms scheele of greenpeace anytime 
profit is the main motive theres a possibility of abuse 
the group has also recommended that any swim facility be set up 
to allow dolphins to come and go from the wild freely and not be 
forced to interact with humans said bo bricklemyer a greenpeace 
attorney in washington 
there may also be health risks when humans swim with dolphins 
ms scheele said since it is not known exactly what is causing a 
virus that has killed hundreds of dolphins in the last year along 
the east coast she said there has been no proof that dolphins and 
humans have exchanged such viruses 
wood of theater of the seas agrees there should be some 
regulation but he feels many checks are already in place to 
protect dolphins and said forprofit attractions can help in that 
effort 
the whole idea that were out to rape the oceans of all the 
dolphins is incredibly misleading he said the federal 
government nowadays makes it a long arduous and expensive process 
just to get the approval to capture a dolphin theres no way the 
law would allow a big run on dolphins 
federal law allows fewer than 100 dolphins to be taken for 
scientific or public display purposes every year yet as many as 
12500 dolphins are allowed to be incidentally killed in nets 
in the commercial harvests of tuna and other fish gorman said 
the number of dolphins that could ever be taken for swim 
programs is a drop in the bucket wood said greenpeace has 
their priorities way out of line here its programs like ours that 
create the awareness to save the dolphins that are really 
endangered 
were not getting rich off the dolphin swim program either 
he said if we wanted to get rich we could run this like a ride 
at disney world we would never allow that to happen

two hundred years ago tuesday the federal 
constitution became the supreme law of the united states when 
after months of bickering new hampshire cast the ninth and 
deciding vote to ratify 
the decision laid the top stone to the grand federal edifice 
and happily raised the ninth pillar rejoiced the new hampshire 
gazette based in the federalist stronghold of portsmouth the 13 
states had decided at the constitutional convention in philadelphia 
that nine votes were needed to ratify 
at a party the following week nine candles were lit in each 
window of the portsmouth statehouse and a band played 
language is too poor to describe the universal joy that glowed 
in every countenance the gazette reported 
but if the wealthy traders and military elite of the seacoast 
celebrated the establishment of a stronger national government the 
lesseducated antifederalists in the central parts of the state 
grudgingly accepted their defeat in the 5747 ratification vote 
it is adopted said joshua atherton of exeter key spokesman 
of the antifederalists who initially commanded a majority let 
us try it 
the vote capped a bitter debate between federalists who argued 
that a strong government was needed to provide stability and pull 
the country out of a recession and their opponents who believed 
the constitution laid the groundwork for the kind of tyrannical 
central government they fought in the revolution 
in february 1788 new hampshire had held a constitutional 
convention in which atherton had the votes needed to reject the 
document had federalists not scrambled to adjourn the exeter 
meeting new hampshire might have earned the distinction of being 
the first state to reject the constitution 
with rhode islands rejection following two in a row it just 
could have blunted the whole process said dartmouth historian 
jere daniell 
atherton a harvardeducated lawyer who had been a british 
loyalist in the early years of the war argued that the 
constitution threatened the state power and personal liberties he 
also argued fervently against a federal judiciary 
when he rose to speak he whipped a cape around him struck 
dramatic postures and naturally made himself obnoxious to 
supporters of the constitution wrote charles bell in the bench 
and bar of new hampshire 
john quincy adams who came up from massachusetts for the 
debates found atherton a miserable speaker and a worse 
reasoner 
others found atherton more compelling including abolitionists 
who later credited him with strong opposition to the section of the 
constitution that allowed slavery 
religion was another potent issue some in new hampshire thought 
federal law should mirror their states requirement until 1877 
that officeholders provide proof of protestant affiliation 
the proposed two and sixyear federal legislative terms also 
frightened antifederalists who saw the states oneyear terms as 
more reasonable 
thirtyeight delegates arrived at the convention with binding 
orders from their towns to reject the constitution 
but such federalists as john langdon an international trader 
who represented the state at the constitutional convention john 
sullivan a former general and president of new hampshire and 
samuel livermore a superior court chief justice had strong 
personal and political skills 
newspapers were inundated with federalist articles emphasizing 
the inefficiency of interstate trade devastating unemployment and 
the inability to defend frontier areas under the articles of 
confederation 
several capitalized on athertons tory past accusing him of 
wishing to prevent the adoption of a system only because it will 
put it out of the power of britain to subjugate us 
federalist politicking was aided by the momentum of eight states 
delaware pennsylvania new jersey georgia connecticut 
massachusetts maryland and south carolina standing behind the 
document 
eight states have already adopted it and should we but make 
the ninth would it not be much to our credit asked a letter in 
the gazette 
the race to cast the decisive vote was with virginia which also 
was meeting in june in richmond 
when delegates gathered in concords old north meeting house on 
june 18 1788 federalist leaders knew they had the numbers to win 
they wanted a speedy vote but atherton stalled arguing that only 
with a 12item addendum of rights should the constitution pass 
to ratify it without requiring a bill of rights he said was 
to surrender our all and then ask our new masters if they will 
be so gracious as to return to us some or any part of our most 
important rights and privileges 
the ploy failed and the convention moved for a vote on 
accepting the constitution unconditionally though with a 
recommendation of future passage of the bill of rights 
the final vote on june 21 approved the constitution by a margin 
of 10 surprising even the most optimistic proconstitution 
strategists 
convention secretary john calfe recorded the time 1 pm in 
case virginia disputed it and a letter was dispatched to richmond 
five days later before the letter arrived virginia became the 
10th state to approve the constitution new york followed in july 
north carolina and rhode island recognizing they already were 
ruled by a document they hadnt approved ratified in 1789 and 1790

the commuter train zips along at 
50 miles an hour on top of a car a young man stands up and waves 
his arms like a bird in flight 
the slightest slip could mean a fatal fall the slightest jolt 
could mean contact with a 3000volt electrical wire overhead 
nevertheless paulo evaristo 15 and hundreds of other youths 
from rio de janeiros poor outlying suburbs risk their lives every 
day showing off their skills in what is known as train surfing 
some 150 train surfers were killed last year 40 in the first 
five months of this year 
the government company that runs the commuter trains has had to 
pay the equivalent of 700000 in claims filed by the survivors of 
youths killed or by youths who have been injured more than 400 
young men were injured in 1987 some permanently paralyzed 
these people are seeking new thrills but in my opinion 
theyre suicidal said helio barros spokesman for the railroad 
he added that efforts to discourage the train surfers have failed 
with the money we spent on claims we could have repaired 10 
trains he said he added that the railroad is trying to persuade 
judges not to validate claims in cases of trainsurfing accidents 
ive been doing this since i was 13 said paulo evaristo 
you get a feeling of freedom that is greater than any fear 
paulo evaristo is a gradeschool dropout and works as a 
messenger he declined to give his last name in an interview 
train surfers come from poor neighborhoods and some brazilian 
newspapers have speculated the young people are trying to emulate 
the sea surfers at wealthy beachfront districts such as copacabana 
and ipanema the newspaper accounts also have suggested the surfers 
ride train roofs because they cant afford the 15cruzado 8cent 
fare or that theres no room in the crowded trains which 
transport 12 million passengers daily 
but barros the railroad spokesman dismissed all these 
arguments 
its strictly for the fun he said in the first place 
you have to pay the fare to get inside the train stations and even 
when its not rush hour and there are plenty of seats you still 
see these kids on top of the cars 
the train company has assigned 200 guards a day to try to stop 
train surfers but the guards are not enough to cover the commuter 
systems 450 miles of track and 110 stations 
when they do arrest a train surfer the penalty is a fine 
equivalent to 1 and a lecture from a government psychologist 
the purpose is not to jail these people barros said it 
is to save their lives 
chief fernando rodrigues de almeida of the police precinct of 
the engenho novo neighborhood ordered 11 train surfers jailed 
without bail on charges of obstructing railroad traffic 
but a judge ruled that train surfing was not a crime but rather 
an act of selfinjury similar to attempted suicide and not 
dealt with in the brazilian legal code 
the judge reprimanded the chief for abuse of authority 
were not crazy and were not bums either said train 
surfer luiz claudio 18 an apprentice lathe operator who makes 70 
a month slightly more than the minimum wage were just looking 
for a little fun to pass the time during the train ride 
elizabeth 19 a maid who like luiz claudio would not tell her 
last name said she sometimes rides on top of the commuter trains 
because the atmosphere inside the cars is violent with 
frequent muggings but she added its a lot of fun too 
barros the railroad spokesman said train surfers have always 
been a problem but the practice reached an alltime high last year 
he added that the suburb of nilopolis has a train surfers 
association with three tests for membership 1 ride hanging from 
the outside of a window or door 2 climb up a car in motion and 
lie on the roof 3 stand on the roof of a moving car 
the founder of the association known as rambo was killed when 
he fell from a train 
another member of the group who was killed had a membership card 
in his pocket 
it said evanil dos santos passed his test and is authorized 
to hang from trains

for 20 years barth green struggled 
with his frustration doctoring crushed and twisted spinal cords 
while knowing paralysis was permanent and irreversible 
spinal cord injuries doomed active healthy people to spend the 
rest of their lives in wheelchairs in the worst cases they cant 
out of bed pull on socks or underwear brush their teeth comb 
their hair lift a forkful of food to their mouths or scratch an 
itch 
but green made a lousy fatalist 
in 1985 he founded the miami project to cure paralysis 
dedicated to reversing one of the most catastrophic conditions in 
medicine by solving the mystery of one of the most complex 
structures in biology today it is the countrys largest and most 
comprehensive spinal cord research unit 
no ones ever had the guts to say we want to cure paralysis 
but im committed to eliminating wheelchairs its a world war 
against paralysis said green a neurosurgeon 
our philosophy is to approach it like the manhattan project to 
split atoms to stop hitler or the apollo project to put a man on 
the moon in the space race 
in an era when miracle drugs transplant surgery laser beams 
and artificial body parts have made medicine seem capable of 
solving almost anything paralysis remains stubbornly unconquered 
researchers have made progress toward regenerating nerves in 
animals spinal cords with transplants of cells from fetuses 
electrical pulses and genetic engineering 
but some say the challenge may be tougher than building atomic 
bombs or space ships 
those were engineering problems with a general consensus it 
could be done those guys had blueprints we dont have any 
blueprints said dr walter levy a researcher at the miami 
project 
were in the wright brothers stage whats required is a space 
shuttle said dr michael kliot a neurosurgeon at columbia 
presbyterian hospital in new york city theres a ray of hope 
but were very very far away from curing spinal cord injuries 
an estimated 250000 to 500000 people in the united states are 
paralyzed as a result of injuries according to the department of 
health and human services an additional 10000 to 15000 people 
are hurt each year no agency keeps precise count 
auto accidents account for about half the paralysis cases other 
causes are dives falls and accidents with guns and knives or 
while playing sports 
the average age of victims is 19 
marc buoniconti son of former allpro football linebacker nick 
buoniconti of the miami dolphins was 19 when his neck broke and 
crushed his spinal cord as he made a headfirst tackle paralyzing 
him from the neck down oct 26 1985 
i knew i broke my neck right away said buoniconti who had 
played football since he was a 75pound 7yearold my right arm 
flopped to the turf i couldnt move i couldnt get my breath 
back i couldnt talk 
in one second i went from the best shape of my life to the 
worst buoniconti said i was taking my last steps doing my 
favorite thing it was on a football field the place i love the 
most 
now from his wheelchair at home in this miami suburb the 
21yearold buoniconti is tackling paralysis as national spokesman 
for the miami project the projects logo is a fourframe sequence 
of a stick figure standing up out of a wheelchair matching the 
cando grit of buonicontis personalized license plate that reads 
ill walk 
its not a question of if thats not in our vocabulary 
its a question of when said steve towle the projects 
executive director and a former dolphins linebacker ive seen 
what it takes to win it can be done it will be done 
the spinal cord encased in the bony armor of the spinal column 
is as wide as a thumb and has the consistency of jellied candy

david was sleeping on the streets and 
working as a prostitute the 16yearolds parents had left him 
behind when they moved from alaska 
geanne also 16 got pregnant and ran away from her athabascan 
indian village in anchorage she turned to prostitution and was 
often beaten by her pimp she died of a drug overdose 
there are others enough to give this city of 230000 residents 
one of the nations highest percapita rates of runaway and 
homeless youths at least 1200 teenagers are reported as runaways 
each year in anchorage more than three times the number for 
comparable cities a 1986 municipal study found 
we are not a large city yet we have a very large problem 
said marj hall director of the alaska juvenile crime commission 
where davids and geannes cases are on file confidentiality 
restrictions prevented use of their last names 
the statistics and the troubled young faces behind them 
grabbed the attention of covenant house a nonprofit group that 
until now focused on running shelters in larger cities such as new 
york and houston 
this summer in anchorage covenant house is turning a beatup 
old ymca building into a 40bed shelter where runaways can sort out 
their lives and perhaps avoid the deadend world of life on the 
street 
covenant houses arrival is lauded by local social workers 
frustrated by a lack of longterm care for runaways but some warn 
the shelter expected to open in october is no panacea 
they say anchorages runaways are part of a greater malaise 
arising from alaskas frontier demographics a young transient 
population isolated from stabilizing family and community ties in 
the lower 48 states 
kids dont have the extended family network here hall said 
if they get into trouble they cant go to uncle charlie who 
theyve known since they were a pup 
a boombust economy contributes to social instability as does 
the cultural upheaval besetting alaskas 14percent native 
population 
the result alaska consistently places at or near the top of the 
charts in percapita rates of drug and alcohol abuse rape child 
abuse divorce suicide assault and domestic violence 
trouble at home gives some alaska youths good reason to run but 
once on the street they face bigger trouble as easy targets for 
drugpushers pimps and sexual exploiters 
in the early 1980s when north slope oil revenues swelled state 
budgets officials increased funding for social programs but 
social workers say little went toward helping runaway kids today 
anchorage has only 10 beds available for runaways and now that the 
oil boom has busted government money is hard to come by 
enter covenant house the group started 19 years ago in new york 
city when the rev bruce ritter a franciscan priest started 
letting street kids sleep on his apartment floor today covenant 
house runs shelters in six cities and provides food clothing 
medical care and counseling to more than 20000 youths a year 
covenant house officials are asked why theyre opening shop in 
anchorage when other larger cities have bigger and more visible 
runaway populations 
we were invited answered brenda moscarella the alaska 
project manager the roman catholic archdiocese of anchorage raised 
enough money to buy the building and told ritter it was his if 
covenant house would open a shelter ritter took the bait 
the future covenant house alaska is now a bombshell of a 
building said fred ali the alaska programs executive director 
in the next few months workers will transform it into a homey 
shelter with bedrooms upstairs and a dining hall clinic lounge 
and chapel downstairs 
ali has begun the search for a 40member staff of doctors 
childcare workers cooks and counselors operating costs are 
expected to run just over 1 million a year most of which will 
come from covenant houses national fundraising efforts 
though the organization has strong religious ties runaways are 
not proselytized moscarella said god is one more father figure 
and they ran away from that she said 
covenant house alaska may differ a little from the groups other 
operations ali said hes looking for staff comfortable with 
alaskas native culture and moscarella said the usual 930 pm 
curfew may have to be extended in summer when even toddlers stay 
out to play under the latenight sun 
but the blend of love and discipline that distinguishes other 
covenant house shelters will apply here moscarella said no 
weapons drugs or violence will be allowed and kids will have to 
do chores and adhere to progress plans mapped out by counselors 
the goals of those plans may be returning teenagers home 
helping them land jobs or sending them to drug counseling 
nationwide covenant house claims a 35 percent success rate in 
meeting those goals moscarella said 
some dispute that success saying covenant house actually 
encourages runaways 
i dont think it will help said allen 17 a runaway and 
former drugpusher who now helps the alaska juvenile crime 
commission counsel youths on the street its going to make kids 
more likely to run away because theyll know they have some place 
to stay 
and the police who handle runaway reports say many anchorage 
runaways are not in great danger investigator ronald emmons said 
at least 90 percent fit into the spoiled brat or free 
spirit category rebellious kids who run because theyre told to 
take out the garbage or vacuum the carpet 
these manipulators generally return home after wearing out their 
welcome at friends houses and covenant house may not get through 
to them emmons said to them it might just mean a picnic for 30 
days he said 
but ali and moscarella said covenant house is hardheaded enough 
to deal with manipulators and openminded enough to take all 
comers spoiled brat or not 
that kid may start off as a spoiled brat ali said but 
those kids are at risk just like anybody else there is child 
prostitution in this town and there are kids running drugs the 
streets not a safe place to be

despite sometimes conflicting signals the us 
economy appears healthy through the first six months of 1988 
the manufacturing sector has rebounded the merchandise trade 
deficit has been pared significantly even the stock market has 
showed occasional signs of strength 
the trend to growth is definitely there pierre ellis 
senior economist with the boston co economic advisors inc 
observed this past week 
most economists on wall street and inside corporate america now 
agree that economic growth should continue apace at least through 
the presidential election season 
but for the aging economic expansion now in its sixth year it 
may be a march into the woods not out 
while the chills from last octobers stock market crash have 
dissipated somewhat worries about inflation persist as the economy 
grows strong enough to put pressure on dwindling factory capacity 
observers say interest rates could be pushed upward even before 
the november election and wild cards like the drought could force 
the federal reserve to play its hand and tighten credit 
we are not home free said david jones an economist with 
the investment firm aubrey g lanston amp co in new york 
statistics released this past week show an economy drawing its 
equilibrium from a combination of strong production and sluggish 
consumption 
operating rates at american factories rose in may to 829 
percent the highest level in more than eight years industrial 
production also rose during the month and the merchandise trade 
deficit sank in april to its lowest point since december 1984 
such a revival might be inflationary were it not for retail 
sales which grew a lackluster 01 percent in may extending a long 
slump while that persistent sluggishness concerns retailers it is 
good news to economists who say the economy could well boil over 
if consumers spend too freely 
in the textbook view much is right with the current scenario 
the locomotive of growth is manufacturing not consumption capital 
spending by business is up consumer spending is down businesses 
are producing at peak levels but sales are not so frantic that 
demand is outstripping supply and driving prices skyhigh 
it is the best kind of growth you can get said jones 
noting the contrast with the early stages of the expansion when 
consumers were on a buying spree and snapping up lots of imports 
the danger this year was too much consumer spending not too 
little he said 
if spending picks up the pressure on the fed to tighten credit 
will likewise increase the fed has already made three small moves 
to snug the credit lines in the last three months and ellis said 
his firm predicts the central bank may have to act again before the 
end of the year 
other factors affecting the inflation picture appear mixed oil 
prices have been soft but the federal budget deficit remains 
naggingly high and the drought scorching americas farm belt could 
push food prices markedly higher later this year 
any indication of inflation puts pressure on the fed ellis 
said 
the nations manufacturers are nevertheless encouraged by this 
interlude of steady growth however long it may last 
lynn michaelis chief economist for weyerhaeuser co the lumber 
and paper giant said the economys performance has vindicated 
those who predicted better times despite the scare of black monday 
in the stock market 
the evidence proved the real dynamics of the economy were 
stronger than the market indicated said michaelis 
despite a soft housing market in the united states weyerhaeuser 
is selling more of its products abroad thanks to the dollars 
recent stability 
the company is part of the broad revival of american industry 
now showing up in government statistics manufacturing 
corporations aftertax profits averaged 63 cents per dollar of 
sales in the first three months of 1988 up 43 percent from the 
fourth quarter according to numbers released this past week 
but even the most fortunate manufacturers are moving ahead 
conservatively boeing co for instance with several 
multibilliondollar plane orders under its belt sees hurdles yet to 
clear said its chief of research william mcdonald wallace 
as the pressure builds on interest rates manufacturers will 
feel the pinch along with consumers wallace said 
the rate of return on new investment has to pay he said 
it may be harder to justify new capacity

interest rates plunged and soared this past week 
in rollercoaster fashion and running the controls was the nemesis 
of all bondholders inflation 
for the first half of the week the mood had been downright 
exhilarating bond prices registered one of their biggest gains of 
the year rising around 20 per 1000 face amount while yields 
hit twomonth lows on reports that substantial progress was being 
made in lowering the nations trade gap 
but it was easy come easy go nearly all those profits were 
lost by the end of the week and interest rates edged up past the 9 
percent level again amid concerns that overseas central banks were 
seeking a tighter clamp on credit to keep their economies from 
overheating 
runaway economic growth can lead to inflation which erodes the 
value of fixedincome securities like bonds and notes 
bond analysts and traders said they couldnt recall a more 
volatile period in recent months than this past week 
it seems like a lifetime really when you think about whats 
taken place said marshall b front an economist at stein roe amp 
farnham in chicago this has been a roller coaster of a week 
hardest hit by the rise and fall of bond prices and rates were 
those who had stayed out of the market despite a steady price gain 
since memorial day but decided it was time to invest after 
tuesdays positive trade data 
the report by the commerce department said the merchandise trade 
deficit shrank unexpectedly to 989 billion the lowest point 
since december 1984 most encouraging to bondholders was the fact 
the improvement came from a decline in imports rather than a rise 
in exports indicating that the inflation was under control 
a lot of people who had first gotten into the market in any 
significant way on tuesday were just demolished they had 
instantaneous losses elliott platt an economist for donaldson 
lufkin amp jenrette securities corp said noting the losses were 
felt by institutional and individual investors alike 
it was very disparaging to market psychology 
behind the selloff were reports out of west germany that the 
central bundesbank would raise a key interest rate amid growing 
concern about betterthanexpected economic growth in that country 
and recent weakness in the mark against the dollar 
analysts said bond traders were worried that japan and britain 
also would raise their rates to keep inflation in check and that 
the federal reserve would have to follow suit to remain 
competitive however in washington the fed indicated it was not 
making any significant policy changes right now 
adding another negative tone to the credit markets this past 
week was a government report showing the nations factories mines 
and utilities operated at 829 percent of capacity in may higher 
than at any time in the past eight years that indicated that the 
manufacturing sector was heating up 
the midwest drought also exacerbated inflation fears as 
agriculture futures soared in price although to a lesser degree 
than other factors analysts said when the drought first 
happened the market was saying uh oh its inflation platt 
said the market now is beginning to distinguish between 
inflation in agricultural prices and basic commodities such as base 
metals 
besides he said the markets realize theres little that could 
be done to prod mother nature a change in monetary policy isnt 
going to bring rain

consumers will begin feeling the midwestern drought in the form 
of higher food prices before the year is out but even severe crop 
losses wouldnt have a large impact on the overall inflation rate 
economists say 
irreversible damage already done to oat wheat and corn crops 
will add a half to a full percentage point to food inflation this 
year and help push food prices up 5 percent to 8 percent in 1989 
according to a variety of private and government experts 
but food purchased in grocery stores comprises less than 10 
percent of the variables in the consumer price index the 
governments broadest measure of household inflation so even a 10 
percent increase in food prices which is considered unlikely 
would raise the cpi by only 1 percentage point 
food inflation could get up into the doubledigit range next 
year under extreme conditions but even then i dont think this 
would lead to a round of rapid inflation increases said terry 
francl an economist with the american farm bureau in park ridge 
ill 
as for this year beryl sprinkel chairman of the presidents 
council of economic advisers said on thursday that a rise in food 
prices over the next six months would be offset by lower prices for 
other cpi components sprinkel said he wasnt changing his 
prediction for an overall 1988 inflation rate of 4 percent 
and in the near term beginning as early as next month 
consumers likely will see a sharp drop in meat prices as livestock 
producers sell off portions of their herds because of the high cost 
of feed grains and the scarcity of good grazing land 
the biggest unknown of course is how long the drought will 
last the national weather service has predicted a continuation of 
the unusually warm dry midwestern weather pattern through at least 
july 15 raising the possibility of a 2025 percent loss in corn 
yields as opposed to the 10 percent loss sustained to date 
soybeans plants which are both hardier and laterplanted than 
corn can hold out for a while longer experts say spring wheat 
crops have sustained heavy damage but yields of winter wheat which 
accounts for about 75 percent of all us wheat have been better 
than expected in some states where the harvest is under way 
futures traders on chicago kansas city and minneapolis 
commodities exchanges have been betting on a long dry spell and 
bidding up prices for future delivery of grains and soybeans on 
the chicago board of trade corn futures have risen about 40 
percent since may 1 while soybeans have advanced about 35 percent 
and cash prices have followed suit 
ewen wilson the agriculture departments assistant secretary 
for economics said consumers probably would see the earliest price 
increases in vegetable oils then in cereal products 
in fact kraft inc raised prices for margarine salad dressings 
and mayonnaise by 5 percent to 10 percent in january and february 
and kellogg co has raised its cereal prices by 5 percent on two 
occasions since the beginning of the year company spokesmen said 
higher commodity prices were a factor in those decisions 
but wilson and others said the price that food processors pay 
for raw commodities represents only about 30 percent of the retail 
price of the final products labor packaging marketing 
processing costs and transportation comprise the bulk of food costs 
i feel some of the consumer food companies are using the 
drought as a profitmaking situation for themselves said larry 
rus a spokesman for the st louisbased national corn growers 
association 
livestock consume almost half of the corn and nearly all of the 
soybean meal produced in the united states 
so the most significant increases in food prices will not appear 
until next year when meat supplies tighten as a result of the 
droughtrelated slaughter this year of animals especially cattle 
that would otherwise have been kept for breeding analysts said 
the net result this year abundant beef supplies through the 
summer and fall more than anyone expected and in 1989 a serious 
shortage said chuck levitt a cattle market analyst with 
shearson lehman hutton inc 
experts say abundant stockpiles will ensure against a physical 
shortage of grains and soybeans even if this years yields are 
extremely small 
and the higher prices could encourage a sharp increase in 
plantings next year and may bring into production some of the 60 
million acres idled this year under government pricesupport 
programs said raymond daniel an economist with the wefa group 
inc a consulting firm in bala cynwyd pa 
we could flood the market with food by the fall of 1989 
daniel said american agriculture has the ability to rebound

has wall streets socalled summer rally 
lost its sizzle or are stock prices merely simmering before the 
heat gets turned up 
the dow jones industrial average has climbed some 200 points 
since may 31 and this week alone the key index set two 
consecutive postcrash highs before tumbling on fears of higher 
interest rates 
but before assessing just what impact these events may have on 
what has been dubbed a summer rally astute market watchers note 
that the sultry season hasnt even begun 
its not summer yet said ronald daino a technical analyst 
at smith barney harris upham amp co noting the season officially 
gets under way on tuesday 
depending on how things go daino said these recent events 
could be looked back upon as part of an initial summer rally 
but hes not entirely convinced that is inevitable 
we still feel it requires some confirmation on whether the 
market will move higher daino said 
the potential is there but id just like some additional 
confirmation before putting both feet in the water he said 
pointing to the droughts effect on commodity prices and the credit 
markets as areas of concern 
plunging bond prices obliterated the 32point gain the dow 
posted in backtoback sessions this week that pushed the key 
average to two postcrash highs 
those who expected the dow jones average of 30 industrials to 
remain solidly above 2100 and use that mark as a springboard for a 
further advance saw those plans evaporate in one brief session 
rumors out of europe that west germany and even possibly japan 
are considering hiking interest rates ignited fears that the 
federal reserve might be forced to follow suit to support the 
dollar 
the news deflated the bond market and ripple effects spread to 
equities 
but analysts shrugged it off saying the stock market was 
overdue for a selloff that it needed a breather and that the 
overall trend is constructive 
over the week the dow rose 231 points to 210402 fridays 
volume of 34392 million shares on the new york stock exchange 
attributed to moves to capture dividends and the quarterly 
triplewitching hour was the busiest session this year and the 
fifth heaviest ever volume averaged 20164 million shares a day 
the nyse composite index was off 005 at 15284 the nasdaq 
composite index for the overthecounter market rose 067 to 
38692 and the american stock exchange market value index fell 
363 to 30570 
alfred goldman director of technical market analysis at ag 
edwards amp sons inc in st louis cautioned that he is both 
amazed and chagrined at how quickly pessimism has turned to 
optimism about everything 
a betterthanexpected trade deficit report which heartened 
investors because both imports and exports had declined in april 
should have been tempered with caution over factory utilization 
which edged up beyond expectations in may goldman said 
the implication is that booming business could result in 
shortages of some goods and price increases to compensate 
still investors hot to perpetuate the summer rally are 
tossing off concerns about an overheated economy 
everybody is looking up as far as the stock market is 
concerned goldman said thats a sign the market is 
overbought and overbelieved and that were getting into a 
highrisk area 
goldman noted that optimism breeds declines in the market while 
pessimism is fodder for rallies

the government has reported a surprising drop in may home 
building while the ongoing drought keeps pressure on commodities 
prices 
the commerce department said friday that apartment and house 
building plunged 122 percent last month as singlefamily home 
construction slumped to the lowest level in more than three years 
economists who were surprised by the steepness of the nose 
dive blamed rising interest rates and high home prices 
particularly in the northeast section of the country where 
construction starts fell 223 percent 
housing activity is closely watched because it often is a 
harbinger of the direction of the economy as a whole however 
analysts cautioned against overreacting to one months report and 
said they expected at least a modest rebound this summer 
the report had little effect on the stock market where the dow 
jones industrial average of 30 stocks rose 978 points to 210402 
trading of nearly 344 million shares on the new york stock 
exchange heaviest of the year was attributed to dividend plays 
and technical factors associated with triple witching hour 
expiration of futures and options contracts 
inflation fears continued to plague the credit markets where 
the yield on the 30year treasury bond edged above 9 percent 
the biggest moves in the financial markets were again in the 
commodities pits where soybean futures prices soared to 11year 
highs on the chicago board of trade and corn futures advanced the 
daily limit for the fourth consecutive session in anticipation of 
more dry weather and deeper crop losses lumber prices tumbled in 
reaction to the disappointing report on housing starts 
the commerce departments report said the may decline dragged 
overall housing construction down to a seasonally adjusted annual 
rate of 138 million units compared with a rate of 158 million 
units in april 
singlefamily construction dropped 92 percent to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 988000 after dipping 72 percent in april 
multifamily building starts a volatile category dropped 189 
percent to a rate of 396000 units in may bouncing off a 367 
percent increase a month earlier 
apartment building has been in the doldrums for more than a year 
because of high vacancy rates and changes in the tax law that made 
investment in rental housing less profitable 
it was the most precipitous drop in total housing construction 
since decembers 158 percent fall and the lowest level in activity 
since january 
construction of singlefamily units have not been lower since 
august 1984 when units were begun at a 967000 annual rate 
mortgage interest rates were rising pretty quickly during the 
month of may and that rise may have scared a lot of builders into 
pulling back said richard w peach deputy chief economist of 
the mortgage bankers of america 
according to the federal home loan mortgage corp rates on 
30year fixed rate mortgages climbed from an average of 1005 
percent early in april to 1058 percent late in may the averages 
do not include addon fees known as points 
rates have eased so far this month averaging 1035 percent this 
week however most economists are predicting rising rates through 
the end of the year

texaco inc officials say theyre confident 
they have won their proxy war against carl c icahn but the wily 
financier who is also the oil giants biggest shareholder says he 
thinks it could go either way 
top executives of the nations thirdlargest oil company and 
icahn who owns 148 percent of texacos 243 million outstanding 
shares were speaking after the companys annual meeting here 
friday 
icahns pursuit of five of texacos 14 board seats has been 
closely watched by shareholders and the investment community 
mainly because he has vowed to use those seats if he wins to 
pressure the company to put his 60ashare 124 billion buyout 
offer before the shareholders 
the victor will not be known for weeks however because it will 
take that long to sort through and tabulate the ballots 
our advisors tell us the likely outcome of the vote is that we 
win said james w kinnear texacos president asked about the 
margin of victory he replied we think it is substantial 
icahn was a little more cautious saying he thought the outcome 
would hang on a block of shares controlled by the new york 
investment firm kohlberg kravis amp roberts co 
kohlberg kravis has not made public how much of its original 12 
millionshare stake it voted or which way 
if it went with us we definitely win icahn said if they 
abstained i believe we win but if it went against us we 
definitely lose 
wall street appeared to be betting on management it sent 
texacos stock 150 lower to close at 48 a share friday on the 
new york stock exchange 
final ballots were cast after icahn and top texaco officials 
made their final pitches during the annual meeting which was held 
in a packed hotel ballroom 
speaking at his own lectern set off to the side the takeover 
specialist criticized texacos management for refusing to let 
shareholders vote on his offer for the texaco shares he does not 
already own 
if were elected what we will do is keep our offer out 
there he said why should you not be allowed to decide simply 
because management does not want to take the risk of losing its 
position its prerogatives 
at 60 a share icahns bid puts a 146 billion value on the 
company adding the 12 billion he paid for his stake to the 124 
billion he is offering for the shares he does not own the 136 
billion total would amount to the largest buyout in corporate 
history 
the crowd estimated at slightly more than 1000 generally 
favored management texaco has many employees in the tulsa area a 
fact that did not go unnoticed by its mayor rodger a randle who 
rose to praise the company during a questionandanswer session 
many shareholders sported buttons featuring the familiar texaco 
star some went one better dressing in various combinations of red 
and white the corporate colors 
another indication of the crowds attitude came early in the 
meeting after icahn protested when texaco chairman alfred c 
decrane jr interrupted him to say he had exceeded his time limit 
for speaking 
a manifestation of the inflexibility that has caused texaco 
its problems icahn sniffed drawing mixed boos and cheers 
kinnear speaking for the companys slate of directors touted 
the spectacular progress it had made over the last 18 months 
during which texaco emerged in april from a year under chapter 11 
bankruptcy protection 
the keystone of its reorganization plan was a 3 billion payment 
to pennzoil co to settle a lawsuit resulting from texacos 1984 
acquisition of getty oil co after pennzoil had made earlier moves 
to acquire getty 
the plan includes sales of 5 billion of marginally profitable 
assets and a 17 billion distribution to shareholders 
our plan is based on the building of value both today and 
for the future kinnear said charging that the icahn groups 
true intention is that they be designated as the brokers for the 
breakup and sale of this companys assets 
several shareholders expressed skepticism about icahns 
intentions even though the offer does propose about 10 more per 
share than texacos stock has been trading for recently 
if you turned the company over to mr icahn it would be 
like giving your stradivarius to a gorilla said bill lenz 
referring to the prized antique violins made by the craftsman of 
the same name 
several texaco distributors and wholesalers also spoke calling 
for support of management while noting that icahns actions had 
harmed their businesses 
some of my dealers are looking for another supplier and 
heating oil accounts are questioning whether ill be able to supply 
heating oil this winter said carlos r leffler a pennsylvania 
distributor 
but it was not all clear sailing for management 
reflecting a palpable current of shareholder unhappiness bill 
collallas a shareholder from cherry hill nj criticized the 
comanys shoddy and incompetent management over the past four 
years 
youre demeaning my intelligence by refusing my right to vote 
on mr icahns proposal and i resent it he told kinnear and 
decrane
