fbi agents seized documents at a plant where 
northrop corp builds parts for the b2 stealth bomber a northrop 
spokesman said thursday 
the spokesman tony cantafio said the company previously has 
turned over thousands of documents in connection with civil 
lawsuits over alleged fraud in the b2 program 
in another blow to the b2 program thursday congress heard a 
recommendation that spending for the radarevading plane should be 
scaled back because of doubts about the planes ability to pass 
critical tests 
the general accounting office the investigative arm of 
congress cautioned that spending cuts shouldnt be imposed until 
after a study to ensure that slowing the program wouldnt result in 
higher costs in the long run 
frank c conahan assistant comptroller general and a member of 
the gao told the house armed services committee that the pentagon 
should work with contractors to find out what the real cost would 
be to delay this and if it isnt an awful lot than i think i 
would concur in that decision to delay this airplane 
cantafio said he didnt know why the agents raided the factory 
in the pico rivera section of los angeles on feb 15 as part of the 
criminal probe rather than subpoena the documents 
they showed up with a search warrant i dont know why they 
wont say they were there cantafio said they came in and took 
some documents on the b2 
he refused to describe the documents and spokesmen for the fbi 
in los angeles and justice department in washington didnt 
immediately return telephone calls 
the los angeles times cited unidentified sources as saying the 
raid provides evidence that a justice department criminal 
investigation into the 70 billion program is escalating after more 
than a year 
several civil and criminal investigations of northrop are under 
way former employees of the century citybased aerospace company 
have filed a whistleblower lawsuit against northrop seeking 20 
billion in damages because of alleged civil fraud in the b2 
program 
the b2 is intended to be difficult to detect on enemy radar 
the effect is achieved through use of fiberglasslike composite 
materials rather than metal as well as a configuration with few 
angles or protruding parts

when prime minister toshiki kaifu toured europe 
last month he demonstrated japans economic might by announcing 
almost 2 billion in aid to poland and hungary dwarfing what the 
united states has committed 
in contrast private japanese industries known for their 
aggressive expansion elsewhere are reluctant to plunge into a part 
of the world they see as inexperienced illequipped and still 
emerging from 40 years of communism 
a few prominent deals have been done suzuki motor co for 
example recently agreed to set up an automobile plant in hungary 
the first japanese company to enter a joint venture with eastern 
europe since the tumultuous political changes there 
but eastern europe remains virtually untouched by japanese 
business in 1988 japan trade with the region totaled about 147 
billion excluding the soviet union thats less than 1 percent of 
japanese trade worldwide 
although many japanese firms have offices in eastern european 
nations only about a dozen joint ventures have been established 
no japanese company has yet invested in poland east germany or 
czechoslovakia 
japanese businessmen have a range of reasons for holding back 
high inflation rates a heavy debt burden and inconvertible 
currencies make it difficult to profit in eastern europe in their 
view 
restrictions on exports of high technology to the east bloc a 
vestige of the cold war that remains entrenched also have reduced 
the spectrum of trade opportunities for the japanese who are 
leading exporters of hightech items 
nonetheless the changing political and economic landscape of 
eastern europe has piqued japans interest the government has 
allocated 750 million for export insurance to encourage japanese 
firms to trade there 
to daihatsu motor co however economic reform and japanese 
government aid cannot alleviate the tremendous risks it sees 
one of japans smallest automobile manufacturers daihatsu has 
tried for more than five years to set up an assembly plant in 
poland although it developed an ambitious plan to build a 
12000vehicleayear plant with polish automaker fso daihatsu 
failed to acquire enough financing and the plan collapsed 
last fall fso approached daihatsu again this time said 
spokesman wataru shindo the company has considerably scaled down 
plans it will export about 6000 unassembled charade models to 
poland 
we dont know whether well be able to meet our costs at a 
scale of 5000 to 6000 cars even if we fail there will be little 
damage done shindo said 
japans largest glass manufacturer expressed the same caution 
asahi glass co has been negotiating with poland to set up a plate 
glass factory in the southern city of sandomierz 
the risks remain high said asahi official shigehiko tomita and 
no commitment has been made 
tomita said trade insurance and other japanese government 
support was necessary but stability in eastern europe was more 
important 
the political and economic situation in poland is still fluid 
and the risks great the country has high inflation and even 
though we think that democratization will proceed we need to have 
some protection he said 
shigeki ura a senior officer with merchant trader c itoh and 
co in eastern europe doubted japanese firms will attempt any 
largescale investments 
nevertheless he added as businessmen specializing in the 
eastern european market we should not be so optimistic but not so 
pessimistic economic reform and democracy will give us chances 
ura said japanese firms differ fundamentally from european firms 
in their attitude toward developing the eastern european market 
the japanese want clearcut laws in place specifying what is 
permissible for foreigners but some european investors are willing 
to overlook legal vaguenesses ura said 
despite japans reluctance its neighbor south korea seems eager 
to exploit opportunity in eastern europe yoo changsoon chairman 
of the federation of korean industries south koreas largest 
business organization said recently that prospects are bright 
for direct investment there 
some big entrepreneurs have already studied plans for direct 
investment in communist countries he said 
south korea established diplomatic relations with hungary 
poland and yugoslavia only last year and has a 91 million trade 
surplus with those countries

the family tarp business about five years ago when his brother 
dennis was shot to death in a dispute over money richard smith 
said

gayla kendrick his livein girlfriend and pennys mother ms 
kendrick a codefendant in smiths drug case also jumped bail and 
is still at large

an 82yearold lawmaker of the ruling 
nationalist party died one day after fainting in the legislature 
building while rioters outside called for him and other elderly 
lawmakers to quit 
chiang kungliang died of a lung malfunction wednesday evening 
at the national taiwan university hospital 
chiang who had been hospitalized for a year with asthma 
fainted tuesday as the legislature convened to vote for a new 
speaker 
a hospital statement did not say if chiangs death was related 
to the rioting outside 
but a doctor for the legislature speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the death may have been partly caused by shock over 
the violent protest 
chiang was among the more than 100 lawmakers who last faced 
election on the chinese mainland more than four decades ago they 
have been frozen in office in support of the nationalist 
governments claim to still be the legitimate ruler of all china 
the protesters demanded that the aging legislators be replaced 
by people elected in taiwan 
in the rioting more than 100 people were injured including 
five elderly politicians who were punched and kicked by the 
demonstrators

a man who embezzled 2 million in us 
department of housing and urban development funds to pay for a 
lavish lifestyle pleaded guilty to reduced charges wednesday after 
helping the government win a cocaine case 
cy walker who spent at least 180000 on cars and also bought a 
speedboat furs and jewelry with some of the stolen hud money 
pleaded guilty to one count of embezzlement and one count of 
failing to file an income tax return for 1986 
us attorney jim wilson said walker faces maximum penalties of 
five years in prison and a 250000 fine on the embezzlement count 
and one year in prison and a 25000 fine on the tax return count 
walker who once held the hud contract to handle closings of hud 
property in the montgomery area is to be sentenced by us 
district judge joel dubina after a presentence report is 
completed no date was set immediately 
after walkers embezzlement scheme was spelled out in hud audits 
and agency documents last year wilson initially declined to say if 
any charges against walker were being considered later it was 
disclosed that walker had arranged a deal with prosecutors to get a 
reduced prosecution in return for undercover work that led to the 
indictment of freddie hyatt on cocaine charges 
hyatt a former auburn university football star and racehorse 
trainer was convicted last september on three cocaine distribution 
counts and was sentenced to four years and three months in federal 
prison his defense attorney contended that walker framed hyatt in 
a series of calls seeking to buy cocaine 
assistant us attorney charles niven who prosecuted hyatt at 
the trial in opelika defended the plea agreement made with walker 
saying that to catch a drug dealer you use people who are 
involved in criminal activities you dont sell drugs to preachers 
or sunday school teachers 
it was brought out at the trial that walker would be allowed to 
plead guilty to the two counts 
walker used a banks wire transfer forms to embezzle the hud 
money during a period of more than two years before hud discovered 
the scheme in 1987 by the time hud officials sought to get the 
money walker had depleted the bank account 
walker acknowledged from the witness stand at the hyatt trial 
that he had used the money to buy sports cars and entertain women 
walker pleaded guilty to one count of embezzling 2073499 in 
hud funds and a second count of failing to pay federal taxes on 
711821 for the 1986 tax year

nelson mandelas release may 
lead to talks between blacks and whites on south africas future 
but many business leaders doubt his economic theories would make 
for sound management of the continents strongest economy 
mandela the african national congress leader released feb 11 
after 27 years in prison favors state control of the countrys 
gold mines banks and monopoly industries to help redistribute the 
wealth that is disproportionately controlled by whites 
many economists and business executives say attempts to 
nationalize south africas economy will result in the stagnation 
that has plagued eastern europe and africas socialistoriented 
economies 
the anc remains locked in the past its economics 35 years 
out of date said business day a financial daily opposed to 
apartheid 
raymond parsons head of the south african chamber of business 
says if south africa is to survive in the modern global economy 
and if we are to serve the total population best we are going to 
have to expand the private enterprise ethic 
mandela and most other senior anc leaders are in their 60s or 
70s and were imprisoned or fled into exile in the early 1960s when 
scientific socialism was the favored economic system among 
africas newly independent states 
such systems have failed miserably no more than five black 
african nations have per capita incomes in excess of 1000 a year 
and none of those are socialist oriented 
yet the anc contends some degree of socialism is needed to help 
reduce the enormous gap between white wealth and black poverty 
the nationalization of mines is a fundamental policy of the 
anc mandela said after his release i believe the anc is quite 
correct in this attitude 
such talk sent the johannesburg stock exchange falling mandela 
has since sought to reassure white businessmen by saying the anc 
would consult business leaders before making any major economic 
changes and would expect both sides to compromise 
the anc is the main black group fighting the whiteminority 
government and most observers believe it would win elections if 
blacks were allowed to vote 
the organization was legalized feb 2 and plans to send a 
delegation from its headquarters in zambia to meet president fw 
de klerk and try to clear the way for talks on a new constitution 
that will include the countrys 28 million blacks 
south africa is the worlds largest gold producer and a handful 
of mining conglomerates dominate the economy 
many blacks see apartheid and capitalism as intertwined and 
feel both need to be eradicated many antiapartheid groups 
including the largest black labor federation the congress of south 
african trade unions are avowedly socialist 
south africa seems to be one of the last places on earth where 
the display of the hammer and sickle at public rallies still evokes 
cheers herman nickel a former us ambassador to south africa 
wrote recently in the wall street journal 
per capita income for south african blacks is about 1000 a 
year but whites make at least five times more on average 
economic opportunity was virtually nonexistent for blacks until 
recent years whites controlled private companies and dominated 
managerial posts in the large staterun industries such as steel 
transport and energy 
the government recently has begun to sell off huge state 
operations saying they will be more efficient as private 
companies but some blacks including mandela argue the moves are 
designed to keep wealth in white hands now that there is talk about 
the possibility of a black government 
blacks are now making some economic progress their incomes are 
rising faster than those of whites and blackrun businesses range 
from large construction firms to taxi fleets 
sam motsuenyane president of the black national african chamber 
of commerce has earned the respect of many antiapartheid leaders 
with his calls for black empowerment through economic success 
black enterprise magazine which features examples of thriving 
blackowned businesses and offers advice to aspiring entrepreneurs 
has done well since its launch several years ago 
the antiapartheid city press the countrys largest 
blackoriented newspaper said in a recent editorial that anc 
leaders have to seriously review their stand on nationalization 
while we agree there has to be some form of redistribution of 
wealth beacuse the majority of the people in this country were 
disadvantaged by the system of apartheid we tend to agree with 
motsuenyanes assertion about black economic empowerment the 
newspaper said

for the second time crazy eddie founder 
eddie antar is wanted by federal marshals in connection with an 
order to turn over 52 million in overseas funds officials said 
wednesday 
the arrest warrant was issued by us magistrate ronald j 
hedges after the reclusive founder of the consumerelectronics 
store chain failed to appear at a court hearing tuesday 
hes a wanted fugitive we have a lot of addresses but we 
dont know where he is said us marshal arthur borinsky 
antar who is under investigation by the us securities and 
exchange commission had been ordered by us district judge 
nicholas politan to turn over 52 million the sec alleges was 
obtained in insider trading 
the sec has been pursuing a civil securities fraud case against 
antar and three other former officers of the 43store empire which 
collapsed last year 
on feb 9 politan issued an arrest warrant on civil contempt 
charges after antar failed to show up at a hearing to explain why 
he did not obey the order to return the money 
antar appealed politans order to the 3rd us circuit court of 
appeals and surrendered voluntarily on feb 13 to the us marshal 
in newark 
his attorney jack arseneault has argued that to return the 
money would be selfincriminating because it would be tantamount to 
an admission that the money is there politan has rejected that 
argument 
last friday the appellate court in philadelphia also struck 
down the argument clearing the way for civil contempt proceedings 
if antar fails to turn over the money 
hedges issued the arrest warrant after antars lawyers explained 
that their client was unavailable court officials said antars 
lawyers did not immediately return telephone calls to their office

federal financial help or special mine insurance

24footwide and 4footdeep sinkhole developed under cannelburgs 
main street it was later repaired 
but sinkholes and depressions have since materialized at an 
alarming rate mine and safety authorities believe miles of 
abandoned slowly deteriorating mines underneath the city are 
causing the depressions the indiana department of natural 
resources wants to conduct extensive tests to determine the exact 
cause of structural damage 
sue beckett said her home has nearly twisted on its foundation 
at first she said we noticed minor things we had a door

third movie in his series about a philadelphia club fighter who

economic sanctions have 
retarded growth costing jobs and affecting social programs but 
whether they have pushed the government to political reform is a 
matter of argument 
we believe sanctions have been very helpful nelson mandela 
said after president fw de klerk freed the african national 
congress leader from a life prison term feb 11 
mandela also credited mass struggles inside south africa and 
changes in the thinking of government leaders for his release and 
the legalization of the anc and other organizations 
government officials and white businessmen acknowledge the 
economy has been affected by withdrawal of investments trade 
embargoes and punitive loan terms but say political changes are 
being made simply because its the right thing to do 
finance minister barend du plessis stands by the government line 
that sanctions did not influence reform although they cost the 
country wealth and jobs he said this week the reforms de klerk has 
made may ease the sanctions 
that already has happened in britains case on wednesday prime 
minister margaret thatcher lifted a ban on investments and urged 
the european economic community to end other punishments as an 
encouragement to de klerk 
kent durr the south african trade minister said the british 
action would encourage negotiations on an end to apartheid 
when de klerk returned from meetings with mrs thatcher and 
other european leaders in june he said international pressure and 
economic sanctions may ease as long as it is visible that were 
really working to end apartheid and white domination of the 
government 
he has since ended segregation of beaches allowed huge 
antigovernment demonstrations legalized 60 organizations freed 
some political prisoners suspended all executions and partially 
lifted the state of emergency 
de klerk never said he was caving in to foreign pressure as 
rightwing opponents claim but he has clearly linked south 
africas internal economic and political problems with its 
international image 
the time has come for south africa to restore its pride and to 
lift itself out of the doldrums of growing international isolation 
economic decline and increasing polarization he said at his 
inauguration in september 
we are going to open the door to prosperity and economic 
growth by breaking out of the international stranglehold which 
for political reasons has been applied to our growth potential 
nico czypionka chief economist of the standard bank said 
sanctions did certainly undercut economic growth but i dont 
think that was the factor that triggered the political changes 
taking place 
he said the black population boom and urbanization of hundreds 
of thousands of rural blacks probably contributed to the 
goverments movement toward reform 
financial experts agree the most damaging sanctions were those 
by lenders in 1985 creditor banks decided not to renew loans and 
to impose strict credit policies 
economists at the trust bank estimate south africa would have 
had 14 billion more in loans and investment in the past five years 
and 4 billion more in export earnings had it not been for 
sanctions and political turmoil 
sanctions also forced businesses to increase efficiency showed 
consumers they could do without many imported luxuries and caused 
the government to change its financial policy 
most of the nearly 200 foreign companies that left south africa 
sold their local operations to domestic owners for low prices to be 
paid over long terms few jobs were lost but many social 
educational housing and training programs begun by foreigners were 
dropped

a sculptor told lawmakers he would never 
have entered a competition to design a major state statue if he 
knew they were going put it on the ground instead of on top of the 
statehouse dome 
the proposed 20foot statue named ad astra from the states 
motto ad astra per aspera or to the stars through 
difficulty was designed by richard bergen of salina it depicts 
a male kansa indian pointing a bow and arrow toward the sky 
after years of debate about a plan to put a statue of ceres the 
goddess of agriculture and fertility atop the capitol dome the 
1984 legislature authorized the kansas arts commission to conduct a 
competition and choose an alternative statue 
bergens design was named the winner in 1988 and he was awarded 
a 1500 prize plus the promise of a contract to produce the 
fullsized work for 50000 he told the house economic development 
committee on tuesday he could have it done in one year 
however the project ran into a major problem an assessment of 
the domes structural condition produced an estimate that it could 
cost as much as 400000 to shore it up so it could hold the 
twoton statue 
the 1989 legislature declined to appropriate the money 
a bill introduced this year would place ad astra on a pedestal 
base on the statehouse grounds rather than on the dome at a cost 
of only 25000 
bergen strenuously objected 
i designed this originally to go up on the dome he told 
lawmakers tuesday i dont want it on the ground if they had 
said they wanted it on the ground i wouldnt have been in the 
competition 
thats not the way kansans work we complete our tasks he 
said if i have to go out and raise the money to put it up there 
ill do it 
bergen argued the dome is sound enough to hold his statue if the 
state would just perform normal maintenance and spend a nominal 
amount to shore it up 
he also said the 400000 estimated cost is inflated because it 
contains 100000 in contingency fees in case costs wind up higher 
than expected he said he can get a helicopter on loan to do hoist 
work eliminating a 78000 expense 
i think we ought to go ahead and put the thing up there he 
told the committee 
lucinda foster chairwoman of the arts commission said the 
statue is shaped to be viewed from 300 feet away and putting it on 
the ground would detract from its esthetic value 
this proposal unfortunately raises more problems than it 
solves unless it is a temporary plan mrs foster said

although the family had some tax problems that most americans 
will never face some of the experts fumbled such basic items as 
the credit for child care expenses the deduction for moving 
expenses and the social security tax owed by a selfemployed person 
the 35 certified public accountants eight independent enrolled 
agents two noncpas and five preparers from such chains as hampr 
block charged fees ranging from 271 to 4000 
there was no logical connection between fees charged and 
performance of the two preparers who fared best one charged 
about 275 above average the other around 260 below the 
magazine said over the past three years the average preparation 
fee for an upperincome return has risen by 30 percent to 1012 
this year 
while the pros are still having their problems with the 1986 tax 
overhaul money found the people who answer questions by phone 
at the internal revenue service are doing a little better this 
year irs personnel correctly answered the magazines questions 72 
percent of the time compared with 59 percent a year ago 
should the news about the tax experts scare you into preparing 
your own return as only about onehalf of taxpayers still do 
the magazine offers this advice if our insanely complicated 
tax code can trip up even highly trained cpas what hope would a 
mere layman have unless his return was relatively simple or he was 
an avid amateur accountant willing to put in long hours of study 
this is the third straight year that money has handed tax 
professionals the records of a hypothetical family and asked them 
to calculate what the family owes under the new tax law 
the first year no two preparers computed the same tax due and 
their answers ranged from 7202 to 11881 the second year the 
range was from 12539 to 35812 only 10 experts managed to avoid 
significant errors 
this years results were even more depressing our test 
stumped all but two of the 50 tax pros who were willing to grapple 
with it the magazine reports in its march issue 
this years test involved john and jane who had two preschool 
children and income of 132000 their finances put them in the top 
2 percent of earners and although some of their tax problems will 
never be encountered by most americans they should not pose a 
major problem for professional tax preparers 
in addition to several errors on the child care credit and 
selfemployment tax money said other major mistakes involved 
calculation of taxes on mutual fund shares tax consequences of 
janes 8000 loss on worthless stock the handling of the couples 
retirement accounts and treatment of moving expenses 
in testing the irs personnel who take tax questions by phone 
money found the answers were correct 90 percent of the time if 
they were to be found in the form 1040 instruction booklet or in 
basic irs information publications but if the questiontakers had 
to dig the magazine said they tended toward misleading advice 
money said taxpayers who have to use professional preparers 
should invest in a commercial tax guide so they can take as much 
knowledge as possible to their tax lawyer or accountant 
the magazines closing advice has been echoed in the past by the 
irs keep asking your preparer questions about any items on your 
return that you dont understand the more questions you ask the 
more youll force your pro to think again about the issues and 
maybe even spot an error that might otherwise bring down the wrath 
of the revenuers 
none of the nations six largest accounting firms would 
calculate the taxes for the hypothetical family the magazine 
quotes a spokesman for the arthur andersen firm as saying his 
firm had a lot to lose by performing poorly and little to gain by 
doing well

the army says some career officers may be 
forced out as the service shrinks in the next few years to adapt to 
a fading soviet military threat 
the services top military and civilian officials told congress 
on wednesday that career officers would be eliminated only as a 
last resort but such cuts may be needed as part of a reduction in 
overall us military strength 
the army will not dismiss them lightly and break faith said 
an army posture statement presented to the house appropriations 
defense subcommittee by army secretary michael pw stone and gen 
carl e vuono the army chief of staff 
the report said the army would continue to try to keep 
highquality soldiers and military leaders even as defense spending 
declines and troop levels are cut 
we must continue to attract and retain the best educated 
motivated and ambitious young men and women our nation has to 
offer stone told the subcommittee 
the subcommittee hearing was closed to the public copies of the 
army report and the prepared testimony of stone and vuono were 
released at the pentagon 
the report gave no estimate of how many of the 375000 career 
army officers and noncommissioned officers might be dismissed 
such reductions would be highly unusual for the us military 
which following world war ii the korean war and vietnam was able 
to slim its ranks by turning loose thousands of draftees eager to 
reenter the civilian economy todays soldiers and officers 
however are all volunteers and for many the service is a career 
in a joint introductory passage in the army report stone and 
vuono said movements away from totalitarian rule in the soviet 
union and eastern europe had opened the way to what may be a 
significant reduction in the possibility of war between major 
industrialized nations 
but they added soviet and sovietsupported military action in 
europe and asia will remain a demanding challenge for the us 
military requiring that the army remain ready for highintensity 
warfare even as it shrinks in size 
the army is planning to trim its ranks by more than 100000 over 
the next few years to a total of about 770000 
the report also spelled out the changing nature of the armys 
mission it said that although the army would try to remain 
prepared for a largescale highintensity war on the european 
continent it would put increasing emphasis on the risk of 
lowintensity conflicts such as third world skirmishes and strikes 
at terrorists 
clearly lowintensity conflict is the security challenge most 
likely to demand a us military response in the future the 
report said adding that more than 800 soldiers currently are 
involved in counternarcotics missions 
the report said army forces have been providing training and 
support to antinarcotics units in latin america for some 
time it cited bolivia and colombia as examples no other details 
were provided 
involvement in the national campaign against illegal drugs is 
consistent with the armys role as a strategic force fulfilling 
the overall mission of safeguarding the national security of the 
united states both at home and abroad it said

the government is promising special 
measures to protect americans threatened with death by a leftist 
guerrilla group and us nationals are hiring extra security 
guards 
americans on the us embassy staff were told wednesday to stay 
home except for necessary trips and were being escorted to and from 
work by armed guards an embassy employee said 
a us oil executive said his company had canceled all trips 
outside bogota by american employees 
every american client ive got was on the telephone this 
morning asking for more guards the owner of a security company 
that protects several us companies told the associated press 
the national liberation army declared tuesday that all us 
interests in colombia were its military targets 
it has kidnapped three americans in a week james donnelly of 
detroit and david kent of indianapolis still were beomg held but 
the guerrillas freed the rev francis amico ferarri of rochester 
ny a roman catholic priest 
minister of government carlos lemos a member of the national 
security council said after a council meeting tuesday night that 
the government was making special arrangements to protect americans 
and us business interests 
he said it appeared recent attacks by the guerrillas also were 
meant to discourage people from voting in congressional and mayoral 
elections march 11 the national liberation army has become the 
most antiamerican and violent of colombias six guerrilla groups 
manuel perez a former catholic priest commands the procuba 
guerrilla group 
two years ago his guerrillas began blowing up sections of 
colombias largest oil pipeline an average of almost once a week 
the line which carries 240000 barrels of crude a day from 
northeastern cano limon field 500 miles to the caribbean coast has 
been attacked twice this week and seven times in 1990 
ecopetrol the state oil company said the pipeline had been 
shut down since monday because of the damage a spokesman who 
insisted on anonymity for fear of becoming a guerrilla target said 
it should reopen in a few days 
the guerrillas have made their threat against americans three 
times first in a letter addressed to the families of kent and 
donnelly it was published by the daily el colombiano of medellin 
headquarters of the most powerful cocaine cartel where the men 
were kidnapped feb 13 
amico told the bogota daily el tiempo that he carried another 
copy of the threat when he was released in the form of a statement 
from the national liberation army 
on wednesday the spanish news agency efe said it had received a 
threatening guerrilla statement that singled out thomas mcnamara 
the us ambassador 
no firm figures are available on the number of americans in 
colombia but past us embassy estimates have been about 20000 
the state department already had considered colombia so 
dangerous it would send only people who were single or married and 
willing to live apart from their families diplomats get hazard pay 
for service in colombia 
us oil companies operating in the country include occidental 
exxon texaco houston oil amoco and chevron among the dozens of 
other us firms are ibm xerox general motors colgatepalmolive 
borden johnson amp johnson squibb and kodak 
the most serious attack on a us company by the guerrilla group 
occurred two years ago when a car bomb exploded outside occidental 
headquarters in bogota wounding two guards and breaking most 
windows in the 10story building

an organizer hopes to lead the first 
announced delegation of chinese students to return home since the 
killing of scores of people in tiananmen square 
i believe that this is the right cause we have to open the 
door to interaction without interaction we can do nothing with the 
movement back home said matthew huang the leader of the 
proposed delegation by the independent federation of chinese 
students and scholars in the united states 
the federation recently voted to seek permission for a visiting 
delegation 
letters have been sent to the chinese embassy in washington 
dc but there has been no response so far huang a student at 
the university of massachusetts said its possible the government 
will refuse to allow the students to return 
we do want to go back and we think someone should take the 
risk said shen tong one of the leaders in the prodemocracy 
movement in beijing who eluded capture and is now studying at 
brandeis university in waltham mass 
he said wednesday he was willing to take that risk 
this kind of open attitude can basically challenge the chinese 
governments closeddoor policy he said its also for the 
american government we want to show the bush administration we 
didnt give up our struggle 
the administration asserting that it is important to maintain a 
dialogue with china to encourage liberalization last month vetoed 
a bill protecting chinese students against deportation bush has 
twice sent highlevel emissaries to china since last summers 
bloody suppression 
a statement by the student federation said reasons for its visit 
include investigating what happened to those killed when soldiers 
moved into beijings tiananmen square on june 4 as well as seeing 
the real china normal or not 
huang a 27yearold biology student said hes scared about 
what may happen on a trip home 
we will try our best to go back and maybe we will face some 
danger huang said one thing is for certain is we wont trade 
our principles 
officials at the chinese embassy in washington did not return a 
telephone call on wednesday 
the crackdown of the prodemocracy movement was followed by an 
outcry by chinese students studying in the united states many were 
colleagues of the students leading the movement in china

lifelong republican karl hilli says 
sending best wishes to a democrat he respects may have cost him a 
spot in the town delegation 
the state republican party stripped hilli of his membership in 
the delegation after learning he wrote to newspaper editors 
extending his best wishes to state representative candidate 
william king a democrat 
the times are too tough to be too narrowminded hilli said 
i cant just hammer somebody because he has a d next to his 
name 
hilli worked last year to revive the town republican committee 
and was chairman of the local gop delegation he said he hopes to 
clear up the situation so he can still serve as a delegate at the 
state party convention in boston next month 
alexander tennant executive director of the republican state 
committee wrote hilli that party rules clearly state endorsing 
anyone other than a republican in a partisan election equals 
automatic resignation 
i think hes a nice guy hilli said of king in an interview 
tuesday because i say good luck to someone doesnt mean i 
support him i think hed be a good candidate but it does not mean 
im endorsing him over a republican that might run

colder weather in the great plains winter 
wheat area after two months of relatively balmy temperatures is 
reminding farmers that it is still february after all 
winter returned to the northern and central plains as arctic 
air plunged south and reversed the warm spell of the last two 
months the governments joint agricultural weather facility said 
wednesday 
rain benefited winter wheat in portions of the central and 
southern great plains in the week of feb 1117 the report 
said although additional moisture was needed in kansas 
the facility is operated by the departments of agriculture and 
commerce the weekly reports cover weather and crop conditions but 
do not include crop production forecasts 
also the period covered did not include more recent 
precipitation in the plains area including up to a foot of snow in 
the oklahoma panhandle and parts of western kansas 
in a related report the usda said wheat inventories may drop to 
443 million bushels by the beginning of the next marketing year on 
june 1 the lowest in 15 years and down from 702 million bushels a 
year ago 
however increases in planted area and a return to normal 
yields in 1990 will likely allow modest stock rebuilding if use is 
similar to the previous two years the departments economic 
research service said 
the us area planted to winter wheat last fall is up 3 percent 
even though an additional 19 million acres of wheat base were 
enrolled in the conservation reserve program during 1989 
while the winter wheat crop in the southern plains was 
stressed by dryness in the fall and early winter precipitation and 
relatively mild temperatures in january and february have raised 
crop prospects the report said nonetheless timely rains will 
be needed in coming months 
looking at the global situation the report said wheat export 
prices in recent weeks have declined to below yearearlier levels 
rising foreign stocks relatively slow sales in the first half 
of the 198990 marketing year a largerthananticipated southern 
hemisphere harvest and prospects for a large 199091 northern 
hemisphere crop have translated into the declining export prices 
the report said 
overall global wheat production in 198990 is up about 7 
percent from a year earlier but consumption will exceed production 
for the third straight year that will drain world wheat stockpiles 
to their lowest level since 198182 
but all of the decline in global wheat inventories will be in 
the united states the report said stocks held by foreign exporters 
are up 12 percent from the 198989 marketing year

scientists conducting genetic experiments with 
ordinary pond scum say it may one day be an automatic dispenser of 
fertilizer in rice fields 
but the scientists who work for the agricultural research 
service in the agriculture department said wednesday it may be 
another 15 years before rice growers are able to use the pond scum 
or bluegreen algae as a fertilizer source 
if the procedure can be developed the natural fertilizer 
dispensed by the special algae could have a significant effect on 
rice production around the world including many third world 
countries that rely on the crop as a food staple 
stephen albrecht a plant physiologist at the agencys 
laboratory in gainesville fla said greenhouse tests with the 
altered algae boosted rice production eightfold however he said 
it didnt do well in the field probably because the algae had not 
been adapted to field conditions 
normally pond algae produces just enough nutrientrich ammonia 
from nitrogen in the atmosphere to take care of its own needs the 
genetically engineered strains keep producing as long as nearby 
plants need the nutrients 
when rice plants stop taking in ammonia the algae stops 
production before excess amounts spill over into the environment 
albrecht said the onandoff fertilizing system could mean less 
groundwater contamination tests showed that while rice with algae 
at its roots had some ammonia there was none in the environment 
if the algae can be adapted to rice fields albrecht said 
growers could grow algae alongside rice fields and flood it into 
the rice areas at irrigation time he said it would be cheaper and 
require less work than with commercial fertilizers

in the summer of 1975 gerald ford was in the 
white house and leonid brezhnev was in the kremlin toni tennille 
cooed love will keep us together and a chorus line opened 
on broadway 
but no show runs forever 
producer joseph papp announced wednesday that the musical 
celebration of broadway dancers probably will close march 31 after 
its 6104th performance the longest run in broadway history 
when a chorus line moved to the shubert theater from 
offbroadway on july 25 1975 broadway was coming off its worst 
musical season in years there had been a series of expensive flops 
like mack and mabel goodtime charley doctor jazz and 
a revival of good news the only crowdpleasers were pleasant 
if undistinguished musicals like shenandoah and the wiz 
a chorus line changed all that it quickly became the 
hottest ticket in town now some of its original performers still 
want it to stay around 
what i had always hoped would happen it would go back 
offbroadway and go on forever like the fantasticks said kelly 
bishop sheila in the original production during a news 
conference maybe that could happen 
papp producer of the new york shakespeare festival where 
michael bennett and some cohorts first opened it to the public on 
april 15 1975 discounted the possibility 
why go back he said were a symbol of broadway and 
should stay there in symbol as well as fact 
bob avian who choreographed the show with bennett predicted 
that a chorus line will be revived on broadway in five to 10 
years 
itll be on the road forever and we can all feel a part of 
that you know classics never die he said 
the musical performed on a nearly bare stage without 
intermission tells the stories of 18 dancers auditioning for a big 
broadway musical they are put through their paces by an unseen 
director who questions them about why they want to dance 
among the hopefuls are cassie a featured dancer once linked 
romantically to the director and now trying to get back into the 
chorus sheila an insecure wisecracking older dancer who 
discovered as a child everything was beautiful at the ballet 
and diana who explains her passion for dance in what became the 
shows best known song what i did for love 
papp said that a chorus line has had weeks when it lost 
money but so far this year it has steadily incurred losses he 
said that weekly operating costs are 160000 and since jan 1 
average weekly income has been 122825 
he hopes that people will rush to see a chorus line before 
march 31 if boxoffice lines are long enough he said a chorus 
line might run through easter week if ticket sales dont pick 
up the show will close before march 31 
on sept 19 1983 when the musical logged its 3389th 
performance it became the longestrunning show in broadway 
history overtaking grease 
the second longestrunning broadway show was the revival of 
oh calcutta which closed sept 24 after 5959 performances 
it is followed by 42nd street 3486 grease 3388 and 
fiddler on the roof 3242

attempts to reform deposit insurance could do 
more harm than good to the nations financial system says a top 
regulator who warns that many proposals circulating would cause 
negative side effects 
injecting more market discipline into the banking system 
although desirable would involve tradeoffs that include greater 
financial instability and less protection for consumers said l 
william seidman chairman of the federal deposit insurance corp 
this is a dangerous subject he said wednesday dont grab 
for easy quick solutions or youre liable to blow yourself out of 
the water 
the house banking committee hearing which also featured general 
accounting office head charles a bowsher opened what promises to 
be the most explosive financial industry issue before congress in 
the next few years 
many private analysts believe deposit insurance helped encourage 
the risky behavior that led to mammoth sampl losses depositors have 
little or no reason to care whether they were placing their money 
in a sound institution they argue 
congress considered the question too hot to handle in last 
years sampl bill and ordered the treasury department and bowshers 
agency congress auditing and investigative arm to study the 
mattter and make recommendations by next february 
bowsher gave little hint of the gaos ultimate stance but urged 
legislators not to lose sight of the benefits of the system 
deposit insurance deserves much of the credit for the fact 
that there was no serious loss of confidence in the banking 
system during the 1970s and 1980s when the nation experienced 
oil shocks inflation the worst recession since the great 
depression and a stock market crash he said 
on other matters seidman 
said the fdic was investigating whether it had the authority to 
curb socalled golden parachute contracts that provide bank and 
sampl executives with lucrative severance benefits if their 
institution fails perversely sometimes executives benefit more 
from an institutions failure than its success he said 
issued a new more pessimistic assessment of the commercial bank 
insurance funds condition the fund which lost 4 billion in 1988 
and declined again in 1989 likely will about break even in 
1990 he said ending the year around 14 billion 
the reason is weve developed some real problems in real 
estate in the northeast and down the east coast and we dont know 
how much if anything thats going to cost us he said 
he said at this time the agency does not expect any major 
bank failures among institutions currently reporting increased 
losses 
both bowsher and seidman conceded the failure of hundreds of 
banks and sampls in recent years make it clear the governments 
exposure to loss must be limited 
however seidman warned depositors must experience real 
losses to develop real market discipline he added no one 
really knows what would happen if a large bank were allowed to 
default on deposit obligations 
so far regulators have been unwilling to risk the chance that a 
failure of a big bank would bring down the entire financial system 
he said one of the most common reform proposals reducing the 
100000 insurance limit would probably be ineffective most 
depositors would simply divide their money into smaller chunks and 
spread it among more institutions 
a rule limiting depositors to just one insured account among all 
banks and sampls would be difficult to administer he said 
nevertheless reps henry b gonzalez dtexas the chairman of 
the committee said congress must consider reducing the 100000 
deposit insurance limit arguing it is too broad and has gotten 
away from its original purpose protection of the small 
depositor but he said legislation was unlikely until next year 
after completion of the gao and treasury studies 
both gonzalez and rep chalmers wylie of ohio the panels 
senior republican said expansion of bank investment powers long 
sought by the industry will not be considered separately from 
deposit insurance reform

divers pulled five bodies out of 
frigid convict lake wednesday but officials said the effort to 
recover the last of seven people who fell through thin ice would be 
suspended indefinitely 
search efforts have been suspended tomorrow due to loss of 
resources and safety factors mono county sheriff martin a 
strelneck said late wednesday the divers are getting tired and 
cold and its getting dangerous out there for them 
rescue divers planned to rest and regroup before resuming the 
search for the body of dave meyers 53 of bishop strelneck said

a new map unveiled by the agriculture 
department today shows detailed temperature zones across the nation 
to aid home gardeners and nursery operators 
the new plant hardiness zone map updated for the first time in 
25 years shows detailed markings and information for all 50 
states including alaska and hawaii for the first time 
also for the first time small areas of microclimates are 
indicated said h marc cathey director of the departments 
national arboretum who oversaw revision of the map 
these are cool pockets caused by mountaintop elevations and hot 
spots in cities or protected valleys he said for example the map 
shows tiny microclimates scattered throughout the rocky mountain 
area and the northeast 
although less concentrated the microclimates also are shown in 
the great plains corn belt and other regions of the country some 
of them cover parts of several counties while others are confined 
to small portions of single counties 
commercial nurseries use the average minimum temperatures 
designated by the maps zones to determine when plants should be 
shipped to different parts of the country 
plant varieties are often catalogued by the zones in which they 
will survive and thrive 
cathey said the map also includes canada and mexico 
our borders are contiguous and we share many plants both 
native and introduced he said in a statement issued by the 
departments agricultural research service it is appropriate not 
to isolate the us when talking about climate 
the map unfolds to four feet by four feet and has 11 colorcoded 
zones based on 10degree fahrenheit differences in average annual 
minimum temperatures each zone is divided into a and b regions 
based on 5degree differences 
zone 11 is new representing an almost frostfree zone on the 
southern tip of florida southern california all but the 
mountainous areas of hawaii most of the coastline of the yucatan 
in mexico the southern baja peninsula and the gulf of mexico 
information from 14500 weather stations went into the project 
more than twice as many stations used for maps produced in 1960 and 
1965 
cathey said there are no signs that might represent global 
warming but on both coasts particularly in the southeast 
temperatures are 5 to 10 degrees cooler in the winter than 
indicated on the previous map 
the new information used to create the map allowed the borders 
of the zones to be drawn in much more detail than before and are 
more precise with intricate edges where the zones interweave 
cathey said the new map should eliminate some of the 
inconsistencies between gardeners experiences with local weather 
and the previous map 
meteorologist mark kramer of meteorological evaluation services 
amityville ny a private firm which analyzed the data for the 
department said the new map tells us the weather has changed 
but we dont know whether the climate is changing weather he 
said is daytoday monthtomonth and yeartoyear while climate 
represents a longer term starting with about 30 years 
copies of the map are available for 650 each from the 
government printing office miscellaneous publication 1475 stock 
number 0010000455004 the agency said the washington phone 
number is 202 7833238

faulty brakes that consumers blame for more 
than 100 accidents may lead to a recall of some general motors 
cars although the company is resisting the government says 
the national highway traffic safety administration said 
wednesday that gm rejected the agencys request to issue a 
voluntary recall the agency said it was opening a formal safety 
defect investigation to prepare for a possible governmentordered 
recall 
the probe covers 175000 chevrolet camaros and pontiac firebirds 
from the 1982 through 1986 model years it also covers 273000 
pontiac fieros from the 1984 through 1986 model years 
rear disc brakes on many of the vehicles do not adjust 
automatically as the brake pads wear the agency said in a 
statement 
as a result the rear brakes may become less effective in 
stopping a moving car and the parking brake may be unable to hold 
a parked car on a slope it said there are no warning signs of 
the parking brake problem 
the brake warning light might be activated depending on the 
extent of brake pad wear and how hard the driver presses the pedal 
but it sometimes illuminates only during emergency stops when the 
driver is exerting full force on the brake the statement said 
a vehicle typically develops the problem after about 18600 
miles on the road 
the agency said it received 42 complaints from owners including 
14 reported crashes and five injuries general motors has reported 
129 accidents 13 injuries and two deaths that owners blame on the 
brake problem 
we will continue to cooperate with the agency gm spokesman 
tom pyden said the investigation will offer both parties the 
opportunity to exchange and review additional technical data on 
this subject from there we can work together toward a resolution 
of this matter

viewers in 12 cities watched as doctors 
reconstructed a 15monthold girls skull on live television but 
the infants parents chose to watch the wizard of oz instead 
surgeons successfully reshaped the infants skull tuesday night 
to correct a rare disorder plagiocephaly which causes the seams 
in the skull to close prematurely the result is facial deformity 
and the threat of serious vision problems 
the patient michele miller daughter of lynn and paul miller of 
the princeton nj area was born with the condition 
micheles parents sat out the twohour procedure in a hospital 
waiting room watching the classic movie starring judy garland as a 
young girl who dreams of visiting the mythical land of oz 
the operation was televized live by whyy in philadelphia and 
carried by 11 other public television stations including wqed in 
pittsburgh wgbx in boston and kera in dallas fifteen other 
stations taped the program for later broadcast 
whyys first live broadcast of an operation spinal surgery 
conducted june 19 gave the station at that time its highest 
ratings ever for a local production and prompted whyy to plan 
tuesdays program 
we felt this one had an educational mission said whyy 
director mike quattrone this is something that can be corrected 
what we want to do is demystify something take away the 
fears 
at the end of the program viewers were invited to call the 
philadelphia television station with their comments tina brock of 
whyy said at least 100 calls came in within the first 25 minutes 
one man said this is the most amazing thing ive ever seen on 
television according to brock 
a boy called long distance from new york to say the program was 
awesome brock said 
some callers said at first they found the operation difficult to 
watch but were drawn into the medical procedures by the surgeons 
clear explanations 
it went really well plastic surgeon linton a whitaker 
said there were no great problems although the child was a 
little older than the ideal of six to nine months it still works 
very well up to about 18 months but the bones a little thicker a 
little harder to cut 
during the operation the surgeons reshaped micheles skull and 
reconstructed the area around her left eye 
she might have been ok as far as vision but the side of the 
head was definitely abnormal whitaker said her parents 
recognized it at birth 
prior to the surgery the left side of her face was slightly 
flattened 
micheles parents agreed to allow the operation to be televised 
in hopes of reaching others who have children with plagiocephaly 
and may not realize it or know that corrective surgery is available 
maybe you think something is wrong but you dont say 
anything lynn miller said had i known that surgery was an 
option i would have taken her sooner 
whitaker said michele should be discharged from the hospital 
within a week the only scar will be on top of her head 
public televisions stations that plan to show the program at a 
later date are wlvt in allentown pa kqec in san francisco ktca 
in st paul minn wcfe in plattsburgh ny south dakota public 
television knpb in reno nev wmvt in milwaukee knme in 
albuquerque nm wgvu in grand rapids mich wskg in binghamton

an oblong object that officials last 
year proclaimed to be a fossilized egg up to 16 million years old 
has turned out to be a stomach stone from a modern mammal possibly 
a cow 
mother nature fooled us said mike oneill a us bureau of 
land management fossil expert 
oneill said he concluded after two months of study that the 
surface of the eggshaped object was made up of calcium phosphate 
rather than the calcium carbonate it should have contained had it 
been an ancient fossil 
denver paleontologist karl hirsch when consulted suggested the 
object might be a stomach stone oneill said 
he told me about some papers that had been written on those 
so i went to the library and did research and it matched up 
oneill said 
stomach stones are formed in ruminants such as cattle deer or 
goats when foreign objects enter their digestive tracts oneill 
said the object becomes chemically coated 
the stone found by a forest service wildlife specialists last 
fall in carson national forest probably had been on the ground for 
three to five years oneill said

president daniel ortega rejected 
communism and capitalism and asked god for wisdom to govern in 
a rousing speech before 300000 people that closed the sandinista 
partys election campaign 
he told the crowd that he expects a sandinista victory over the 
usbacked opposition coalition in sundays elections to finally 
bring respectful relations with the united states after a 
decade of contempt 
members of the wildly cheering crowd waved waving blackandred 
sandinista flags and chanting daniel daniel 
behind ortega on a terraced reviewing stand on the shores of 
lake managua were other leaders of the leftist sandinistas 
international election observers journalists and bianca jagger 
exwife of rock star mick jagger 
wednesdays rally was the second largest in nicaraguan history 
surpassed only by one during pope john paul iis 1983 visit 
streams of people flowed through town dancing to rock reggae and 
brass bands along the streets 
in his speech ortega equated his main rival in sundays voting 
the united national opposition with the ussupported contra 
rebels who have hounded his government since 1981 but not posed a 
serious threat for months 
he said the rebel force and the opposition coalition which 
ortega grouped as the heirs of ousted dictator anastasio somoza 
had caused harm to nicaragua 
but on february 26 once we win the elections im going to 
send them the bill and ill tell them that since the debt is so 
large and unpayable we are going to forgive it ortega told 
supporters 
the rally marked the official end of campaigning a threeday 
cooling off period begins today 
the election is seen as a referendum on 10 years of sandinista 
rule 
voters will choose among 10 presidential candidates although 
only ortega and the opposition coalition candidate violeta barrios 
de chamorro have a chance to win 
the 175 million registered voters will also select a 
vicepresident 90 national assembly delegates representatives for 
144 town and city councils and two regional councils for the 
atlantic coast 
the organization of american states the united nations and a 
host of other groups will field 1500 election observers to ensure 
the balloting is fair 
in a speech sprinkled with religious allusions ortega told the 
crowd wednesday night that the sandinista front has its roots in 
christianity because it chooses to side with the poor of this 
predominantly roman catholic country 
he quoted a passage from the bible in which solomon asks god for 
wisdom 
i say lord give me wisdom to govern give me wisdom to be 
just give me wisdom to forgive ortega said 
he called the sandinista revolution unique and said he hoped it 
would become an example to the people of latin america and the 
world 
here neither the communist model nor the capitalist model is 
any good the sandinista model is the one that belongs to 
nicaraguans ortega said thats what revolutionary knowledge 
and experience tell us that we dont have to copy anybody 
in the past the sandinistas have expropriated land and major 
industries from private owners and nationalized them most 
recently in june they seized three major sugar refining plants 
and three coffee plantations 
the sandinista rally drew truck and busloads of supporters from 
as far away as boaco 60 miles to the east 
richard boldan a farmer from the boaco area agreed the economy 
had been bad inflation was 1700 percent last year but said his 
lot had improved under the sandinistas 
if the situation has been difficult it is because of the 
war said boldan referring to the long guerrilla war waged by 
the contras 
ortega said the sandinista victory would make the united states 
respect nicaragua after a decade of hostility the us congress 
cut off military aid to the rebels in february 1988 but kept up 
nonlethal aid to put pressure on the sandinistas to hold free 
elections 
we want the peace of the man who is respected ortega said 
and that is what we always have demanded from the north american 
government respect 
the sandinistas put on a lively show with dance troupes rock 
singers fireworks and bands 
nearly everyone in the crowd had a sandinista campaign memento 
tshirts in bright colors with daniel presidente or pictures of 
other candidates baseball caps keychains belt buckles or 
headbands 
ortega claimed a crowd of 500000 but experienced observers 
estimated it at about 300000 still almost five times what mrs 
chamorro drew at her closing rally sunday 
despite a huge campaign effort and opinion polls that generally 
give ortega the lead uncertainty about the outcome lingered 
many nicaraguans are reluctant to speak their minds to strangers 
and the large sandinista rallies appeared padded by public 
employees and others pressured to attend 
in washington the state department said wednesday that 
nicaraguan authorities have been routinely threatening opposition 
party activists as part of a campaign to influence the elections 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said that opposition 
sympathizers have told the us embassy in managua that government 
security agents have threatened them with loss of job or land 
bodily harm or even death 
mrs tutwiler said supporters of mrs chamorro in the military 
have had their voter registration cards confiscated and opposition 
poll watchers have been threatened not to show up on election

the senate judiciary committee appears set to 
approve the nomination of conservative civil rights official 
clarence thomas to become a federal appeals judge despite sharp 
lastminute criticism from a member of the panel 
sen howard m metzenbaum dohio circulated a letter among 
judiciary committee members on tuesday declaring that he was 
unsatisfied with answers provided by thomas to the committee last 
week 
as chairman of the equal employment opportunity commission 
thomas has been one of the most visible blacks in the reagan and 
bush administrations and his opposition to affirmative action 
programs and quotas along with his other conservative views have 
drawn sharp criticism from civil rights forces 
at his confirmation hearing last week thomas said state and 
local agencies were primarily to blame for the lapse without action 
of more than 900 cases of alleged job discrimination in recent 
years 
critics from womens and senior citizens groups said at the time 
that the number of lapsed cases actually ran into the thousands 
and metzenbaum said in his letter tuesday that the responsibility 
rested with the commission itself 
metzenbaum said he was not opposing thomas because of the 
chairmans political beliefs but because of his remarks on the law 
at the hearing 
as the committee vote approached however civil rights forces 
appeared resigned to senate approval of thomas 
some of the steam went out of the drive to block confirmation 
when benjamin hooks head of the national association for the 
advancement of colored people announced a day before the hearing 
that he would not stand in the way of placing thomas on the court 
if confirmed he would take the place of robert bork on the us 
court of appeals for the district of columbia often described as 
the nations second highest court because it is located in the 
nations capital it frequently is called on to decide major 
governmental cases and it has often been a springboard to the us 
supreme court 
bork resigned after being rejected by the senate for elevation 
to the supreme court in the most bitter judicial fight of recent 
years 
thomas born in poverty in rural georgia is a graduate of yale 
law school and his career has been aided by close ties to sen john 
c danforth rmo 
he worked for danforth both in his senate office and when 
danforth was attorney general of the state of missouri 
thomas was recommended to the panel at his confirmation hearing 
by danforth and by sens sam nunn dga and charles robb dva

before the two germanys unite they owe it 
to poland to agree to a peace treaty guaranteeing this 
countrys western border prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki 
insisted 
at a rare news conference wednesday mazowiecki also reiterated 
the polish position that soviet troops should remain in their 
country as insurance 
we believe that a new stage of history created by the 
reunification of germany must not be entered with any ambiguity 
concerning polands western border he said emphasizing his 
demand that decisions affecting polands security not be made 
without its participation 
we are demanding that before the reunification the total 
removal of these ambiguities must take place 
mazowiecki proposed that after east german elections in march 
the two germanys and poland initial a treaty corresponding with 
a peace treaty recognizing the postworld war ii borders and 
that it be signed finally by the government of a unified germany 
he said such an agreement could be negotiated with polands 
participation at the reunification talks planned by the two 
germanys and the four victorious world war ii allies the united 
states soviet union britain and france 
a third of presentday poland was territory forfeited by germany 
after world war ii compensating for an even larger eastern polish 
territory annexed by the soviet union 
east germany and west germany have individually signed 
agreements recognizing the polands western border but west german 
chancellor helmut kohl some of whose political supporters still 
consider the lands part of germany has said he cannot make 
promises about the border on behalf of a unified germany 
mazowiecki has demanded a seat at the sixparty unification 
talks when the security of germanys neighbors is discussed and he 
said wednesday that polands ambassadors are delivering letters to 
the four allies outlining its position 
it is unthinkable in todays democratic world to have this 
form of yalta when one group of countries could decide about 
another he said referring to the 1945 conference when the 
allied leaders reworked polands borders and ceded eastern europe 
to soviet hegemony 
west germany has rejected a role for poland at the talks saying 
the unification proposal concerns only the territory of the two 
germanys 
the united states also has indicated opposition but mazowiecki 
said he would not consider the position final 
east german prime minister hans modrow has expressed full 
understanding for polands position and his foreign minister 
oskar fischer said wednesday that a united germany must give full 
legal recognition to polands western border fischer also warned 
of rapid unification adding his voice to those of other warsaw 
pact officials who say the process is moving too quickly 
there have been expressions of support from great britian 
mazowiecki said while france has not made an official statement 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev said in an interview 
published wednesday that a united germany must guarantee the 
postwar borders of poland which nazi germany invaded in 1939 to 
touch off world war ii 
unlike czechoslovakia and hungary poland has not pushed for the 
removal of soviet troops mazowieckis solidaritydominated 
government has said the soviet troops should remain as insurance 
against germany 
mazowiecki said he is aware that the public favors the 
withdrawal of soviet troops but we assess this situation 
realistically in the perspective of the germany problem and thus 
at the moment do not put this issue in such a category

the justice department says the fbi wont have 
to cut 400 agents from its payroll next year because it has found 
new ways to save money under president bushs proposed budget for 
fiscal 1991 
the costcutting measures were worked out in the last few weeks 
since bushs budget proposal was sent to congress justice 
spokesman david runkel said wednesday 
the proposed budget would have forced the fbi to cut more than 
400 agents from its workforce of more than 10000 probably through 
attrition to finance an estimated 42 million in additional 
overtime expenses 
a new law passed by congress last year increases the overtime 
pay for federal law enforcement officers including fbi agents 
under the new plan to pay for the overtime costs the fbi will 
stagger the hiring of 338 new agents provided in the 1991 budget to 
investigate organized crime drugs and whitecollar fraud said an 
fbi official 
their hiring will be spread out over the 1991 fiscal year to 
save money said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the fbi also will postpone the purchase of some new equipment the

the rocky flats weapons plant in colorado 
closed indefinitely late last year for safety and management 
improvements is unlikely to resume full production until at least 
july a senior energy department official says 
the plant situated about 16 miles northwest of denver is the 
sole supplier of plutonium triggers for us nuclear warheads 
which are vital to maintaining the nuclear weapons stockpile 
neither the energy department nor the pentagon has said how long 
rocky flats could remain out of service before the arms stockpile 
would be jeopardized 
the plant also was closed for a few months in 1988 after a 
worker was contaminated by radioactivity 
energy secretary james d watkins had said shortly after the 
latest shutdown that he hoped rocky flats would resume production 
by february but the contractor that runs the facility says it 
needs more time to install new safety procedures and retrain 
workers 
adm jm barr the deputy assistant energy secretary for 
military application said wednesday that one of the key plutonium 
processing facilities could be ready to resume operation by the end 
of june 
barr said current plans called for the full resumption of rocky 
flats production sometime between july and september although that 
was subject to revision 
barr told the advisory committee on nuclear facility safety 
which is monitoring progress toward resuming operations that he 
would have a more specific target date very early in april 
barr stressed that the final decision to resume production 
rested with watkins who in recent weeks has pledged to subject the 
plant overhaul to a full review by independent observers 
rocky flats has been plagued by a variety of operating and 
wastehandling problems in recent years

the selection of a heavy metal rock song 
for graduation ceremonies at a high school has created a dilemna 
for the student council president 
instead of edward elgars pomp and circumstance seniors at 
harmony grove high school picked i remember you by skid row for 
their traditional exit walk after the awarding of diplomas 
the council president 17yearold jennifer miller said this 
week that her baptist beliefs dont allow me to listen to that 
type of music 
her mother janet miller said jennifer has never been allowed 
to listen to heavy metal music because of what she called its drug 
messages and antireligion overtones 
ms miller said the song and group were inappropriate for the 
spring graduation i believe the reputations of groups like skid 
row suggests their own nature 
i support her 100 percent mrs miller said 
superintendent dan henley and high school principal billy gibbs 
reviewed the song and declined to intervene 
if the song had contained any reference to drugs or anything 
that could be considered immoral we would have rejected it 
henley said 
ms miller said she wanted to attend the ceremony but would not 
walk in the seniors walk 
i have the right to have my diploma handed to me during the 
ceremony and not sent to me through the mail she said 
but henley disagreed 
if ms miller refuses to take part in the senior walk he said 
she will not be permitted to receive the diploma on stage and it 
will be mailed to her 
gibbs said parents of other students in this town 25 miles 
southwest of little rock would be embarassed if ms miller left 
early or stayed seated during the song 
it would look like a visible protest he said parents 
should not be put through that 
henley said ms miller could appeal his decision to the district 
school board

the worlds two largest cocainegrowing 
countries have rejected a us idea to put cocachewing 
caterpillars in their fields saying the insects might also ravage 
other crops 
the us agriculture department is studying the potential for 
using such insects to kill coca plants in bolivia and peru 
president bush has asked for 65 million for the program 
involving the malumbia moth whose larvae eat coca leaves the moth 
is native to perus huallaga valley where more coca grows than 
anywhere else in the world 
but bolivian and peruvian officials said wednesday that 
washington should instead spend its time and money helping their 
farmers switch from coca to other crops 
the worm is not needed here said carlos guillen a peruvian 
government spokesman in lima what the government wants is to 
replace the coca crop with other crops such as coffee cacao and 
palm oil trees 
many studies have been made in peru concerning this worm as a 
means of eradicating the coca crop guillen said and the 
government views crop substitution as a better solution than 
eradication 
he said use of the worms could endanger citrus trees and other 
crops 
osvaldo antezana of bolivias interior department said 
wednesday the government rejects any such ideas because the plan 
presented in the cartagena drug summit calls for alternative 
development that would take place with the participation of 
farmers 
bolivian farmers supported their governments position 
by using bugs the americans would be confirming that they do 
not have any political will to solve the social and economic 
problems in bolivia said segundino montevilla of the 
confederation of bolivian peasants if it is true this would 
mean that the famous cartagena drug summit made no sense 
antezana the undersecretary for alternative development said 
bolivias policies are clear and concrete they are based on the 
voluntary reduction of coca plants with economic compensation 
without the use of chemical products or biological agents 
mauro bertero the agriculture minister said i do not 
believe the united states would attempt something like this without 
the approval of the government of bolivia that would not fit in 
with the dialogue and agreements reached at cartagena 
at the summit a week ago between bush and the leaders of 
colombia peru and bolivia us officials agreed to provide aid 
in developing other crops peru produces most of the worlds coca 
which is processed into cocaine and bolivia grows about onethird 
of it 
the agriculture department research program was reported tuesday 
by the washington post and white house press secretary marlin 
fitzwater said later we are not undertaking any biological war 
neither troops nor caterpillars will go in without prior request 
and consultation 
more than 300000 farmers in bolivia and 200000 in peru depend 
on coca for their livelihood peru estimates sales of the leaves 
bring 1 billion into the country each year and bolivia earns up 
to 500 million a year from coca 
bolivian farmers have destroyed 4940 acres of coca plants since 
jan 1 in return for payments of about 800 per acre 
antezana said the voluntary eradication program had gotten 
bigger since december because of a sharp drop in coca prices 
resulting from colombias crackdown on cocaine traffickers and 
increased interdiction within bolivia

a worldwide warming over the past 30 years is 
almost certainly related to increases in carbon dioxide in the 
atmosphere according to a statistical study published today 
detailed analysis found that there is only about two chances in 
a million that the two trends are not linked researchers said 
but that does not prove that the carbon dioxide was triggering 
the global warming they said 
many scientists are concerned that continued buildup of carbon 
dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere may lead to global 
warming that could alter climates through an atmospheric process 
called the greenhouse effect 
but researchers disagree over whether gas buildup has caused any 
detectable warming yet 
the statistical analysis is presented in todays issue of the 
british journal nature by cynthia kuo craig lindberg and david 
thomson of atampt bell labs in murray hill nj 
their work used observations of atmospheric carbon dioxide 
concentrations taken monthly since march 1958 at the summit of 
mauna loa in hawaii the values are typical of measurements made at 
several sites the researchers said 
they compared the concentrations to monthly averages of global 
temperature from 1958 to 1988 and found a strong statistical 
relationship between shortterm fluctuations in the two trends 
that means there is probably some physical link between the 
two trends but theres no way to say which is causing which 
lindberg said in a recent interview 
some third factor such as increased energy output from the sun 
may be causing both observed trends he said 
the analysis found that changes in carbon dioxide concentrations 
lagged behind those in temperature by five months that might occur 
if warmer temperatures cause carbon dioxide to emerge from oceans 
or elsewhere in the environment lindberg and thomson said in 
telephone interviews 
in a nature editorial researcher tp barnett of the scripps 
institution of oceanography in la jolla calif also said that the 
studys limitations mean it cannot be taken as proof of warming due 
to carbon dioxide

four us congressmen have been denied 
permission to travel to the independenceminded soviet republic of 
lithuania for this weekends elections the legislators said 
the lawmakers had hoped to pick up visas at the soviet consulate 
in east berlin but the soviets sent them a cable advising us that 
we would not be allowed to witness the lithuanian elections rep 
richard durbin said wednesday 
the illinois democrat and three colleagues were selected by 
congress to observe the local elections saturday after an 
invitation was received from the lithuanian national movement 
sajudis 
its very frustrating were running into the limits of 
glasnost apparently said john miller rwash the members of 
the party were reps christopher cox rcalif and bill sarpalius 
dtexas 
lithuania and the other soviet baltic republics latvia and 
estonia want more freedom from moscow and the elections will 
test the strength of nationalists in lithuania 
in december lithuanias communist party became the first 
regional party in the country to break with moscow and declare 
itself independent soviet president mikhail s gorbachev later 
visited the republic in an attempt to dissuade the secessionits but 
met with little success 
durbin was asked if the soviets had specified reasons for the 
visa denial 
he said they were told they hadnt gone through the appropriate 
procedures 
but frankly that conflicts with the fact that other 
parliamentarians from canada and austria are presently in 
lithuania it appears that they have made some special ruling as 
the denial relates only to members of congress from the united 
states 
in moscow foreign ministry spokesman vadim perfiliev said the 
congressmen had not been invited by any officially recognized 
groups and said their trip was not coordinated or discussed through 
diplomatic channels 
taking all these facts into account the congressmen were 
informed that their trip to the ussr at present would be 
incorrect he said 
this decision of course is in no connection with the 
personalities of the congressmen they are welcome in the ussr 
at any convenient date which could be mutually agreed upon 
durbin said the delegation would continue to press for 
permission to go to lithuania and would contact washington to 
rally some support to pressure the soviets 
we still have time to make it to lithuania before the 
election durbin said 
lithuania latvia and estonia were independent states between 
world war i and 1940 when they were annexed by the soviet union

researchers said today they had found clumps of 
galaxies occurring in an apparently regular pattern over a vast 
distance a finding that clashes with current understanding of the 
universe 
it was surprising enough to find clumps of galaxies rather than 
a more uniform distribution over such a large scale but to find 
the regularity is just mindboggling said study coauthor david 
koo 
gravity would not have enough time since the birth of the 
universe to produce the pattern over such a huge scale so the find 
may be a fossil imprint from the very early universe he said 
but another scientist familiar with the study said he believes 
the findings are merely a statistical fluke rather than a real 
pattern 
this is so counter to our other notions about the universe 
that im going to treat it skeptically unless its really proven 
conclusively said marc davis of the university of california 
berkeley 
the new work is presented in todays issue of the british 
journal nature by koo of the university of california santa cruz 
alexander szalay of johns hopkins university in baltimore and 
researchers in england 
they surveyed galaxies in two opposite directions from the milky 
way galaxy which includes earth 
within these narrow lines of sight researchers found about a 
dozen clumps of galaxies separated by approximately evenly spaced 
gaps of 400 million to 800 million lightyears koo said wednesday 
a lightyear is the distance light travels in a year about 588 
trillion miles 
the calculated distance between clumps depends on ones 
assumptions about how fast the universe is expanding 
the gaps were not completely empty of galaxies the milky way 
for example resides between two clumps in about the middle of the 
overall series the researchers observed koo said 
koo said researchers are now looking elsewhere to see if the 
regularity shows up again if the pattern is proven it would force 
a revamping or abandonment of currently popular theories about the 
development of the universe he said 
davis agreed that the proven existence of such a pattern would 
require a fundamental rethinking of theories about the very 
early universe it is totally outside the domain of any physics 
we have thought of he said

the tokyo stock exchanges main index fluctuated 
wildly today but ended up rebounding moderately from its plunge of 
more than 3 percent the previous day while the dollar inched up 
against the japanese yen 
the 225issue nikkei stock average which fell 116119 points 
wednesday in its third biggest singleday decline gained back 
9251 points or 025 percent on thursday closing at 3582684 
the index rose more than 400 points in todays early trading 
but then plunged on a wave of computerguided selling by foreign 
institutions seeking to capitalize on price differences between 
shares for immediate delivery and those for future delivery 
at the end of the morning session it was 40597 points below 
the previous days close but it recovered as investors who had 
been waiting uncertainly on the sidelines gradually returned to 
the market in the afternoon 
mike morizumi an analyst with merrill lynch said these 
investors thought the market had hit bottom when the index fell to 
35000 
but he said a real upward push for stock prices was unlikely 
before the central bank acts on its official discount rate the 
interest charged for loans to commercial banks 
the market has been speculating on a discount rate increase 
following last sundays parliamentary elections higher interest 
rates tend to discourage stock investment and dealers said 
investors hesitated to make major purchases now 
central bank officials have said they still are watching 
economic conditions 
dealers and analysts said a wave of computerguided selling by 
foreign institutional investors has been a major causes of the 
nikkei indexs recent decline 
because only a small volume of shares is being traded such 
massive selling by computer can easily send the entire market 
falling said keiichi nishida of kidder peabody securities 
volume traded on the exchanges first section was estimated at 
550 million shares up from 450 million wednesday 
in the foreign exchange market the dollar closed at 14523 yen 
up 008 yen from wednesdays close of 14515 yen it opened at 
14545 yen and ranged between 14515 yen and 14548 yen 
in the last three days the dollar has edged up a total of 071 
yen 
market players cannot figure out the market direction and 
they are just taking a waitandsee stance so far said akiko 
kobayashi a bank of tokyo trader

the us supreme court may have paved the 
way for thousands of miles of hiking and biking paths by rejecting 
a couples appeal of a law allowing unused railway lines to be 
converted into nature trails 
the justices wednesday unanimously rejected an appeal by j paul 
preseault and his wife patricia who said a 1983 federal law known 
as the railstotrails act trampled their property rights to 
satisfy the nations backtonature and physicalfitness boom 
i guess at this point im stunned j paul preseault said 
i didnt do this go all the way to the supreme court to have 
them tell me to file my case in another court i wasnt looking for 
money i wanted my property rights honored 
the ruling could affect a large number of property owners the 
nations railway system at its peak in 1920 with 272000 miles of 
track is now down to 141000 miles and 3000 more miles are 
abandoned each year 
justice william j brennan said the railstotrails law is a 
legitimate exercise of congressional power aimed at encouraging 
the development of additional recreational trails 
but preseault said the public recreation path that runs through 
his lakefront property in burlington violates the us 
constitutions fifth amendment which bars the taking of private 
property without just compensation and also said it interferes 
unlawfully with interstate commerce 
brennan said preseault still can file a claim for compensation 
against the federal government under a separate law 
preseault said wednesday he intends to fight for compensation 
the opinion is a strong reaffirmation of the requirement that 
government can be asked for compensation said presaults 
attorney michael berger of los angeles the supreme court is 
saying the federal claims court is there for compensation for this 
kind of taking of property 
ownership of the land claimed by the preseaults is in dispute 
vermont officials say the property belongs to the state 
but if the preseaults own the property they say they have a 
right under vermont law to use the land once the rail line is 
abandoned 
the 1983 federal law an amended version of the earlier 
national trails system act allows for railroad rightsofway to 
be maintained for possible future railroad use while the land is 
converted at least temporarily to nature trails 
this practice known as rail banking is at the heart of 
wednesdays ruling 
vermont entered into a lease with the city of burlington that 
allows the city to maintain the rightofway as a trail while 
preserving it for possible rail use 
the preseaults said the railbanking provisions are a sham to 
conceal the true purpose of the federal law preventing railroad 
rightsofway from being returned to their rightful owners after 
abandonment 
the couple said the railbanking procedure disguises the fact 
that the rail lines have been abandoned 
brennan rejected that argument 
the law is not invalid merely because more draconian measures 
such as a program of mandatory conversions or a prohibition of 
all abandonments might advance more completely the railbanking 
purpose he said the history of congressional attempts to 
address the problem of rail abandonments provides sufficient reason 
to defer to congress he added

legislatures in south carolina and michigan gave their final 
approval to bills requiring parental consent for teenagers seeking 
abortions 
the bill passed wednesday by the south carolina house requires 
consent by a parent or other guardian for girls under 17 a 
spokesman said gov carroll campbell backed the bill but wanted to 
read the fine print before signing it 
in michigan gov james blanchard said he would veto the bill 
which passed the house by a 6542 vote the bills supporters 
acknowleged they lacked the necessary 74 votes for an override in 
the 110member house 
the bill earlier had passed in the michigan senate 
barbara listing president of right to life of michigan said 
backers of the bill will try to mount a petition drive to put the 
issue on a statewide ballot the group used that approach when it 
successfully sought to ban statefunded abortions for poor women 
were pleased the parents will be pleased it will be the 
abortion clinics that wont be pleased because it will cut into 
their business listing said 
but abortion rights advocates interpreted the votes margin as a 
victory for their movement 
we won its over they lost said rep maxine berman a 
democrat what this bill is all about is intimidating women into 
motherhood 
blanchard said the abortion consent bill is unreasonable 
i would veto it for a lot of reasons first of which is it 
would deny any help to women victimized by sex crimes rape and 
incest other abuse blanchard said i think thats 
unreasonable 
the bill would allow pregnant girls under 18 who felt they 
couldnt approach one of their parents about an abortion or were 
denied permission to seek a waiver from a judge 
the south carolina bill requires girls under 17 to get the 
permission of a parent grandparent guardian or judge before 
obtaining an abortion it offers no exception for girls who have 
been raped 
parents who deny their daughters request for an abortion would 
have to share legal and financial responsibility for their 
daughters offspring until their daughter reaches the age of 18 
the south carolina senate already approved the bill 
the governor endorses the concept of parental consent but 
wants to read the fine print before he signs the bill into law 
said tucker eskew campbells spokesman 
rep wes hayes the bills sponsor hailed the passage and 
termed the measure profamily legislation 
it says that we want to have somebody else involved in the 
decision process other than just that 16yearold and the abortion 
clinic said hayes a democrat 
south carolina law now requires a girl under 16 to obtain a 
parents consent for an abortion but the law has not been enforced

china today strongly protested a us state 
department report that accuses it of widespread human rights 
abuses insisting the reports contents are based on lies and 
hearsay 
however a foreign ministry spokesman refused to say if his 
government planned to retaliate in any way past responses to 
foreign criticism often have contained warnings that relations 
would be damaged 
the chinese government and people express their utmost 
indignation at this report which violates the basic norms 
governing international relations said the spokesman li 
zhaoxing reading a prepared statement at the ministrys weekly 
news conference 
the foreign ministry hereby lodges a strong protest with 
the us government li said 
the state department report issued wednesday contained 
washingtons strongest public criticism ever of china under senior 
leader deng xiaoping a man whom three american presidents have 
toasted as a friend 
its comprehensive listing of abuses from torture and secret 
executions to pervasive surveillance of daily life was expected to 
halt the slight warming of uschinese relations that followed the 
december visit of national security adviser brent scowcroft 
a western diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity 
predicted that official chinese contacts with the us embassy in 
beijing would drop off sharply 
the embassy experienced similarly chilly relations with many 
chinese government units in the first months after the armys june 
34 crackdown on prodemocracy protesters in beijing 
official newspapers then carried daily attacks on the united 
states for criticizing the armys killing of hundreds of 
protesters and for sheltering dissidents fang lizhi and his wife 
however relations began improving in the last months of 1989 
following visits of former president richard nixon and scowcroft 
the official response to the state department report said the 
report was based on guesses and rumors 
the repeated acts of grossly interfering in chinas internal 
affairs are but expressions of outandout hegemonism and power 
politics it said 
it also accused the united states of failing to solve its own 
extremely serious human rights problems and of violating the 
rights of panamanians when it invaded their country in december to 
oust manuel antonio noriega 
asked to give examples of material in the report that is based 
on rumor or lies li told journalists to read the chinese press for 
the truth and added you might also find answers to your 
question by resorting to what we in china call a selfexamination 
li refused to say how many people are being held without trial 
in connection with the protests thousands were arrested in beijing 
alone after the crackdown began and many have not yet been 
formally charged 
the state department report criticized chinese judicial 
procedure and called prison conditions invariably harsh and 
frequently degrading 
it noted an official chinese report last year said about 2 
million chinese were sent to labor camps in the past decade 
it also noted close monitoring and control of personal life in 
china including surveillance by neighborhood watch committees 
opening of mail tapping of telephones and stationing of cameras on 
roads and in buildings

fifthgrader for talking in class 
but the school district placed kenneth roberts 20 on 
administrative leave and started its own investigation into the 
episode 
i will delay any judgment about mr roberts until the facts 
are in said adams county schools superintendent michael 
massarotti regardless of whether the child had been asthmatic or 
not we would have taken the same course of action 
roberts said he put tape over the berkeley gardens elementary 
school students mouth after the boy yelled across the room and 
ignored his requests to quiet down he said the boy was not hurt 
and he learned the student had a history of asthma only after the 
incident 
the sheriffs office began investigating last thursday after 
principal kathleen bassett reported the students mouth was shut 
with masking tape for about 20 minutes 
this matter was investigated by detectives it was 
determined there was no violation of criminal law said robert 
neiman a sheriffs office spokesman 
the boys name was not released his mother sherrie rivera 
said she was real disappointed with roberts weve discussed 
his talking problems and the teacher has been patient we just 
wish he hadnt gone this far 
she said the boys asthma requires constant medication we 
always carry an inhaler with him this could have been really 
bad

the happy land of kids tv has turned nasty 
with an antitrust suit brought by the walt disney co against the 
fox broadcasting co and its affiliates over foxs planned 
childrens programming 
disney alleged in the suit filed in us district court 
wednesday that fox has attempted to prevent its 129 affiliated 
stations from carrying the disney afternoon a twohour daily 
lineup of childrens programming in syndication 
fox soon will introduce its own childrens network of daily 
shows with the first program set to debut in september both 
disney and fox are selling their childrens shows on condition that 
they be broadcast from 3 pm and 5 pm 
the suit seeks unspecified compensatory damages punitive 
damages and a permanent injunction 
disney claimed in the suit that fox has intimidated its 
affiliate stations with threats that the stations will be dropped 
by fox if they take the disney lineup 
american kids have voted through their viewing habits and have 
consistently and unarguably determined that disney animated 
programming is their no 1 choice for afternoon viewing richard 
frank president of the disney studio said in a statement 
having lost this battle fox now wants to deprive children of 
these shows by coercing its affiliates to buy foxs programming 
rather than disneys frank said 
but kevin obrien president of the oversight committee for the 
fox childrens network said that the disney suit reeks of 
absurdity and its nothing more than a scare tactic 
he said that fox has made it repeatedly clear that fox would 
allow its stations the flexibility they need to show disneys 
kids lineup 
the fox childrens lineup starts with a daily half hour and 
three hours each saturday this september additional half hours to 
the daily schedule are set to be added later

a judge ordered all proceedings sealed in 
relation to a man under investigation in the recent mail bombings 
that killed a judge and a civil rights lawyer 
attorneys for walter leroy moody had asked us district judge 
richard c freeman to issue a gag order seal all documents in the 
case and order the return of items confiscated from searches of 
moodys home storage area and vehicles 
freeman said wednesday the publics interest in seeing the 
arrest of the person or persons responsible for the middecember 
bombings outweighed interest in daytoday developments 
peter canfield and terry adamson attorneys representing the 
atlanta journalconstitution and wsbtv said they planned to file 
an appeal with the 11th us circuit court of appeals today 
adamson said the appeals court could overturn freemans entire 
ruling or find that portions of the proceedings could be released 
to the press just as portions of the videotaped testimony of 
former president ronald reagan in the irancontra case were 
released this week 
moodys attorneys michael hauptman and bruce harvey said they 
could not comment on any aspect of the proceedings moody did not 
respond to questions 
freeman said public access into moodyrelated documents could 
jeopardize the investigation if a conspiracy is involved 
agents investigating the mail bombs have extensively searched 
the homes and businesses of three men in alabama and georgia 
including moodys clayton county home two weeks ago 
no one has been charged in the attacks which killed judge 
robert s vance of the 11th us circuit court of appeals and 
robert robinson a savannah attorney

once there were 28 categories of grammy awards 
now there are 76 but unlike tvs emmy awards show which has 
become an epic in bloat cbs telecast of the grammy awards moved 
along right smartly 
true wednesday nights 32nd annual grammy awards show from los 
angeles aired live only on the east coast ran 37 minutes over its 
threehour schedule true host garry shandling was a tad less than 
exuberant 
but you rarely had the feeling as one often does on emmy night 
that every single winner would get to say thanks to everyone the 
winner knew be it mother agent or third assistant cousin 
there was a whole lot of thankin going on make no mistake the 
laconic jazz great miles davis did it in two short bursts saying 
thank you and upon sighting a standing ovation for him 
saying thank you again 
two other winners were even moved to thank their lawyers 
but executive producer pierre cossette who has been doing 
grammy shows almost since the golden age of silent television 
fashioned a wellpaced evening 
he gave a representative sampling of tunes and music forms 
presenters who got to the point fast and surprisingly few overly 
grateful winners 
the music worlds annual salaam to itself only really sagged 
when it spent about 20 minutes hailing the thoughts words music 
and video clips of paul mccartney whose name often is prefaced 
with the phrase former beatle 
all this salute lacked was the intelligence that fellow former 
beatle george harrison had his tonsils taken out on feb 8 1969 
mccartney proved a gracious visitor though he didnt even 
wince at the preliminaries a solemn speech by beatles fan meryl 
streep 
she or her speechwriter left the impression that he could make 
the the lame walk and the tonedeaf hear noting that his fine 
music not only had an impact on rock n roll but also on western 
culture 
the mccartney hoopla was due to his grammyknighting for a 
lifetime of musical achievement davis was similarly honored 
although late in the show when it was in overtime but he played 
his horn and sounded fine 
wednesdays show which among other things featured the first 
televised grammy award for rap music served as a reminder that 
rock no longer is for and by the young 
there were a few sprouts about on stage notably the 
distinguished new rock group milli vanilli which has one recent 
hit with lyrics that go girl you know its true ooo ooo ooo 
 
but you also saw that rock n roll is here to gray there was 
mccartney youthfullooking but 47 and grammy winner bette 
midler only three years younger and fourtime winner bonnie 
raitt 40 
we all get ancient its part of lifes rich pageant but you 
just dont think of rock stars getting ancient too the grammy 
show however disproved this notion 
it left a distinct feeling that if someone ever makes a tv 
series about todays rock stars it probably will be called 
fortysomething

the only leper colony in the continental 
united states will be converted to a health care center for elderly 
and crippled federal prisoners officials said 
us rep clyde holloway rla said wednesday that the 
agreement between the bureau of prisons and the public health 
service should be signed early next week 
the 130 leprosy patients who live at the gillis w long hansens 
disease center in carville about 70 miles west of new orleans would 
be allowed to remain holloway said 
its a winwin situation holloway said 
the 340acre facility in an isolated curve of river will be 
able to hold about 1000 prisoners he said 
it was the last us public health service hospital in the 
country the federal research project on leprosy now known as 
hansens disease will be moved from the center 20 miles up the 
mississippi river to baton rouge 
the colony opened in 1894 on an old plantation the federal 
government took control in 1921 and as many as 500 residents lived 
there during the 1930s 
the center has treated nearly 3000 patients and survived the 
1984 reagan administration budget cuts when seven other public 
health service hospitals closed 
all major advances in leprosy treatment drugs 
armadillorelated discoveries and two generations of vaccines with 
limited effectiveness came from carvilles researchers said 
center director john duffy 
leprosy a bacterial infection causes nerve damage that can 
result in loss of muscle control crippling of the hands and feet 
and blindness most cases can be treated before complications set 
in and treatment makes the disease noncontagious 
two hundred to 300 new cases are diagnosed every year with an 
estimated 10000 us victims and 20 million worldwide

a meeting between president 
fw de klerk and leaders of five black african nations has been 
postponed following protests from opposition groups and other 
nations government officials said today 
in a statement the government said de klerk would not be 
attending a meeting saturday in zaire to discuss regional problems 
and recent developments in south africa it said the meeting would 
be held later but gave no date 
in another development the foreign ministry said foreign 
minister pik bothas visit to angola and kenya this week had been 
postponed the ministry gave no reasons for the postponement 
beyond citing fighting in angola

after years of isolation 
south african officials said earlier this week that de klerk 
would meet the leaders of burundi the central african republic 
chad rwanda and zaire in the first summit between south africa and 
black african nations the meeting was presented as a major 
breakthrough 
it reportedly was arranged by zaires president mobutu sese 
seko 
but the african national congress the main south african 
antiapartheid group protested and urged the organization of 
african unity to block the meeting the anc said the south african 
government still supported apartheid and any contacts by black 
african nations would be premature 
several other black states condemned the meeting with de klerk 
and urged the participants not to take part chad denied it had 
been been invited 
de klerk legalized the anc and released top black leader nelson 
mandela from prison this month to try and clear the way for talks 
on ending white minority rule and sharing political power with 
blacks 
the anc has said it will send a delegation to meet with de klerk

the defense minister says the 
army wont block an inquiry into charges that he and other top 
generals were linked to a secret unit that killed antiapartheid 
activists according to reports today 
the opposition democratic party called for defense minister gen 
magnus malans dismissal the liberal partys leader wynand malan 
said the government must remove the minister immediately or it will 
be seen as supporting death squads 
gen malan denied he had ordered any killings or been involved 
in any illegal activities the state south african broadcasting 
corp reported he said an investigation would exonerate the 
defense forces 
malan made the statement pledging no army interference in the 
investigation after the star newspaper reported wednesday that it 
had uncovered evidence that malan and senior generals were linked 
to the activities of a secret south african defense force unit 
allegedly linked to death squad operations 
the star citing unidentified sources reported that malan and 
other senior officials were linked to a secret unit called the 
civil cooperation bureau which used civilian personnel to conceal 
the armys attempts to manipulate political affairs 
the newspaper reported the chain of command for the unit ran 
from malans office to gen jannie geldenhuys chief of the south 
african defense forces to gen witkop badenhorst chief of 
military intelligence and to maj gen eddie webb 
the unit funded by the military was commanded by col johan 
verster who reported directly to webb the newspaper said the 
report was the first to directly link death squad allegations to 
senior military figures 
the unit ran up to 16 cells across south africa and its 
activities were controlled by a special operations committee 
composed of defense force generals the newspaper said the unit 
also monitored black trade unions and helped coordinate action 
against activists based in other nations it said 
malan had been aware of the secret unit since it was set up in 
1987 the newspaper reported 
in a report today the star said hundreds of thousands of 
dollars in military funds had been misused by the secret unit to 
buy bmws and other luxury cars pay for houses and underwrite 
agents lavish lifestyles 
the lavish spending alarmed senior generals who began a secret 
inquiry to try and stop the abuses the newspaper reported 
president fw de klerk last month ordered an investigation into 
charges that military and police squads killed government 
opponents the commission is expected to investigate the 
unexplained deaths of at least 60 antiapartheid activists over the 
past decade 
three former police officers have confessed publicly to being 
involved in death squad activities and several police officers are 
under investigation for alleged involvement in death squad kilings 
no military officers have been charged or suspended in 
connection with the allegations 
malan said the attention focused on the death squad claims was 
diverting attention from antigovernment groups that had killed 
hundreds of people 
the actions of terrorists and aggressors who have claimed 
hundreds of innocent lives are being pushed into the background 
malan was quoted as saying today by johannesburg newspapers 
the president has legalized the african national congress and 
other antiapartheid groups as part of efforts to start talks on 
ending whiteminority rule and sharing political power with blacks 
de klerk has curbed the power of the security forces since 
taking office in august

a convicted murderer lost his bid to attend his 
mothers funeral after a judge upheld a state statute passed in 
response to the willie horton case 
superior court judge robert prince on wednesday refused to grant 
an appeal by the american civil liberties union to allow philip 
pennellatore to pay his respects on friday to the woman he called 
his best friend 
the ruling upheld a state law barring the temporary release of 
inmates serving life sentences for firstdegree murder 
the law was passed because of the furor over hortons assault on 
a maryland couple while on furlough a key issue used by president 
bush to cast doubt on gov michael s dukakis during the 1988 
presidential race 
pennellatore 29 was convicted of firstdegree murder in 1982 
for the 1981 killing of an 80yearold retired librarian he is 
serving a life sentence at the old colony correctional institute in 
bridgewater 
pennellatore originally asked for a court injunction to see his 
mother dying of pancreatic cancer on feb 5 then he sought to 
attend her funeral nettie pennellatore 61 died tuesday 
its good prison management its humane said john 
reinstein an american civil liberties union attorney who 
represented pennellatore 
reinstein said pennellatore and other inmates who have filed 
separate suits against the state department of correction argue 
that the willie horton law is an ex post facto law 
it basically went back and imposed additional punishment on 
prisoners already convicted of crimes reinstein said 
corrections department spokeswoman kathy robertson said it would 
take a court order or special legislation to allow a convicted 
lifer out for any occasion only three other states in the united 
states have no furlough system she said 
but the sponsor of the socalled willie horton statute rep 
larry giordano a democrat said he was not aware the bill banned 
prisoners from attending family funerals 
i would have no problem with that giordano said you only 
have one mother and father keeping firstdegree murderers behind 
bars is important to me but i have a little compassion 
maureen donovan who spearheaded the antifurlough campaign 
said she agreed with the policy 
he was the cause of a funeral himself said donovan if 
they let him out they are breaking the law

a tehran newspaper said today that the 
foreign hostages held in lebanon should be freed because they are 
being used as a propaganda tool against iran 
it was the first known statement by an iranian newspaper 
advocating the release of all the captives 
the englishlanguage tehran times said in an editorial that 
freeing the hostages was in line with islamic and humanitarian 
principles according to excerpts carried by the official islamic 
republic news agency 
regardless of the wests propaganda ploys moslem forces out 
of islamic and humanitarian considerations should work to get the 
hostages free with no precondition irna quoted the editorial as 
saying 
most of the 18 westerners held hostage in lebanon are believed 
in the hands of extremist shiite moslem factions loyal to tehran 
eight are americans the longest held is terry anderson chief 
middle east correspondent for the associated press he was abducted 
march 16 1985 
asked about the tehran times editorial andersons sister peggy 
say said i am deeply grateful it is encouraging i consider 
that iran is not part of the problem but part of the solution 
the hostages fate is believed linked to a power struggle within 
the iranian government the times is close to president hashemi 
rafsanjani who has offered to help free the hostages before but 
has been criticized for such moves by hardline government factions 
the editorial said the fight against western influence in the 
middle east was a legitimate one and should continue but that all 
the forces in lebanon should work to free the hostages regardless 
of their nationality 
they should regard the hostages as victims of imperialist 
policies of the west and make attempts to get them all freed the 
newspaper said 
maybe 1990 will be the year for the release of all the 
hostages the newspaper said 
the irna report monitored in nicosia said the west did not 
attach practical value to the hostage issue assigning more 
importance to westerners missing than those from other countries 
the newspaper repeated rafsanjanis demand for the release of

divers wearing iron helmets used 
sophisticated underwater camera gear to help them recover five more 
bodies from icedover convict lake including two victims who were 
at lake bottom 
after pulling what was the sixth of seven drowning victims from 
the lake late wednesday authorities halted the recovery effort to 
give exhausted divers a chance to recuperate 
search efforts have been suspended due to loss of resources 
and safety factors mono county sheriff martin a strelneck said 
in a statement the divers are getting tired and cold and its 
getting dangerous out there for them 
divers from los angeles county and washoe county nev will 
resume searching for the lone body still under the ice but no time 
was set to continue the effort he said 
the remaining body is that of dave meyers 53 of bishop the 
deaths caused by thin ice came monday meyers first day as a 
counselor at camp oneal a facility for troubled youths 
three teenagers from the camp were the first to plunge into the 
bonechilling waters of the highaltitude lake 
two bodies wrapped in yellow plastic bags were brought to shore 
about 320 pm wednesday moments before an underwater video 
camera found two more bodies at 100 feet 
a fifth body was recovered before the operation ended for the 
night 
divers on tuesday recovered the body of forest service ranger 
clayton cutter 31 one of four adults who died trying to save the 
three floundering teenagers 
recovered from the lake wednesday were the bodies of camp

vidar anderson 58 of long valley and camp residents david 
christopher sellers 15 of tulare shawn rayne diaz 15 of 
dinuba and ryan charles mccandless 13 of redlands 
the victims friends and relatives on wednesday questioned us 
forest service policies that leave judging ice thickness up to 
individual common sense at the hundreds of lakes in the rugged 
sierra nevada range 
they definitely need signs out there said tracey wood a 
friend of cutter i know people are going to be rebellious but 
before they advertise a lake for ice skating they better let people 
know how thin the ice is she said 
convict lake brochures tout its ice skating 
a remotecontrolled underwater camera lowered into the 32degree 
water helped divers locate two bodies on the lake bottom 117 feet 
below the surface said mono county sheriffs spokeswoman gail 
merritt 
the operation included a sixmember los angeles county sheriffs 
department deepdiving team and 11 divers from washoe county nev 
the los angeles dive team had iron helmets and surface air 
equipment allowing them to go deeper and stay down for up to 30 
minutes the camera guided them on the bottom of the 140foot deep 
lake 
the tragedy struck while 16 teenagers and two adults from camp 
oneal were on an outing at the lake at the 7500foot level in the 
eastern sierra nevada 
a preliminary sheriffs department investigation completed 
wednesday said the teenagers were playing not skating on the 
milelong quartermile wide lake 
the investigation will be passed to the mono county district 
attorneys office and the state department of social services the 
report said 
sheriffs investigator john rutkowski said he was trying to 
determine whether the teenagers were properly supervised 
convict lake just south of the mammoth ski resort about 250 
miles north of los angeles got its name from a shootout between a 
posse and escaped convicts in the late 1800s

defense secretary dick cheney assured japanese 
officials today that no us combat troops would be removed from 
japan if reductions in american military forces here are ordered a 
pentagon spokesman said 
the pledge came as cheney met for more than two hours with his 
japanese counterpart defense minister juro matsumoto according to 
cheney spokesman pete williams 
cheney also met with prime minister toshiki kaifu 
congratulating him on his conservative partys reelection victory 
in sundays election and separately with foreign minister taro 
nakayama 
cheney was in japan on the final leg of his twoweek asian tour 
in which he has been consulting with allied nations about pentagon 
proposals to reduce the 120000 us troops stationed in the 
pacific rim by 10 to 12 percent that would amount to a possible 
cut of 5000 military personnel from japan alone 
about 50000 us marines sailors soldiers and air force 
personnel are based in japan and okinawa 
cheney did discuss numbers about a possible troop withdrawal 
with matsumoto williams said but he provided no details 
the pentagon chief told his japanese counterpart that if we do 
reduce our forces in the region it will be done without affecting 
our combat capabilities williams said 
assuring matsumoto the united states remains committed to 
helping maintain peace in the pacific cheney said america will 
continue to modernize and upgrade the forces and military 
hardware based in the region 
cheney is due to report to congress by april 1 with a 
reassessment of the us military role in the pacific some 
lawmakers have called for severe drawdowns in troops levels based 
in economically robust nations overseas given the reduced 
superpower tensions and budget deficit worries at home 
cheney told the japanese that no final decision has been made on 
manpower cuts nor which units in japan might be affected such 
decisions will be made by adm huntington hardisty the us 
commander in chief of the pacific and us military commanders in 
japan in consultation with the allies williams said 
williams said the two officials had a very broad discussion 
about a possible increase in japanese financial support for 
americans based here but no figures no specifics were 
mentioned 
us officials have said in the past that cheney is looking for 
a sizeable increase in the 24 billion the japanese contribute 
to the 7 billion cost of maintaining us forces here 
the lack of specifics about numbers is a negotiating tactic one 
us official said noting that the japanese understand our 
requirements and are willing to increase their financial support 
for such things as recreational facilities and hospitals to help 
us troops and their families 
in south korea and asia the americans are looking to the host 
governments to pick up more of the tab for such things as utility 
costs and local wages for their own citizens working on the bases 
earlier in cheneys travels one us official said a doubling 
of host nations contributions would be a desirable goal 
because this is cheneys first visit to the region as defense 
secretary the sessions were primarily getacquainted talks 
with each side laying out for the other their global views in light 
of the revolutionary changes that have swept eastern europe and the 
soviet union williams said 
the officials found that they shared very similar views 
williams said both taking a very cautious approach to events 
in the soviet union 
both sides expressed the view that whatever changes may be 
going on in eastern europe and the soviet union the fundamental 
picture in asia and the pacific hasnt changed nor should either 
countrys strategy in the region change williams said 
later foreign minister nakayama told cheney it was important to 
continue enhancing usjapan cooperation said a foreign ministry 
official briefing reporters on condition of anonymity 
nakayama said japan hopes the united states will remain a 
pacific power and keep forwarddeployed forces in the region 
despite the possible cuts according to the official 
the official said kaifu told cheney that japan was willing to 
work closely with the united states on ensuring cuts would not 
affect basic combat strength 
regarding japans share of the cost of maintaining us troops 
kaifu said japan had already substantially increased its share and 
would build in the future the official said 
cheney has stressed throughout his travels that despite some 
reductions in the soviet navy it still retains its largest fleet 
in the pacific and has more than 500000 troops based in asia and 
in spite of soviet moves to lessen tensions with the west nations 
such as south korea still feel threatened by such militaristic 
powers as communist north korea 
cheney delivers a major policy speech on friday before the 
national press club here and then travels to kyoto as a guest of 
the japanese defense agency 
he returns to washington on sunday

east german officials today disputed a report 
that former spymaster markus wolf fled east germany for moscow 
saying he was only taking a vacation in the soviet union and was 
not under investigation for illegal arms deals 
the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper of munich reported that wolf 
had taken refuge in the soviet union to avoid possible arrest in 
connection with a weapons scandal that occurred under the ousted 
hardline communist regime 
wolf who led east germanys espionage operations for 20 years 
is believed to have had close ties to the kgb and once called the 
soviet union his second home 
the official east german news agency adn said wolf and his 
family went on vacation in the soviet union on feb 12 and would 
return soon 
eberhard meier a personal assistant to wolf told the news 
agency the former spy was also working on the russianlanguage 
version of a book published after his retirement from the 
intelligence service 
meier denied that wolf fled to the soviet union to avoid 
possible prosecution in connection with an arms exporting operation 
hansjuergen joseph east germanys chief prosecutor was quoted 
by west german newspaper bild as saying there is no 
investigation against markus wolf 
bild quoted gregor gysi chairman of the former communist party 
as saying wolf was expected back next week the party is now 
renamed the party of democratic socialism 
gysi called everything else in the sueddeutsche zeitung report 
pure nonsense 
the munich newspaper reported that east german prosecutors 
believe wolf was involved in the illegal arms operation and may 
even have directed it 
east german authorities have said the exports were handled by 
alexander schalckgolodkowski chief foreign trader for the ousted 
communist government 
he fled to west berlin when the operation was discovered in 
december and spent several days in jail but a judge said there 
were no grounds in west germany for holding schalckgolodkowski and 
released him in january 
wolf 67 retired in february 1987 from the state security 
ministry where he was in charge of the espionage section and 
directed such agents as guenter guillaume whose unmasking led to 
the resignation of willy brandt as west german chancellor in 1974 
guillaume had been one of brandts closest aides 
in the october turmoil that brought down hardline communist 
party chief erich honecker he supported the type of political and 
economic reforms championed by mikhail s gorbachev the soviet 
president 
wolf joined the state security ministry in 1951 became 
espionage chief in 1957 and retired with the rank of general 
his career was said to have inspired spy novelist john le 
carres character karla a fictional soviet spymaster who finally 
is forced to defect to the west by an elaborate plot devised by 
british agent george smiley 
after decades of virtual invisibility wolf spoke at rallies in 
the early days of east germanys peaceful street revolution and 
appeared in several discussions on east and west german tv 
there is an arrest warrant out for him in west germany because 
of his espionage activities

in water and power demanded the resignation of conservative 
president felix houphouetboigny 
the ivorian league of human rights appealed today to judges to 
intercede on behalf of 23 students it said were detained monday 
night 
trucks of police and soldiers patrolled residential areas and 
shopping centers surrounding the state university 
it was the most serious unrest in years in ivory coast where 
the prowestern government is struggling against a recession that 
brought unemployment salary cuts and declining living standards to 
one of africas richest countries 
houphouetboigny officially stated as 84 years old but believed 
in his 90s has ruled ivory coast as a oneparty state since its 
independence from france in 1960 
students said many of protesters were hurt in protests this week 
but only a few seriously enough to warrant treatment at the 
hospital hospital officials said they were not authorized to 
comment 
on monday night police beat students who set two cars ablaze 
outside a university residence in the poor suburb of yopougon 
three miles from the main campus protesters said one student was 
beaten to death monday night but it was not possible to verify the 
claim 
on tuesday students smashed windows of two buses after bus 
service was suspended between the main campus and the many 
university residences sprawled across abidjan the capital 
today more than 300 students protested peacefully outside the 
rectors office at the university singing greetings land of 
hope the national anthem police charged them with truncheons 
earlier some students tried to attend classes but were 
disturbed by about 20 militant students demanding come out come 
out

students trying to study not all the students are protesting 
but we all agree that there have to be changes in ivory coast a 
chemistry student said 
he said there are no apparent leaders among the 20000 students 
because the government prevents students from forming independent 
groups 
among demands the protesters presented wednesday to rector toure 
bakary is dissolution of a students union that serves as a youth 
league of the ruling democratic party on wednesday the students 
tore up the red green and orange party flag that flew over the 
university

federal aviation officials said today they 
would issue new warnings to airlines and controllers about the 
proper words to use in dealing with a plane that is running out of 
gas 
the federal aviation administration responded to urgent 
recommendations wednesday from the national transportation safety 
board in its investigation of the avianca crash that killed 73 
people in new york last month 
avianca pilots told controllers four times that they were 
running out of fuel before their jetliner crashed but the ntsb 
said that wasnt enough they should have declared a fuel 
emergency the safety board said 
pilots of the colombian airliner apparently tried to tell 
controllers of an emergency situation but failed to use the 
language required by the faa the board said 
faa spokesman fred farrar said the agency would pass along the 
safety boards concerns to all carriers and to its air traffic 
controllers 
well implement the recommendations as soon as possible he 
said 
the board asked the faa to notify all airliners using us skies 
that their pilots must be thoroughly knowledgeable about 
required communications when fuel emergencies and other critical 
problems occur 
the fourmember board with one dissenting vote also urged the 
faa to advise its own controllers of the need to request from 
flight crews clarification of unclear or ambiguous transmissions 
that convey a possible emergency 
board member jim burnett said he did not sign on to the 
recommendations because language in a letter to faa administrator 
james busey was toned down to be less critical of faa controllers 
the letter said the board was still investigating the crash and 
has not concluded that any specific communication or coordination 
problems caused the accident 
it said however that flight 52 pilots should have declared a 
fuel emergency and air controllers should have asked them to 
clarify their condition when they repeatedly said they were 
running out of fuel the board said 
although transcripts of the flight recorder have not been made 
public the letter to busey provided some details of the avianca 
pilots appeals to controllers who were handling their flight the 
boeing 707 airliner was delayed three different times for a total 
of 77 minutes because of heavy traffic over the east coast 
the letter said the crew used nonstandard phraseology in 
telling controllers that the plane was low on fuel among 
statements quoted were well try once again were running out 
of fuel we just running out of fuel and we just lost two 
engines and we need priority please 
fifty minutes before the crash avianca pilots told one 
controller they could only hold about five minutes and two 
minutes later they said they could not make it to an alternative 
airport boston because the jetliner will run out of fuel now 
the last question from the controller just before the crash was 
you have ah you have enough fuel to make it to the airport 
the board said there was no response from the flight crew 
faa rules call for pilots to declare minimum fuel status 
when they need to land without undue delay and a fuel emergency 
when they should be given first priority for landing the next step 
would be a mayday call in the event of a distress condition 
none of the declarations was heard from avianca 52 before it 
crashed 
the board said it was investigating three other incidents 
involving problems in communications since the avianca crash two 
of these involved us carriers and the third involved a foreign 
carrier officials said 
the board said preliminary evidence in its investigation which 
is to be concluded in several months indicates there may have been 
incomplete communication between the flight crew and 
controllers at the new york air route traffic control center the 
new york tracon control center and the kennedy tower 
the board quoted one air traffic controller whose identity was 
not disclosed as saying that had the flight crew advised that they 
were fuel critical with minimum fuel or in an emergency 
situation he would have provided them with emergency service 
the faa is not required to follow safety board recommendations

pasadena police tracked statechartered 
helicopters spraying medflykilling pesticide today and ordered 
them to halt under a law that provides criminal penalties to 
challenge the urban cropdusting 
the helicopter squadron was tracked within city air space flying 
at 500 feet a day after pasadenas governing board adopted a 
minimum altitude of 700 feet for nighttime helicopter formations 
said city director rick cole 
police contacted the helicopter group and issued a 1 am 
warning followed by an order to cease and desist the overflight 
aimed at mediterranean fruit flies said pasadena police officer 
pat carnighan 
the measure enacted early wednesday provides maximum penalties 
of 1000 and a year in jail 
pasadena police in their two helicopters did not write 
citations but when the choppers landed at el monte airport for 
refueling this morning jim josephson the lead pilot for san 
joaquin helicopters was told the city would seek criminal 
misdemeanor complaints carnighan said 
the state hired el montebased san joaquin helicopters to carry 
out its malathion spraying program 
the los angeles county district attorneys office will have 
final say over whether complaints might be filed 
police met with josephson before the overnight spraying to 
discuss the new ordinance and their planned enforcement action 
said pasadena police sgt tom oldfield 
i wouldnt want to make it like this was a play arranged for 
everybodys benefit but we have gone down to talk to them and 
we know what theyre going to do and how theyre going to do it 
and they know what were going to do oldfield said 
its not like were dealing with criminals he said 
the helicopters lifted off late wednesday to spray a 
53squaremile area with the pesticide as part of the states 30 
million medfly eradication campaign 
the area sprayed in the operation that ended about 3 am today 
included 10 square miles in southeast pasadena a city of about 
135000 people 
it also part or all of rosemead san gabriel monrovia monterey 
park south san gabriel northern montebello south el monte el 
monte norwood village parts of alhambra temple city arcadia and 
san marino 
the white bell 204 helicopters flying in formation resembled a 
nighttime military assault 
pasadenas ban was the most aggressive of local efforts to halt 
spraying of malathion other cities have gone to court in hopes of 
doing the same opponents say too little is known about the health 
effects of the insecticide 
however the ban faces an uphill battle because gov george 
deukmejian has declared a state of emergency in response to the 
mediterranean fruit fly and the declaration supersedes local 
ordinances said dr isi siddiqui assistant director of the state 
department of food and agriculture 
if pasadena wants to stop it theyll have to use available 
legal processes siddiqui said they should exhaust legal 
remedies instead of this showdown in the air 
oldfield acknowledged that the swarm of state helicopters 
joined by city helicopters and probably by news helicopters as 
well pose a potentially hazardous situation in the air 
but he said the citys brand of aerial warfare was expected to 
serve as another route to court 
the state is spraying 400 square miles of los angeles and orange 
counties to wipe out the worst infestation of mediterranean fruit 
flies since 198182 
agriculture officials have called the spraying a safe and 
necessary step to prevent the medfly from harming the states 
multibilliondollar farm economy the medfly lays its eggs in more 
than 250 varieties of fruits vegetables and nuts grown in 
california the crops are destroyed when the larvae hatch and 
growing maggots eat their way out 
the los angeles city council voted unanimously tuesday to take 
the state to court over spraying the cities of pasadena glendale 
and burbank will join the lawsuit the los angeles city attorney 
was expected to file the suit today 
last month the orange county cities of garden grove huntington 
beach and westminster filed suit in superior court a judge refused 
their request to stop spraying immediately 
the legal aid society of orange county filed suit in federal 
court arguing the spraying violates the civil rights of homeless 
people 
public concerns about pesticides in california also have 
prompted campaigns to put voter initiatives on the november ballot 
regulating their use a proposed measure backed by 
environmentalists would phase out the use of some chemicals linked 
to cancer a counterproposal from agriculture groups would give 
farmers more flexibility

leaders of the leftleaning labor party said 
today they will quit the coalition cabinet unless the rightwing 
likud bloc accepts a compromise plan to clear the way for 
preliminary peace talks with palestinians 
labor party members said they wanted a cabinet vote on the plan 
in two weeks 
defense minister yitzhak rabin the no 2 official in the labor 
party had been a staunch defender of retaining the coalition but 
said today he changed his mind after egypt approved a compromise 
package on the makeup of a palestinian delegation to the proposed 
talks 
reasonable answers were given by the egyptians to the united 
states on everything that is linked to the composition of the 
palestinian delegation rabin said in an interview with israel 
army radio 
if it becomes clear that the answers from the other arab 
side are positive and if the delay comes from here there 
is doubt whether there is a point in the continuation of the 
government said rabin 
egypt represents palestinian positions in usbrokered middle 
east peace efforts because israel refuses to negotiate directly 
with the palestine liberation organization 
the 107member labor bureau which runs the partys daytoday 
affairs met today to vote on a resolution calling for a cabinet 
decision by march 7 on the compromise that would require 
acceptance from likud which has opposed the compromise 
the compromise calls for the palestinian delegation to include 
six residents of the occupied lands two deportees brought back 
from exile and two residents of israeliannexed arab east 
jerusalem who have other homes in the territories egypt would 
announce the composition of the delegation 
the compromise which has us backing is intended to satisfy 
plo demands while recognizing israels formal insistence that it 
will only negotiate with residents of the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip 
environment minister ronnie milo a confidant of prime minister 
yitzhak shamir today reiterated likuds opposition to the 
compromise package 
deportees and east jerusalem arabs this is something that is 
not included in the initiative of the israeli government milo 
said on army radio 
the governments initiative calls for palestinian elections 
leading to limited selfrule in the west bank and gaza strip with 
their final status to be decided in later talks 
shamir has rejected the participation of east jerusalem 
palestinians but has not ruled out including deportees in a 
palestinian delegation 
labors ultimatum increases pressure on shamir who is battling 
hardline likud rebels trying to oust him as party leader 
the hardliners object to deportees or east jerusalem arabs 
taking part in the talks israel annexed arab east jerusalem after 
it was captured from jordan along with the west bank in the 1967 
middle east war

president fw de klerk today 
welcomed an african national congress proposal to send a delegation 
for talks but criticized the groups adherence to guerrilla 
violence 
the anc which de klerk legalized feb 2 says its armed 
struggle remains a strategy to pressure the whitedominated 
government to share power with the nations black majority of 28 
million 
last week the anc announced it would send a delegation from its 
exile headquarters in zambia to confer with de klerk on how to 
clear the way for negotiations on a new constitution 
no date for the meeting has been set and de klerk said the 
government would first have to address legal uncertainties in 
regard to exiled anc leaders who might be liable for prosecution in 
south africa 
although welcoming the ancs decision to pursue talks de klerk 
said it was disappointing that the anc leadership continues to 
talk about an armed struggle and hostilities at a time when most 
south africans supported by the rest of the world want peace 
the south african government is committed to a new 
dispensation which offers peace and justice for all de klerk 
said an armed struggle and hostilities do not fit into this 
pattern 
recently released anc leader nelson mandela helped launch the 
ancs guerrilla campaign in 1961 a year after the group was 
outlawed the bombing and sabotage campaign however has been 
largely ineffective in the past year and poses no serious threat to 
the government 
de klerk criticized the anc for setting preconditions for the 
start of formal negotiations the anc has said de klerk must lift 
the state of emergency and release all political prisoners before 
formal talks can begin 
de klerk says he plans to lift the 3yearold state of 
emergency soon and already has freed some political prisoners 
the anc seeks a oneman onevote democracy which de klerk 
opposes saying it will lead to black domination of the countrys 5 
million whites de klerk envisions some mechanism that would give 
whites veto power on major policy decisions

two elementary schools were closed after 
officials stumbled onto potentially explosive medical supplies that 
could have blown a hole the size of a decentsized swimming 
pool if they were mishandled 
my wifes scared to death because were living right here 
said dennis jarrell who has three children at gasport elementary 
school across the street from his house 
emergency hospital kits that were equipped with oxygen nitrous 
oxide and ether in the late 1950s and early 1960s were discovered 
in the gasport school and one in nearby middleport by officials 
looking to create more storage space 
theres no set way to compare but you can probably compare 
a container of ether to a stick of dynamite said fire chief 
doug winner there were at least a dozen containers in the gasport 
school 
a federal environmental protection agency official today was to 
inspect the basement storage room where officials stumbled across 
the material monday it was not immediately clear whether the 
original cache of chemicals was intact 
michael shanley head of niagara countys emergency management 
office said all ether in the countys schools had been removed in 
1974 and none could be left in gasport or middleport 
but gary brader royaltonhartland school superintendent said 
there was no record that ether had been removed from either school 
he said the cases containing the emergency medical supplies did not 
appear to have been opened 
the portable operating rooms which were stored in many public 
buildings during the beginning of the cold war were established by 
the federal department of health education and welfare now known 
as the department of health and human services 
the emergency medical facilities were to serve as a civilian 
version of a mobile army surgical hospital or mash unit to be 
available in case of a national emergency said bill clark 
regional director for the state emergency management office 
a directive issued by the federal office of disaster 
preparedness in 1974 warned county emergency agencies about the 
danger of dated ether and ordered the packaged disaster 
hospitals be removed 
niagara county in western new york near the canadian border had 
seven such hospitals according to clark five were dismantled 
for some reason these two werent he said 
while no ones sure exactly how much of the material is stored 
in the two schools gasport fire chief doug winner said theres 
enough so that if it exploded you could probably make a 
decentsized swimming pool 
brader said the school district had been trying to have 
emergency officials remove the supplies from the school for years 
simply because we felt we needed space for storage 
brader said it wasnt until winner toured the basement storage 
room monday that he found out the material probably would have 
exploded had it been moved 
were not dealing with canisters sitting in a shelf where 
youd walk in and see them he said were talking about large 
boxes and wooden crates that are sealed that have signs from the 
fbi saying theyre not be touched 
brader closed school for the 500 gasport pupils monday another 
470 pupils at the middleport school five miles east were sent 
home tuesday after officials learned of a similar portable hospital 
in that buildings basement 
if the schools cant be reopened by next week brader said the 
district will set up double sessions at a nearby high school 
officials said an area up to a halfmile around the schools 
might have to be cleared as a precaution meaning several hundred 
people might be displaced

a federal judge declared unconstitutional a law 
passed by congress to prohibit flag desecration ruling that 
americans right to burn their flag must be protected as 
energetically as their right to wave it 
prosecutors said the challenge to the flag protection act of 
1989 may be appealed directly to the us supreme court 
in dismissing flag burning charges against four people us 
district judge barbara rothstein on wednesday ruled that the new 
federal law is unconstitutional 
in order for the flag to endure as a symbol of freedom in this 
nation we must protect with equal vigor the right to destroy it 
and the right to wave it she said 
mark haggerty jennifer campbell darius strong and carlos garza 
were charged with burning a us flag outside a seattle post office 
shortly after midnight on oct 28 the day the flag protection law 
went into effect 
after the ruling strong set a flag on fire on the steps of the 
us courthouse and spat on it as it burned 
he released a statement with garza and campbell that called 
the ruling a real victory for righteous people everywhere 
the case is the first constitutional challenge to the law 
according to david cole of the center for constitutional rights in 
new york which represented the four defendants 
assistant us attorney mark bartlett said the us attorneys 
office the department of justice and the solicitor general will 
decide whether to appeal directly to the supreme court an avenue 
provided for in the law or to try the four demonstrators on 
another charge 
the center planned to argue the same issue today in a district 
court in washington dc in a case involving three people who 
burned flags on the steps of the capitol cole said 
he predicted both cases would end up before the supreme court 
congress passed the new law after the supreme court last june 
overturned a texas flagburning conviction against gregory lee 
johnson johnson who burned a flag at the 1984 republican national 
convention was among the spectators at a feb 14 hearing before 
rothstein 
rothstein cited the johnson case in her decision saying it 
supported the conclusion that congress is outlawing certain forms 
of expression under the flag protection act 
the principle underlying the supreme courts decision last 
summer was that the government cant compel people under penalty of 
imprisonment to be patriotic and rothsteins decision recognizes 
that congress new law does exactly that said cole who called 
the decision wonderful 
the legislation prohibiting flag desecration was pushed by 
democratic congressional leadership in opposition to a republican 
plan for a constitutional amendment 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said in 
washington today i wouldnt get too worked up about a district 
court ruling its what we all exprected the only significance 
to the ruling he added is getting it the issue in a posture 
where it now will go directly to the supreme court 
the four defendants had pleaded innocent and moved to have the 
flag desecration charges dismissed on grounds the act violates the 
first amendment 
each of the four also was charged with one count of destruction 
of us government property as the demonstration escalated from 
the burning of small paper flags to burning a flag on the post 
office flagpole rothstein was asked only to dismiss the 
desecration charges and that is what she did in holding the law 
unconstitutional 
the flag desecration and destruction of property counts each 
carry a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a 100000 fine 
prosecutors were meeting to decide whether to take the remaining 
count of property destruction to trial or take the issue directly 
to the supreme court

the nations airline industry is asking the 
federal aviation administration to require that all infants be 
fastened into approved safety seats when they fly aboard airliners 
the air transport association which represents major carriers 
was filing a petition today urging the faa to adopt new rules 
affecting children under 2 years old said ata spokesman steve 
hayes the law currently allows infants to be held in the arms of 
adult passengers 
a rule requiring the seats would mean that infant passengers 
would have to be ticketed they currently fly free and most 
airlines allow safety seats to be used if empty seats are 
available most car safety seats are also approved for airline use 
the ata previously recommended the use of safety seats for 
passengers under 2 years old but until today did not favor a 
federal rule requiring such use

alaska could lose federal aid for cleaning 
up the states oilfouled shores if it refuses to accept a plea 
bargain with exxon corp the states top prosecutor said 
attorney general douglas baily said he doesnt like the pending 
plea bargain over criminal charges for environmental damage from 
the nations largest oil spill 
but if alaska declines to be a party to the agreement he said 
it could find itself stuck with the cleanup bills 
at a briefing for state senators wednesday baily said the state 
also could lose control over any federal money that is spent 
the us justice department has refused to inform the state of 
all the points contained in the agreement making a decision 
extremely difficult he said 
i feel the state is being overrun by the federal government 
said sen bettye fahrenkamp of fairbanks i feel that somewhere 
along the line we have to roar even when were getting hit over the 
head 
justice department and exxon attorneys are expected to file the 
plea bargain in federal court friday according to baily today was 
the deadline for the state to accept or reject it baily was to 
make his recommendation today to gov steve cowper 
the state has worked with justice department lawyers on the case 
over the past five months baily said but he said he doesnt know 
if the states suggestions have been followed 
meanwhile the coast guard and exxon announced that the oil 
company will resume its cleanup of prince william sound and the 
gulf of alaska on may 1 weather permitting exxon suspended its 
cleanup in september for the winter and had not set a date for 
further work 
the extent of the work will not be determined until april 
spokesman joe tucker said adding it would be substantially 
smaller than efforts last year 
the company found serious problems along about 10 of the 90 
miles of shore its crews surveyed said hann jahns an exxon 
scientist 
the march 24 spill occurred when the exxon valdez ran aground on 
a reef in prince william sound the tanker leaked nearly 11 million 
gallons of crude oil in the clear waters of the sound killing 
countless birds and other wildlife 
no criminal charges have been filed against exxon in federal 
court the state had decided early in the legal process to 
concentrate on civil litigation and allow the federal government to 
handle criminal charges against exxon 
justice spokeswoman amy casner said negotiations were under way 
but provided no details on the settlement which could resolve 
criminal charges against the company 
exxon spokesman les rogers in houston also declined to comment 
the wall street journal reported a week ago that exxons plea 
bargain included a 500 million fund for cleanup and restoration 
expenses 
the account was criticized by an attorney designated by state 
and federal courts to help direct the dozens of civil lawsuits 
filed against exxon and alyeska pipeline service co 
attorney kenneth adams of washington dc said it would allow 
exxon to say hey we already paid for the damage to natural 
resources and possibly use it as an excuse to avoid civil 
penalties 
adams said he plans to seek court postponement of any plea 
bargain until parties in the civil cases are allowed a chance to 
study it 
baily said however he believed the plea bargain would not take 
away any rights from the state or other civil litigants seeking 
damages from exxon

the soviet union announced today it will not allow 
direct air flights to israel bowing to arab concerns that some 
soviet jewish emigrants might be settled in the israelioccupied 
territories 
the decision followed weeks of campaigning by arab countries 
against the direct flights despite israeli claims that it has no 
policy of settling soviet jews in the occupied lands 
foreign ministry spokesman vadim p perfiliev told a news 
briefing we do not exclude completely the development of 
relations with israel including international flights but we 
think a direct air link presupposes a certain level and character 
of relations between the ussr and israel 
and at present it is completely out of the question to have 
such an air bridge an air link in order to take emigrants to 
israel perfiliev said 
the soviet union broke diplomatic relations with israel after 
the 1967 arabisraeli war in which israel seized the west bank and 
gaza strip moscow has made israels withdrawal from the 
territories a condition for restoring ties 
but the soviet staterun airline aeroflot began negotiations 
last year with israels el al airlines for direct flights between 
tel aviv and moscow they signed an agreement that would have 
started the flights jan 1 
the soviets came under pressure from arab countries and 
palestinian groups concerned about possible settlement of emigrants 
in the occupied lands us officials said tuesday they learned of 
the soviet ban on direct flights during secretary of state james a 
baker iiis talks with soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze in moscow in early february 
asked why the soviets began negotiations on direct flights to 
israel in the first place perfiliev told reporters it is 
difficult for me to answer questions that should be answered by the 
representative of aeroflot many soviet organizations have an 
independent character for their international relations 
he hinted that recent developments soured the soviets on the 
deal 
the issue of mass resettlement in the occupied territories was 
raised quite recently the spokesman said 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir caused widespread concern 
last month when he suggested israel needs to keep the west bank and 
gaza to handle the influx of soviet jews 
the continued ban on direct flights will hinder soviet efforts 
to transport the emigrants who are leaving in record numbers under 
relaxed rules 
last year a record 60000 jews left the soviet union and the 
high rate of departure has continued in 1990 
only about 200 out of the 12000 soviet jews who went to israel 
last year decided to settle in the occupied lands according to 
israeli figures 
the top political adviser to plo chief yasser arafat said any 
settlement of soviet jews in the israelioccupied territories would 
be an act of war that would require reprisals 
bassam abu sharif told reporters on wednesday at the plo 
headquarters in tunis this is very dangerous we will continue 
to work in favor of peace but if no concrete measure is taken by 
the big powers we must think of means allowing us to defend our 
land

a top israeli army officer said in military 
court today troops often ignored orders barring the beating of 
palestinian detainees and that he once slapped an arab whose hands 
and feet were bound israel radio reported 
lt col ephraim fein former commander of the elite givati 
brigade testified in the trial of four givati reserve soldiers 
accused of brutally beating two palestinian detainees in the 
occupied gaza strip in february 1988 one detainee later died 
during todays hearing a defense attorney also cited previous 
testimony saying that gen yitzhak mordechai then army chief in 
the gaza strip beat a palestinian who refused orders to clear a 
stone roadblock mordechai is now head of the armys central 
command which includes the occupied west bank 
the testimony came a day after the release of a us state 
department report saying israeli soldiers often ignored regulations 
and that many unjust killings by soldiers went unpunished 
also today six palestinian teenagers were wounded by army 
gunfire in scattered clashes in the gaza strip arab hospital 
officials said the army said it was checking the reports 
the army declared curfews in villages across the west bank to 
prevent violence on the 21st anniversary of the founding of the 
democratic front of the liberation of palestine a syrianbacked 
radical plo faction israel radio reported 
the givati trial revived debate in israel over the armys 
beating policy beatings became widespread after defense minister 
yitzhak rabin in january 1988 authorized soldiers to beat 
palestinians during violent demonstrations 
the four defendants allegedly beat palestinians severely in a 
grove in gazas bureij refugee camp one of the men iyad akal 21 
fell unconscious and later died in gaza hospital 
fein who testified for the prosecution told the court that at 
the time his soldiers were in a situation close to war the 
orders were changed and eroded to keep up with the fast pace of 
events 
fein also recalled an incident in which he himself violated 
orders 
when they soldiers arrested an arab they bound his hands 
and feet and blindfolded him one soldier helped him get down from 
the jeep and he spit at the soldier i slapped the arab in an 
instinctive reaction the radio quoted fein as saying

secretary of state james a baker iii today 
set stiffer conditions for normalizing relations with nicaragua if 
the leftist sandinistas win sundays elections 
baker told the house foreign affairs committee that the bush 
administration will not automatically accept the judgments of 
international observers as to whether the elections are free and 
fair 
if that condition is met he said there will be no 
normalization until we see a substantial period of good 
behavior by the government including a halt to support for 
leftist rebels in neighboring el salvador and political freedom for 
the opposition in nicaragua 
it seems to me that if you believe in democracy you believe 
in respecting the results of a free and fair election baker said 
in response to a question from rep gerry studds dmass 
but the united states must reserve the right to make the 
judgment whether the election is free and fair he added 
observer groups like one sent by the united nations and one led 
by former president carter will assess the elections in good faith 
and arrive at reasoned judgments he said but in light of 
experience the united states needs to make its own judgment 
he reminded the panel that a large delegation of congressional 
observers that had been appointed by president bush was denied 
visas at the time the nicaraguan government argued that any 
official us group could not be objective since the united states 
is providing money to the election campaign of opposition coalition 
candidate violeta chamorro 
some of the members of that group are traveling to nicaragua 
this weekend as members of other observer teams 
if sandinista president daniel ortega is reelected and we 
shouldnt assume this baker said before we talk about 
normalizing relations we must see a sustained period of good 
behavior by the government 
the government of the united states must be satisfied that 
there will continue to be open political space in nicaragua he 
said then we can consider beginning to look at how we might 
normalize relations including lifting trade sanctions

former president reagan testified in a 
videotaped deposition released today that he never had any 
inkling that white house aides were secretly helping arm and 
advise the nicaraguan contras at a time when congress had banned 
such aid 
and he said no one has proven to me that profits from 
secret arms sales to iran were diverted to the rebels fighting the 
leftist sandinista government in nicaragua 
reagan testified as a defense witness in the forthcoming 
irancontra trial of former national security adviser john m 
poindexter us district judge harold greene allowed the former 
president to give a videotaped deposition in los angeles last 
friday and saturday but barred reporters from attending 
a transcript of that testimony was released today after bush 
administration officials said it did not pose any national security 
problems 
reagan said he assured everybody that we would have to abide 
by the law during the congressional ban on contra aid 
asked if he had any idea that a poindexter aide oliver north 
was giving the contras military advice and logistical support 
reagan said 
i guess that i had never had any inkling that we were 
guiding their strategy in any way 
that statement came under crossexamination by irancontra 
prosecutor dan webb 
poindexter is scheduled to go to trial march 5 on charges of 
obstructing congressional inquiries into the sale of us arms to 
iran and covert administration support for the nicaraguan rebels 
reagan also testified under oath that he never authorized 
poindexter to obstruct congressional inquiries into the irancontra 
affair or to destroy documents 
the former president said repeatedly under crossexamination by 
webb that poindexter never told reagan that he planned to lie to 
congress or to destroy documents sought by irancontra probers 
at any time did john poindexter ever tell you that he had in 
fact obstructed or impeded any congressional committee inquiry into 
events relating to the irancontra affair webb asked 
no reagan replied 
at any time did he ever tell you that he had actually 
destroyed any records or documents related to the irancontra 
affair webb replied 
no the former president said 
reagan said he was never told that north had destroyed 
irancontra documents an act for which the former national 
security council aide was convicted of a felony last year 
asked about his dealings with north reagan said i didnt 
ever have any extensive contact with him i heard about him a great 
deal and reports on him and so forth 
reagan acknowledged that he supported the solicitation of 
donations from foreign governments and others who could help 
finance the contra effort 
although the law banned direct us military aid to the rebels 
reagan said there wasnt any restriction on informing others 
as to how they could help things of that kind and that i did 
approve 
reagan also testified that i wasnt aware that money was 
being diverted from the iran arms sales to the contras 
i was only aware finally that we got our 12milliontwo 
reagan said referring to the money the us government received 
for providing weapons to iran 
may i simply point out that i had no knowledge then or now 
that there had been a diversion and i never used the term the 
former president said and all i knew was that there was some 
money that came from some place in another account and that the 
appearance was that it might have been part of the negotiated 
sale 
webb asked to the extent that there was in fact a diversion 
of proceeds did you in any way approve or authorize that while you 
were president of the united states 
for heavens sake no reagan replied and when i was once 
asked about that extra money and said if it was an added sum to the 
purchase price what would i do i said i would have given it 
back 
the former president added no one has proven to me that there 
was a diversion 
to this day all i know is that some sum of money over and 
above the 122 million purchase price appeared in a swiss bank 
account in which it was said that account had been used on another 
occasions sic to provide help to the contras reagan said 
and to this day i still with all of the investigations that 
have been made i still have never been given one iota of evidence 
as to who collected the price who delivered the final delivery of 
the weapons whether there was ever more money in that swiss 
account that had been diverted someplace else 
i am still waiting to find those things out and have never 
found them out reagan said 
poindexter is charged with conspiracy two counts of obstructing 
congress and two counts of making false statements in connection 
with the irancontra affair 
specifically he is accused of covering up from congress norths 
secret assistance to the contras and knowledge by government 
officials of a 1985 shipment of hawk missiles to iran 
poindexters lawyers sought reagans testimony in an attempt to 
show that the president approved of his national security advisers 
activities 
judge greene ordered the release of a transcript of reagans 
eight hours of testimony but barred the news media from making 
copies of the videotape for broadcast 
in his order greene rejected arguments by poindexter and reagan 
for delaying the release of the testimony 
the press and the public were not admitted to the deposition 
itself but in view of the requirement of openness of crimnal 
proceedings this segment of the poindexter criminal trial should 
not be kept secret the judge said the public is entitled to 
know now to what the former president testified 
on wednesday the justice department said it would not seek to 
delete any portions of the reagan tapes indicating they did 
contain any sensitive or classified information 
the governments refusal to allow the disclosure of certain 
information led to the dismissal of some major conspiracy charges 
against poindexter and his codefendants in the irancontra affair 
reagans lawyers on tuesday urged the court not to give news 
organizations copies of the tapes proposing instead that a 
transcript be made available at the end of the trial reagans 
lawyers said the public should be allowed to view the tape but not 
copy it 
in a supporting brief the justice department said it believes 
that access to a former presidents testimony should be no greater 
than the access to the testimony of other witnesses 
twelve news organizations have petitioned the court for release 
of the videotapes as soon as possible poindexters lawyers have 
asked greene to postpone releasing the tape until a jury is picked 
arguing that broadcast of the tape would jeopardize the defendants 
right to a fair trial

the senate judiciary committee today approved 
the nomination of clarence thomas the conservative chairman of the 
equal employment opportunity commission to be a federal appeals 
court judge 
the nomination was approved 121 with sen howard m metzenbaum 
dohio voting against it it now goes to the full senate 
some civil rights forces had opposed the nomination because of 
thomas opposition to affirmative action programs and his other 
conservative views but the national association for the 
advancement of colored people announced two weeks ago that it would 
not stand in the way of confirmation 
thomas one of the most visible blacks in the republican 
administrations of former president reagan and president george 
bush was nominated to the us circuit court of appeals in the 
district of columbia 
at his confirmation hearing last week thomas said state and 
local agencies were primarily to blame for more than 900 cases of 
alleged job discrimination lapsing without action 
critics from womens and senior citizens groups said the number 
of lapsed cases actually ran into the thousands metzenbaum said 
the responsibility rested with the commission itself 
i was flabbergasted that he did not know that state agencies 
are under contract to process state age discrimination claims 
metzenbaum said 
sen edward m kennedy dmass said that he and thomas 
disagree about certain aspects of civil rights policy and that 
he is concerned about the commissions failure to ensure that age 
discrimination claims were investigated within the statute of 
limitations 
but kennedy said a court of appeals judge neither makes 
policy nor presides over an administrative agency he added that 
thomas has the ability to serve with distinction on the court of 
appeals and i support his confirmation 
if confirmed thomas would take the place of robert bork on the 
appeals court because it is located in the nations capital it 
frequently is called on to decide major governmental cases and it 
has often been a springboard to the us supreme court 
bork resigned after his nomination to the supreme court was 
rejected by the senate in the most bitter judicial fight of recent 
years 
thomas born in poverty in rural georgia is a graduate of yale 
law school he worked for sen john c danforth rmo both in 
danforths senate office and when he was missouri attorney general 
thomas was recommended to the panel at his confirmation hearing 
by danforth and by sens sam nunn dga and charles robb dva

the bush administration today challenged 
congress to help american businesses compete in world markets by 
passing enacting a law limiting their legal liability for their 
products 
if we are serious about addressing our nations 
competitiveness we must address the excessive burdens placed on 
american business by our current liability system said wendell 
wilkie ii general counsel for the commerce department 
wilkies comments came as the senate commerce consumer 
subcommittee today considered the first nationwide product 
liability law which in past years has failed to win committee 
approval 
wilkie said a federal law would make the rules for doing 
business clear consistent uniform and predictable and reduce 
transaction costs related to liability lawsuits involving 
potentially dangerous products 
transaction costs are attorneys fees and other court costs 
associated with product liability lawsuits 
a 1988 survey of business administrators by the conference 
board an organization of business executives showed that 40 
percent of us businesses said product liability had a major 
impact on their operations added wilkie 
but sen ernest hollings dsc chairman of the commerce 
committee armed with a recent report by the general accounting 
office disputed wilkies claims 
hollings said the study by congress investigative arm showed 
most punitive damages awards are overturned on appeal by businesses 
of product liability cases 
this goes to the heart of transaction costs said hollings 
the participants in todays hearing skirted the linkage of the 
administrations backing of the bill with the debate over blocking 
development of new birth control products including the french 
abortion pill 
a leading consumer advocate contends administration officials 
in arguing for such a law are citing a government study that 
criticizes legislative and regulatory obstacles to us production 
of ru486 the socalled abortion pill 
but david beckwith spokesman for vice president dan quayle 
said wednesday the council for competitiveness which quayle heads 
took no position on whether existing laws create obstacles to 
the production of ru486 in this country 
president bush called product liability standards a legislative 
priority in his state of the union address the administration 
contends the current patchwork of statebystate laws stifles new 
product development harms us competitiveness encourages 
excessive litigation and inflates insurance costs 
beckwith said a council member raised the report by the national 
research council and the institute of medicine during a meeting 
last week with consumer advocates 
the report concluded no us manufacturer will enter the market 
to produce ru486 the socalled abortion pill or other new 
birth control products unless liability laws are changed to reduce 
the manufacturers risk of being sued 
the only way the birth control issue came up was in reference 
to newspaper articles that mention the various regulatory 
delays discussing publicity about the product liability problem 
said beckwith 
however linda lipsen legislative counsel for consumers union 
a national consumer advisory organization said the 
administration which has done everything to prevent the 
manufacture of abortioncausing drugs is bemoaning the fact that 
liability concerns have stifled manufacturers from producing these 
kinds of drugs 
the proponents of this legislation point to this one study as 
some kind of proof that innovation is stifled because of product 
liability she said 
consumers union opposes the bill contending it creates 
unnecessary obstacles to victim compensation 
the justification for this legislation changes as trends 
change said pam gilbert legislative director for public 
citizen a consumer advocacy group founded by ralph nader 
another opponent of the legislation arthur bryant executive 
director of trial lawyers for public justice said the only way 
that product development will not be affected by liability concerns 
is to pass a law establishing that no compensation would be 
paid 
administration and business proponents of a uniform federal 
product liability law say the current senate proposal would not 
limit damages 
the bill introduced by sen robert kasten rwis would 
create a uniform standard for imposing punitive damages in product 
liability litigation allow separate legal proceedings to consider 
punitive damages from product liability and compensatory damages 
set a twoyear statute of limitations on liability claims and 
allow companies to pay damages in proportion to their 
responsibility for harm 
we just want to level the playing field said victor 
schwartz an attorney and leading lobbyist for businesses that want 
to change the liability law no one knows what rules apply to 
them and their products 
opponents argue the proposal would give consumers the burden of 
determining the proportion of liability for manufacturers 
distributors or wholesalers of goods and they charge the federal 
government would be usurping states rights to set up their own 
product liability systems 
in fact senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
recently warned that product liability legislation would lead to 
federal regulation of the insurance industry

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan said 
today that while he was surprised by certain aspects of januarys 
sharp jump in consumer prices he was not worried that inflationary 
pressures were accelerating 
greenspan appearing to present the central banks semiannual 
report to congress was questioned at length about his views on 
inflation in light of wednesdays government report that consumer 
prices shot up by 11 percent in january the biggest monthly 
increase in seven years 
the january increase translated into an annual rate of 141 
percent 
sen don riegle chairman of the senate banking committee asked 
greenspan whether such a sharp jump in prices would force the fed 
to change its new forecast that consumer prices will rise by 
between 4 percent and 45 percent this year slightly lower than 
last years 46 percent increase 
greenspan said that he felt comfortable with the feds forecast 
although he conceded that some of the specific components of the 
january price surge were surprising 
as best as we can judge while the rate of inflation is higher 
than we would like there is no evidence that it is accelerating 
greenspan said while i did not like the statistic published 
wednesday it did not give me any great concern greenspan said 
in his prepared testimony greenspan repeated comments he made 
on tuesday that he believed a reversal in the sharp january jump in 
prices was under way he cited evidence showing that price 
increases in the last half of 1989 were appreciably lower than 
in the first six months of the year 
in his testimony today greenspan said the fed expects the 
economy to be sluggish this year growing at an anemic rate of 175 
percent to 2 percent that would be the weakest performance since 
1984 and far below the administrations expectations for the year 
economists believe the slow growth is part of the central banks 
plan to wring inflationary pressures out of the economy for this 
reason they believe the central bank will not move to lower 
interest rates anytime soon preferring to keep rates high to 
discourage borrowing and thus dampen economic demand 
while the january price increases were indeed frightening to 
economists some viewed the increase as a temporary weatherrelated 
phenomenon others saw more entrenched inflationary pressures 
prices at the wholesale level shot up 18 percent last month a 
pace which translates into an annual rate of 241 percent 
consumer inflation did little better rising 11 percent in 
january the steepest onemonth gain since june of 1982 the 
government reported wednesday 
much of the gain in both price measures was attributed to a 
spurt in energy and food costs brought on by the severe december 
weather which depleted fuel stocks and damaged fresh fruits and 
vegetables 
but even discounting the volatile food and energy categories 
the socalled core rate of inflation climbed at an alarming 06 
percent in january that was highest increase in a year and one 
which would translate into an annual rate of 75 percent 
the core rate of inflation is considered a better gauge of 
underlying inflation pressures januarys 06 percent increase was 
worrisome enough to attract attention at the white house which 
termed the increase disappointing news 
we do expect the core rate of inflation to decline steadily 
over the year presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said in a 
statement we are hopeful that this is a bulge that will be 
temporary in nature but inflation requires eternal vigilance and 
we remain on a policy of wanting steady growth with low inflation 
fitzwater who recently criticized the fed for its refusal to 
lower interest rates refused to say what course the fed should 
pursue now saying ill let the fed worry about interest rates 
some analysts agreed with the bush administrations assessment 
that inflation should ease in coming months and cautioned the fed 
against overreacting to one months numbers 
the surge in prices should not be viewed as an acceleration in 
the underlying rate of inflation but rather as a onetime increase 
in food and energy said gordon richards chief economist of 
the national association of manufacturers 
but other economists said they were worried that labor costs 
especially in the booming service sector were beginning to move 
upward 
inflation is disturbingly high said allen sinai chief 
economist of the boston co this indicates an entrenched 
inflation that will not easily recede 
john silvia an economist with kemper financial services said 
it was difficult to discount the january increase because so many 
service categories from medical care to entertainment costs were up 
one could try to explain it as a temporary blip but there were 
a lot of increases outside of food and energy he said 
greenspan says inflation is a concern and he is right

the soviet union suggested today that 
nato and the warsaw pact limit their number of troops in central 
europe to 750000 each an east german negotiator said 
the superpowers have agreed to a ceiling of 195000 troops each 
for the united states and soviet union in central europe 
the agreement reached at meetings among nato and wasaw pact 
foreign ministers in ottawa canada is to be part of a final 
accord on reducing troops tanks artillery and other nonnuclar 
arms in europe negotiators hope to reach agreement on the accord 
before the end of this year 
the new proposal combined with east bloc nations plans to cut 
their own armed forces would lead to nato having more manpower in 
the region than the warsaw pact said east germanys chief delegate 
at arms talks klausdieter ernst 
ernst said the seven warsaw pact countries would have a total 
troop strength in central europe of 600000 to 700000 troops 
while the west would have a total of some 1 million troops 
that situation is totally unsatisfactory ernst said 
western sources appeared to contest ernsts estimate saying 
nato currently has about 900000 troops in central europe which 
covers west germany east germany the netherlands belgium 
luxembourg czechoslovakia poland hungary and denmark 
in the wake of democratic reforms in eastern europe and their 
growing independence from moscow hungary and czechoslovakia have 
begun negotiations with the kremlin on a total withdrawal of soviet 
troops from their territories those talks are separate from the 
ongoing vienna talks 
the soviet idea was presented at the last vienna plenary before 
a threeweek recess but it was not put on the table as a formal 
proposal 
ernst said that the overall ceiling suggested by the soviets 
would include domestic troops as well as those stationed on foreign 
soil 
in separate negotiations the hungarians are seeking withdrawal 
of the approximately 50000 soviet troops stationed on their 
territory while czechoslovakia seeks the total removal of 73500 
soviet troops from its soil 
poland hungary and czechoslovakia have also announced troop 
cuts of their own 
both east and west also presented new proposals in an effort to 
narrow differences on definitions of certain armaments and treaty 
language for verification of any troop withdrawals 
west germanys chief delegate ruediger hartmann presented two 
working papers on behalf of nato on information exchanges and 
conditions for inspections as part of a verification program 
ernst said he presented on behalf of the warsaw pact a paper on 
tank definitions 
definitions of weapons categories have been a major sticking 
point at the negotiations which began last march the sides also 
disagree on the number of combat aircrat each side should have 
lots of work remains to be done here us chief delegate 
r james woolsey told reporters

aflcio leaders today urged unions to 
renew support for striking machinists at eastern airlines and 
declared that the nearly yearlong strike remains as solid as 
ever 
leaders of the 141 millionmember federation set to adjourn 
their winter meeting later in the day issued a statement saying 
the 8500 machinists had inspired workers nationwide by being on 
the front lines of labors battle against corporate greed and 
intransigence 
machinists who walked out last march have faced stiff odds with 
a bush administration that doesnt care about the survival of 
eastern airlines and has sided with management in the matter the 
federation said 
eastern was the only major point of contention when union 
leaders met with labor secretary elizabeth dole earlier in the week 
aflcio president lane kirkland has conceded that so far the 
strike has failed but said easterns parent texas air corp has 
not won either 
labor leaders also acknowledged they still lack enough votes in 
congress to override president bushs veto of legislation that 
would create a commission to settle the dispute 
the eastern situation has been a sore spot for labor leaders 
this week who otherwise have been buoyed by signs that organized 
labor may be recovering from a bleak decade 
the machinists strike marks a strong contrast to labors recent 
successes by pittston coal miners and nynex telephone workers in 
the northeast 
just today the federations executive council received a report 
by the roper organization showing that more americans instinctively 
side with unions than with companies in labor disputes 
weve been tempered i think by a period of fire and in the 
net result its strengthened us kirkland said 
the pollsters found in their most recent tracking surveys that 
33 percent instinctively side with the union while 25 percent favor 
the company when they first hear of a strike and before they know 
any of the details 
that was the highest level of support for unions and the lowest 
for companies recorded by the company since it posed the question 
to sample groups 12 years ago 
roper reports are sponsored by the aflcio and 40 other 
organizations including government agencies the company conducts 
facetoface interviews with new groups of 2000 adults every five 
weeks 
union leaders were cheered by the results given the decline in 
stature organized labor suffered in the 1980s with losses in 
membership 
also serving as a rallying point for labor leaders this week was 
the success of the appalachian coal strike pittston miners who 
won on key bargaining points ended their bitter 10month strike 
tuesday by ratifying a new contract 
united mine workers president richard trumka who last year 
brought his union back into the aflcio and others said the public 
looks more favorably on unions because unions have avoided 
focusing so narrowly on shop floor issues 
there are 38 million americans without health care whats the 
only group thats really fighting for health care thats organized 
labor trumka said 
the roper report showed that in 1981 60 percent of americans 
thought unreasonable demands by labor unions made the cost of 
living go up unneccesarily that number has now dropped to 40 
percent the survey showed 
noting the decline of bluecollar jobs in the manufacturing 
area the report said the image of unions had gained in the eyes of 
professional and white collar workers groups that formerly were 
the least likely to support organized labor 
aflcio leaders who have traditionally taken a hardline 
approach to the soviet union called on the bush administration 
wednesday to give the country most favored nation status which 
would let them benefit from lower trade tariffs

an iranian newspaper close to president 
hashemi rafsanjani said thursday all 18 western hostages in lebanon 
should be freed because they have become a propaganda tool for 
irans enemies 
most of the captives are believed held by kidnappers loyal to 
iran 
regardless of the wests propaganda ploys moslem forces out 
of islamic and humanitarian considerations should work to get the 
hostages free with no precondition the englishlanguage tehran 
times said in an editorial parts of which were carried by irans 
official islamic republic news agency 
it was the first known statement by an iranian newspaper in 
support of freeing all the hostages whose fate is believed linked 
to a power struggle within the iranian government 
eight americans four britons an irishman an italian two west 
germans and two swiss citizens are captives in lebanon 
terry a anderson 42 has been held the longest he is chief 
middle east correspondent of the associated press and was abducted 
march 16 1985 
andersons sister peggy say was in damascus syria on 
thursday as part of a tour with an associated press delegation to 
seek the hostages release 
among leaders with whom she has met are javier perez de cuellar 
the un secretarygeneral pope john paul ii and yasser arafat 
chairman of the palestine liberation organization attempts to see 
iranian leaders have failed 
asked in damascus about the tehran times editorial mrs say 
said i am deeply grateful it is encouraging i consider that 
iran is not part of the problem but part of the solution 
arafat told mrs say in their meeting last week that rafsanjani 
had the greatest influence with the kidnappers but hardliners in 
the iranian government limited his room for maneuver 
in its editorial the tehran times said the struggle against 
western influence in the middle east was legitimate and should 
continue but that all forces in lebanon should work to free 
hostages of whatever nationality 
they should regard the hostages as victims of imperialist 
policies of the west and make attempts to get them all freed it 
said maybe 1990 will be the year for the release of all the 
hostages 
it repeated rafsanjanis demand for the release of irans charge 
daffaires in beirut mohsen musavi and three other embassy staff 
members kidnapped in north lebanon in july 1982 by members of the 
lebanese forces a christian militia all four are believed dead 
lebanese forces commander samir geagea said in august 1988 he 
found no trace of the men after taking over the militia in 1986 
geagea blamed his predecessor elie hobeika for their 
disappearance and apparent murder 
rafsanjani has offered to help free the western hostages 
in august 1989 he said there were reasonable prudent 
solutions to the problem two months later rafsanjani said he 
would not try to get them released unless the united states freed 
billions of dollars in iranian assets frozen in 1979 
any statement with even a hint of conciliation is condemned 
promptly by factions in the iranian government who reject the 
reconciliation with the west favored by rafsanjani 
ali akbar mohtashemi the former interior minister and 
rafsanjanis main rival regularly encourages groups holding 
hostages in lebanon he said in a newspaper interview last month 
they have a natural right to take hostages to inflict heavy blows 
on their enemies 
most of the kidnappers are believed linked to hezbollah or 
party of god a lebanese fundamentalist shiite moslem group 
mohtashemi helped organize in the early 1980s

the space agency today postponed 
launch of shuttle atlantis on a secret military mission until at 
least saturday as doctors treat an astronauts cold and 
forecasters worry about the weather 
the launch had been scheduled for today until the space agency 
decided wednesday to postpone it after commander john o creighton 
suddenly developed a sore throat and head congestion originally 
the launch was postponed to friday morning this morning creighton 
was described as feeling better but the launch was put off at least 
one more day 
the commander is doing a lot better nasa spokeswoman lisa 
malone theyre going to give him another day and theres also 
the weather 
nasa said the launch was delayed for at least 24 hours that 
would put liftoff in the early morning hours of saturday although 
forecasters say the weather is unlikely to clear until sunday 
a statement late this morning said creighton showed some 
improvement overnight but remains under assessment 
nasa spokesman kyle herring said creighton was examined by a 
nasa flight physician on wednesday morning and was treated with 
antibiotics 
he does not have a fever said the spokesman it could be 
an indication of a cold coming on 
even without the astronauts illness the chances were uncertain 
that atlantis could have been launched today or friday air force 
experts forecast a 50 percent chance today and an 80 percent chance 
friday of prohibitive clouds rain and wind 
because atlantis cargo is a secret spy satellite nasa has not 
announced a precise launch time saying only that a launch on 
friday would come between midnight and 4 am the countdown is kept 
secret until the final nine minutes before the rockets ignite but 
sources who asked not to be named said the liftoff will come 
about 1 am 
after launch information about the mission is to be blacked out 
until an hour before atlantis returns to earth the mission is 
expected to last four days and end with a landing at edwards air 
force base in california 
all five of atlantis crew members were found to be healthy 
during a routine medical examination on tuesday 
it was only the second time a mission had been postponed because 
of illness in 1969 the apollo 9 mission to orbit the earth and 
test the lunar landing module was delayed three days after the 
three crew members got sick 
the following year astronaut thomas k mattingly was taken off 
the crew of apollo 13 a moon mission when doctors learned he had 
been exposed to the measles he was replaced on the crew by backup 
pilot john swigert but the launch was not delayed 
nasa officials said there were no plans to replace creighton 
a space shuttle launch postponement at this point in the 
countdown costs the kennedy space center about 247000 in labor 
and materials this figure does not include expenses at other nasa 
centers that also support the mission 
nasas announcement came about two hours before workers were to 
start pumping more than half a million gallons of propellant into 
atlantis fuel tank pumping the fuel would have added 377000 to 
the delay cost 
according to sources who asked not to be named atlantis cargo 
is a 37300pound 500 million spy satellite called afp731 it is 
said to be capable of taking highresolution reconnaissance photos 
and also eavesdrop on electronic communications around the world 
sources said the satellite is to be placed into a high 
inclination orbit that will cover more of the earth than satellites 
previously launched by the shuttle this orbital path will carry it 
over most of the soviet union including areas far to the north 
atlantis flight will be 34th space shuttle mission and the 
sixth secret military mission

an explosion ripped through a 
usflagged petroleum tanker in the persian gulf today leaving 
two americans missing and setting off fires that forced the rest of 
the crew to abandon ship the navy said 
a us frigate patrolling nearby rescued 23 crew members from 
the sea and some were injured said capt ron wildermuth chief 
spokesman for the navys central command in florida two of the 
injured were airlifted to a hospital in dubai 
one of the rescued men said all 25 crewmen on the surf city a 
kuwaiti tanker flying the us flag were americans but this was 
not immediately confirmed 
the cause of the explosion was not known initial reports 
indicated it was an accident said wildermuth 
in washington pentagon spokesman bob hall said there were 
indications the explosion was internal he did not elaborate 
crewman wayne cohen said the blast occurred about 1100 am 
while crew members were working on a cargo tank on the ship which 
was loaded with millions of gallons of highly volatile products 
it was a huge explosion the whole ship just blew up said 
cohen 27 of boston who was cut by glass and airlifted to a 
hospital in dubai 
the glass in the bridge blew out there was some panic and we 
all made our way to the lifeboat he said cohen said he saw 
nothing but fire and smoke as he looked back at the tanker from 
the lifeboat 
the 81283ton surf city carried 178 million gallons of naphtha 
and 89 million gallons of gasoil industry sources said us navy 
units and the united arab emirates coast guard put out four blazes 
but a fifth continued to burn more than six hours after the blast 
and ships nearby moved away for fear of another explosion 
the ship is halfsunk now and it might sink totally said a 
member of the dubai coast guard 
shipping sources said on condition of anonymity the tanker had 
been loaded in kuwait and was on its way out of the gulf the ship 
was off the coast of the united arab emirates near the iranian 
island of abu musa when the explosion occurred 
abu musa was a stronghold of iranian revolutionary guards and 
was used as a base to attack ships at the height of the iraniraq 
war there have been no attacks on shipping in the gulf since iran 
and iraq signed a ceasefire agreement in august 1988 
wildermuth said the uss simpson was 15 miles away from the surf 
city at the time of the accident and rushed to its aid the uss 
dewey a missile destroyer was also in the vicinity and joined the 
rescue operation along with united arab emirates vessels he said 
the shipping sources said the simpson one of about 10 us navy 
ships in the gulf was escorting the surf city at the time of the 
accident 
the navy said direct escorts of kuwaiti tankers by american 
warships stopped after the ceasefire and that us warships now 
monitor americanflagged ships in the gulf from a distance 
kuwait put 11 of its tankers under the us flag in 1987 to 
receive us navy protection from iran which was concentrating 
attacks on kuwaitiflagged vessels in retaliation for kuwaiti aid 
to iraq 
kuwait last year reached agreement with the united states to 
revert six of the 11 tankers to kuwaiti registry surf city was one 
of the five remaining usflagged tankers expected to revert to 
the kuwaiti flag this month 
us maritime law requires that all crew members of us flagged 
ships be us citizens but an exception was made at the time of 
the reflagging in 1987 
cohen said all the crew of the surf city were americans he 
identified another crewmen airlifted to the same dubai hospital as 
earl washington a boatswain no other details on the injured were 
immediately available 
the central command in florida which oversees the navy force in 
the gulf said it was told at least one of the ships crewmen was 
britishcanadian

civil rights veterans who for decades have 
carried the rev martin luther kings banner of nonviolence are 
uneasy over nelson mandelas refusal to renounce violence but are 
reluctant to criticize the south african 
for colleagues and followers of king the release of mandela 
this month after 27 years in prison has posed something of a moral 
dilemma 
as longtime opponents of apartheid they are joyful over 
mandelas freedom but the refusal by mandela and the african 
national congress to rule out the use of arms is at odds with the 
nonviolent philosophy espoused by king 
followers of king however say they believe the slain civil 
rights leader if alive today would not condemn mandela for his 
position 
we still subscribe to nonviolence but we dont believe we 
have a right to dictate to other people how to achieve their 
liberation said the rev joseph lowery president of the 
kingfounded southern christian leadership conference 
while i personally choose other tactics i grant them the 
right to choose how to get the heels off of their necks 
david j garrow a pulitzer prizewinning biographer of king 
said thursday that supporting mandela is less of a problem for 
kings followers than it would have been for king himself 
theres no getting around the fact that kings belief in 
nonviolence was so total and central that he could not have 
endorsed the tactical position of the anc said garrow an 
associate professor of political science at city college of new 
york 
but i think the totality of kings commitment to nonviolence 
was relatively unusual even within the southern christian 
leadership conference he said i dont necessarily think 
theres any contradiction or alteration involved for a lot of 
people to say they happily endorse mandela and the anc 
those who worked closely with king said they would prefer using 
the principles of nonviolence preached by king to overcome 
apartheid but they said they can understand because of the 
violence suffered by blacks in south africa why mandela feels he 
cannot rule out violence in selfdefense 
we had this argument in the early stages of the civil rights 
movement said kings widow coretta scott king we worked with 
people who told martin if they hit me ill hit back 
he told them if they were going to join the movement 
theyd have to be nonviolent mrs king said in an interview 
last week many people in the marches were not nonviolent but 
became nonviolent as time went on 
mrs king said her husband didnt condemn those who disagreed 
with him but tried through his own actions to demonstrate the 
effectiveness of nonviolence 
lowery said king unequivocally opposed violence but still was 
supportive of the african national congress before his 
assassination in 1968 the associations violence posed him a 
moral problem and a theological problem lowery said but i 
dont know that he ever condemned the anc 
king frequently spoke out against south africas racial 
segregation he advocated worldwide economic sanctions against 
south africa to destroy apartheid 
in a 1964 speech on south africa however king said we can 
understand how in that situation people felt so desperate that they 
turned to other methods such as sabotage 
lowery stressed that mandela has endorsed only defensive 
violence not aggressive force 
the rev hosea williams a former atlanta city councilman who 
was kings field general in the peak days of the civil rights 
movement said he disagrees with the use of violence in south 
africa but would not withdraw his support for the antiapartheid 
effort 
mandela is advocating protective violence which is much 
different from dr kings total nonviolence advocacy williams 
said we never found anything more effective than nonviolence 
williams said the refusal of blacks to resort to violence even 
after the beatings suffered by demonstrators in alabama in 1965 
drew sympathy from the public and provided support to force federal 
civil rights legislation 
the use of violence by the anc williams suggested could 
jeopardize such popular support for the antiapartheid movement 
id plead with mr mandela to give up on any sort of violence 
and resort totally to nonviolence but i certainly could not 
withdraw my support for the black struggle in south africa 
williams said

a tv movie about the challenger disaster 
has upset and offended those closest to christa mcauliffe the new 
hampshire schoolteacher who died in the shuttle explosion 
among the critics are mcauliffes mother grace corrigan and 
concord mayor james mackay who said the film reduced him to tears 
mrs corrigan and mckay said the movie failed to capture 
mcauliffes personality 
mrs corrigan of framingham mass said at first it was 
difficult to watch a screening of challenger which will air 
sunday on abc 
it started to upset me then i said no im not going to let 
it because it is only a video she said in a telephone interview 
this week 
mrs corrigan whose husband edward died this year and was 
buried four years to the day after the jan 28 1986 challenger 
explosion said actress karen allen failed in her attempt to 
portray mcauliffe 
i didnt feel it was christa but i didnt think it would 
be she said 
mackay complained that the movie invaded the mcauliffe familys 
privacy and also said allens portrayal of the former teacher in 
no way caught the depth of mcauliffes personality 
mackay said the film conjured up painful images of the 
illfated 73second flight and was difficult for him to watch 
the whole thing was very emotional to me mackay said i 
started to cry at several points 
mcauliffe a concord high school social studies teacher who was 
the first private citizen chosen to fly in space died with six 
other crew members 
bob hohler a reporter for the boston globe and author of i 
touch the future the story of christa mcauliffe said he thought 
the movie was pretty bad 
it just was a pretty powerful moment in history reduced to a 
dull docudrama its real superficial hohler said it cheapens 
history when it becomes so superficial 
writerproducer george englund said he knew there would be mixed 
reactions to the film but defended it as sensitive in almost 
every aspect 
nasa officials said the agency has taken no formal position on 
the movie but two spokesmen said they believe sentiment at nasa 
uns against the film 
its the sort of thing that basically we think is probably too 
soon to be done said hugh harris deputy director of public 
affairs at the kennedy space center in cape canaveral fla 
if i were guessing people who were not involved at nasa will 
find it a very touching film but there will be some people at nasa 
who feel it cuts close to the bone said bill sheehan nasa 
associate administrator for communication in washington 
englund said any movie about the disaster was bound to cause 
debate 
i can understand why some people would think its too soon 
he said but i dont know if there ever would have been a 
consensus about the time

scores of riot police some carrying 
revolvers stood guard outside a hospital thursday to prevent a 
rally in memory of people killed in a fledgling prodemocracy 
movement 
the government said 12 people have been killed since sunday 
government spokesman radhey shyam bista said the latest victim 
died of injures sutained tuesday when police fired on rioters in 
jadukuha 100 miles southeast of katmandu 
opposition sources say the official death toll is far too low 
and that nearly twice that many people have died since the nepali 
congress party and a leftwing coalition began agitating to end the 
29yearold ban on political parties 
most victims have been killed by police gunfire and some of the 
injured estimated at more than 50 have been brought to bir 
hospital in the capital katmandu 
policemen carrying batons and some with revolvers blocked 
traffic around the hospital thursday and asked pedestrians to leave 
the area forcing organizers to cancel the memorial rally 
we couldnt hold our program because of the police said a 
member of the leftwing coalition contacted by telephone 
but four small streetcorner meetings were held near the 
hospital said the activist who spoke from an undisclosed location 
and refused to be identified 
police said they had no information on any meetings being held 
the government of king birendra says the campaign to lift the 
ban on political parties runs counter to a 1980 referendum in which 
voters narrowly rejected a return to a multiparty system 
nepals twoyear experiment with a westernstyle democracy ended 
in 1961 when king mahendra the present monarchs father 
dissolved the government of the nepali congress party accusing it 
of corruption and poor administration 
the government accuses the opposition parties of trying to 
impose their version of democracy on a nation that they say already 
has a working democracy

president fw de klerk on 
thursday accepted a proposal by the african national congress to 
send a delegation for the first formal talks between the white 
government and its foremost adversary 
the ancs commitment to dialogue is a positive step 
reflecting a desire to search for solutions through peaceful 
means said de klerk who lifted a 30year ban on the guerrilla 
movement three weeks ago 
de klerk also made his first public statement on a controversy 
involving defense minister magnus malan who has been linked in 
press reports to a secret military unit that allegedly assassinated 
antiapartheid activists 
the president interviewed by the staterun tv network said the 
allegations would be thoroughly investigated by a judicial 
commission criticized the press for conducting a trial by 
media and praised the role of the security forces in saving 
south africa from anarchy and chaos 
opposition political leaders demanded malans resignation and 
urged de klerk to ensure that no coverup takes place 
malan in statements this week denied having ordered 
assassinations but did not rule out the possibility the unit may 
have committed such acts he pledged the military would not 
interfere with any investigations 
the star newspaper of johannesburg quoted sources as saying 
malan had been aware of the unit at least since 1987 
police investigators have said in court papers that members of 
the unit called the civil cooperation bureau are suspected of 
involvement in the assassinations last year of david webster a 
johannesburg human rights activist and anton lubowksi a civil 
rights lawyer and proindependence activist in namibia 
de klerk last month ordered a judicial inquiry into charges that 
military and police squads murdered government opponents the 
commission is expected to investigate the unsolved killings of at 
least 60 activists in the past decade 
three former policemen have confessed to serving on death 
squads several active police officers are under investigation 
the activists allegedly killed by the death squads include 
members and supporters of the anc 
although it was legalized feb 2 as part of de klerks peace 
initiative the anc says its guerrilla campaign remains one of its 
tactics in trying to pressure the government to end whiteminority 
domination 
on feb 16 the anc said from its headquarters in zambia that it 
would send a delegation to south africa to confer with de klerk 
about obstacles in the way of negotiations on a new constitution 
the anc says the state of emergency must be lifted and all 
political prisoners freed before such talks can start its office 
in london released a list thursday of more than 750 prisoners it 
said should be freed 
no date for the preliminary meeting has been set de klerk said 
the government would first have to address legal uncertainties 
regarding exiled anc leaders who might be liable for prosecution in 
south africa 
earlier thursday the government said de klerk had postponed a 
meeting scheduled for saturday in zaire with leaders of some black 
african nations the anc had urged a boycott of the meeting saying 
de klerks reforms had not gone far enough 
while welcoming the ancs decision to pursue talks de klerk 
said it was disappointing that the anc leadership continues to 
talk about an armed struggle and hostilities at a time when most 
south africans supported by the rest of the world want peace 
the government is committed to a new dispensation which offers 
peace and justice for all de klerk said an armed struggle and 
hostilities do no fit into this pattern 
recently freed anc leader nelson mandela helped launch the 
guerrilla campaign in 1961 a year after the group was outlawed 
the bombing and sabotage campaign has been ineffectual in the past 
year and poses little threat to the government 
in the port city of durban leaders of the anc and a more 
conservative rival movement inkatha opened their first 
headtohead peace talks thursday seeking to halt a power struggle 
that has killed more than 3000 people 
anc leader walter sisulu arriving for the closeddoor talks 
said blacks in natal province were preparing themselves for 
peace after three years of savage factional warfare 
mandela is expected to appeal for reconciliation when he 
addresses a mass rally in durban on sunday 
sisulu one of mandelas closest associates joined an anc 
delegation that met black community leaders from around 
pietermaritzburg one of the worsthit areas 
the group then returned to durban to meet an inkatha delegation 
headed by oscar dhlomo secondincommand under zulu politician 
mangosuthu buthelezi 
both groups depict themselves as foes of apartheid but inkatha 
rejects the ancs use of violence and opposes confrontational 
protest tactics the anc favors a socialistoriented economy while 
inkatha favors free enterprise

the familiar figure of ronald reagan flickered 
across television screens in a pair of federal courtrooms thursday 
before one of his smallest audiences ever 
several dozen reporters enough to pack one courtroom at one 
point watched and listened took notes drifted in and out 
the occasion was the first showing of the former presidents 
videotaped testimony taken last weekend and intended for use in 
the irancontra trial of his onetime national security adviser 
john poindexter 
reagan testified about iran and about the nicaraguan contras 
about former aides poindexter and oliver north about weapons and 
about hostages but perhaps most strikingly he testified over and 
over during eight hours of questioning about how much he didnt 
remember 
i dont recall that reagan responded when asked about the 
tower investigative commissions report that north and the national 
security council were involved in aiding the nicaraguan rebels 
when lawyers read him that part of the commission report reagan 
continued to deny recollection saying his interest had been in 
other findings 
he was asked about american contacts with iranian dissidents who 
he had hoped were in a position to form a government to succeed the 
ayatollah khomeini 
i cant recall the dates he said 
when he was hospitalized for cancer did government officials 
come to bethesda naval hospital to inform him of negotiations 
i recall i had visits at the hospital i have to tell you i 
cant recall just what they were all about he responded 
looking relaxed reagan allowed an occasional smile to cross his 
lips and chuckled once when lawyers began arguing about a question 
another time he thanked the judge for interceding during 
questions about his having quoted abraham lincoln through a smile 
reagan remarked that such questions just increase the jokes about 
his age 
but again and again indeed 10 times in one 30minute stretch 
reagan said he didnt recall events 
was he ever told that it would be better to have israel handle 
the delivery of missiles to iran 
no i dont recall that 
did he recall being told that private individuals were involved 
no i dont 
did he know the details of providing spare parts for hawk 
missiles for iran 
i just dont recall 
had he ever discussed with poindexter what to say if the story 
came out 
i dont recall i dont recall that 
did he meet with poindexter between two news conferences in 
november 1986 
i dont recall 
when he met with congressional leaders was poindexter present 
i dont recall 
did he remember when he was informed of the hawk missile 
shipment 
i actually dont i dont recall when i was told or who told 
me 
was that information given to him in geneva when he was 
preparing for a meeting with soviet president gorbachev 
i dont have a clear recollection of what was discussed there 
were so many meetings in so many different places 
in the courtroom of judge harold greene hours of taped 
testimony ground on starting before a packed house that eventually 
dwindled to a handful 
across the hall a couple dozen reporters drifted in an out of 
judge louis oberdorfers courtroom where they were allowed to see

the senate today rejected an attempt to cut 
off debate on a proposed resolution to commemorate an armenian 
genocide a move that signals trouble for supporters of the 
measure 
the resolution which has infuriated turkey and caused bitter 
divisions among republican lawmakers is sponsored by senate 
minority leader bob dole rkan it would designate april 24 as a 
national day of remembrance of the armenian genocide of 
19151923 
by a 4949 vote the senate refused to break a filibuster 
against doles resolution dole needed 60 votes to end the debate 
over three days opponents of the measure led by sen robert 
byrd dwva had filibustered the resolution 
despite doles defeat the measure is not dead in fact dole 
said he would ask for another cloture vote to be held next week 
two republicans took opposite positions on the resolution debate 
today 
sen arlen specter rpa said there is strong evidence 
that armenians were the victims of a genocide 75 years ago 
civilians were sought out and massacred because they were 
armenians he said 
he said he supports the resolution because the united states 
should always stand firm against human rights abuses 
however sen john warner rva the ranking republican on the 
senate armed services committee said the historical facts are not 
completely known moreover he said the united states should not 
fans instability in central europe at a time of great change there 
the alleged massacre of 1 million armenians occurred in the 
ottoman empire before the establishment of the republic of turkey 
turks contend that at most 600000 armenians died and that they 
died of disease famine or attacks by marauding bands during world 
war i 
sen john warner rr 
nuzhet kandemir the turkish ambassador to the united states 
said in a letter to senators that the resolution would constitute 
an unwarranted and deeply offensive insult to his government 
no more serious charges can be levied against a nation he 
said 
after two days of debate on the measure the senate scheduled 
the cloture vote on whether to cut off discussion sixty senators 
must vote to invoke cloture a vote to end the debate would clear 
the way for a yesorno vote on the resolution 
key democrats have joined the bush administration in opposing 
the dole resolution primarily on grounds that it could jeopardize 
usturkey relations turkey a nato ally is home to us 
military bases 
sen robert byrd dwva is the leading opponent of the 
measure and was joined by sen sam nunn dga wednesday in 
speaking against the measure 
although armenians suffered in the past it would be pointless 
to create new problems with the resolution said nunn chairman of 
the senate armed services committee the senate risks making a 
decision that could weaken the southern flank of nato he said 
the resolution may seen remote and academic but it is a 
live issue in turkey said nunn 
turkeys lobbyists have said that countrys government might 
retaliate against the united states with drastic steps possibly 
even refusing to renegotiate rights for military bases 
several of nunns colleagues on the panel joined him in opposing 
the measure including sens ernest hollings dsc dale bumpers 
dark and james exon dneb sen david boren dokla chairman 
of the senate intelligence committee also condemned the measure 
dole has broken with the administration on the resolution 
although president bush said during the 1988 presidential campaign 
that he would be inclined to remember the dead armenians in a 
resolution 
but secretary of state james a baker iii said earlier this 
month it has been the position of prior administrations to 
oppose those resolutions and let history be the judge of that 
unfortunate episode 
dole and white house officials tried earlier to reach a 
compromise on the language in the measure but had little success 
dole has said however he might offer substitute language in the 
form of amendments

prime minister charles haughey said 
thursday he would not support european community membership soon 
for the emerging east bloc democracies but foresaw individual 
agreements with the former communist states 
haughey current president of the ec said signals that the 
united states wanted to establish new ties with the 12nation trade 
bloc reflected its emergence as very near to superpower rank 
politically and economically and as an anchor of stability in a 
rapidly changing europe 
he said the community would make separate association agreements 
with the eastern european nations with the exception of east 
germany as part of a united germany 
the agreement with each country would be a semipermanent 
thing he said it would not be something seen as a step toward 
membership i cant see any major expansion of the community for 
some time to come simply on the basis of size 
asked if the bush administration was more interested in the 
community than in the special relationship with britain haughey 
said definitely quite clearly 
there is a distinct change of emphasis and more likely of 
policy he said 
bush and secretary of state james a baker iii have clearly 
signaled that the united states now wishes to look to the 
community for a full meaningful and acrosstheboard 
relationship he said 
during a twoday visit to washington next week haughey will 
discuss with bush and baker how to set up closer usec links 
bush has urged the community which is to become a single 
barrierfree market in 1992 to accelerate moves toward monetary 
union and closer political ties baker in a speech in berlin in 
december said washington was seeking a closer more formally 
structured relationship 
haughey said an ecus treaty would take too long to organize 
the west european countries have suggested as a preparatory move 
regular meetings between baker and the ec foreign ministers 
haugheys remarks appeared likely to underline what many 
commentators and british opposition parties see as prime minister 
margaret thatchers increasing isolation and dwindling influence 
internationally 
key factors are the prospect of a powerful united germany the 
apparent waning of the usbritish relationship since president 
ronald reagan left office and britains often isolated position in 
the community over issues such as the pace of european union and 
monetary integration 
mrs thatcher also is widely regarded as having come grudgingly 
to accept rapid german unification her government denies this 
attitude 
in the latest confrontation britain on tuesday defied an ec 
decision not to ease sanctions against south africa in response to 
the whiterun governments reforms and decided to drop the 
nonbinding ban unilaterally 
irish newspapers reported prominently thursday that us 
administration officials denied a claim by britain that bush 
supports mrs thatchers policy 
ireland whose bilaterial relations with britain are colored by 
the troubled history of britishrun northern ireland accused the 
thatcher administration of setting a dangerous precedent

a coast guard investigator said today 
he cannot explain why the exxon valdez disappeared from radar and 
then reappeared after is had run aground on bligh reef 
lt cmdr thomas falkenstein confirmed that the coast guard had 
responsibility for monitoring the tanker during its transit into 
prince william sound but also confirmed that the ship was not 
visible on radar some time before its disastrous accident 
coast guard monitors have testified that the ship was visible on 
the radar after its skipper joseph hazelwood radioed that it was 
aground 
if you are asking why it was off radar and secondarily was on 
radar i dont know falkenstein said under questioning by 
hazelwood attorney michael chalos 
the 43yearold hazelwood of huntington ny is charged with 
seconddegree criminal mischief a felony and three misdemeanors 
reckless endangerment operating a vessel while intoxicated and 
negligent discharge of oil 
the officer who was one of the first on board the ship after it 
ran aground said he smelled alcohol on hazelwoods breath and 
immediatetly sent word to shore that someone should be sent to test 
the captains blood alcohol level 
he also testified that federal regulations followed by the coast 
guard required that a vessel going through the valdez narrows into 
prince william sound must be under the direction and control of 
an officer who has been certified as specially trained for that 
area 
hazelwood was the only officer on board with such a 
certification when the accident occurred and he was not on the 
ships bridge 
in testimony wednesday an exxon official said that hazelwood 
indicated the disaster was his fault and he was to blame for the 
nations worst oil spill 
paul myers of danville calif told jurors hazelwood appeared 
to be taking responsiblity as captain of the ship but he was 
prevented from answering a question about whether hazelwood also 
was accepting criminal blame 
hazelwood told him the ship pride of the exxon fleet was 
damaged but safe and said there was oil in the waters of prince 
william sound myers recalled 
he indicated this had happened and it was his fault he was to 
blame myers said he had just gone down to do some paperwork 
when this happened and he should have been on the bridge 
the tanker leaked nearly 11 million gallons of alaska crude oil 
into prince william sound the disaster killed countless birds 
fish and wildlife and blackened hundreds of miles of rocky shore 
nearly a year later it still is being cleaned up 
exxon officials announced wednesday that the company will resume 
its cleanup of the remaining oil may 1 exxon suspended its cleanup 
in september because of the onset of severe winter weather but had 
declined to set a date for further work 
the company found serious problems along about 10 of the 90 
miles of shoreline its crews surveyed said hann jahns an exxon 
scientist 
earlier in the trial hazelwood was quoted as telling a coast 
guard investigator who asked what the ships problem was i think 
youre looking at it a witness said the anguished skipper was 
referring to himself 
another exxon tanker captain on wednesday told jurors for the 
first time that the giant oil company is concerned about the 
outcome of hazelwoods trial michael stalzer said exxon has paid 
for his lawyer and for legal representation of all crew members who 
are testifying in the trial 
i believe exxon does have an interest in the outcome of this 
case he said 
exxon is the defendant in more than 150 civil lawsuits resulting 
from the oil spill but hazelwood is the only defendant charged 
criminally 
stalzer who preceded hazelwood as commander of the exxon valdez 
and replaced him after the accident indicated that hazelood 
violated several sections of a company operating manual in his 
command of the illfated ship 
stalzer said he would not have left the ships bridge during a 
potentially hazardous passage around ice in prince william sound 
hazelwood left the ship in control of the third mate 10 minutes 
before it grounded 
but he said none of the violations was against the law and that 
the exxon bridge manual was merely a guideline and statement of 
company policies on how to run a tanker 
the prosecution seeks to prove that hazelwoods actions were 
reckless and endangered the property and lives of others 
stalzer described the exxon valdez as the newest and probably 
most technically advanced of the tankers in exxons approximately 
30ship fleet 
starting may 1 exxon will resume its cleanup of oil remaining 
in prince william sound and the gulf of alaska from the nations 
largest oil spill company officials said wednesday 
exxon suspended its cleanup in september because of the onset of 
severe winter weather but had declined to set a date for further 
work

thirty tolltakers at the triborough bridge have 
been hit with a mysterious illness during the past week prompting 
authorities to study everything from the air they breathe to the 
coffee they drink 
three workers on thursday became the latest victims of the 
ailment complaining of sore throats headaches or dizziness other 
symptoms that have afflicted workers since the outbreak began feb 
16 include vomiting watery eyes and fainting one worker required 
mouthtomouth resuscitation 
carbon monoxide poisoning was ruled out on wednesday on 
thursday test results showed that tap and bottled water were not 
the problem officials said 
at this point its still a mystery and well just stay with 
it well look at everything under the sun until we can get to the 
bottom of this said tina casey a spokeswoman for the city 
department of environmental protection 
the yshaped bridge spans the east river and connects the new 
york city boroughs of manhattan queens and the bronx it is used 
by 160000 vehicles a day 
barbara richardson a spokeswoman for the triborough bridge and 
tunnel authority said thursdays illnesses marked the first time 
the symptoms had struck someone at the bronx toll plaza all other 
victims had been at the manhattan plaza 
it alsowas the first time the incidents occurred in the morning 
the others were in the evening or afternoon richardson said 
a year ago february two officers were hit by a similar outbreak 
at the bronx toll plaza 
on wednesday devices were installed in each of the selfservice 
lanes to help detect any airborne contaminants 
in addition to using the airmonitoring equipment weve also 
stationed our hazardous material people during rush hour to see if 
we can ever sense anything with our five senses casey said 
you might need a sixth sense to solve it 
boilers incinerators emissions eating habits coffee 
purchased en route to work bacteria levels and drycleaning of 
uniforms are being studied 
also casey said pesticides and paint stored on randalls 
island where the toll plazas converge are being investigated 
along with a parks department garage there a sewage treatment 
plant on adjoining wards island has been checked 
so we havent exhausted all the angles but we have definitely 
begun looking beyond the obvious no matter how illogical or 
obscure casey said

thursday marked the fourth anniversary of the revolt that brought 
corazon aquino to power by demanding her ouster and calling her a 
us puppet who betrayed the rebellion 
about 10000 workers students and slum dwellers rallied in 
central manila and demanded the removal of six us military bases 
in the philippines 
riot police a barbed wire barricade and fire trucks blocked 
about 1000 protesters who tried to march on the presidential 
palace they dispersed after a brief rally 
the revolutionary alliance for the massessoldiers of the 
filipino people a rebel military group said it decried the 
treachery of this government and how readily it has surrendered our 
sovereignty to foreign powers the group spearheaded a december 
coup attempt against mrs aquino 
the protest marked the anniversary of the feb 2225 1986 
civilianbacked military revolt that drove president ferdinand 
marcos into exile in hawaii and installed mrs aquino as president 
the governments main anniversary celebration will be held 
sunday 
leto villar executive vice chairman of the may first movement 
labor federation said thursdays protest was symbolic of a 
deadlock between the workers and the aquino government 
we are handing her a notice of strike villar told the 
demonstrators unless she can show that she would fulfill her 
promises of reforms she cannot rely on the support of the 
progressive forces even if her government faces another coup 
attempt 
under this regime the people continue to wallow in poverty 
and mrs aquino continues to be a us puppet because she needs 
american support said federation spokesman nick elman 
the crowd chanted down with the usaquino regime and 
out with the us bases 
nathaniel santiago chairman of the militant league of filipino 
students said mrs aquino should not fear losing us support in a 
future coup attempt but instead should fear a lack of support 
from her own people 
he referred to air cover provided by jets from the us clark 
air base during the first day of the dec 19 coup attempt that 
turned the tide against the rebellion 
in a statement the rebel soldiers accused the aquino government 
of unparalleled corruption and insatiable appetite for revenge 
the rebels said the aquino government has allowed foreigners to 
dominate the economy and political life in the philippines 
the group whose principal leaders were among those who began 
the 1986 revolt said the administration was appealing abjectly 
for foreign intervention to save it from the wrath of a 
longsuffering populace with legitimate grievance 
the communist new peoples army issued a statement saluting 
filipinos for participating in the people power revolt 
at the same time we are hopeful that people power will again 
be ignited in a revolutionary uprising toward genuine democracy and 
freedom the statement said 
leftists are as opposed to the military rebels as they are to 
aquino they have accused rightwing officers of plotting the 
murder of their own leaders 
the lease on the six us military bases in the philippines 
expires in 1991 and there is growing sentiment in the philippines 
against renewing the contract

the soviet union suggested thursday that 
nato and the warsaw pact limit themselves to 700000 to 750000 
soldiers each in central europe an east german negotiator said 
since the soviets and united states have agreed to 195000 each 
in central europe and east bloc nations are reducing their armies 
the east will have fewer soldiers in the area than the west said 
klausdieter ernst chief east german delegate to talks on reducing 
conventional military forces 
ernst said these factors would result in a maximum of 700000 
soldiers for the seven warsaw pact countries against about 1 
million for the 16member north atlantic treaty organization which 
he called totally unsatisfactory 
western sources said nato now has about 900000 troops in 
central europe to meet the agreed superpower ceilings the united 
states will have to withdraw 60000 soldiers 
the soviet idea came up at the last meeting before a threeweek 
recess in the talks which began in march 1989 but it was not 
presented as a formal proposal 
in washington us arms officials said they were baffled by the 
soviet suggestion which they said was made without prior 
consultation with other warsaw pact nations 
we are so confused we cannot be indignant one said on 
condition his name not be used they could not even get their 
warsaw pact allies to agree to it and the western response was 
this is a nonstarter 
last week the soviet union and united states announced an 
agreement to reduce to 195000 each the number of soldiers 
stationed in an area covering the two germanys belgium 
czechoslovakia denmark hungary luxembourg the netherlands and 
poland 
another 30000 us soldiers will be allowed in britain and 
southern europe to compensate for the great distance between the 
united states and europe 
the agreement reached at a meeting of nato and warsaw pact 
foreign ministers last week in ottawa canada is to be part of a 
final accord on reducing manpower tanks artillery and other 
nonnuclear arms in europe which negotiators hope to conclude this 
year 
ruediger hartmann the chief west german delegate said in his 
statement to the final session the negotiations are now moving at 
a rate commensurate with the rapidity of political processes in 
europe according to a text made available to journalists 
hungary and czechoslovakia are negotiating for total withdrawal 
of soviet troops from their territory they and poland have 
announced reductions in their own armed forces 
about 50000 soviet military personnel are stationed in hungary 
and 75000 in czechoslovakia 
ernst said the overall ceiling suggested by the kremlin would 
include national armies and soviet troops stationed on foreign soil 
both sides presented new proposals thursday aimed at resolving 
definitions of certain armaments and treaty language on 
verification 
hartmann presented two working papers for nato on information 
exchange and conditions for inspections ernst said he presented a 
warsaw pact paper on defining tanks 
definitions of weapons categories has been a major problem in 
the negotiations and the two sides also disagree on the number of 
combat aircraft each side should have 
lots of work remains to be done here the chief us 
delegate r james woolsey told reporters

firefighters trudged through thick 
mud thursday trying to douse the flames on millions of burning 
tires after bad weather grounded three airplanes that had been used 
to fight the 11dayold blaze 
the fire outside hagersville a southeastern ontario city about 
150 miles east of detroit has spewed toxic fumes that forced 
hundreds of nearby residents to flee their homes 
environment ministry spokesman john steele said tests were being 
conducted to determine if oil runoff from the tires could affect 
local water supplies 
weve found oil in the water below the surface but its being 
separated and moved into holding ponds steele said adding that 
it did not appear any oil had seeped more than three feet into the 
ground 
the main water table that serves people in the the area is 
much deeper down said steele 
the fire broke out at the tyre king recyling dump feb 11 the 
site contained 12 million to 14 million discarded tires 
on wednesday officials launched an allout assault on the blaze 
by deploying three planes usually used to fight forest fires 
at the same time ground crews wearing oxygen masks used 
bulldozers and backhoes to separate the tires trying to turn a 
mountain of them into small stacks that could be attacked and 
extinguished 
the planes flew all day between the dump and nearby lake erie 
fetching thousands of gallons of water to dump on the flames along 
with foam 
bad weather thursday grounded the planes leaving the ground 
crew to battle the flames alone about 40 firefighters worked at a 
time on sixhour shifts 
its pretty slow going because of all the mud ralph 
dantonio of the ontario fire marshals office said after a morning 
visit to the tyre king dump because of the rain theres not a 
lot of flames visible but there is smoke 
waste water from the fire has contaminated a local creek and 
some farmers have been warned not to use the water for their 
animals the province is supplying bottled water 
tyre king ontarios largest tire dump was declared an illegal 
waste site in december 1985 by the government 
the environment ministry said last week that ontario taxpayers 
could end up paying an estimated 1 million to clean up the damage 
caused by the fire if straza is unable to pay for it 
some environmental experts have said the fire could burn for 
months the hundreds who have been evacuated from a 2mile radius 
will be eligible for compensation the government has said

undercover police are driving in marked cars and 
some are getting into uniform as authorities try to stem the number 
of killings in this city where 22 people have been slain since the 
beginning of the year 
they dont shoot people in front of marked units were hoping 
the increased visibility will be a deterrent to violent crime 
hopefully that will give them pause and give the neighborhoods a 
greater sense of security said superintendent paul evans who 
heads the police bureau of field services 
as of wednesday 22 people had been shot knifed or beaten to 
death in the same time period last year 14 people were killed in 
all there were 100 homicides in boston in 1989 and 98 in 1988 
all but six of the killings occurred in the neighborhoods of 
dorchester mattapan and roxbury a lower to middleclass area 
inhabited by about 150000 people police spokesman jim jordan said 
thursday 
this week plainclothes police patrolled the most troubled 
sections of the city in 12 additional marked cars some undercover 
officers also donned uniforms before getting behind the wheel 
police would not disclose the total number of cruisers deployed 
evans said the action is a departure for the police after 
police commissioner francis roache took over in 1985 there was an 
increase in the number of specialty units plainclothes police and 
officers patrolling in unmarked cars 
evans credited the use of unmarked cruisers with boosting last 
years arrest rate by 20 percent but he added more arrests does 
not mean less violence 
police believe many of the latest slayings are linked to drugs 
or gangs 
the issue took up most of wednesdays monthly closed meeting of 
the governors anticrime council the boston globe cited 
participants as saying 
state sen paul white who represents dorchester appealed for 
help from the state invoking memories of the tensions during the 
busing crisis of the 1970s white suggested having state and 
metropolitan police assist boston police 
those agencies helped out during busing and i think weve 
reached a crisis stage here white said after the meeting 
response to the deployment of more marked cars was generally 
favorable 
it cant get any worse out there said sgt william 
broderick president of the boston police superior officers 
federation and a critic of the administration the new tactic he 
said is worth a shot 
georgette watson founder of the anticrime program dropadime 
said i think that probably will satisfy the community people to 
see more uniformed police out on the street 
earlier this week deputy police superintendent william 
celester commenting on the numbers of shootings said that if gang 
members could shoot straight there would be even more slayings 
not only are drug dealers killing other drug dealers but they 
also are shooting innocent people celester said 
the latest killings included the shooting of a 15yearold boy 
in a 5 holdup the knifing of a 28yearold man and the shooting 
of an 18yearold found dead in a roxbury home police said

the mighty microbe strikes again 
five fearless astronauts and the worlds very best spacecraft 
were poised this week to rocket into orbit with a spy satellite 
that might be vital to the nations security 
nasa the powerful technological force that conquered the moon 
and sent craft soaring toward distant stars had done everything 
possible to prepare for the cloakanddagger mission an army of 
engineers and technicians had given their best and were standing 
by awaiting the final countdown 
then the microbe came along 
some bug so small that even a microscope might not find it 
had somehow invaded the pristine premises of americas space 
program and struck down one of the nations best 
atlantis commander john o creighton nasa said had developed 
a sore throat and congestion it hurt to swallow and the nose was 
all stuffy 
if he were on television creighton would have been the 
before portrait in some cold medicine commercial if he were a 
6th grader mom would have kept him home 
but creighton is an astronaut about ready to take the controls 
in a 1 billion spacecraft carrying a half billiondollar payload 
and when an astronaut crewman gets sick everybody stays at home 
the mission was postponed twice and wont go now before saturday 
its happened before to nasa in 1969 apollo 9 was delayed for 
three days while the threeman crew recovered from the sniffles 
a year later nasa doctors learned that apollo 13 astronaut 
thomas k mattingly had been exposed to the measles another mean 
little microbe mattingly was removed from the flight and backup 
pilot john swigert was put on board as it turned out the apollo 
13 crew almost died when an oxygen tank exploded and mattingly 
safe at home never developed the measles 
nasa may do technological marvels and accomplish feats of wonder 
in outer space but it still hasnt conquered the mighty microbe 
the agency tries astronauts preparing for a mission are 
isolated for a week before launch nasa posts warnings about the 
isolation and takes pains to make sure that anyone but close family 
wears a mask around the crew members 
during the apollo program the isolation was even stricter a 
nasa doctor caused the cancellation of plans to have president 
nixon have dinner with the apollo 11 astronauts before the launch 
of that first moonlanding mission 
asked two days later if he had been worried about catching a 
cold or something from a presidential dinner apollo 11 astronaut 
mike collins shook his head 
im sure he said deadpan that presidential germs are

between 18 million and 23 million east 
germans will resettle in west germany this decade a study said 
thursday but it did not specifically address how the rush toward 
reunification would affect the trend 
the number of resettlers will depend in large part on the pace 
of political and economic reforms in what is now east germany 
according to the respected diw research institute of west berlin 
while the comprehensive study did not specifically address the 
most recent steps toward unification east germanys economic 
problems are so enormous that the political joining of the two 
countries is unlikely to slow the migration 
the prospects of massive unemployment in what is now east 
germany once freemarket reforms take hold and a higher standard of 
living in the west are likely to keep fueling the exodus 
full integration of the two countries could take several years 
already this year about 100000 east germans reached the west 
severely straining local governments ability to house and provide 
for them more than 340000 east germans made the same trek last 
year 
they have already contributed to a massive housing shortage in 
one of europes most populous countries while many west germans 
have called for curbs on the influx 
many fear that even an expected unification will do little to 
halt the westward flow diw officially called the deutsches 
institut fuer wirtschaftsforschung confirmed some of those fears 
the economics research institute said if comprehensive reforms 
are put into motion quickly and there is hope of creating more 
prosperity the number of people leaving what is now east germany 
will be 18 million by the end of the century 
diw said that situation would lead to an average exodus of 
230000 people a year through 1995 
diw also projected a situation in which the east germans 
perceive the reform process is being delayed in that case 
said the study 23 million people from east germany will resettle 
in the west in the 1990s 
west german businesses already are entering into joint ventures 
in east germany with the agreements calling for massive layoffs to 
make businesses more efficient that and other economic pressures 
are likely to create even further difficulties and drive more 
people out 
many of those leaving are young skilled workers whose talents 
are desperately needed for east germanys faltering economy 
many other problems are also afflicting east germany including 
crumbling housing and staggering pollution problems many of these 
problems will take years to resolve 
east germans arent the only ones heading to the riches of west 
germany an estimated 377000 ethnic germans from other parts of 
eastern europe arrived last year and tens of thousands are 
expected this year 
the diw study said that 13 million ethnic germans would 
resettle in west germany by the end of the decade if reforms in the 
rest of eastern europe proceed at a brisk pace the number would be 
16 million in the event the changes slow down 
west germany has about 624 million people while the population 
of east germany is a little more than 16 million

six nationwide telemarketing firms all based 
in arlington texas have been charged with fraudulent practices 
involving the sale of home water treatment products the government 
said thursday 
investigators raided the telephone boiler rooms of the 
companies a day earlier seized their records and obtained 
temporary court orders freezing their assets and barring them from 
future misrepresentations the federal trade commission said 
the move was the seventh major enforcement action by the ftc 
since 1987 against firms that allegedly have preyed upon consumers 
fears about the safety of their drinking water by marketing 
products under false or misleading claims 
the texas operation was coordinated with the justice department 
the us postal inspection service and the texas attorney generals 
office said barry j cutler director of the ftcs bureau of 
consumer protection 
cutler said the ftc had filed two civil complaints in us 
district court in fort worth seeking refunds to the defendants 
customers and permanent injunctions against fraudulent practices in 
the future 
one complaint was lodged against five firms gtp marketing inc 
telstar marketing network inc hs marketing inc unitel 
marketing consultants inc and mbc group inc all located at the 
same watson road address in arlington three individuals todd 
arnold stephen gregg echols and pat arnold also were named in 
that complaint 
a reporters call to those individuals at the number listed for 
unitel was not immediately returned three of the companies were 
not publicly listed the telephone listed at the fourth hs 
marketing was not answered 
the second complaint was aimed at c amp l industries inc and 
its two officers ramon haas and t w bodiford both were said by 
a secretary to be out of the office and unavailable for comment on 
thursday 
ever since water quality emerged as a consumer concern a 
couple of years ago fraudulent telemarketers and others have 
aggressively promoted their products by using scare tactics 
blatantly false claims about federal endorsements of their 
products and gross exaggerations about their products ability to 
cleanse and purify water cutler said 
they offer lavish awards and prizes and moneyback guarantees 
they will say anything to make a sale he said 
in the case of c amp l which markets the atlantis water 
purification system the firm told prospective customers several 
falsehoods including claims that a bill pending in congress will 
require every home to have a water treatment device and that its 
product had been endorsed by the government and was used on the 
us space shuttle according to the ftc complaint 
cutler said c amp l also claimed that unpure water killed more 
people last year in the united states than cholesterol and nicotine 
combined and that its device marketed for 450500 could 
virtually eliminate such contaminants as lead bacteria radon gas 
acid rain pesticides and industrial runoff from up to 15000 
gallons or more of tap water 
not only will the device not do that he said but you could 
go to the hardware store and get something like it for less than 
100 
the five other firms were charged with luring in customers by 
mailing them postcards claiming they had won valuable awards such 
as a cadillac or 5000 in merchandise checks in fact the awards 
required payment of substantial additional sums of money the 
ftc complaint said and when consumers called in the firms falsely 
claimed they needed their creditcard numbers to verify their 
eligibility and then debited those accounts without 
authorization the complaint charged further that many consumers 
who did order a product such as a water treatment unit never 
received it 
cutler noted that there are many legitimate companies selling 
useful home water treatment devices and consumers who do their 
homework can get their moneys worth

the states highest court thursday reinstated an 
order barring demonstrators from blocking abortion clinics but the 
group operation rescue said it will obey a higher law and 
continue to protest 
the supreme judicial court ruled 41 that the injunction places 
only minimal limitations on protesters and does not threaten their 
first amendment rights 
darroline firlit a spokeswoman for operation rescue which has 
staged several protests at clinics said her antiabortion group 
will continue its activities 
we have an obligation before god to continue to rescue 
firlit said in this case we are obeying a higher law 
dorothy lohmann of planned parenthood of massachusetts said her 
organization was pleased with the decision 
in the future one of the things we are looking for is to have 
bigger fines imposed on those who break the injunction she said 
under the ruling the injunction will remain in place until the 
outcome of a lawsuit filed by planned parenthood and several 
clinics they charge that operation rescue threatened and 
intimidated patients and clinic staff members 
the high courts ruling reverses a single justices decision in 
august to lift an injunction against the protesters the other 
justices reversed justice joseph nolans ruling 
justice francis oconnor dissented arguing that the injunction 
infringes on free speech rights and that the abortionrights groups 
dont represent women claiming direct harm from the protests 
legal challenges to operation rescues tactics around the 
country have left the organization so far in debt that it announced 
jan 31 that it was closing its national office in binghamton ny 
the group is appealing a 50000 judgment in a new york lawsuit 
by the national organization for women however it won a case in 
federal court in los angeles where a judge ruled clinic blockades 
do not violate the rights of all prospective patients

former president reagan testified in a 
videotaped deposition released thursday he never had any 
inkling his aides were secretly arming the nicaraguan contras 
during a congressional ban on military aid 
in testimony for the upcoming trial of john poindexter the 
former president also said he remained unconvinced there had been a 
diversion of iran arms sale money to the rebels until prosecutors 
confronted him with the report of the tower commission he appointed 
reagan said he would have expected poindexter his former 
national security adviser to inform him of any diversion of funds 
to the contras unless maybe he thought he was protecting me from 
something 
reagans testimony was taken in los angeles last week and made 
available in washington the former president was jovial and testy 
by turns during eight hours winking at poindexter as he took the 
stand and talking amiably with the judge but also answering in 
abrupt fashion when irancontra prosecutor dan webb said he wasnt 
addressing a question 
he said at numerous points that he couldnt recall a date a 
name whether someone had told him something or not 
reagan said decisively that he agreed with a letter poindexter 
sent congress saying the white house was complying with the ban on 
help for the contras a letter that forms part of the basis for 
one charge poindexter faces 
but he also said when told by prosecutors that he was learning 
from them for the first time that former national security adviser 
robert mcfarlane poindexters predecessor had pleaded guilty to 
misleading congress in the affair 
reagan testified it was my impression that national 
security council aide oliver norths assistance to the contras was 
limited to communicating back and forth on the need for the 
support of the contras 
i guess that i had never had any inkling that we were 
guiding their strategy in any way reagan testified under 
questioning by webb 
asked what he thought north was doing reagan said that you 
have to have people that can be available to make contact with the 
leaders of the contras sometimes closer than just writing a 
letter 
it was my understanding because his name would crop up in 
memos and so forth that thats what he was doing the former 
president added 
poindexter who faces trial march 5 is charged with conspiracy 
two counts of obstructing congress and two counts of making false 
statements 
it was poindexters lawyers who had won a court order to take 
reagans testimony hoping to show reagan had approved of the 
activities that led to his former advisers indictment 
however irancontra prosecutors used crossexamination of 
reagan to introduce evidence that poindexter lied to reagan about 
the secret aid operation after a c123 cargo plane was shot down 
over nicaragua during a supply flight on oct 5 1986 
in written interrogatories to the irancontra grand jury 
earlier reagan said poindexter first told him that the sole 
survivor of the crash eugene hasenfus was not connected with the 
us government 
hasenfus who was tried and convicted of terrorism by 
nicaraguas sandinista government and later released was involved 
in norths secret resupply effort according to investigators 
during his videotaped testimony reagan said he couldnt recall 
which adviser told him about the crash and said he did not know if 
hasenfus was connected with norths secret operation 
reagan said thursday that no one has proven to me that 
profits from secret arms sales to iran were diverted to the rebels 
fighting the leftist sandinista government in nicaragua 
but later in his testimony reagan was confronted with details of 
the diversion from the february 1987 tower commission report 
this is the first time that i have ever seen a reference that 
actually specified there was a diversion reagan said of the 
muchpublicized report 
is this the first time that you came to realize in fact 
that a diversion had actually occurred asked webb 
yes replied reagan 
webb asked whether reagan expected poindexter to report such a 
diversion to his boss 
yes replied reagan unless maybe he thought he was 
protecting me from something 
at that point reagan seemed to lose his train of thought 
saying but no i dont understand this is very confusing to me 
about this 
poindexter told congress in 1987 that he purposely didnt tell 
the president about the diversion in order to provide him with 
deniability 
reagan grew testy with webb who told us district court judge 
harold greene that the former president had not answered his 
question reagan retorted that he was trying to be responsive 
he said he assured everybody that we would have to abide by 
the law during the ban on contra military aid 
reagan also testified under oath that he never authorized 
poindexter to obstruct congressional inquiries into the irancontra 
affair or to destroy documents 
he said he was never told that north had destroyed irancontra 
documents an act for which the former aide was convicted of a 
felony last year 
reagan may have helped poindexter by testifying that he could 
not recall when he knew about a november 1985 shipment of hawk 
missiles to iran the shipment figures in four of the five criminal 
charges against poindexter poindexter is accused of telling 
congress in november 1986 that us officials didnt find out that 
hawks were aboard the 1985 shipment until january 1986 
poindexter told congress in 1987 in testimony that cannot be 
used in his trial that he had given incorrect information earlier 
to congress because of a faulty memory 
i dont know when it would have been told to me or i would 
have known reagan said when asked about when he found out about 
the 1985 hawk shipment i some place along the line acquired 
that knowledge and i dont know from whom or where

gov madeleine kunin has suspended her 
press secretary without pay for two weeks for making a comment of a 
sexual nature to a woman reporter 
the suspension was ordered late wednesday one day after peter 
freyne made the comment which he said was a joke the remark came 
when betsy liley of the burlington free press asked him for a 
preview of the governors revenue forecast 
freynes reply if you took off all your clothes and 
performed a lewd act i might tell you 
he paused then added even if you did that i wouldnt tell 
you 
the exchange was overheard by another reporter and a kunin 
official both of whom confirmed the comment it came to kunins 
attention when a reporter for the rutland herald asked her about it 
for a story 
on tuesday kunin termed the remark totally inappropriate i 
think it was a sexist remark but i dont think that peter really 
is sexist 
she suspended freyne the following day after a growing number of 
legislators and womens groups protested 
in a letter to freyne kunin said i found totally 
reprehensible your remark to a reporter while you have apologized 
i believe you need some time to reflect on the impact of that 
remark 
freyne a former reporter said i learned my lesson im no 
longer a member of the fourth estate the cynical sardonic 
saturday night live wit of the fourth estate club is now verboten 
to me if i offended betsy or anyone im terribly sorry 
the editor of the monthly magazine vermont woman said the 
publication would call for freynes dismissal in its march issue 
to have him in that position showing such insensitivity to women 
is a liability to madeleine said gayle mb hanson 
kunin the states first woman governor has taken an active 
role nationally in promoting womens participation in politics and 
was vice chairwoman of the 1988 democratic national convention 
she is expected to seek a fourth twoyear term in november and 
could face a tough race against former gov richard snelling the 
leading republican candidate

the air force significantly understated the 
cost of billiondollar weapons systems making it all but 
impossible to allocate the nations limited funds the chairman 
of a senate panel said thursday 
the general accounting office the investigative arm of 
congress found that the air force lacks adequate accounting 
systems for its 275 billion in weapons systems inventories and 
other assets and annual appropriations of about 90 billion 
in response to news stories on the report sen john glenn 
dohio chairman of the senate governmental affairs committee 
issued a statement criticizing the air force and urging the service 
to act quickly to rectify its accounting problems 
this audit has uncovered some significant weaknesses which 
make it all but impossible for us to allocate our limited resources 
wisely or to identify areas that are highly susceptible to waste 
and fraud glenn said 
following a threeyear audit the gao discovered that among 
other things the air force understated the cost of the b1 bomber 
by at least 71 billion in its financial statements 
the air force accounting and financial management systems can 
neither provide complete and reliable financial data nor be 
depended upon to report accurately on the resources entrusted to 
its managers the gao said 
a draft copy of the report was obtained by the associated press 
the report faulted the air forces financial systems as being 
unable to provide managers with complete and reliable information 
on either acquisition or operating costs of aircrafts and missiles 
the procurement cost for each b1 bomber is reported by the 
air force to be 150 million gao found that the cost is in fact 
about 219 million similar underestimates exist with the f15 
and f16 aircraft the agency said 
charles bowsher us comptroller general plans to testify 
before the senate panel friday on the gao report 
meanwhile at the pentagon officials released a twopage letter 
the defense departments comptroller general sent to the gao on the 
report as well as a pointbypoint response to the agencys 26 
recommendations 
the department is concerned that the report may mislead some 
readers into thinking that the air force has misstated the cost of 
its aircraft or other programs to the congress sean okeefe the 
pentagons comptroller general wrote 
he said the air force reports its costs to congress through 
several channels 
but he also said the air force understands its accounting system 
needs improvement 
the gao report titled air force does not effectively account 
for billions of dollars of resources found that the service 
reported 638 billion in supplies and spare parts eight times 
the inventories of general motors 
however the systems used to provide accountability over these 
immense inventories do not provide reliable data supporting either 
their quantities or value the gao said 
the agency also discovered that almost 630 million worth of 
satellites and about 57 million worth of engines for c20a cargo 
planes that the air force paid for and owned were not recorded in 
any air force property or accounting system

q and i guess you had concerns did you not at that time that 
congress was going to delay if it were 
a yes 
q going to give any funding to the administration for the 
contras or the freedom fighters it was going to be delayed even 
more did you have concerns about that 
a we were always concerned yes 
q did you and admiral poindexter discuss any actions that you 
should take with regard to congress on getting this funding that 
you can think of 
a i cant think of anything more than just encouraging them to 
carry the battle to them 
q to carry the battle to i am sorry 
a to the congress about the need and the very definite need for 
continued help for these other countries down there 
q and if you were not if were not able to get any money from 
congress in that spring of 86 what were you prepared to do to 
somehow do it anyway 
a well no to find whatever way we could keep them in 
existence 
q and by that you are referring now once again to 
a to the contras 
q the third countries or private individuals 
a yes them and the refugees their families were being had 
to be taken care of while they were out there in the field and all 
q mr president do you know who oliver north is 
a yes 
q could you please describe to the jury what you know about 
oliver north and what his job was when he was working the white 
house 
a well he was mainly performing tasks as i understand it for 
the nsc national security council but he his background and 
record had been one of being decorate for heroism and so forth in 
the vietnamese conflict and that he had been a very bold and brave 
soldier marine 
and so he was it was my impression not from any specific 
reports or anything that in through all of this that he was 
communicating back and forth between on the need for the support of 
the contras and so forth 
q when you say communication back and forth between could 
you be a little more explicit for the jury even though you and i 
might know 
a yeah 
q maybe you can explain to the jury what you are referring to 
a well between the contras and their situation and ourselves 
and the things that we must do for them 
q in 1985 and 1986 did you know just tell the jury 
generally what you knew about what oliver north was doing with 
regard to helping the situation in central america visavis the 
freedom fighters 
a well you have to have people that can be available to make 
contact with the leaders of the contras and so forth sometimes 
closer than just writing a letter and it was my feeling and my 
understanding i did not meet individually with him to any extent 
at all but it was my understanding because his name would crop up 
in memos and so forth that thats what he was doing 
and i am trying to i think what the other angle i know that 
there was another area too in which he participated well for 
example in the meeting with the iranians he was involved in that 
and i think was actually there in the meetings with them whether 
all of the time or not i am not familiar 
q but in addition to colonel norths contacts with the contras 
do you know whether or not he had any contacts or made any 
presentations or speeches to fundraising groups that would raise 
money for the contras within the united states the private 
citizens 
a i dont know i as i say he would have been one that i 
cautioned that must obey the law at all times and i had made it 
plain that i didnt think that we should be out there trying to 
persuade the people to give money but we should offer that help to 
those who were doing that that if they needed help in contacting 
the leadership of the contras and so forth that he would be the 
in charge of that

some west virginia obstetricians are 
turning away new patients and some say they may leave the state 
because of a record 15 million malpractice award 
were working scared dr ujjal sandhu of charleston said 
thursday malpractice awards are skyrocketing there should be 
some reasonable compensation to victims but they shouldnt be made 
millionaires overnight 
a state jury last week awarded a couple 1525 million after 
they claimed their obstetrician failed to perform a caesarean 
section to prevent brain damage to their child 
mark and julie robinson of cabin creek said dr kanoj k biswas 
and the charleston area medical center should have performed the 
caesarean section after her son got stuck in the birth canal during 
delivery instead the couple said biswas used forceps to remove 
the baby causing a cutoff of oxygen and a brain hemorrhage 
several charleston obstetricians said in interviews that at 
least seven of their colleagues have stopped taking new patients 
some are leaving to practice in neighboring states with lower 
insurance costs sandhu said 
some will probably leave if they get a chance i would 
leave he said i dont want to worry about losing my shirt 
the patients will have to go out of state just like the doctors are 
leaving 
the award may compound the growing shortage of obstetricians in 
the state said dr bruce berry chairman of the west virginia 
section of the american college of obstetrics and gynecology 
the number of obstetricians in west virginia has dropped from 
135 to 65 in the last five years berry said twentyone family 
practitioners also deliver babies 
there were 23045 babies born in west virginia last year 
according to the state department of health 
berry of charleston said he quit obstetrics 14 months ago 
mainly because of the high cost of malpractice insurance 
dr paul fulcher of charleston who stopped taking new patients 
in response to the malpractice award said most obstetricians carry 
a minimum 1 million malpractice insurance maximum coverage is 10 
million berry said 
west virginia physicians pay about 63000 in liability 
insurance annually up to twice as much as doctors in virginia and 
kentucky said george rider executive director of the west 
virginia medical association the doctors group is uncertain why 
insurance companies charge more for malpractice insurance in west 
virginia he said 
obstetricians fear a big malpractice judgement could ruin them 
financially fulcher said 
most physicians had to think long and hard about this berry 
said but when it comes to the point where it threatens their 
familys security their family has to come first 
the average delivery costs 1200 to 1500 berry said that 
would rise by 500 to cover the cost of a 10 million liability 
policy he said 
obstetricians have proposed the state establish a reserve fund 
to cover large malpractice awards or impose a cap on such awards

an american detained last month 
purportedly for involvement with a cult known as the path of 
bliss appealed to the supreme court on thursday to gain her 
release her lawyer said 
patricia e munday of vermont was illegally detained by the 
west bengal state on jan 27 in violation of laws apparently for 
her religious links said her lawyer v m tarkunde 
tarkunde said ms munday 38 is associated with anand marg or 
the path of bliss the mysterious cult was founded in west 
bengal in 1955 by a former indian railways employee prabhat ranjan 
sarkar 
ms munday is a member of the un high commission for refugees 
said anand marg generalsecretary sarbatmanada avadhoota in 
calcutta the west bengal state capital but was on a private visit 
to india 
tarkunde said a mob attacked ms munday and an unidentified 
woman associate on jan 26 when they were traveling on a motorcycle 
near the anand marg headquarters in purulia district of west bengal 
he said ms munday was seriously injured but the purulia police 
instead of pursuing her complaint detained her the next day 
the lawyer said the attack on ms munday was engineered by 
hooligans of the marxist communist party which governs the 
state in coalition with other leftist parties 
ms munday whose hometown was not released was being held at a 
calcutta hospital said avadhoota 
tarkunde said the supreme court has informed the state and 
federal government of ms mundays petition it has asked them to 
send representatives to a court hearing friday the lawyer said 
the state government on feb 19 ordered ms mundays deportation 
without providing a reason but the deportation was stayed 
following an appeal to the state high court tarkunde said 
she was obviously attacked because she is an anand margi 
there is no other reason somehow the people dislike the anand 
margis but why should they be harassed said tarkunde a 
prominent human rights lawyer 
the anand marg says it has worldwide chapters with the aim of 
creating a socioeconomic and spiritual order to replace both 
capitalism and communism but the cult is also believed to practice 
black magic and human sacrifices and one of its rituals involves a 
dance holding skulls and daggers 
members of the marxist communist party have in the past clashed 
with anand marg members who accuse the government of persecution

q if the information that robert mcfarlane provided to 
congress in 1985 was false contained lies and deceived and 
obstructed congress would it still be your belief that john 
poindexter should readopt those false statements in responding to 
congress on july 21 1986 
mr beckler objection your honor calls for a legal conclusion 
us district judge harold greene overruled 
a well i simply no i did not have this information but i 
have a great deal of confidence in the man who was quoted as 
sending these letters mcfarlane and i have never i have never 
caught him or seen him doing anything that was in any way out of 
line or dishonest and so i was perfectly willing to accept his 
defense 
q i understand but i am just asking you as i understand it 
am i correct mr president that the letter that you are looking 
at there from john poindexter dated july 21 1986 you yourself 
actually did not approve and authorize those letters at the time 
that they were sent is that correct 
a i have no recollection of doing so 
q well as you sit here now do you have any recollection 
of approving for john poindexter to send these specific letters to 
congress 
a well again it is a case of memory i dont recall if he did 
or not 
q and my question to you is would you have approved the 
sending of these letters to congress by john poindexter if you knew 
that they adopted false information that had been previously 
supplied to congress by mr mcfarlane 
a no but i would also it would be very i would have to 
have it proven to me that they did 
q i take it as the chief executive and as president of the 
united states you did not want nor did you authorize your top 
officials of your administration to provide false information to 
congress is that a fair statement 
a that is a fair statement 
q i take it that is a fair statement that you were 
committed to helping the contras within any legal bounds that you 
could during that time period 
a yes 
q however as i understand your testimony at the same time 
that you were that you were doing that you attempted to keep 
your administrations contra assistance within the confines of the 
law at least that was your goal is that correct 
a yes 
q on direct examination you related to some extent that 
your attorney general ed meese on or about november 24 1986 after 
making some type of evaluation and inquiry into the iranian arms 
sale initiative advised you that he had discovered that there was 
some swiss bank accounts involved and that money out of the iran 
arms sales appeared to have gone in some way to assist the contras 
do you recall that 
a what i testified is that thats what was being published and 
carried on by the press but to this day all i know is that some 
sum of money over and above the 122milliondollar purchase price 
appeared in a swiss bank account in which it was said that account 
had been used on another occasion to provide help to the contras 
and to this day i still with all of the investigations that have 
been made i still have never been given one iota of evidence as to 
who collected the price who delivered the final delivery of the 
weapons or what was whether there was ever money in that swiss 
account that had been diverted someplace else i am still waiting 
to find those things out and have never found them out 
q and at the time that the iran initiative was ongoing were 
you aware that money was being diverted away from the iranian arms 
sales and diverted over to aid the contras were you aware of that 
a no i wasnt i was only aware finally that we got our twelve 
million two 
q had you approved or authorized that diversion while you 
were president of the united states 
a may i simply point out that i had no knowledge then or now 
that there had been a diversion and i never used the term and all 
i knew was that there was some money that came from some place in 
another account and that the appearance was that it might have 
been a part of the negotiated sale and to this day i dont have 
any information or knowledge that that wasnt the total amount that 
or that there was a diversion 
q to the extent that there was in fact a diversion of 
proceeds did you in any way approve or authorize that while you 
were president of the united states 
a for heavens sake no and when i was once asked about that 
extra money and said if it was an added sum to the purchase price 
what would i do i said i would have given it back 
q so the answer to my question is that you did not authorize 
or approve it it that correct 
a thats right 
q at any time sir while you were president did you ever 
approve or give authority to john poindexter to obstruct or impede 
any congressional committee inquiry into events relating to the 
irancontra controversy 
a no i dont 
q and at any time did you ever approve or give authority to 
john poindexter to make any false or misleading statements to any 
congressional committee regarding events related to the irancontra 
controversy 
a no and i dont think any false statements were made 
q at any time did john poindexter ever tell you that he 
had plans to make or cause others to make any false or misleading 
statements to any congressional committees regarding events related 
to the irancontra affair 
a there was never any such thing that he ever said to me that 
was false or misleading

nasa on thursday delayed the launch 
of atlantis for a second day to let the shuttles commander recover 
from a sore throat and to await better weather 
the secret military mission to put a spy satellite in orbit is 
not expected to take off until saturday morning at the earliest 
the shuttle originally was scheduled for a predawn liftoff 
thursday but was postponed wednesday when navy capt john o 
creighton became ill the second time the space program has delayed 
a flight because of a sick astronaut 
nasa delayed the launch yet another day on the recommendation of 
doctors examining creighton who complained of a sore throat and 
congestion 
physicians report that his condition has improved but 
that he still has some infection of the upper respiratory tract 
the space agency said in a statement additionally weather 
conditions presently are not expected to be satisfactory for 
fueling required for a morning launch 
nasa said it would decide whether to proceed with a saturday 
launch after examining creighton and the forecast on friday 
saturdays outlook was a scant 20 percent chance for liftoff 
because of an approaching cold front but that was to improve to 70 
percent by sunday 
in 1969 the apollo 9 mission to orbit the earth and test the 
lunar landing module was delayed three days after the three crewmen 
got sick 
nasa said it had no plans to replace creighton on the mission 
because his illness was not serious responding in writing to 
reporters questions nasa flight surgeons said the prognosis is 
good but they didnt say when the commander might be able to fly 
creighton was quarantined and the four other crew members were 
healthy and isolated the doctors said changes in cabin 
pressure normally experienced in flight would cause creighton pain 
in his present condition they said 
the delays came before technicians had begun pumping more than 
half a million gallons of propellant into atlantis fuel tank for 
the fourday mission which was to end at edwards force base calif 
pumping the fuel would have added 377000 to the cost to 
kennedy space center of delaying the mission each days delay 
costs 247000 in labor and materials that does not include 
expenses at other nasa centers supporting the mission 
sources said atlantis cargo is a 37300pound 500 million 
satellite capable of taking supersharp photos and eavesdropping on 
electronic communications around the world its path will carry it 
over most of the soviet union 
nasa has not announced a precise launch time since atlantis 
cargo is classified but sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said it would take place around 1 am 
atlantis flight will be the 34th shuttle flight and the sixth 
secret military mission

snipers exchanged gunfire intermittently 
in the christian enclave thursday and mediators tried to forge a 
settlement in the power struggle between rival christian leaders 
police said about 3000 families left east beirut for the citys 
moslem western sector the eastern bekaa valley and northern 
lebanon fearing renewed clashes between the lebanese forces 
militia of samir geagea and army troops of gen michel aoun 
a threeman christian mediation committee called a ceasefire 
saturday and has been meeting with aoun and geagea to try to work 
out a settlement 
the chances of prolonging the truce darkened thursday evening 
when aoun accused geagea of procrastinating to win time and 
prepare for a new confrontation 
at least 681 people have been killed and 1878 wounded since the 
confrontation broke out jan 30 and escalated into the worst 
intrachristian fighting in nearly 15 years of civil war 
the continued evacuation and stockpiling of weapons and 
ammunition by the rival forces reflected fear that clashes could 
break out again if mediation efforts failed a police spokesman 
said 
aoun called a televised news conference at his headquarters in 
the presidential palace in suburban baabda thursday evening and 
told reporters 
there is no use negotiating with geagea he wants another 
collision we are giving the mediators deeds and he is giving them 
words 
i am letting the mediators try and try until they get fed up 
then they will come to me and say they have given up i dont give 
the negotiations with geagea much chance procrastination is going 
to bring more disasters 
aoun made no comment on an offer by geagea for a unified 
command for his 6000strong militia and the 19000 troops under 
aoun 
geagea made the call in an interview with the londonbased 
arabic language daily alhayat 
geageas offer appeared to be an attempt to put off aouns 
demand that the militia be changed into a political organization 
while its fighters join the army 
all we want is political independence and the preservation of 
the lebanese forces geagea said we are ready to combine the 
military effort militia with the army and the general within the 
framework of a joint command 
meanwhile about 400 women demonstrated in east beiruts 
residential district of ashrafiyeh controlled by geageas 
militiamen demanding an end to the barbaric destructive 
shelling of our area 
we are lebanese we are christians why have you knocked down 
our houses the demonstrators chanted 
ashrafiyeh which sits on the highest hill in beirut commands 
the network of roads leading to the citys port which also is 
controlled by geageas militiamen on the southwestern tip of the 
310squaremile christian enclave 
military analysts said if hostilities resumed aoun would try to 
overrun ashrafiyeh to seize the port and ensure safe supply lines 
by sea 
savage fighting has inflicted an estimated 750 million worth of 
damage on the christian enclaves residential districts and 
commercial thoroughfares 
the threeman mediation committee said in a statement it has 
achieved progress in its mission to defuse the explosive 
situation 
the atmosphere is encouraging the statement said without 
elaborating 
the independent newspaper annahar said palestine liberation 
organization chairman yasser arafat also was mediating the conflict 
between geagea and aoun 
arafats representative in lebanon zeid wehbe and two other 
plo officials have been holding talks with the rival christian 
leaders since tuesday they proposed a team of arab observers 
disengage the warring christian forces annahar said 
the palestinian team according to the paper warned both geagea 
and aoun that syria would intervene militarily in the christian 
enclave if the intrachristian showdown were renewed 
syria which has 40000 troops in predominantly moslem lebanese 
areas under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the 22nation arab 
league is the major arab enemy of aoun geagea and arafat

a no 
q if you will accept for a moment that it was in the 
october of 1984 that congress that that law came into existence 
that cut off the funding for the contras at that time if you could 
go back with me a bit in time mr president to that time period 
after october of 1984 and going forward up to november of 1986 
do you recall at any time ever authorizing or approving the 
national security council accepting the transfer of 
responsibilities from the central intelligence agency to continue 
to aid the contras after the passage of the boland amendment in 
the same way that the cia had done before the passage of boland

q you indicated that you do have an understanding or a 
recollection that oliver north after the boland amendment passed 
in october of 1984 that he did have some contact with contra 
leaders is that correct 
a i think it is yes there wasnt as i say i had assured 
everybody that we would have to abide by the law but i didnt 
think there was anything in the law that prevented us from 
remaining in contact with the people that we had been trying to 
help and working with 
q i understand but is it fair to say mr president is it 
true that even though you had an understanding that he had some 
contact with the contras after boland passed atno time did you 
know or have any indication whatsoever that oliver l north was 
participating in planning and directing and advising the contras in 
connection with military and paramilitary activities including 
giving logistical support you had no idea he was doing that did 
you sir 
a no i guess that i had never had never had any inkling that 
we were guiding their strategy in any way

cattle producers are headed for another year 
of recordhigh market prices an agriculture department analysis 
indicated thursday 
total beef production by slaughter plants is expected to rise 
about 2 percent because of increased cattle marketings and heavier 
weights the departments economics research service said in its 
report 
but an expanding us population and increases in net beef 
exports will more than offset the larger output the report said 
that will mean less beef available on a per capita basis 
consequently market prices of choicegrade fed steers sold on 
the omaha neb market in 1990 may average about 1 more than last 
years record of 7250 per pound the report said that would push 
retail prices up 1 percent to 3 percent 
hog prices also are going up and may average in the range of 47 
to 53 per 100 pounds in 1990 compared with a little more than 44 
last year at the major markets 
retail pork prices have risen in recent months reflecting 
higher hog prices and wider farmtoretail marketing spreads 
the report said retail pork prices for the year may increase 6 
percent to 8 percent from last year

aflcio leaders closed their annual 
meeting thursday with a call for the federations 14 million 
members to send additional financial aid to striking machinists at 
eastern airlines 
i dont know if the strike is ever going to be over because 
were going be to there with them just as long as it takes said 
gerald mcentee president of the american federation of state 
county and municipal employees 
the aflcios 33member board declared that the eastern strike 
remains as solid as ever it asked unions across the country to 
adopt groups of machinists and send money to help their 
families 
the 8500 machinists who walked out nearly a year ago inspired 
workers nationwide because theyve been on the front lines of 
labors battle against corporate greed and intransigence the 
board said 
the eastern situation was a sore spot for labor leaders during a 
weeklong meeting otherwise marked by optimism that organized labor 
is regaining political and bargaining power after a loss of stature 
in the 1980s 
aflcio leaders were jubilant in announcing tuesday that the 
10month pittston coal strike was ending the appalachian miners 
ratified a contract that gave them victories on health care and job 
security 
in addition union leaders met with prominent democrats who are 
enlisting their help in the 1990 elections which will determine 
who controls next years congressional redistricting 
union leaders also received a boost with a report showing that 
the publics image of the american labor movement is improving 
weve been tempered i think by a period of fire and in the 
net result its strengthened us aflcio president lane kirkland 
said 
labor officials attribute much of their improved standing to 
efforts on issues that affect all americans such as health care 
in an effort to keep abortion off the weeks agenda the board 
named a 14member panel to study whether the federation should 
adopt a prochoice position 
when union leaders met with labor secretary elizabeth dole on 
tuesday eastern was the only major point of contention 
aflcio leaders said their relationship with the white house has 
improved since the reagan era but the federation said the bush 
administration doesnt care about the survival of eastern and has 
sided with management in the machinists strike 
kirkland conceded that so far the strike has failed but said 
easterns parent texas air corp had not won either 
labor leaders also acknowledged they lack the votes in congress 
to override president bushs veto of legislation that would create 
a commission to settle the dispute

the political outlook may have improved a bit 
for the north in new census population estimates 
the south and west will wrest away some seats in the house of 
representatives after the 1990 national head count but maybe not 
as many as had originally been thought 
the constitution requires seats in the house to be redistributed 
among states after each census 
the private population reference bureau analyzed a complex 
series of new census estimates on thursday and predicted that 14 
house seats will move from the northeast and midwest to the south 
and west after the census 
earlier analyses by the same group had indicated as many as 18 
seats would move 
the census estimates include four sets of possible state 
populations for 1990 each differing slightly depending on the 
amount of interstate movement by people 
one set included no movement and was discounted by the private 
analysis group 
but while reapportionment calculations based on the other three 
varied slightly the overall shift in seats was consistent 
the big winner will be california gaining six seats based on 
the new figures the previous calculations had called for 
california to gain five seats 
texas and florida will gain three seats each the new estimates 
indicate earlier calculations had shown texas adding four seats 
and florida three 
arizona and georgia which had previously been expected to gain 
two seats apiece are now expected to add one the new study said 
virginia also will gain one as had been expected north 
carolina would add one seat under two of the estimates but would 
remain unchanged under the third 
on the losing side new york is still expected to lose three 
seats pennsylvania which had been expected to drop three now 
appears likely to lose just two ohio illinois and michigan will 
drop two each the same as previously expected 
also unchanged are losses of one seat each by west virginia 
iowa kansas and massachusetts 
wisconsin which had been expected to lose a seat would not do 
so under the new figures and montana would lose a seat under two 
estimates but not under the third 
following the 1990 census the census bureau will present the 
white house with the final state population figures and the new 
reapportionment numbers

a usflag kuwaiti tanker loaded with 
naphtha and diesel fuel exploded thursday in the persian gulf and 
two american crewmen were believed killed 
the other 23 seamen all americans but one abandoned the 
burning ship and were rescued by a us navy frigate 
us sources speaking on condition of anonymity said remains 
had been found in the water but it was not clear whether they were 
of one or two people a us military spokesman said he could not 
confirm the report 
other american military sources said the two men missing and 
evidently killed were the captain and first mate of the 81283ton 
surf city but further identification would have to come from the 
owners the kuwait oil tanker co no one at the company was 
available for comment thursday night 
capt ron wildermuth chief spokesman for us central command 
headquarters in tampa fla said there were no reports of mines 
from the iraniraq war in the area and initial reports indicate 
the explosion was internal 
the surf city exploded 20 miles off the united arab emirates 
said us officials and shipping sources in the gulf 
it was a huge explosion the ship just blew up said wayne 
cohen 27 of boston who was standing watch on the bridge 
he and crewman earl washington from louisiana were cut by 
flying glass when the pilot house windows shattered cohen said 
there was some panic he said in a telephone interview we 
made our way to the lifeboat 
both were among survivors picked up by the missile frigate uss 
simpson and were taken to a hospital in dubai 
cohen a member of the surf city crew since september said he 
looked back as the lifeboat reached the simpson and saw nothing 
but fire and smoke 
late in the day the tanker was reported still burning and 
taking on water wildermuth said us warships and other craft in 
the area were standing off in case of another explosion in the 
highly volatile cargo 
the surf city was among 11 kuwaiti tankers given us flags in 
1987 so the navy could protect them from iran which had made 
kuwaits merchant fleet a target because it supported iraq in the 
war 
in 198788 the surf city made dozens of trips unscathed under 
us escort no armed attacks or minings have been reported in the 
gulf since iran and iraq agreed to a ceasefire in august 1988 
an iranian silkworm missile badly damaged a sister tanker the 
sea isle city at kuwaits main loading terminal oct 19 1987 two 
months earlier the reflagged supertanker bridgeton struck an 
iranian mine on the navys first convoy up the gulf 
direct escort ended five months after the truce but us navy 
ships still monitor the movements of usflag tankers 
thursdays explosion occurred as the surf city was sailing out 
of the gulf through one of its busiest shipping lanes between the 
united arab emirates and abu musa an iranian island 
cohen said some work was being done on one of the ships 
starboard cargo tanks about midway down the 700foot deck where 
the explosion occurred he said the missing men were in the area 
the simpson on patrol three miles away was observing the surf 
city visually and on radar officials said the missile destroyer 
uss dewey another of the 10 us warships on duty in the gulf 
also went to the scene as did several patrol craft and helicopters 
from the emirates 
a statement from the kuwait oil tanker co said the fire spread 
quickly from the blast point toward the stern where the engine 
room bridge and crews quarters are located 
it said the tanker was listing and salvage tugs were trying to 
recover it shipping executives said the tugs were forced to stay 
clear because of the fire 
when the ships were put under the american flag in 1987 an 
exception to us maritime law was made that let them sail with 
foreign rather than exclusively american crews 
that changed a year ago when six of the ships were removed from 
us registry the united states extended the contract for the 
other five including the surf city on condition they use american 
crews 
central command officials said they could not explain why the 
surf city carried a britishcanadian chief engineer

q if he did that you never knew about it 
a no 
q mr president did you ever authorize oliver north or the 
national security council to use richard secord or albert hakim to 
assist in providing financial and military support for the contras 
a no i had heard reports about them in connection with some of 
the private groups that were trying to reach the contras with aid 
and so forth i knew very little about either one of them or but 
i had heard their names connected with such things 
q do you recall an incident occurring involving a pilot 
named gene hasenfus that was shot down over nicaragua carrying arms 
to the contras 
a i have a memory of a plane that was shot down and that one 
of the people who turned out unhurt but all right was an american 
citizen and i had no knowledge that he was involved in any way 
nor do i recall his indicating that he was in of having anything 
to do with the government and our program but there he was and 
apparently a prisoner 
q and my question to you is do you recall who the first person 
was in government who told you that gene hasenfus who was shot 
down over nicaragua had no connection to the united states 
government or the national security council do you know who told 
you that 
a i do not recall who told me that but that was the 
information that i had 
q as i understand your statement under oath in the 
interrogatories which i believe you accept as a truthful 
statement admiral poindexter assured you that the hasenfus 
operation had no connection to the united states government 
whatsoever is that what you state there 
a yes and i opened that statement with saying to the best of 
my knowledge i first learned of the hasenfus crash from admiral 
poindexter 
q i understand and you gave a date there that you believe you 
learned it on october 7 1986 is that correct 
a well let me find that october 7 86 yes 
q and you go on to say under oath in your interrogatory that 
when poindexter told you that hasenfus had no connection to the 
united states government whatsoever you go on to say when i 
asked whether john singlaub might be involved in this operation as 
had been reported in the press i was told no by admiral 
poindexter do you say that 
a yes 
q mr president when your tower commission reported back to 
you in march of 1987 did the tower commission not tell you mr 
president oliver north and your national security council were 
involved in 1985 and 1986 in assisting the contras militarily and 
paramilitarily do you recall that being told to you by your tower 
commission 
a i dont recall that and i can only tell you 
q i will try to 
a that my interest in that commission was to find out the 
thing that i still do not know and that was how did there turn out 
to be more money than the 122 million for the tow tank missiles 
who delivered and who obviously it seemed to me that someone 
must have raised the price for those but that was never found out 
i still do not know 
and then to talk as they do about a diversion of money that was 
found in that swiss bank account i have no information at all that 
there was ever any more money than was in the account when it was 
found or that any diversion to anyone had been attempted of that 
money 
judge greene the letter from mr mcfarlane to congress 
apparently indicates that no effort has been made or will be made 
to provide military or paramilitary support for military or 
paramilitary operations in nicaragua the tower commission report 
appears to indicate that col north did make expenditures for 
contra military equipment supplies and so on 
do you find that the two are consistent with each other or if 
they are inconsistent do you find that the second one brands the 
first one as a falsehood 
i think that is what he is trying to find out 
a well i have to say theres in the wording of all of this 
possibly there is a it could be int interpreted that other way i 
had not because i am remembering my telling those same people to be 
helpful to private citizens who were trying to do something that 
the congress of the united states refused to do and abandoning its 
responsibility 
q mr president in connection with your statement or testimony 
that as you looked at mcfarlanes letter to congressman barnes as 
you looked at it this morning and said that it looked okay to you 
did you consider and do you remember that mr mcfarlane the man 
who sent the letter has pled guilty in open court to withholding 
information from congress in connection with that letter 
a no i was not aware of that 
q is it fair to say that as the year 1986 went on you were 
generally aware that there were some shipments of weapons to iran 
under the finding that you signed on january 17th but you dont 
but you yourself are not aware of the underlying operational 
details 
a no i am not 
q one of the things am i correct that you did not ever 
know about and were never advised of is that the iranians were 
being charged a price substantially in excess of the price that the 
united states was receiving for the weapons is that correct you 
were never aware of that 
a no that is the thing that i have been talking about for a 
long time that i am still waiting to find out who raised the price 
on them

the bush administration opposes placing more 
economic sanctions on south africa because when someone is 
starting to do the right thing you dont kick them an official 
said thursday 
herman cohen the assistant secretary of state for african 
affairs predicted south africas whiteruled government might be 
able to satisfy conditions that could lead to the removal of us 
economic sanctions in the next three months 
in my opinion the end of officially sanctioned racial 
oppression in south africa is on the horizon he said during an 
appearance before two house subcommittees this is the beginning 
of an exciting new phase that will determine the shape of a 
nonracial democratic south africa 
but cohen said the bush administration objects to a house 
resolution that would tighten the sanctions by preventing us 
banks from rescheduling south african debt 
he said you dont kick people when theyre on the right path 
to reform 
cohens comments came as a bipartisan congressional group 
pledged to keep sanctions in force until south africas president 
fw de klerk meets all conditions for the lifting of sanctions 
congress imposed the sanctions in 1986 over the veto of 
thenpresident reagan the sanctions spell out specific things the 
south african government must do in order for washington to remove

q now at any time prior to november of 1986 while the iranian 
initiative was going on do you recall any conversation with your 
national security adviser john poindexter in which he in any way 
hinted or suggested or in any way told you anything about these 
excess profits and the diversion to the contras 
a there was never any such conversation because the only 
information we had was that there was money in excess over the 122 
million that had been deposited in a swiss bank account 
q let me see if i can help refresh your memory from your tower 
commission what they told you do you see there the portion 
that i called to your attention 
a i have just seen it and i have to tell you to my 
recollection this is the first time i have ever seen that 
this report this is the first time that i have ever seen a 
reference that actually specified there was a diversion 
q my question is if he poindexter knew about it you would 
have expected him to tell you about it is that correct 
a yes unless maybe he thought he was protecting me from 
something but no i dont understand this is very confusing to 
me about this

the bush administration thursday said it 
opposed a house bill that would increase taxes on employers to 
protect the jobless from a sudden cut in unemployment benefits in a 
severe recession 
the national governors association said it also objected to the 
bill which would raise the federal unemployment insurance taxable 
wage base from 7000 to 10000 
the bill by reps thomas downey dny donald pease dohio 
and sander levin dmich is aimed at averting a repeat of the 
198182 recession when cashstarved states cut benefits and 
restricted eligibility as their jobless rates soared above 10 
percent 
we see no programatic justification for such an increase 
deputy assistant labor secretary carolyn golding told the house 
ways and means subcommittee on human resources which is chaired by 
downey 
ms golding said the unemployment trust funds now have state and 
federal reserves totaling 45 billion she said one state 
michigan still owes 800 million from the 14 billion borrowed by 
26 states in 198284 to meet benefit payments 
some states remain in positions that could require borrowing 
if such a downturn occurred ms golding said but there has 
been significant overall improvement in the solvency of the trust 
funds 
despite the improvement congressional auditors in the general 
accounting office said thursday the reserves still appear to be 
inadequate to handle a severe recession 
at the end of 1989 only six states had enough reserves to 
maintain benefits in a severe recession for 18 months the target 
recommended in the past by the labor department and most state 
employment security administrators the gao said 
and the overall system has only 11 months of recessionlevel 
benefits in reserve compared with a 22month reserve two decades 
ago the auditors said 
congress decision in 1982 to make states pay interest on money 
they borrowed to maintain benefits has made the system more 
solvent the gao said but at a cost of higher unemployement 
insurance taxes and reduced eligibility 
but ohio employment services administrator ellen obrien told 
the hearing that instead of increasing taxes the government should 
redivide the tax pie so states get a bigger share 
employers who finance this system through the federal 
unemployment tax act are investing enough money to provide adequate 
service she said no new taxes are necessary to return the 
program to its proper funding level 
as the program now works most covered employers pay into the 
system a minimum gross tax of 62 percent on the first 7000 in 
annual wages to a worker on their payroll 
that tax rate would fall to 6 percent at the end of this year 
of the 436 now collected each year per worker 56 goes to the 
federal government and the other 380 goes to the states which 
adjust the actual tax rates on each employer according to the 
firms unemployment experience 
thirtysix states have adopted floors above the mandated 7000 
level ranging from 7100 in connecticut up to 20900 in alaska

lawyers for an alabama youth facing a possible 
death sentence in his home state asked the supreme court on 
thursday to overrule the district of columbia court that ordered 
his extradition 
gerald fisher attorney for the 17yearold boy who has been 
identified in court proceedings by the initials om said the 
petition for supreme court review automatically will postpone the 
district of columbia court order approving his extradition until 
the high court decides whether to hear the case 
om is charged with arson and murder in the death of 
14monthold tamal jackson who was killed in the may 1988 
firebombing of an apartment in a gadsden ala housing project if 
returned to alabama and certified for trial as an adult he could 
face the death penalty 
two uncles of om 32yearold yul devoe guice and an 
18yearold identified only by the initials st also face arson 
and murder charges in the same case guice is being held in an 
alabama prison on an unrelated charge and st is being held by 
district of columbia authorities 
st also is fighting extradition to alabama but his case has 
been put on hold by district of columbia court officials until the 
final disposition of the om case 
om who is black has attracted widespread attention in his 
long fight to avoid extradition because of his contention that he 
cannot get a fair trial from the predominantly white judicial 
system in etowah county ala where his father and another 
relative died while in police custody

a smalltown jury thursday acquitted 
a record store owner of obscenity charges for selling a sexually 
explicit tape by a rap group 
the circuit court jury took less than 1 hours to decide in 
favor of tommy hammond who earlier was found guilty in municipal 
court in what the american civil liberties union called the 
nations first obscenity conviction for music hammond had appealed 
that conviction and was granted a trial in the higher court 
he was charged with violating a 1983 city ordinance against 
obscenity for selling move somethin by the group 2 live crew 
the ordinance carries a fine of 500 
the group records on the skyywalker label which paid half 
hammonds legal fees in the first round of the legal fight in 
alexander city a town of about 14000 
judge james avery told jurors their verdict certainly will 
help people in the future on how to approach this type of thing 
in other cities in alabama and across the nation youve taken 
part in a historic case 
scattered applause broke out in the courtroom after the verdict 
was announced 
hammond said he expected to be found innocent 
when you start messing with first amendment rights you ought 
to be protected people in this community feel that way he said 
during the fourday trial jurors listened to the tapes 
streetlanguage lyrics which include explicit lines about oral and 
anal sex and sadomasochism 
at issue was whether the tape which has sold more than 1 
million copies violates accepted community standards part of the 
doctrine laid down by the us supreme court during the 1970s 
juror eddie futral said the 2 live crew tape wasnt any more 
offensive than other music videotapes or magazines that are 
available in alexander city and were introduced as evidence by the 
defense 
when they showed all the things that were tolerated in the 
city at the time i couldnt see any difference between them 
futral said 
defense attorney bobby segall had urged jurors to protect the 
freedom of every citizen of alabama the right to say that which 
is unsayable 
where in the world do you draw the line on what obscenity 
is he asked 
he said the eddie murphy movie raw is as sexually explicit 
as the tape and that the movie had been shown at a theater in town 
if you want obscenity stopped you can stop it prosecutor 
danny brown said in closing arguments there is no question he 
knew the nature and character of that work it exhibits a total 
disregard for women 
police chief lynn royall testified that he listened to less than 
a minute of the tape before deeming it obscene and authorizing 
hammonds arrest he said he was concerned about the musics effect 
on teenagers

leaders of the centerleft labor party on 
thursday threatened to quit israels coalition government unless 
the cabinet adopts compromises within two weeks aimed at starting 
an israelipalestinian dialogue 
the 107member labor bureau passed a resolution saying there 
is a need for an immediate decision on issues that will ensure the 
continuation of the peace process and a further delay will cause 
serious harm to israel 
it added the condition for the continuation of the 
national unity government is the continuation of the peace 
process 
cabinet approval of the compromises which would mean allowing 
deported palestinians and east jerusalem residents to participate 
in peace talks would require prime minister yitzhak shamirs likud 
bloc to drop its opposition to the moves 
disagreements over the peace process have threatened to break up 
the likudlabor partnership at least four times but thursdays 
resolution was the strongest by labor since formation of the 
government in december 1988 
it comes at a time when shamir faces a potential split in his 
own party over demands by hardliners that he rule out any 
compromise in the peace process 
shamirs chief likud rival ariel sharon who quit as trade 
minister four days ago over disagreements on peace moves urged the 
prime minister to unite against any compromise 
shamir should reject the labor ultimatum immediately he 
said 
shamir interviewed on israel television said he never received 
any ultimatum and added we will discuss every issue in its own 
time and hour as is obligated 
the likud faction in parliament issued a statement rejecting the 
labor threat saying the fate of the nation or foreign policy 
will not be determined with a stopwatch israel tv reported 
labors move came after defense minister yitzhak rabin the 
partys no 2 man eased his demand that labor remain in the 
likudled coalition 
he told israel army radio he changed his mind after egypt which 
has been representing the palestine liberation organization in 
usbrokered peace efforts gave reasonable answers on the 
makeup of a palestinian peace delegation and the agenda for a 
dialogue 
rabin denied labors move was an ultimatum but he also said 
egypts answers could put israel in the role of holding up the 
peace process 
if the delay comes from here there is doubt whether there is 
a point in the continuation of the government he said 
the resolution was adopted unanimously by the labor bureau 
which runs the partys daytoday affairs at a meeting in tel 
aviv it calls for labors government ministers to bring the 
compromise steps to a cabinet vote within two weeks 
rabin and labors leader vice premier shimon peres disagreed 
on when the party should consider quitting the government 
rabin said the cabinet could hold more than one meeting on the 
issue but peres it would be the end of the story if a cabinet 
vote was not taken by march 7 
the party has scheduled a meeting on march 15 for its 
1300member central committee to consider the partys continuation 
in the government 
the compromises that labor wants are part of us secretary of 
state james a baker iiis effort to revive israels stalled plan 
for elections in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
baker has urged an israelipalestinian dialogue to help set up 
the elections which would lead to limited autonomy for the 
territories and later talks on their final status 
the compromises call for palestinians in the initial talks to 
include six residents of the occupied lands two deportees brought 
back from exile and two residents of israeliannexed east jerusalem 
who have other homes in the territories the talks would focus on 
the elections but could include opening statements on other issues 
the compromise is intended to satisfy plo demands to include 
overseas palestinians while recognizing israels insistence that 
it will only negotiate with residents of the occupied lands 
environment minister ronnie milo a confidant of shamir 
repeated likuds opposition to the compromises deportees and 
east jerusalem arabs this is something that is not included in the 
initiative of the israeli government milo told army radio 
israel annexed arab east jerusalem after it was captured from 
jordan along with the west bank in the 1967 middle east war

the spread of ballistic missiles and other 
modern weaponry in the third world poses a growing threat to us 
security the navys top officer told congress thursday 
adm carlisle ah trost chief of naval operations said that 
while a lowering of superpower tensions made global warfare less 
likely in the 1990s us armed forces will be challenged to 
protect american security in an era of violent peace 
there was a time when conflict in developing countries 
conjured a vision of simple lowtech warfare that would not 
require sophisticated weapons that time has passed trost told 
the house appropriations subcommittee on defense 
today around the globe developing countries are armed with 
first world weapons he said and as a result virtually any 
nation or group of terrorists can bring capable and deadly weapons 
to bear 
thus the united states should remain able to project its naval 
power worldwide he said 
in pleading with congress to avoid big cuts in navy manpower and 
weapons programs trost sounded a theme that lawmakers have heard 
from all service branches in recent weeks the bush administration 
has proposed trimming the defense budget next year by about 2 
percent after inflation but momentum is building in congress to 
cut much more deeply in response to the waning of the cold war 
trost acknowledged that perhaps we are at the end of the cold 
war but he stressed that a wellequipped military still was 
needed to handle hostilities in the third world 
trost said 102 countries in addition to the united states and 
the soviet union now have cruise missiles by the year 2000 at 
least 15 countries will be producing their own ballistic missiles 
he said 
trost also said 14 countries besides the two superpowers have 
chemical weapons and 11 are suspected of developing them he said 
three countries besides the superpowers have bacteriological 
weapons and 15 may be developing them

the bush administrations opposition to a new 
civil rights bill has forced officials to seek changes in another 
bill that specifically protects the rights of the nations 43 
million disabled people 
the issue centering on how to punish employment discrimination 
arose thursday during testimony by an administration official 
before a house committee reviewing the proposed americans with 
disabilities act 
the proposed disabilities law would guarantee the rights of 
disabled people to employment goods and services a version that 
was passed by the senate last september was a delicate compromise 
that had been negotiated with the white house 
the administration however opposes a more recently submitted 
bill the civil rights act of 1990 that bill would give more 
enforcement clout to the civil rights act of 1964 by making it 
possible to seek compensatory and punitive damages for employment 
discrimination 
enactment of this proposed civil rights act of 1990 would 
significantly expand the remedies available under the ada to 
include compensatory and punitive damages james p turner 
acting assistant attorney general for civil rights told the house 
small business committee 
turner said the administration has opposed including 
compensatory and punitive damages in the disabilities act just as 
it has in other civil rights legislation 
inclusion of such extraordinary relief as punitive damages is 
simply unwarranted in a statutory scheme as new bold and complex 
as the provision of disabilities rights concepts to the american 
business community he said 
turner proposed that the disabilities bill instead outline 
specific sanctions without reference to the broader civil rights 
act he said he was not trying to hold the disabilities bill 
hostage but instead was trying to speed up its passage in view 
of the anticipated fight against the 1990 civil rights act 
the administration proposal is anathema to advocates of the 
disabilities bill who reject any effort to give the disabled civil 
rights protection that differs from the protection afforded to 
blacks other minorities and women 
we cannot understand why the bush administration would oppose 
monetary damages for victims of intentional discrimination said 
ralph g neas executive director of the leadership conference on 
civil rights a coalition of 185 rights groups 
and we are incredulous that the administration would be 
willing to treat persons with disabilities differently from other 
victims of intentional discrimination neas said

first four months of the fiscal year totaled 5978 billion the 
treasury said thursday the grammrudman deficitreduction law 
limits the fiscal 1990 imbalance to 100 billion

the 1990 deficit through january was 77 percent lower than that 
for the first four months of fiscal 1989 januarys surplus 
contrasted with a 146 billion imbalance during december

inflated artificially by sampl bailout borrowing

totaled 5604 billion up 50 percent from december collections 
individual income tax receipts are expected to remain high through 
the april 15 deadline for filing 1989 returns 
receipts were inflated in january by 5 billion borrowed through 
a special offbudget agency called the resolution funding corp 
normally government borrowing does not count as revenue 
overall receipts totaled 9954 billion in january up 115 
percent from january 1989 outlays were 8962 billion a 36 
percent increase over the same month a year ago the deficit is the 
difference between revenue and spending 
so far this fiscal year receipts totaled 3283 billion up 56 
percent from the first four months of fiscal 1989 outlays totaled 
3881 billion up 33 percent from the octoberjanuary period of

the two germanys should reduce their combined 
military by twothirds when they unite and some us and soviet 
soldiers should remain during the unification process the east 
german defense minister said thursday 
adm theodor hoffmann said the armed forces should be purely 
defensive and both states should remain in their respective 
alliances until they are reunited under a new european security 
system 
west germany belongs to nato and east germany is in the 
sovietled warsaw pact about 380000 soviet soldiers are stationed 
in east germany and nato has more than 300000 in west germany 
including about 250000 americans 
hoffmann said a joint german military should be reduced to about 
300000 men initially and later to 150000200000 
all three services army navy and air force should be 
retained because all are essential to defense he told a news 
conference 
gen hans deim east germanys delegate to vienna talks on 
reduction of conventional forces told the reporters anything over 
300000 men would cause security concerns of our neighbors 
especially france and poland 
west germany has 490000 military personnel and east germany 
says its armed forces have shrunk from 170000 men to 100000 in 
recent months 
until a new european system supplants nato and the warsaw pact 
hoffman said us and soviet soldiers should remain on german 
territory even if this becomes symbolic at a certain time 
the united states and soviet union have agreed to reduce their 
troop strength in central europe to 195000 each most of the 
reductions will be made in germany 
keeping some us and soviet troops until unification under a 
new security system would preserve stability in europe hoffmann 
said and described fears of a hasty union as justified 
although unification is unstoppable it is going faster than 
the process of uniting all of europe and europeans have 
legitimate security concerns about it the defense minister 
said 
our neighbors have had bitter experiences with a united 
germany he added recalling the two world wars of this century 
talks with the west german military on merging forces could 
begin soon after east germanys first free elections are held march 
18 and a new government is formed hoffmann said 
the victorious world war ii allies the united states soviet 
union britain and france have agreed on a twostage plan for 
reunification 
after talks between the germanys on merging their political 
economic and legal systems the four powers are to join them for 
discussions of the international ramifications 
some europeans worry about the formula called two plus four 
and poland wants a peace treaty guaranteeing its borders on 
thursday britain expressed support for the polish demand 
poland also has demanded a role in the two plus four talks 
and on thursday government spokesman wolfgang meyer repeated east 
germanys agreement 
onethird of what is now poland belonged to germany before world 
war ii and the poles are concerned about possible german 
territorial claims 
in west germany zdf television quoted government spokesman 
dieter vogel as saying only the government of a united germany 
could give poland a guarantee of its borders he said poland would 
be consulted during the two plus four negotiations 
hoffmann explained the east german military proposals just 
before helmut kohl the west german chancellor visits the united 
states for weekend talks with president bush on reunification 
moscow insists that a united germany be neutral but the united 
states and the western allies want it in nato west german 
officials have proposed membership in the western alliance with no 
nato troops stationed in what now is east germany 
the east germans announced plans thursday for a law that would 
permit broad private ownership of industry and allow former owners 
to regain companies nationalized by the communist government ousted 
last year 
it reassured citizens there would be no food prices increases 
before the elections and said emergency action was being taken to 
ensure adequate supplies 
manfred flegel minister of trade and supply said the 
announcement of plans to abolish food subsidies had caused a 
fourfold increase in the demand for staples 
sueddeutsche zeitung a west german newspaper said premier hans 
modrow would not run in the east german election but andre brie 
campaign manager for the renamed communist party said no decision 
had been made

president bush promised thursday to help find 
ways to restore common sense and fairness to the medical 
malpractice system and urged physicians to provide more free care 
for the needy 
bush made the twin promise and appeal in a speech at the 
centennial celebration of one of americas premier medical schools 
the johns hopkins university 
despite devoting more than 11 percent of its gross national 
product to health care the biggest share of any country 
american medicine still faces unprecedented problems bush said 
he enumerated some of the maladies medical malpractice the 
plight of the 37 million americans with no health insurance the 
aids epidemic drug addiction an aging population and other 
conditions with staggering costs 
despite spending 600 billion a year on health care the united 
states trails other industrialized countries in life expectancy and 
ranks 22nd in the developed world in infant mortality the 
president said 
bush noted that he had instructed health secretary louis 
sullivan to lead a domestic policy council review of options on 
the accessibility cost and quality of americas healthcare system 
this administration is committed to healthcare policies that 
improve healthcare quality while restraining costs said bush 
some faculty and students were staging a protest against bushs 
being awarded an honorary doctorate of human letters from hopkins 
several hundred students and others gathered outside the hall 
where bush was speaking to protest the honorary degree they 
chanted health not stealth and george bush go away 
david dafashay a 19yearold sophomore from williamsburg va 
carried a sign reading dr bush get real 
he spends no money on housing for the poor and no money on a 
national healthcare plan its ridiculous dafashay said 
on wednesday dr philip zieve chief physician of the francis 
scott key medical center charged the bush administration with 
paying lip service to human needs while doing almost nothing 
to deal with the problems of homelessness and very little to deal 
with the problems of aids 
inside bush was joined on stage by more than two dozen eminent 
scientists also honored by the university including two nobel 
prize winners he joked that he didnt understand half the words in 
their citations but felt like the youth who put a rope around his 
mongrel and brought him to a pet show at madison square garden the 
lad didnt expect to win bush said but knew hed be in some 
fine company 
as for his administrations efforts to make better more 
affordable health care more accessible he said that 
heightened efforts to reduce infant mortality and expanded medicaid 
eligibility for women and infants are just two of the steps we 
are taking to help 
he said his administration is also proposing the largest 
biomedical research budget and the largest overall research budget 
in us history 
bush has proposed a 79 billion budget for the next fiscal year 
for the national institutes of health a 300 million increase over 
this year 
to keep american medicine the best in the world individual 
health care professionals and institutions must make our medical 
system responsive and responsible said bush urging the 
physicians to apply fiscal discipline to their own rising fees 
and i ask you today to avoid the understandable urge to 
practice defensive medicine where doctors fearing litigation too 
often dictate treatment that is unnecessary he said 
weve got to restore common sense and fairness to americas 
medical malpractice system bush said i have directed the 
domestic policy council to determine steps the federal government 
can take to help alleviate this serious situation 
he said americans must remember a simple truth not every 
unfortunate medical outcome is the result of poor medicine you 
cannot make life riskfree 
bush said the fear of malpractice has not only hurt medical 
innovation and treatment its also hurt medical volunteerism 
he reminded his audience many doctors used to give a day a 
week to the needy and im convinced that if not for the liability 
issue many more would donate time today 
he said the medical community has a special responsibility to 
reach out to those most in need 
hopkins receives more federal research money than any other 
university in excess of 500 million a year including 175 
million for biomedical research alone

president bushs proposal to slow the growth 
of medicare by 55 billion next year would hit hospitals too hard 
and should be rejected according to letters released thursday 
signed by a majority of the house and senate 
the overwhelming opposition means that the single biggest piece 
of deficit reduction in the presidents fiscal 1991 budget is in 
serious jeopardy 
the protest letters were not much of a surprise congress has 
been reluctant in recent years to make deep cuts in medicare which 
helps 33 million elderly and disabled people pay hospital and 
doctors bills 
signed by members of both parties and sent to the house and 
senate budget committees the two letters complained that hospitals 
are already under financial pressures 
cuts in the medicare program of the magnitude that the 
president is proposing can only make the situation worse and will 
pose a real threat to health care for the elderly and disabled 
said a letter to senate budget committee chairman james sasser 
dtenn signed by 51 senators 
a similar letter from 227 of the 435 house members to house 
budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif said bushs plan 
threatens to diminish both access to and quality of care 
medicare is one of the fastestgrowing federal programs it is 
expected to cost 104 billion this year about onetwelfth of the 
entire federal budget and grow to 183 billion by 1995 
in recent years lawmakers searching for ways to reduce the 
budget deficit have responded to pressures from hospitals doctors 
and elderly constituents and been reluctant to make deep medicare 
cuts 
last year bush proposed restraining medicare spending by 5 
billion congress eventually approved 28 billion in savings 
of the 37 billion in deficit cuts the president proposed in the 
1991 budget he released last month the largest piece was the 55 
billion in reduced medicare spending

here are excerpts from former president ronald 
reagans testimony as a defense witness in the irancontra trial of 
his former national security adviser john m poindexter 
the testimony begins with direct examination by poindexters 
lawyer richard w beckler 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
q well i take it there came a time well the first time 
on nov 13th 1986 you made an address to the nation this is 
about the iranian missile project 
a yes to to explain that we were not doing business with 
khomeini quite the contrary we were keeping it very secret from 
him what we were doing 
q then you also about six days later on november 19th you 
again went before the american public and had a press conference on 
that same subject six days later 
a in my memory there was a there was a second time and 
that was when the attorney general had located a paper which 
revealed that there had been more money than the twelve million two 
hundred thousand dollars that we had received and that it had 
been deposited in a swiss bank account and that that account had 
been used in some way by people helping the contras 
q between the nov 13th and the nov 19th addresses that 
you made to the nation did you receive information from admiral 
poindexter that enabled you to make those presentations to the 
public 
a i dont recall 
q the day before that november 12th you attended a 
meeting with congressional leaders and we understand that that was 
first to tell congress what was going on so to speak before you 
went to the public on that situation 
do you have any recollection of that meeting with congress 
a i know that someplace in there there were two meetings 
depending on the two various times that we corrected the story 
that i did meet with the congressional leadership members of both 
parties 
q do you recall just i am not asking you to be at all 
specific but do you recall generally what was discussed with 
congress at that meeting on november 12th 
a well it was mainly my explaining to them what the situation 
was and how it had come about 
q do you recall at that meeting whether or not you mentioned to 
the congressional leaders anything about this hawk missile shipment 
that had taken place back in the previous november of 1985 
a no i dont recall ever reporting that to anyone 
q mr president at some point do you recall admiral 
poindexter this is now in november of 1986 do you remember 
admiral poindexter telling you that people in the white house were 
having trouble remembering or some of those events in 1985 on the 
hawk missile shipment there were differing recollections of the 
events 
a no i dont recall hearing that 
q do you recall in 1986 meeting at all with attorney general 
edwin meese and asking him if he can lend a hand in straightening 
out the recollections of various people 
a no my memory of mr meeses participation was when after 
all of that thing had broken that he was the one who located a 
piece of paper in some office that indicated that there was 
additional money and that was his participation was as attorney 
general in case there was something untoward that was waiting there 
to haunt us and that was where i got the knowledge about the extra 
money and that is the only thing that i remember about from him 
q do you recall secretary of state shultz coming to you in 
november of 1986 this is in that nov 19thnov 20th time frame 
of 1986 and telling you about a hawk missile shipment that took 
place back in december of excuse me november of 1985 
a i dont recall that 
q now did there come a time mr president in 1984 early 
1984 when it looked like funds that congress had provided for 
contra support were running out do you recall that time frame 
a yes 
q do you recall what your instructions were to your top people 
at that time as to what ought to be done about this 
a yes my instructions were that whatever we did in trying to 
maintain the existence of the contras should be done within the 
law i emphasized that at every time 
and i knew that there were groups of citizens who were on the 
side of the contras and who were soliciting funds to be of help to 
the contras and i told them that maybe some of these citizens 
these people wouldnt know who to contact or how to contact the 
proper people to deliver the aid that they had raised for them and 
that i did not believe it was violating the law if our people who 
knew had the answer to those questions would tell them inform 
them as to how they could make contact 
but again i emphasized no solicitation we were not going to 
go out and try to solicit groups to do this and i suggested at the 
time that it wouldnt be against the law if we had an opportunity 
to mention to some of our democratic allies that they should have 
the same interest that we had with regard to the freedom fighters 
but again as i say always emphasized within the law 
but from the very beginning we all had to battle and fight to 
get any funding from congress for the freedom fighters and finally 
then they shut it off entirely

the recording academy 
now 40 miss raitt put out nine albums and was unsuccessfully 
nominated for grammys several times before she released nick of 
time last year 
and rather than a career peak the lp was a comeback from a 
mid80s plunge that included being dropped by her label warner

it was recorded first by singer gary morris 
well i thought thats pretty obscure maybe nobody bought 
that record miss midler said backstage and then it turned out 
after i recorded it that like a hundred people had recorded this 
song and it had never crossed over 
others who tried it before miss midler included willie nelson 
bj thomas perry como ray price judy collins and sheena easton 
in beaches the song underscored the theme of lifelong 
friendship between two women one of whom dies 
its the biggest record of my career she said i had a 
platinum record 1 million units on the rose but this went 
double platinum 
though the song is old the academys annual awards are for 
actual recordings released in an eligibility period which this time 
extended from oct 1 1988 to sept 30 1989 midlers version was 
released jan 13 1989 
song of the year grammys went to writers henley and silbar miss 
midler and longtime producer arif mardin shared the record of the 
year glory 
i think one of the most rewarding things about the song is 
that we got tremendous mail from people and there was a lot of 
inspirational letters like i was quarreling with my wife i wanted 
divorce we make up after hearing this song mardin said

americans who participated in the american revolution 
the memorial which would be the first on the washington mall

the patriots foundation the group promoting the memorial proposal 
the declaration of independence galvanized the struggle for 
freedom in america 
the national capital memorial commission on thursday unanimously 
approved the design for the memorial which is to be located on the 
mall near the reflecting pool midway between the lincoln memorial 
and the washington monument and not far from the vietnam war 
memorial 
although the memorial will refer only to the revolutionary war 
it will serve as a reminder barboza said of the contribution 
blacks made in the civil war and the vietnam war 
unveiled for the first time in model form thursday the memorial 
consists of 13 figures one for each of the original colonies in 
various roles black americans played during the revolution the

secretary of state james a baker iii set 
tough terms thursday for normalizing us relations with nicaragua 
if the sandinista government wins sundays election and reserved 
the right to determine if the contest is fair 
bakers testimony to the house foreign affairs committee means 
us hostility toward the nicaraguan government would not 
automatically end if the sandinistas triumph at the polls 
he said the united states would insist on a substantial period 
of good behaviorincluding an end to support for leftist 
insurgents in neighboring el salvador and reconciliation with 
domestic political opponents before ending economic sanctions and 
restoring full diplomatic relations 
the secretary accused the government of president daniel ortega 
of intimidating opponents and poll watchers besides denying visas 
to congressional observers 
the leading opposition group the united national opposition 
headed by violeta chamorro has received us aid in its bid to 
govern the country 
baker said that the unites states is prepared to recognize a 
government that wins a free election but he then set conditions 
that must be met for the restoration of normal relations and 
asserted us authority to judge the elections 
before we talk about normalizing relations if ortega is 
reelected we must see a sustained period of good behavior 
the government of the united states must be satisfied that 
there will continue to be open political space in nicaragua then 
we can consider beginning to look at how we might normalize 
relations including lifting the trade sanctions 
answering a question from rep gerry studds dmass baker 
said it seems to me that if you believe in democracy you believe 
in respecting the results of a free and fair election 
but he added the united states must reserve the right to make 
the judgment as to whether the election is free and fair 
observer groups including one led by former president carter 
and another sponsored by the united nations will assess the 
election and arrive at reasoned judgments about its fairness 
the secretary said but in light of experience the united 
states needs to make its own judgment 
the nicaraguan government in denying visas to congressional 
observers appointed by president bush argued that the observers 
could not be objective because the united states is providing money 
to the chamorro campaign 
while the united states has never broken relations and maintains 
an embassy in managua it is staffed by only a handful of american 
diplomats the last us ambassador was expelled in july 1988 
the reagan administration provided military aid to the contra 
rebels until congress suspended it in february 1988 the bush 
administration is using economic and diplomatic pressures against 
the sandinistas while holding to a trade embargo imposed in 1985 
in an hour of testimony before the house committee baker also 
credited the chinese government with freeing some political 
prisoners toning down its antius rhetoric and showing interest 
in receiving peace corps volunteers 
said the administration would consider holding negotiations to 
withdraw shortrange nuclear weapons from western europe if nato 
and the warsaw pact conclude a treaty to reduce troops and 
conventional arms 
the treaty now in negotiations in vienna would leave up to 
225000 american soldiers in western europe and 195000 soviet 
troops on foreign soil 
showed impatience with a lack of progress in starting 
negotiations between israel and palestinian arabs 
baker who meets on friday at the state department with israeli 
foreign minister moshe arens said 
we need action we have done a lot of talking the time for 
action is coming very close

police soldiers and tanks patrolled 
kosovo on thursday a day of strikes and school boycotts by ethnic 
albanians to protest alleged human rights violations in the poor 
southern province 
passive resistance continued despite harsh measures by federal 
authorities who imposed a nighttime curfew wednesday and deployed 
army units in an effort to quell unrest 
at least 28 ethnic albanians have been killed in outbursts of 
violence over the past month between police and residents demanding 
more autonomy for the province which adjoins albania and is 
yugoslavias poorest region 
the same number were reported killed a year ago when serbia made 
constitutional changes giving it nearly complete control over 
kosovo which had been an autonomous province within the serbian 
republic 
ethnic albanians most of whom are moslems make up 90 percent 
of kosovos 19 million people outnumbered slavs predominantly 
christian claim they are harassed by the majority 
no large protests were reported thursday but thousands of 
ethnic albanians continued strikes and school boycotts to protest 
the state of virtual martial law 
a joint statement by the seven unofficial organizations of 
ethnic albanians issued in pristina the provincial capital 
denounced alleged police brutality 
police are storming schools hospitals houses churches and 
mosques where they intimidate loot and beat up people it said 
the charges could not be confirmed 
the statement asked ethnic albanians to stop street protests 
because it would lead to more repression by the authorities 
and appealed for a discussion of solutions by all democratic 
forces in serbia 
serbian authorities and the serbs in kosovo have rejected 
dialogue with ethnic albanian groups describing their leaders as 
hostile elements who should be jailed 
serbia says it needs control of the province to prevent 
persecution of the slavic minority they say albanian terrorists 
and separatists want to secede from yugoslavia and make kosovo 
part of albania 
police in bulletproof vests patrolled towns in the province 
thursday aided by army tanks and armored vihicles 
in belgrade the federal government said the measures taken in 
the province have as their purpose the creation of the necessary 
preconditions to enable talks to begin on a political solution 
of the problems in kosovo the official news agency tanjug 
reported 
such a dialogue is indispensable in order to thwart efforts of 
separatist forces a government statement said

business executives and a bush administration 
official said thursday that a national product liability law is 
essential to us competitiveness in the world market 
if we are serious about addressing our nations 
competitiveness we must address the excessive burdens placed on 
american business by our current liability system said wendell 
wilkie ii general counsel for the commerce department 
a federal product liability law would make the rules for doing 
business clear consistent uniform and predictable wilkie 
said in testimony before the senate commerce consumer subcommittee 
state laws are more burdensome and unpredictable than those in 
any of our other trading partners he added 
senator robert kasten rwis author of a bill to establish a 
national law said member nations of the european economic 
community already had adopted uniform product liability guidelines 
which would increase their advantage in global markets 
were going to be in a position very quickly in which germany 
france and england are going to have uniform laws while wisconsin 
minnesota and illinois are going to be further apart kasten said 
kastens bill would create a uniform standard for imposing 
punitive damages in product liability lawsuits and estblish a 
twoyear statute of limitations for most product liability claims 
claims by workers injured by durable goods such as factory 
machinery would have a 25year statute of limitations 
the measure would allow separate trials or settlements of 
punitive damages and compensatory damages and allow companies to 
pay damages in proportion to their responsibility for harm 
businessmen howard fark and robert c holland said change was 
needed in the current system to stop the rapid rise in business 
insurance costs 
wilkie said a uniform law also would reduce transaction 
costs attorneys fees damage awards and other court costs 
associated with lawsuits involving potentially dangerous products 
but commerce committee chairman ernest hollings dsc blamed 
businesses for the rise in insurance and legal costs and challenged 
the need for federal intervention in product liability 
others including vincent l mckusick chief judge of the maine 
supreme court and michael box an alabama state representative 
argued that the federal government should aid state enforcement 
instead of tinkering unnecessarily with state law 
hollings cited a 1989 congressional study that showed about 
half the plaintiffs attorneys received no fee 
the study by the general accounting office also found that most 
punitive damages are overturned on appeal said hollings adding 
this goes to the heart of transaction costs 
the gao reviewed court records of 305 product liability cases 
resolved in trials from 198385 in arizona massachusetts 
missouri north dakota and south carolina 
proponents acknowledge the kasten bill might not directly reduce 
transaction costs but said the bill would encourage faster 
resolution of disputes because it requires that lawyers who refuse 
reasonable outof court settlements must pay all attorneys fees 
congress has attempted to develop a federal product liability 
law since the 1970s and president bush made it an administration 
legislative priority in his state of the union address last month

a state trooper who was summoned to the 
grounded exxon valdez to deal with an allegedly drunken skipper 
testified thursday that when he arrived capt joseph hazelwood 
didnt seem impaired 
the trooper michael j fox said at hazelwoods criminal trial 
that coast guard officials told him the captain was drunk and 
they wanted me to take care of it he assumed they needed help 
wrestling this drunk off the tanker 
but when he arrived aboard a coast guard boat at the scene of 
the nations worst oil spill fox said the situation wasnt as he 
expected 
when i got there i was expecting a brawl fox testified 
but it was kind of quiet and dark and everyone was gazing out the 
windows 
he said he asked hazelwood what was the problem it was then he 
said that hazelwood referred to himself in the muchquoted 
comment youre looking at it 
the skipper didnt seem drunk or impaired in any way the 
trooper testified 
he had bloodshot eyes and was smoking cigarettes fox 
recalled i didnt notice any alcohol he had morning breath bad 
breath he seemed unimpaired 
the 43yearold hazelwood of huntington ny is charged in 
state court with seconddegree criminal mischief a felony and 
three misdemeanors reckless endangerment operating a vessel while 
intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil 
the exxon valdez leaked nearly 11 million gallons of alaskan 
crude oil which blackened hundreds of miles of rocky coastline and 
killed countless birds fish and wildlife exxon has spent some 2 
billion trying to clean up the mess 
also thursday a coast guard officers testimony that he smelled 
alcohol on hazelwoods breath was challenged on the basis of 
remarks the witness made earlier in a television interview 
jurors were shown a tape of a cbs interview by connie chung who 
asked lt cmdr thomas falkenstein if he smelled alcohol on 
hazelwoods breath shortly after the tanker grounded 
i never talked to him facetoface like were talking it was 
sidebyside and staring out at the pilot house across the deck we 
were close 2 feet and i smelled alcohol in and around the 
area falkenstein said on the television broadcast 
falkenstein testified in the trial that he detected alcohol on 
the skippers breath 
the prosecutor deputy district attorney brent cole who has 
been trying to prove hazelwood had been drinking asked if there 
was anyone else present in the area when falkenstein smelled 
liquor he said there wasnt 
hazelwoods attorney michael chalos asked if the captain 
appeared impaired or intoxicated 
that was the first time i had met captain hazelwood said 
the witness i saw no signs of impairment 
falkenstein who is executive officer of the coast guards 
marine safety office in valdez was questioned at length about a 
key issue whether the exxon valdez was required to have an 
officer on the bridge with a pilots license for prince william 
sound 
he said federal regulations required that a certified officer 
directly control the ship but the regulations were eased twice 
after the opening of the alaska pipeline in the late 1970s 
ultimately they permitted a ship to cross the area without a 
licensed pilot if visibility was two miles or more falkenstein 
said 
hazelwood was the only officer on board with such a license when 
the accident occurred and he wasnt on the bridge

manuel antonio noriega writing to 
teenage students from a florida jail cell claimed that thousands 
of innocent panamanians were killed by the us invaders of his 
country last december school officials said 
that was the christian christmas that the troops and 
government of your country gave to a small country of 2 million 
people says a letter apparently signed by the deposed panamanian 
leader

dated dec 31 and postmarked miami the letter condemns the united 
states for killing thousands of children men women old people 
and people from the army innocents in my country on dec 20

students at suzanne middle school in walnut 25 miles east of 
downtown los angeles 
its really wild for the kids for the first time in their 
lives theyre in contact with someone in the news so theyre in 
shock but theyre starting to feel good about it teacher alan 
haskvitz said thursday 
haskvitz said he didnt attempt to authenticate the letter that 
arrived tuesday but he believes it is genuine because the tone 
of the letter sounds like him 
noriega who surrendered to us forces jan 3 is held at the 
metropolitan correctional center in dade county fla his march 5 
trial date on drug conspiracy charges has been delayed indefinitely 
calls to the jail and noriegas attorneys to confirm he sent the 
letter werent immediately returned thursday defense attorneys

an army officer told a military court thursday 
that soldiers often beat palestinian detainees in violation of 
orders israel radio said 
the testimony by lt col ephraim fein came a day after the us 
state department released a report saying israeli soldiers often 
ignored regulations and many unauthorized killings by soldiers went 
unpunished 
fein former commander of the elite givati brigade testified in 
the trial of four givati reserve soldiers accused of beating two 
palestinian detainees in the occupied gaza strip in february 1988 
one detainee later died 
a defense attorney also cited previous testimony as saying that 
gen yitzhak mordechai at that time the army chief in the gaza 
strip beat a palestinian who refused orders to clear a stone 
roadblock mordechai is now chief of the armys central command 
which includes the occupied west bank 
at least 13 palestinian teenagers were wounded by army gunfire 
thursday in scattered clashes in the occupied lands hospital 
officials said they said a 15yearold girl was shot in the leg 
while trying to stop soldiers from beating her brother during an 
army raid in qalqilya 
the army confirmed that six arabs were wounded in the gaza strip 
and said it was checking the other reports 
at least 658 palestinians have been killed by israeli soldiers 
or civilians in the revolt now in its 27th month fortythree 
israelis have died and more than 180 palestinians have been slain 
by their fellow arabs most as suspected collaborators 
the givati trial revived debate in israel over army policy of 
beating palestinian suspects in the occupied lands beatings became 
widespread after defense minister yitzhak rabin in january 1988 
authorized soldiers to beat palestinians during violent 
demonstrations 
fein who testified for the prosecution told the court that at 
the time of the beatings at the center of the case his soldiers 
were in a situation close to war 
the orders were changed and eroded to keep up with the fast 
pace of events he said 
fein also recalled an incident in which he himself violated 
orders on beatings 
when they soldiers arrested an arab they bound his hands 
and feet and blindfolded him one soldier helped him get down from 
the jeep and he spit at the soldier i slapped the arab in an 
instinctive reaction the radio quoted fein as saying 
the army said thursday it had captured three palestinian 
fugitives in the west bank wanted for attacks on israeli targets 
they also allegedly killed two arabs suspected of collaborating 
with israeli authorities 
a military commander interviewed on israel tv said the three 
were involved in the public execution feb 16 of an alleged 
informer who was hacked to death while hundreds watched

the former president of wedtech corp whose 
testimony helped convict a congressman and a friend of exus 
attorney general edwin meese iii was sentenced thursday to five 
months in prison for his role in the corruption scandal 
anthony guariglia was one of four officials of the new yorkarea 
military contractor who pleaded guilty in 1987 to federal charge of 
conspiracy to commit bribery and conspiracy to commit mail fraud 
guariglia testified at the racketeering trials of former us 
rep mario biaggi and e robert wallach the san francisco attorney 
who is a close associate of meese both were convicted of receiving 
illegal payments from wedtech officials 
this wedtech scandal has certainly been a disgrace to this 
great country guariglia said to us district judge charles e 
stewart he said he was remorseful and ashamed of his actions 
stewart sentenced guariglia to five months in prison and three 
years probation he also ordered the defendant to get counseling 
for a gambling addiction 
the judge said guariglia could subtract from the prison sentence 
the time he served since last month when prosecutors revealed that 
he had violated his cooperation agreement by lying on the witness 
stand at wallachs trial 
assistant us attorney baruch weiss said guariglia admitted he 
lied when he testified he hadnt gambled which would have violated 
a court order guariglia had actually incurred a 17000 gambling 
debt at a puerto rican casino in late 1988 weiss said 
the perjury issue has prompted a request by wallachs attorneys 
for a new trial 
gary naftalis a wallach attorney said a motion was filed 
earlier this month with the 2nd us circuit court of appeals 
asking that the case be returned to the trial judge so he can 
consider granting a new trial wallachs attorneys are seeking a 
hearing on the scope of guariglias perjury 
obviously it seems plain to us that wallach should not be 
convicted based on testimony of an admitted perjurer naftalis 
said in a telephone interview it undermines the integrity of the 
entire prosecution 
wallach was convicted in august after a fourmonth trial of 
illegally receiving 425000 from wedtech to influence meese and 
other government officials as part of wedtechs efforts to gain 
government business the company went bankrupt in 1986 after 
allegations of corruption were made public 
wallach was sentenced to six years in prison for his 
racketeering conviction but is free pending appeal which is being 
handled by a group of attorneys that includes robert bork the 
former us supreme court nominee 
guariglia was the last of the four wedtech officials who 
cooperated to be sentenced the others are former wedtech vice 
chairman mario moreno sentenced to 18 months in prison wedtech 
cofounder fred neuberger sentenced to two years and three months 
in prison and larry shorten a wedtech financial official who 
received probation

efforts to block confirmation of conservative 
civil rights official clarence thomas as an appeals judge largely 
dried up thursday as a senate panel voted to send his nomination to 
the floor for final action 
his capacity and competence i think are beyond attack 
chairman joseph r biden jr ddel said as the senate judiciary 
committee voted 121 in favor of the nomination 
critics conceded afterward that the full senate was all but 
guaranteed to confirm thomas who as chairman of the equal 
employment opportunity commission over the last eight years was one 
of the most visible blacks in the reagan administration 
only sen howard m metzenbaum dohio among committee members 
voted against sending the nomination to the floor 
just weeks ago conservative supporters of thomas and civil 
rights forces were digging in for a fight with senior citizens 
groups complaining that the commission has allowed thousands of 
agebias cases to expire without action 
thomas said that state fairemployment commissions were to blame 
but thomas came in for renewed criticism late thursday as sen 
david pryor dark inserted a statement in the congressional 
record complaining that several thousand agediscrimination 
claimants during chairman thomas watch lost their rights largely 
due to eeoc neglect and mismanagement 
pryor chairman of the senate aging committee said many answers 
that thomas gave senators who asked about the problem at his 
confirmation hearing appeared to be shaky attempts at revisionist 
history pryor said he had not yet decided how to vote on 
confirmation 
an underlying concern among congressional liberals clearly was 
speculation that within a few years thomas could be ripe for 
advancement to the supreme court i have some concerns about this 
man in terms of whether i could support him for the supreme 
court sen herb kohl dwis declared 
sen paul simon dill also said he might view a thomas 
nomination for the supreme court in a different light biden said 
that standards for a supreme court justice are higher than those 
for the appeals bench 
thomas is under consideration for the vacancy left by the 
resignation of robert bork from the us court of appeals for the 
district of columbia bork resigned after the senate rejected him 
for the supreme court at the close of the most embittered 
confirmation fight in decades 
thomas who climbed from an impoverished childhood in rural 
georgia to graduation from yale law school is an outspoken critic 
of racial hiring quotas and affirmative action programs civil 
rights forces have long been cool to him because of these views 
steam drained out of efforts to block his confirmation however 
when benjamin hooks head of the national association for the 
advancement of colored people said two weeks ago that he would not 
take part in the effort 
the alliance for justice a liberal courtwatcher group that was 
among the severest critics of the nomination issued a statement 
after committee action saying it was clear that senators hold 
grave doubts about the nominees qualifications it said his 
performance on the bench will be watched carefully to determine 
whether he is truly committed to the rule of law 
metzenbaum a leading congressional liberal told the committee 
he had initially expected to vote to confirm thomas but changed his 
mind at the confirmation hearing when thomas blamed state fair 
employment agencies for problems involving numerous 
agediscrimination cases in these cases the statute of 
limitations for action expired before the complaints were processed 
i was flabbergasted that he did not know that the state 
agencies are under contract to process state agediscrimination 
claims metzenbaum said he said the federal commission is 
responsible for enforcing the contract and regulating the actions 
of the state agencies

ronald reagans videotaped deposition gave 
irancontra prosecutors new ammunition for the trial of john m 
poindexter even though the former president tried hard to help his 
former national security adviser 
reagan endorsed the truthfulness of a letter poindexter wrote to 
congress assuring lawmakers that white house aides were not helping 
the nicaraguan rebels in violation of a congressional ban 
the former president who winked and nodded at poindexter when 
he took the witness stand said he was in total agreement with 
the letter and hadnt authorized anything but the truth 
but irancontra prosecutors charge the letter was a false 
statement to congress and if they can convince poindexters jury 
of that reagans statements about what he did or didnt authorize 
could be a problem for his former aide 
prosecutor dan webb said to reagan concerning the truthfulness 
of the letter you do understand that is a matter that ultimately 
the jury will have an opportunity to determine in this case dont 
you 
us district judge harold greene ordered that remark stricken 
from the record but the jury in poindexters case will in all 
likelihood face that question 
part of poindexters defense as outlined in court papers is 
that he had no reason to lie to congress because his activities 
were authorized by the president 
but reagan during crossexamination by webb said he never 
authorized poindexter to lie to congress about the irancontra 
affair 
at any time did you ever approve or give authority to john 
poindexter to make any false or misleading statements to any 
congressional committee regarding events related to the irancontra 
controversy webb asked 
no and i dont think any false statements were made reagan 
said again trying to defend poindexter 
during the videotaped deposition taken last week in los angeles 
and shown thursday in washington reagan testified that members of 
the national security council staff were in contact with the 
nicaraguan contras during the congressional ban on direct us 
military aid 
but during crossexamination reagan said he never had any 
inkling that poindexters aide oliver north was helping devise 
military strategy for the contras 
the former president contended that there was no diversion of 
usiran arms sale proceeds to the rebels until webb confronted 
him with details of such a diversion in the report of the 
commission reagan appointed to investigate the irancontra affair 
to the extent that there was in fact a diversion of proceeds 
did you in any way approve or authorize that while you were 
president of the united states 
for heavens sake no reagan replied 
michael bromwich who was on the irancontra prosecution team in 
norths trial said that reagans lack of knowledge about north and 
poindexters activities could be damaging for the defense 
reagan seems to have very little idea of what was going on so 
he certainly didnt authorize or approve of what north or 
poindexter was doing doing based on full knowledge of the facts 
said bromwich now a washington lawyer 
reagans statements could help prosecutors contend that the 
former president was deceived by the man he entrusted to advise him 
on the most sensitive matters of government 
at one point reagan said he couldnt recall which government 
official told him that a c123 transport plane shot down over 
nicaragua was not connected with the us government 
but webb showed reagan the written answers he gave to the 
irancontra grand jury in which the former president stated that 
poindexter had told him that the crashs sole survivor eugene 
hasenfus was not part of the covert resupply operation run by north 
hasenfus involvement in the secret resupply efforts is well 
documented and the prosecutors could argue to jurors that 
poindexter lied about this to reagan 
rep lee hamilton dind who was a recipient of one of 
poindexters letters when he chaired the house intelligence 
committee said reagans testimony takes away one of the defenses 
that admiral poindexter was asserting 
that defense was that he was specifically authorized to do 
what he did hamilton said 
hamilton said he expects the defense will rely more on the 
notion that the president created a certain environment or 
climate in the white house that gave the signal or the impression 
to admiral poindexter that he could do what he did

president vaclav havel of czechoslovakia 
told secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar on thursday his 
newly democractic nation intends to be more active in the united 
nations 
at the end of his first official visit to the united states he 
told reporters czechoslovakia does not seek a role in negotiations 
on german reunification but understands polands desire to 
participate in talks that could affect its borders 
onethird of what is now poland was in germany before world war 
ii and the poles are worried about possible territorial claims by a 
united germany 
havel a dissident playwright who often was jailed by the 
communist regime that collapesd last year evaded a question about 
his talks with president bush and whether the administration 
rebuffed his governments request for reduced levels of us and 
nato troops in europe 
this question has been raised in my conversation with mr bush 
and it came out that we understand each other better than before 
he said 
czechoslovakia also is negotiating with the soviet union for 
withdrawal of the 75000 red army soldiers stationed in 
czechoslovakia 
later prime minister marian calfa told the news conference 
we do regard the presence of us troops in europe as a 
stabilizing factor 
we believe european stability should not depend so much on 
military forces and we should seek a security system that could 
replace the current forms a new system so that the presence 
of any foreign troops on the territory of any country would be 
unnecessary 
calfa said the united nations can play a major role in 
international relations but emphasized it is much more 
important that we play a more substantial role in the un than we 
have played until now 
havel spoke in the same vein earlier to perez de cuellar and 
said czechoslovakia was eager to pursue a more active and 
independent course in the world 
he and havel spoke in czech and their comments were translated 
by an interpreter

a top election observer said thursday 
that a fair vote is possible this weekend despite charges of 
planned fraud or violence by both the ruling sandinistas and their 
opponents 
i ask that all nicaraguans be allowed to exercise their right 
to vote peacefully on sunday joao baena soares 
secretarygeneral of the organization of american states said at a 
news conference 
he specifically asked those involved in military activities 
both the sandinista army and the usbacked contra guerrillas 
not to interfere 
the campaigning has halted for a threeday coolingoff period 
president daniel ortega told a news conference that the huge 
crowd that greeted his closing speech wednesday night was a sure 
sign of victory 
violeta barrios de chamorro ortegas major rival countered 
that ortega made a desperate speech without foundations full of 
tired rhetoric 
she told a lunch in her honor that the sandinistas had tried to 
split her united national opposition but the 14party coalitions 
maturity prevailed 
mrs chamorro and her running mate virgilio godoy said they 
expected to win sundays election despite the turnout wednesday of 
300000 supporters for ortega a huge showing in a country with 
175 million registered voters 
she noted that the sandinistas had brought in supporters from 
towns and cities for miles around and said that many were too young 
to vote although that was not apparent to other observers 
ortega appeared determined to strike a statesmanlike note at his 
news conference especially regarding the united states more than 
400 journalists were in attendance 
us secretary of state james baker iii told the house foreign 
affairs committee thursday that even if the sandinistas win a fair 
vote relations would not be normalized until we see a 
substantial period of good behavior including a halt to support 
for leftist rebels in el salvador 
asked if he thought baker was setting new conditions ortega 
said he expected to be able to negotiate security and other issues 
with the united states after the election 
ortega was asked five times if nicaragua would promise to halt 
aid to el salvadors guerrillas but he said only that a regional 
agreement exists calling for suspension of aid he said the united 
states should stop helping the contras before pointing a finger at 
someone else 
asked if the sandinistas would give up power if they lost 
sundays vote ortega said his party would respect the will of 
the people but that a political defeat does not transfer total 
power to the victors 
the issue has become a point of contention because senior 
sandinista officials have said they would not yield control of the 
army and police if they lose 
ortega said the question was conceptual in any case 
hypothetically there is no chance of an electoral victory for 
any other party in nicaragua he said 
ortega hopes to force the united states to help disband the 
contras and normalize relations with a victory certified by 
international observers but baker said the united states would not 
necessarily accept the observers word 
baena soares became indignant when asked if the oas was favoring 
the sandinistas 
he said nobody had made that accusation and that the observers 
would maintain our integrity our impartiality and above all our 
independence 
the conditions exist for a fair election said soares who 
heads a contingent of more than 400 observers 
one of them former us attorney general elliot richardson 
toured provincial election centers in northern nicaragua 
cardinal manuel obando y bravo told reporters the sandinistas 
have changed during the electoral campaign i would like to 
interpret that as a permanent change the roman catholic prelate 
often has leaned toward the government 
obando said he would vote sunday for the first time in his life 
because after years of civil war we must make an effort to 
resolve our problems through civilized methods 
he refused to reveal his choice but added if nicaragua does 
not put an end to violence violence will put an end to nicaragua

at least 23 million americans will suffer from 
severe debilitating dementia such as alzheimers disease by the 
close of this decade federal health officials predicted thursday 
a california study meanwhile finds that two out of three 
alzheimers patients are women and one in four is under 65 
as the us population ages the public health impact of 
dementias is increasing in importance the centers for disease 
control said in its weekly report an estimated 16 million 
americans currently suffer from severe dementia most often 
alzheimers disease but also some with parkinsons disease 
huntingtons chorea or dementiainducing strokes cdc researchers 
reported 
by the year 2000 at least 23 million persons are expected to 
be affected the atlantabased agency said 
the estimated annual cost of care and related expenses for 
patients with severe dementia in 1985 was as much as 48 billion 
the cdc said 
alzheimers disease is a progressive brain disorder marked by 
dementia an inability to remember reason or understand what is 
going on the cause is unknown and no cure is available 
a survey of 439 patients with alzheimers at six california 
treatment centers from 198587 showed that 298 or 68 percent were 
women according to data from the institute for aging at the 
university of california at san francisco 
while the california patients do not represent an accurate 
national survey alzheimers is more frequent in women than in men 
said dr charles helmick a cdc alzheimers expert 
and while the disease is often regarded as an affliction of the 
very old 106 of the california patients or 24 percent were 
under 65 
its been recognized it can occur in middle age helmick 
said its more prevalent among the older population and age is 
certainly a risk factor but there are people in middle age 
affected by this 
the largest numbers of alzheimers patients in the california 
study were in their 70s ages of patients ranged from 45 to 92 
most of the california patients 66 percent were referred to 
the special treatment centers by family members most often because 
of an obvious memory problem

the communist party has expelled two special 
investigators who earned national fame for their role in a 
corruption inquiry in the central asian republic of uzbekistan one 
of the investigators said thursday 
telman gdlyan said he and and nikolai ivanov had been expelled 
by a majority vote of moscow party officials of their local party 
cell at a meeting at the general prosecutors office wednesday 
the two investigators were expelled on charges of violating the 
law and for their political activities gdlyan said by telephone 
thursday 
gdlyan and ivanov spearheaded an investigation into corruption 
in uzbekistan and won their elections last year to the national 
parliament partly on the popularity of their investigation that 
reached the politburo particularly conservative member yegor k 
ligachev 
ivanov in may alleged that ligachev had accepted a bribe but 
for months afterward a prosecutor said the investigation proved 
the allegations were untrue 
however the general prosecutors office after an eightmonth 
inquiry accused the two investigators of forcing confessions and 
other improprieties 
in recent weeks small groups of citizens have been 
demonstrating sporadically near red square on behalf of the two 
investigators accusing the party of persecuting the two men 
gdlyan said the general prosecutor had provided no charges 
against him and ivanov and that he believed he had been expelled 
from the party in order to destroy efforts to investigate 
corruption within the communist party

cluster of placards whose slogans included hurrah prince 
charles and humane architecture happy people 
he saw the sign shining knight in armor and he said gee 
whiz said thomas j eyerman a member of the board of regents of 
the american architectural foundation one of the sponsors of the 
event 
he was absolutely shocked that in america that people would 
have signs talking about architecture calling him a shining knight 
in armor eyerman said 
the proprince demonstrators told reporters they represented 
organizations that fought a long and ultimately unsuccessful fight 
to save washingtons historic rhodes tavern from demolition 
the princes objective at octagon house used as a temporary 
executive mansion by president james madison after the british army 
burned the white house in 1814 was to view an exhibit

institute of architects charles married his wife diana in st 
pauls in 1981 
the prince reacted to the layout of architectural renderings and 
models with animation looking at each exhibit closely pointing 
out details and asking questions of one of his guides eric evans 
dean of st pauls 
the works on display have never before been assembled as a unit 
and the prince was quoted by architects with whom he spoke as 
hoping they also could be shown in london

banquet for 1200 architects members of congress diplomats 
supreme court justices and hollywood celebrities at the national

his audience to design more attractive comfortable buildings that 
are scaled to human needs and respect the surrounding landscape 
back home charles has angered some architects but won the 
applause of much of the british public with his contention that the 
london skyline has suffered more damage from architects city 
planners and developers than from german bombers in world war ii 
in a vision of britain a book he published last year

monsters devoid of character alien and largely unloved he says 
some new buildings in london remind him of word processors or 
nuclear power plants

an operative in oliver norths secret supply 
network to the nicaraguan contras was indicted thursday on charges 
of failing to report some of his income from arms sales 
the indictment says that thomas g clines 61 a business 
partner of irancontra figures richard secord and albert hakim 
reported receipts of 265000 for tax year 1985 and 402513 for 
1986 from the arms business and other income sources 
however the fourcount indictment returned by a federal grand 
jury in baltimore alleges that clines failed to report to the 
internal revenue service that he had foreign accounts totaling more 
than 10000 
two counts of the indictment accuse him of underreporting the 
gross receipts each count carries a maximum penalty of three years 
imprisonment and 100000 in fines on conviction 
the other counts accuse clines of failing to report his foreign 
accounts with maximum penalties on conviction for each charge of 
10 years in prison and 500000 in fines 
during the period in question hakim set aside more than 
972000 in commissions for clines who is a former cia agent in 
an offshore entity codenamed c tea according to a congressional 
report on the irancontra scandal issued in 1987 
clines and his lawyer regard the decision to bring the case as 
an illadvised step taken by overzealous prosecutors said 
his attorney paula junghans clines intends to defend himself to 
the fullest she added 
sources familiar with the matter say clines filed an amended tax 
return for 1985 in the fall of 1987 nearly a year after the 
irancontra affair came into public view reporting additional 
expenses and additional income 
clines takes the position that he has reported all his income 
from the contra transactions say sources familiar with clines 
situation 
he collected the money in connection with his work for the 
enterprise the complex of foreign corporations and swiss 
accounts which hakim and secord used to move money in the 
irancontra affair 
hakim is a key witness in the investigation of clines according 
to other sources familiar with the investigation hakim was placed 
on two years probation and fined 5000 on feb 1 for his role in 
the irancontra affair 
at the request of his friend secord clines helped procure arms 
for the contra rebels starting in 1985 in addition to locating a 
european arms dealer as a source of weapons clines helped arrange 
for shipping and lined up crews to transport the supplies to the 
rebels 
clines worked for the cia for 30 years he was an agent in 
southeast asia was involved in the bay of pigs invasion in cuba 
and became director of training in the directorate of operations 
also known as the clandestine services 
he also was a close associate of edwin wilson the former cia 
agent who is serving 52 years in federal prison for illegally 
selling guns and explosives to libya 
clines pleaded guilty in 1984 on behalf of his wholly owned 
company to inflating bills submitted to the defense department for 
shipping us military equipment to egypt he was fined the maximum 
10000 and paid the government 100000 on behalf of his firm

israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir told 
president bush on thursday that the israeli government is not 
directing new soviet immigrants into occupied lands bushs 
spokesman said 
shamirs comments in a morning phone call to bush seemed 
designed to allay us concerns that stepped up settlement of 
soviet jews in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza could 
torpedo fragile peace efforts 
the prime minister stated that jewish immigration into israel 
was a separate matter from the question of settlements and that 
the israeli government had no policy of directing where the new 
immigrants would live said bushs press secretary marlin 
fitzwater 
at the same time fitzwater said in a statement bush 
reiterated us opposition to any settlement activity 
the united states opposes any expansion of settlements in the 
territories israel seized in the 1967 arabisraeli war 
the shamirbush call came as the israeli foreign minister moshe 
arens arrived in washington for a meeting with secretary of state 
james a baker iii on friday to discuss prospects for mideast peace 
negotiations 
baker has tried for months to arrange a threeway session in 
washington with arens and egyptian foreign minister esmat 
abdelmeguid it would be followed by talks between israel and 
palestinian arabs 
but baker told the house foreign affairs committee that the 
agenda and the composition of a palestinian delegation remained 
unsettled 
the time for action is coming very very close baker said 
meanwhile shimon peres the israeli finance minister told 
cable news network that the palestine liberation organization has 
accepted a formula for a palestinian delegation 
peres who heads israels opposition labor party said it would 
be a nonplo delegation including one or two palestinians who were 
expelled from israel and one or two who reside in east jerusalem 
israel has refused to negotiate with the plo 
earlier this week fitzwater said the administration did not 
believe that encouraging soviet emigrants to settle there is 
helpful to the peace process 
despite shamirs denial of any such policy the soviet union 
decided this week against allowing direct flights to israel 
largely because of arab concerns over the settling of soviet jews 
in occupied lands 
in his phone conversation shamir thanked the president for 
us support of jewish emigration from the soviet union for 
opposing antisemitism and for supporting the restoration of 
diplomatic relations as well as the establishment of direct flights 
between the ussr and israel fitzwaters statement said 
bush thanked the prime minister for his statement and said 
that the united states would continue to support free emigration 
from the soviet union the statement added 
the president also told shamir he hoped the peace process 
could move forward to pave the way for a proposed meeting soon in 
cairo of israeli and palestinian peace negotiators 
using standing diplomatic language fitzwaters statement said 
shamirs call was described by both leaders as helpful and 
constructive

union oil agreed thursday to a 555 
million court settlement stemming from the pollution of san pablo 
bay in what lawyers called the largest civil penalty in the 
history of the federal clean water act 
the settlement resolves a longstanding dispute over pollution 
that environmentalists contended took place between april 1979 and 
february 1988 in the bay which is located about 15 miles northeast 
of here and is part of san francisco bay 
were elated said attorney stephan volker of the sierra 
club legal defense fund inc volker who filed suit against the 
company in 1984 credited the litigation with exposing and halting 
systematic manipulation of the selfmonitoring program on which 
the clean water act is based 
this should send a strong message to other polluters clean up 
your operations or face the prospect of being hauled into court and 
paying a substantial penalty volker said 
john barg the attorney handling the case for union which has 
been acquired by unocal declined to comment on the settlement 
unocal spokesman jeff callender emphasized that the settlement did 
not constitute an admission of fault 
the company maintains that many of the alleged violations are 
the result of misunderstandings regarding provisions of the clean 
water act he said 
we remained confident of our position but the case has dragged 
on for six years and we felt it was time to put it behind us 
callender said 
union oil employees testified during the dispute that the 
company repeatedly and deliberately violated the terms of its waste 
water discharge permit and failed to report the violations volker 
said 
the settlement followed years of legal battles although the 
courts initially found in favor of unions position subsequent 
rulings went against the company 
in december 1988 us district court judge samuel conti ruled 
that union oil had violated its federal waste discharge permit 200 
times including nine bypasses of its treatment plant in the town 
of rodeo a trial had been scheduled for this month 
the wastes that flowed into the bay included phenols and other 
potentially cancercausing substances such as benzene toluene 
acetone and trichloroethylene conti said the company had saved 
from 20 million to 60 million by failing to install adequate 
treatment equipment 
the penalty was described by the sierra club legal defense fund 
as the highest ever paid as the result of a civil lawsuit under the 
federal clean water act the previous high was 32 million awarded 
in a new jersey case last year 
the settlement includes 272 million that unocal will give the 
trust for public land for acquisition and restoration of wetlands 
around san francisco bay 1 million to the environmental 
protection agency to study the removal of dredge spoils from the 
san francisco bay 500000 to the state of california water 
pollution cleanup and abatement fund for emergency pollution 
cleanup and 133 million in scldf court costs 
state attorney general john van de kamp whose office 
participated in the litigation hailed the settlement 
californias strict water quality law was enacted precisely to 
prevent this type of environmental abuse he said our evidence 
showed that unocal repeatedly disregarded this law both by numerous 
waste discharge violations and by failing to report them as 
required 
the company spent 64 million last year to upgrade its 
wastewater treatment facilities in the contra costa county town of 
rodeo callender said

an unmanned ariane 44l rocket with 
two japanese telecommunications satellites aboard exploded shortly 
after blasting off thursday from the ariane space center 
the fourengine rocket blew up because of what appeared to be a 
fire in the propulsion system but the precise cause was not 
immediately clear arianespace president frederic dallest said 
he said all ariane flights were being suspended until the cause 
of the accident was determined 
the failure came after 17 straight successful launches of the 
ariane the two satellites alone were insured for nearly 240 
million 
an associated press reporter and other witnesses who saw the 
flight on tv monitors at the agencys headquarters in evry france 
said flames appeared to break out in the first stage of the rocket 
before it was due to separate at two minutes 30 seconds into 
flight 
they also said that flames from one rocket booster unexpectedly 
burned into the scaffolding supporting the vehicle as it lifted 
off but there was no indication this had any bearing on the 
explosion 
a mishap in the function of the first stage led to the loss of 
mission flight 36 one minute 40 seconds into launch 
arianespace said in a statement released in paris 
the rocket exploded about 62 miles from the launch pad at an 
altitude of 56 miles the statement said 
we are going to analyze the failure as rapidly as 
possible said dallest 
arianespace a consortium of european companies took over the 
commercialization of the ariane program from the european space 
agency in 1980 it is responsible for building operating and 
marketing launch services 
ariane shots have become routine with successful missions about 
once a month the reliability of the program has made arianespace 
the worlds leading provider of commercial launch services holding 
more than 50 percent of the lucrative international market 
the french space minister paul quilles said the explosion 
should not cast doubt on the ariane program which he noted had had 
an exceptional run 
the risk of a failure is always present at each launch its 
part of the business quilles said 
the first stage of the threestage vehicle holds the strapon 
boosters fueled by a nitrogenoxygen compound that should have 
thrust the 190foot 582ton vehicle into orbit 
the rocket lifted off from this french overseas department in 
northeast south america at 817 pm local time 617 pm est 
tracing a graceful pattern over the launch site 
it was about six miles above the atlantic ocean when the blast 
ripped it apart dallest said wind blowing fuel back toward 
kourou forced residents to stay indoors 
thursdays launch was the 36th ariane mission since the first 
launch in the unmanned space program on on dec 24 1979 
the explosion was the first since the 18th ariane flight blew up 
may 31 1986 and the first of the rocket series since its maiden 
launch june 15 1988 
fortythree satellites have been launched and another 32 are 
scheduled for future launch with a contract value of 236 billion 
in all five ariane rockets have failed in flight previously 
the others were the second mission on may 23 1980 the fifth on 
sept 10 1982 in the presence of president francois mitterrand 
and the 15th on sept 13 1985 
the launch of the two communications satellites marked the first 
time an ariane mission carried an alljapanese payload one 
satellite the bs2k was built by us company general electrics 
aerospace division to direct broadcasting for japans national nhk 
network 
the other a superbird b was built by ford aerospace to channel 
telephone telegraph and telex messages it was owned by 
mitsubishis subsidiary space communications corp 
the bs2k satellite was insured for 150 million to 180 million 
arianespace said while the superbird b was insured for about 60 
million 
jungi inoue of the space communications corp put the launch and 
insurance costs in the range of 600 million

with the argentine austral losing 
value by as much as 25 percent a day the us dollar has become 
the preferred currency in many buenos aires shops stores and 
showrooms 
some businesses refuse to accept the austral altogether many 
others price their goods only in dollars but allow customers to pay 
in australs at their current value against the dollar 
the price list arrives in dollars and we charge customers in 
dollars because the factory insists it be paid in dollars said 
roberto molinelli 48 a ford salesman 
when the distributor delivers a case of champagne i pay in 
cash said ernesto merin 24 owner of an upscale boutique if 
not i have a week or two weeks to pay never 30 days anymore 
but when i pay its in dollars or the dollar amount in australs 
argentines have been stashing dollars away as a hedge against a 
soaring inflation an estimated 5 billion is tucked away in 
strongboxes or under mattresses and 50 billion more is in overseas 
banks 
during the past year the austral has lost 99 percent of its 
value against the dollar 
in february 1989 it took just 17 australs to buy one dollar 
at one point this february it took 4100 meaning the dollar 
increased more than 24000 percent in value 
argentines salaries generally are increased monthly in line 
with inflation which rose by 4924 percent in 1989 and 8124 
percent the past 12month period 
for some time automobiles apartments jewelry furs airline 
tickets and other expensive items have been priced in dollars by 
retailers wary of inflation 
but as the costofliving this year approached 80 percent a 
month stores that sell records leather handbags eyeglasses 
gifts dinnerware and a host of similar items many made in 
argentina now charge in dollars or the equivalent in australs 
we use dollars as a base said optician jorge romero 26 
whose shop is on fashionable florida st in downtown buenos aires 
its so much easier otherwise wed be changing prices several 
times a day 
dentists doctors lawyers economic consultants car mechanics 
carpenters and tv repairmen even housemaids charge in dollars or 
the equivalent in australs 
unions representing schoolteachers have requested that they be 
paid the equivalent of 100 a month the government has ignored 
such requests because it lacks the dollars to comply 
perhaps the biggest problem for business has been what price to 
charge 
i called the factory last month to find out how much it would 
cost to replace some games they sold me said merin the boutique 
owner they quoted me a price in dollars when i checked the 
price i was selling them for in australs i found i was selling at 
cost now i price everything in dollars 
when inflation roared to a monthly record of 197 percent in 
july pharmacies hardware and other stores shut down rather than 
sell too low 
that along with the withholding of deliveries by distributors 
and hoarding by customers has disrupted the commercial supply 
chain across this nation of 31 million people as has the refusal 
of most stores now to accept credit cards 
the apparent solution was to price goods directly in dollars 
but that has put the vast majority of argentines who earn 
salaries in australs at a severe disadvantage 
after i got paid for january i paid my rent and utility 
bills then divided the rest by the number of days in the month 
said a newspaper reporter now what i have left is hardly enough 
to eat on 
typical salaries in january ranged from 200000 australs for 
teachers and other public servants to 1 million australs for lower 
level managers and shopowners the dollar value of those salaries 
eroded from 100500 on feb 1 to 50250 three weeks later 
this will be the worst year for me said juan dainese 43 
manager of one of buenos aires oldest bookstores people dont 
have any money its as simple as that

it was inevitable that someone would make a tv 
movie based on the challenger space shuttle tragedy 
strange thing though unlike many docudramas writerproducer 
george englunds effort with a cast that includes barry bostwick 
karen allen and peter boyle offers taste restraint sensitivity 
and a fair amount of attention to detail 
opposed by many family members of the crew some of whom call it 
an invasion of their privacy challenger which airs sunday on 
abc is anything but exploitative in relating the events leading up 
to the disaster that shocked the world on jan 28 1986 
it doesnt even have what youd expect for the finale the fiery 
blast that destroyed the challenger and killed its sevenmember 
crew among them christa mcauliffe a new hampshire schoolteacher 
instead it ends with the start of the launch with the actors 
in the shuttle reciting lines from john gillespie magees famous 
poem on flying the one that begins oh i have slipped the surly 
bonds of earth 
the threehour film juggles two tasks dramatizing the lives of 
the key challenger figures as well as the behindthescenes events 
in what became the worst accident in the history of americas space 
program 
it generally does both well having the benefits of englunds 
spare taut script glenn jordans tight direction and an equally 
important factor the national aeronautic and space 
administrations advice and cooperation 
the cast is firstrate particularly bostwick as mission 
commander dick scobee allen as the bubbly but determined mcauliffe 
and boyle as a worried engineer at mortonthiokol inc builder of 
the shuttles booster rockets 
with short scenes that start with the crew members and their 
mates the day before the launch the movie shifts back and forth 
from the technical side to the crews personal lives and their 
training for the challenger flight 
the technical scenes involve the worries of boyle and his 
colleagues about the emerging possibility of failure on the part of 
the nowinfamous orings which seal the rockets it also shows the 
resistance that he and his engineers faced from their bosses and 
then nasa officials at the most crucial time 
on the personal side there are good concise sketches of each 
astronaut including the other woman on challenger dr judith 
resnik julie fulton a veteran of an earlier shuttle flight 
and of course the show follows mcauliffe through her wideeyed 
introduction to the space world and opposition to her by one 
astronaut ellison s onizuka keone young who flatly opposes 
amateurs in space 
there are only two scenes of flight in conventional aircraft 
but each is welldone particularly one in which bostwick takes 
allen aloft in a t38 jet trainer the idea is to give her the feel 
of gforces the pull of gravity shell experience aboard the 
challenger at liftoff 
its a beautifully filmed passage imparting a real sense of the 
sheer joy of flight as it shows her startled then delighted 
reactions to a few rolls and loops ive never known anything 
like this she says with a laugh 
bostwick as the friendly unflappable scobee smiles there 
isnt anything like this he says urging her to do something 
you can tell the kids about then he informs her she now has the 
controls 
she overcontrols the jet naturally then englund cheats a bit 
showing her putting it through a slow roll after only a few 
minutes stick time 
but its still a lovely scene so is another on the ground 
inside a nasa shuttle simulator in which the flights sole black 
astronaut ron mcnair joe morton talks his young son through a 
pretend launch 
not all of challenger works two wholly fictional scenes 
each involving mcauliffe dont ring true and slow things down 
but theyre exceptions to a firstclass production that covers a 
lot of material with only one noticeable omission that shuttle 
flights begun in 1981 had become so seemingly routine by 1986 
that abc cbs and nbc didnt even air a live telecast of 
challengers launch 
there was no press mob at the kennedy space center then only 
500 news staffers were there when the flight ended in disaster 
several years later when the first shuttle mission since the 
tragedy was scheduled nasa estimated that 5000 showed up to cover 
the launch of the discovery

tom has aids and he was sinking fast 
he lost his job and his monthly social security checks didnt 
begin to cover his rent food medical expenses and other bills 
the former realestate salesman was in real danger of losing his 
home 
then the 34yearold boston man heard about an upstart company 
that buys the life insurance policies of terminally ill patients at 
a discount cashing in when they die 
tom who asked that his last name not be used sold his 100000 
policy for about 53000 i think its a great idea he said 
it benefits the person who is suffering 
weve had a few people that say this is ghoulish said rob 
t worley sr who started living benefits inc with his son rob 
jr but once they think about it they change their mind 
living benefits based in albuquerque nm requires 
prospective clients to provide evidence that they have 18 months or 
less to live 
the company usually pays 55 percent to 80 percent of a policys 
face value depending on factors such as how long the person is 
expected to live and prevailing interest rates in return 
customers list living benefits as their sole beneficiary 
since the worleys bought their first policy last april at least 
two other forprofit companies have opened their doors american 
life resources corp in miami and beat the grim reaper 
international in new york 
i dont think theres anything as guaranteed as this is in 
terms of getting a return said herman h silverman a high 
school english teacher who started beat the grim reaper last fall 
as a parttime business in his home 
as long as theyre going right now anyway theres a service 
that i can provide for people who want to have their money right 
now silverman said 
the life insurance industry recently started offering its own 
version of living benefits 
prudential announced last month a plan that would let 
policyholders with six months or less to live get the bulk of their 
life insurance proceeds before they die but the plan is available 
in only 10 states 
other companies have taken steps toward living benefits but 
usually allow policyholders to withdraw no more than half the 
policys face value and then often only in monthly installments 
as might be expected the industry is ambivalent about 
entrepreneurs venturing onto their turf 
we recognize theres a desperate need the high cost of dying 
just goes up every year said robert waldron spokesman for the 
american council of life insurance on the other hand this gives 
a third party whos not family an economic interest in a 
policyholders death as a concept that is dangerous 
if more insurance companies follow prudentials lead he said 
he expects that those private companies would very swiftly lose 
their market 
but the private companies dont think so 
american life resources started accepting applications last fall 
and bought its first policy last month 
it would be my great pleasure to take the shingle off the 
door said its president steven simon but then he tells how as 
a volunteer with an aids buddy program the first person he visited 
was sleeping on a bare floor the man had been forced to sell his 
bed 
this is a story thats being told every day in every part of 
this country simon said people in the prime of their lives 
are having every dignity that you and i take for granted just 
robbed from them 
worley said his company has saved at least six homes from 
foreclosure since beginning operations living benefits has bought 
about 50 policies about 50 purchases are pending and about 200 
applications are out he said 
silverman would not disclose how many policies grim reaper has 
bought 
all three companies say the most interest comes from people with 
aids mainly because aids groups have a welldeveloped national 
information network 
simon and worley say they do no advertising silverman has 
advertised in the classified section of a new yorkbased gay 
newsmagazine and also distributed fliers once at the memorial 
sloankettering institute for cancer research in manhattan he said 
administrators there went into a panic 
inside of about a day or two they managed to collect all of 
my stuff and called to inform me they had thrown it out 
silverman said these people just have an aversion to dealing 
with the financial aspect of terminal illness 
a hospital spokeswoman said she could not confirm the story or 
comment further 
the entrepreneurs concede they are wandering into mostly 
uncharted legal territory new mexico is the only state to have 
regulated the new industry adopting for the most part the policies 
the worleys developed in 2 years of researching the concept 
we wanted to be regulated worley said all states need to 
regulate this just to be sure that people are not being taken 
advantage of 
that wasnt a concern for fred a 59yearold san diego man with 
cancer who sold his 250000 policy to living benefits for about 65 
cents on the dollar fred who also asked that his last name not be 
used is spending some of the proceeds to build a new house for his 
wife 
its like having your cake and eating it too he said as 
far as im concerned im going to keep living

eightyearold erik hundley of south nyack 
ny rattles off the civil rights struggles of martin luther king 
jr after a week of study but admits i forgot who harriet tubman 
was 
sameena parveen 13 an eighth grader at kettering middle school 
in largo md is intrigued with the underground railroad movement 
and the role of a virtual unknown john henry 
and 12yearold lakeisha lewis of spencer okla becomes 
sort of angry when she thinks about how the civil rights 
thing came about because i dont think people should be treated 
like that 
the study of black american heroes and heroines went into high 
gear in schools this month as it does every february in 
recognition of black history month although started in 1926 by 
carter g woodson in recognition of the birthdays of abraham 
lincoln and frederick douglas celebration of the special month 
gained momentum when kings birthday became a national holiday 
now kings january birthday is used as the springboard into 
februarys recognition of other black leaders during special school 
assemblies field trips classroom projects book reports skits 
and plays 
its good theres a month to remember the accomplishments of 
the blacks said sameena a native of india some students 
dont seem to care and some people do change their attitudes 
toward other races i think most of the students only act like 
they really care and then quickly forget 
bernadine lyles of the los angeles unified school district the 
nations second largest after new york said many of the 646 
schools start with the king holiday to go into their program on 
black americans 
that holiday has created much more awareness said ms 
lyles instructional adviser of the elementary level for the 
multicultural unit of the office of instruction most students 
have some idea of the civil rights movement and its effect on 
african american history and culture 
san francisco schools spokeswoman madelaine eaton said all 
64000 students participate in a martin luther king essay contest 
as part of black history month the district which is 20 percent 
black also offers students and teachers an array of black american 
art and language resources but each school is left to develop its 
own particular programs 
in some other states the teaching of black history is 
determined mainly by the size of the black student body and by the 
interests of the teachers 
at community high school in carbondale ill english teacher 
anna jackson said there are no special assemblies for either kings 
birthday or black history month 
i really try to integrate black history throughout the year 
by incorporating the works of blacks and other minorities in the 
classroom assignments said ms jackson one of six minority 
teachers about 30 percent of the 1000 students at the school are 
black or asian 
to her dismay though the school usually gives semester exams 
during the days leading up to kings birthday so the kids are 
focusing on preparing for the exam 
at the private allgirl la reine high school in the washington 
dc suburb of suitland md sister kateri said it is a 
frustrating struggle to keep up with the changing needs of the 475 
young women the student body was 12 percent black in 1973 and is 
now 63 percent black three of the 42 faculty members are black 
i would say that the study of black history has come slowly 
but we have tried to integrate it as much as possible said 
sister kateri i think it all depends how strong a teacher might 
be inclined toward spending the individual time although there has 
been a definite push for this 
for others the king holiday underscores the need to include 
other cultures in school curriculum and textbooks 
clayborne carson a former civil rights activist who is editor 
of kings papers a 15year project that is expected to result in 
publication of 12 volumes of kings writings and speeches said 
that in many schools the black history focus is merely token 
its like we created the occasion before we knew what we were 
going to do with it said carson who is at american university 
this semester as a visiting landmarks scholar in american history 
its going to be a long process moving from tokenism to 
meaningful content weve just begun that process 
nannette mcgee consultant for social studies education in the 
georgia department of education said that although textbooks have 
been written about blacks in america it just seems that they 
became old and out of date and they were not used because of that 
social studies textbooks have not been updated in five years 
she said 
murdell mcfarlin of the atlanta public schools agreed 
school officials arent replacing the books right now because 
its not the statescheduled time but they are supplementing them 
with essays and other information said mrs mcfarlin 
iowa in 1976 became the first state to pass a law mandating that 
school curriculum incorporate contributions of minorities and women 
in new york state education commissioner thomas sobol recently 
announced plans to draft broad revisions in the states public 
school curriculum to give greater recognition to the contributions 
of nonwhite cultures to american society the changes would affect 
the states 25 million public schoolchildren 
ellen swartz multicultural project coordinator in the 
rochester ny school district said the district has been 
working for three years designing and producing classroom materials 
about groups that are usually misrepresented or omitted in 
textbooks and other educational materials while most of the 
material developed is used voluntarily by the teachers she said 
officials now are working on a ninth grade textbook on africans 
rochester has taken a step past many districts that ive seen 
not in intent but in actions said ms swartz what we are 
doing thats different is committing the resources and dollars we 
are solidly on the cutting edge of movement in this area 
jack gaffney social studies program coordinator for the san 
diego unified school district said the district tries to 
incorporate a strong multicultural strand into the curriculum 
all the way down through kindergarten 
its a matter of infusing things where they would normally 
occur in history in the curriculum to increase the depths of 
cultural studies said gaffney 
marlowe teig who for 22 years worked with a number of textbook 
publishers said many schools are unable to puchase uptodate 
textbooks that reflect black history school and community 
officials also are not clear about what they want in the textbooks 
and fail to list the criteria he added 
developing textbooks that reflect the role of blacks and others 
in american society is more than just mentioning all the 
leaders or taking a paragraph out and plugging another one 
in he said 
you have to be more reflective textbooks are not like usa 
today they dont line the garbage cans tomorrow they are going to 
be around for years they affect childrens lives

trucks rumble down dirt trails to service 
the wells that have sprouted in this dusty cactusfilled backwood 
dealmakers cram the local hotels and one eatery has installed 
tabletop telephones for them 
oil the onetime backbone of the texas economy that fractured 
in the late 1980s because of a world supply glut has mended 
spurred by new technology and higher prices this part of oil 
country is growing at a pace unseen in years 
some have dubbed it the new spindletop recalling the first 
texas gusher because record flows have come from wells tapped late 
last year using horizontal drilling techniques that maximize 
chances of a find 
but more cautious folks humbled by shortlived booms in the 
past arent so effusive 
you dont see all the new pickups running up and down the road 
that you did during past upswings said inez asher a former 
mayor of dilley the town of 2500 people is at the center of the 
pearsall field activity about 80 miles southwest of san antonio 
ms asher herself was about to leave dilley until she returned 
from a vacation last august to find a resurgence 
land lease prices rose from 50 an acre last year to as much as 
450 the county courthouse in pearsall stays open late at night to 
accommodate landmen searching records 
at the porterhouse inn in pearsall one of the few hotels in the 
area rooms are at a premium one resembled a miniature office 
with a map of the area taped to the wall and a typewriter nearby 
we could rent 60 more rooms if we had em said a desk clerk 
rental housing has been swallowed up by workers coming to join 
the boom 
oil has brought an opportunity to get a quality job said 
pearsall city manager andres garza jr oil rig workers earn about 
9 an hour nearly triple what local farmhands make 
at pappas a truckstop and bus station along interstate 35 
phones were installed at the tables for the land dealers who gather 
there 
sales tax collections have doubled bank deposits are up 20 
percent 
so is traffic were really beginning to need a red light 
ms asher said 
business has tripled and its all oil said innkeeper 
shirley young she and her husband run the dilley hotel and 
restaurant a bedandbreakfast inn now base camp for many oilmen 
once we just figured we were going to dry up and blow away 
she said now its hard to keep an ample food supply 
booms have been seen before in the austin chalk the geological 
formation that includes the pearsall field but the area earned the 
nickname heartbreak field because one well would produce and 
another nearby would come up dry 
the oil there is found in vertical fractures that left little 
room for mistake 
horizontal wells which make a 90degree turn more than a mile 
underground can link several vertical formations increasing 
chances for success the main question is how long the increased 
production rates will be maintained some experts expect the wells 
may expire faster than vertical wells 
while horizontal wells are credited for the austin chalk 
recovery the rebound elsewhere in texas is linked to oil prices 
that have remained relatively steady at more than 20 a barrel for 
months which is considered a sign of strength in the energy market 
the oil industry has been hoping for a return to this stability 
since prices collapsed to about 10 a barrel in 1986 weakened by 
the increased production of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries 
that drop traumatized oil drillers and especially hurt texas 
which had been thriving based on projections of oil fetching 30 
and 40 a barrel or more 
many drillers simply cut their losses by capping wells some 
sought bankruptcy and others liquidated unemployment soared land 
values tumbled banks faltered and the state became a nationwide 
symbol of hard times 
the oil rebound conversely has encouraged many companies to 
increase spending for exploration the resurgence even has drillers 
and service companies worried about finding qualified people to 
work the rigs also in somewhat short supply 
for the first time in four or five years the industry last 
december ran short of rigs used to improve existing wells said 
harry spannous director of the permian basin petroleum 
association the association is based in midland headquarters of 
the west texas oilfield containing about a quarter of the oil and 
gas reserves in the lower 48 states 
bakerhughes incs rig count an index of exploratory 
operations reflects the new activity as of feb 2 83 rigs were 
working in the texas section of the permian basin vs 57 a year 
ago in east texas 57 were looking for oil and gas compared with 
39 last year 
those increases are slight compared with the growth in the 
pearsall field one rig last year 38 now production has more than 
doubled and new discoveries are announced weekly 
oryx energy co of dallas pioneered the process in the region 
persuading the industryregulating texas railroad commission to 
increase allowables the amount of oil that can be pumped from the 
ground and the space required between wells 
since oryx went before the commission in august revealing its 
success with horizontal drilling companies have flocked to the 
field even though oryx had acquired leases on much of the prime 
drilling area before showing its hand said jim roberts the 
companys vice president of production 
although rivals are drilling scores of wells nobody has matched 
oryxs perfect record at finding oil with horizontal wells 
still there have been some spectacular results topped by 
charlie winn 
the oldstyle wildcatter has tapped two major wells on an 
8900acre lease and has three more under way the first well is 
producing 5472 barrels of oil a day a state record and the 
second is producing better than 3600 barrels 
the oil business is fun again winn said

more committees organizers and sponsors than anyone can count 
there is much to celebrate in the decade following earth day 
congress created the environmental protection agency and the 
national oceanic and atmospheric administration and passed the 
clean water act a tougher clean air act the endangered species 
act and other landmark legislation 
then times grew bleak 
ronald reagans secretary of the interior james watt fought to 
open western lands to development over environmentalists 
objections epa administrator anne burford presided over 
substantial cuts in the agencys budget and the white house 
council on environmental quality was cut from 50 people to eight 
one of reagans most quoted environmental observations was that 
trees produce pollution 
the 1980s were the most selfindulgent decade this country has 
seen this century and it knew better said george schaller a 
wildlife biologist with wildlife conservation international in new 
york 
theres much more interest much more understanding much more 
concern now than there was then in 1970 said nelson the former 
senator and governor of wisconsin now with the wilderness society 
in washington dc 
the anniversary observance nelson said will succeed as a 
grassroots explosion of activity as it did in 1970 
two entirely separate national organizations have arisen to plan 
activities for earth day 1990 and for earth week which leads up to 
it they are called earth day 20 foundation and earth day 1990 and 
nelson is honorary chairman of both 
hopefully weve got a pretty friendly competition going 
here said edward furia director of the earth day 20 foundation 
the capitalist system does produce innovation if there was only 
one group we wouldnt feel like maybe we had to work as hard 
the centerpiece of furias campaign is a week of environmental 
exhibits lectures and performances by rock country and jazz 
musicians the festival will be held in a natural amphitheater at 
the side of the columbia gorge in the town of george wash no 
kidding 
dick clark has agreed to serve as host of the festivals music 
which will be broadcast by satellite to vast screens set up in 
shopping centers across the country furia said 
he said he still was negotiating with performers but among 
those who have promised to take part are actress cybill shepherd 
singers willie nelson and john cougar mellencamp and jazz pianist 
michel petrucciani he promises a couple of surprise superstars 
the concept is that every day you would have exhibits in the 
morning people can walk through furia said then we would move 
into the entertainment area 
denis hayes director of earth day 1990 is laying the 
groundwork not only for a celebration in major cities on earth day 
but also for educational and political campaigns that he intends to 
continue after the celebration is over 
among the activities planned by hayes are 
collecting signatures on a green pledge encouraging 
individuals to recycle save energy and water buy products least 
harmful to the environment and support environmental legislation 
a global cities project to help pass laws for recycling 
ridesharing energy and water conservation and waste management 
more than 70 cities have signed up 
an environmental exploration of homes by primary and 
secondary school students a homework lesson in which children and 
their parents look for opportunities to conserve energy and water 
recycle and reduce reliance on toxic substances 
an environmental audit program for colleges in which students 
can assess campus administrative policies regarding conservation 
recycling and pollution six hundred colleges are participating 
the establishment of a global alliance between us earth day 
organizers and more than 1200 groups in 116 countries the 
environmental problems of the 1990s such as ozone depletion and 
global warming are things that cant be solved by any one 
nation hayes said 
promotion of the valdez principles an environmental code 
of conduct for corporations modeled after the sullivan principles 
governing business dealings in south africa 
the sullivan principles required corporations to treat black and 
white employees equitably and to provide job training for blacks 
the valdez principles named after the valdez alaska oil spill 
would require corporations to produce environmentally benign 
products clean up spills and submit to outside audits to 
ensure compliance with environmental laws 
furias plans beyond the satellite broadcast into shopping 
malls of the earth week festival from washington state include an 
international peace climb of mount everest with climbers from 
the united states china and the soviet union 
the climbers led by jim whittaker the first american to scale 
everest plan to clean up trash left on the mountain by past 
expeditions 
furia also is promoting educational programs in schools and 
colleges in cooperation with local chapters of the national toxics 
campaign headquartered in boston 
the national toxics campaign an environmental group that has 
fought against the use of pesticides and the release of industrial 
toxins is seeking signatures on a good neighbor agreement 
pledging private and public organizations to reduce emissions of 
toxic wastes 
but the heart of earth day will be the local and state 
observances nelson said 
there will be lots of demonstration projects of all kinds 
he said youll get speeches peaceful demonstrations youll 
have high schools and grade schools running programs for a week or 
a month planting trees things like that 
people seeking information on earth day activities should call 
their governors office the local office of the environmental 
protection agency or a nearby university nelson said 
the success of the 20th anniversary of earth day will be 
measured partly by the number of people who participate nelson 
said 
as he explained when he announced the campaign last year the 
most important single objective of earth day 1990 is a monumental 
worldwide demonstration by several hundred million people that 
literally shakes the political leadership of the world out of its 
lethargy

clayton forster had lost one job because of 
chronic vertigo and was about to lose another then an experimental 
operation restored his balance by destroying a balance organ that 
had gone haywire 
id have an attack maybe once every few months where i would 
be actually on the floor said forster who suffers from 
menieres disease but i would be under attack maybe months at a 
time very mildly 
you had to be on your toes things were shifting 
doctors dont know what causes the disease which was first 
described a century ago by a french physician it attacks the 
semicircular canals a major part of the bodys balance system 
three tiny sharply bent tubes in the ear filled with a thick fluid 
and lined with hair cells that sense any motion in that fluid 
about 40 million americans suffer from the attacks said dr 
ronald amedee a tulane university medical school ear nose and 
throat specialist its as though the ear is committing suicide 
the vestibular organ is sending nonsense to the brain 
it can be terrible nonsense 
the worst attacks would start with a howling and ringing in my 
ears forster said then everything would be spinning it 
would be as though the floor turned up and became the ceiling like 
the rug was pulled out from under me on my right side i would 
start to shake and sweat then i would start throwing up i would 
fall down always on my left side unable to get up again until the 
attack was over 
a lowsodium diet diuretics or motion sickness medicine control 
attacks for 30 million to 32 million people but if 1 to two years 
of other treatments dont help its time to consider surgery 
amedee said 
forster 30 was in the navy when his first mild attacks began 
in 1982 my job was to launch attack aircraft from the deck of 
the uss eisenhower i had to get up on top of the aircraft to 
check the hydraulic lines while the engine was running on top 
of the carrier deck on the open sea 
a supervisor saw him staggering figured he was drunk and sent 
him to sick bay forster said the base physician said son 
youre not drunk youve got something wrong with your inner ear 
forster ultimately had to leave the navy because of the 
increasing vertigo he was allowed to return after a 1985 operation 
in which doctors drilled a tiny hole to drain excess fluid from his 
inner ear into his brain cavity that helped for about eight months 
and the navy discharged him 
many doctors have abandoned that technique because it so often 
brings little or only temporary relief amedee said another widely 
used operation a selective vestibular nerve section involves 
opening the skull and cutting the nerve that links the semicircular 
canals to the brain it requires several days in intensive care and 
up to two weeks in the hospital 
but with a new procedure streptomycin perfusion patients often 
go home the same day amedee said 
the experimental technique which uses streptomycin an 
antibiotic to destroy nerve cells in the balance organ was 
developed by tulane engineer and pharmacologist charles norris it 
was first tested five years ago by dr john shea jr of the shea 
otologic clinic in memphis tenn 
doctors learned in the 1940s when streptomycin was used to 
treat tuberculosis that big doses could destroy balance and 
hearing amedee said norris who has worked with nasa to find ways 
to fight vertigo and dizziness in space thought injecting the drug 
into the semicircular canals might be the best way to kill the 
misfiring nerve cells 
experimenting on cats because of their acute balance and 
hearing he found a dose that would destroy the parts of the ear 
that control balance but not the ones that control hearing amedee 
said young cats recover their balance in 10 to 14 days people in 
four to 10 weeks he said and they use their eyes and the 
remaining balance organ to stay on an even keel 
amedee and shea presented their findings in one of 14 scientific 
exhibits at the american academy of otolaryngologyhead and neck 
surgery meeting in new orleans in september the presentation 
persuaded doctors in nashville tenn detroit sarasota fla los 
angeles and london to try the operation as the first treatment for 
patients who dont respond to medication said amedee 
i still think the jury is out said dr james e benecke 
jr who treats menieres disease patients at st louis university 
in missouri its being promoted by one individual and being 
investigated by several other individuals i dont think theres 
enough data 
cutting the nerve works he said and putting a drug that is 
very toxic to the inner ear directly into that organ may be even 
riskier than opening up the brain theres really no reason for 
me to abandon the gold standard of operations for something thats 
new and entails some risk he said 
amedee said that of about 350 patients treated in memphis and 30 
in new orleans the only complications have been a few mild 
infections probably the biggest risk associated with our 
procedure is the general anesthesia itself 
forster who had the operation last april 25 is convinced it 
works im not 100 percent and probably never will be its like 
quarterbacks that have had their knee operated on ive had my knee 
operated on and although i can walk now without pain i dont have 
the mobility i used to have 
any time you go into the body youre coming away with less 
than 100 percent but youre coming away with something 
he was about to lose his job as a mechanic for the regional 
transit authority because of accidents driving buses to and in the 
repair shop when amedee told him about the experimental operation 
i was bumping into the side of the bridge going home i 
couldnt keep the car straight they said man if you cant get 
this thing corrected well have to let you go it was too 
dangerous to get behind the wheel of a bus 
now hes fine on four wheels though he no longer enjoys riding 
motorcycles a favorite pastime before menieres disease 
sometimes i feel as if im walking a tightrope but i havent had 
any really bad dizzy spells

brazil is second only to the 
united states in the number of reported aids cases but the deadly 
disease may spread more rapidly here 
i wouldnt want to be brazils health minister said 
mathilde krim of the american foundation for aids research 
theres a probability the aids problem here will rapidly worsen 
and there are few resources to help 
this south american country of 150 million people is in 
transition between thirdworld and developedworld aids 
patterns said peter fischinger vice president for research at the 
medical university of south carolina 
brazil is closer to the developedworld model but the 
possibility of brazilian heterosexuals becoming infected by 
establishedrisk groups is very great fischinger said krim 
agreed there is a lot of multipartner sex activity and also a 
large number of bisexuals 
the first victims in the developed world according to 
fischinger were gay men who still account for 45 percent of 
cases before the disease spread to intravenous drug users and 
heterosexuals in africa and the caribbean a large majority of 
victims were and are heterosexuals 
brazil with 9555 reported aids cases through december 1989 is 
the worlds no 2 aids country after the united states which had 
113211 reported cases according to the world health organization 
france is no 3 with 8025 reported cases followed by uganda with 
7375 
at a gathering last month of more than 50 specialists sponsored 
by french brazilian and us health organizations lair guerra de 
macedo rodrigues head of the health ministrys national division 
for sexually transmitted diseases and aids said brazil has made 
important progress in battling the disease 
sixty percent of brazils 6 million transfusions in 1988 were 
with blood untested for the aids virus she said nine percent of 
the aids cases in brazil were caused by transfusions vs about 1 
percent in developed countries 
the situation is still not ideal but weve tested 70 percent 
of samples in blood banks and the risk has been greatly reduced 
she said adding that the risk of infection via transfusions still 
is 1 in 40000 compared with 1 in 250000 in the united states 
brazils economic crisis with inflation running almost 2000 
percent will mean a 60 percent cut this year in the divisions 
1989 budget of 104 million ms rodrigues said were doing the 
best we can with limited resources 
brazil was slower in acting to combat the disease than other 
countries said michel kazatchkine a french researcher the first 
cases were reported in brazil in 1983 but the government did not 
place a priority on combating the virus until 1987 
in france and the united states homosexuals are well organized 
while brazilian machismo keeps gay groups far more discreet 
she said in france there are a large number of support groups 
with hot lines shelters meetings and other assistance in 1985 
65 precent of reported aids victims were gay men the percentage of 
gay men who account for newly diagnosed cases is less than 45 
percent today 
figures in brazil also show a lower percentage of gays in new 
cases but that may merely mean more rapid growth among others 
in 1986 in brazil krim said there were 117 men carrying the 
aids virus for every woman carrying it that ratio has dropped to 7 
to 1 
ten percent of brazilian aids victims are heterosexuals 
compared with an estimated 5 percent in the united states 
three other factors threaten brazils heterosexual community 
kazatchkine said young brazilians tend to be more promiscuous and 
have less access to aids education and preventive measures than 
their counterparts in developed nations millions of street 
kids work as prostitutes and also have sex with their comrades 
and in part because of the economic crisis more women work at 
least parttime as prostitutes 
a final problem is an increase in the number of brazilians who 
contract aids via intravenous drug use now 128 percent of the 
total krim said

horticultural geneticists and plant 
enzymologists seldom talk to each other the two branches of botany 
use the same language but their dialects are so different they 
rarely translate works to compare notes 
but at texas techs plant stress and water conservation lab 
scientists from a number of disciplines have learned to speak a 
common language drought 
most enzymologists talk only with enzymologists said james 
mahan a plant physiologist with the us department of 
agriculture but here i talk to all sorts of different people 
thats why this interdisciplinary approach is so important 
the labs goal is to find varieties of wheat corn cotton 
onions and other plants that can survive the harsh weather of the 
great plains stretching from canada to texas with its frequent 
drought bitter cold and stifling heat 
the results include droughtresistant cotton and wheat a 
sorghum resistant to insects called midges and grape vines with 
tougher leaves to withstand hail 
though it focuses on us crops and conditions the research has 
international implications said robert albin associate dean of 
research at techs college of agricultural sciences in lubbock 
were representative of the arid and semiarid areas of the world 
such as central and western africa a large part of the worlds 
land surface is semiarid 
john burke another usda scientist studying plant enzymes said 
almost all the research has international applications these 
crops are grown throughout the world this research holds true no 
matter where you are 
burke works with ellen peffley a texas tech assistant professor 
of horticulture specializing in onion genetics she is trying to 
develop onions that can withstand extreme cold burke identifies 
enzymes that make onions more coldhardy and peffley tries to get 
the onions to make those enzymes 
as we discover the basic mechanics this can be applied to all 
crop species she said 
more than 50 scientists and graduate students from texas tech 
the usda and texas aampm participate in the research at various labs 
and agriculture stations there is no specific centralized lab a 
major shortcoming that tech is moving to counter with a 500000 
federal grant toward planning a 17 million complex 
it gets to be quite complicated and we have to keep people 
together and coordinated albin said were in such a 
specialized area of research you might have a molecular scientist 
discover something important but he doesnt know how to grow the 
plant so you have the aampm research station for that 
weve got to keep coordination in mind a geneticist might get 
caught up transferring gene a into plant b and lose sight of what 
its all about 
congress formally created the plant stress and water 
conservation lab in 1988 but the research had been going on at 
tech since the late 1950s the usda picked lubbock as the center of 
the research because of tech lack of rain and temperatures that 
drop below zero in winter and soar above 100 in summer 
scientists affiliated with the lab are enthusiastic though they 
sometimes are at a loss for words to explain their research in lay 
terms or in those of scientists from other fields 
we have some sort of common goal in mind said henry nguyen 
a tech associate professor who specializes in finding 
droughtresistant cereals we see how we can mutually benefit 
each other with our kinds of techniques 
it just takes a lot of patience talking until we understand 
what each other is doing

opossums living on an island off georgia 
are giving scientists information on how competition for survival 
influences aging 
for about 9000 years the opossums on sapelo island have 
enjoyed life without predators as a result they live longer than 
their counterparts that have to face the dogeatpossum rigors 
of the mainland 
steven austad a harvard university biologist has discovered 
another difference the easy island life seems to keep them fertile 
longer too 
ordinarily animals people included produce fewer babies as 
they get older opossums normally live only two or three years and 
2yearold females have fewer and smaller offspring than 
1yearolds but on sapelo the situation is reversed 
twoyearolds have larger litters and their young grow faster 
thats like a 45yearold woman being more fertile than a 
25yearold said austad this tells us that the same species 
living in different ecologies for a few thousand years have evolved 
to have different rates of aging 
he suggests that taking ecology into consideration can shed 
light on why some species live much longer than others

tetracycline long a mainstay of the war on 
disease may be losing its punch 
the drug is one of the worlds most widely used antibiotics and 
is commonly given to treat urinary infections among other ills 
but a study found that many women harbor bacteria that are 
impervious to various members of the tetracycline family 
drs marilyn c roberts and sharon l hillier of the university 
of washington tested women who had not taken antibiotics for at 
least two weeks twentynine percent to 95 percent of the bacteria 
in their urinary tracts were able to withstand tetracycline drugs 
these included both harmless bugs and the kinds that cause disease 
their usefulness has been reduced by the increase in 
resistance to the drug the researchers wrote in the february 
issue of the journal antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy

most americans know a balanced diet is the 
healthiest one but they dont eat that way according to a 
national poll 
moderation seems to be a tough prescription to follow 
americans are surprisingly knowledgeable about nutrition and 
health but when it comes to translating facts into food choices 
most still opt for quick fixes and the latest health fads nancy 
wellman president of the american dietetic association the 
nations largest group of food and nutrition professionals said 
last week at a news conference to announce results of a gallup 
survey 
ninetyfive percent of those polled said balance variety and 
moderation are the keys to healthy eating and 83 percent said they 
were fairly or very concerned that what they eat might affect their 
health 
sixtyfour percent said they were eating more fiber and nearly 
half said they had increased their intake of calcium 
nearly threequarters said they were trimming fat from their 
diets and roughly twothirds reported cutting out saturated fats 
cholesterol and fried foods but only 8 percent said they were 
eating more vegetables while 15 percent said theyd added fish oil 
to their diets 
despite their awareness of basic nutrition principles many 
consumers seem to view food as medicine said margo a denke a 
nutrition research scientist at the university of texas they 
think adding or eliminating a particular food or ingredient will 
automatically prevent or cure illness such an approach is not only 
unrealistic it can also prove harmful 
part of the trouble is a perception that there are forbidden 
foods which seems to make people crave the foods they try to do 
without and then feel all the guiltier when they splurge on them 
prohibition of food creates guilt wellman said and guilt 
destroys good intentions and can lead people to actually overeat or 
binge on those forbidden foods 
thirtyfive percent of those surveyed said highfat foods cannot 
be part of a healthy diet 
the thing that surprised me is that people are still going to 
extremes not in their best interest particularly women who are 
eliminating dairy foods when there are good tasty low and even 
nonfat foods in that category wellman said in a telephone 
interview 
she also cited a continuing misconception that red meat cannot 
be part of a healthy diet 
the advice most moms gave out about a moderate balanced diet 
remains useful and durable wellman said 
one of my favorite specialoccasion treats is a hot fudge 
sundae she said i realize i cant have one for dessert every 
night yet it would be offbase to think i could never eat one 
the gallup organization conducted the telephone survey of 772 
american adults dec 1128 for the ada and the nonprofit food 
industryfunded international food information council the poll 
had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points

a planned price hike by one of the worlds largest newsprint 
producers is unlikely to take effect because supply is plentiful 
and growing at a brisk rate analysts and newspaper officials say 
abitibiprice inc notified customers this week it plans to 
raise the list price of newsprint by 35 a metric ton or 54 
percent to 685 a metric ton 
any broad increase would be the first since an industrywide 66 
percent price hike on jan 1 1988 while the list price has 
remained steady actual selling prices and newsprint makers 
profits have declined 
edward ahern a marketing director for abitibis sales unit 
said the increase is effective june 1 
the torontobased company the worlds second largest newsprint 
maker behind fletcher challenge of new zealand told customers the 
increase is necessary because it is losing money on current 
newsprint sales ahern said 
i sent all our suppliers a letter saying i think its 
ridiculous said homer taylor vice president of supply for 
knightridder inc one of the nations largest newspaper groups 
with consumption and operating rates dropping and supply 
increasing and discounts increasing it just doesnt make any 
sense 
we dont think its the right time said bill hee 
purchasing manager for gannett supply corp owned by the largest 
us newspaper chain its not based on supply and demand there 
is plenty of paper around 
taylor said the price announcement was a repeat of last years 
failed attempt to increase prices and conditions in the industry 
have deteriorated since then advertising linage is down 
substantially and consumption at most of knightridders more than 
30 newspapers is flat to lower he said 
the american newspaper publishers association said daily 
consumption declined 03 percent industrywide last year 
consumption fell 51 percent in the northeast where newspaper 
retail advertising dropped substantially due to financial troubles 
at store chain owner campeau corp it rose 51 percent in the west 
however 
demand for newsprint has held up mainly because knightridder 
and other newspaper companies are stockpiling supplies in 
anticipation of possible labor problems in canada taylor said 
mill workers in canada have asked for a hefty wage increase and 
have threatened to strike if demands are not met when their 
contracts expire on april 30 
conditions are worse this year in terms of making a price 
increase stick taylor said they see all this purchasing and 
are reading it as consumption 
knightridder has increased its inventories to about 50 days 
from 36 days taylor said gannett recently raised its inventories 
about three days to 45 days hee said 
industry analysts also are skeptical that the increase will take 
effect 
wishful thinking said george b adler analyst for smith 
barney harris upham amp co in new york theres too much 
newsprint capacity excessive 
adler said north american capacity is continuing to increase in 
1990 and is not expected to slow until next year 
meanwhile many canadian newsprint makers are experiencing 
problems because of widespread discounting a common industry 
practice 
while the current list price is 650 a metric ton the actual 
selling price to customers is about 530 a ton adler said 
abitibi on monday reported a fourthquarter loss and lower 1989 
profits and blamed it on lower newsprint prices the results follow 
abitibis warning to employees last month of possible mill 
shutdowns and job cuts this year 
nonetheless part of the price increase could take effect 
particularly if canadian employees decide to strike said robert 
duncan analyst with wood gundy inc in toronto eastern canada is 
the worlds largest single source of newsprint

a 1 billion project to deliver as many as 108 
channels of television programming via satellite to home dishes 
small enough to fit on a window sill is being developed by a group 
of four major media companies 
wednesdays announcement left plenty of unresolved questions 
about the service including what programs would be made available 
and how much the service would cost 
but there is no rush the service is not expected to debut until 
1993 
media industry analysts say the venture called sky cable would 
provide expanded choices for viewers encourage production of more 
tv programming and raise competition for cable operators 
but they also note that several obstacles remain including 
overcoming the industrys track record of failed directtohome 
satellite tv ventures in the united states 
the partners are general electric cos national broadcasting 
co rupert murdochs news corp ltd cablevision systems corp a 
cable system operator and programmer based in woodbury ny and 
hughes communications inc a satellite technology concern owned by 
general motors corp 
the partners said they had signed a memorandum of understanding 
for the venture which they said would be the first highpower 
direct broadcast satellite service 
they said the service would be competitively priced but 
specific program offerings had not been determined yet 
the service would be an addition to rather than a replacement 
for existing cable service they contended 
but some analysts disagreed peter appert who follows the media 
business for the investment firm cj lawrence morgan grenfell 
said sky cable poses a significant competitive threat to the 
cable industry 
if i can can get 108 channels priced competitively i dont 
see why i need cable if they can deliver as promised and the 
quality is as promised he said 
sky cable would use the most powerful satellites ever launched 
for commercial communications purposes and be capable of delivering 
both highdefinition television and standard video signals as well 
as digital quality audio 
the companies said the new venture likely would be the first to 
introduce hdtv to the united states on a broad scale 
the venture will cost about 1 billion including an equity 
investment of about 335 million each of the partners plan to 
contribute equal amounts of the equity once they reach a definitive 
agreement 
at a news conference the promoters displayed a receiving dish 
measuring 12 to 18 inches across that they said would be used for 
sky cable they said they expected the dish would cost about 300 
much less than the 2000 to 3000 price tag on bulkier 
conventional dishes 
a few programs would be available free of charge to dish owners 
but subscribers would have to pay for other programming which may 
include multichannel packages single channels and payperview 
programs 
this wont replace cable said charles dolan chairman and 
chief executive of cablevision 
dolan said cable operators will be asked to install service and 
handle billing for sky cable subscribers also will be able to sign 
up on their own 
previous efforts to launch directtohome service in the united 
states have made little headway such services are available in 
great britain and japan 
appert said past us efforts often failed because the receiving 
dish was cumbersome channel capacity was limited and the signal 
often was distorted 
earlier this month a group of nine us cable operators and 
ges american communications unit announced a venture to offer 10 
channels of programming later this year via a ge satellite 
robert thomson an executive at telecommunications inc the 
nations largest cable operator and a member of the cable group 
said the sky cable plans wont affect his groups satellite 
broadcast plans 
sky cable will be competitive to cable he said but cable 
companies have an advantage of a large programming and customer 
base and a flexible and secure transmission system 
news corp offers a satellitedelivered tv service in great 
britain but startup losses have been heavy murdoch said the 
british service has 600000 subscribers and needs 2 million to 
become profitable 
the american sky cable service will need between 3 million and 5 
million subscribers to break even murdoch said 
murdoch and robert wright president of nbc said there are no 
plans to offer their respective tv networks fox and nbc on the 
sky cable 
but cablevision and nbc jointly own the consumer news and 
business channel bravo sports channel america and 10 regional 
sports channels 
murdoch said his company may provide programming for sky cable 
news corp operations include twentieth century fox films and tv 
show production

a subsidiary of general motors corp has become 
the first nonairline company to participate in an airline 
reservation system by signing a deal with texas air corp the 
nations largest airline company 
under the agreement announced wednesday texas air will sell 
half its computer reservation system for 250 million to electronic 
data systems corp 
texas air chairman frank lorenzo denied suggestions that the 
partial sale of system one under discussion since september was 
intended to help bail out financially struggling texas air or to 
ease pressure caused by the strike and bankruptcy proceeding at its 
eastern airlines subsidiary 
the wall street journal reported wednesday that houstonbased 
texas air has offered some of its own cash notes and potentially 
even its own stock to easterns unsecured creditors 
texas air is not entering into this transaction because of a 
need for cash lorenzo said at a news conference adding that his 
company is gaining a strong partner in the increasingly 
competitive reservation business 
eds chairman les alberthal ticking off the benefits of the deal 
to texas air said first and foremost frank did get our cash 
edward starkman an airline analyst at painewebber inc called 
the agreement a cash infusion for the company 
the president of easterns striking machinists blasted the sale 
which he said allows lorenzo to reap a windfall from the 
reservation system that once was one of miamibased easterns most 
important assets 
if this deal is allowed to stand theyre going to be playing 
right into the hands of yet another big lorenzo scam said 
charles e bryan president of machinists district 100 in miami he 
called the deal a lorenzo embezzlement and said he would never 
buy another gm car 
the partial sale of system one must be approved by us 
bankruptcy court in new york where eastern filed for chapter 11 
protection from creditors last march 9 five days after the start 
of a strike 
david i shapiro the courtappointed examiner for eastern is 
aware of the new agreement with eds as is the committee 
representing the airlines unsecured creditors texas air spokesman 
art kent said 
they obviously didnt object to it he said 
lorenzo didnt confirm or deny the journal report on texas air 
offering its own cash and equity to easterns creditors 
previously texas air has strived to keep itself and its 
continental airlines subsidiary separate from easterns troubles 
we own eastern airlines eastern airlines is not some sort of 
distant cousin lorenzo said we are going to do those things 
that are sensible and reasonable 
the airline chief also reiterated he has no plans to merge 
eastern with continental or to liquidate eastern he said 
negotiations on a reorganization plan have been continuing with 
creditors after easterns exclusive right to file a plan expired 
tuesday 
liquidation of eastern airlines doesnt make sense for 
anybody lorenzo said eastern airlines is coming along well 
eastern has a game plan 
system one chairman dick murray told the news conference that 
other airlines eventually could join texas air and dallasbased eds 
as partners in the system which enables travel agents to book 
reservations for airlines hotels car rentals and other traveler 
needs 
if other airlines joined texas airs stake wouldnt be allowed 
to fall below 10 percent he said 
possible future partners mentioned by murray included pan am 
corp america west airlines and alaska airlines 
the partial sale of system one is a radical move for lorenzo 
who has underlined the importance of computer reservation systems 
to airlines competitiveness those systems have been undergoing 
rapid changes and consolidations recently 
delta air lines recently merged its reservation system with 
pars an operation jointly owned by trans world airlines and 
northwest airlines american airlines sabre reservation system has 
been seeking a partner after the justice department quashed its 
plans to link up with deltas system 
united airlines usair and four foreign airlines comprise the 
rival covia reservations system 
in addition to the work it performs for gm eds is involved in 
health insurance government and financial institution data 
processing

digital equipment corp looking to slash costs to 
counter a slowdown in the us computer market might cut its 
workforce by expanding a voluntary severance program a company 
official says 
digital also has reported bugs in its vax 9000 mainframe 
machine a new product the company hopes will reverse a slide in 
earnings but the company and analysts said wednesday the problems 
were minor and should not affect sales significantly 
digital the worlds secondlargest computer company behind 
international business machines corp saw its earnings fall 39 
percent for the six months that ended dec 31 
furthermore the company is walking a fairly thin line 
between the prospects of reporting a profit or a loss for its 
fiscal third quarter which ends in march said mark steinkrauss 
director of investment relations 
digital blames the earnings drop on a lackluster computer market 
in the united states which has forced other companies to make 
cutbacks as well 
to reduce costs steinkrauss said the company recently started 
considering a substantial expansion of the voluntary incentive 
program 
the company last year offered a voluntary severance package to 
several hundred employees in salem nh but analysts said digital 
now appears to be looking to cut several thousand workers 
weve never itemized what the numbers might be steinkrauss 
said the company is considering many alternatives and although 
steinkrauss would not rule out layoffs he noted that digital has 
never had any layoffs 
digital also has reassigned hundreds of employees from 
manufacturing to sales he said 
digital is aggressively addressing the issue of cost control 
internally said terry shannon an analyst with international 
data corp a framingham firm that studies the computer industry 
but its like a supertanker that takes five miles to stop or 
turn around 
shannon said a reasonable estimate on the number of jobs to be 
cut would be 5000 or more digital employs about 125900 
worldwide and more than 70000 in the united states 
cost cutting is necessary at all computer companies said 
barry bosak an analyst with smith barney in new york the 
earnings get squeezed and that puts the company under the gun 
but he added that digital is in relatively good shape despite 
the need to make cuts 
digital is hoping to boost its earnings with the introduction of 
the vax 9000 mainframe with first deliveries scheduled for the 
fourth quarter beginning in april 
weve had some bugs in the machine steinkrauss said but 
none have been unidentifiable and none have been unsolvable 
such problems are common with a new product and should not hurt 
sales of the machine he said adding theres been no major 
slippage in the shipping schedule 
shannon said the initial glitches in the vax 9000 should have a 
minimal impact 
i dont view this as being tantamount to meaning the product 
doesnt work he said

following through on a threat to shrink trans 
world airlines inc unless pilots accept a 10 percent pay cut 
owner carl icahn said he would sell eight jets to raise 350 for 
twas coffers 
icahn announced he would sell two boeing 747s outright and would 
sell and lease back six boeing 767s 
icahn and his employees have been fighting for months over the 
fate of twa which a decade ago was one of the nations biggest 
airlines 
were doing what the pilots told us to do icahn said in a 
telephone interview with the st louis postdispatch they said 
go ahead and shrink the airline so were shrinking it 
icahn did not return phone calls wednesday to his office in 
mount kisco ny where twa is headquartered twa operates a large 
hub and employs 8000 people in st louis 
icahn also has been talking about selling more twa routes a 
process begun two months ago when he agreed to sell the airlines 
chicagotolondon route to american airlines 
possible buyers for twa routes include smaller domestic airlines 
that are looking to expand like southwest airlines co or america 
west as well as large european carriers that want a larger us 
presence like british airways and sas 
although experts generally dont consider shrinkage to be a good 
longterm strategy consolidating could allow a carrier to reduce 
costs and make better use of its equipment and employees in 
selected markets 
the pilots say the decision of whether twa gets bigger or 
smaller has little to do with them 
kent scott chairman of twas pilot union has said he doesnt 
see how the 80 million in concessions sought by icahn would help 
the airline which is burdened with 27 billion of debt and a 
fuelguzzling fleet of aircraft the oldest among major american 
carriers 
meanwhile icahn resumed negotiations this week with twas 
mechanics who have been working under an old contract for more 
than a year and have repeatedly said they would not accept any deal 
involving concessions 
carl icahn has to decide which way to go said jim carey an 
airline analyst at the washingtonbased consulting firm airline 
economics inc its up to him and i assume it depends on whether 
he can get wage concessions 
two other factors may prove to be more important in determining 
twas future as well as the shape of the airline industry in 
general 
one is the cost of jet fuel which is about 50 percent higher 
than a year ago these higher prices are forcing carriers to look 
for additional revenue analysts say 
if we dont see some relief by the summer its going to be 
hard for anybody to avoid making some big decisions said carey 
who is senior vice president for operations at airline economics 
the other factor is the declining rate of growth in air 
passenger traffic 
according to avmark international a general aviation consulting 
firm based in arlington va revenue passenger miles have grown at 
5 percent or less for the last seven months 
and analysts say a good portion of the increases have come as a 
result of discounted tickets 
for the first part of 1989 and most of 1988 revenue passenger 
miles grew 10 percent and more said paul turk an analyst with 
avmark 
the downturn in traffic is going to make the weaker airlines 
even weaker turk said were going to see further 
consolidation

federated and allied department stores have 
asked a federal bankruptcy judge for more time before announcing 
which outlets the companies will close as part of their chapter 11 
reorganization 
but some of the countrys largest shopping center builders 
planned to ask judge j vincent aug jr to deny the retailers 
request at a hearing today 
lawyers for jmb realty corp and melvin simon amp associates argue 
that giving the cincinnatibased retailers more time would hurt 
tenants of shopping malls that are anchored by such federated and 
allied stores as lazarus or bloomingdales 
the developers said a delay also could scuttle planned projects 
under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy act a company filing 
for protection from creditors has 60 days to decide whether to end 
lease agreements for federated and allied which sought bankruptcy 
court protection jan 15 the deadline is march 14 
in a motion filed feb 7 the companies asked to extend the 
decision until a reorganization plan is in place which is 
expected to be in midmay 
we think our request is very realistic and warranted said 
carol sanger spokeswoman for federated stores inc parent of 
federated and allied 
but lawyers for indianapolisbased melvin simon which controls 
66 million square feet of retail space in 200 shopping centers 
said the extension request is excessive and unreasonable and 
should be denied 
the lease issue has become an obstacle for melvin simon which 
plans to build the 625 million mall of america in bloomington 
minn the mall is envisaged as the largest in the world but 
uncertainty about a bloomingdales store planned for the mall is 
delaying a 600 million loan needed to start construction 
officials of federated stores inc have said they plan to close 
only a few of their lessprofitable stores 
ms sanger added we are not talking about an inordinate 
amount of a time extension were only talking about 60 days as 
things stand now 
jmb realty has plans to renovate a shopping center in the 
chicago suburb of skokie to include a new bloomingdales 
equitable life assurance co which owns 14 malls that include a 
federated or allied store also is fighting the extension

transportation secretary samuel skinner says 
he hopes the failing delaware amp hudson railway will be able to find 
a competitive solution to its financial problems 
we have been watching with a great deal of interest the damph 
situation skinner said wednesday but i feel strongly that you 
can only do so much and i would hope that they will work their way 
out of that situation 
skinner said the transportation department would not even 
request that a competing but financially healthy railroad help 
damph out 
we are not in the business anymore of taking a competitor or 
taking an organization that is not making it and forcing some 
company to take that responsibility on on a nonprofit basis he 
said at a breakfast meeting with reporters we have to find a 
competitive way for that service to be provided 
nevertheless skinner said he hoped the bankruptcy trustee could 
work out a merger or trackage agreement to save damph the nations 
oldest continually operating railroad 
in june 1988 damph filed for protection from its creditors under 
chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy law the railway has debts of 
about 100 million 
the damph runs from the new yorkcanadian border south to the 
potomac yard outside washington and from albany ny west to 
buffalo ny 
last week the interstate commerce commission voted to allow 
three railroads to continue operating on damph tracks while the 
trustee works out a plan to operate the line temporarily with 
subsidies from the states of new york and pennsylvania several 
other railroads and some shippers 
the reprieve lasts until friday night 
meanwhile two canadian railroads that had been trying to buy 
damph have said they are still interested in working out a deal 
earlier this month the trustee francis p dicello recommended 
that damph be sold to canadian pacific ltd which bid 35 million 
for the system but the sale fell through when cp was unable to 
secure rights to run on conrail tracks that connect with the damph 
system 
the canadian national railways had made a 45 million offer but 
lost its financial backing before it could make a formal bid last 
week 
the damph which began in 1824 as a canal company runs 20 to 25 
trains daily it owns 569 miles of track and has rights to another 
1012 miles a shutdown would put 672 employees out of work

nordstrom inc stock stabilized after a twoday 
slide knocked 15 percent off its value but bad news continued as a 
union official reported a flood of complaints and claims for back 
pay from the retailers sales clerks 
were getting a lot of inquiries from stores around the 
country with employees saying they want to get paid for work 
already done joe peterson president of local 1001 of the united 
food and commercial workers union said late wednesday 
nordstrom stock rose 75 cents wednesday to 2850 after dropping 
5 on friday and tuesday 
from its summertime high of 4250 a share nordstrom stock has 
dropped 35 percent in value forty percent of the stock is owned by 
nordstrom family members 
peterson said the union which represents 2000 of nordstroms 
3000 sales clerks in washington state had received more than 100 
telephone calls a day in the past two days and took in paperwork 
with more than 200000 in claims by current and former nordstrom 
employees 
the calls followed an order from the states department of labor 
and industies last week requiring nordstrom to pay two years worth 
of unpaid overtime to its hourly employees in the state he said 
i think a lot of employees have been emboldened by the state 
findings he said we were averaging 15 to 20 calls a day up 
until the state findings 
meanwhile peterson said the national labor relations board was 
siding with the union on a complaint from last year that nordstrom 
was attempting to bargain directly with workers bypassing the 
union he said the nlrb informed him wednesday it was issuing a 
complaint against nordstrom 
efforts to reach nordstrom family members wednesday night were 
unsuccessful 
the company said tuesday it was considering filing a lawsuit 
against the state to overturn the department of labor and 
industries ruling which cannot be appealed the administrative 
ruling cited infractions that included failing to calculate 
overtime for some duties and lapses in bookkeeping 
peterson said the union has received claims so far totaling more 
than 24 million claims could soar to the hundreds of millions if 
the union goes through with a nationwide classaction lawsuit as 
it has threatened he said 
nordstrom has disputed the cost figures put out by the union 
peterson said the union didnt want to take legal action and 
would rather settle its differences with the company at the 
bargaining table 
nordstroms stock also has been hurt by the companys 
announcement this week that fourthquarter earnings will be lower 
than a year earlier a decline would be the first since nordstrom 
went public 19 years ago outside securities analysts had expected 
a 10 percent gain 
the company also was the subject of an unflattering front page 
story in the wall street journal tuesday that detailed employee 
complaints including the alleged practice of workers going off 
the clock to perform tasks such as stocking shelves attending 
company meetings and delivering items to customers 
employees were quoted as telling of pressure to produce sales or 
be fired and of backstabbing efforts pitting employee against 
employee 
peterson said he felt nordstrom didnt have to give up its niche 
in the marketplace but would have to change its practices toward 
employees 
their system fosters unfair labor practices illegal 
employment practices and a lack of due process for employees he 
said 
nordstrom has 60 stores in washington oregon california 
alaska virginia and utah it plans 16 more including moving into 
illinois new jersey maryland minnesota indiana connecticut 
massachusetts and new york

resorts international inc says the 
twoyear casino license renewal it received from state regulators 
will help it shake free of bankruptcy and recover from the decline 
that has hit the boardwalks first gambling hall 
the casino control commission said wednesday in its unanimous 
decision to renew the license that the gaming company must report 
monthly on its troubled finances 
company president david c hanlon said resorts the parent 
company to merv griffins resorts casino hotel in atlantic city 
can live with those restrictions 
the conditions are essentially financial reporting 
conditions he said hopefully two years from now well be a 
strong company 
as for now the company is trying to restructure its 
debtriddled finances in bankruptcy court which the commission 
said it considered in its decision 
the mere filing of a chapter 11 action does not in and of 
itself warrant a conclusion that a company lacks financial 
stability said acting commission chairwoman valerie armstrong 
the bankruptcy action is but one albeit significant factor 
she said resorts had shown during commission hearings last week 
that it could become financially stable within the twoyear license 
period under a flat growth scenario 
last month resorts won 143 million from gamblers an 11 
percent drop from the 161 million registered in january 1989 
according to commission figures the casinos win for all of 
1989 dropped 64 percent to 2274 million compared to the year 
before win is the amount of money gamblers lose and does not take 
into account expenses it is not profit 
under the flat growth forecast resorts will post a 500000 
cash deficit at the end of the year because of an extensive 
refurbishing program the commission said in its ruling 
the commission imposed conditions recommended by the division of 
gaming enforcement that resorts file monthly balance sheets income 
statements and statements of cash flow and working capital resorts 
officials also must advise regulators on a monthly basis of 
significant deviations from financial projections and from prior 
financial performance 
the commission stopped short however of requiring the casino 
to report daily or weekly or to set a specific cash balance that 
would trigger the imposition of restricted accounts to ensure that 
wages taxes and progressive jackpots are paid 
hanlon said he was pleased with the decision and confident the 
opening april 2 of the neighboring taj mahal casino would reverse 
the decline of the first gaming hall to open on the boardwalk in 
1978 
ironically the taj mahal a property originally owned by 
resorts led to some of its financial problems as construction 
costs since 1983 until its sale to donald trump in 1988 diverted 
money from resorts and its capital expenditures 
hanlon emphasized the importance of resorts plans to win 
approval of its restucturing plan from bondholders and a bankruptcy 
judge the plan seeks to shed about 400 million of the 927 
million that griffin assumed to finance his november 1988 purchase 
of the property from trump griffin sold trump the taj mahal in 
return 
our first priority is restructuring hanlon said after the 
hearing were going full speed ahead with it 
anthony j parrillo the director of the division of gaming 
enforcement said the division was satisfied with the ruling but 
took issue with the commissions refusal to set a 75 million cash 
balance trigger or to consider a worstcase scenario of less than 
flat growth 
ms armstrong said the commission could reopen the license 
process any time during the next two years however she also said 
resorts had not hit the depth of the nowdefunct elsinores 
atlantis casino hotel which in may became the first casino to 
close its doors after the commission found the gaming hall was 
insolvent

legacy name before using it on its compact car made in japan and 
lafayette ind

comes out of left field frankly 
the legacys base price is about 15000 a fullyequipped 
legend the top of hondas acura line of luxury cars sells for 
about twice as much 
two other trademark battles involving automobile names were 
fought and resolved last year

tektronix inc will lay off 600 employees 
by late may because an anticipated sales increase has not 
materialized 
most of the layoffs will occur in washington county in the test 
and measurement group doug babb spokesman for the beavertonbased 
electronics company announced wednesday 
the test and management group manufactures various products 
including tektronixs original product line oscilloscopes 
the group typically accounts for more than half tektronixs 
sales but its volume recently has declined at a faster rate than 
the companys other lines of business 
other employee cuts will occur in tektronix operations that 
handle us and international distribution channels 
babb said some employees to be laid off were told the news 
before wednesday mornings public announcement while others had not 
yet been chosen as required by the federal plant closure law each 
employee involved will get 60 days layoff notice and the 
opportunity to apply for posted vacancies elsewhere in the company 
babb said 
we expected our new product flow would provide us with enough 
growth to begin to show earnings improvement david p friedley 
tektronixs president said in a prepared statement 
after expenses for the cuts plus taxes and other costs are 
subtracted the beavertonbased company probably will post a loss 
for the quarter ending march 3 company officials announced 
friedley attributed the companys problems partly to weak demand 
in the defense computer and semiconductor industries 
our product line and market positions remain strong he 
said but we must get our expenses into line with our revenue 
the 44yearold company manufactures electronic testing and 
measuring gear television control room equipment computer

jordache jeans merely provided investment 
capital when it bought into guess jeans a jordache lawyer said 
calling a lawsuit against the nakash family a case of sellers 
remorse 
attorney howard weitzman also denied on wednesday allegations by 
the marciano brothers who founded guess that the nakash brothers 
sought to steal guess designs for their jordache line 
the evidence will show that the marcianos at the time the 
deal was made needed money weitzman said in his opening 
statement to a superior court jury 
the evidence will show the marcianos intent was to sell the 
company to the nakashes he said the evidence will show that 
the nakashes said rather than just buy the company lets form 
a partnership 
the marcianos are seeking more than 500 million in damages plus 
a return of the nakashes half ownership of guess the latter part 
of the decision is up to superior court judge norman epstein 
last year a jury did find that the nakashes intended from the 
start to steal for jordache the trendy guess designs that were 
catching the fancy of the fashion world this weeks proceedings 
launch the penalty phase of the trial 
weitzman contended that the beverly hillsbased marciano 
brothers were looking for outside financing before the nakashes of 
new york agreed to purchase a halfinterest in guess in 1983 
the israeliborn nakashes paid the marcianos 475 million and 
extended a credit line as part of the deal weitzman said 
guess sales have since skyrocketed with sales volume exceeding 
400 million in 1988 weitzman said 
this lawsuit is about sellers remorse he said 
the frenchborn marciano brothers maurice armand paul and 
georges founded guess in 1981 with an investment of 170000 
a frozen account containing the nakashes accrued share of guess 
profits now contains more than 93 million and the division of 
that account also is at stake the marcianos also contend the 
nakashes were responsible for destroying a guess fashion 
subsidiary gasoline 
the marcianos also have named as defendants a hong kong couple 
lee sec mon and his wife who manufactured jordache products in the 
british crown colony they allege the lees were to have 
manufactured gasoline designs as well but diverted materials to 
jordache 
weitzman told the jury he would show that the demise and 
destruction of gasoline was caused by the marcianos failure to 
live up to their commitments 
the nakashes have filed a counter suit against the marcianos in 
superior court as well as a federal court lawsuit that accuses them 
of racketeering

the government is considering giving companies more 
tax breaks for charitable contributions abroad amid concern 
friction may grow over japanese investments in the united states 
an official said today 
the foreign ministry proposed the tax measure and the finance 
ministry will consider it for implementation in the fiscal year 
starting april 1991 the foreign ministry official said 
full details of the measure were not made public 
at a meeting last week foreign minister taro nakayama told 
leading businessmen he was concerned that japans image in the 
united states was in serious trouble he urged japanese businesses 
to contribute to us communities in which they have businesses 
nakayama said the problem underlying americans fears about 
japan is their feeling that japans policy objectives and the 
japanese way of thinking are not clear and that it is impossible to 
guess where japans huge economic power is headed and under what 
philosophy or principles 
in short there are an increasing number of americans who 
think the japanese are faceless or there is no knowing what they 
are thinking 
tax regulations now permit japanese companies abroad to deduct 
only contributions that promote japanese culture such as museum 
exhibits or cultural exchanges the official said on condition of 
anonymity 
foreign branches of japanese companies may however deduct 
contributions from foreign tax bills 
the new proposal was designed to allow new foreign branches to 
make charitable contributions even before they turn a profit and 
must pay taxes abroad parent companies in japan would be able to 
deduct contributions from their japanese taxes the official said 
japan has a weak tradition of corporate philanthropy and 
business executives some as concerned about japans image abroad 
as the foreign ministry have said incentives are needed to 
encourage companies to become better corporate citizens in the 
united states 
the foreign ministrys proposal will take time to work through 
the finance ministry the official said it must be studied in 
detail to determine its impact on tax revenues he said 
it would not however require approval by parliament the 
official said japans foreign investment especially in the united 
states soared in recent years as japanese companies built 
factories bought foreign companies and real estate and sought land 
and labor cheaper than at home 
some investments provoked controversy in the united states such 
as last years purchase of columbia pictures by sony corp and the 
purchase of a controlling interest in new yorks rockefeller center 
by mitsubishi estate

in yet another step to cope with sagging 
profits and a sluggish market for personal computers apple 
computer will lay off 3 percent of its work force as part of a 
major costcutting campaign 
although the transition we are experiencing is by no means an 
easy one it is necessary to build an even stronger business 
foundation for the future john sculley apples chairman and 
chief executive officer said in a statement wednesday 
since december apple has been embroiled in a tumultuous 
restructuring that has included the resignation of the head of the 
companys domestic division also the companys new products 
developer jeanlouis gassee reportedly is preparing to depart 
the company also has implemented pay freezes cuts in 
profitsharing and even dropped company parties 
analysts say apple must deal with rising customer 
dissatisfaction sagging profits management turmoil and worsening 
employee morale 
this is an extremely important year for apple particularly in 
terms of product development and stability in the executive 
suite said benny lorenzo an analyst at volpe covington amp welty 
in san francisco 
the most significant problem for apple is its eroding position 
as the biggest supplier of easytouse computers a position that 
has allowed it to charge substantially higher prices than 
competitors like ibm and compaq computers 
microsoft has released its windows programs a graphical 
interface that attempts to offer a userfriendly alternative to the 
macintosh interface 
hewlettpackard co also has unveiled a similar system called 
new wave 
analysts say apples products are still easier to use but not 
as much as they once were 
separately on thursday apple announced immediate cuts of 10 to 
17 percent off the suggested retail prices on all models of its 
macintosh se and se30 personal computers and laserwriter iint and 
iintx printers sold domestically 
david hancock senior vice president of marketing said the cuts 
would allow apple bring the macintosh personal computing 
experience to more people 
apple is now paying the price for decisions they made several 
years ago when it elected to go for shortterm profit gain rather 
than taking advantage of its leading position to go for greater 
market share said jonathan seybold publisher of los 
angelesbased seybold report on desktop publishing 
sculley blamed the 400 layoffs on a slowdown in the us 
personal computer industry which after three years of doubledigit 
growth is expected to grow no more than 9 percent in 1990 
but analysts have faulted the worlds secondlargest personal 
computer maker for neglecting and even alienating its traditional 
customers 
apple failed to meet a critical customer need by not introducing 
an inexpensive updated version of its original macintosh which has 
loyal users worldwide 
instead apple introduced expensive macintosh models for 
corporate use where profits are greater 
after numerous delays apple also released a portable computer 
considered by many as costly bulky and difficult to read 
apples stock rose 50 cents to 34 a share in national 
overthecounter trading wednesday 
most of the cuts in apples 13500member work force which 
become effective in two months will be made in domestic marketing 
and distribution and in personnel finance community and 
government affairs and customer service 
the company will continue hiring workers for research and 
development and for its domestic sales force hirings also will 
continue in apples european and pacific divisions 
most everybody left at the company is making a big sigh of 
relief but apple will still have the problem of low morale in its 
product development division that remains to be corrected said 
abigail christopher of international data co a market researcher 
in framingham mass 
apple had sales of 53 billion last year up about 25 percent 
from 1988 
in the final three months of last year however sales rose only 
6 percent and profits fell 11 percent that was the third 
consecutive quarter of lower profits and came during the 
traditionally strong christmas season 
dealers reportedly were angered that apple did comparatively 
little holiday marketing for its 13yearold apple ii line and 
support products prompting customer fears that the company would 
abandon the machine that catapulted it to prominence 
lack of effective marketing also apparently crimped sales of the 
macintosh plus and macintosh se the least expensive products in 
the macintosh line 
many apple employees increasingly have been complaining about 
the companys turmoil especially the numerous restructurings since 
cofounder steven p jobs was ousted in a 1985 power struggle with 
sculley 
these latest moves are basically the undoing of the last 
reorganization and thats been the pattern said seybold

us officials today accused japan of not doing 
enough to reform deeprooted business traditions and economic 
behavior that contribute to japans 49 billion trade surplus with 
the united states 
after the first of two days of trade talks members of the us 
delegation complained that japanese plans to help ease the trade 
imbalance hadnt gone as far as we hoped 
it is very important to note that some progress has been made 
but frankly much more needs to be done said a member of the 
us delegation who briefed reporters on condition he not be 
identified 
us trade negotiators had said going into todays session that 
they expected quick results in addressing the underlying causes of 
the persistent usjapan trade imbalance 
us trade negotiators are under heavy pressure from congress to 
demonstrate progress in the 9monthold talks which are aimed at 
changing deeprooted factors in both economies that contribute to 
the us trade deficit with japan 
us trade representative carla hills has said she expects a 
plan of action and a realistic down payment that shows resolve on 
both sides by this summer 
the 49 billion us trade deficit with japan accounted for 45 
percent of 1989s 10858 billion us deficit 
in two earlier rounds of talks us officials said japans high 
savings and investment rates its land policies exclusionary 
business practices and corporate alliances inefficient retail 
distribution networks and pricing mechanisms all act as trade 
barriers 
japan in turn said inadequate savings and investment in the 
united states shortterm corporate strategies by us firms 
ineffective labor training and education and insufficient export 
promotion were structural factors underlying the trade imbalance 
after talks in september and november us officials complained 
that the japanese side had shown little evidence of flexibility or 
willingness to act quickly while japanese officials said such 
farreaching changes could not be expected overnight 
japanese officials today explained a recently announced program 
involving tax tariff and import promotion policies nhk reported 
the measures include tax incentives for importers and elimination 
of tariffs on 1004 items 
the immediate us reaction to the japanese presentation was 
severe nhk said 
an official of the ministry of international trade and industry 
speaking on condition of anonymity concluded after the days talks 
that it would take more time for the two sides to iron out their 
differences 
us officials had earlier reacted with caution to the measures 
expressing skepticism over whether the importboosting policies 
would really increase purchases of foreignmade goods 
another key area of contention is japans large retail store 
law which requires firms wanting to open department stores or 
supermarkets to obtain consent from existing smaller stores that 
are generally reluctant to face competition from larger more 
efficient retail outlets 
the lengthy complicated process of opening a large store takes 
about 10 years 
in addition to protecting less efficient retailers and thereby 
driving up prices the us side says the law tends to restrict 
imports by limiting the number of foreignowned stores and by 
restricting openings of large stores that tend to sell more 
imported products than traditional small stores 
williams said the us side would call for abolition or revision 
of the law 
washington is also likely to urge an easing of laws restricting 
use of bank credit cards while department stores and finance 
companies allow incremental payments on credit purchases made with 
bank credit cards must be paid off entirely within one month a 
regulation that us officials say tends to restrict overall 
consumer spending and therefore spending on imports 
on friday us officials are expected to explain washingtons 
plans to increase low savings and investment rates and to bolster 
the competitiveness of us firms

grain and soybean futures prices were mostly 
lower in early trading today on the chicago board of trade largely 
in reaction to precipitation overnight in key us crop areas 
one storm system brought beneficial rain to eastern kansas in 
the heart of the wheat country while another poured welcome 
precipitation on the midwestern corn and soybean region from 
central iowa east into illinois and indiana 
other bearish factors this morning included a brazilian soybean 
crop estimate from a semiofficial brazilian agency that was higher 
than expected and indications that the agriculture department has 
rejected bids from morocco and sri lanka for us wheat at 
subsidized prices 
with the slight early losses the markets appeared to have lost 
momentum for further increases after wednesdays moderate gains 
in early trading wheat futures prices were 1 cent lower to 
cent higher with the contract for delivery in march at 385 a

the food and drug administration today 
approved a lowcalorie fat substitute made from milk and eggwhite 
proteins for use in frozen desserts 
the product called simplesse and described as an all 
natural fat substitute is manufactured by the nutrasweet co it 
is designed to have the taste and texture of fat but with fewer 
than half the calories 
the first product to be made with simplesse will be a frozen 
dairy dessert called simple pleasures which the company said has 
the creamy taste of ice cream but with significantly reduced 
calories and cholesterol 
the fda approved the companys petition to affirm that the food 
additive is generally recognized as safe 
simplesse is approved for use in frozen dessert products only 
the company would have to get further fda approval to use it in 
other foods said fda spokesman jeff nesbit 
nutrasweet a subsidiary of st louisbased monsanto co also 
developed aspartame the artificial sweetener marketed under the 
name nutrasweet 
the fda approved simplesse for use as a thickener or texturizer 
in frozen dessert products simplesse contains proteins from egg 
whites or milk or a combination of both 
foods containing simplesse will have to include the product on 
their labels because some people are allergic to eggs or milk or 
both the fda said 
simplesse has also been approved for marketing in west germany 
the united kingdom switzerland japan belgium the netherlands 
and luxembourg 
the fda is reviewing a petition from kraft inc seeking approval 
for the use in frozen desserts of a fat substitute made from egg 
whites and milk proteins 
also under review is a petition from proctor amp gamble co which 
wants to use a sucrose polyester called olestra as a partial 
subsitute for fats and oils in shortenings salad oils and cooking 
in the home and by the food service industry 
lisa lefferts staff scientist at the center for science in the 
public interest said the group has no safety concerns about 
simplesse however the group has recommended that the fda monitor 
the impact of products such as simplesse on the american diet 
will we eat more and more doubledip ice creams and eat less 
nutritious foods or will they help us lower our fat intake we 
dont really know lefferts said 
the company said simple pleasures will be introduced in 
chocolate strawberry rum raisin coffe peach and toffee crunch 
and other flavors would be added later 
as an example the company said simple pleasures strawberry 
contains 120 calories and one gram of fat per fourounce serving 
compared with 250 calories and 15 grams of fat for the same amount 
of a leading superpremium brand 
monsantos stock surged as word of the fda approval circulated 
on wall street rising 437 in early trading to 11225 a share

eurotunnel sa the consortium building a tunnel 
under the english channel named a new director general for the 
project part of an agreement with its contractors 
eurotunnel said wednesday bechtel executive vicepresident john 
neerhout had been nominated to the position replacing alastair

the anglofrench consortium said 
late tuesday eurotunnel and tml struck a deal to defuse a 
financial crisis that had placed the tunnel projects future in 
doubt neerhouts appointment was part of the agreement 
tml was unhappy with mortons appointment and refused to sign a 
key financing agreement with eurotunnel and creditor banks the 
move effectively cut off all loan monies to eurotunnel and forced 
the company to negotiate a settlement with the contractors 
eurotunnel issued a written statement late tuesday saying the 
agreement allowed the parent company to draw on new loans from the 
banks eurotunnel also will comply with a court order to pay tml 
some 116 million in back fees 
morton had served as britains chief of project responsible for 
negotiating with contractors he developed a reputation as a tough 
bargainer and contractors viewed him as insensitive to their point 
of problems with cost overruns and delays 
alistair fleming and keith bernard deputy director general for 
contruction and deputy director general for transportation will 
report to neerhout the eurotunnel statement noted 
the anglofrench consortium said morton also will remain as

contract negotiations between greyhound lines inc 
and its drivers union have broken off and a strike has been 
called for 1201 am march 2 the company said today 
no discussions currently are scheduled between the company and 
the amalgamated council of greyhound local unions said george 
gravely a spokesman for the dallasbased company that operates 
both greyhound and trailways the only nationwide intercity bus 
systems 
the union which represents 6300 drivers plus other maintenance 
and office workers did not immediately return telephone calls 
seeking comment 
gravley said the company received a letter today saying the 
strike would take place the rankandfile earlier had authorized a 
strike 
gravley said the company which has been advertising for 
permanent replacement drivers in anticipation of a strike would 
continue to operate 
we have 600 people in school and are still taking 
applications he said 
the two sides had been negotiating since friday in phoenix 
where the union is based but remained far apart on wage issues 
joint meetings friday and monday plus separate sessions with a 
federal mediator on tuesday failed to result in an agreement 
gravley said 
the company taken private three years ago in two deals totaling 
about 470 million had offered a threeyear contract worth about 
63 million gravely said the union initially had sought a pact 
valued at 561 million but reduced that to 475 million 
the union wanted wage increases of 66 percent over the life of 
the contract including a 50 percent raise in the first year 
greyhound offered a firstyear increase of 7 percent currently 
the average bus driver makes 24743 a year according to the 
company 
it is an excellent offer from a company that lost 20 million 
over the last three years and it is all this company can afford 
said greyhound chairman fred g currey who led the buyout of the 
bus company from phoenixbased greyhound corp 
the union has not disputed the fact that we cannot afford to 
pay more than we have offered he said instead union leaders 
have told us repeatedly that an employers ability to pay is 
irrelevant 
besides the 6300 drivers the union represents 1600 office 
workers and 1475 maintenance workers

while some grand old american retailers have 
stumbled into bankruptcy court and others simply have vanished one 
major department store is thriving with its founders 
greatgrandchildren in charge 
of the three major us department store chains controlled by 
descendents 122yearold strawbridge amp clothier is the oldest and 
the only one to last through four generations of potential sibling 
spats and inheritance squabbles 
strawbridges has grown steadily through the takeover obsession 
of the 1980s in which many rivals became sodden with the debt 
obligations of new owners some of whom didnt know much about the 
business 
perhaps the most notorious example is the campeau corp of 
canada which bought bloomingdales jordan marsh and several other 
famous chains in the late 1980s for billions of dollars in borrowed 
money then sought bankruptcy protection for them last month 
because it couldnt repay debts 
strawbridges by contrast has expanded with its own money over 
the past decade it has added four department stores and 10 
discount stores in the philadelphia area considered one of the 
birthplaces of modernday retailing the company has 13 department 
stores and 23 discount stores in pennsylvania new jersey and 
delaware 
its presence is a beacon for philadelphia shoppers who have 
witnessed lit brothers and gimbels go broke and wanamakers the 
countrys first retail department store sold twice strawbridges 
has been as steady as the modest quaker family that runs it 
eighteen of its 20 top executives have been with the company at 
least 25 years and more than half its 110 midlevel managers have 
worked for the store 15 years or more strawbridges claims one of 
the lowest turnover rates on the sales floor 
it has surpassed traditional big brother wanamakers as the king 
of the citys department stores wanamakers coincidentally once 
again is for sale 
for its 1989 fiscal year ended in july strawbridges earned 
279 million on sales of 9211 million the companys sales are 
expected to exceed 1 billion in fiscal 1990 
while many competitors profits are drained by creditors or 
retained for a parent company strawbridges has reinvested 
earnings in expansion and upkeep 
the independence of the company is the major contributing 
factor to what we think of and call the uniquely personalized 
character of strawbridge amp clothier francis r strawbridge iii 
chairman once said in response to a lawsuit filed by an outside 
investor who wanted to buy the company in 1986 
his uncle and family patriarch g stockton strawbridge 
described the effort to remain family controlled as an ever 
present objective comparable to inhaling and exhaling 
in an effort to avoid attracting the attention of wouldbe 
raiders the camerashy strawbridge family resists press interviews 
about the business 
one executive who spoke on condition of anonymity attributed 
the familys unity to good fortune as well as g stockton 
strawbridges efforts at maintaining a tightknit relationship 
strawbridge amp clothier is now run nearly entirely by the 
strawbridge family 
the clothier family whose wealth was devastated by the great 
depression sold most voting shares in the 1930s a clothier sits 
on the board of directors but is the only descendent of the 
founder involved with the stores 
for family businesses surviving beyond three generations can be 
difficult because interest in running the business often wanes from 
one generation to the next said ronald h drucker a family 
business consultant with philadelphiabased accountants laventhol amp 
horwath 
the problems pop up more in the third generation than the 
second said dean schuckman a partner and management consultant 
with the accounting firm price waterhouse if the family is more 
sharing of the founders vision youre going to find less conflict 
among the siblings 
for strawbridge amp clothier fertility has helped the 
strawbridges have been able to pick those interested and talented 
from a large pool of offspring 
strawbridge children arent encouraged to enter the business 
but if they want to pursue a career in retailing they have to work 
at least a year at another major department store before entering 
strawbridges training program 
four members of the fourth generation work at the company one 
fifth generation member daughter of company president peter s 
strawbridge joined the advertising department in january after 
three years at filenes in boston 
francis r strawbridge iii his brother david w strawbridge 
personnel vice president cousin peter strawbridge and his brother 
steven l strawbridge treasurer and secretary have 12 children 
among them and there are scores of other fifth generation children 
two other major department store chains still are family 
operated dillards based in little rock ark started in 1938 
and is still run by 75yearold founder william dillard nordstrom 
inc based in seattle is operated by the grandsons of the 
founder who started the firm in 1901 
strawbridges first opened in 1868 on the site of thomas 
jeffersons old us secretary of state office in downtown 
philadelphia 
justus c strawbridge then 30 took his landlords soninlaw 
isaac h clothier also 30 on as a partner in his fledgling dry 
goods store 
the threestory house at the corner of eighth and market streets 
has grown to take up most of the block and anchor a downtown 
shopping mall 
since then the company has had many offers but faced its most 
serious challenge in 1984 when a new york investor named ronald 
baron was amassing shares in the company for a takeover attempt 
two years later the strawbridges defeated baron by purchasing a 
crucial bloc of stock from dissident family member robert e 
strawbridge iii who appeared ready to sell the cost of retaining 
family control was 40 million 
as an additional defense the company has established a 
preferred class of stock that has 10 votes per share common stock 
has one vote per share the board decides who can buy preferred 
stock 
an executive who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
company has considered two or three times a debtfinanced 
restructuring to protect itself from more takeover attempts but 
that alternative has been rejected by the family because it would 
divert too much money into debt payments 
without anxious junkbond holders waiting to be paid or 
shortterm investors looking for quick gains strawbridges has 
been able to spend its profits on store improvements and 
maintenance 
in plowing back those earnings they are able to keep our 
stores up to date fashionable attractive exciting and places 
where people really like to shop the lone clother board member 
isaac h clothier iv once said during the takeover fight with 
baron nothing looks dinty at strawbridge and clothier

although the british are indisputably the worlds 
biggest tea fans preliminary estimates released thursday show that 
britain for the first time lost its position as the worlds top tea 
importer to the soviet union 
moscows tea imports rose 92000 metric tons last year to a 
record 227000 tons pushing the soviet union into first place 
according to the independent business information concern the 
economist intelligence unit 
in its latest review of key commodity markets the economist 
intelligence unit estimated british imports totaled about 160000 
tons last year 
the romebased food and agriculture organization put british 
imports at 116400 metric tons in the first nine months of 1989 
down from 125100 in the same 1988 period 
the soviet union has increased the amount of tea it imports 
steadily since 1986 when its own tea crop grown in georgia was 
severely damaged by fallout from the chernobyl nuclear disaster 
particularly heavy soviet tea buying toward the end of last 
year which coincided with crop problems in india sri lanka and 
other key tea exporting countries helped push world wholesale 
prices to threeyear highs 
at the peak last october the average price paid at the weekly 
london tea auction hit 2885 per ton the price at this weeks 
sale was at a sixmonth low of 2095 according to the tea 
brokers association 
the price decline is the result of improved supplies following a 
recovery in production in india and sri lanka toward the end of 
last year traders said 
the prospect of a supply shortfall for the second year running 
could lift the average price in 1990 to 2360 a ton from 2103 
last year 
the economist intelligence unit said it expected soviet imports 
to hold steady this year because it would be difficult to cut 
supplies during the present upheavals shortages of food and 
other goods have exasperated soviet citizens and aggravated 
political turmoil at a time of serious unrest in some soviet 
republics

the group that is acquiring gulfstream 
aerospace corp has let its 60 million agreement to buy learjet 
corp expire due to fears that the bankruptcy filing by learjets 
parent integrated resources inc could hamper the deal 
a spokesman for gulfstream said the companys chairman allen e 
paulson decided to drop plans to acquire the corporate jet maker 
out of concern that the bankruptcy case could lead to a bidding 
fight for learjet 
integrated a diversified holding company based in new york 
filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors on feb 
13 that same day a group led by paulson and the investment firm 
forstmann little amp co announced an agreement to buy gulfstream for 
825 million from chrysler corp and a letter of intent to buy 
learjet 
because of the complications of the bankruptcy filing the 
possibility of an approval of the learjet sale by the bankruptcy 
court would take too long to resolve and could end up in a bidding 
situation said gulfstream spokesman al balaban 
although learjet was not included in integrateds bankruptcy 
filing the sale of learjet would need bankruptcy court approval 
said learjet spokesman bill robinson 
we still are an asset of integrated resources he said 
following the gulfstream announcement thursday learjet said it 
would begin accepting other offers for the company integrated has 
been trying to sell learjet which is based in wichita kan since 
august 
as a matter of fact we have an interested company visiting 
our plant today robinson said 
balaban said paulsons top priority now wass completing the 
acquisition of gulfstream the savannah company he founded in 1978 
chrysler bought gulfstream from paulson for 637 million in 1985 
and made it part of its chrysler technologies corp subsidiary 
chrysler put the maker of corporate jets up for sale as part of its 
move to concentrate on building cars and trucks 
learjet this week lost a us navy subcontracting bid worth more 
than 1 billion to produce more than 200 tanker transport trainer 
system aircraft but balaban said that had nothing to do with 
pauslons decision to back away from learjet

san jacinto savings and loan association has filed 
a 14 billion claim against its parent southmark corp saying the 
junkbond built company now in bankruptcy court forced it to make 
bad loans 
southmark had envisioned san jacinto as its core business after 
emerging from bankruptcy court proceedings southmark last month 
submitted a chapter 11 reorganization plan calling for the sale of 
nearly all assets except san jacinto 
southmark on thursday reported a net loss of 568 million on 
revenue of 267 million for its first quarter ending sept 30 
1989 that compared with net income of 114 million on revenue of 
561 million in the same 1988 period 
after allowing for a dividend on special stock the pershare 
results amount to a loss of 124 in the 1989 period against a loss 
of 20 cents in the 1988 period 
southmark said the lower revenue was offset in part by shrinking 
administrative expenses plus 31 million in interest saved by the 
bankruptcy filing 
the report was delayed while the company formulated its 
reorganization plans a plan submitted in court last month called 
for retaining houstonbased san jacinto and turning over remainding 
assets to creditors after pumping an additional 100 million into 
the thrift 
but creditors wednesday called the plan unworkable and asked 
us bankruptcy judge steven felsenthal for permission to submit 
their own reorganization proposal that would surrender the thrift 
to regulators and quickly liquidate the remaining company 
a hearing on the creditors request to end southmarks exclusive 
right to propose a plan is scheduled for march 14 
san jacintos 14 billion claim against southmark seeks payment 
for 584 million in bad syndication loans guaranteed by southmark 
and as much as 376 million in loans made at the direction of the 
company 
san jacinto is the only large savings institution in texas that 
hasnt been seized or sold by federal regulators when southmark 
bought the thrift in 1983 it entered into agreements with 
regulators to maintain the institutions net worth above required

the thrift said its tangible capital had fallen about 195 
million below regulators minimum levels san jacinto claims 
southmark owes another 274 million to meet the new riskbased 
capital requirements imposed by last years federal thrift bailout 
legislation 
the creditors claim the thrift is losing 10 million a month and 
is failing to meet its business plan according to court papers 
filed by a group of the companys creditors 
they say the proposed 100 million injection still would leave 
san jacinto short of minimum capital requirements putting the sampl 
at risk that regulators could seize it at any time 
southmark representatives citing continuing negotiations 
between the company and its creditor group declined to comment on 
the committees contentions 
the creditors are mainly holders of over 1 billion in junk 
bonds southmark filed for protection from creditors last july 
after saying it could not meet payments on more than 11 billion 
in mainly highyield bonds 
southmark used the bonds to finance an expansion into an 8 
billion asset company with holdings including campgrounds 
insurance companies and a chain of nursing homes in addition to 
various real estate enterprises

us officials engaged in trade negotiations with 
japan said thursday that country has not done enough to address the 
underlying causes of the persistent usjapan trade imbalance 
at the conclusion of the first of two days of talks us 
delegates complained that japans plans to help ease its 49 
billion trade surplus with the united states hadnt gone as far 
as we hoped 
in particular japan is moving too slowly in changing its high 
savings and investment rates land policies exclusionary business 
practices inefficient retail distribution networks and pricing 
mechanisms us officials said 
it is very important to note that some progress has been made 
but frankly much more needs to be done said a member of the 
us delegation who briefed reporters on condition he not be 
identified by name 
on friday it is the united states turn to explain what it is 
doing to change american practices that contribute to the 
imbalance us officials said they would outline washingtons 
plans to increase the low us savings and investment rates and to 
bolster the competitiveness of american firms 
the talks called the structural impediments initiative were 
launched last may after years of exchange rate adjustments and 
other steps failed to significantly reduce the imbalance 
this round of talks originally set for early january was 
postponed at japans request until after national parliamentary 
elections sunday that kept the liberal democratic party in power 
because of the election we did lose time and we believe 
strongly that we need to get moving quickly and move forward to 
some solutions said deputy us trade representative s linn 
williams 
after the delay us officials said they expected japanese 
leaders to produce plans for both longterm measures and immediate 
actions to tackle structural trade problems 
us trade negotiators are under heavy pressure to demonstrate 
progress in the talks to stave off protectionist trade legislation 
in congress 
the political realities are such that sii is not viewed 
with patience and therefore if that process is going to yield 
results it needs to yield a sort of midterm dividend payment very 
quickly david c mulford us under secretary for international 
affairs told a business audience in new york thursday we would 
all lose if the failure to remove these impediments leads to more 
rather than less protection 
us officials say japans high savings and investment rates 
its land policies exclusionary business practices inefficient 
retail distribution networks and pricing mechanisms all indirectly 
restrain trade 
on thursday japanese officials explained measures in a draft 
budget before parliament to boost staffing of japans fair trade 
commission its antimonopoly enforcement authority to increase 
spending on public infrastructure such as roads and sewers and to 
reform the retail distribution system 
they also explained revisions of japans land use law aimed at 
curbing real estate speculation and increasing the supply of 
available land in urban areas 
the us side contends that excessive land prices in japan drive 
up the cost of doing business making it harder for foreign firms 
to sell their products here 
we carefully explained the steps that were taking and in many 
areas received an assessment from the us side but other areas 
remain where there were still differences its going to take more 
time said an official of the ministry of international trade and 
industry speaking on condition of anonymity 
members of the us delegation said the presentations 
represented new actions and some progress but its clear to us 
they havent gone as far as we hoped with bold new thinking 
too often today instead of new ideas on how to solve the 
problems we heard simply a defense of the status quo one us 
official said 
us officials said they made a number of suggestions on 
possible revisions of japans large retail store law 
the law requires firms wanting to open department stores or 
supermarkets to obtain consent from existing momandpop stores 
generally reluctant to face competition from larger stores 
in addition to protecting less efficient retailers and thereby 
driving up prices the us side says the law tends to restrict 
imports by limiting the number of foreignowned stores and by 
restricting openings of large japanese stores that tend to sell 
more imported products than traditional small stores 
after structural talks in september and november us officials 
complained that the japanese side had shown little evidence of 
flexibility or willingness to act quickly while japanese officials 
said such farreaching changes could not be expected overnight 
williams characterized the latest talks as neither successful 
nor disappointing but he said the talks were on the right 
track in many ways i wish we had gotten on the track earlier 
japan says us problems contributing to the trade imbalance 
include inadequate savings and investment the shortterm nature of 
us corporate strategies ineffective labor training and education 
and insufficient export promotion 
both delegations said they expected to produce an interim report 
on progress in the structural talks by early april after an 
additional meeting in march a final report is expected by summer

when it had 5456 million in losses from discontinued operations 
meanwhile preston said in response to a question that he and 
other avon executives have had conversations with stockholders with 
significant holdings of avon including two separate groups led by 
minneapolisbased investor irwin jacobs and texas financier robert 
m bass 
he characterized the contact with these two groups as 
positive supportive and helpful 
at a meeting with chartwell a limited partnerhip preston said 
avon repeated that the big new yorkbased beauty products company 
is not for sale 
chartwell which holds about 91 percent of avons stock has 
said it intends to launch a proxy fight to win four seats on avons 
11member board

partners in chartwell include a subsidiary of dallasbased mary 
kay corp the privately held parent of mary kay cosmetics a 
direct seller of beauty products avon is the worlds biggest 
direct sales company 
preston said he emphasized to chartwell that avons sales 
representatives wouldnt welcome any link to mary kay whatsoever 
over time mary kay has become the enemy to avon 
representatives he said 
chartwell has maintained that if it decided to pursue avon it 
wouldnt propose a combination of it and mary kay

eastman kodak co on thursday unveiled an 
electronic filmediting system that marks the companys entry into 
the emerging field of hybrid electronic photography 
the premier image enhancement system uses electronics to take 
the place of a razor blade or airbrush in manipulating a film 
image it can be used for retouching cropping creating composite 
images or changing the color balance and contrast of a photograph 
electronics is going to take over the manipulation and storage 
of images in many ways said raymond h demoulin head of kodaks 
professional photography division 
kodaks experience in traditional photography gives the company 
an edge in hybrid technology said eugene glazer an analyst with 
dean witter reynolds inc 
hybrid systems such as premier have the potential to improve the 
quality of photographic prints which could increase sales of 
conventional film products that are kodaks mainstay glazer said 
premier introduced at the photo marketing association 
international convention in las vegas is faster and produces 
higher quality images than systems already on the market demoulin 
said 
the system is made up of a film reader and film writer 
identical gray boxes the size of a large chest of drawers and a 
computer workstation based on a modified sun microsystem computer 
the film reader accepts color negatives color transparencies or 
lithographic films which it scans at a resolution of up to 3600 
picture elements or pixels per inch 
the digitized image can then be edited in a variety of ways 
using an electronic pen or puck the film writer writes the 
altered image on new film either color transparencies or color 
negative film creating a highquality secondgeneration original 
images can also be stored on 8mm videotape or transmitted 
electronically 
demoulin said the quality of the final product is 
indistinguishable from that of the original 
premier operates on the redbluegreen continuous tone 
technology of film rather than the cyanmagentayellowblack 
technology of graphic arts systems demoulin said 
kodaks final display in new york citys grand central station 
a huge photograph of a plump red apple floating behind the citys 
skyline was made on premier 
making the composite picture the traditional way would have 
meant hours of cutting around the fine details of the skyline with 
a razor blade and then rephotographing it with the picture of the 
apple said robert blakey of kodaks professional photography 
division 
premiers zoom feature allowed the picture of the skyline to be 
enlarged making it easier to edit tiny details 
the system which will be sold beginning this fall for under 
500000 is targeted at fullservice photo labs doing advertising 
work magazine art or other large photo displays demoulin said 
he said kodak eventually hopes to produce smaller simpler 
models to serve smaller labs and professional photographers

strong said arthur stevenson an analyst with prudentialbache

trade representatives in guatemala is seen by some analysts as a 
step toward eventual reinstatement of coffee export quotas but

the near future 
particularly with prices going up theres going to be less 
interest in reinstating quotas said sandra kaul an analyst with 
shearson lehman hutton inc

exxon corp on thursday lowered its fourth 
quarter and 1989 profit estimates by 300 million to account for 
legal costs and additional cleanup charges associated with last 
years alaska oil spill 
the revision marked the first time the worlds largest oil 
company has included litigation expenses in its spillrelated 
charges which now total more than 2 billion 
it also coincides with alaska attorney general douglas bailys 
disclosure that justice department and exxon attorneys might file a 
plea bargain settlement friday over pending criminal charges for 
environmental damages from the spill 
a dollar amount involved in a possible settlement has not been 
disclosed 
the additional charge announced thursday brings to 800 million 
the amount exxon deducted for outofpocket spillrelated expenses 
in the fourth quarter 
new developments and assessments led to the revised estimate 
of future costs associated with the valdez accident exxon said 
in a statement released late thursday 
spokesman bill smith declined to provide details except to say 
they were for past as well as anticipated litigation cleanup 
and environmental restoration expenses 
we havent broken it down smith said 
smith said the company did not know whether the company plans to 
add additional charges in 1990 for legal or other costs 
an exxon tanker that ran onto a reef last march 24 in alaskas 
prince william sound spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil 
fouling miles of shoreline and killing fish and other wildlife 
in addition to the charges there are 170 spillrelated lawsuits 
pending against exxon 
for the fourth quarter exxon estimates its earnings will total 
485 million or 37 cents a share down 65 percent from 14 
billion or 106 a share in the comparable 1988 period exxon 
earlier estimated fourthquarter profits of 785 million or 61 
cents a share 
revenue was up 15 percent in the quarter to 266 billion from 
23 billion 
for all of 1989 exxon revised its earnings estimate to 35 
billion or 274 a share from its earlier 38 billion or 298 
a share that was a 34percent drop from 53 billion or 395 a 
share in 1988 revenue was 961 billion compared with 886 
billion 
the latest provision comes on top of charges totaling 880 
million in the first and second quarters and more than 400 million 
in insurance proceeds that exxon has said it expected to have 
available to help pay for spillrelated cleanup costs 
exxon annnounced this week that it would return to alaska on may 
1 to clean up remnants of the spill exxons announcement followed 
a coast guard declaration essentially ordering the company to 
return 
although exxon has said it would continue the cleanup this 
spring it also has worried state and environmental officials by 
insisting that the wind and wave action would make cleaning 
unnecessary this summer

resources inc said thursday that it lost 184 million in its third 
quarter reflecting the problems that led to its recent filing for 
bankruptcy court protection

million or 53 cents a share a year earlier 
revenue for the period plummeted to 335 million from 1044 
million a year earlier

for years the sterling image of wonderful 
service and quality merchandise at the nordstroms department store 
chain has been the envy of the retail industry and fueled 
expansion customer loyalty and high profits 
now that image has been tarnished by a state labor finding that 
the company doesnt properly compensate its sales force and by 
worker allegations the behind the quality service is oftengrueling 
pressure to produce sales 
but some shoppers say theyre not ready to stop buying at 
nordstrom even though their visits have become somewhat of a guilt 
trip 
i will probably still shop here because of their merchandise 
but i dont agree with the way they treat their employees said 
annette voeller a communications manager said outside nordstroms 
flagship seattle store 
i dont think ill stop shopping there but its nice to pay 
the employees said angela kristie a sportswear saleswoman at 
competitor frederick and nelson who passes up her 20 percent 
employee discount to buy shoes at nordstrom 
the state department of labor and industries last week found 
nordstrom systematically made employees perform workrelated duties 
without compensation and ordered it to pay them two years worth 
of overtime 
the finding stemmed from a complaint by the united food and 
commercial workers union which said clerks were expected to 
deliver merchandise to customers homes do inventories and attend 
company pep talks on their own time 
the union estimates workers in washington are owed up to 40 
million while california employees of the store are owed 300 
million 
their system fosters unfair labor practices illegal 
employment practices and a lack of due process for employees 
said joe peterson president of local 1001 
nordstrom issued a statement thursday saying it accepts full 
responsibility for any pressure employees have felt to perform 
these duties without pay spokeswoman kelley tormey said 
nordstrom already has given employees compensation claim forms 
and instituted a new policy in which employees sign special 
timesheets when they go on customer deliveries so that they get 
paid tormey said 
nordstrom is exploring whether one of the states findings 
regarding calculation of overtime was based on correct 
interpretation of the law said tormey 
its premature to talk about the size of the impact of the 
findings on the companys image she said were very very 
concerned 
the rulings come as the company is in contract negotiations with 
the union which claims to represent around 1400 of the 3000 
sales clerks in washington the last contract expired july 31 
the states findings have divided employees as well as shoppers 
while some complained of hours of unpaid work others saw the issue 
as a ploy to ensure the unions survival 
to make out that people are oppressed here is insane said 
david fehrenbacher a womens shoes salesman who says he works 
regular hours to pull 30000 a year before profitsharing 
its not too bad for just standing there selling shoes you 
dont need a college degree and you dont need a technical 
background fehrenbacher said 
whatever the outcome of the dispute it is likely to affect 
nordstroms profitability analysts said 
the conflict is being watched widely by retailers because of the 
industrywide trend toward reinstituting commission sales which 
was led by nordstrom nearly all nordstrom salespeople receive a 
base salary of 985 per hour plus commission 
nordstrom generates about 400 of retail sales per square foot 
of floorspace about twice the industry average sales help 
earnings are also about twice the industry average 
the companys pretax profit margin of about 85 percent annually 
is one of the highest in the highly competitive industry 
analysts said nordstroms profitability is enhanced by 
offtheclock work but that quantifying the amount is difficult 
however they said changing the commission system to compensate 
employees would be costly 
theres no doubt that the profitability is partly 
attributable to offtheclock work said carol palmer retail 
analyst with duff and phelps in chicago if a uniontype 
mentality takes over its the worst thing that could happen 
if the company alters its commissions policy due to the union 
dispute other retailers will adapt that to their own needs 
analysts said 
everyones going into commission programs i dont think the 
trend will be derailed there will be a correction in the 
commissions system and it will continue said pam stubing vice 
president with moodys investor service in new york 
but analysts and shoppers say norstrom also benefits from a 
strong merchandise lineup and its noquestionsasked returns policy 
nordstrom has 60 stores in washington oregon california 
alaska virginia and utah it plans 16 more including moving into 
illinois new jersey maryland minnesota indiana connecticut 
massachusetts and new york 
from its high of 4250 a share last summer nordstrom stock has 
dropped 35 percent in value closing thursday at 2925 a share 
forty percent of the stock is owned by members of the founding 
nordstrom family 
the stock stabilized wednesday after a twoday slide knocked 15 
percent off its value 
nordstroms stock also has been hurt by the companys 
announcement this week that fourthquarter earnings will be lower 
than a year earlier a decline would be the first since nordstrom 
went public 19 years ago and a marked reversal from analyst 
estimates of a 10 percent gain

the justice department and exxon corp are 
near agreement on settling possible criminal charges over last 
years massive alaska oil spill several sources said thursday 
but alaska officials said late thursday they would not endorse a 
tentative agreement outlined by the justice department and hoped 
improvements can still be made that would make it acceptable to the 
state 
under the proposed agreement the federal government would 
abandon its commitment to alaska to assist with its civil claims 
against exxon complained alaska attorney general douglas baily 
he told reporters that the justice department was trying to 
force the state to make a hasty endorsement of a plea 
bargaining agreement that amounted to little more than a pig in a 
poke and falls short of ensuring full restoration of damaged 
resources 
environmental groups and a congressman also called the plea 
bargaining inappropriate accusing the bush administration with 
pushing for a quick settlement that would allow exxon to escape 
more severe criminal penalties 
from all accounts the bush adminstration is giving exxon a 
wink and a nod a mere slap on the wrist said jay hair 
president of the national wildlife federation 
justice department spokesmen would only confirm that plea 
negotiations have been under way with exxon whose tanker exxon 
valdez released 11 million gallons of oil off alaska in prince 
william sound last march it was the countrys worst oil spill 
but several sources both in and out of the government all 
speaking on condition that they not be identified said a 
settlement could be announced as early as friday 
exxon announced thursday it was taking another charge against 
earnings of 300 million for litigation costs in connection with 
the spill bringing the companys total costs to more than 2 
billion 
the justice department talks with exxon were said to revolve 
around possible penalites of up to 500 million to be paid over a 
number of years by exxon into a natural resources restoration for 
prince william sound 
one source said that under the draft agreement exxon would have 
to pay only 150 million initially with the rest of the 500 
million spread over seven years with each payment subject to 
challenge by exxon 
if you read the fine print it could be substantially less in 
actual payments overall said the source who spoke on the 
condition that he not be identified 
in addition justice has sought a lesser criminal fine but the 
amount could not be learned thursday night 
exxon attorneys have tried to limit the amount of money they 
must pay directly to the us treasury as criminal penalties 
preferring to pay most of the penalties into the restoration fund 
sources said 
there was no answer at exxons offices in new york thursday 
evening earlier in the week company spokesmen declined to discuss 
the discussions with the justice department 
environmental lawyers said that money paid for restoration under 
the criminal settlement could be tax deductible as an ordinary cost 
of doing business and later may be used to reduce future 
assessements against exxon under various civil proceedings 
criminal penalties could not be deducted from future assessements 
nor would they be tax deductible 
under two criminal statutes used by federal prosecutors in oil 
spill cases fines of up to double the cost of the cleanup could be 
levied 
the administration is moving too quickly said mike matz of 
the sierra club and chairman of the alaska coalition a group of 
environmental and civic organizations 
exxon is responsible for the worst environmental tragedy since 
three mile island and the justice department wants to punish them 
with little more than a slap on the wrist 
bob adler a spokesman for the washingtonbased natural 
resources defense council said no settlement should be signed 
before the extent of longterm damages to natural resources is even 
known he said 500 million would be grossly inadequate 
in alaska state officials accused the justice department of 
abandoning their state 
if the latest draft of this agreement is imposed alaska would 
find itself on the short end of the stick we are being asked to 
accept a pig in a poke and that pig smells awfully bad said 
a statement issued by the offices of gov steve cowper and attorney 
general douglas baily 
meanwhile attorneys representing plaintiffs in civil suits 
against exxon filed a petition in federal court in anchorage asking 
that any plea bargaining agreement be subject to an open court 
hearing before becoming final 
rep george miller dcalif also criticized the justice 
department bargaining with exxon saying the agreement may not 
provide full damages and might jeopardize the rights of other 
parties seeking damages from exxon 
miller chairman of the house interior subcommittee on water 
power and offshore energy resources said the bush administration 
was moving too quickly 
the criminal investigation hasnt even reached the stage of 
indicting miller told reporters
