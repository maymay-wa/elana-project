prime minister felipe gonzalez on friday 
called early elections for oct 29 trying to take advantage of a 
fouryear economic boom that is endangered by inflation and a 
growing trade deficit 
gonzalez 47 seeks an unprecedented third term for his socialist 
party 
he said he is calling elections eight months before the legal end 
of the current fouryear legislative session to seek a new mandate 
to meet the important challenges when western europe drops trade 
barriers in 1993 
what we seek is sustained economic growth to continue job 
creation our prime objective gonzalez told reporters 
he touted the booming spanish economy that has averaged a 
europeanhigh 45 percent annual growth since 1986 the year the 
country joined the european economic community but he also warned 
against runaway consumer spending 
king juan carlos will sign a decree saturday setting elections 
for oct 29 
the date chosen is seven years and a day from the oct 28 1982 
landslide victory that gave the socialists their first absolute 
majority of 202 seats in the 350seat lower house of parliament 
gonzalez also seeks to take advantage of disarray among centrist 
and rightist forces 
a major factor in his decision is considered the socialists 
performance in june 15 european parliament elections 
the socialists won 395 percent of votes enough to gain another 
majority in parliament and govern alone through 1993 analysts said 
if reelected gonzalez is expected to take stiff measures to 
curtail demand and try to maintain the economys momentum needed to 
reduce spains 173 percent unemployment rate europes highest 
observers say a clear socialist victory will relieve pressure 
from unions seeking greater social spending a longrunning dispute 
between the government and the socialist general workers union led 
to a oneday national strike by workers dec 14 that paralyzed the 
country but the socialists appear to have regained momentum since 
that low point in popular support 
socialists now hold 183 of the 350 seats in the lower house of 
parliament the popular party holds 91 the centrists 28 and the 
conservative catalan minority 19 smaller parties hold the rest

now that leona helmsley is a convicted tax 
evader the question arises will the billionaire hotelier 
accustomed to a penthouse apartment and a 28acre country estate go 
to jail 
or will she be sentenced to community service forced to live in 
and manage a city welfare hotel perhaps as a mayoral candidate 
urged friday 
and how much of her money will she have to give up 
the answers lie with us district judge john walker jr who has 
scheduled sentencing for nov 14 
walkers options range from probation and community service to 
prison time and fines that could go as high as 8 million 
mrs helmsley was convicted wednesday of 33 counts of tax evasion 
and related charges that carry three or fiveyear prison terms 
the judge will base his decision in part on a presentencing 
memorandum by prosecutors submitted shortly before sentencing 
outlining the facts of the case and including a recommendation for 
sentence 
the defense also submits a position paper and can provide letters 
from friends and family in support of mrs helmsleys character at 
the time of sentencing she will be given the opportunity to make a 
personal plea for leniency 
so far prosecutors arent saying what their recommendation will 
be us attorney benito romano said after the verdict that it was 
premature to discuss the sentence and he would not speculate on the 
possibility of community service 
but harrison goldin the city comptroller and a democratic 
candidate for mayor wrote to the judge friday and suggested a 
prison term after which mrs helmsley would be remanded under 
house arrest to a new york city welfare hotel she should be 
required to manage the facility as well as live there 
figures from the internal revenue service indicate that a 
majority of criminal tax offenders are sent to prison 
irs spokesman frank keith said there were 2619 convictions in 
1988 for criminal violations of the federal tax law including tax 
evasion fraudulent tax shelters narcoticsrelated offenses and 
false reporting 
of the sentencings last year 1590 tax offenders received prison 
sentences keith said 
a tax trial that walker presided over in 1987 bears striking 
resemblance to mrs helmsleys although the money involved was much 
greater 
the lead defendant schnejer gurary a wealthy garment center 
executive was convicted of similar charges for using phony bills to 
claim 130 million in tax deductions over seven years mrs helmsley 
was found guilty of disguising about 4 million in personal expenses 
as business expenses in three years 
walker sentenced gurary who was 76 at the time to three years 
in prison and fined him 2 million mrs helmsley is 69

strengthening friday but forecaster gil clark said gabrielle could 
get stronger as it moved into tropical waters 
meanwhile tropical storm felix was expected to weaken again as 
it drifted northward in the central north atlantic 
its winds which had dropped to 35 mph below the 39 mph 
threshold for a named storm wednesday picked up to 40 mph on 
thursday but were likely to drop back later friday forecasters said

longitude or about 650 miles southwest of the westernmost azores 
moving to the north at 5 to 10 mph the depression was expected to 
continue on this course friday with a gradual turn to the northwest

the department of housing and urban development 
has failed to deliver on promises to clean up a program riddled with 
mismanagement hud auditors say in an internal report covering the 
early months of the new agency administration 
the audit praises at length program reforms ordered by new hud 
secretary jack kemp but said the agencys field offices have been 
slow to implement them causing no visible improvement in the 
system 
in another development the new york times reported that deborah 
gore dean a key figure in the investigation of political abuse of 
hud programs stated in a deposition that she had her office files 
shredded as she was leaving her job as executive aide to kemps 
predecessor samuel r pierce jr 
i gave them to the inspector general and had them shredded by 
the inspector general ms dean said in the april 1988 deposition 
the times reported in its saturday editions 
inspector general paul a adams huds chief internal 
investigator told the times he did not know what ms dean was 
talking about and i cant imagine under what circumstances we 
would do anything like that 
federal agencies differ on their rules for saving office files 
and there was no indication of any wrongdoing by ms dean in her 
handling of the documents the times said 
ms dean pierces assistant from 1984 to 1987 gave the 
deposition in a civil lawsuit in us district court in chicago 
which involved developers accusing hud of reneging on an agreement 
to renegotiate the terms of a mortgage on a large housing project 
the hud auditors report program reforms on attributes part of 
the problem to a lack of direction from hud headquarters 
problems still exist and will continue to exist unless there is 
a coordinated leadership drive by the various offices in 
headquarters who are responsible for property disposition 
activities the auditors said in the report which was obtained by 
the associated press this leadership and coordination was not 
apparent during our review 
the audit was completed last week and covered the januarymay 
period 
hud officials on friday said it was unfair to take the criticism 
as a reflection on kemps leadership noting that he did not come to 
the agency until february and then had to assemble a management 
team hud spokesman jack flynn said kemp was not briefed on the 
problems in the singlefamily home program until april and 
immediately took steps to improve it 
among those steps was a june letter to huds regional directors 
in which kemp warned that their jobs would depend on improvements in 
managing the program under which hud hires private closing agents 
to handle property transactions 
the audit referred to that letter as one of the kemp 
administrations positive steps 
your responses have been very positive and indicate that much 
is being done to improve control over the handling of property sales 
and related proceeds said the report nevertheless because 
certain actions that were promised in connection with our previous 
reports have not been implemented or are being implemented very 
slowly we are reopening our previous report findings 
the new report recommended tighter regulation of the closing 
agents including requiring them to obtain licenses and file 
financial disclosure forms 
the singlefamily program has received considerable attention 
during the recent investigations of mismanagement fraud and 
influencepeddling at hud during the reagan administration 
a 1987 nationwide review of huds sales and acquisitions of 
singlefamily properties found many private closing agents hired by 
hud were late in paying the agency millions of dollars and in some 
cases werent paying at all 
among the agents was a maryland woman dubbed robin hud after 
she said she kept more than 5 million that belonged to the agency 
and gave some of it to charity 
that audit blamed most of the problems on outdated accounting 
systems and lax monitoring of closing agents a dozen agents are 
under investigation and several are being sued to recover money hud 
says is owed 
some new initiatives designed to tighten controls on the program 
were established prior to kemps appointment and he has since 
ordered other changes the auditors praised the promises but said 
hud has been slow to translate them into action 
the most serious transgression the auditors said was that some 
field offices still arent requiring closing agents to submit proof 
that the money due hud was wired to the agency 
delays in the submission of sales proceeds and sales packages 
still exist and in some cases available evidence indicates that 
large amounts of money have been misappropriated the auditors 
said 
the report said hud failed to meet a may target for establishing 
a new automated accounting system for the program and that some 
field offices arent using a contract developed in 1987 that was 
designed to make the closing agents more accountable 
in only 155 of the 448 cases examined during the audit did hud 
receive its money on time of the late payments 38 were made 20 
days or more late 
hud loses interest when it receives late money but the report 
didnt estimate how much was lost because of the late payments 
covered by the audit 
the auditors reviewed eight hud field offices and currently are 
examining the administration of the program at several more 
more than 370000 was recovered from closing agents because of 
the audit but an indianapolis agent still appears to owe the agency 
257000 said the report which did not identify the agent 
at several of the eight offices some property files could not be 
located including 173 at the denver ofice where of the 298 files 
reviewed only 43 contained records confirming that the sales 
proceeds were wired to hud the report said

brothers jack and charles colbert did a lot 
of washing in jail but it wasnt clothes they were laundering it 
was postage stamps the government says 
an indictment announced friday charges the colberts washed 
cancellations from the stamps and sold them at a discount in a 
mailorder business they ran from the somerset county jail 
they were just running a small business out of a jail cell 
said postal inspector walter a gilliland 
the imprisoned pair could be sentenced to 39 additional years 
each if convicted on charges of conspiracy mail fraud and misuse of 
postage stamps said assistant us attorney stuart j rabner 
officials said they caught on to the scheme in march after being 
tipped off by potential customers 
jack colbert 37 and charles colbert 42 originally from mount 
vernon ny are serving 13year federal prison sentences for 1986 
convictions on mail fraud wire fraud and conspiracy charges 
stemming from a toxic waste disposal scheme in new york 
the indictment says that while the brothers spent december until 
june in the county jail awaiting trial on state toxic waste dumping 
charges they ordered canceled stamps in bulk 
in one case they allegedly sought to buy 110 pounds of canceled 
stamps from a source the indictment did not specify bulk sales of 
canceled stamps are advertised in stampcollecting magazines 
the brothers also wrote the march of dimes asking for canceled 
stamps according to the charges 
the colberts offered to sell mint ungummed stamps at a 
75 percent discount in minimum 20 lots the indictment did not 
reveal how the cancellations were cleaned from the stamps 
gilliland would say only that corrections officers turned over 
two empty shampoo bottles and a partly filled plastic container of 
liquid laundry detergent taken from the colberts shared cell 
gilliland said the men were given extra mailing privileges 
because of the complexity of the toxic waste charges they faced 
i guess they kind of flimflammed the officials at the jail 
saying they were making mailings out to defense attorneys and 
businesses trying to formulate a defense he said 
the state dumping charges were dismissed in june and the brothers 
have since been transferred to federal prison in otisville ny

president bush and congressional leaders used 
friendly getacquainted sessions with japans new prime minister to 
press his government to do more to relieve the pressures a 50 
billion trade deficit places on the united states 
we know that the health of our relationship partly depends on 
bringing our economic relationship into better balance said bush 
who interrupted his maine vacation friday to meet with toshiki kaifu 
for nearly three hours at the white house 
at a south lawn ceremony kaifu said japan recognized that trade 
imbalances were a cause of friction and said his country would 
continue to make efforts for expanding imports 
at the same time kaifu said the united states must do more to 
reduce its budget deficit increase the rate of savings by americans 
and make us industries more competitive 
bush pointedly told kaifu in office less than a month that he 
shared his belief that while japan is noted as an exporting 
superpower the time has also come for japan to be an importing 
superpower 
later in a speech at the national press club kaifu said japan 
had helped create more than 200000 us jobs through direct 
investment in the united states and criticized recent action by the 
bush administration to target japan as an unfair trading partner 
invoking trade sanctions against japanese products could have a 
negative impact on usjapanese relations the prime minister said 
kaifu employed a softer tone at the white house declaring that 
his country wants to remain a close us ally 
he said he proposed a joint usjapanese effort to combat 
poverty and relieve world hunger to be called the leland memorial 
program for international development to commemorate the late rep 
mickey leland dtexas 
leland was killed in an airplane crash last month while on a 
foodrelief mission to ethiopia 
in a round of meetings at the capitol house majority leader 
richard a gephardt dmo expressed encouragement over the 
progress of usjapanese trade talks 
for the first time we are not talking about specific items over 
which we or they have a grievance he said we are talking about 
the overall reasons why perhaps we have a problem getting products 
into their markets 
but house speaker thomas s foley dwash said sweeping change 
may be difficult to achieve 
the japanese government is facing a political test and i think 
its going to be a difficult period for them in terms of making 
dramatic moves foley said 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas asked kaifu to 
consider further ways his government can aid polands new 
noncommunist government 
i suggested they might take a look at investment 
possibilities and other things they could contribute to polands 
future dole said 
senate majority leader george mitchell of maine said the japanese 
leader appeared to embrace his proposal to set up a joint committee 
composed of members of congress and the japanese parliament to 
explore ways to cooperate in dealing with global environmental 
problems

former first lady nancy reagan withdrew her 
support for a planned drug treatment center and asked the 200 donors 
who pledged 5 million to transfer the money to a foundation bearing 
her name 
mrs reagan believed she was spreading herself too thin 
because she was becoming increasingly involved with her own 
foundation her upcoming book and charitable work on behalf of 
cancer patients her spokesman mark weinberg said friday 
the proposal drew fire from neighbors who complained the 
treatment center would attract drug addicts and could increase 
crime the former first lady announced in may she would likely 
withdraw her support for the center 
the planned residential drug rehabilitation center at a vacant 
hospital building was to have been operated by phoenix house 
this is a major disappointment to us said chris policano 
spokesman in new york city for phoenix house a private foundation 
that operates drug programs across the country there had been no 
prior dissension it was a surprise 
phoenix house notified donors of mrs reagans request but also 
informed them it believes it is legally obligated to use the funds 
for a drug treatment center in the los angeles area 
i dont think theres any legal obligation on the part of 
phoenix house which received gifts to forward them to any other 
charity said assistant attorney general carole ritts kornblum 
who gave an opinion at the request of the drug treatment program 
so far three people who gave a total of 65000 have asked that 
their donations be returned or transferred policano said phoenix 
house hasnt decided what to do with the donations he said

us officials say they are encouraged by 
indications that many latin american democracies are giving the 
diplomatic cold shoulder to the new panamanian government headed by 
a loyal follower of gen manuel antonio noriega 
at least six of the larger latin american countries have no 
ambassador stationed in panama but us officials say some have 
been ambiguous about the reasons for not being represented 
us ambassador arthur davis a political appointee left panama 
in may and president bush said friday that there are no plans to 
send him back 
bush said no diplomatic contacts are planned with the new 
government headed by president francisco rodriguez a friend of 
noriega since high school who served as government comptroller for 
seven years noriega will continue to serve as the behindthescenes 
power in panama 
among the larger latin american democracies only mexico and 
ecuador have ambassadors in panama officials said among those not 
represented at that level are venezuela peru uruguay colombia 
brazil chile and argentina 
the officials insisting on anonymity left open the possibility 
that the recall of one or more of the ambassadors from these 
countries was unrelated to political developments in panama 
the administration on friday used the occasion of the appointment 
of an unelected president in panama to intensify its campaign 
against noriega 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler spoke disdainfully 
of rodriguez who was named to replace his handpicked predecessor 
president manuel solis palma 
noriegas latest puppet president is an unknown within panama 
with no political following whose chief qualification for the 
position seems to have been his longtime friendship with noriega and 
his slavish loyalty to the dictator ms tutwiler said 
noriegas naming of a socalled provisional government is 
completely outside panamas constitution and is in effect a 
thinly disguised coup detat 
an elected president was to have taken office friday but 
panamanian authorities threw out the results of the may 7 national 
elections the state department has said an honest count would have 
shown that the antinoriega candidate won by a 31 margin 
this should have been a proud day for panamanians and for all 
who believe in selfdetermination and democracy bush said in a 
statement instead it is a sad day a sad day for panama and for 
the democratic nations of this hemisphere 
no new economic sanctions were announced by the administration 
but officials are studying the possibility of tightening sanctions 
imposed against panama last year

ford motor co will pay the government a 
92000 penalty for refusing to replace at no cost to its customers 
alleged faulty emission control components on its cars 
while contending that its warranty on the equipment is equal to 
those offered by other automakers ford agreed friday to pay the 
penalty as part of an outofcourt settlement with the environmental 
protection agency 
epa last year cited the company for alleged violations of the 
clean air act for refusing to replace the components at no cost 
the agency said it had received 23 complaints all of which ford 
has agreed to settle also ford will reimburse about 500 other 
vehicle owners who were denied warranty coverage for similar repair 
work epa said 
we feel that our warranty has been competitive with other 
warranties available ford spokeswoman joy stinson said from

warranties must cover emissions hardware for a vehicles useful 
life defined as five years or 50000 miles the agency said

all foods containing residues of alar the 
apple preservative that raised a national furor over possible cancer 
risks will be banned as of may 31 1991 the environmental 
protection agency says 
the agency said friday that it saw no significant health risks 
from eating apples or other food treated with alar but the ban is 
designed to end use of the chemical in response to widespread public 
fears about its safety 
uniroyal chemical co the only domestic maker of alar 
voluntarily agreed in june to take the compound off the market 
although its still being exported the company has disputed 
laboratory findings that the chemical may cause cancer 
the epa reiterated that it plans to announce in january a ban on 
the sale and use of alar after it has received the final results of 
several studies on the chemical 
until the ban becomes effective alars use is still allowed on 
apples cherries nectarines peaches pears peanuts grapes 
tomato transplants and ornamentals 
but to discourage its use the epa said it would begin lowering 
the amount of alar residue permitted on domestic and imported apples 
and other fruits nov 30 with a further reduction a year later and 
a total ban effective may 31 1991 
for tomatoes processed tomatoes tomato pomace meat and meat 
byproducts milk and eggs the ban will take effect nov 30 with no 
phasein period 
alar residues also are found in meat milk and eggs because farm 
animals eat fruit treated with the chemical 
the epa estimates that from 5 percent to 15 percent of the us 
apple crop is treated with alar a growth regulator that improves 
the apples appearance and gives it a longer shelf life 
the agency said friday it believes the use of alar on apples 
declined over the summer because of uniroyals decision to stop 
selling the chemical and a recommendation from the apple growers 
trade association to stop using it 
even so the epa said any apples treated with alar this summer 
could fail to meet the new tolerance levels that take effect nov 30 
and thus could be seized by federal agents

criticisms of us foreign policy made by drug 
czar william j bennett in the draft of his national drug strategy 
have been deleted from the final version an administration source 
says 
the draft of the international section obtained by the 
associated press notes that some andean nations face economic 
instability and political insurgencies that could be made worse by 
us pressure to wipe out drug crops 
in certain areas and circumstances eradication may be the best 
and most costeffective approach to drug crop suppression the 
draft says 
in others it can be selfdefeating driving farmers into the 
ranks of antigovernment insurgency movements or displacing them to 
other areas which cannot be easily reached 
the final version of the strategy to be presented by president 
bush on tuesday wont include these statements the source said 
we thought that would not be an appropriate message to send to 
the international community the source said 
what remains the source said is this statement from the draft 
careful casebycase consideration must be given to eradication 
programs for their potential effect on total country production 
their marginal cost benefit when compared to other counterdrug 
programs in the same country or area and for the political 
consequences of their use 
the source who spoke on condition of anonymity said that 
doesnt cause us any problem because thats something we would do 
anyway you want to look at eradication as a tool not as an end in 
itself 
the peruvian government faces a threat from sendero luminoso 
guerrillas who have virtually taken control of the upper huallaga 
valley the worlds primary cocagrowing region 
the colombian government meanwhile is under attack both by the 
drug traffickers and the m19 guerrilla group 
administration officials have testified before congress that the 
drug traffickers occasionally work with these guerrilla groups to 
protect themselves from the government but such alliances generally 
are those of convenience motivated by geographical proximity and 
joint hostility to the government 
of the three main cocaine producing countries peru colombia 
and bolivia only bolivia faces no immediate threat from a 
guerrilla organization 
the draft also takes issue with us diplomats alleged failure 
to stress the drug issue something congressional critics have been 
concerned about for years 
the draft says that if the united states wants to broaden support 
for its international counterdrug objectives a vigorous 
coordinated public diplomacy program is essential 
the nations programs in this area are overshadowed by the 
absence of importance given the drug issue as a foreign policy 
concern the draft strategy says they remain unconvincing this 
situation is in urgent need of revision 
the draft also called for greater communication with the soviet 
bloc including cuba on the drug issue 
we must be prepared to share our knowledge and our concern with 
the soviet union and eastern european nations and be willing to 
engage them in cooperative counterdrug activities the draft 
strategy says and we should be prepared to take advantage of 
special opportunities provided by other countries with which we may 
have minimal or no diplomatic relationships to control drug 
trafficking 
this could for example include cuba which might effectively 
block rather than facilitate the passage of drugcarrying aircraft 
toward the united states the draft says 
a shortened version of this message remains in the final 
strategy the source said 
catherine shaw a spokeswoman for the state departments office 
of international narcotics matters said the department already has 
begun working more closely with the soviet bloc on the antidrug 
issue 
a letter of agreement with the soviets signed in january by 
thensecretary of state george shultz opens the door for technical 
exchanges shaw said that would mean we could help train 
soviets when they seize drugs to analyze it exchange information 
on cases 
the state department has said it will be willing to work more 
closely with cuba on antidrug measures only after cuba proves its 
interest in cracking down on the trafficking there for example by 
seizing shipments of cocaine headed toward the united states

a judge has denied a new trial for a woman who 
said palimony attorney marvin mitchelson botched her divorce and 
coerced her into having sex with him 
a jury ruled aug 3 that mitchelson had failed to properly manage 
felicia gordons 1984 divorce from her former husband robert 
macdonald but the panel refused to award any money to ms gordon 
saying it found no evidence of negligent or outrageous conduct 
superior court judge jack ryburn confirmed that finding without 
comment thursday 
ms gordon had sought 6 million 
ms gordons attorney malcolm ellis claimed mitchelson was not 
prepared for trial failed to appear at court proceedings and failed 
to gather proper information on macdonalds worth estimated at 
nearly 10 million he said mitchelson appeared in court once to 
request a continuance and to present ms gordon with a 250000 bill 
ms gordon claimed in the civil suit that mitchelson had coerced 
her into a sexual relationship she testified that during a visit to 
mitchelsons office the attorney was wearing a robe with nothing 
underneath and flashed her 
the famed divorce lawyer denied all of ms gordons charges and 
said she was wellrepresented by a colleague while he was bedridden 
with a neck injury 
its a vicious rotten lie mitchelson testified during the 
trial there was no affair there was no solicitation of sex she 
has the wrong person 
mitchelson had countersued ms gordon for legal fees totaling 
127716 but in a separate ruling the jury denied the award 
the celebrity attorney gained fame in the 1970s as the attorney 
who originated the term palimony when he represented michelle

two months of investigation failed to explain 
what happened to small amounts of the radioactive gas tritium that 
may have been lost during shipment to two british companies the 
energy department says 
the material is used in industry for certain research and for 
making luminous lights signs and dials but its main purpose is as 
an ingredient in nuclear warheads 
department spokesman phil keif said the agency is satisfied that 
none of the missing material was diverted for illicit production of 
weapons although a government report released friday said 
investigators couldnt prove there was no diversion 
keif said that of the 5 grams of tritium that were missing when a 
team of energy department and nuclear regulatory commission 
officials began searching in june only a small fraction of 1 gram 
has been accounted for 
the discrepancies were discovered when the british companies 
reported they got less than they ordered 
the department usually sells about 200 grams of tritium to 
commercial users a year raising about 5 million annually 
government information about tritium supplies is classified but 
independent experts estimate that about 4 grams is used in a single 
atomic warhead as a means of boosting its explosive power 
commercial sales were suspended in july because of the 
discrepancies after revamping handling procedures the department 
decided aug 16 to resume sales to all customers except those for 
which shipment discrepancies remained 
keif said the first sales starting aug 25 were to ei du pont 
de nemours amp co 
a new team of energy department tritium experts is pressing the 
investigation keif said but it has been unable to reconcile 
discrepancies in shipments from the oak ridge national laboratory in 
tennessee to surelite ltd and saundersroe developments ltd 
tritium is produced in nuclear reactors at the governments 
savannah river complex near aiken sc 
rep edward markey dmass who has been investigating the 
governments handling of tritium friday released copies of a 
government report that said no reasonably certain explanation 
could be found for discrepancies in tritium shipments to surelite a 
british subsidiary of selfpowered lighting ltd of elmsford ny 
the report did not mention the amount of the discrepancies it 
said they could not be explained by measurement errors losses 
during processing radioactive decay or by residue amounts of 
tritium left in shipping containers

the food and drug administration says paper 
cartons can contaminate milk with cancercausing dioxin but at 
levels too low to pose a health hazard 
milk is safe to drink fda commissioner frank young said 
friday in announcing that the paper industry was changing its 
manufacturing methods 
but because we have the means to virtually eliminate even this 
low level of dioxin it is prudent to do so 
the fda said its tests detected dioxin in milk at levels far 
below 1 part per trillion in chlorinebleached polyethylenecoated 
paper cartons 
the fda estimated the lifetime cancer risk would be less than one 
in a million from consuming milk packaged in paper cartons over the 
next three years to five years even if all milk contained 001 ppt 
of dioxin and 005 ppt of a related but less potent compound called 
tcdf 
the fda said it would monitor the efforts of the paper industry 
to modify production of bleached paper and paperboard so they 
contribute virtually no dioxin to milk 
dioxin and tcdf result from reactions involving chlorine which 
is used to make paper white and to help break down lignin a natural 
material that binds the cellulose in wood 
red cavaney president of the american paper institute said 
about 75 percent of the paperboard for milk cartons is being 
manufactured under the revised process the rest is expected to be 
brought under the new processing techniques within the next 18 
months he said 
processing methods also are being revised for paper used to 
package other foods 
canada and new zealand also have found their milk products to be 
contaminated with very low levels of dioxin the fda said 
the fdas study stems from a national survey of dioxin begun by 
the environmental protection agency in 1983 an offshoot of which 
found dioxin downstream from some paper mills

a newborn giant panda cub was in grave 
condition early today at the national zoo hospital as veterinarians 
and physicians battled to treat a potentially deadly infection 
officials said 
it doesnt look too good at all im sorry to say zoo 
director michael robinson said late friday 
the condition of the cub has worsened and it is now in a 
rather grave condition it has a fever infection has increased and 
weve had to put it in the equivalent of an oxygen tent 
lingling a giant female panda gave birth to her fifth cub 
friday morning all of linglings other offspring have died 
zoo officials said the 4ounce female cub taken from her mother 
and placed in an incubator was suffering from an abundance of white 
blood cells and fluid in her lungs 
robinson said veterinarians and physicians were treating the cub 
with glucose and antibiotics 
if the cub does survive the immediate crisis zoo officials may 
have to raise her something they say has never been done lingling 
may reject the cub if it is kept away too long 
several hours after the birth zoo officials anesthetized 
lingling and took the cub to give her a shot of immunoglobins 
extracted from the blood of the father hsinghsing 
previously officials had been careful not to separate the mother 
from her offspring 
the procedure to ensure a better immune system has been used on 
other animals but never on pandas 
after giving birth lingling nurtured the cub by alternately 
fondling it with her mouth and cuddling it with her massive arms 
the cub occasionally squealed which is considered a good sign 
the 250pound lingling and her newborn were monitored through 
closedcircuit television because lingling was keeping the tiny 
cub pressed close to her body it was almost impossible to see 
the cub was born about 90 minutes after volunteers monitoring 
lingling noticed she was having contractions said zoo spokesman 
mike morgan earlier in the day she was seen gathering more bamboo 
in her nest 
pandas bear twins about 60 percent of the time but zoo officials 
said there were no immediate indications lingling was pregnant with 
another fetus officials said lingling spontaneously aborted a 
fetus in early august 
the birth was the latest chapter in linglings efforts to bear 
offspring in the 17 years that lingling and hsinghsing have lived 
at the zoo the pair have had a variety of troubles mating and 
delivering cubs 
the first cub was born sickly and died three hours after birth 
in 1984 a second cub was stillborn and in 1987 lingling had 
twins the smaller weaker one died almost immediately and the 
second lived about four days before dying of a generalized staph 
infection 
pandas are endangered species fewer than 1000 have been counted 
worldwide 
lingling and hsinghsing were given to the united states by the 
chinese government during president nixons visit to china in 1972 
lingling is a pet name for chinese girls and refers to the sound 
made by the bells they wear on their wrists hsinghsing pronounced 
shingshing refers to the twinkling of a star

a new man wears the presidential sash in 
panama today but the old standoff between the united states and 
strongman gen manuel antonio noriega continues 
francisco rodriguez a 50yearold bureaucrat who has served 
panamas rulers for 20 years was sworn in friday by the head of the 
supreme court as the leader of a provisional government 
the brief televised ceremony was closed to the public and the 
press and noriega did not attend 
rodriguez is panamas sixth president since noriega became head 
of the defense forces in 1983 and with that the nations de facto 
ruler only one president was elected 
the opposition which last year mustered tens of thousands to 
demonstrations was quiet friday the day was declared a holiday and 
the streets of panama city were nearly deserted 
in the only show of discontent opposition leader guillermo 
endara said through a spokesman the fact that gen noriega 
handpicked another president doesnt change the political situation 
of this country 
in washington reaction to rodriguezs swearing in was harsh and 
disdainful 
president bush threatened more sanctions and said the united 
states did not recognize the illegal regime his aides used 
terms like puppet president and talked of rethinking the 
canal treaties 
the united states also did not recognize rodriguezs predecessor 
manuel solis palma whose term as acting president expired friday 
neither this nor a drug trafficking indictment against noriega 
nor economic sanctions that have deprived his government of more 
than 300 million have budged the general 
when the united states called him a drugdealing dictator he 
seized on nationalist sentiments and claimed a yankee plot to renege 
on the treaties handing over control of the panana canal at the end 
of the century 
when international observers said the opposition slate headed by 
endara as the presidential candidate had won the may 7 general 
election the government annulled the balloting 
the united states now hopes to end the 18month standoff by a 
more direct form of economic pressure 
we can make it illegal for any us firm or individual to deal 
with any panamanian company owned by an associate of noriega or 
noriega directly said a us official in panama who asked not to 
be identified 
noriega is said to have extensive business holdings and us 
officials said they expect to make public a blacklist of scores of 
companies owned by noriega or his associates by early next week 
rodriguez and a provisional vice president carlos ozores 
typaldos 49 were appointed by panamas council of state 
the council said the provisional government might call new 
elections if the united states releases panamanian funds 
rodriguez however did not mention new elections in a nationwide 
televised address friday night 
like noriega he blamed panamas political and economic 
predicament on us aggression but his tone was conciliatory and he 
called upon the united states to recognize that a policy of 
kicking panama around doesnt work 
we never have nor are we nor do we wish to be enemies of the 
united states he said

the men meeting this weekend on the 50th 
anniversary of world war ii resemble a group of wellheeled 
retirees but their collective secrets could turn anyones hair 
white 
the 120 former spycatchers were among more than 20000 who 
ferreted out spies and thwarted saboteurs from europe to the pacific 
theater for a secret agency the armys counterintelligence corps 
they arrived in boston last week wearing tiny gold sphinxes as 
tie clasps interviewed during their convention many seemed to 
shrink from the new light cast on their agency 
much of the secrecy surrounding the cic as former agents call 
it ended in 1983 after the capture of nazi war criminal klaus 
barbie in bolivia and his extradition to france a former agent went 
public with the information that the cic had used barbie as a paid 
informant 
the resulting controversy is one that the former agents are 
sensitive about in fact theyre sensitive to just about 
everything none of the agents wore trenchcoats last week but 
theyre still on their guard some would tell war stories others 
wouldnt even give their age 
you people forget we were at war said jack brockway 75 of 
highlands nc one of the 1800 surviving cic agents it was 
kill or be killed im loyal to the united states we had to pay 
barbie he turned in a bunch of nazis 
among themselves the agents swap the kind of stories that sound 
as if they came out of cold warera potboilers 
cic agents were involved in the hunt for japans general tojo 
the elaborate security surrounding dday and the manhattan project 
they also found and brought back to public life konrad adenauer who 
had been under house arrest by the nazis and who later became the 
first chancellor of west germany 
robert c ebaugh jr was 30 when he was used as a decoy for 
president franklin d roosevelt in december 1943 allied leaders 
meeting in tehran had learned that german agents had parachuted into 
the area to assassinate roosevelt 
ebaugh who bore a resemblance to roosevelt rode in the 
presidents car during the fivemile trip from the airport to the 
city wearing roosevelts hat and cape with a cigarette holder in 
his mouth luckily nothing happened 
cic agents were culled from the armys finest according to the 
authors of a justpublished book americas secret army many 
were lawyers journalists and teachers all had to be at least 24 
years old and have an iq of 120 or above 
among the onetime cic agents who did not attend the convention 
were former secretary of state henry kissinger and reclusive author 
jd salinger 
the cic had its origins in the corps of intelligence police in 
world war i a counterintelligence group that all but died out after 
the war it was revived and renamed the cic at the start of world 
war ii 
we were all guinea pigs said brockway there was really no 
organized intelligence for us to go on we did what we had to do and 
made up the laws as we went along 
the cic maintained a low profile during the war that contrasted 
with its rival group the oss or office of strategic services that 
was a forerunner of the cia from 1945 to 1947 during a period 
between the demise of the oss and start of the cia the cic was 
americas only intelligence organization abroad 
cic agents were recalled for the korean conflict but the 
organization was later merged with army intelligence and died out in 
the 1970s

a group that represents fraternities at 900 
college campuses throughout the united states and canada wants to 
eliminate hazing a practice that has led to 40 student deaths over 
the past decade 
hazing has no place in the fraternity experience it is a 
dangerous form of intimidation that makes a mockery of fraternal 
love and were dedicated to eradicating it in the fraternity 
system said jonathan brant executive director of the national 
interfraternity conference 
brant said his group defines hazing as any action or situation 
intended to produce mental or physical harassment embarrassment or 
ridicule 
the national interfraternity conference based in indianapolis 
represents 59 major fraternities with 5155 chapters and more than 
400000 student members in the united states and canada 
brant said the conference had adopted an antihazing resolution 
more than 30 years ago and that most fraternities have had rules 
against hazing for the past two decades 
we are painfully aware that in the past 10 years more than 40 
students have died and hundreds have been seriously injured by 
student organizations in what have been referred to as 
hazingrelated incidents brant said 
the antihazing campaign will involve distribution of printed 
materials on campuses organizing discussion groups at fraternity 
chapters and publishing articles in alumni magazines he said 
fraternity pledging evolved in the late 19th century and was 
meant to be a rite of passage for new recruits before their 
initiation as full members

medicare will pay for routine mammography tests 
to detect breast cancer beginning jan 1 under a regulation proposed

payments for routine physical checkups 
one out of 10 women will develop breast cancer in her lifetime 
according to medical experts and elderly women have the highest 
risk

mayor marion barry wants to meet with attorney 
general dick thornburgh about media reports that federal 
investigators have been told the mayor smoked crack on several 
occasions 
barry said in a letter to thornburgh on friday that disclosures 
concerning the justice departments investigation into his links 
with convicted drug dealer charles lewis have damaged his ability to 
govern 
he said he hoped thornburgh would follow us attorney jay b 
stephens request for a full investigation into the disclosures 
david runkel the justice departments chief spokesman refused 
friday to comment directly on the mayors request but indicated 
that an inquiry is standard in such cases 
stephens declined to comment on whether lewis has implicated 
barry but said he wants the justice department to investigate 
whether stories about lewis cooperation originated with law 
enforcement officials 
local television stations and newspapers have reported that lewis 
told investigators he smoked crack with barry in lewis hotel room 
in december and that federal investigators have said they believe 
they have enough evidence to seek an indictment of barry on perjury 
and obstruction of justice charges 
for the past several years barry has been dogged by rumors that 
he uses drugs on thursday he said again that he never saw or used 
drugs during at least six visits to lewis room

the united states will ship two c130 b cargo 
planes to colombia on sunday as the beginning of a 65 million aid 
package to assist the south american nations fight against drug 
traffickers 
the equipment will be shipped in a sequence designed to allow 
the colombian military to begin to use what we send them 
immediately pentagon spokesman pete williams said friday at a 
news briefing 
williams said the mediumrange c130s would be flown from 
national guard bases in louisville ky and martinsburg wva both 
will carry spare parts 
on monday eight a37 jet planes will be flown to colombia from 
air national guard bases in illinois and michigan the following 
day five uh1h transport helicopters would be ferried down in a c5 
cargo plane from a still undetermined base 
the first equipment to arrive will be that with which the 
colombians are most familiar allowing their forces to move this 
equipment to those locations where it is most needed williams 
said 
president bush said the aircraft and future shipments of us 
weapons to colombia will be used to bring to justice those 
responsible for the scourge of drug trafficking 
colombias government is now engaged in an unprecedented 
crackdown against drug traffickers following the assassination two 
weeks ago of presidential candidate luis carlos galan in response 
colombian drug lords have declared total and absolute war on the 
government 
williams said an undetermined number of bulletproof vests would 
arrive with the helicopters as part of program to protect the 
nations judges and other court officials scores of judges have 
been killed in the past two years and more than 100 judges have 
resigned in fear since colombia launched its latest offensive 
against the drug cartels on aug 18 
ten american servicemen from the us southern commands 
headquarters in panama arrived in colombia on thursday night to aid 
the unloading williams said he said he expected up to 100 defense 
department personnel to take part in the operation 
i would emphasize that we dont expect that they would all in 
be in colombia at the same time he said they will continue to 
come and go as the training schedule and logistic support mission 
demands throughout the duration of this mission 
there was no time limit on the training and it was not known how 
long it will take williams said he stressed that american troops 
will not participate in operations and will not accompany 
colombian personnel on antinarcotics operations 
he said the colombian government will be responsible for the 
security of the american troops adding we do not anticipate that 
us forces will be in an area where security is less than 
adequate 
colombia and the united states reportedly were discussing the use 
of us tactical advisers but williams said that was still up in 
the air he said no decision had been made on whether to send us 
intelligence advisers there 
other us items part of the shipment include trucks small 
boats radios troop support equipment grenade launchers machine 
guns rifles and pistols 
the united states sent colombia a list of equipment available for 
immediate transfer from defense department stocks shortly after bush 
granted the aid the colombians in turn issued their list of 
requests 
its been a matter of making those two lists marry up 
williams said we are moving as quickly as we can

public tv stations wont be scared away from 
the documentary days of rage the young palestinians despite 
claims its onesided and may have been covertly funded by an arab 
group a pbs official says 
twentyfive of the 26 majormarket public stations will carry the 
90minute documentary wednesday public broadcasting system 
spokeswoman mary jane mckinven said friday 
days of rage will be presented as part of a 2hour program 
offering opposing views on the long and bitter palestinianisraeli 
dispute in the west bank and gaza strip 
mckinven said she didnt know how many of the other 300plus 
public stations would carry the program 
controversy obviously is nothing new to public tv she said 
one of the reasons we exist is to do things others would not do 
tv critics and jewish groups have said days of rage produced 
by washington filmmaker jo franklintrout is biased against israel 
in favor of the palestinians 
the antidefamation league of bnai brith said the program was 
full of omissions distortions and inaccuracies 
franklintrout has accused pbs of caving into jewish pressure and 
reneging on several air dates 
wnyc in new york canceled a planned june 5 showing saying the 
movie was pure propaganda mckinven said 
controversy erupted again this week when an article by steven 
emerson in the sept 18 amp 25 issue of the new republic said the 
arabamerican cultural foundation in washington provided 
substantial funds to franklintrout and her pacific productions 
pbs guidelines prohibit editorial control or the perception 
of editorial control by a program funders or promotion of products 
in pbsaired programs mckinven said 
pbs was trying to reach franklintrout to discuss emersons 
assertions mckinven said franklintrout was in europe on business 
friday according to a recorded message on her telephone in 
washington 
if we discover information that the funding was not what it has 
been presented to be we would have to share that information 
with viewers mckinven said 
pbs which is getting days of rage free of charge has the 
option of rejecting programs in advance or not rerunning them if 
covert influence is proved mckinven said otherwise viewers simply 
will be informed of any such controversies and allowed to make up 
their own minds 
emerson said the arab foundation agreed in may 1988 before the 
film was made to provide substantial funds after completion of 
the project if it approved of the end result 
hisham sharabi a georgetown university professor who heads the 
arab foundation told the washington post the aacf furnished no 
funds for the production of the film the foundation had no 
influence or control of any kind on the production of the film 
sharabi confirmed emersons assertion that the foundation had 
agreed to acquire distribution rights after the documentary aired 
after we saw the film in the fall of last year we made a down 
payment or a partial payment of several thousand dollars toward 
the total of under 30000 sharabi said 
franklintrout has said she paid the 180000 cost of the film 
herself 
wednesdays program will be presented by wnet in new york under 
the title of intifada the palestinians and israel it will be 
introduced by hodding carter the former state department spokesman 
in the carter administration who will discuss the controversy 
there also will be wnetproduced segments on israel and the 
palestinian rights issues as well as a panel discussion on days 
of rage by jewish and arab representatives

a private group said today that a us worker 
is 30 times as likely to die on the job as a swedish worker but a 
federal agency cast doubt on the comparison 
the study by the national safe workplace institute also said that 
japanese workers were twice as safe on the job as their american 
counterparts 
the organization compared figures on workplace fatalities for 
seven major industrial countries the united states sweden japan 
west germany france britain and italy 
sweden had the best performance the report said if the 
us had that level of success america would lose 300 men and women 
from occupational injuries each year not the 10700 lives that 
were lost in 1986 
roy clason of the federal occupational safety and health 
administration was critical of the report 
if someone slips on the lunchroom floor and breaks his neck we 
count that as a work fatality clason said i dont know if the 
french do that 
joseph a kinney executive director of the institute said he 
derived his figures from the 1988 statistical yearbook of the 
international labor organization in geneva switzerland the 
chicagobased institute is funded largely by foundations 
the figure of 10700 lives lost in the united states came from 
the national safety council another private group in chicago 
there are no official figures said sy holzman staff 
director of the house subcommittee on health and safety that one 
is the highest of three unofficial figures 
peg seminario who handles health and safety for the aflcio 
said swedish employers spend about 25 times as much on safety per 
worker as we do

tammy faye bakker says she cant understand 
why the government imprisoned and humiliated her tv evangelist 
husband whose psychiatric episode she blames on an allergic 
reaction to medicine 
they stripsearched him in front of a room full of men and 
threw him in a jail cell mrs bakker said after a sixhour 
meeting with her husband ptl founder jim bakker friday night 
jim said it was the most humiliating thing he had ever been 
through 
us district judge robert potter ordered bakker to the federal 
correctional institution at butner for psychiatric evaluation after 
the evangelist broke down thursday in the fourth day of his fraud 
and conspiracy trial in charlotte 
the judge heard bakkers psychiatrist dr basil jackson testify 
that bakker hallucinated when he left the courthouse wednesday after 
a witness fainted 
jackson said he prescribed the antidepressant sedative xanax for 
bakker but his condition worsened until thursday morning he curled 
up in a fetal position in his attorneys office with his head under 
a couch 
there is no reason at all for jim to be in prison mrs 
bakker said speaking of the medication she said he just 
literally had more than he could handle i think judge potter is 
being very unfair 
however the charlotte observer today quoted jackson as saying 
the amount of medication bakker had been given was infinitesimal 
because i recognized his concern about overreaction 
according to the physicians desk reference rare side effects of 
xanax which is similar to valium include hallucinations agitation 
and other behavioral effects 
mrs bakker said her husband is very allergic to all 
medication she said he doesnt even take aspirin 
she said her husband looked much more composed than he had 
thursday when he sobbed on his way to prison 
mrs bakker a gospel singer who has costarred with bakker on 
their talkshow style religious tv programs said bakker did not 
fake his attack as skeptics have suggested 
if you had seen mr bakker you would know he doesnt perform 
hes just jim not a performer she said 
mrs bakker traveled from her home in orlando fla to visit her 
husband she said she would be visiting him daily and hoped he would 
be able to resume his trial next week 
when potter dismissed jurors thursday without telling them why 
the judge said they would not be needed for a week 
government psychiatrists began evaluating bakker on friday said 
prison spokeswoman sharon orr she would not characterize his mental 
state or actions 
normally an evaluation takes 30 to 45 days but it has not 
been determined at this time how long this particular evaluation 
will take she said 
the initial process is a thorough physical in the mental 
health unit a team made up of a psychiatrist and psychologist the 
psychiatric nursing staff a case manager and a personal counselor 
conduct the evaluation she said 
mrs orr said bakker has the option of wearing the standard 
orange prison jumpsuit or street clothes he also is free to roam 
the grounds of the 700acre prison which houses about 800 inmates 
thats his choice because he is not a convicted or sentenced 
prisoner she said 
mrs bakker said her husband described his room as having bars on 
the window he told her that his meals are pushed through a window 
in the door and he has to wear handcuffs every time he comes out of 
his room she said 
butner is one of three federal prison hospitals in the nation 
that do psychiatric evaluations 
bakker accused of using nearly 4 million in ministry funds to 
finance a lavish lifestyle has previously acknowledged suffering a 
nervous breakdown 20 years ago and considering suicide during a 1981 
separation from his wife former ptl workers say bakker was given to 
frequent attacks of anger or depression

appearing on a large television screen overlooking warsaws victory 
square in a broadcast from the vatican 
the memory of world war ii and the local conflicts that have 
been going on for the past 50 years oblige all of us to persist 
in the aim to eliminate war from all parts of the world so it 
ceases to be a tool for resolving disputes the pontiff said in 
his native tongue 
the popes speech was part of an international day of prayer for 
peace in warsaw attended by leaders of the roman catholic church 
and other religions but polands only rabbi stayed away to protest 
the presence of a catholic convent outside the auschwitz 
concentration camp in southern poland

dropping nuclear bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki 
kohl in a speech to the west german parliament in bonn singled 
out the first nation to fall in the war 
we seek understanding between the german and polish peoples 
he said this is our duty and it accords with the yearning of both 
nations 
it is true that too many people in germany and some abroad were 
blinded and deceived by that tyrant kohl said of adolf hitler 
who among us can say with a good conscience that confronted 
with such evil they would have summoned the strength to be martyrs 
and who among us can judge what it meant at that time to risk not 
only ones own life but the lives of ones family as well he

delta air lines officials say they will 
appeal a ruling that faults the flight crew for a 1985 plane crash 
that killed 137 people including the threemember cockpit crew 
us district judge david o belew on friday blamed the crew of 
delta flight 191 for the crash at dallasfort worth international 
airport although he acknowledged that air traffic controllers 
failed to warn the crew of the severity of weather conditions at the 
airport 
the atlantabased airline said the ruling was in conflict with a 
recent jury verdict in fort lauderdale fla that held delta 
blameless in the accident 
delta continues to believe that the facts surrounding this case 
clearly establish total government responsibility for the tragic 
accident the airline said 
the airline had sought to make the government pay all or part of 
the millions of dollars in claims arising from the crash 
belew said delta failed to prove that the two federal agencies 
were negligent in the aug 2 1985 crash of the lockheed l1011 
which was en route from fort lauderdale fla twentyseven 
passengers survived the crash 
the crew has seen lightning identified a thunderstorm and has 
encountered a performance increase in air speed belew said 
there was no explanation for continuing at this point every clue 
the crew had received was worse than the previous one 
this sends a message to delta air lines that the people who 
control the operation of aircraft must be held to the highest 
standards of care said roy krieger a former government lawyer in 
the case who is representing clients suing delta over the august 
1988 crash of a boeing 727 in dallas 
hal monk a fort worth attorney representing some of the victims 
families said from my standpoint the flight crew made a simple 
decision to fly an airplane load of people into a thunderstorm 
delta argued in the 14month trial that government meteorologists 
and air traffic controllers failed to warn the crew of the severity 
of the weather the national transportation safety board ruled that 
the crash was caused by wind shear a dangerous downdraft of air 
associated with severe thunderstorms 
delta already has paid 66 million in damages as a result of the 
case in those cases the plaintiffs waived the liability issue 
sixteen families are continuing to sue delta over the crash 
the government did not escape criticism in belews ruling which 
cited the responses of controllers and meteorologists 
belew said tower personnel should have made sure that incoming 
pilots were aware of weather conditions and that a meteorologist 
should have been sure that the weather was being monitored 
continuously while he took a long dinner break 
but belew cited other cases in which the controllers failure to 
warn pilots of bad weather was not characterized as negligence 
james dillman attorney for the federal aviation administration 
said the controllers would be briefed on the ruling but that no 
formal disciplinary action will be taken 
in washington joe friday assistant administrator for weather 
services at the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
said we are continuing to work with the faa and the aviation 
industry to improve our science and technology so that this kind of 
tragedy will not be repeated 
belew discounted the government contention that delta had not 
adequately trained pilots to handle wind shear situations he called 
deltas training lax but not a factor in the accident 
the judge also ruled out the possibility that tranquilizers capt 
edward m connors might have been taking at the time of the accident 
contributed to the crash 
pilot error also was cited as a cause of a delta crash in 1988 
which killed 14 people the airline has accepted responsibility for 
that crash and fired the flight crew after it was determined that 
the flaps were not set in the proper position for takeoff

a labormanagement proposal to buy ual corp for 
65 billion would put the workers in the corporate cockpit of 
united airlines in the nations largest employeeowned company 
british airways would come on board as a minority owner of the 
company in an arrangement that would put the heads of each airline 
on each others board of directors 
while uniteds directors were pondering the offer of 300 a share 
friday there were reports that investor marvin davis was 
considering topping the offer 
the machinists union which has opposed past employee ownership 
schemes did not say whether it plans to join the current venture 
the machinists are a major issue theyre a potential 
killer to the deal said andrew geller a financial analyst who 
watches the airline industry for provident national bank in 
philadelphia 
ual directors said friday they were reviewing the proposal 
davis a california investor started the bidding on the airline and 
earlier had made an offer of 275 a share or 619 billion 
jim damron a spokesman for uniteds unionized pilots said there 
has been constant contact with the machinists but he would not say 
if that union had moved any closer to joining an employeeownership 
plan first suggested by pilots in 1987 telephone calls to the 
machinists offices went unanswered 
united has more than 70000 employees including about 25000 
members of the machinists union 6300 members of the air line 
pilots association and 12600 flight attendants 
the flight attendants union has said it wants to participate in 
the deal 
mary conway a spokeswoman for davis said he and his advisers 
are studying the situation she refused to comment further 
one industry analyst said he believes the battle for ual is 
basically a twohorse field with the managementemployee group 
having the edge over davis 
it would be awfully hard to see someone else come in at this 
point and make any money acquiring united without liquidating the 
airlines assets said louis a marckesano an analyst with 
janney montgomery scott inc in philadelphia 
some have suggested that davis started the bidding war to jack up 
the price of uniteds stock of which he is a major owner others 
say davis really wants to buy the company 
im more from the former school said analyst geller he 
could make enormous profits but well know in a few days 
ual stock which was trading at about 90 a year ago soared 
1350 to 166 on july 9 in a buying frenzy on takeover talk the 
price went to 21075 when davis put in his first bid and on friday 
it jumped 725 and closed at 287 on rumors of the labormanagement 
offer 
under the proposal british airways would control 15 percent of 
ual stock the employees would agree to unspecified wage concessions 
in exchange for participation in a stock ownership plan that would 
give them 75 percent of the airline 
ual chairman stephen wolf said that under the proposal the 
owners did not contemplate selling any essential assets or revising 
plans for expanding the airline fleet and routes 
british airways said it has agreed in principal to invest 750 
million in the consortium earlier unconfirmed reports indicated 
that the pilots union might invest as much as 1 billion the rest 
of the buyout funding apparently would be borrowed 
the largest us company owned by its employees is avis inc an 
employee stock ownership plan representing 11000 avis workers took 
the car rental company private in a 175 billion buyout in 1987

the 1989 high school football season began 
with a prayer despite a us supreme court ruling upholding a ban on 
such invocations in three southern states 
you bet were going to have a pregame prayer marfa coach 
dub polson said before fridays game against a team from eunice 
nm as long as were supposed to be a godfearing nation i think 
well always have a prayer 
the supreme court in may refused to review an 11th us circuit 
court of appeals ruling that banned organized prayer before football 
games in florida georgia and alabama the court ruled organized 
prayers delivered over a public address system violated the 
constitutional amendment requiring separation of church and state 
the pregame prayer at marfa a west texas community of about 
2500 people was recited without incident it was the first in the 
state since the court ruling 
prayers before games in alabama and florida in defiance of the 
court ruling prompted some protests last weekend 
polson said the schools in district 52a voted unanimously 
thursday at the leagues preseason meeting to hold invocations 
before each athletic contest 
marfa school superintendent carl robinson said the texas 
education agency has not issued a directive concerning pregame 
prayers 
we look to the tea for direction he said we have always 
been in compliance with the law and to my knowledge there is no law 
in the state prohibiting prayer before a game or any activity 
for that matter 
the superintendent also said no one has objected to the tradition 
i think most people appreciate the opportunity to have a moment 
of prayer whether its a parent thinking about a child or the 
child in the stands or on the football field robinson said 
marfa lost the game 340

nine longtime members of the sheriffs 
narcotics division have been suspended after auditors found cash 
missing that was seized in drug raids 
its the first time anything of this magnitude has been 
suspected in this department sheriff sherman block said friday at 
a news conference announcing the suspensions 
block refused to say how much money was missing or whether it 
disappeared at one time or over several drug busts no one has been 
arrested or charged in the investigation which is continuing block 
said 
the los angeles times today quotes a federal official the 
newspaper did not identify as saying we dont know the full 
amount of money at this time it could run into a couple of hundred 
thousand dollars 
the money was not getting to the evidence vault i think they 
took a little each time rather than a major amount 
fbi agent lawrence lawler confirmed the money was missing from 
cash confiscated during drug busts saying it never reached the 
evidence locker he would not provide other details 
the suspensions with pay of the eight deputies and one sergeant 
resulted from a federal investigation prompted by a routine audit in 
october 1988 block said 
the nine narcotics division members who worked together as a 
team had spent nine to 22 years with the department 
since the people work as a team the entire team was placed in 
administrative leave block said 
let me assure you that this incident involved a very small 
number of the 10700 dedicated people in the department block 
said let me also assure you that i will not tolerate the 
corruption of even one of the departments members

the mormon church excommunicated the only 
indian to achieve a high position in its hierarchy after he acused 
church leaders of racism and said the president was too feeble to 
make decisions 
the excommunication of elder george p lee was announced friday 
in a terse oneparagraph statement lees excommunication is the 
first of a mormon church general authority in 46 years 
the communique said lee was expelled for apostasy and other 
conduct unbecoming a member of the church church spokesman don 
lefevre would not elaborate on the statement 
lee said the action stemmed from basic doctrinal disagreements 
with church leaders about the role of american indians in the 
religion and from his contention the leadership is racist 
materialistic and bent on changing the meaning of mormon scripture 
it got to the point where i had to follow them or jesus christ 
and i chose to follow jesus christ lee said in an interview i 
told them they are the ones that are apostatizing teaching false 
doctrine 
lee 46 was made a member of the first quorum of the seventy in 
1975 the leadership group is responsible for administering the 
affairs of the 67 millionmember church under the direction of the 
quorum of the twelve apostles and the church presidency members of 
the allmale leadership are known as general authorities 
in an hourlong meeting with church president ezra taft benson 
bensons two counselors and the twelvemember quorum lee read a 
23page handwritten letter in which he accused fellow churchmen of 
distorting doctrine to satisfy their own racial bias relegating 
indians to secondclass status and denying them their rightful place 
in the faiths theology 
while physical extermination may have been one of the federal 
governments policies long ago your current scriptural and 
spiritual extermination is the greater sin and great shall be 
your condemnation for this lee wrote 
the church believes american indians are the descendants of 
ancient peoples described in the book of mormon published in 1830 
by church founder joseph smith 
lee said prophesies in the book of mormon are clear in defining 
indians and jews as literal descendants of the house of israel and 
all others as gentiles or adopted israel 
in recent years lee said general authorities have been 
preaching that nonindian members are literal descendants of 
ephraim a grandson of israel in the old testament thereby giving 
nonindian mormons an excuse to ignore their indian brothers 
this type of teaching encourages an attitude of superior race 
white supremacy racist attitude pride arrogance love of power 
and no sense of obligation to the poor needy and afflicted lee 
wrote 
he questioned whether other general authorities would remain 
committed to the church if they were not given membership on 
corporate boards royalties from church books and gifts from 
welltodo friends 
lee a navajo and former president of the college of ganado on 
the navajo reservation said the shift in church policy toward the 
indians had occurred after the 1985 death of president spencer w 
kimball 
lee said benson 90 was so enfeebled by age that his counselors 
in the first presidency gordon b hinckley and thomas s monson 
made all important decisions in his name 
the last church general authority to be excommunicated was 
richard r lyman he was excommunicated in 1943 for adultery but was 
rebaptized 11 years later

a millionaire who donated 15 million in 
stocks to the university of utah withdrew the donation after the 
school said it could not rename its medical college and hospital 
after him 
in a letter friday to university president chase peterson james 
l sorenson said he was disappointed with the way the school handled 
the controversy that arose after plans to rename the medical 
facilities were announced 
sorenson said he felt it was unfortunate that the university 
does not want to take any responsibility for its failure to honor 
proposals it conceived when it undertook a prolonged campaign to 
recruit the largest philanthropic gift in the history of the state 
sorensons gift of 250000 shares of abbott laboratories stock 
negotiated with the university over several years was announced in 
may 
protests arose and peterson said in a letter earlier friday that 
it had become impossible to rename the school and hospital after 
sorenson instead he proposed establishing the jl sorenson 
medical institute and endowed chairs in sorensons name 
it seems to me that the universitys desire in recent weeks has 
been more to avoid controversy than to find appropriate uses for my 
endowment sorenson wrote in response 
he said he realized the endowment plan had created substantial 
pressure on the university 
i do not want the siege to continue on my account he said 
adding that he felt the university had in effect adopted a 
leave it or take it attitude 
sorenson saying the gift was perhaps too large for the school to 
handle in one endowment asked for the return of the stock so that 
i can reallocate it to other charitable institutions that are in 
need 
mike mattsson university vice president for development 
apologized for the harm caused through all of this to the sorenson 
family and to the university 
i assume the council will respond to his request and return the 
money mattsson said as i understand the process and release of 
the letter this closes any other options for being explored

a popular lakeside vacation area for 
east germans has turned into a transit point for thousands of 
refugees hoping to make it to west germany under a plan agreed on 
this week between bonn and budapest 
well believe it all only when were over there an east 
berliner said friday using the typical east german shorthand for 
west germany 
on thursday government sources in bonn west germany said 
hungarian and west german officials had devised a plan to allow up 
to 20000 east germans to flee to the west in the next few days 
officials said friday that hungarys red cross already 
accommodating an estimated 3000 east germans in budapest opened a 
new tent city for 3000 more at zanka near lake balaton 
many of the estimated 200000 east germans vacationing in hungary 
are camping around the lake 
the main budapest camp csilleberc was so crowded that new 
arrivals were being bused to zanka said arpad alfoeldi deputy head 
of hungarys red cross 
however he denied a report on the germanlanguage radio station 
danubius that the move was tantamount to evacuation prior to 
shipping the east germans to the west 
east germans some on their way home from black sea vacation 
spots in bulgaria and romania flocked to the three red cross camps 
in budapest after word was leaked of plans for the mass exodus 
karsten voigt foreign affairs expert for west germanys 
opposition social democrats said hungarian communist party 
president rezso nyers assured him that all east germans who want to 
leave hungary for west germany will be able to do so 
hungarys prime minister miklos nemeth and west german 
officials have estimated that up to 20000 east germans in hungary 
want to go to west germany where they receive automatic citizenship 
and assistance in starting a new life 
more than 5000 east germans already have used hungary to escape 
to austria and then to west germany since budapest started 
dismantling fortifications along its western border in may 
between 30 and 40 east germans each day travel illegally from 
czechoslavakia the only country they can visit without permission 
from their government to hungary the hungarian daily mai nap said 
police in west berlin said friday that east german border guards 
had fired shots in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent an east german 
man from fleeing they said the 24yearold man who was not 
identified managed to scale border fortifications and arrived 
unharmed 
also friday security officials in munich said they expected east 
germany to use any mass exodus of east german refugees to slip 
intelligence agents into west germany

insurance companies cannot recover 5 million 
from makers of a western union satellite that was rendered useless 
by a mechanical failure that left it short of its required orbit 
in the first lawsuit involving property damage in outer space 
the 4th district court of appeal dismissed a lawsit filed by five of 
the insurance firms that paid out 105 million after the satellites 
booster rocket failed moments after its deployment from the shuttle 
challenger in february 1984 
attorneys said this weeks ruling likely will further the 
commercial use of outer space by preventing astronomical insurance 
costs for cargo 
if the insurers had been allowed to seek reimbursement of claims 
paid on their clients losses in space manufacturers said they 
feared a resulting flood of costly court cases that would greatly 
reduce incentives for commercial space exploration 
the westar vi communications satellite launched by challenger was 
supposed to reach an orbit 22000 miles above the earth it was 
designed to last 12 years and handle telephone transmissions and 
television and computer data 
but four seconds after the satellites rocket ignited its nozzle 
disintegrated and its motor shut down that stranded the satellite 
at an altitude of 655 miles where it was useless 
when western union bought the rocket from mcdonnell douglas 
astronautics co a huntington beach subsidiary of mcdonnell douglas 
corp the two companies signed a contract barring any lawsuits 
between western union and mcdonnell douglas its contractors or 
subcontractors 
mcdonnell douglas subcontracted work on the rockets motor to 
morton thiokol co of chicago and work on its nozzle to hitco of 
gardena calif 
western union fully insured the satellite and the insurance 
companies paid western union the 105 million value of the satellite 
after the launch failed 
appalachian insurance co and four other insurers who paid out 
about 5 million of that sum sued mcdonnell douglas morton thiokol 
and hitco charging negligence and asking for the return of the 
plaintiffs money 
superior court judge tully h seymour ruled in january 1987 that 
the sales contract between western union and mcdonnell douglas 
prohibited the insurers from getting the money back 
the threejudge appeals panel agreed unanimously

of residents who fled the barrages slipped back into the smoldering 
city to check on homes and friends 
police said one person was killed and 18 wounded in the fighting 
raising the casualty toll from nearly six months of daily shelling 
to at least 824 killed and 2438 wounded 
the fighting broke out again before dawn today after a fourhour 
lull eighteen people were killed and more than 100 wounded in 24 
hours of nonstop shelling that eased at midnight friday leaving 
buildings on fire and streets choked with rubble 
todays shelling was heaviest in the hillside druse moslem 
shweifat suburb on beiruts southeastern edge as christian leader 
gen michel aouns gunners zeroed in on the area where the syrians 
have deployed longrange artillery 
on friday salvos of rockets were fired from shweifat on the 
besieged 310squaremile christian enclave north of beirut 
the estimated 1 million christians in the enclave have been 
besieged by the syrian forces and their militia allies for nearly 
six months 
despite radio warnings thousands of moslems who fled to southern 
lebanon for safety in recent weeks returned to beirut to check on 
their homes and businesses after fridays savage bombardment 
the barrages that began march 8 have forced all but an estimated 
10 percent of beiruts 15 million residents to flee the devastated 
city and seek refuge in southern lebanon the bekaa valley in the 
east and mountain resorts northeast of the capital 
the coastal highway linking beirut with the south was jammed 
today with thousands of vehicles heading for beirut but others were 
fleeing south as smoke billowed from the wooded hills around 
shweifat 
amin jirdi a druse who lives in shweifat said the area was 
literally ploughed by shellfire from aouns usmade 155mm 
artillery during the night 
he said the christian gunners deployed in the baabda hills 
overlooking shweifat fired a shell at every street and every 
corner they can see the whole area and they raked it with fire 
jirdi who was fleeing south with his wife and two daughters 
said the shelling destroyed houses shops and businesses 
several fires blazed out of control though the night we 
sheltered in a basement until early this morning when the shelling 
decreased and we managed to get out he said 
jirdi was interviewed at the key road junction at khaldeh three 
miles south of shweifat as he drove the family sedan loaded with 
mattresses blankets and clothes out of the battle zone 
his wife mounifa her eyes brimming with tears said this is 
all we were able to pack it seems well be away from our home for a 
long time 
militiamen of druse warlord walid jumblatts syrianbacked 
progressive socialist party stopped civilians from driving into 
shweifat saying christian militiamen in the hills were shooting 
at everything that moves 
but as the crackle of automatic fire was heard from the 
brushcovered hills above khaldeh beirutis flocked back into the 
devastated capital where gutted apartment blocks still smoked 
ill leave again as soon as i find out what happened to my 
apartment said ibrahim fatha who lives in the bourj abu haidar 
district of moslem west beirut 
other people heading into the city also said they were only going 
to inspect property and check on relatives before returning south 
where tens of thousands of beirutis are camped out on the roadside 
in cars and makeshift tents fashioned from plastic sheets tied to 
trees 
the current round of fighting in lebanons 14yearold civil war 
broke out march 8 after aoun seeking to restore the governments 
longeroded authority blockaded illegal ports south of beirut run 
by syrianbacked militias 
the syrians and their moslem and leftist allies retaliated by 
besieging the christian enclave 
beiruts influential annahar daily said the fighting of the last 
few days indicates that french and soviet efforts to find a 
settlement to the lebanese crisis have reached a dead end 
gennady tarasov head of the soviet foreign ministrys middle 
east department and francois scheer secretarygeneral of the 
french foreign ministry have shuttled between beirut damascus and 
other arab capitals over the last two weeks seeking to mediate an 
end to the fighting 
but like an arab league mediation committee before them their 
efforts have so far failed to secure a ceasefire

president hashemi rafsanjani has resigned 
as commanderinchief of irans armed forces saying he is too busy 
with other matters tehran radio reported today 
rafsanjani resigned in a letter to ayatollah ali khamenei who 
took over as the islamic republics spiritual leader after ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini died june 3 the staterun radio said in a report 
monitored in nicosia khamenei accepted rafsanjanis resignation 
the radio said it gave no other details 
khomeini appointed rafsanjani as commanderinchief in june 1988 
after iranian forces were defeated by the iraqis in a series of 
offensives in the persian gulf war rafsanjanis main task was to 
reorganize irans military badly demoralized by the battlefield 
setbacks and nearly eight years of war 
the disarray in the fractious military the shortage of weapons 
and growing war weariness among irans 50 million people after 
horrendous casualties led him instead to persuade khomeini to 
unconditionally accept a 1987 un security council ceasefire 
resolution that took effect aug 20 1988 
the resignation of ransanjani 55 as irans military chief 
indicates he will focus his priorities on his declared policy of 
revitalizing irans sagging economy and the huge task of postwar 
reconstruction 
khamenei will presumably now take over as commanderinchief 
khamenei 50 rafsanjanis political ally made it clear soon after 
he was elected to succeed khomeini that he intended to control 
military affairs 
rafsanjani with wide support in the 350000strong revolutionary 
guards corps will retain considerable influence in military affairs 
during his tenure as commanderinchief he also served as 
parliament speaker at the time he merged the command structure of 
the regular army and the revolutionary guards to eliminate parallel 
and often conflicting chains of command that seriously hampered 
military operations during the gulf war 
akbar torkan the minister of defense and armed forces logistics 
in rafsanjanis new cabinet will wield more control of military 
affairs than any of his predecessors following the merger approved 
by parliament in july 
torkan a close rafsanjani aide was head of irans defense 
industries organization during much of the war and was a driving 
force behind building it up to produce surfacetosurface missiles 
and other weapons to counter a usled arms embargo he will now 
try to expand the defense industry 
rafsanjanis interior minister hojatoleslam abdullah nouri 
controls internal security forces he was khomeinis powerful 
representative at revolutionary guards headquarters and wields 
considerable influence in the corps and is wellplaced to counter 
any challenge to rafsanjani leader of tehrans socalled 
pragmatists from radical rivals 
rafsanjani was elected july 28 with a landslide vote to succeed 
khamenei president since 1981 
he was given unprecedented executive powers through 
constitutional reforms aimed at eliminating competing power centers 
that have paralyzed the decisionmaking process overwhelmingly 
approved in a national referendum

baseball academia and president bush 
memorialized a bartlett giamatti as a man with high standards and a 
common touch as at home in the bleachers as in the company of 
scholars 
giamatti died friday at age 51 after apparently suffering a heart 
attack at his vacation home on the resort island of marthas 
vineyard 
his death came five months after he became baseball commissioner 
and eight days after he banned pete rose baseballs alltime hit 
leader for betting on the game 
while his commissionership is tragically a very very very 
short one it will be remembered as a meaningful one milwaukee 
brewers president bud selig said 
among those who had praise for giamatti were rose yale 
professors baseball owners and some of the players whom he had 
ordered suspended during an earlier tenure as national league 
president 
some suggested that the rose affair had taken a toll on giamatti 
a chainsmoker who called cigarettes his primary vice 
he wrestled with all of baseballs problems said new york 
yankees owner george steinbrenner who talked to giamatti by phone 
45 minutes before he was stricken it may have all come in on him 
im not a man who cries but i cried today 
president bush a fellow alumnus of yale university where 
giamatti was president from 1978 to 1985 said the two were close 
friends and had talked at length about the rose case and all 
through that i was thinking of the difficulty that he had in setting 
these standards that high and staying with it 
in an aug 18 interview with the associated press giamatti 
brushed aside the notion that he was overstressed by the rose 
matter while its a serious matter it doesnt take most of the 
time he said 
giamatti was found unconscious in his bed and in full cardiac 
arrest when officers responding to a call from one of his sons 
arrived at 3 pm giamatti was pronounced dead about an hour and a 
half later said matthew stackpole of marthas vineyard hospital 
giamattis body was taken to falmouth mass this morning where 
an autopsy was to be performed 
rose was deeply saddened by the news of giamattis death 
roses attorney robert a pitcairn said in a statement issued in 
cincinnati in spite of their dispute pete had great personal 
respect for the commissioner he said 
rose can apply for reinstatement after a year and it will be up 
to giamattis successor to rule on it 
baseballs executive council composed of the two league 
presidents and seven club owners will rule the game until a new 
commissioner is chosen 
giamatti became baseballs seventh commissioner on april 1 
succeeding peter ueberroth after serving as national league 
president since december 1986 he served 154 days of his fiveyear 
term 
barts legacy will be greater than the pete rose episode 
said jerry reinsdorf chairman of the chicago white sox board 
bart brought the owners together bart liked everybody his way of 
liking everybody got us to like each other 
montreal pitcher kevin gross was among several players suspended 
by giamatti when he was national league president 
he did what he felt he had to do but he did it as a perfect 
gentleman i saw him the next year at the allstar game he told me 
that he was glad to see me there and he wished me the best and was 
real nice to me and my family gross said 
giamatti was remembered as being as comfortable speaking to yale 
groundskeepers with whom he would attend red sox games as he was 
to the scholars who shared his passion for 16th century engish 
poetry 
bart did not forget the secretary who had once typed his 
letters said yale professor thomas greene 
said st louis cardinals manager whitey herzog for being book 
smart i thought he had a lot of street smarts which is tough to 
find sometimes 
giamatti said of baseball i always found it the most 
satisfying and nourishing of games outside of literature 
born in boston on april 4 1938 giamatti was only 40 when he 
became yales youngest president in 200 years he had joined the 
yale faculty in 1966 after teaching italian and comparative 
literature at princeton university 
giamatti is survived by his wife toni and three children 
marcus bartlett paul edward valentine and elena walton giamatti

a court today convicted 26 moslem extremists 
on charges stemming from assassination attempts on two former 
cabinet ministers and a journalist and sentenced them to prison 
terms ranging from one year to life 
the 17month trial was part of an extended government crackdown 
on fundemantalists that began in 1981 when president anwar sadat was 
assassinated and the attack was blamed on a fundamentalist group 
the cairo court sentenced five of the defendants all moslem 
activists to life imprisonment the other 21 convicted defendants 
received from one to 10 years in prison seven people were acquitted 
prosecutors had demanded the threeman state security court 
sentence 15 of the defendants to death by hanging 
court president omar eloteify read the judgment at a brief 
morning court session without specifying the exact charges the 
defendants were convicted of 
in the indictment prosecutors had also charged the defendants 
with forming an illegal paramilitary organization called salvation 
from hell to destabilize the government through assassination and 
other means 
as the court president finished reading the judgment some 
defendants shouted from the cages in which they were restrained 
we will kill the judge this is a plot against islam and 
injustice some women in the audience many veiled in strict 
islamic fashion from head to toe except for eyeslits wailed and 
screamed as the chief judge read out the judgment 
my son my son screamed a woman as she threw herself on the 
bars of a cage where defendants were confined 
discussing the verdict later with reporters eloteify said seven 
of the defendants agreed to form an illegal party and to declare 
egypts rulers and society infidel they called for jihad to set 
up an islamic state by force 
for many fundamentalist moslem extremists moslems with different 
interpretations of the faith are infidels who can be killed at will 
once jihad or holy war has been declared 
all the defendants had pleaded innocent to charges of active 
participation or collusion in the murder attempts in 1987 on former 
interior ministers hassan abubasha and elnabawy ismail and editor 
makram mohammed ahmed 
the attempts against the ministers are believed to have been 
meant as retaliation for crackdowns on moslem militants during their 
earlier tenures at the interior ministry which handles domestic 
security 
ahmed who edits the stateowned weekly almussawar and is a 
confidant of president hosni mubarak was targeted after he wrote a 
series of scathing articles condemning extremist terror 
all three attempts involved shootings with automatic weapons from 
cars abubasha was wounded seriously ahmed suffered a minor hand 
injury and ismail was uninjured 
moukhtar nouh a defense lawyer said he would present a petition 
asking for a reduction in the sentences or a retrial under the law 
the judgment is subject to confirmation by mubarak 
three of those who received life terms are in custody yousri 
abdelmoneim 30 and amin abdullah gomaa 32 both unemployed and 
adel moussa attiya 29 a nurse the other two magdi elsafty and

were in buses passing by 
the bombing occurred as colombia awaited the arrival sunday of

communications unit to coordinate the arrival of the military 
equipment said the source who is working with the us advisers 
he denied reports that us military aid already had arrived in 
colombia

america for its staunch opposition to government corruption and 
human rights violations the newspaper had been publishing stories 
calling for stronger action against drug traffickers

not needed to fight the war against drug lords 
we can face this challenge alone gen oscar botero said

responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine that is smuggled into the

defused a 40pound bomb left at a bank friday by terror squads

anonymity told american reporters in bogota that colombias 12 top 
drug lords may be hiding in colombia and perhaps have bribed

the official said drug cartels may have people stationed in small 
towns watching for military or police movement army colonels can 
make up to 15000 monthly working for drug dealers he said

approved by president bush it will give colombia two c130 
transport planes five uh1h combat helicopters and eight a37 jets

washington this week that the country could use an additional 19 
million in equipment

killed the leading presidential candidate and the top police 
official in medellin aug 18

the collapse of peace talks just a month 
before vietnam says it will withdraw its troops from cambodia may 
have guaranteed a new period of bloodshed for that turbulent land 
the 19nation peace talks that ended in paris on wednesday 
offered an opportunity to end nearly 11 years of war but 
negotiators could not overcome the deepseated hostility between the 
vietnameseinstalled government and the khmer rouge the largest 
member of the guerrilla coalition 
the hosts of the paris conference france and indonesia are to 
begin consultations within six months to arrange a second round of 
talks other diplomatic initiatives will continue 
interviews with two dozen officials in vietnam and cambodia 
produced both hopeful and gloomy predictions but it is certain the 
nature of the conflict will change after sept 26 when vietnam says 
it will withdraw the last of its 26000 soldiers 
that could mean increased attacks by the khmer rouge which 
killed hundreds of thousands of people before vietnam invaded in 
late 1978 and ended its rule the pullout also is to happen at the 
beginning of the dry season when combat usually intensifies 
many of our cambodian friends are worried said a western aid 
official in cambodias capital phnom penh the government is 
painting an optimistic picture the people are less optimistic about 
the governments ability to hold off the khmer rouge 
the khmer rouge responded to vietnams pullout of 50000 troops 
in 1988 with new attacks to try to seize strategic areas said gen 
tran cong man editor of the official vietnamese army newspaper 
quan doi nhan dan 
he reported major fighting since december in the area of pailin 
in western battambang province bordering thailand he said the 
guerrillas were trying to establish a liberated zone and set up 
a competing government 
sometimes they temporarily occupy some points but later they 
are thrown back at pailin man said in an interview he said it 
was at pailin at the beginning of this year that vietnamese troops 
last participated in significant infantry combat 
man said that after vietnams pullout the khmer rouge also will 
target two other provinces bordering thailand koh kong and siem 
reap 
the khmer rouge think that if they can occupy these three 
provinces they can reverse the situation he said 
vietnamese and cambodian officials insist the guerrillas pose no 
real threat to the phnom penh government and eventually will disband 
if china and thailand reduce military aid as they have indicated 
they will man said the thai army already has halted artillery and 
reconnaissance aircraft support for the khmer rouge 
in an interview phnom penhs vice prime minister kong samol 
said his government could not resolve the impasse because we have 
given all our concessions but diplomats say hanoi and phnom penh 
still want a political settlement because only that can guarantee an 
end to the international isolation that has stunted their economies 
most noncommunist nations will continue to recognize the 
resistance coalition and shun phnom penh until the guerrillas share 
power china and the united states have made increasingly clear they 
want an acceptable settlement not just a vietnamese pullout 
before considering normalization of relations with vietnam 
a western ambassador said vietnams foreign minister nguyen co 
thach told him that based on his talks with chinese officials in 
paris it appeared beijing may budge on the issue 
thach had the impression the chinese would move to a position 
of a kind of participation by the khmer rouge but not as complete a 
role as before the ambassador said 
an east european diplomat in phnom penh said it was possible that 
prince norodom sihanouk leader of the threemember guerrilla 
coalition could drop the khmer rouge if china decides to rely on 
him instead of the khmer rouge to represent its interests in phnom 
penh 
the communist khmer rouge has the strongest fighting force in the 
guerrilla resistance 
sihanouk 67 knows he must move soon each day the former ruler 
of cambodia grows older people remember him less and perhaps most 
importantly the phnom penh government boosts its international 
standing 
after this months pullout a key resistance argument will begin 
slipping away that phnom penh is a vietnamese puppet propped up 
by vietnamese troops 
for the first time some diplomats say it is very possible that 
australia thailand and other nations will recognize phnom penh even 
without a political settlement if it holds internal elections and 
can hold off the khmer rouge

police with ak47s stand guard at the gates and 
watchtowers electricity courses through a wire fence surrounded by 
a 15foothigh brick wall 
security is tight at beijing prison no 1 but the real controls 
are psychological two hours of daily ideological study mandatory 
writing of confessions and the knowledge that even if one fled 
hiding would be difficult in the tightly policed society outside 
this gray compound on beijings educate the new street is where 
the capitals most serious offenders are sent and where some of the 
more than 2000 beijing residents arrested in the june crackdown on 
dissent can expect to go 
we havent received any of those criminals yet vice warden 
song wenpo said walking past neat whitewashed cells they are 
still being investigated but very likely some will come here 
they will join about 2000 prisoners including murderers 
thieves and about 20 counterrevolutionaries who spend their 
days making plastic sandals and nylon socks and learning to reform 
through labor 
clad in blueandwhite uniforms with the word prison stamped 
over the right breast the inmates work in small prison factories 
much like factories outside poorly lit noisy with aging 
machinery and numerous safety hazards 
vice warden song fell into a hole in the floor that had been 
covered with a thin rubber mat for long embarrassed minutes he 
struggled to free his foot while an aide whispered that perhaps 
hed best take off his shoe 
the workshops women prisoners hid grins two clutched each 
other trying to suppress giggles finally free song called over a 
trustee and ordered the hole fixed 
physical security inside the prison is light the guards dont 
carry guns and there are no barriers among the welter of drab 
workshops cellblocks hospital and office buildings but with more 
than one staffer for every four inmates supervision is close 
there are some inmates who resist reform resist labor 
song said they are punished according to the law 
they may get a demerit on their record or criticism and 
education by their 11 cellmates during daily political study song 
said 
or they may be put in the little number a cell too small to 
lie down fully where the light is never turned off according to 
former prisoner yang jing who said he spent 10 months in the cell 
song denied such a cell exists 
yang spent eight years in beijing prison no 1 for helping print 
a reformist magazine during the 197879 democracy wall movement one 
of the predecessors of this springs massive student marches 
senior leader deng xiaoping crushed it as he did the 
prodemocracy protests in early june 
yangs magazine coeditor xu wenli is still at prison no 1 in 
his fourth year of solitary confinement song said solitude was 
beneficial to xus individual reform 
he recognizes some of his problems but im afraid there must 
still be a process of reform song said 
police and courts have refused comment on the status of students 
intellectuals and workers arrested in this years movement song 
said he believes most still are in police detention cells being 
investigated 
chinese sources say some including a few prominent 
intellectuals are held in a prison that officially doesnt exist 
qincheng prison in beijings western suburbs others such as ousted 
communist party chief zhao ziyang are said to be under house arrest 
there is no limit on detention pending trial and many of the 
protesters may never be tried according to pan shizhao director of 
the beijing bar associations research department 
he said many likely will be given labor education a sentence 
that can be handed down by police without a court appearance 
pan said the law requires that police notify families within 24 
hours of detention and sets a sevenday limit for holding suspects 
without charging them but the new yorkbased international league 
for human rights reported to the united nations that these rights 
are often being waived for the recent prodemoncracy protesters 
courts have been ordered to sentence protesters severely and 
even defense lawyers have been urged to play an active role in 
cracking down on the protesters 
many protesters shown under arrest on national television were 
bruised from beatings but song said this rarely happens in his 
prison and that culprits are punished if prisoners think their 
rights are being abused he said they can come directly to me 
pan asked if lawyers could intervene to protect prisoner rights 
looked baffled in prison the convicts duty is to obey prison 
rules he said he is there to reform his thinking 
most do song said only 5 percent of those released commit 
crimes again 
those jailed for political activities also usually try to stay 
out of trouble some released democracy wall activists now sell 
clothing on the private market yang released in april said he 
planned to paint 
democracy wall activist ren wanding released in 1983 was a rare 
exception he broke a long silence in november to distribute essays 
denouncing human rights violations and commemorating democracy wall

the federal agency responsible for correcting 
dangerous automobile defects has halted 25 investigations covering 
37 million vehicles in the past eight years under industry pressure 
a private watchdog organization charged saturday 
four of the probes were abandoned this year by the national 
highway traffic safety administration according to the center for 
auto safety the center founded by consumer advocate ralph nader 
frequently accuses the government of lax automobile regulation 
they are carrying out a predetermined policy to get the 
government off the backs of the car companies said clarence 
ditlow the groups executive director our feeling is the public 
is literally riding at risk of death or injury in these 37 million 
vehicles 
tim hurd spokesman for nhtsa said ditlow had issued almost the 
same statement three years ago its not the first time theyve 
been critical of us and im sure its not the last hurd said 
the agency denies the allegations he said each of the 
investigations referred to was closed for good reason after an 
extensive investigation by nhtsa engineers 
in each of the 25 aborted investigations nhtsa had requested 
auto manufacturers to conduct safety recalls but was refused 
according to a center for auto safety statement each time the 
agency discontinued its probe after being rebuffed the statement 
alleged 
the vehicles under investigation collectively had experienced 
2176 accidents resulting in 653 injuries 29 deaths and 106 fires 
it said 
ditlow acknowledged nhtsa sometimes stops investigations after 
finding insufficient evidence to proceed but said the cases his 
group was targeting should have been pursued further 
were talking about when an agency writes a letter asking for a 
recall and they the manufacturer say no and the agency closes the 
case out ditlow said 
hurd said nhtsa never stops an investigation because an automaker 
refuses to issue a recall in each case ditlow mentioned the agency 
decided a recall was not justified hurd said 
this year the agency has ordered 123 recalls involving 36 
million vehicles he said the trend toward ordering recalls has 
been upward since 1983 hurd said 
among the vehicles nhtsa stopped investigating were 456000 ford 
vans and trucks with dual rear wheels manufactured between 1977 and 
1984 despite complaints that the wheels came off the center said 
also the agency abandoned investigations of 50000 thomas built 
buses from 1978 to 1986 that allegedly were susceptible to splitting 
apart in crashes and 2 million 197882 chrysler omnihorizon kcars 
subject to stalling because of defective carburetor isolator plates 
the center said 
in each case deaths and injuries were blamed on the alleged 
defects the group said 
this year the center charged nhtsa prematurely stopped 
investigating 
rear brake lockup in 19 million 198185 general motors xcars 
for which 518 acidents 168 injuries and nine deaths were blamed 
rear brake lockup in 450000 ford mustangcapris made in 1979 
blamed for 100 accidents 40 injuries and seven deaths 
rear brake lockup in 27 million 198285 general motors acars 
blamed for 388 accidents 125 injuries and seven deaths 
seats falling backward in 56 million 198186 ford

the government on saturday accused a un panel of 
brazenly interfering in chinese affairs by criticizing the june 
crackdown on prodemocracy protesters 
the official xinhua news agency also quoted a government 
spokesman as saying the crushed movement would never be regarded as 
anything but a counterrevolutionary rebellion 
the un subcommittee on prevention of discrimination and the 
protection of minorities adopted a resolution thursday appealing to 
china to grant clemency to arrested protesters 
the resolution brazenly interfered in chinas internal 
affairs chinas foreign ministry said in a statement read on the 
official radio and television 
china claimed the un resolution was engineered and instigated 
by a few western members 
it was sponsored by panel members from the united states 
britain france the netherlands norway japan mexico and the 
philippines 
the resolution urged the un human rights commission to 
investigate the chinese crackdown it was the first time that human 
rights questions in one of the five un security council 
membercountries was referred to the commission the uns highest 
human rights body 
xinhua said china has all along attached importance to human 
rights 
however it said the government was driven beyond the limits of 
forbearance by student protestors who repeatedly occupied 
beijings tiananmen square during seven weeks of protests that began 
april 15 
troops were called in to put down the protests killing hundreds 
perhaps thousands of civilians on june 34 since then thousands 
of people have been arrested and at least 12 people have been 
executed for taking part in the protests 
xinhua also quoted government spokesman yuan mu as saying any 
attempts to reverse the verdict on the movement will never 
succeed 
it is absolutely impossible for the case to be redressed he 
said reiterating the official line that the protests sought to 
overthrow the government and the ruling communist party 
in an interview in saturdays china daily education vice 
minister he dongchang said chinas opendoor policy which includes 
sending thousands of students overseas helped bring about the 
democracy movement 
openness should alternate with closure he said windows 
cannot be opened with no screen to keep flies and worms from coming 
in freely 
during the past 10 years 80000 chinese students have left to 
study abroad but only one quarter have returned 
china has announced plans to reduce the amount of time some 
students are allowed to stay aboard

william j bennett has yet yet to follow 
through on pledges to give special attention to the district of 
columbias escalating drug problem district offficials complain as 
his national drug control policy is about to be released 
when bennett became the bush administrations drug czar in 
january he praised the citys police department but bluntly said 
that mayor marion barrys government wasnt solving the citys drug 
problem 
that criticism was tempered however by his promise to make the 
district a national test case for a federal urban drug control 
strategy a plan he had hoped to release within 90 days 
but nine months and more than 250 killings later city officials 
say theyre still alone in fighting the citys drug war 
he hasnt delivered on his promises barry said at a recent 
news conference we havent seen anything 
as the citys murder rate continues to soar the districts 
national guard division is lending the police department 
sophisticated surveillance equipment for use in tracking drug 
dealers but the extra drug enforcement administration agents barry 
requested havent materialized 
us attorney jay b stephens has hired more than a dozen extra 
prosecutors who are specifically charged with handling drugrelated 
murder cases but money for extra police and police overtime that 
barry requested from bennett and congress hasnt been delivered 
portions of bennetts national plan have been leaked in recent 
weeks but there has been no word on whether the comprehensive 
strategy will include any specific help for the nations capital 
bennett aides did not return four telephone calls about the plan 
over the past several months bennett has made no secret of his 
disdain for barry and his government saying at one point that the 
democratic mayor and other city officials arent doing all they 
can to battle the citys drug problem he also said recurring 
allegations that barry himself used drugs havent helped the 
situation 
but if barry and bennett cant seem to work together the bush 
and barry administration drug czars might get along better 
sterling tucker picked by barry six weeks ago to coordinate the 
citys drug battle favors a lowcost program aimed at getting the 
community involved in the drug fight 
he has been very busy meeting with community leaders and 
business trying to enlist their support said tucker spokeswoman 
cynthia harris said he hasnt focused heavily on federal 
initiatives 
but tuckers plan to formally announce his program was scuttled 
amid new allegations this past week that barry and a convicted drug 
dealer used drugs together when barry visited the mans hotel room 
last december barry vehemently denies ever having used drugs 
the national conference of mayors has asked bennett for a 
16point package that stresses interdiction at americas borders and 
the destruction of drug crops in central and south america the 
plan which has barrys backing also calls for more federal funding 
for local and federal antidrug programs and tougher prosecution of 
drug dealers

white house staffers are making an 
allout effort to get the words setting and atmosphere of president 
bushs drug strategy speech just right in hopes he will go over well 
in his first televised address to the nation 
the tuesday night address will mark the first time in his more 
than seven months as president that bush will take to the airwaves 
for a formal speech to america a practice used often and 
successfully by his predecessor onetime actor ronald reagan 
cognizant that speaking to people in their living rooms requires 
specialized communication skills the white house is working 
overtime to make sure it goes right 
bush aides have agonized over every phrase of the speech working 
with expert consultants toplevel advisers and the president 
himself who went over the latest draft and made suggestions when he 
was in washington friday to meet with the new japanese prime 
minister 
he is very interested in making sure that the substance of the 
strategy comes through and its not overweighted rhetorically 
said white house communications director david demarest who is in 
charge of the overall planning for the speech 
it is being written by mark davis who wrote the acclaimed speech 
bush delivered in mainz germany last spring in which he challenged 
the soviet union to tear down the iron curtain 
demarest and davis have consulted with cabinet members drug 
policy coordinator william bennett and other advisers in working 
toward a final version for a dress rehearsal monday afternoon when 
the president returns to the white house from his vacation 
one detail getting a lot of consideration and still unresolved 
was where the president will sit to make the speech 
the obvious choice is the oval office but aides said there was 
some sentiment for using a less formal setting a study or office 
in the residence part of the white house 
other items occupying the planners attention what should be in 
the background what should be on his desk top if he sits at a desk 
what color suit and shirt will he wear 
bushs campaign media coach roger ailes was asked for tips on a 
draft of the speech and officials hoped he would be on hand to give 
bush some coaching on presentation 
ailes coached bush through his campaign debates with democrat 
michael dukakis and developed his campaign tv message 
aides want to make sure bush gets comfortable with the tv 
teleprompter which has a different feel from those used in a 
ballroom for instance and that he practices the more intimate 
speech cadences that will serve him better than a stump speaking 
style 
the speech itself will contain no dramatic proposals that have 
not already been mostly aired in news accounts said one official 
the president will announce a 78 billion program that will 
focus on stepped up enforcement and treatment on the domestic level 
and will contain a newly increased emphasis on helping the andean 
countries fight the drug lords who produce and market narcotics 
bush wants the speech to lay out enough specifics of the plan so 
viewers get a sense the government is intent on more than just 
rhetoric officials said 
this has got to be a speech that reaches out to people on a 
personal level but at the same time youll find that it does lay 
out the specifics of the plan said one source who has seen the 
drafts 
the speech emphasizes the comprehensive broadbased nature of 
the drug problem said the official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
demarest said the white house is trying to strike a balance 
between substance and arresting language 
people want to know there is a strategy to know that it is 
comprehensive and that it is credible and to the point he said

vietnamese leaders said they falsified 
the date of ho chi minhs death and changed portions of his will 
putting the leaders body on display in a glass mausoleum when his 
initial wish was to be cremated 
communist party chief nguyen van linh issued a communique 
admitting to a number of problems regarding president ho chi 
minhs testament and the day on which he died the official radio 
hanoi said thursday a transcript of the broadcast was seen in 
bangkok friday 
hos last testament recently was published in full for the first 
time it was made public after his death in 1969 but owing to the 
historical circumstances at the time some facts were not 
publicized linhs communique said 
one of these was the section that requested he be cremated and 
his ashes contained in three earthen pots for the north the central 
and southern parts of the country it said 
instead authorities asked ho permission to change that section 
of the will and when he died the body was embalmed and placed in a 
glass coffin publicly displayed in a sovietstyle mausoleum in 
hanoi the communique said 
the communique said the party leadership found it necessary to 
preserve the uncles remains for a long time so that compatriots 
nationwide particularly the southern compatriots and international 
friends might have a chance to visit the uncle 
this reflected the partys profound sentiments towards the 
uncle it said 
it was because of this that we asked the uncle for permission 
to revise this point in a way at variance with what he had 
instructed it said 
the communique did not say when ho was asked permission to change 
the portion of the will regarding his cremation or whether other 
changes also were made with his permission 
the communique said the party also decided to announce that ho 
had died a day later than he did 
ho died on sept 2 but this was vietnams national day and the 
party leadership changed the date to prevent the date of uncle 
hos death from coinciding with a day of great national rejoicing 
the communique said 
it said that in the original version of the will authorities 
also changed a sentence on the war against the united states 
ho actually wrote that the antius war for national salvation 
may last for a few years but the officially announced version 
read the antius resistance is likely to drag on the 
communique said 
the communique said some paragraphs on national reconstruction 
once the communist victory was won also were omitted 
it said this was because when uncle ho passed away the 
antius war of resistance for national salvation was still 
difficult and fierce and we had not yet won a final victory 
therefore it was inappropriate to make public the paragraphs

secretary of state james a baker iii and 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze are expected to sign 
an agreement at their meeting sept 2223 expanding superpower 
cooperation on human rights administration sources say 
the memorandum of understanding now being drafted by federal 
agencies will also outline ussoviet cooperation on new topics 
such as rule of law occupational safety and womens issues said 
bush administration officials who spoke on condition that they not 
be further identified 
the agreement the result of a soviet request is viewed by the 
administration as a step toward president bushs stated goal of 
integrating the soviet union more deeply into the world community 
the officials said 
the agenda for the bakershevardnaze meeting to be held in grand 
teton national park in wyoming also includes more customary 
ussoviet issues such as arms control and regional conflicts in 
africa afghanistan cambodia and central america said state 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
the discussion is also expected to touch on new areas of 
ussoviet cooperation such as the fight against terrorism and 
drug trafficking as well as the functioning of the united nations 
and other international organizations the sources said 
the meeting is designed to lay the groundwork for a summit 
between president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev no 
date has been set for a summit and it was not clear whether one 
would be held by years end 
a soviet delegation is due in washington during the week of sept 
11 to work on the human rights agreement which would involve 
cooperation by us agencies not usually involved in superpower 
relations such as the justice department the occupational safety 
and health administration and the national institute of mental 
health 
the wider dialogue stems from a request shevardnadze made of 
baker in paris on july 28 to expand ussoviet discussion on human 
rights deputy foreign minister anatoly adamshin conducted 
preliminary discussions on the expanded dialogue during a visit to 
washington early last month said the officials 
there is no memorandum yet because individual offices are still 
working on their sections said one state department source 
the expanded cooperation requested by the shevardnadze would 
include visits to the united states by soviet miners to learn about 
american safety techniques said a second state department official 
also speaking on condition of anonymity safety was an issue in 
strikes by 500000 soviet miners in july 
the soviets also want to expand cooperation on environmental 
issues widening dialogue that began during the detente era the 
sources said 
us officials continue to criticize some soviet human rights 
policies although the tone has changed with gorbachevs reforms 
which among other things have increased levels of jewish emigration 
long a point of contention 
bush has said that if the kremlin changes its emigration policies 
he may waive portions of a 1974 law that bars trade concessions to 
the soviet union as long as jews are restricted from leaving that 
country the law was named after the late sen henry jackson 
dwash and former rep charles vanik dohio 
last friday the national conference on soviet jewry which 
monitors emigration from the soviet union reported that more jews 
left that country in august than in any month since 1968 6756 jews 
last month surpassing the previous high of 4746 in october 1979 
since january 33444 jews have been allowed to leave the soviet 
union and the total for 1989 could surpass the previous high of 
51320 set in the 1979 according to officials of the national 
conference on soviet jewry 
last year 18965 jews emigrated from the soviet up sharply from 
the 1987 figure of 8155 and the 1986 figure of 914 the conference 
reported

the state has sent environmental 
officers to the tip of cape cod this weekend in an effort to protect 
a 5monthold right whale that apparently was hit by boats at least 
twice while feeding with its mother 
this little devil and his mother seem to be bent on hanging 
around the race point area where there is great congestion said 
phil coates director of the division of marine fisheries 
not only are these people getting too close but theyre 
apparently banging into the darned thing he added 
the labor day weekend is one of the busiest of the summer on cape 
cod and good weather means that boaters are out in force officials 
believe the whale will be all right if it gets through monday 
right whales are an endangered species with about 300 in the 
north atlantic waters including about eight calves like this one 
born this year right whales have enormous heads and swim slowly 
the injured whale has been swimming about 400 yards off the 
provincetown beach in recent weeks possibly because its mother 
feels protected there according to charles mayo of the research 
center for coastal studies 
mayo said the baby whale was hit by a boat two weeks ago and has 
shown fresh wounds recently he said the small craft of fishermen 
also disturb the whale 
we definitely will be out there tomorrow sunday and monday 
said john tulik a sergeant on the state enviromental patrol 
were just telling people about it 
theyre not trying to damage the whale intentionally but the 
whales are right in where the boats parallel the shore to go

hundreds of east germans poured into 
refugee camps on saturday joining thousands of others waiting for 
an unprecedented mass exodus of east bloc citizens to the west 
east germans continued to fill up emergency camps here and west 
german and red cross officials said 500 were expected by the end of 
the day 
more than 3000 east germans already were inside the camps in and 
near budapest awaiting passage to west germany under an arrangement 
between bonn and communist hungary 
authorities will not say when the transfer is to take place 
although it is believed it will begin within days it is the first 
time a warsaw pact nation and a nato country have worked together to 
move huge masses of people from another warsaw pact nation 
hungarian red cross official andras kovacs in charge of the 
csilleberc refugee camp in budapest said saturday that six buses 
carrying about 250 people had departed for zanka a new camp opened 
90 miles to the southwest to house the overflow from the budapest 
camp 
for weeks thousands of east germans have crowded emergency 
quarters in hungary refusing to leave unless guaranteed safe 
passage to the west 
an estimated 6000 already have fled to west germany through 
austria with the exodus starting shortly after hungary began 
removing barbed wire and other barriers from its westernmost border 
in may 
west germany grants east german refugees automatic citizenship 
and assistance in starting a new life 
hungary has been a traditional vacation spot for east germans who 
have difficulty getting permission for legal travel to the west from 
their hardline communist government but can come to this liberal 
soviet bloc country relatively easily 
an estimated 200000 east germans are now in hungary hungarian 
premier miklos nemeth has estimated that up to 20000 want to go to 
west germany 
the red cross in budapest has declined comment on reports that 
mass transport of the refugees will begin from zanka which has its 
own railway station 
in bavaria west germanys main border state with austria 
hundreds of red cross personnel began work saturday on a fifth 
tent city for the expected influx of east germans 
a west german spokesman said work was on schedule with all five 
tent communities expected to be standing by late sunday with a 
capacity of 5000 austrian railway officials meanwhile kept up to 
50 train cars ready for quick movement to border points with hungary 
when the transport starts 
austrian border officials said about 50 more east germans fled 
illegally from hungary overnight 
under a bilateral agreement hungary is obliged to send east 
germans trying to flee to the west back to their communist homeland 
the standoff has led to tension between the two soviet bloc nations 
the plight of the east germans waiting to go west has confronted 
hungary with a difficult choice between loyalty to its warsaw pact 
allies and a new commitment to western views on human rights 
hungarys dilemma has prompted leftists in west germany and 
austria to demand new aid for budapest and new rights for hungarians 
to work in western europe to ensure that budapests reforms do not 
falter 
karsten voigt a member of the west german opposition denied 
bonn would reward hungary which is struggling with a 17 
billion foreign debt for allowing the east germans out 
officials have said they do not know when the transport will 
begin but zanka camp leader gyoergy fekete was overheard by western 
reporters to tell east germans in tents and trailers outside zanka 
to report regularly until tuesday so as not to miss news of a 
possible departure 
as at the other camps zanka officials refused to allow reporters 
entry several buses arrived each hour to the main entry point 
where the passengers most of them young and appearing tired 
disappeared behind the iron gate 
other wouldbe refugees came in their own cars apparently after 
cutting short holidays 
one of the east germans said he turned 21 while arriving friday 
from czechoslovakia which separates hungary from east germany 
i drank a bottle of champagne all by myself in the train to 
celebrate he said 
an east german at a budapest camp on the grounds of a roman 
catholic church said some fellow camp members were getting 
increasingly nervous as they awaited news of their departure 
i spend a lot of my time trying to calm some of the more 
desperate ones said the man the east german who gave his 
hometown as dresden said many of those on the church grounds had 
been there for three weeks or more 
he spoke against a backdrop of tents and trailers on the other 
side of the fence several trees were festooned with laundry lines 
and children played noisily on a set of swings

japan may develop its own computer software for the 
fsx fighter jet if the united states refuses to supply it a defense 
agency official said saturday 
however the official speaking on condition of anonymity denied 
a report in the asahi shimbun newspaper that the united states 
already has refused to provide the software

fighter 
japan and the united states signed an agreement in november for 
joint development of the fsx the next generation of fighter jet 
the japanese originally planned to develop the plane on their

congress facing a crowded foreign policy 
agenda marked by both crisis and opportunity apparently is eager to 
help poland with significantly more aid than proposed by president 
bush 
but although democratic and republican leaders agree on the need 
to help polands new government demonstrate it can outperform the 
communist regime it replaced there is little sense of how much 
additional money can be squeezed out of an already overburdened 
budget 
overall there is growing unease on capitol hill that the means 
available do not match the magnitude of the global problems waiting 
to be addressed 
these include how to deal with the challenge to the authority of 
the government of colombia by narcotics racketeers how best to wage 
the war on drugs how to manage an era of warmer relations with the 
soviet union and how to deal with china in the aura of anger caused 
by the crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators 
house and senate members are ending their summer recess and 
streaming back to capitol hill many fresh from visits to nations 
whose problems congress will soon seek to address 
one of the trips claimed the life of rep mickey leland dtexas 
whose airplane crashed into a mountainside en route to a refugee 
camp in ethiopia many of lelands colleagues vow to carry on his 
efforts to combat world hunger 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas returned from a visit 
with polands new leaders campaigning for increased aid and senate 
majority leader george mitchell of maine an apparent ally says 
those members with whom i have talked believe we should go beyond 
the 100 million the president proposed 
i think the events occurring in poland could be historic in 
nature and we ought to be doing everything we can to encourage the 
conversion of that government from communist to non communist 
mitchell said 
the primary thing is food dole said they want to fill the 
shelves they want to show change people expect things to get 
better we need to act quickly 
poland is plagued with serious consumer shortages and there are 
long lines for the few goods available for sale 
but dole said there are only vague ideas of how to find the 
money to pay for new assistance and mitchell said the final 
dimensions of an aid package will not emerge for some time 
sen richard lugar rind a former chairman of the senate 
foreign relations committee says private capital not government 
aid is likely to prove the answer as poland struggles to build a 
noncommunist future 
lugar visited nine latin american nations in 14 days of the 
summer recess focusing on the problems of narcotics and huge 
foreign debts 
congress is likely to be highly supportive of us efforts to 
help colombia battle armed narcotics traffickers who recently took 
responsibility for murdering a leading presidential candidate 
it has focused the worlds attention on how fragile a 
government can be lugar said 
support also is strong for efforts to eradicate coca crops from 
which the cocaine is produced in such countries as colombia 
bolivia and peru 
but lugar said the lure of enormous profits is so great that he 
does not believe eradication and crop substitution will lead to 
anything but the removal of coca production to other fields in other 
countries 
it boggles the imagination as to how you control this lugar 
said 
the war against drugs will be won only through a determined 
campaign to reduce consumption lugar said 
one of his colleagues sen joseph biden ddel is taking the 
other tack pressing for adoption of a debt for drugs exchange 
in which latin american nations guarantee the destruction of 
narcotics crops in return for relief from some of the burden of 
their large external debt 
calls on the united states to intervene to destroy narcotics 
crops with us personnel are expected but lugar and others advised 
extreme caution 
attempts to use us forces to destroy coca crops in peru lugar 
said might well inject those forces into an internal civil war with 
perus shining path guerillas who are centered in narcotics 
producing regions 
congress is also closely following strategic arms control talks 
with the soviet union in geneva and negotiations on reducing 
conventional arms in europe in vienna 
most congressional observers feel that agreement on sharply 
reducing nuclear weapons will not come quickly but that 
conventional reductions are on a faster track 
there is movement meanwhile to suspend the trade restrictions 
imposed by the socalled jacksonvanik amendment as the soviet union 
eases emigration controls on jews and other minority groups it 
hasnt jelled yet lugar says 
the house is to vote this week on legislation granting hungary 
mostfavored nation trade status in recognition of steps taken to 
liberalize the hungarian economy 
trade issues especially with japan remain on the 
congressional front burner as do efforts to free us hostages in 
lebanon 
on the horizon are the opening of negotiations on military base 
rights with the philippines lugar noted that the government of 
singapore has asked that its territory be considered for us bases 
if the usphilippine talks collapse 
he also predicted a lively discussion on the role of the us 
military presence in asia especially in south korea where us 
forces have been stationed since the end of the korean war in the 
1950s 
in the senate a number of bushs appointments to key embassies 
remain under fire by democrats who complain the nominees have no 
visible qualifications other than large contributions to republican 
campaigns 
the nomination of donald gregg who served as bushs vice 
presidential foreign policy adviser remains in doubt because of 
allegations he misled the senate foreign relations committee about 
his alleged links to the irancontra affair 
the rest of the menu includes continued us aid to 
anticommunist rebels in afghanistan the resolution of conflict 
involving angola and namibia continuing protests against apartheid 
rule in south africa and the prospects for free elections in the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza

the government said saturday it will reopen 
turkeys only rail link to europe nine days after it was closed to 
slow a tide of ethnic turks seeking refuge in their native land 
foreign ministry spokesman murat sungar said the decision would 
go into effect sunday 
the single train that travels daily between munich and istanbul 
goes through austria yugoslavia and bulgaria it is turkeys only 
outlet to those countries by rail 
bulgaria had been sending hundreds of ethnic turks daily on the 
train since may turkey barred the entry of the train on aug 25 
turkey also began requiring visas for ethnic turks coming from 
bulgaria on aug 22 about 310000 have flooded into turkey in the 
past three months 
sungar said the decision to reopen the rail link was taken on the 
assumption that bulgaria would only send those ethnic turks with 
proper visas aboard the train 
the immigrants say they are fleeing from a harsh assimilation 
campaign in bulgaria which among other things has included forced 
change of their moslem names to slavic ones 
a group of 350 ethnic turks arrived in this country with visas 
during the past 10 days

christian leader michel aoun said saturday 
that the united states has done nothing to end the fighting in 
lebanon and secretly supports his syrian foes 
as the ustrained general spoke in a bunker beneath the 
shattered presidential palace syrian and christian shells crashed 
into houses shops and businesses in the beirut area killing two 
people and wounding 18 
americas declared policy is in support of lebanons 
sovereignty and independence but in practice america supports 
syrias military presence in lebanon aoun said at a news 
conference in his bunker east of beirut 
this is a plot american politicians support syria here and 
syria does not recognize lebanons sovereignty aoun claims the 
40000 syrian troops in lebanon are an occupation force and he has 
vowed to drive them out 
the syrians intervened in 1976 under an arab league mandate to 
quell the civil war that broke out 18 months earlier but aoun 
charges they violated that mandate by openly siding with the moslems 
the united states has repeatedly appealed for a ceasefire in 
lebanon often calling on syria to cooperate with peace efforts 
but washington has not helped arm aoun or denounce syrias latest 
siege on the christian heartland the united states also has not 
sent envoys to lebanon to spur peace efforts as france and the 
soviet union have done 
police said the casualties saturday raised the toll since 
fighting broke out march 8 to at least 825 killed and 2438 wounded 
eighteen people were killed and more than 100 wounded in 24 hours 
of nonstop shelling that eased at midnight friday leaving 
buildings in flames and streets choked with rubble 
aoun accused the united states of giving syria one chance after 
the other to strike at lebanon militarily without even denouncing 
any crime being committed in lebanon 
the 54yearold maronite catholic general said washingtons 
policy in lebanon is to scare off the lebanese with the objective 
of putting them under syrias control to enable america to work out 
a settlement to the middle east crisis at lebanons expense 
he said the soviet union was exerting sincere efforts for peace 
in lebanon and the middle east but charged that the united states 
does not accept soviet involvement in the mediterranean 
he declared syria has been besieging our coast for six months 
and preventing fuel supplies from reaching us why do the americans 
permit this 
the fighting flared again before dawn after a fourhour lull 
police said syrian artillery shelled the 28mile stretch of 
mediterranean coastline controlled by aouns forces to maintain the 
blockade of christian ports syrian troops and their moslem militia 
allies ring the landward sides of the 310squaremile christian 
enclave north of beirut 
devastating shelling by both sides has driven all but an 
estimated 150000 of beiruts 15 million population to flee the 
city for refuge in south lebanon the bekaa valley in the east and 
mountain resorts northeast of beirut 
smoke billowed from the wooded hills southeast of beirut where 
syrian artillery batteries were hammered by aouns gunners in 
predawn battles 
a police spokesman who cannot be named under standing 
regulations said the druse moslem suburb of shweifat southeast of 
beirut took the brunt of the christians artillery barrage during 
the night 
amin jirdi a shweifat native said the area was literally 
plowed by shellfire from christians that shattered houses shops 
and businesses 
several fires blazed out of control through the night we hid 
in a basement until early this morning when the intensity of the 
shelling decreased and we managed to get out jirdi said 
he was interviewed at the key highway junction at khalde three 
miles south of shweifat as he drove his wife and two daughters 
south in the family sedan loaded with mattresses blankets and 
clothes

jim bakkers wife blamed his emotional 
collapse on a reaction to medication and a former ptl official said 
theres no way bakker faked the breakdown but a federal 
prosecutor called it awfully suspect 
whatever the truth the future of the tv evangelists fraud and 
conspiracy trial is in doubt while he undergoes evaluation at a 
psychiatric hospital at the federal correctional institution at 
butner 
the judge sent bakker sobbing disheveled and shackled in arm 
and leg chains to butner on thursday after his psychiatrist 
testified he had been hallucinating curled in a fetal position and 
hiding his head under a couch in his lawyers office 
the collapse came in the fourth day of bakkers trial 
prosecutors allege bakker used nearly 4 million in ministry funds 
to finance a lavish lifestyle if convicted of all 24 charges 
against him bakker would face 120 years in prison and more than 5 
million in fines 
bakkers lawyers say he was not competent to continue with the 
trial a court observer said that even if bakker is deemed competent 
after the evaluation us district judge robert potter will have 
little choice but to declare a mistrial if the psychiatric 
evaluation takes too long 
i think the trial will resume at some point said mike 
scofield a former federal prosecutor i dont know if it will be 
this jury because there could be a long continuance 
the problem then will be the difficulty of picking another 
jury scofield said defense lawyers tried unsuccessfully for 
months to move the trial out of charlotte because of pretrial 
publicity 
dr sally johnson butners chief of psychiatric services said 
evaluations of patients like bakker typically take 30 days but can 
take 45 days or longer scofield says the law bars holding bakker 
more than four months 
tammy faye bakker said friday night her husband had suffered an 
allergic reaction to an antidepressant medication 
there is no reason at all for jim to be in prison mrs 
bakker said after meeting with her husband for six hours he just 
literally had more medication than he could handle i think judge 
potter is being very unfair bakkers psychiatrist dr basil 
jackson had told potter he prescribed the sedative xanax for bakker 
when the evangelist hallucinated wednesday after a witness fainted 
however the charlotte observer on saturday quoted jackson as 
saying the amount of medication bakker had been given was 
infinitesimal because i recognized his concern about overreaction 
jackson had tried to persuade the judge to allow bakker to enter 
a private hospital rather than the prison facility 
mrs bakker a gospel singer who has costarred with bakker on 
their talkshow style religious tv programs denied that bakker 
faked his attack 
if you had seen mr bakker you would know he doesnt perform 
hes just jim not a performer she said 
don hardister former security chief at the multimilliondollar 
ptl television ministry said the collapse was not bakkers first 
hardister recalled that bakker suffered an emotional breakdown 
after his resignation from ptl in march 1987 bakker called his 
bodyguard to his palm springs calif home at 3 am and was 
convinced jerry falwell had stolen the ministry from him falwell 
temporarily ran the ministry after bakker left 
he was slumped over looking real bad hardister recalled 
he just kept saying he stole it he stole it hardister said 
he stayed up with bakker for three nights keeping razors and knives 
away from him 
i think he will recover but i dont think it will be quick 
hardister said asked if he thought bakker was faking hardister 
replied no way 
bakker in his 1976 autobiography wrote about another breakdown 
he said he suffered in 1969 when he was part of pat robertsons tv 
ministry 
problems loomed completely out of proportion to their actual 
size bakker wrote it seemed as if whatever little control i 
had over myself might snap any minute and id be floating in an 
emotional stream unable to return what if that happened it seemed 
like an endless cycle that i was helpless to stop 
assistant us attorney jerry miller was skeptical when bakkers 
psychiatrist testified that bakker could not continue the trial 
on wednesday defense lawyer george t davis had called bakker to 
the witness stand to pray for prosecution witness steve nelson a 
former ptl vice president who collapsed after giving incriminating 
evidence about his boss 
on thursday miller told potter its hard to interpret it in 
any other way than mr davis has once again this time he didnt 
summon his client up to pray this time he summons a psychiatrist 
up to say that his client cant go forward with the defense and 
its awfully suspect 
potter suspended the trial at least until wednesday telling the 
jury nothing about bakkers condition

federal officials and aviation experts are 
trying to discourage child pilots from trying recordbreaking jaunts 
like an 11yearolds globetrotting trip this summer 
it leaves the public with the impression that there are a bunch 
of kids flying around out there and thats simply not the case 
gabe bruno general manager of the federal aviation administrations 
general aviation operations branch said friday 
tony aliengena of san juan capistrano accompanied by his 
licensed pilot father gary became the youngest person to pilot a 
plane around the world with his 22000mile jaunt from june 5 
through july 22 the friendship flight included numerous stops 
in the soviet union 
in april 1988 when he was 9 tony claimed a record as the 
youngest person to fly across the united states breaking the record 
set the previous year by 10yearold christopher lee marshall of 
oceano calif 
in july 1988 christopher by then 11 was back in the books 
claiming the record as the youngest person to fly the atlantic 
bruno said federal laws cannot ban such flights as long as a 
licensed pilot is aboard and takes responsibility 
i wouldnt say that theres a safety issue here he said 
its an image type of thing 
the state senate unanimously passed a resolution rewarding tony 
for his courage in piloting the singleengine cessna but the faa 
and private pilots withheld praise 
a seattle wash pilot complained to louis c cusimano the 
faas acting general aviation manager and cusimano wrote back we 
are concerned that these recent flights by youngsters may have 
served to reduce public confidence in the safety of the aviation 
system 
therefore we will be actively working with general aviation 
organizations and flight instructors to discourage such actions in 
the future cusimano wrote in june in a letter the los angeles 
times obtained under the freedom of information act 
a spokesman for the worlds largest pilots group said youngsters 
should learn about flying through more legitimate channels like the 
boy scouts and the aviation explorer program 
these flights by young people tend to trivialize the flight 
instruction process said frank white spokesman for the 
295000member aircraft owners and pilots association 
the aliengenas were vacationing in utah during the weekend and 
could not be reached for comment 
the faa still is investigating the july 18 crash of the 
aliengenas plane in golovin alaska the crash occurred during a 
fishing trip while father and son were taking a break from the 
roundtheworld voyage tony was on board but his father was at the 
controls 
gary aliengena told faa investigators that he had mistaken a 
taxiway for the runway and did not have enough room or speed to 
become airborne the cessna was damaged but no one seriously 
injured the trip continued in a borrowed plane the faa is 
considering disciplinary action against the elder aliengena for 
having too heavy a passenger load at the time

the bombing saturday of the newspaper el 
espectador demonstrated once again the risks colombian journalists 
face when reporting on the countrys cocaine industry 
guillermo cano the former editor of el espectador heads the 
list of journalists in colombia who have died in the fight against 
drug traffickers 
he was assassinated dec 17 1986 while leaving the newspaper 
building the same one heavily damaged by saturdays bomb 
authorities charged pablo escobar the most powerful chief of the 
medellin cocaine cartel with ordering and planning the slaying 
escobar now in hiding leads the list of 12 socalled 
extraditables people wanted on drugrelated charges in the 
united states 
cano wrote fiercely and consistently against the drug 
traffickers and the paper has continued the campaign since his 
killing 
in september 1986 assassins killed veteran antidrug newsman 
raul echavarria of the newspaper occidente in cali another large 
cocaineproducing city no one has yet been convicted of the crime 
juan gomez now mayor of medellin the worlds no 1 cocaine 
center fought off a kidnap attempt in 1987 when he was the editor 
of the el colombiano newspaper there the extraditables claimed 
responsibility 
gomez now is the sole leading colombian political figure who 
proposes negotiating with the drug cartels a policy adamantly 
opposed by president virgilio barco and the defense minister gen 
oscar botero 
the frontrunning candidate for president in colombian elections 
set for next may luis carlos galan also campaigned on an antidrug 
cartel platform drug gangs killed him on aug 18 
journalist andres pastrana left the directorship of an 
independently produced colombian network tv news program to run for 
mayor of bogota the capital the extraditables kidnapped him in 
january 1988 but police rescued him a week later and he won the 
election 
in such a dangerous climate many colombian journalists have 
opted for selfexile 
they include daniel samper one of the most popular columnists of 
el tiempo of bogota the nations largest paper and mauricio gomez 
the director of the nationally syndicated 24 hours nightly tv 
news program both survived assassination attempts by drug gangs 
news executives and controversial newsmen remaining in colombia 
have adopted elaborate personal security measures establishing 
private intelligence networks contracting bodyguards and accepting 
police protection of their homes 
the police recently found and deactivated bombs at the medellin 
offices of caracol and rcn colombias two biggest private radio 
networks 
the extraditables specifically cite journalists among their 
enemies in their proclaimed total and absolute war against 
colombians who oppose them 
still owners of 25 colombian newspapers told barco on thursday 
they give full backing to recently decreed emergency measures 
seeking to confiscate colombian drug traffickers fortunes and send 
the extraditables to the united states

slain conservationist george 
adamson was buried saturday at this remote game reserve where he and 
his wife born free author joy adamson gained fame for their 
work with lions 
the 83yearold former game warden was killed by armed bandits on 
aug 20 nine years after his wife was slain in a wage dispute with 
a servant 
about 60 of adamsons friends and admirers including 
conservationists diplomats and actors traveled to the brief 
service in small planes to his simple scrubland camp about 240 miles 
east of nairobi 
an anglican priest led the burial procession to the gravesite a 
sandy hillside of acacia trees and bush above the tana river 
adamsons brother terence is also buried there 
adrian house chairman of the elsa wild animal appeal and the 
adamsons publisher eulogized adamson as a man who when he feared 
death looked it in the face and didnt flinch 
elsa is the name of the lion featured in born free the 
adamsons taught dozens of lions orphaned or born in captivity to 
survive in the wild 
adamson and two assistants died in a spray of gunfire as they 
went to the rescue of another assistant and a house guest who had 
been attacked by gunmen near the camp 
the gunmen apparently robbers turned their fire on adamson when 
he tried to run them over in his land rover 
in his eulogy house challenged the mourners to carry on 
adamsons work 
he referred to a passage in adamsons autobiography my pride 
and joy in which adamson asks who will raise their voices 
when mine is carried away in the wind to plead koras case 
it is up to us all of us to share in efforts to answer 
georges cry said house 
last week a friend of adamson 71yearold douglas collins 
moved to kora with an assistant to oversee the park which is home 
to about 16 lions adamson released there 
richard leakey kenyas wildlife director accompanied adamsons 
body in an air force helicopter from nairobi to kora national park 
in brief comments before adamsons burial he pledged kenyas 
commitment to wiping out the violence that has claimed the life of 
adamson and killed three tourists in similar attacks since june 
it will come to an end and we will have peace in our parks 
he said 
after a 12man honor guard from the department of wildlife fired 
three volleys into the air and game rangers played a trumpet 
rendition of the last post adamsons simple wooden coffin was 
lowered into the ground next to his brothers grave 
among those at the service were sir john johnson britains high 
commissioner in kenya and bill travers and virginia mckenna a 
british couple who played the adamsons in a movie version of born

blocky is not going to threaten nintendos 
hold on the youth of america but a couple of researchers from the 
university of texas are hoping the videogame creature helps protect 
young people from aids 
blocky is the hero in blockaids a video game youngsters 
can play at the houston museum of medical science players score 
points by correctly answering questions about acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome 
the game also allows players to look up aids information in the 
computer in the form of hints that help them answer the 
multiplechoice questions correctly a correct answer gleaned from 
hints brings the youngster some points but fewer than a correct 
answer gotten right off the bat 
we decided on a game as opposed to other more traditional 
methods of teaching because we felt adolescents would be more 
receptive to a game said craig johnson associate professor of 
biomedical communications at the university of texas health science 
center at houston 
how many teenagers are actually going to read the surgeon 
generals reports on aids 
johnson and bill fetter a fellow researcher and assistant 
professor came up with the game idea a kind of video tictactoe 
when a player gives a correct answer blocky zaps an evil aids 
virus who previously rested in the square completion of a row sends 
the player to a new screen and the opportunity to score more points 
fetter said the tictactoe concept was selected because kids 
already know how to play the game 
if we created an entirely new design we would spend more time 
teaching them how to play the game than teaching them about aids 
fetter said 
it was apparent there is a strong need for aids education 
johnson said an entire generation could be at risk there was a 
need to put this into a format that would grab and hold the 
attention of adolescents we wanted to make a contribution 
on their own time and at their own expense fetter and johnson 
and two school graduates assembled the game during evenings and on 
weekends 
our perception is its the first game of its kind in aids 
education and the first to be based on the surgeon generals report 
on aids fetter said 
the game has been part of a handson display at the museum since 
march the computer program which also asks general demographic 
data like age race and sex is set up to record the answers of 
people who play it so researchers can analyze the data and identify 
those facets of the disease most misunderstood 
at this point we dont have a good handle on the impact 
johnson said weve just started collecting the data 
in coming up with the design a block for the hero made sense 
because we were looking at blocking aids fetter said they also 
gave him boxing gloves and running shoes 
the villain aids virus with bloodshot eyes and an evil toothy 
grimace is not unlike a microscopic representation of the real aids 
virus he said 
the 250 questions are pulled from the surgeon generals report on 
aids johnson an educational psychologist said repeating some of 
the questions promotes retention 
typical of questions is whether aids is on the increase or how 
does one contract aids or is it possible to get aids by merely 
being in a tent with an aids carrier it is not 
one of the issues were dealing with is that we felt there are 
a lot of myths about aids johnson said 
although the museum game powered by an ibm computer is a 
oneofakind now he said it has the potential for use in school 
computers it also is designed so new information about aids can be 
inserted easily 
this is in a museum but displays like this could be in lots of 
other plays like shopping malls convenience stores military bases 
and school cafeterias johnson said they need to be put in 
places where people need the help most

riot police using whips and clubs 
attacked antiapartheid protesters who tried to march to parliament 
on saturday arresting 450 people and injuring dozens 
the march was planned as part of a nationwide campaign to defy 
apartheid laws the movement has intensified in the days leading up 
to wednesdays parliamentary elections which exclude the black 
majority 
in one dramatic incident a young white activist climbed atop a 
mobile water cannon that was spraying purpledyed water at the 
protesters he turned the hose away so that it sprayed an office 
building housing offices of the ruling national party scuffled with 
a policeman then ran into the crowd 
police were heard giving orders that anyone seen with purple dye 
on their clothes should be detained 
among the estimated 450 protesters arrested was the rev allan 
boesak a prominent mixedrace activist who is president of the 
world alliance of reformed churches police said 52 journalists 
many of them foreign reporters also were arrested when police 
invoked emergency regulations barring onscene coverage of unrest 
the protesters and 50 of the journalists were released several 
hours later it was not clear if the protesters would be charged 
later with joining an illegal gathering 
two crewmen for the londonbased visnews television network were 
told they would be held and charged 
dozens were reported injured after the police action more than 
1500 protesters some injured and others soaked in purple dye 
crowded into st georges cathedral for a service led by anglican 
archbishop desmond tutu 
all moral right is on your side tutu told the multiracial 
throng we have committed ourselves to this struggle until freedom 
is won 
near the end of the service tutu asked the crowd to repeat after 
him we shall be free all of us together black and white in a 
free south africa 
the south african council of churches to which tutu and boesak 
are affiliated said in a statement that the government has 
declared an open war on the church and the people 
at least two large groups of protesters began separate marches in 
the city center before being dispersed one group of about 700 sat 
down in a street bordering a market square crowded with shoppers and 
sang a freedom song as the water cannon was brought in 
another group led by boesak set out from st georges cathedral 
before police moved in beating and whipping the marchers and using 
tear gas 
before his arrest boesak said many people who wanted to join the 
march had been stopped at police roadblocks while trying to leave 
outlying black and mixedrace townships 
journalists said police arrested several medics trying to treat 
injured protesters and at one point took away both medics and 
patients at a temporary clinic 
police raided at least one television news bureau arrested a cbs 
cameraman at his hotel room and detained journalists and 
photographers working for numerous south african and foreign news 
media including the associated press nbc reuters and the 
independent south african press association 
a tv crew from the statecontrolled south african broadcasting 
corp was also detained during the roundup 
 
a law and order ministry spokesman brig leon mellet said we 
cannot allow these propaganda efforts by the mass democratic 
movement organizer of the defiance campaign to tarnish south 
africas image abroad where a destructive view is being created by 
totally slanted reports emanating from south africa 
the march was one of the major events planned this weekend by the 
mass democratic movement police banned a rally scheduled for 
saturday in soweto and reported that white rightwing extremists had 
set off bombs near a whitesonly beach in durban where blacks and 
indians plan a mass sitin on sunday 
the defiance campaign began aug 2 and has intensified as the 
elections approach the black majority is excluded from parliament 
the citizen a progovernment newspaper quoted government 
sources saturday as saying that 17 leaders of the defiance campaign 
had been detained and 13 others were being sought including some 
who had gone into hiding 
in soweto the township of 25 million blacks scores of 
policemen and soldiers were stationed at jabulani stadium where 
saturdays peace rally had been scheduled to take place 
security forces also ringed a nearby roman catholic church which in 
the past has been used an alternative site for banned outdoor 
rallies 
in durban police said several small bombs exploded overnight in 
trash bins along the port citys beachfront pamphlets left by the 
bins denounced the plans by activists to stage a sitin sunday on 
the whitesonly section of the beach 
according to police headquarters more than 440 protesters were 
arrested across the country friday including tutu his wife leah 
and boesaks wife dorothy those three were among 36 people 
arrested and later released while marching to protest the beating of 
church workers during a demonstration earlier friday in cape town

warning signs failed to prevent cars from 
hitting moose on western maines moose highway so game wardens 
are now resorting to a rottenegg spray to keep the lumbering 
animals at bay 
a material known as putrascent has been used with limited success 
in canadian parks to keep deer and moose away from roadways said 
biologist ronald joseph of the maine warden service 
beginning this week the spray will be used at six locations 
along us route 201 between this western maine outpost and the 
canadian border 
the spray has an eggcompound base that is barely noticeable to 
humans although it repels moose 
wardens plan to check the six test sites for moose tracks before 
and after putrascent is used to see how effective the stinky 
repellent is said joseph officials say that moose are so big and 
heavy 500 to 700 pounds typically that a car hitting one can be 
a real danger for the cars occupants 
six signs erected along the highway to warn motorists of 
potential moose confrontations have had little effect joseph said 
part of the problem was that they were written in english and not in 
french the language of neighboring quebec another problem was 
theft two of the signs were stolen 
many motorists who have hit moose say they thought the moose 
warning signs were advertisements for the area according to marcia 
seavey administrator of the jackman health center moose river is 
between jackman and the quebec border and many local businesses are 
named in honor of the moose

the speaker is a powerful chicago 
democrat with blue eyes brown hair and the look of an irish 
republican army commando the guv is a republican nicknamed 
his tallness seeking a fourth term in office 
they become locked in a bizarre political chess game after two 
supporters of a littleknown political extremist stage upset 
victories in illinois 1986 democratic primary 
but the end of this tale lies not in recent history but in a 
murder mystery written by a sangamon state university political 
scientist who uses the news of the day and his knowledge of illinois 
politics to shape his paperback detective novels 
as i look at the paper every day im discarding or adding to my 
mental file things that i could conceivably use says david 
everson whose third novel rematch spins a tale of murder and 
political intrigue starting with the election upset 
though the book is labeled fiction readers familiar with 
illinois politics will find more than a few parallels with living 
breathing politicians 
illinois speaker of the house is michael madigan a chicago 
democrat with brown hair blue eyes and an irish ancestry gov 
james r thompson a 6foot6 republican is currently serving his 
fourth term 
two followers of political extremist lyndon larouche did win 
nominations for lieutenant governor and secretary of state in the 
1986 democratic primary they were quickly disowned by the party and 
lost the general election 
the central character in rematch and its predecessors 
recount and rebound is robert miles a private investigator 
who like his creator is a jogger with an inordinate fondness for 
soft drinks in rematch miles investigates the farright party 
which has landed two of its devotees on the democratic ticket 
though his novels often begin with reallife events everson 
said i never leave it at that what i do is take that premise 
and like with the characters exaggerate it always thinking of 
course that im writing a mystery 
a fourth book is to be published next year and a fifth is in the 
works but everson says hes not getting rich off his novels 
the best advice i heard given to beginning mystery writers was 
keep your daytime job he said

communist leaders praising the new 
solidarity prime minister as a realist said saturday they have 
been offered more than the two posts already promised them in 
tadeusz mazowieckis new government 
party chief mieczyslaw f rakowski and communist parliamentary 
leader marian orzechowski made the remarks after a morning meeting 
with mazowiecki who is expected to unveil his new government by 
sept 10 
today premier mazowiecki presented his government concept and 
it is in my opinion a realistic concept such as would be suitable 
for our party rakowski said in an interview on state television 
and radio 
the tone of his remarks appeared to indicate the communists are 
satisfied with their lot in the new government and will not raise 
any lastminute objections 
rakowski confirmed the party has been offered more than just the 
defense and internal affairs portfolios which control the army and 
the police he would not elaborate on what the posts were 
solidarity guaranteed the communists the first two posts prior to 
mazowieckis aug 24 election as the first noncommunist prime 
minister in the soviet bloc 
of mazowiecki rakowski said i think he is a realist he looks 
on the situation in poland realistically including the process of 
forming the government 
in addition to the communists mazowiecki must balance the 
interests of solidarity and his two minor coalition partners the 
united peasant and democratic parties 
there was no immediate statement about saturdays meeting from 
mazowieckis office 
the prime minister has been holding a nearconstant series of 
talks with various political leaders in the past week on forming the 
government but has generally avoided public comment on them 
in addition to what they have been promised the communists also 
want the ministry of foreign affairs also solidarity parliamentary 
leader bronislaw geremek has said the communists should have to take 
at least one economic ministry so they can share responsibility for 
unpopular economic reform 
if we receive the place in the country and social life 
appropriate to our political power and portfolios which confirm 
this place then the party will have to be active in cogoverning 
and extend support to steps to lift poland out of economic and 
political crisis rakowski said

the slaying of tobacco heiress margaret 
benson by her son should not keep his children from getting a share 
of her 10 million estate a state appeals court ruled 
the 2nd district court of appeal on friday upheld a circuit court 
decision guaranteeing an inheritance for the three young children of 
steven benson 
both courts rejected arguments that a state law barring killers 
from profiting from the wills of their victims could be applied to 
bensons children 
benson 38 murdered his mother and his adopted brother scott 
benson and disfigured his sister carol benson kendall in july 1985 
by exploding two pipe bombs in mrs bensons car in the driveway of 
the familys posh naples home 
mrs bensons will ordered her estate to be equally divided among 
her three children with scott benson dead and steven benson 
disqualified by state law as an heir his children claimed a half 
share of the estate 
mrs kendall challenged the will charging the children should be 
ineligible for the inheritance because of their fathers crimes 
an added twist to the case was the fact that scott benson was 
actually mrs kendalls illegitimate son he had been adopted by her 
mother mrs benson so he was mrs bensons biological grandson but 
legally her son and heir and aldo legally a brother of his 
biological mother 
attorney marjorie starnes who represented the three childrens 
interests in the estate was jubilant about the latest decision 
it means the children can now have an education and a secure 
future she said i am thrilled beyond description 
the appeals court said in a sevenpage opinion that state law 
restricts inheritances for those who intentionally kill another 
person but it is the surviving person who kills who is prohibited 
from benefiting from the act of killing 
attorney bert pena who handled mrs kendalls appeal said he 
was disappointed in the outcome he had not read the opinion and 
could not say if the case would be appealed again 
bensons children are living with their mother debra out of 
state because they need to be far away from the stigma of the 
case ms starnes said all three are kindergarten age or younger 
when federal taxes probate and other costs are deducted the 
three children stand to share about 2 million said estate executor 
carl westman the same amount would go to mrs kendall 
benson was sentenced to two life terms on two counts of 
firstdegree murder the prosecution charged he feared being cut out 
of his mothers will after she became outraged over his heavy 
spending on drugs and his personal life 
mrs benson was an heiress to the lancaster leaf tobacco co 
fortune of lancaster pa

and businesses throughout the southern republic said front member 
aiden amirbekov 
he said 1 million people turned out for saturdays rally nazim 
ragimov an independent journalist and activist said about 500000 
people attended 
amirbekov said the protesters are demanding that moscow lift its 
direct control over the nagornokarabakh region of azerbaijan the 
region has been the site of clashes between ethnic armenians and 
azerbaijanis 
activists in neighboring armenia want to annex the region where 
about 75 percent of the population is ethnic armenian 
the kremlin assumed direct control of the region in january in an 
attempt to end the dispute 
in the telephone interview amirbekov said saturdays protesters 
jammed lenin square in baku the azerbaijani capital carrying blue 
red and gold azerbaijan flags and signs demanding an end to 
interference by the kremlin in the republics affairs 
during the protest some people carried signs saying stop 
interfering in azerbaijans affairs karabakh is aggression 
against the sovereignty of azerbaijan amirbekov said 
the rally was peaceful and authorities made no effort to break 
it up he said 
officials at the republics interior and foreign affairs 
ministries reached by telephone declined comment on the rally 
telephones at the official azerinform news agency did not answer 
clashes between armenians and azerbaijanis have killed 100 people 
and forced hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homes 
the azerbaijan peoples front carried out a brief strike in late 
august and then called it off to await the governments reaction and 
plan a larger walkout 
the official tass news agency reported saturday that the 
azerbaijan government rejected as unconstitutional a declaration of 
independence by a council of armenian activists in nagornokarabakh 
in its report tass said the presidium of the azerbaijan supreme 
soviet the republics highest executive body met after armenian 
activists made their independence declaration in stepanakert 
nagornokarabakhs biggest city 
the news agency did not say when the armenians met 
the azerbaijan authorities found the move to be an infringement 
on government authority and an unconstitutional act aimed at 
trying to seize power tass said 
in another ethnic dispute the national supreme soviet made a 
move apparently designed to meet the demands of ethnic strikers in 
the moldavia republic 
tass said the national body formed a committee to study the 
political and social situation in moldavia strikers have demanded 
such a move 
the legislature of moldavia approved legislation thursday making 
moldavian the official language 
ethnic russians and other russianspeaking ethnic groups had 
demanded that russian be recognized as a second official language 
russianspeaking workers have been on strike at 200 enterprises to 
protest the language law 
a man who answered the telephone at strike headquarters in the 
moldavia city of tiraspol said the national commission was expected 
to visit on monday or tuesday and that strikers would decide after 
the visit whether to go back to work 
in the ukrainian republic a moscow activist reported that 
thousands of people gathered at rallies to demand stricter residency 
requirements in a local election law 
anatoly dotsenko said crowds of up to 50000 people gathered in 
the capital of kiev lvov and dneprodzerzhinsk and smaller crowds 
rallied elsewhere in protests organized by members of the congress 
of peoples deputies national parliament 
he said they were demanding that the law impose residency 
requirements and drop a section allowing national officials whose 
jurisdiction includes the ukraine to run for its legislature even 
if they live elsewhere 
the ethnic unrest and intense nationalism sweeping the soviet 
union has been resulted largely from the greater openness encouraged 
by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev

the new president met with government 
officials saturday to form a cabinet after calling for better us 
relations but he ruled out elections until washington lifts 
economic sanctions 
provisional president francisco rodriguez in a speech late 
friday before his first day in office said i am sure there are 
many important interests of the united states that can be compatible 
with the national interests of panama without undermining their 
prestige or sacrificing our dignity 
he said he would lead the country to a new democracy as soon as 
american aggression ceases and the funds arbitrarily withheld by the 
united states government are returned to the national treasury so 
that conditions of institutional normality can be reestablished 
he also called for a guarantee that elections can be held 
without foreign interference and manipulation 
the united states has frozen about 300 million in panamanian 
assets in an effort to topple gen manuel antonio noriega the power 
behind the civilian government washington has also been withholding 
panama canal fees since early 1988 and has imposed trade sanctions 
that include a ban on any payments including taxes to the 
panamanian government 
us embassy officials said friday the american government is 
compiling a list of companies and individuals associated with 
noriega for the purpose of blocking them from doing any business 
with any americans 
the us government considers rodriguez a puppet of noriega who 
commands panamas police and military the united states launched 
its antinoriega campaign after he was indicted by two federal grand 
juries in florida on drugtrafficking charges in february 1988 
noriega denies those charges 
rodriguez met saturday with leaders of the governments 
revolutionary democratic party and other officials to try to form a 
cabinet 
in his speech friday night rodriguez called on the us 
government to rid itself of the inventions and myths created by 
previous adminstrations 
if we look at our differences in terms of the real world and 
without capricious fantasies the many aspirations we share have 
made possible our long association including our alliance in two 
world wars he said 
he also asked for latin american solidarity urging south 
american governments to resist us pressures to condemn panama 
venezuela and costa rica have asked for noriegas resignation at 
least eight latin american countries have withdrawn ambassadors 
since the may 7 elections in a sign of displeasure with the 
governments decision to annul the vote 
international observers say the opposition won those elections in 
a landslide the government annulled them 
also saturday the european economic community in a statement 
issued in paris said the administration in panama is without 
institutional legitimacy it called for a solution that would 
allow the panamanian people to choose their own government 
rodriguez 50 was named president by the panamas council of 
state he was inaugurated in a brief ceremony friday when the 
previous administrations term expired

ocie mills and his son carey are strictly 
minor leaguers when it comes to polluting the nations waterways 
but they are near the top of the list in stubbornness and thats 
why they are in prison while much bigger polluters are not says a 
lawyer for the army corps of engineers 
most usually work it out short of trial by agreeing to pay 
fines and repairing environmental damage said mike rossiter in a 
recent telephone interview from the corps district headquarters in 
jacksonville they wanted their day in court and they got it 
ocie mills a 55yearold retired contractor and his 31yearold 
son are serving 21month sentences in the federal prison camp at 
saufley field a navy installation outside this florida panhandle 
city 
the father and son are two of only five federal prisoners serving 
time for polluting according to the us bureau of prisons they 
also are the first polluters convicted under a new law that takes 
sentencing discretion away from judges 
a jury last january convicted them of violating environmental law 
by dumping several truckloads of fill on wetlands in neighboring 
santa rosa county they also were convicted of illegally dredging a 
canal on the property two small lots on which they had planned to 
build a house for carey 
the millses insist the fill was dumped on uplands rather than 
wetlands that they were only cleaning out an existing drainage 
ditch rather than dredging that they didnt need corps permission 
to do either in any case they said they caused no pollution 
we believe there are some politics in it said the elder 
mills who ran unsuccessfully for the florida house last year and 
has frequently been at loggerheads with state and federal 
authorties but he admits he cannot prove various conspiracy 
theories he espouses to explain his plight 
he believes government is butting in where it doesnt belong by 
trying to tell people what they can and cannot do with their 
property 
their case has become a cause celebre among friends and the 
rightwing john birch society of which they are members their 
supporters have written numerous letters to the editors of 
newspapers and raised about 3000 for legal fees 
but rossiter makes no apology saying the millses failed to take 
advantage of opportunities to settle the case daring authorities to 
take them to court 
we consider all violations no matter how small violations 
he said they were blatant violators flagrant violators 
if officials looked the other way rossiter said neighbors would 
do the same thing eventually destroying wetlands that filter 
pollutants from the water and serve as a nursery for marine life 
the millses could be free men and they would have been allowed to 
build the house on stilts to protect the wetlands if only they had 
cooperated he said 
der has filed suit against the millses to force them to restore 
the property the pair have countersued accusing the agency of 
conspiracy a state judge has heard the case but not yet ruled 
the millses are appealing the criminal convictions

q eminence how will this matter of the carmelite nuns in 
auschwitz be resolved cardinal macharski has visited the pope in 
rome 
a oh we will resolve it we will resolve it with patience one 
needs to reflect a bit there are some jewish circles who have let 
themselves be carried away by nerves 
q in your opinion what irked jews the most in the words you 
spoke in czestochowa 
a perhaps there are various points they disliked that i said 
they have great influence on the mass media 
q and also that you said that their demands concerning the 
auschwitz carmelite convent are excessive 
a yes because its a scandal to expel the nuns from the 
convent what do we have to do put them in tents who do the nuns 
offend by praying next to the wall of the concentration camp the 
land they are on is land where catholics lets say christians were 
martyred i dont understand why they should be transferred do you 
our people dont understand the jews should understand that 
devoting oneself to a life of prayer near the place were christians 
were martyred doesnt offend their feelings 
q and instead you feel offended for having to move the 
carmelite convent 5oo meters 
a yes this is offensive because its an irrational gesture 
suppose i came to your house and said you have to move this 
wardrobe you rightly would respond stupid this is my property 
q but this accord on the transfer was signed in geneva two years 
ago by eminent members of the clergy 
a no by cardinal macharski and by a group of people who are not 
competent in the matter 
q what do you mean werent the cardinal of paris lustiger and 
of lyon decourtray and of brussels danneels there 
a i want this accord to be renegotiated it has to be done by 
competent people and not by just any cardinal who doesnt understand 
the things 
q so macharski did not understand 
a cardinal macharski didnt understand the situation of the 
people 
q so what do we do now 
a everything needs to be renegotiated with calm with dialogue 
the way i propose it has to be reexamined but by competent 
people and the poles can not be excluded 
q but was macharski who negotiated not a pole 
a macharski alone what do you mean he represents only the 
church of krakow the problem is much more vast 
q so you dont approve of what macharski did 
a i can believe that macharski signed because things were done a 
little too hastily 
q fine but then this ecumenical center next to the auschwitz 
camp will that be built or not 
a do you know how much this center costs someone has made this 
commitment but without money the center cannot be built for now 
there is no money 
q in fact there is only a sign on that land which reads here 
the center will be built isnt that a bit little two years after 
the geneva accord 
a our people who are going through a severe economic crisis 
cannot afford to build a center which costs at least 2 million 
q but the jews for example the american ones couldnt they 
help 
a yes i think so but first there is a need to reestablish a 
bit of calm 
q in order to reestablish this calm wouldnt you like to meet 
with the chief rabbi of warsaw who because of your talk in 
czestochowa has not attended the meeting for peace among religious 
leaders 
a oh i am still his friend 
q he says you are not 
a how is that then he has changed his mind with him we must 
face all the diffcult issues which have been neglected so far

lebanese jet that landed without permission at an airport and 
questioned three passengers who they feared could be terrorists 
an investigation showed three were not terrorists but aliens who 
failed to check in with immigration officials said henry brattlie 
deputy director of the us immigration and naturalization service 
office in philadelphia he said they showed blatant disregard of 
the countrys laws

terrorists or fine upstanding citizens brattlie said 
brattlie said the 20passenger gulf stream g3 jet with two 
pilots and at least six others on board left london and landed at 
harrisburg international airport last sunday after disregarding 
orders to travel to philadelphia for an immigration inspection

detained at 130 am saturday after the jet returned to harrisburg 
from burbank calif the other passengers on board when the plane 
first stopped at harrisburg were not on board when it returned and

whether to press charges 
we expect to file a criminal complaint in the near future

checking in with immigration officials can be jailed for up to five 
years if convicted anyone trying to bring an alien into the country 
without permission can be fined 1000 and sentenced to one year in

identify the corporation 
the manoukians were the three detained

published saturday that an agreement to move a convent away from 
auschwitz should be renegotiated because the cardinals who signed it 
didnt understand the issue 
glemp the roman catholic prelate of poland said that moving the 
carmelite convent would be a scandal and offensive because 
the nuns who live there are entitled to pray for christians who died 
at the nazis auschwitz death camp 
he criticized fellow polish cardinal franciszek macharski saying 
he acted too hastily and ignored polish public opinion when he and 
others signed a 1987 international accord to move the convent

end to hostility and hatred of judaism

barry morrison regional director of the antidefamation league of 
bnai brith said they would not attend the sept 25 service and 
reception 
glemps impromptu interview given to italian reporters in poland 
on friday appeared in several italian newspapers 
the reports contained the primates first published remarks on 
the matter since he stirred controversy last month by saying polish 
antisemitism would disappear if jews would abandon their 
antipolish sentiments 
he also offended many jews by suggesting jews helped spread 
communism and by saying some jews collaborated with nazis during 
world war ii or as businessmen neglected and detested poles 
in the remarks published saturday glemp said the auschwitz 
controversy could be settled he was quoted as saying oh we will 
resolve it with patience one needs to reflect a bit there are 
some jewish circles who have let themselves be carried away by 
nerves 
jewish groups say the convent and its christian religious symbols 
offend the memory of the 25 million jews who died there several 
jewish protesters recently entered to convent grounds to demand that 
the convent be moved 
glemp spoke to reporters from romes la repubblica and il 
messaggero newspapers milans il giornale and the catholic daily 
avvenire during a reception in warsaw glemp was among the religious 
leaders participating in joint prayers for peace on the 50th 
anniversary of the start of world war ii 
fridays ceremony was boycotted by polands rabbi menachem 
joszowicz because of the presence of the carmelite convent a few 
feet from the fence surrounding the death camp 
in an accord signed in geneva in 1987 by catholic and jewish 
leaders the nuns were supposed to have moved by feb 22 to an 
interfaith prayer center to be built several thousand yards away 
but the deadline passed without anything happening and the center 
has yet to be built 
on aug 19 macharski polishborn pope john paul iis successor 
as archbishop of krakow said he was suspending the accord because 
of aggressive demands and protests by jewish activists at the 
convent 
when a reporter said the accord was signed by top church 
officials glemp responded no by cardinal macharski and a group 
of men who are not competent in the matter la repubblica said 
in addition to macharski french cardinals jeanmarie lustiger 
and albert decourtray and belgian cardinal godfried danneels signed 
the 1987 agreement 
i want this accord to be renegotiated glemp was quoted as 
saying it has to be done by competent people and not by just any 
cardinal who doesnt understand the things 
its a scandal to expel the nuns from the convent he was 
quoted as saying what do we have to do put them in tents who do 
the nuns offend by praying next to the wall of the concentration 
camp 
our people dont understand the jews should understand that 
devoting oneself to a life of prayer near the place where christians 
were martyred doesnt offend their feelings 
asked if the ecumenical center would ever be built he said there 
was no money for it right now because of the nations economic 
crisis 
when asked if jews including americans could help pay for it 
he said yes i think so but first there is a need to 
reestablish a bit of calm 
theo klein former president of the representative council of 
jewish institutions of france and one of the signatories of the 1987 
agreement said in an interview on radio montecarlo 
if he wants to renegotiate the accord he will have to 
renegotiate with himself i dont see how any jewish authority would 
accept to renegotiate this accord with monsignor glemp

more than 250 people were met by curses and 
epithets as they marched through a white neighborhood saturday to 
protest the release of five alleged members of a white gang accused 
of killing a black teen 
as they did last weekend residents taunted the marchers during 
their 12block route through the brooklyn neighborhood of 
bensonhurst but police officers outnumbered demonstrators 
preventing any physical confrontations 
there were no arrests said police spokesman sgt peter berry 
the demonstration was sparked by the aug 23 shooting death of 
16yearold yusuf hawkins during an attack by a white gang in 
bensonhurst 
most of the residents taunts were directed at the rev al 
sharpton the controversial black activist who organized the march 
in response the marchers chanted yusuf yusuf and no justice 
no peace 
hawkins was killed in bensonhurst when he and three friends were 
confronted by about 30 whites carrying baseball bats and golf clubs 
who were looking for black friends of a white neighborhood girl 
police said 
hawkins who didnt know the girl and was in bensonhurst to look 
at a used car was shot twice in the chest seven people have been 
arrested including the alleged gunman joseph fama 
the slaying prompted demonstrations last weekend and a march 
with 7500 people on thursday led to a brawl near the brooklyn 
bridge which left 44 police officers injured 
the marchers saturday did not go through an italian festival 
being held in the neighborhood as sharpton had said they would 
instead they marched about two blocks away 
we have no problem at all in crashing their party because they 
certainly crashed this family sharpton had said 
marchers last weekend were met with racial slurs and chants of 
go home while some residents taunted black protesters by 
holding watermelons aloft 
i dont think bensonhurst will ever change being the people 
here are ignorant said tina treglio a resident who watched 
saturdays march people teach their kids to be prejudiced 
theyre not talking about that the killing was senseless 
fama was ordered held without bail friday on charges of murder 
felony assault riot weapons possession civil rights violations 
harassment and menacing the other suspects have been released on 
bail of 75000 to 100000

nationalists saturday of circulating rumors of discord in the 
kremlin leadership in order to weaken it 
ligachev spoke in a 15minute tv interview broadcast a week after 
the communist party central committee warned baltic residents that 
nationalists were leading them into an abyss 
he said that while president mikhail s gorbachev patiently 
pushes his reforms people seeking to increase their personal power 
are manipulating the countrys problems and unfairly attacking the 
foundations of soviet society 
the situation demands some measures be taken but not 
certainly measures of repression or dictatorship but first of all 
political ones said ligachev 
the political situation in the soviet union has become more 
tense he said criticizing party members who are taking part in 
strikes and nationalist movements 
all sorts of nationalists and separatists are working very 
actively with the purpose of separating the leadership to weaken 
the leadership said ligachev there are a lot of rumors and 
gossip circulating and all this is not done innocently 
as an example he cited doubts about the source of last weeks 
tough central committee statement 
leaders of the grassroots peoples front movements of estonia 
latvia and lithuania which are leading the drive for local 
sovereignty have said they think the central committee statement 
was drafted by a faction of the 251member body while president 
mikhail s gorbachev was on vacation 
saturdays statement from ligachev widely considered a 
conservative force appeared to be a highlevel effort to show party 
unity on the matter some baltic activists think he sides with 
officials wanting to clamp down on the drive for sovereignty 
ligachev defended the central committee statement as the very 
one to create the most favorable conditions for restructuring and 
to speed up its processes 
officials have reported that gorbachev called lithuanian 
communist party officials to warn them the republic had gone too far 
in a government commission report saying lithuanias annexation by 
the soviet union in 1940 was an international crime 
soviet spokesmen also have said gorbachev took part in drafting 
the statement

cardinal franciszek macharski who has 
angered jews by refusing to remove a convent from beside the 
auschwitz death camp on saturday urged an end to hostility and 
hatred of judaism 
macharski roman catholic archbishop of krakow addressed several 
thousand people representing various religions who marched more than 
a half mile from birkenau along the railroad tracks used by the 
nazis to the former site of the camps giant crematories according 
to the state pap news agency 
the procession was part of a world day of prayer for peace 
organized by the church to mark the anniversary of the sept 1 
1939 invasion of poland by nazi germany 
marcharski spoke at a service at the international memorial to 
the 4 million people put to death at the sprawling 
auschwitzbirkenau concentration camp complex located in and around 
the southern polish city of oswiecim among the victims were an 
estimated 25 million jews 
here the nazi hatred killed millions of men women and 
children jews destined for the final extermination which is today 
called holocaust and shoah gypsies destined for extermination 
despised slavs especially russians and poles and many other sons 
and daughters of nations mentioned on the tablets at which we are 
standing macharski said 
pap also quoted him as saying in this terrible place the 
commitment against the evil that reigned here must be strengthened 
no to hostility and hatred towards judaism no to any contempt and 
racial hatred no to the desire to rule and conquer to contempt 
for and struggle against religion 
macharski whose archdiocese includes oswiecim has been a 
central figure in the controversy over the convent of 14 carmelite 
nuns in a building used by the nazis as a storehouse just outside 
the fence of the auschwitz camp 
jews and some other religious leaders have said it is offensive 
to have christian symbols including a tall wooden cross at a place 
that was the site of death for millions of people massacred solely 
for being jews 
polands one rabbi refused to take part in day of prayer for 
peace and only four jews were listed as participating 
macharski agreed in an accord in 1987 to move the convent to an 
interfaith prayer center farther from the camp by feb 22 1989 but 
he announced aug 10 that he was suspending the promise because of 
aggressive protests staged at the convent by some jewish groups 
after the deadline passed 
people in oswiecim and elsewhere in predominantly catholic poland 
generally support the convent and its nuns saying they harm no one 
when they pray for the camps victims thousands of whom were not 
jewish 
oswiecim townspeople also distinguish between the auschwitz camp 
where many polish political prisoners were slain and the huge 
birkenau camp a mile away designed for the mass murder of jews 
brought by train from throughout europe

for the millions of people who were born 
after world war ii the solemn ceremonies marking the 50th 
anniversary of the german invasion of this nation amounted to a 
history lesson 
for the poles who lived through the carnage the memorials 
marking the sept 1 1939 outbreak of the war have brought back a 
flood of memories 
i survived said alexandra sikorska who served as a courier 
for the polish resistance 
she said she cried watching televised memorial ceremonies from 
westerplatte the baltic peninsula in gdansk where a german 
battleship fired the first salvos of the war at a small polish 
garrison 
young people were taking a pledge and i remembered i was young 
too then all my life seems strange because my young days were at 
that time she said 
mrs sikorska 70 said when the war began she built barricades 
against nazi tanks with paving stones then she carried messages 
for the resistance 
i was always thinking that i would be taking part in everything 
until the very end she said her medal of valor dangling from her 
collar as she stood in warsaws castle square during a peace 
ceremony marking fridays anniversary 
a bronze memorial filling half a city block is being completed to 
honor the valiant but doomed stand against the germans during the 
warsaw uprising of 1944 two hundred thousand people in the city 
died in the fighting and the reprisal massacres that followed 
nationwide 6 million poles died in the war including 3 million 
jews and much of poland was reduced to rubble 
proudly wearing combat medals at the ceremony were two men who 
started the war as poles and ended it as citizens of territory 
annexed by the soviet union 
in september 1939 my friend and i were the first to fight the 
germans we had active duty that day said jozef zamojdzin still 
speaking his native polish 
they fought not to allow the enemy to tread on polish soil 
said his friend stefan sidoromek but we had to face enormous 
violence and we were not able to overcome it 
they eventually joined the polish army that the soviets allowed 
to be reformed on their territory after the germans attacked their 
former ally 
both men showed honors from the battle of monte cassino one of 
the polish armys many heroic efforts through africa and italy 
a soldier is a soldier in order to defend the homeland and to 
be victorious zamojdzin said

two magazines said saturday that a member of the 
west german parliament who held security posts in west berlin had 
contacts for years with east german intelligence agents 
the hamburgbased der spiegel and stern magazines claimed

communist east berlin 
der spiegel and stern said the west berlin constitutional 
protection office responsible for counterintelligence efforts in 
the city had since given federal prosecutors a dossier on lummers 
activities 
according to both magazines east german agents sought to 
blackmail lummer into further contacts with the use of 
compromising photographs 
the magazines said it is not known what lummer may have told the 
east german agents 
der spiegel said lummer first told west berlin security officials 
about his contacts in 1975 years after they began 
it said lummer told security officials that he went along with 
the game to find out what kind of information the agents wanted from 
him 
both der spiegel and stern reported that lummer told officials he 
had regularly informed a friend in west germanys intelligence 
service about the contacts 
the magazines quoted a spokesman for the west german intelligence 
service as saying lummer initially informed the service about the 
contacts but denied that the agency had been briefed on a regular 
basis

events that lasted into the early hours saturday 
there were air shows and a military parade friday to mark the 
aniversary of the sept 1 1969 coup that overthrew prowestern 
king idris 
gadhafi addressed a special session of the general peoples 
congress friday before reviewing the evening parade in tripolis 
central green square 
in his speech gadhafi praised the people of panama in 
confronting american imperialism and said of israel the zionist 
entity must be removed palestine is for palestinians 
he also pledged support for revolutionary movements in central 
america south africa and countries around the world 
the celebrations were attended by at least 19 heads of state 
western diplomats said their presence reflected gadhafis efforts to 
end years of international isolation due to his alleged support of 
terrorism and libyas conflicts with its neighbors 
but the diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said all 
did not go smoothly they suggested that moroccan king hassan ii 
snubbed the libyan leader and noted a summit of five north african 
countries that gadhafi had hoped to host was not held 
hassan skipped the general peoples congress session that opened 
the celebrations and then arrived at the nighttime parade 1 hours 
late he left after 30 minutes prompting an exodus by other heads 
of state

the king had not snubbed gadhafi but was too busy to attend all of 
the anniversary events 
gadhafi had hoped to preside at a summit with algeria tunisia 
morocco and mauritania to discuss forming an economic union a 
western diplomat said a committee planning the summit suspended its 
work because of disagreements over financial matters

experts and volunteers lovingly tending 
what are believed to be the first beaked whales in captivity are 
surprised the ailing young cetaceans remain alive more than a week 
after being beached 
i didnt expect them to live through the first night i 
didnt expect them to make it off the truck and into the pool 
said dr laurie gage veterinarian at marine worldafrica usa 
no ones ever seen these guys alive she said there are 
whale experts coming in from all over because theyve never seen one 
alive 
but gage staff and volunteers at the animal park where the 
whales were in stable but guarded condition saturday tried to be 
realistic about the mammals poor chances for survival and a return 
to their home at deep ocean depths 
its hard not to become attached you look at their big brown 
eyes and gage said as she watched the pair swim slowly around 
their shaded isolation tank 
alexander and nicholas were found on san franciscos ocean beach 
aug 24 and taken to marine world about 35 miles northeast of san 
francisco while scientists arent sure of their species they think 
the two are less than a year old possibly only a few months old 
their rescue excited marine mammal experts because beaked whales 
which live beyond the continental shelf and dive thousands of feet 
for squid are almost never seen except as a rare skeleton or 
carcass washed up on a beach 
so little was known about beaked whales that the experts rushed 
to the reference books gage said 
most stranded dolphins and whales are sick or hurt and nicholas 
and alexander are battling serious health problems gage said 
although they have improved somewhat since their rescue both 
still have low white blood cell counts indicating a bacterial 
infection or viruscaused immune system disorder they have been 
treated with antibiotics vitamins and steroids and force fed a 
fish shake and liquids by tubes inserted into their tail flukes 
in addition alexander developed a mild cast of pneumonia 
saturday said cecilia pelshakov a marine world spokeswoman 
nicholas the larger of the pair at 10 feet also has an 
undetermined liver problem and an accumulation of gas between the 
skin and muscles on his left side possibly caused by a blow 
two cardiologists from a local hospital have inserted three small 
tubes held in place with a mesh tank top to let the gas escape 
he seems a little more active and more comfortable gage 
said adding that it could take several days for the gas to be 
eliminated allowing nicholas to dive 
marine worlds staff was guardedly optimistic friday because the 
9foot alexander in better shape and more stable from the start 
ate three pounds of herring with the help of his handlers 
the parks staff of 16 with the help of volunteers from the 
california marine mammal center in sausalito has been watching the 
whales around the clock gage and the other handlers are delighted 
the sleek gray creatures which probably never saw people before 
are gentle and accepting of humans 
whats so remarkable to us is theyre showing such an interest 
in people said marine world spokeswoman mary oherron they 
follow the trainers around and suck on their thumbs she added 
marine mammal experts from the california academy of sciences in 
san francisco the university of california at santa cruz us fish 
and wildlife service and the natural history museum in los angeles 
have visited the 32foot diameter 3foot deep tank for a chance to 
see the beaked whales

casino gambling with the lure of big 
money and jobs for an economically distressed community has turned 
indian against indian on the st regis akwesasne indian reservation 
one of seven gambling houses on the reservation straddling the 
uscanada border has been burned and guns have been fired in 
recent weeks and the violence threatens to escalate 
pro and antigambling factions squared off again saturday when 
about 25 indians barricaded themselves inside a bingo hall but 
state police said there were no arrests and injuries reportedly were 
minor during the fracas 
the lawlessness on akwesasne is out of control said michael 
mitchell grand chief of the canadian mohawk council of akwesasne 
who has declared a state of emergency on the reservation never 
before has the threat of violence been so real 
at least 11 people were injured in a clash between mohawks and 
state troopers during a 10day standoff in july after the troopers 
and the fbi raided the casinos now a selfappointed security force 
equipped with automatic weapons the warriors society guards 
against outside intrusion and state police visit rarely and only 
under strict conditions 
on the reservation antigambling vigilante groups spontaneously 
attack the casinos whose owners employ armed security guards 
its just crazy now complete chaos said harold tarbell an 
elected chief who opposes gambling 
people are pushed into a corner because it has dragged on so 
long said edward smoke another antigambling leader theres a 
lot of people saying we have to take it into our own hands 
opponents argue against gambling on moral grounds and say it will 
attract criminal elements advocates view it as a form of economic 
development bringing millions of dollars onto the reservation 
until most of the casinos were closed following a july 20 raid 
busloads of people from both sides of the border would visit the 
reservations gambling parlors which employed about 500 people 
about a tenth of the reservations population 
mohawks who support gambling say the reservation is a sovereign 
nation not subject to state and federal laws against gambling the 
us supreme court in 1987 banned state and local regulation of 
gambling on reservations until congress allows the regulation 
but leaders of the three tribal governments that claim 
jurisdiction at st regis oppose gambling and federal and state 
authorities saying akwesasne leaders asked them to have raided the 
casinos several times in the last two raids in june and july 
authorities arrested 13 people on federal gambling charges and 
seized 300 slot machines 
the july 20 raid prompted the standoff between state police and 
mohawks with troopers cutting off the reservation from the outside 
world for several days 
after the clash state police did not return to the reservation 
until warriors society leaders set guidelines demanding that 
troopers notify them in advance when they wish to enter the 
reservation and then come in an unmarked car and wait for an escort 
state police have abided by the stipulations with one exception 
a stolen car chase that ended with troopers shooting out the tires 
of the fleeing car on indian territory the warriors society which 
was not alerted to the chase impounded the car and condemned the 
troopers for firing their weapons on indian property 
we will protect ourselves from outside forces if they come 
uninvited and do not follow the proper procedures said warriors 
spokesman mark maracle 
on tuesday shots were fired at the largest of the reservations 
casinos tonys vegas international knocking out power to it and 
another gambling parlor once before antigambling forces broke 
into tonys casino and smashed several dozen slot machines 
last sunday there was a confrontation involving more than 500 
people many brandishing bats or knives afterward firebombs were 
tossed into veronica adams newly converted casino badly damaging 
it gambling supporters blamed antigambling forces county fire 
officials suspect arson and continue to investigate 
asked who burned her casino adams shook her head in disbelief 
and said people i thought were my friends everyday people that 
live on the reservation 
they came in with guns and shot up my door adams charged 
if i am threatened again i will retaliate she said i 
tried to be calm and tried to go by the books 
maracle said there is an urgent need for the various factions to 
work out their differences without outside interference 
we dont want to be fighting indian against indian people 
said maracle whose group advocates sovereignty but has remained 
neutral on gambling 
hatred and hard feelings causes segregation in our community 
in order for the barriers to come down we have to sit down and 
reason with each other he said

premier miklos nemeth on saturday urged 
communists burdened with past mistakes to leave the party saying 
those who cannot accept reform should feel free to form new 
political parties 
also saturday orthodox marxist ferenc berenyi was quoted as 
saying his munnich ferenc society a communist party faction is not 
seeking a split but we will become a party if necessary he was 
quoted as saying by the nepszabadsag party daily 
reformist communists meanwhile published a letter drafted for the 
communist partys oct 6 congress urging a break with traditional 
communism and calling it a historical dead end 
the different factions are laying down their positions in 
preparation for the congress nemeth warned a failure at the 
congress to transform the party into an entity with broad appeal 
would result in unforseeable consequences 
after more than four decades of singleparty rule the communist 
leadership in february endorsed the concept of multiparty democracy 
and agreed to hold free elections by june in recent months dozens 
of opposition political groups and clubs have been allowed to form 
these and other changes have put hungary in the forefront of 
economic and political reform in the soviet bloc creating tension 
with some neighbors that cling to traditional and rigid marxist 
systems 
reformists also have run into opposition at home with orthodox 
marxists challenging their concepts 
partly because of the infighting the partys strength has 
diminished 
central committee secretary gyoergy fejti told a saturday rally 
at fonyodliget 90 miles southwest of budapest that an average of 
10000 members a month have left the party in recent months while 
it is attracting less than 200 new members a month 
fejti said 750000 of the countrys 10 million people now are 
party members the official mti news agency reported 
decisions reached friday by a meeting of the 113member central 
committee reflect the conflicting positions of senior party 
officials 
while rejecting a call by leading reformer imre pozsgay to 
depoliticize the work place by dismantling communist political 
organizations there committee members agreed to open factories to 
other parties 
nemeth who along with pozsgay is part of the fourmember party 
leadership was considered sympathetic to reformists even before he 
declared his support saturday 
he suggested those with ancient bolshevik concepts who 
cannot accept the necessity of radical changes form alliances 
with those circles espousing farleft concepts and practices 
we cannot complete the work of the october congress with 
people who are burdened with different mistakes and who are not 
clean let us allow them to form other parties and let us allow 
them to leave in a civilized way nemeth declared 
responding to questions from reporters before the dinner nemeth 
said he could conceive of a coalition of communist and noncommunist 
parties after the election

the bush administration together with several 
federal agencies has drafted plans to make large numbers of soviet 
jews ineligible to enter the united states as refugees according to 
a published report 
under a state department plan soviet jews who have no relatives 
or other ties to the united states would become ineligible for 
admission as refugees the new york times reported in its sunday 
editions 
at least half of soviet jewish applicants are in that category 
one result of the proposal would be to encourage the rejected 
applicants to go to israel a move israeli officials would welcome 
the times reported 
citing confidential state department documents the times 
reported that us officials hope there will be direct charter 
flights to israel from moscow for soviet jews who would be 
ineligible to settle in america under the proposed guidelines 
the united states for years has allowed soviet jews to choose 
their destinations upon leaving the soviet union 
but bush administration officials say the united states no longer 
can accommodate all of those who want to come here the times 
reported the paper said the administration is taking that posture 
because of economic burdens it would impose on the government in 
addition to the difficulty in proving that the jews are political or 
religious refugees 
soviet jewish emigration jumped from 8155 in 1987 to 18965 last 
year and is expected to exceed 48000 this year the times said 
the plan was developed secretly by a group of officials from the 
central intelligence agency the fbi the state department and the 
immigration and naturalization service 
israeli officials said they welcomed the prospect that the 
tighter us restrictions would result in more soviet jews going to 
israel the paper said in addition israeli officials said an 
influx of soviet jews would strengthen israel the times said 
while the administration is moving to restrict the influx of 
soviet jews congress has moved in the opposite direction both 
houses of congress have approved bills that would make it easier for 
soviet jews and evangelical christians to come to the united states 
as refugees 
the bush administration opposes the bills saying they would 
create large numbers of refugees who would impose large costs on the 
government 
some american and israeli officials say the persecution of jews 
in the soviet union has lessened under president mikhail gorbachev 
but many members of congress and some american jewish groups say 
gorbachevs openness policies have also given new life to 
antisemitic groups 
the administrations plan is causing debate among jewish groups 
some groups say the united states has an obligation to admit 
soviet jews after demanding for more than 15 years that moscow let 
them leave 
we dont want to collaborate with the us government on a 
selection plan that bars soviet jews without close relatives in the 
united states because that would disqualify some leaders of the 
soviet emigration movement pamela b cohen president of the 
union of councils for soviet jews told the times 
but david a harris washington representative of the american 
jewish committee told the paper a growing number of american 
jews are coming to believe that limits on refugee entry to the 
united states would not be so terrible if they result in greater 
voluntary migration to israel 
most of the administrations plan is subject to approval by bush 
secretary of state james baker 3d and attorney general dick 
thornburgh who supervises the ins and the fbi

san bernardino calif a week of testimony failed to establish 
a link between a deadly train derailment and a pipeline explosion 
here although federal officials have said they believe the crashs 
impact led to the blast 
four people were killed may 12 when a runaway southern pacific 
general freight train jumped the tracks and smashed into dozens of 
homes in a san bernardino neighborhood two people died and 31 were 
injured in the pipeline explosion may 25 
but testimony from 33 witnesses last week could not establish a 
causal link between the derailment and the explosion said lee v 
dickinson chairman of the national transportation safety board 
panel that concluded its fiveday hearings friday 
investigators have said they believe either the impact of the 
train accident or heavy equipment used to clean up debris from it 
weakened the buried pipeline near the tracks ultimately causing it 
to explode 
dickinson also said that confusion and a lack of communication 
between fire and safety officials hampered an inspection of the 
pipeline after the derailment 
the time of the accident its not the time to introduce

a senior iraqi official saturday accused 
iran of sabotaging stalled peace talks by refusing to have direct 
negotiations to formally end the 8year gulf war 
deputy foreign minister nizzar hamdoun said there can be no 
lasting and comprehensive peace while tehran rejects direct 
negotiations 
peace is like marriage it needs two partners he said in an 
interview if only one is present theres no marriage 
hamdoun was responding to a statement by iranian foreign minister 
ali akbar velayati last week in which he reiterated tehrans 
rejection of direct negotiations 
a peace settlement has been put off until the iranian 
leadership takes the crucial decision to have facetoface 
negotiations hamdoun said 
unsponsored peace talks began five days after a ceasefire 
took effect in august 1988 
but they quickly bogged down 
a major stumbling block is a dispute over the shattalarab 
waterway that forms the southern boundary between the two persian 
gulf states and is iraqs main outlet to the gulf 
iraq insists that a 1975 treaty that drew the border down the 
middle of the waterway the confluence of the euphrates and tigris 
rivers has been abrogated leaving the frontier on the eastern 
iranian bank 
iran says the treaty which gave it navigation rights in the 
watrway is still valid 
hamdoun stressed that baghdad is ready for a permanent peace 
treaty but said the iranians are dragging their feet 
velayati and iraqi foreign minister tareq aziz are in yugoslavia 
attending the nonaligned summit conference and are expected to meet 
with un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar to fix a date 
for resuming talks 
un officials said perez de cuellar will meet separately with 
velayati and aziz to explore the possibility of resuming the 
negotiations later this year

a 14party opposition coalition 
saturday chose violeta barrios de chamorro as its presidential 
candidate a newspaper publisher considered its most formidable 
choice for the feb 25 election 
the selection of the 59yearold former member of the sandinista 
government comes after two days of heated discussions by 
representatives of the national opposition union whose members 
range from communist to conservative 
virgilio godoy 55yearold leader of the independent liberal 
party was chosen as the coalitions vice presidential candidate 
coalition spokesman rene blandon said the chamorrogodoy ticket 
received 10 of the 14 coalition votes while three of the parties 
abstained and one vote was annulled 
she said supporters of businessman enrique bolanos for the vice 
presidential candidacy were refusing to accept the final vote 
viva enrique bolanos hecklers shouted while godoy delivered 
a brief message outside the coalition headquarters promising he 
would fight for a better system of coexistence 
godoy was labor minister under the sandinista government from 
1979 to 1984 and is regarded with hostility by some workingclass 
groups for introducing low wages for workers the average monthly 
wage in nicaragua is 40 
about 100 people yelled for mrs chamorro at coalition 
headquarters cheering dona violeta as she is known 
were going to fight for amnesty so that the jails open and so 
we can have forgiveness love and peace she said 
viva pedro joaquin chamorro she cried the name of her 
assassinated husband 
supporters echoed her call 
her husbands shooting death in january 1978 followed his sharp 
criticism of then president anastasio somoza through the family 
newspaper la prensa 
the killing of the popular chamorro sparked a popular uprising 
that ousted somoza in july 1979 and helped the sandinista national 
liberation front into power 
im going to repeat in memory of my husband the one thing he 
wanted for nicaragua that nicaragua will once again be a 
republic mrs chamorro promised saturday 
the fact that she does not belong to any party her widespread 
recognition and image as a strong prodemocracy figure make her the 
most formidable opposition choice for the presidential nomination 
although bolanos and godoy also had been mentioned as possible 
presidential contenders each was seen as too committed to their own 
ideologies to be a unifying symbol for such a diverse coalition 
bolanos an upperclass businessman whose land has been 
confiscated by the sandinistas is viewed as leaning too far to the 
right and being too vocal a supporter of private business 
all antisandinista groups agree their only chance of defeating 
the sandinista front is through a united opposition 
mrs chamorro never has been elected to public office her only 
role in government was as a member of the government junta from july 
19 1979 after somoza fled the country to april 1980 when she 
resigned citing ill health since then she has been a strong 
critic of the sandinistas 
mrs chamorro has the backing of the united states the 
sandinistas have called her a puppet of washington 
the sandinistas have not chosen their candidate for the february 
balloting 
they have promised free and fair elections with equal access to 
the news media 
the national opposition unions platform calls for returning 
confiscated property dismantling the sandinista peoples army 
retaining government control of foreign trade and liberalizing 
domestic commerce

baseball commissioner a bartlett 
giamatti suffered from heart disease and had a prior heart attack 
several years ago although he may not have known it an autopsy 
revealed saturday 
giamatti 51 a former yale university president died of a heart 
attack friday afternoon after being stricken at his summer residence 
in edgartown on the resort island of marthas vineyard 
dr william zane a medical examiner for barnstable county said 
giamatti died as a result of constrictive coronary heart disease 
the manner of death was natural 
the autopsy revealed that giamatti had had a mild heart attack 
several years ago zane said it was possible that giamatti had 
suffered the attack without realizing it he said 
his death came five months after he ascended from the top post at 
the national league to become baseball commissioner and eight days 
after he banned pete rose baseballs alltime hit leader for 
betting on the game 
fay vincent deputy commissioner was named acting commissioner 
saturday 
giamatti was found unconscious in his bed and in full cardiac 
arrest when officers responding to a call from one of his sons 
arrived at 3 pm he was pronounced dead about an hour and a half 
later said matthew stackpole of marthas vineyard hospital 
edgartown police said giamattis wife toni and his son who 
were with him when he died left the island in the middle of the 
night to return to their hamden conn home 
giamattis body was taken by boat saturday from the island to 
falmouth hospital the body was then driven to connecticut 
according to hospital spokeswoman kathy regis 
friends had earlier suggested that the rose affair had taken a 
toll on giamatti a chainsmoker who called cigarettes his primary 
vice 
but in an aug 18 interview with the associated press giamatti 
brushed aside the notion that we was overstressed by the rose matter 
funeral services and burial will be private according to beecher 
amp bennett inc a hamden conn funeral home a memorial service 
will be held later 
the commissioners death elicited a flood of testimonials from 
the worlds of baseball and higher education for the versatile man 
who made his mark both as a renowned renaissance scholar and a 
tough worldwise administrator 
at fenway park the home of giamattis beloved boston red sox 
the flag was lowered to halfstaff before a contest with the seattle 
mariners after word of his death reached the park 
roger angell a noted baseball historian and writer held 
giamatti in high esteem 
he was just beginning to make his contribution to baseball he 
was prepared to take the game into the future he cared about its 
history and values angell said the night of giamattis death 
he was like no other figure in sports that i can think of 
president bush a fellow alumnus of yale where giamatti was 
president from 1978 to 1986 said the two were close friends and had 
talked at length about the rose case and all through that i was 
thinking of the difficulty that he had in setting these standards 
that high and staying with it 
former secretary of state cyrus vance a longtime friend of 
giamatti and one of his neighbors on marthas vineyard called the 
death tragic 
he was a dear friend and a human being whom i greatly loved and 
admired said vance a yale graduate who also served on the 
universitys board of trustees 
on saturday an executive council of baseball club owners 
appointed vincent acting commissioner baseball officials have said 
vincent a 50yearold former chief executive officer of columbia 
pictures is the leading candidate to succeed giamatti 
fay vincent is a wonderful man said new york yankees owner 
george steinbrenner 
born in boston on april 4 1938 giamatti was only 40 when he 
became yales youngest president in 200 years he had joined the 
yale faculty in 1966 after teaching italian and comparative 
literature at princeton university 
giamatti is survived by his wife and three children marcus 
bartlett paul edward valentine and elena walton giamatti

the condition of a newborn giant panda cub 
clinging to life in an incubator at the national zoo on saturday 
worsened but finally stabilized as the tiny bear battles a serious 
infection that claimed the lives of four other cubs born there 
officials said 
the fact that she stopped declining is something we should 
cling to for hope said michael h robinson director of the 
national zoo she was going down and we stopped it 
robinson said the cubs condition worsened during the day and 
it is now in a rather grave condition it has a fever infection 
has increased and weve had to put it in the equivalent of an oxygen 
tent 
lingling a giant female panda gave birth to the 4ounce female 
cub friday morning in the panda house at the zoo the cub is 
linglings fifth if it survives it will be the first panda cub 
successfully bred in a us zoo 
zoo officials said the cub remains in a special incubator tended 
by doctors from both local veterinarian hospitals and childrens 
hospital in washington 
the cubs treatment is much like the care a seriously ill newborn 
child would receive officials said the cub suffers from a high 
white blood cell count and fluid in its lungs 
doctors said lingling is suffering from an infection and passed 
the ailment onto her cub either before or during birth 
officials are treating the panda with glucose and antibiotics a 
tiny tube pumps nutrients directly into the cubs stomach 
weve had help from a local hospital and our veterinarians are 
working hard now to try and get the infection into remission and 
hopefully to push it over into recovery he said however he 
said it doesnt look too good at all im sorry to say 
if the cub does survive immediate danger zoo officials may have 
to raise it away from its mother if she is not returned soon 
officials said there is a chance the cub may be rejected by its 
mother if it is kept too long authorities say a panda cub has never 
been successfully raised by humans 
several hours after the birth zoo officials anesthetized 
lingling and took the cub to give her a shot of immunoglobulins 
extracted from the blood of the father hsinghsing previously 
officials had been careful not to separate the mother from her 
offspring 
this really does show that our decision to remove the baby from 
lingling was a correct one robinson said if we hadnt done 
that we wouldnt have detected the infection and it would have had 
no opportunity at all to survive this way at least we have a 
fighting chance 
lingling and hsinghsing were given to the united states by the 
chinese government during president nixons visit to china in 1972 
since that time they have mated on numerous occasions but lingling 
has only given birth four times including a set of twins in 1987 
one of the cubs was born stillborn and the other three 
including both of the twins died shortly after birth linglings 
longestlived cub one of the twins lived four days before dying of 
the same infection threatening her latest offspring 
pandas are an endangered species fewer than 1000 have been 
counted worldwide lingling and hsinghsing are the only giant 
pandas on permanent display in the united states

mozambican rebels claimed saturday that 
hundreds of cuban combat troops have entered the southern african 
country to help government forces fighting in the countrys 
12yearold civil war 
a mozambican national resistance statement said almost 600 cuban 
soldiers have arrived in maputo in the past week and warned the 
presence complicates ongoing peace talks 
there was no immediate comment on the claims from president 
joaquim chissanos marxist government 
peace talks between the guerrilla organization and mozambican 
church leaders representing the government resumed this week in 
nairobi kenya no details of the negotiations have been released by 
either side or kenyan mediators 
during talks last month the two sides said they exchanged peace 
plans 
the rebel statement released in lisbon and signed by the rebels 
resident delegate manuel frank said the cubans are members of 
motorized infantry units it said they arrived between aug 25 and 
monday in the mozambican capital and more are slated to arrive next 
week 
according to frank government officials claim the cubans are 
mozambicans returning from training in east germany 
the rebel claims come as cuba is involved in a phased withdrawal 
of about 50000 troops in another southern african country angola 
under an agreement in exchange for south africa pulling out its 
troops from angola and granting namibia independence 
mozambique receives military aid from the soviet union and its 
allies and has accepted several hundred soviet cuban and east 
german advisers 
but the only foreign troops known to be fighting the rebels 
alongside mozambican government forces at present are 12000 
zimbabwean soldiers protecting an oil pipeline and road and rail 
links from mozambiques indian ocean ports to their landlocked 
nation 
saturdays guerrilla statement said the government has yet to 
answer the rebels call for direct talks 
south africa used to back mozambiques guerrillas but says it 
ended its support in 1984 when it signed a mutual nonaggression 
pact with mozambique 
no government now openly supports the rebels who are accused of 
widespread atrocities against civilians

raised to be a gracious hostess and 
housewife violeta barrios de chamorro has been thrust upon the 
political stage to play a leading role in turbulent nicaragua 
she was selected saturday as the presidential candidate of a 
14party opposition coalition for the feb 25 general election 
dona violeta as she is called by supporters and enemies is a 
strong prodemocracy figure and her lack of formal political 
affiliation makes her a unifying symbol for the national opposition 
union coalition members range from communist to conservative 
parties 
mrs chamorros life resembles that of president corazon aquino 
of the philippines both women come from wealthy families married 
politically ambitious men and embarked on what they thought would be 
a behindthescenes life 
both became widows their husbands felled by assassins both 
picked up their husbands political torches and continued the work 
with very little preparation experience or ambition of their own 
pedro joaquin chamorro was shot down on a managua street corner 
in january 1978 allegedly at the direction of then president 
anastasio somoza his death provoked a civil war that culminated 
with somozas ouster and the sandinista national liberation front 
taking power in july 1979 
mrs chamorro joined the provisional governing junta after somoza 
fled the country but resigned 10 months later pleading bad health 
later she said the leftist sandinistas had betrayed nicaraguans by 
failing to fulfill their promises of democracy 
recently she has said the sandinistas are worse than somoza 
mrs chamorro has remained faithful to her husbands memory and 
her first words to the crowd at coalition headquarters saturday 
night were viva pedro joaquin chamorro 
in an interview published by her familys opposition newspaper la 
prensa shortly before the 10th anniversary of the sandinista 
revolution mrs chamorro said of her husbands death 
it wasnt simply the traumatic change that every woman suffers 
when her husband dies what happened to me was something more 
profound 
i went from being a simple housewife to being a political 
fighter following in my husbands footsteps 
la prensa a critic of somoza and then of the sandinistas was 
shut down for a year then reopened in october 1987 as part of the 
sandinistas promises for more democracy 
the sandinistas accuse mrs chamorro and la prensa of being 
instruments of imperialism and of the central intelligence 
agency and lately of being supporters of somozas hated national 
guard 
yet la prensa continues to have one of the largest circulations 
in the country and its editorial policy is summed up by pedro 
joaquin chamorros slogan that nicaragua will again be a 
republic 
the political divisions in nicaragua are felt even within the 
chamorro family of her four children two are prominent 
antisandinistas and the other two are progovernment 
mrs chamorros brotherinlaw xavier chamorro is editor of the 
progovernment newspaper el nuevo diario

romania on friday demanded the united nations 
withdraw from circulation a totally incoherent and venomous 
human rights report criticizing the countrys communist leadership 
western and third world members of a un human rights panel 
instead urged un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar to 
investigate the personal situation of the reports author dumitru 
mazilu 
mazilu has been held incommunicado in bucharest since 1986 when 
he was asked to write a report on human rights and youth for the 
un subcommission on the prevention of discrimination and 
protection of minorities 
he submitted the report last month and it was published as an 
official un document last week 
mazilu termed conditions in romania nightmarish he charged 
the population was ruled by fear and subject to abject poverty while 
the leadership lived in luxury 
the subcommission voted 124 with two abstentions that mazilu 
update his report and travel to geneva to discuss it at the next 
annual meeting in 1990 
a romanian government official gheorghe chirila said the report 
violated un standards of impartiality and should not have been 
published 
it is a totally incoherent venomous text deprived of any 
meaning he said we demand that the document be withdrawn 
immediately from circulation 
romanian authorities alleged mazilu lacked the mental 
capacity to write an objective report they have said he is too 
ill to travel to geneva to appear before the subcommission 
dumitru mazilu continues to be a retired person for reasons of 
health he enjoys a respectable pension he is free chirila said 
but he acknowledged bucharest has confiscated mazilus passport 
suggesting he was a citizen whose presence abroad would harm the 
romanian state 
in a letter sent with his report mazilu said he feared for his 
life and for his family 
delegates of the 26member subcommission technically are 
independent of their governments government delegations and private 
groups are allowed to take part in debates as observers

china has completed a fouryear drive to 
demobilize 1 million soldiers including 600000 officers an 
official daily said saturday 
the china daily quoted an official of the civil affairs ministry 
as saying it had found civilian jobs for the last 16000 
exservicemen and women in the program 
senior leader deng xiaoping in 1985 announced plans to reduce the 
peoples liberation army of 42 million by 1 million to help reduce 
military spending and make the red army a trimmer more modern 
fighting force 
the troop cutbacks originally were to be made in one year but 
ran into delays reportedly because of resistance from older 
officers reluctant to give up benefits attached to their military 
rank 
the ministry said its basic policy was to return people to the 
area from which they were recruited it said that of 700000 army 
personnel resettled since last year about 200000 recruited from 
cities and towns found jobs in enterprises and government 
institutions the remainder usually returned to their homes in the 
countryside it said 
chinas military in recent years has suffered budgetary pressures 
as the reformist government shifted spending priorities to economic 
development areas defense industries have been ordered to switch to 
producing consumer goods and money for new weapons systems has been 
scarce 
in 1988 defense received 749 percent of the budget less than 
half its share before 1980 and defense spending in actual terms is 
expected to fall about 6 percent after inflation in 1989 
the army played a key role in suppressing the prodemocracy 
protests of apriljune however and observers speculate military 
leaders will use that as leverage to push for a bigger defense 
budget

but although democratic and republican leaders agree on the need 
to help polands new governments demonstrate it can outperform the 
communist regime it replaced there is little sense of how much 
additional money can be squeezed out of an already overburdened 
budget 
overall there is growing unease on capitol hill that the means 
available do not match the magnitude of the global problems waiting 
to be addressed 
these include how to deal with the challenge to the authority of 
the government of colombia by narcotics racketeers how best to wage

the collapse of peace talks just a month 
before vietnam says it will withdraw its troops from cambodia may 
have guaranteed a new period of bloodshed for that turbulent land 
the 19nation peace talks that ended in paris on wednesday 
offered an opportunity to end nearly 11 years of war but 
negotiators could not overcome the deepseated hostility between the 
vietnameseinstalled government and the khmer rouge the largest 
member of the guerrilla coalition 
the hosts of the paris conference france and indonesia are to 
begin consultations within six months to arrange a second round of 
talks other diplomatic initiatives will continue 
interviews with two dozen officials in vietnam and cambodia

confusion corner is the nickname for 
the only trafficlight intersection in town 
it could describe most parts of this 25yearold community as 
federal banking regulators begin seeking a buyer for the development 
company that owns more than 10 percent of the towns land and nearly 
all of the major recreation and public facilities 
residents are looking for reassurances that life will continue as 
always amid the sprinklerfed lawns and bicycles leaning unlocked 
against evenly spaced palms on the western edge of the everglades 
the one thing i keep repeating is dont worry nothing is 
going to change but as soon as they hear the federal government is 
involved they panic said carl strunk president of land resources 
corp which came under federal control in may 
land resources is among the more curious jetsam of the nations 
savings and loan crisis which has coughed up other odd thrift 
institution holdings from llamas to a desert bordello 
land resources was acquired in 1984 by security savings and loan 
of scottsdale ariz which previously owned a 64 percent stake and 
paid off the companys 100 million debt to citicorp when the 
thrift was declared insolvent this year regulators seized its 
assets 
its strange for sure said william crocker appointed by the 
federal deposit insurance corp to oversee security savings which 
had about 1 billion in assets many sampls had real estate but to 
own part of a town is really unusual 
this past week crocker said 60 to 80 information packets would 
be sent to potential bidders around the world the rundown of whats 
for sale includes 29000 home lots two 18hole golf courses a 
1700seat auditorium a building supply store a weekly newspaper 
and a 121room hotel with a restaurant 
although land resources has sold many of its former holdings 
including two shopping centers and a bowling alley it remains the 
largest employer of the towns 25000 residents 
crocker said financially qualified bidders will be given tours of 
lehigh acres later this month bids accompanied by a 250000 
deposit should be reviewed in november and a deal completed before 
christmas he said 
crocker would not name parties that already have expressed 
interest and said only that the property is valued in the eight 
figures 
this spring miamibased general development corp offered about 
625 million for land resources which also has smaller real estate 
holdings in the central florida towns of sebring and interlachen 
but the fdic called off the sale 
strunk predicts land resources which had about 45 million in 
revenue last year will be purchased by an established development 
firm interested in maintaining operations rather its breakup value 
im convinced the whole of this company is worth more than the 
sum of its parts said strunk 
lehigh acres like much of the everglades fringelands was 
part of a large cattle ranch network before the postwar development 
boom in 1954 about 60500 acres of the lucky lee ranch was 
purchased to create a new town in lee county named for confederate 
gen robert e lee land resources acquired the property in 1968 
original plans were for a retirement haven for northern workers 
in one section targeted for extelephone employees the streets bear 
names such as switchboard and long lines 
although nearly 90 percent of the lots are deeded there are few 
buildings outside the main roadways only blue road signs stand on 
the many overgrown gridpattern streets stretching into scrubpalm 
brush 
but other sections of lehigh acres are typical smalltown 
america churches banks a small hospital two chinese restaurants 
and a struggling industrial park 
doing some theoretical calculation strunk said lehigh acres has 
the potential for about 400000 residents if everyone came down to 
build on the lots they own 
thats a long way away he admitted lehigh acres is presently 
growing by about 1000 residents annually and land resources still 
brings families down for subsidized vacations to tour the community 
and timeshare units less than half the residents now are retirees 
with the others mostly commuting to fort myers about 12 miles 
northeast said strunk 
were just like any small town anywhere he said it just 
happens that a failed sampl owned part of it 
but word of the federal takeover is a tender subject 
in july strunk wrote a frontpage article in the companyowned 
lehigh times newspaper in an attempt to soothe local apprehension 
about the sale strunk also has discouraged the nearly 500 land 
resources employees from discussing the pending sale with reporters 
this place is mr and mrs middle america its dayton ohio 
and detroit mich they are going to spend a lot of time worrying 
about this if people keep sounding alarmed said strunk i keep 
saying its not a big deal 
he may be right at the kmart lunch counter residents seemed 
more concerned with gossip than speculation on the fate of land 
resources 
this town will survive said joseph ferrante a retired new 
york police officer at worst maybe a new owner over there will 
be good it could be a change for the better

the news about queen leona may have caused a stir 
in king michaels court 
while the conviction of hotel billionairess leona helmsley on tax 
cheating charges doesnt directly affect the predicament plaguing 
junkbond king michael milken it was not a good week for people 
charged with whitecollar crimes 
in addition to leona tv evangelist jim bakker collapsed in an 
apparent breakdown during his fraud and conspiracy trial this past 
week stock speculator salim b lewis pleaded guilty to securities 
fraud charges and a chicago lawyer was sentenced to the 
longestever prison term for insider trading 
all of those events sent ominous signals about what milken risks 
if his case goes to trial milken former head of drexel burnham 
lambert incs highyield bond unit has pleaded innocent to 98 
counts of securities fraud and racketeering 
like milken all four defendants in these other cases were 
extremely wealthy helmsley is one of the worlds richest women 
all were accused of crimes that reflected arrogance greed and 
unbridled excess 
perhaps more important the judicial process in the cases of 
helmsley and the attorney alfred elliott showed that judges and 
juries are quite willing to punish whitecollar felons as harshly as 
suspects convicted for violent crimes 
that fact may have played a role in the decision by lewis to 
strike a deal with federal prosecutors in new york and plead guilty 
to three felonies for stock manipulation lewis originally had 
asserted innocence and his lawyers had called his indictment a 
piece of garbage 
although jurors in the highly publicized helmsley trial aquitted 
her of the most serious charges they were swayed by evidence that 
she flaunted the tax laws to cheat the government of 12 million by 
using falsified bills 
in a case laced with the poeticjustice atmosphere of the french 
revolutions backlash against the rich mrs helmsley faces the 
prospect of a prison stint her designer clothes doffed for an 
inmate jumpsuit her luxurious staterooms sacrificed for a skinny 
bunk mattress 
to milken and other prospective defendants in securitiesfraud 
cases the punishment given to elliott may have been even more 
unsettling the chicago lawyer who represented firms involved in 
takeovers was sentenced to five years in prison for trading stocks 
on secret corporate information to make more than 600000 in 
illicit profits 
that term is a record for insider trading and is two years longer 
than the term given ivan f boesky considered the most notorious 
inside trader in wall street history who paid the government 100 
million to settle his case and whose subsequent cooperation led to 
the milken indictment 
milkens trial isnt expected to start until next year and the 
possibility exists that he could strike a plea bargain but there 
was one intriguing disclosure this past week that suggested he might 
fight to the end 
the washington post quoted a secret securities and exchange 
commission memo as saying boesky and milken conferred in july 1986 
about how to conceal a 53 million payment the heart of the 
governments case against milken 
the sec memo raised the possibility that boesky may have been 
cooperating with the government at the time of the alleged 
rendezvous with milken and may have been ordered to entrap him if 
so milkens lawyers may have a powerful new tool to discredit the 
governments case 
in other business and economic news this past week 
government reports on the economy were generally favorable but 
one private report was less optimistic the labor department said 
unemployment steadied in august at 52 percent and revised the june 
and july jobgrowth figures upward at the same time the national 
association of purchasing management said its index of economic 
statistics suggested a serious slowdown in august 
japans preeminence in the world banking industry and its 
rapidly growing image as a stockfraud playground were reinforced by 
the merger of mitsui bank ltd and taiyo kobe bank ltd which would 
create the secondlargest banking company behind daiichi kangyo 
bank ltd immediately after the merger was disclosed japanese 
securities regulators said they were checking suspicous trades of 
stock in the two banks prior to the announcement 
takeover rumors and counterrumors roiled the airline industry 
centering on new or revised bids for united american and 
continental that could include foreignairline partners 
the merger amp acquisitions business also extended into the 
childrens entertainment industry where walt disney co acquired 
henson associates inc owner of the muppet characters the deal

as summer draws to a close over labor day 
weekend many conversations at cookouts and cocktail parties likely 
will turn to what the stock markets recordsetting august means for 
september and beyond 
unlike past years when trading often was becalmed in the summer 
with investors taking holidays away from wall street the past month 
earned a place in the history books 
most notably the dow jones average of 30 industrials finally 
achieved what several other closely watched stock performance 
measures already had accomplished reaching an alltime high after 
setting many postcrash highs 
on aug 24 the dow average made its first move into uncharted 
territory since before the oct 19 1987 crash with a 5653point 
surge to 273464 it extended the advance the last week in the 
month reaching 274336 on aug 28 the previous record of 272242 
had stood since aug 25 1987 
broader indicators turned in comparable performances the new 
york stock exchanges composite index of all listed common stocks 
repeatedly hit new highs in august as did standard amp poors 
500stock composite index 
stock buyers were motivated partly by hopes of profiting from 
acquisitions or takeover attempts much of the thrust behind the 
markets move came from airlines for instance

marvin davis was seeking the parent of united airlines the stock

management and british airways plc were formulating a bid for ual 
leaving the ownership question up in the air

expansion and the threat of a recession something economists were 
worried about earlier this summer is very remote 
regardless of what the economy does though forecasters seem to 
agree that the stock market is due for a period of consolidation
