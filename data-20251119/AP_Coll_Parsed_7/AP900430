thousands of pelicans have died of 
starvation as an oasis in australias harsh outback country begins 
to dry up killing fish the birds feed on officials say 
it is unclear how many birds have died but the carcasses of 
thousands of adult birds and their chicks can be seen covering two 
islands in lake eyre in the northern part of south australia state 
the area is also dotted with unhatched eggs 
scientist say adult pelicans have been spotted flying up to 220 
miles a day in search of food 
an estimated 200000 pelicans made their homes at lake eyre a 
more than 100milelong body of water after the oasis waters 
swelled following heavy rains in october 
but drought followed the heavy rainfall increasing the salinity 
of the lake that killed large numbers of fish the pelicans eat 
causing starvation among the birds 
many pelicans have already left the area but few of the chicks 
were expected to survive said kim lowe national coordinator of 
the australian national parks and wildlife services 
birdmonitoring unit 
lowe said he was could not explain why the pelicans chose to 
nest at lake eyre 500 miles north of their nearest breeding ground 
it is an amazing phenomenon he said it is very humbling 
to think we havent got a basic idea why they would do this sort of 
thing

in this caper a bark wont scare intruders away 
but actually encourages them to commit crimes police say tree 
thieves are coming out of the woodwork 
thefts from private lawns and nurseries this year include 230 
rosebushes four japanese yews and four bonsai trees and dozens of 
evergreens especially small ornamental ones police said 
the thieves even steal lawns rolling up the sod 
the stolen property can crop up anywhere in the thiefs 
manicured garden for example or in flybynight nurseries some 
of it might be going to chop shops that graft and sell stolen 
trees shrubs and plants 
the perennial problem appears rooted in chicago particularly on 
the south side and sprouts on spring nights when yards have been 
freshly landscaped and the ground is soft apart from christmas 
tree heists nothing like it occurs in new york los angeles and 
detroit authorities there said 
i dont think weve got the lawns or trees worth stealing 
here joked detroit police sgt william pendergast 
but jim hirst a chicago property crimes detective isnt 
laughing about 80 trees plants and lawns vanished overnight in 
the city last year 
dorothy hicks said her husband william woke one morning to 
find a hole where their beloved 2yearold juniper tree once stood 
i went outside and sure enough it was gone she said last 
week the thieves must have kept shaking and shaking it and 
pulling and pulling i could see track marks where it had been 
dragged across my sidewalk 
the little tree trimmed to appear as if it had four pompons 
was worth almost 80 she said she doesnt think shell ever see 
it again 
another juniper almost met a similar fate 
one more pull and they would have gotten it they just left 
it slumping over she said 
aside from putting lead on the trees to hold them down mrs 
hicks doesnt know what to do to protect her garden i paid 
enough putting a burglar alarm in the house she said 
hirst said it is almost impossible to catch the thieves 
one break came april 1 when a witness spotted a van parked in an 
alley shortly after a tree theft occurred at longs garden center 
police searched the van and found 2100 in evergreens 
the driver was charged with grand theft tree and the 
passenger with simple theft 
the thieves probably use the trees in their own lawns or sell 
them to unwitting buyers or to flybynight nurseries hirst said 
hirst said he wouldnt put it past them to set up chop shops to 
sell the parts 
the prospects of ending this crime hirst said are not good 
you put up a fence they steal the fence he said after 
the fence thief comes and steals your fence then your tree thief 
steals the tree

women will saddle up in june to 
participate for the first time in a horseback ride from california 
to missouri that is held each year to commemorate the pony express 
the trip along the route of the old west mail service is 
organized by the national pony express association which refused 
to allow women to ride until female enthusiasts threatened a 
lawsuit 
the reason was that we are an historical organization said 
ken martin national president of the group founded in the 1970s in 
california 
young skinny wiry fellows carried the mail for the pony 
express back in 1860 and 1861 and we try to be as authentic as 
possible there were no women pony express riders he said last 
week 
wome who paid the associations annual 10 national dues scoffed 
at the claim of authenticity pointing out that many of the riders 
are portly men over age 50 who drive pickup trucks to their 
assigned positions on the trail 
helping bring the matter to a head last fall was melba j leal 
a member of the groups california chapter since 1985 she 
threatened discrimination lawsuits if she and another woman edie 
mcelwee were not allowed to ride 
leal was angered by a new twist to the event riders overseas 
on a route through czechoslovakia austria and east germany 
edie and i found it inconceivable that women as full members 
and citizens of the united states are not allowed the same 
privileges leal said 
on april 3 1860 the legendary pony express began service 
between st joseph and sacramento calif the service gave way to 
the transcontinental telegraph 
people pay to have the associations riders carry special 
letters that include history and information on the pony express on 
the 10day commemorative trip through missouri kansas nebraska 
colorado wyoming utah nevada and california 
the cost is 5 per letter 
the mail will leave sacramento on june 8 and arrive in st 
joseph on june 17 with participants posted along the way after 
the mail reaches st joseph it will be flown to europe for the 
trip there 
the organizations national board decided last fall to let the 
state chapters decide whether women should be allowed to ride 
the state chapters have voted to condone women to ride 
martin said we will have women riders in california and nevada 
and perhaps some other states

lucie arnaz says her mother lucille ball kept 
her television on almost all the time but preferred game shows to 
situation comedies 
i dont think she liked sitcoms very much in general after a 
while arnaz said in the may 7 issue of people magazine but 
she did like to watch wheel of fortune every night whenever we 
were eating dinner it was always on i guess thats a sitcom in 
itself 
miss ball died in april 1989 
arnaz is the host for monday nights airing on cbs of the 
34minute pilot of i love lucy taped in march 1951 and never 
before seen on television 
i thought maybe the pilot would make me cry or something but

every year rep william dannemeyer offers his 
budget to the house and every year it gets crushed last week it 
was 35448 
youd think that pride would dictate that hed give up the 
folly said rep joe moakley dmass the chairman of the house 
rules committee which gave the california republican permission to 
offer his plan 
house speaker thomas s foley of washington says dannemeyer gets 
to propose his budget to the house while others are denied 
because the republicans want it and it is a genuine alternative to 
the democratic offering 
but when democrats gave dannemeyer a vote on his plan during the 
tightly constrained budget debate it wasnt because they were 
feeling a strong sense of democracy 
his proposal is one of the straw men the majority sets them up 
to get knocked down it makes their own proposals look more 
moderate more mighty and they give cover for blocking 
consideration of alternatives which might put house members on the 
spot 
dannemeyer better known for his radical antihomosexual views 
has a dream of returning the government to the gold standard 
now that the federal debt is 3 trillion huge sums would be 
saved if somehow its interest costs could be reduced annual 
deficits would shrink away 
so instead of relying on such traditional budgetbalancing 
techniques as raising revenue and cutting programs dannemeyer 
proposes the government issue goldbacked bonds and refinance the 
national debt 
only a handful mostly the most conservative members of the 
house give such talk any credence 
the budget proposed by the congressional black caucus is as far 
to the left as dannemeyers is to the right it too always fails 
the house leadership is pleased to see it debated and then put 
aside for another year 
the democrats will also let the republicans offer president 
bushs original budget which even the administration now concedes 
is hopelessly out of date 
each package is voted up or down take it or leave it 
but if a lawmaker wants to change a small part of the budget to 
for example shift money from defense to education thats not 
allowed the rules are drawn so tightly that no amendments are 
permitted only complete substitutes cleared by the rules 
committee 
theres no debate and vote on the proposal by sen daniel 
patrick moynihan dny to cut social security taxes the 
democratic national committee has endorsed the proposal but house 
leaders have found it too hot to handle 
the sweeping deficit reduction package by rep dan rostenkowski 
dill is also missing from the schedule with tax increases and 
social security cuts it might force lawmakers to make 
uncomfortable choices 
the only votes house members make will be on those substitutes 
the straw men which by the time a final vote comes this week on 
the democrats 12 trillion fiscal 1991 budget will allow the 
party leadership to claim that the house considered and voted on a 
range of views 
the desired result is to make the democratic budget the easy 
choice the sound alternative the democrats last week were 
confidently predicting victory 
but what kind of victory is earned this way 
let us not have any illusions that we are voting on truth and 
virtue here said rep bill frenzel rminn senior republican 
on the house budget committee we are voting on one tiny step 
which will move us toward the final compromise 
obviously more is going to be expected of this house and of 
this congress 
more may be expected but theres no evidence yet that more will 
be provided

indiana republicans dispirited and in 
disarray after losing the governors office for the first time in 
two decades believe indianapolis mayor william h hudnut could 
help lead a party revival 
the fourterm mayor often credited with engineering the 
revitalization of indianas largest city is running for secretary 
of state the job pays almost 29000 less than the mayors office 
and has only a fraction of the responsibility 
but the political payoff could be significant republicans 
believe if hudnut defeats incumbent democrat joseph h hogsett and 
helps the gop gain control of the state legislature for the 
important redistricting session of 1991 
a hudnut victory this year also could put the mayor in line to 
challenge gov evan bayh in 1992 many believe the firstterm 
democratic governor used the secretary of states race in 1986 as a 
springboard for his gubernatorial campaign two years later 
i think the party that wins this year particularly in terms 
of the legislative races will control the political landscape for 
the rest of this decade said hudnut 57 
party leaders believe hudnut who entered the race in early 
february already has helped the partys fundraising boosted 
morale and helped recruit legislative candidates 
the hudnut candidacy has added a spirit of enthusiasm across 
the board said state gop chairman keith luse 
that enthusiasm was missing after bayh defeated lt gov john m 
mutz in 1988 bringing an end to 20 years of gop rule at the 
statehouse republicans elected and then rejected one state 
chairman other candidates for secretary of state failed to fire up 
the troops and appointed sen dan coats spent thousands of dollars 
trying to boost his name recognition to a level hudnut already 
enjoys upon entering statewide politics 
i think the republican party since 1988 was wallowing around a 
little bit and sort of licking its wounds and was kind of 
dispirited said hudnut a former presbyterian minister 
one of the strengths i hope i bring to this effort is the 
ability to galvanize the troops to make them feel as though what 
theyre doing is important to make them feel as though 1988 is 
behind us and were moving ahead now 
that the party turned to hudnut is ironic in light of his past 
relationship with the gop hierarchy which quashed a drafthudnut 
movement before the 1988 governors race 
hudnut maintains hes long been popular with the partys rank 
and file a view confirmed by luse who said party functions have 
been filled to capacity since the mayor entered the secretary of 
states race 
that popularity could help the entire ticket and more 
important hudnut gives the party a charismatic leader who could 
turn the 1990 election into a referendum on bayhs administration 
and pose a direct threat to bayhs reelection plans some leaders 
believe 
hudnut says you never say never when asked if he wants 
someday to run for governor he said he cant afford to look ahead 
to 1992 because he considers himself an underdog against a 
wellfinanced hogsett campaign 
hogsett a 33yearold attorney who managed bayhs two statewide 
campaigns also claims hes the underdog because hudnut begins the 
race with a sizeable name recognition advantage appointed 
secretary of state when bayh became governor hogsett has never 
before run for office 
although the two candidates wont be formally nominated until 
their parties state conventions in june hudnut and hogsett 
already are touring the state regularly to take swipes at each 
other 
hogsett takes the mayor to task for 19 tax increases and 
creation of eight new taxes during his tenure hudnut says hogsett 
shows a lack of experience a lack of governmental competence 
in leveling charges about financial matters the mayor claims his 
opponent doesnt understand 
hudnut also has been on the defensive in recent weeks trying to 
explain why he visited a psychic for marital counseling before he 
and his second wife were divorced in 1988 
hudnut calls the matter personal and says he doesnt see any 
conflict between his religious training and the psychics beliefs 
in astrology and reincarnation

richard gephardt thinks maybe he was a little 
ahead of the curve on japan 
during the 1988 presidential campaign people accused him of 
bashing japan on its trade policies they called him a 
protectionist 
today however he says a lot more people are in his camp 
particularly democrats who sense a good issue for 1992 
there is a greater understanding on the part of a lot of 
people especially about our problems with japan and a few of the 
other countries where there are really significant trade access 
problems said the missouri democratic congressman 
president bush is receiving nearrecord high approval ratings in 
opinion polls but some analysts believe us trade problems with 
japan could emerge as an issue against the republican president in 
1992 
its the biggest longterm danger to the bush 
administration said democratic pollster stanley greenberg 
when bush announced friday he was removing japan from the hit 
list of countries judged by the administration to have the most 
offensive trade barriers against american products members of 
congress were quick to protest 
it is clear that japan should be on the list said sen 
donald riegle dmich our government is not using the tools that 
are available to correct this continuing hemorrhage of us capital 
and jobs 
trade access problems thats the polite term used by people 
upset by the 49 billion deficit in the us trade balance with 
japan some americans feeling the heat of competition with japan 
are apt to be less polite 
for example try the radio ad run by a suburban washington auto 
dealer 
in an accent distinctly japanese a man is heard admiring an 
american car at a fictitious tokyo auto show 
an incredulous american voice asks havent you ever seen a 
safford lincoln continental before 
only in magazines is the reply japanese have too many 
import restrictions and taxes to see one in person 
i wouldnt phrase it as japan bashing obviously said sen 
john breaux of louisiana chairman of the senate democratic 
campaign committee but i think it is a very legitimate issue 
people in the hinterlands and middle america are feeling we are 
giving away our technology 
there is a frustration americans feel over not controlling 
their own destiny said michael mccurry communications director 
of the democratic national committee 
but mccurry and other politicians questioned the longterm value 
of simply decrying japans trade practices 
bashing japan gets you the audience said the dnc official 
but you have to make a pretty sophisticated argument about what 
you would do 
ohio is one of the states where people feel hardest hit by 
competition from japan jim ruvolo the states democratic party 
chairman recalled that during the 1988 presidential campaign the 
ohio party produced and ran a television spot that directly 
attacked japanese trade practices 
when that ad ran democratic presidential nominee michael 
dukakis gained six points in the state 
frank greer a democratic political consultant said that among 
many americans there is anxiety we are slipping behind but he 
said people are as likely to blame american management practices as 
they are to point to japanese trade policies 
the japan bashing i dont think you can tell yet said bob 
teeter a republican pollster and adviser to bush i think its 
one of those things that has the potential on the surface to work 
for you and under the surface to backfire 
greenberg the democratic pollster has examined attitudes 
toward japan and said i dont think outandout bashing works 
any more you can run on putting our own house in order putting 
america first about watching out for our interests and not being 
taken advantage of and with japan as the primary example of a 
country that is taking advantage of our good will 
he said japan could become an issue against bush if there were 
an economic downturn 
i think the bush administration is seen as standing by while 
the japanese became more and more dominant would become a major 
political problem said greenberg 
attitudes toward japan differ 
in the midwest where the automobile industry has been hit hard 
politicians can attack japanese trade practices with impunity 
in california feelings are more complex 
i think theres a great concern about becoming too 
jingoistic said former california gov edmund g brown jr now 
the states democratic party chairman 
it may look good in a primary or a given state race but when 
you look at how imbedded we are in a world economy its going to be 
very difficult for somebody to get very far by bashing key elements 
of our own stability

telling bank examiners to lay off is 
definitely out of fashion in washington 
congressmen from the northeast want federal regulators to ease 
up on their regions beleaguered banking industry but theyre also 
worried about parallels to the case of the socalled keating 
five senators who face an ethics investigation for interceding on 
behalf of the failed lincoln savings amp loan 
that is making for an awkward political dance 
are some members of congress perhaps a little gunshy because 
of the bad publicity the keating five got sure theres no 
question about it said rep john lafalce dny chairman of 
the house small business committee which opened a hearing last week 
on the credit crunch 
the lincoln episode put members of congress under pressure to 
avoid asking bank regulators to relax their watch over lending 
practices 
that kind of lobbying on behalf of lincoln owner charles h 
keating jr has ensnarled five senators in the ethics probe 
democrats donald riegle of michigan alan cranston of california 
dennis deconcini of arizona and john glenn of ohio and republican 
john mccain of arizona all benefited from substantial contributions 
from keating and his associates 
but corporate executives and owners of small businesses are 
complaining that overzealous regulators are leaving them unable to 
borrow money 
the hesitancy is because of our awareness that there is an 
appropriate line that the regulators have to walk in regulating 
appropriately and in a balanced fashion lafalce said which is 
why were reluctant to speak too forcefully about it 
shady business deals dishonest accounting and excessive 
optimism combined with lax regulatory oversight led to the 
savings and loan collapse a problem concentrated in the southwest 
the taxpayerfunded bailout of the industry could cost as much as 
500 billion 
intense criticism from congress over the thrift crisis led 
regulators to crack down in the northeast 
when the crisis finally hit the congress got very aggressive 
in going after the regulators said rep joseph p kennedy ii 
dmass a member of the house banking committee so the 
regulators say ok fellas you want us to get tough well well 
show you what getting tough is all about 
some lawmakers complain that regulators have responded with a 
swat team of examiners they were dispatched first to new 
england where the real estate market is in a severe slump and are 
expected to move down the east coast 
the regulators have reclassified loans as nonperforming 
have forced banks to increase their badloan reserve accounts and 
taken other steps that have led to less capital small businesses 
with longstanding lines of credit and no connection to the real 
estate industry are finding they can no longer get the working 
capital vital to their daily operations 
word first began to spread about the crackdown last 
thanksgiving but it was only in the past few weeks that kennedy 
one of the first legislators to speak out publicly about it gave 
it a high profile 
but kennedy said he has found colleagues are reluctant to speak 
out about the northeasts credit drought 
i found that there was at least initially a tremendous 
amount of concern about getting involved in a keatingfive type of 
circumstance kennedy said 
that concern was evident at last weeks small business committee 
hearing 
several lawmakers said they were concerned about their business 
constituents but repeatedly stressed their support for aggressive 
banking oversight 
for us to tell you that we have concerns about our 
constituents is valid up to a point rep jan meyers rkan 
told a witness representing federal regulators then i think its 
also important for us to tell you how important it is for you to do 
your job 
in connecticut republican rep nancy johnson and democratic 
rep barbara kennelly have met with federal officials about the 
credit problem sweeping their state but they also have emphasized 
that they favor tough banking regulations 
sen christopher dodd dconn held meetings in connecticut on 
the credit crunch but he said very loudly and clearly up front 
that the meetings he had with regulators or with bankers or with 
borrowers had to be open to the press according to jason 
isaacson dodds top aide 
but rep barney frank dmass cautioned against an 
overreaction to the keating five affair 
should we never talk to the regulators frank said if the 
argument is we should never give advice to the regulators thats 
crazy

as germans celebrate the impending end of 
their nations 41year division west german television is 
broadcasting a fourpart series on the holocaust entitled death 
is a master from germany 
the series first segment was shown on sunday a week before the 
world jewish congress meets for its first time on german soil 
the selection of meeting sites in east germany and west germany 
was intended to give from a moral perspective a jewish point of 
view on the emerging process of german unification world jewish 
congress executive director elan steinberg said in a recent 
interview 
while there have been many television reports on the holocaust 
this one promises to have greater impact because of its timing and 
thoroughness 
the sixhour show accompanies popular television journalist lea 
rosh and historian eberhard jaeckel as they travel through 12 
different countries in europe visiting sites of ghettos 
deportation and concentration camps as well as the homes of 
survivors resisters observers and war criminals 
the great achievement of this film is that it turns the 
audience into witnesses even into potential participants author 
and critic walter jens wrote in a review for the weekly 
newsmagazine der spiegel 
jens said the movie forces the viewer to ask what would you 
yourself have done what would have been your own thoughts 
in one scene an elderly jewish man tells of arriving at the 
auschwitz death camp where about 1 million jews were exterminated 
he asks his fellow prisoners where their wives and children were 
and whether they got to see each other 
they answered youve already been here an hour then theyve 
already been gassed and are being burned right now the man 
recalled 
the movie also explores the varying participation of different 
countries in the decimation of their jewish populations 
the documentarys title comes from a verse in the poem death 
fugue by poet paul celan himself a jew and holocaust survivor 
excerpts from the poem are read during the film as the camera 
pans over graves barbed wire and holocaust sites 
death is a master from germany his eye is blue he strikes 
thee with leaden bullets he strikes thee exactly the narrator

you can stomp grasshoppers spread poison 
bash em with shovels or burn the critters if you have to now 
the agriculture department says computers are the latest weapons 
if some new software being evaluated by usda experts state and 
county extension agents consultants and ranchers proves out the 
computer programs should ready for general use in another year 
officials at the grasshopper integrated pest management project 
in boise idaho said managing range livestock is so complex that 
grasshopper control requires a huge amount of information 
the computer program under development and testing is intended 
to put information into the hands of range managers including the 
latest on grasshopper population forecasts timing and selection of 
control options range condition assessments weather data and an 
economic analysis of management practices 
jim berry of the departments rangeland insect laboratory at 
bozeman mont said in a recent report that many potential users 
of the new software package have had little experience with 
computers 
in fact some may have an initial reluctance to use a 
computerbased system he said therefore the system is 
primarily menudriven responds quickly and requires little 
knowledge about computers to evaluate a variety of management 
options 
meanwhile the threat to western rangelands and crops is real 
not part of a computer program that can be turned on and off by 
somebody punching buttons 
a relative of grasshoppers the mormon cricket is merrily 
chewing its way through parts of utah and idaho these pests named 
because they attacked crops of mormon settlers in utah in 1848 are 
also being targeted by usda scientists 
last week the departments agricultural research service said a 
onecelled microbe that infects and kills mormon crickets was being 
released in field tests in southern idaho 
entomologist john henry of montana state university bozeman 
said the microbe a protozoan was found naturally infecting mormon 
crickets in colorado and utah 
once it infects a cricket the organism acts slowly taking up 
to 12 days to multiply the microbes then kill the crickets by 
consuming body fat 
it could be the most promising longterm weapon against 
them henry said 
aside from the possibility of seagulls appearing and devouring 
the crickets as they did in 1848 to save the crops of mormon 
settlers the best bet for immediate action against destructive 
insects still appears to be pesticidelaced bait and aerial 
spraying 
the antigrasshopper lobby in congress has been active lately 
including pushes by lawmakers from minnesota north dakota and 
south dakota for more action 
as a result the senate appropriations committee has added 68 
million to an emergency spending bill to help control an expected 
grasshopper surge this summer in drought areas of the northern 
plains 
the usda budget for 1990 includes only 87 million for control 
of hoppers and crickets primarily on grasslands 
sen quentin burdick dnd chairman of the agricultural 
appropriations subcommittee said only eight grasshoppers per 
square yard can cause economic losses and that some areas are 
reporting 1000 or more hoppers per square yard 
the environmental protection agency has been asked to approve an 
emergency request for the farm use of a pesticide called asanaxl 
on grasshopper eggs the epa has the request under review

a new labeling standard for organic food has 
been approved by the senate agriculture committee but a major farm 
organization says the bill needs more work 
the committee voted on friday to set a national standard for 
organically grown food and the measure will be part of the 1990 
farm bill that will be considered by the full senate later this 
year 
sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the committee said the 
legislation sets one tough national standard for organic foods 
labels will mean the food has been grown without substances known 
to be harmful to human health or to cause environmental pollution 
the house which is also working on the 1990 farm bill has not 
passed similar legislation 
but the farm bureau says the leahy bill sets a national standard 
for organic food and allows states to have tougher standards if 
they choose in the federations view this could be confusing to 
consumers and farmers 
consumers need to be guaranteed that organic food for which 
they paid a premium is produced in accordance with guidelines 
applicable throughout the country the bureaus john datt said in 
a letter to the senate panel 
datt urged leahy to hold hearings to determine an organic 
standard and submit recommended legislation to congress within 18 
months after the 1990 farm bill is enacted

donna russell says she was called by 
the lord to open her expensive lakefront house to the homeless 
but neighbors say even gods servants must obey mans laws 
town zoning officials acting on a complaint from a neighbor 
have ordered russell to stop taking in young homeless mothers and 
have threatened her with arrest 
the zoning law in this southern connecticut community of 33000 
requires that threequarters of the people living in a 
singlefamily dwelling be related by blood marriage or adoption 
even the towns zoning officer calls the restrictions outdated but 
that hasnt quieted russells neighbors 
this woman told me she only follows gods law she doesnt 
have to follow mans law said vincent smith a neighbor who 
contacted zoning officials in december after russell took in her 
first family well i told her there are laws in this town that 
have to be followed 
some residents said they suspect russell a real estate broker 
is out to make a buck perhaps to help meet mortgage payments when 
real estate sales are falling 
russell blames the opposition on snobbery and on fears that the 
presence of homeless people will hurt property values 
there are people lying all over the streets if we cant take 
care of our own brothers and sisters then what good are we said 
russell a divorced mother of three 
russell the owner of sunrise real estate in nearby bridgeport 
was showing the fourbedroom threebath house to a prospective 
buyer two years ago when she said i felt spoken to from god 
i felt really called by the lord to do this and to buy this 
particular house to do this ministry in she said 
she bought the white clapboard home on pinewood lake in 1988 for 
close to 400000 
russell said she can accommodate up to three families at a time 
shes taken in four women and their children to date two young 
mothers and their babies are now living with her she said 
she would not let a reporter inside her house to talk to the 
families nor would she let them be interviewed by telephone i 
dont want the privacy of the home exploited she said 
the town issued a series of zoning citations and eventually 
threatened her with arrest russell filed an appeal 
she plans to seek a waiver at a may 2 hearing before the town 
zoning board of appeals saying it is unconstitutional to require 
that people living under the same roof be related 
zoning enforcement officer donald murray said that if trumbulls 
zoning laws were fully enforced you could empty out half the 
town 
anyone who moves in with his boyfriend or girlfriend in a 
singlefamily home is violating the zoning law he said times 
do change and i dont think weve kept up with them 
but fred radford an official of the pinewood lake association 
is suspicious of russells motives the first thing that comes to 
mind is who is paying for this just the bare facts of it strain 
credulity he said 
russell said she is not charging the families to live with her 
they have to be people not using it as a flophouse but as a 
transition period where they can move upward and take care of 
themselves she said 
david balian director of the alpha home shelter in bridgeport 
said russell is sincere as a person can be and he said if 
enough people followed her lead homeless shelters could close up 
shop 
mary bowes one of russells friends said of the conflict 
its sad to think people would think that no one could do 
something like this from the goodness of their heart

is it a laundry hamper a mailbox no its a 
bat house 
thousands of oblongshaped bottomless bat roosts are popping up 
on tree branches house walls and garden poles throughout the 
country 
forget your belfry these wooden structures provide partitions 
and perches so that bats can hang out with some measure of privacy 
during the daylight hours 
but when the sun sets and the mosquito swarms shatter the calm 
of the night the bat patrols swoop into action one brown bat the 
most common species in the united states can gobble 500 mosquitos 
an hour according to bat conservation international your 
ultraviolet mosquito zapper cant improve on that batting average 
bci a nonprofit group based in austin texas battles the 
extinction of bats around the world and debunks commonly held fears 
about the warmblooded mammals 
most people still believe bats are blind flying mice that 
spread disease suck blood from your neck and get caught in womens 
hair said gary graham associate director of science at bci 
wrong on all counts 
bats are more closely related to men than to mice only about 
onethird of 1 percent are vampires and those all live in latin 
america and bother cows graham said 
bats can see just fine but to help them fly in the dark they 
have a sonar system that emits highpitched sounds the echo helps 
direct them to insects the system is so sophisticated they dont 
bump into womens heads graham said 
as for disease only 15 people in the united states and canada 
are known to have died in the past 40 years of rabies transmitted 
by bats far fewer than die annually from sick dogs or other pets 
bci says 
for the past four or five years bci has been selling about 
10000 bat houses a year and this year bci is trying to get more 
contact with the public and raise public awareness by getting 
commercial suppliers into the game 
gardeners supply a vermontbased catalogue house advertised 
pinemade bat houses in its january catalogue for the first time 
theyre selling very well about 300 in three months said 
steve kovarie a buyer with the firm 
the average bat house which retails for about 25 can hold as 
many as 30 female bats at a time 
usually when the females bat their lashes a male or two will 
fly into the house to visit but the males like their space so 
only about 6 would congregate in a bachelor bat house at one time 
kovarie said 
for best results experts suggest placing your bat house about 
15 to 25 feet above the ground facing the morning sun bats like 
temperatures of 80 to 100 degrees and near a source of water 
dont get impatient or insulted it could take a year or more 
for your bat house to attract its first occupants bats find their 
houses just like birds do especially if your neighborhood lacks 
natural roosts which bats prefer such as caves or hollowedout 
tree trunks 
also bats may only stay for a short while and then take off to 
roost elsewhere bats migrate seasonally and radar has tracked them 
as high as 10000 feet at a cruising speed of about 30 miles per 
hour 
bats have one of the lowest birthrates among mammals usually 
one pup per year fortunately conservationists say they live to 
be 20 nonetheless the worlds bat population has declined 
drastically in recent years because of vandalism and hunting of the 
animals in some countries 
the destruction endangers fragile ecosystems that rely on bats 
for pollination and pest control a recent bci study identified 300 
plant species in the tropics that rely on bats 
bat houses bci says aid conservation and conversation 
squatters are no problem because the bat houses are closed at 
the top and have no bottom birds squirrels and other animals 
cant stay 
and how can you tell if bats live in your neighborhood either 
watch street lamps at night to see if bats are chasing moths and 
mosquitos attracted by the light or buy yourself a bat detector 
that picks up the critters echolocation signals the device is 
batteryoperated

the gunman who assassinated carlos 
pizarro a leftist guerrilla turned presidential candidate may 
also have dealt a death blow to hopes for a peaceful end to 30 
years of insurrection in colombia 
pizarro was the leader of the april 19th movement known as 
m19 the only leftist guerrilla group to lay down its arms under a 
peace plan offered by president virgilio barco 
he had been a leftist guerrilla for 16 years and barco hoped to 
hold him up as a symbol of peaceful political participation in 
order to persuade three other active rebel groups to lay down their 
arms 
a gunman on a suicide mission killed the 38yearold pizarro 
aboard a colombian jetliner on thursday 
m19 members have said they will honor the peace pact signed 
last month but some say prospects for ending colombias armed 
insurgency now appear dimmer than ever 
the likelihood that other guerrilla groups will follow their 
path is significantly reduced if not eliminated a medellin human 
rights official told the associated press 
he spoke on condition of anonymity because three other members 
of the human rights group have been assassinated 
for the government so determined to carry forward the 
political project with the m19 pizarros death was a fatal 
blow a columnist for bogotas el tiempo newspaper wrote last 
week 
another m19 leader antonio navarro said on nationwide 
television after thursdays killing that he doubted peace was 
possible in colombia 
still navarro announced saturday that he would take pizarros 
place as the groups candidate for president 
the task of persuading the guerrillas to make peace was a 
daunting one even with pizarro alive and promising to mediate in 
the negotiations with other rebel groups 
two of those groups the revolutionary armed forces of colombia 
and the peoples liberation army have expressed interest in a 
settlement but they continue to fight army troops in rural areas 
another group the national liberation army known as the eln 
has said it will never negotiate with the government the eln 
inspired by the cuban revolution resented pizarro for cutting a 
deal with the government 
a field commander of the rebel group told an associated press 
reporter at an eln base last month that pizarro was a fool who 
was going to get himself killed 
resented by the extreme left loathed by the extreme right and 
a tempting target for drug traffickers pizarro could have been 
killed by any of the groups 
a friday editorial in el tiempo said there are so many 
questions and so much confusion that we do not dare even offer a 
hypothesis 
the boundaries separating groups suspected in pizarros killing 
are fuzzy drug traffickers have financed rightwing death squads 
to protect their rural land holdings from leftist guerrillas 
the attorney generals office is investigating the possible 
participation by elements in the military in massacres carried out 
by the squads 
traffickers anxious to destabilize barcos government may have 
killed pizarro to poison one of the presidents successes 
extreme rightists may have killed pizarro to destroy the peace 
process rightwing death squads have killed more than 1000 
leftists in the last six years 
and hardliners in military stand to benefit from pizarros 
death the instability created by the assassination has created a 
mood of crisis that may lead to more emergency measures and 
infringements on civil liberties 
with 48 hours of pizarros death president barco ordered that a 
3000 man antiterrorist police squad fighting drug traffickers be 
doubled 
pizarro made a lot of enemies among the countrys armed forces 
as the m19 carried out dramatic attacks against the government 
during 16 years of insurgency some members of the army undoubtedly 
resented their former enemy chatting with the president and 
appearing on national television 
in recent interviews pizarro admitted he was afraid but he 
said his desire to lead colombia was greater than his fear of an 
assassins bullet 
two other presidential candidates besides pizarro have been 
assassinated during the campaign for may 27 elections 
sen luis carlos galan of the governing liberal party was gunned 
down in august at a political rally in bogota and bernardo 
jaramillo of the leftist patriotic union party was killed last 
month at the citys airport 
authorities blamed those assassinations on drug traffickers 
the media citing security sources say traffickers are the main 
suspects in pizarros killing as well 
but no government official has yet said who was believed 
responsible for pizarros assassination and conflicting anonymous 
claims have been made 
galans assassination set off barcos crackdown on drug 
traffickers which was answered with a retaliatory wave of 
assassinations and bombings 
traffickers have killed nearly 300 colombians in the past nine 
months in an effort to halt the governments campaign to capture 
and extradite cocaine barons to the united states

the amounts of cancercausing dioxins in milk 
cartons coffee filters and toilet tissues are too small to pose a 
health problem according to a government report that seeks to ease 
concerns about bleached paper products 
some environmentalists have raised concern about the use of the 
products since it was discovered in recent years that traces of the 
highly toxic dioxins a byproduct of the bleaching process 
remained in the wood pulp 
the environmental protection agency was to announce its findings 
on dioxins in bleached paper later today including agency plans to 
continue pressing the industry to reduce dioxin contamination of 
paper products 
theres not enough of a risk to create a public concern an 
agency official familiar with the findings said sunday 
he said in each case the cancer risk from dioxin contamination 
of paper products was no greater than one in 1 million thats 
below the threshold where regulatory action would be considered 
but the epa continues to have serious concerns about dioxin 
contamination of waterways near some paper mills according to 
agency officials who spoke on condition of anonymity 
according to the epa findings dioxin contamination of fish near 
some of the paper mills was found to be high enough to pose a 
cancer risk of one in 1000 to people who frequently consume fish 
from those waterways 
that is a thousand times greater than the risk threshold level 
the epa normally uses when considering regulatory action in cases 
involving the contamination of food products by cancercausing 
chemicals 
a risk level of one in 1000 means one person out of 1000 
people similarly exposed would be expected to get cancer because of 
the contamination 
overall the dioxin levels in fish varied widely among the 
various mills officials said no information about specific mills 
was available 
dioxins are a family of highly toxic chemicals that cause cancer 
and birth defects the chemical is of particular concern because it 
remains in the body of any organism that ingests it and it migrates 
up the food chain 
a series of studies by the epa and paper industry revealed over 
the past five years that dioxins are a byproduct of the paper 
bleaching process and that some amounts of dioxins are transferred 
to paper products 
bleached paper is used in a variety of paper products including 
coffee filters paper towels food containers and packaging facial 
tissue toilet paper disposable diapers and milk or beverage 
cartons the most significant concern has been with products in 
direct contact with foods such as milk cartons or meat packaging 
red caveny president of the american paper institute said the 
38 operators of the 104 mills that produce bleached paper have 
joined in a 2 billion program aimed at reducing dioxin 
contamination we have been able to reduce the levels of 
dioxins almost 50 percent in the last two years he said in an 
interview 
caveny said about half of the bleached paper products now have 
dioxin levels of no more than 2 parts per trillion levels so low 
they are similar to background levels found in many food 
products similar reductions will be achieved in other products 
over the next two years as more mills make processing changes he 
said 
some environmentalists said however that no level of dioxin 
contamination is acceptable 
karen florini an attorney for the environmental defense fund 
called the industrys attempts to reduce dioxin contamination a 
step in the right direction but expressed continuing concern 
about the high level of dioxins found in fish near some of the 
paper mills 
theres no reason why consumers should have to accept any 
dioxin in their paper just because its white doesnt mean its 
pure said shelley stewart who is with the greenpeace 
environmental group

adequate housing a score of families has moved into a secondfloor 
conference room in a city government building 
vladimir i lenin kindeyed and smiling in the approved 
picture stares benevolently from the wall at a jumble of toddlers 
their bottles food packages piles of clothing and chairs pushed 
together for beds 
on april 15 the families took over the room in the government 
and communist party headquarters of moscows kiev district where 
lenins heirs have decided for generations what would be done for 
whom and when 
we wont leave here until each of us gets the key to a big 
new apartment said katya belyakova three of the children are 
hers 
the soviet housing shortage is severe a figure quoted often is 
that one in five people must share apartments 
president mikhail s gorbachev launched a muchheralded program 
several years ago to provide every citizen or family a private 
place to live by the year 2000 like many of his other reform 
schemes the plan has gone nowhere and the waiting list for 
apartments lengthens 
residents of many rundown apartments in central moscow are being 
moved to new buildings in other areas so the downtown structures 
can be renovated but building materials are anything but abundant 
mrs belyakova her husband and the children were sharing an 
apartment with three other families and the situation drove them to 
despair she said the other families quarrel over the use of the 
single toilet and other facilities and were pinching pushing and 
shouting at her children 
each family under lenins gaze in the 750squarefoot room has 
three or more children many russian couples have limited 
themselves to one or two because of the housing shortage so three 
or more is considered a family with many children 
the protesters are a mix of teachers laborers architects 
artists and engineers 
soviet law declares that the size of their families entitles 
them to new housing no more than three years after they apply but 
many of the protesters have been crowded five or more to a room for 
years 
at the square white kiev district office building children run 
in the halls while parents draft statements seek meetings with 
officials make posters and plan strategy 
protesters come and go freely but at least 15 adults and some 
of the children settle in to sleep every night 
district officials have not tried to evict them and say they 
are trying to find apartments for the squatters in a new sixstory 
building originally intended for officials of the communist party 
central committee bureaucracy 
anatoly a shchukin a deputy to the district government 
chairman says no increase is expected this year in the number of 
apartments available 
the district administration which oversees services for 166000 
people has a waiting list of 15000 and a shorter list of 
invalids military veterans heroes of labor and others with 
priority 
families with many children have such a special claim but it is 
near the bottom 
about 40 percent of the districts housing is controlled by the 
communist party or other groups so local officials are pressing 
the moscow city council for more 
shchukin said he understood the predicament of the protesters 
and there had been little conflict during the sitin protesters 
are allowed to use the buildings dining hall 
but he objected to the protesting parents having brought their 
children who must use the same toilets and sinks as scores of 
visitors to the building and are thus subjected to whatever 
illnesses those people bring with them 
but the living doesnt seem to bother either the children or 
their parents 
kostya komkov a 3yearold with a dirty face said i dont 
like it at home i like to live in the white building no place to 
play at home plenty here i like playing here 
tanya polyotova who works at a psychology clinic and has three 
children said of life in one room i look at my children and see 
them going downhill they are deteriorating day by day because of 
the conditions we live in they have neither space nor peace at 
home to develop their abilities 
larissa prikhodko said 11yearold volodya her eldest son had 
not attended school for more than a year 
she said the noise of a baby and two other children kept him up 
at night and he began falling asleep in class so she took him out 
on friday two representatives of the protesters met with an 
official of the moscow city council and came away with hope that 
the city would turn the new sixstory building over to the kiev 
district 
the building was featured in news reports and became an 
embarrassment for authorities first to the communists then to the 
supreme soviet legislature which had planned to house deputies 
there when they were in moscow 
valentin trusov chairman of the kiev district executive 
council said that an agreement had been reached to turn over 85 
percent of the apartments in the building to either afghan war 
veterans or large families 
we are going to distribute the flats openly and according to 
the priorities on the list and so it might be that not all of the 
strikers will receive apartments he said 
even if the building is turned over to district authorities 
shchukin said months will be needed to finish the work on it and 
complete the formal transfer and its 56 apartments would hardly 
make a dent even in the short priority list for housing

too many colleges are sidestepping social ills 
like alcohol abuse and bigotry that threaten campus life a new 
report says 
more than half of the college presidents surveyed in the report 
campus life in search of community said the quality of life 
at their schools was a more serious problem than a few years ago 
but the 148page report released sunday concluded that many have 
sought to sidestep rather than confront the issue 
the idyllic vision so routinely portrayed in college 
promotional materials often masks disturbing realities of student 
life the report said 
the study was a joint project of the carnegie foundation for the 
advancement of teaching in princeton nj and the american 
council on education a washingtonbased higher education lobby 
the findings were based on visits to 18 campuses interviews 
with teachers students and administrators across the nation and 
national surveys of 382 college and university presidents and 355 
chief student affairs officers conducted in 1989 
among the survey findings 
twothirds of the presidents considered alcohol abuse a 
moderate or major problem 
fortythree percent said campus crime had increased over five 
years 
one out of four presidents said racial tensions were problems 
on their campuses 
sixtytwo percent of presidents at researchoriented 
universities said sexual harassment was a moderate or major 
problem and 48 percent said the same of racial harassment 
sixty percent of student affairs officers said their campus 
had a written policy on bigotry and another 11 percent said they 
were working on one 
since the 60s the notion of universities having parental 
authority has greatly diminished said ernest l boyer president 
of carnegie in an interview but we havent found new ways to 
think about the social and civic dimensions of campus life 
universities dont know how to exercise authority even when they 
see incivility 
partly out of confusion there has been a drifting around the 
civic dimensions of campus life and nowhere is that more apparent 
than in racial and ethnic relations 
a chicano student interviewed said we carry a stigma when i 
first came here as a freshman a white undergraduate said to me 
youre here but my friend who is better qualified is not 
at another campus a black candidate for student government said 
a white student asked him is the other candidate on your ticket 
a nigger too 
blacks hispanics and other ethnic groups have formed exclusive 
clubs or unions one campus even had a white student union but 
such groups while understandable may heighten campus tensions 
the report urged colleges not to fight bigotry with restrictive 
speech codes such as the one passed several years ago by 
raciallytroubled university of michigan instead they should 
affirm freedom of expression while condemning campus bigotry in no 
uncertain terms 
the report said students must be encouraged to look beyond 
personal goals to their responsibilities to the school community 
and to society atlarge school officials in turn need to show 
genuine concern about student needs 
classrooms should be a starting point for rebuilding this lost 
sense of community students for example should be given 
opportunities to work together not just compete and the 
curriculum should have a sense of shared intellectual purpose and 
not just be a smorgasbord of courses the report said

when the russians downed a us spy plane in the 
famous u2 incident 30 years ago they also accidentally blew one 
of their own aircraft out of the sky killing the pilot the soviet 
army newspaper has disclosed 
the u2 plane piloted by francis gary powers was shot down on 
may 1 1960 disrupting a summit meeting 19 days later in paris 
between president dwight d eisenhower and soviet leader nikita s 
khrushchev and forcing the cancellation of another summit planned 
for later that year 
the newspaper red star said in the article sunday that the 
soviets mistakenly shot down a mig19 and its pilot in the 
operation 
the paper also disclosed that the soviets sent up a new fighter 
plane and ordered its pilot to ram the u2 in a suicide mission 
the new fighter reached the u2s altitude but failed to ram it 
red star said that khrushchev was atop lenins mausoleum on red 
square watching the may day parade when he learned that a soviet 
new model sa2 surfacetoair missile had brought down the u2 
the commander of the soviet air defense forces marshal sergei 
biryuzov climbed the mausoleum carrying happy news that the 
plane had been hit by the first rocket the article said and 
khrushchev standing right there on the tribune congratulated the 
marshal 
khrushchev in memoirs smuggled to the west and published in 
1974 wrote that diplomats watching the parade knew something big 
had happened because biryuzov wore a duty uniform rather than the 
parade dress worn by the other military officers in red square 
soviets hurrying to the may day parade in the ural mountain city 
of sverdlovsk saw a far different sight what appeared to be 
fireworks high in the air said the article signed by a col a 
dokuchayev 
the fiery debris was not fireworks but a soviet mig19 that was 
hit by the same type of missile that exploded behind powers u2 
and damaged it red star said in the most detailed version of the 
soviet military action 
powers mission began in pakistan and was to have carried him 
over sverdlovsk for a landing in norway 
he used neither the automatic destruction device nor poison he 
had been given in case the mission failed and he was captured at a 
collective farm near sverdlovsk he was held for three years then 
exchanged for the soviet spy rudolph abel powers published his 
memoirs in 1970 
the soviet article disclosed for the first time that the soviets 
had ordered a new model sukhoi9 fighter to pursue the u2 in an 
unsuccessful ramming attempt the su9 was unarme but was able 
reach nearly to the 70000 feet at which the u2 operated the 
report said 
the soviets also used two mig19s which were not capable of 
flying that high the pilot of one mig19 boris ivazyan reported 
to ground control that the debris from the u2 was actually that 
from a missile that had missed the u2 prompting the ground 
battery to fire another 
the next soviet missile struck the mig19 flown by sergei 
safronov 30 who was killed he was one of 21 soviets given medals 
for their role in bringing down powers and the red star article 
disclosed for the first time that he was honored posthumously 
ivazyan survived and later married safronovs widow 
us accounts say that the decision to send powers was 
controversial within the eisenhower administration the soviets had 
tried to shoot down a u2 over the same area on april 9 and some 
within the administration feared sending another mission could 
jeopardize ussoviet relations 
the u2 incident ended a thaw in ussoviet relations and was 
followed by some of the worst moments of the cold war the bay of 
pigs landing of usbacked forces in cuba in january 1961 the 
construction of the berlin wall in 1961 and the cuban missile 
crisis in october 1962

the futuristic wish lists prepared by the 
nations top admirals and generals for inclusion in a longterm 
outline of us defense needs usually dont attract much attention 
but times have changed 
defense secretary dick cheney has promised to keep congress 
informed while noting that normally he wouldnt disclose the 
results of his consultations with the service chiefs until the 
budget process was much further along 
testifying last week before congressional panels cheney even 
joked about how defense planning has changed 
used to be when you prepared a longterm plan around here 
nobody cared very much because it didnt embody much change 
commies were commies he said now because weve got all of 
these interesting new questions to address there are significant 
changes embodied in our longterm planning 
the crumbling soviet economy revolution almost everywhere in 
the warsaw pact and lowered estimates of moscows defense spending 
have focused capitol hills attention on the pentagons budget 
forecasts for the next six fiscal years 
sen david boren dokla chairman of the senate intelligence 
committee said sunday the us defense budget should be cut by as 
much as 30 percent over the next five years 
in the long run the influence of this country is not going to 
depend on military strength others dont feel the need for it 
its going to depend on our economic clout he said on nbctvs 
meet the press 
boren said it may be difficult to make deep cuts in the first 
year because many military contracts have already been let but 
said he favors the kind of lower defense spending figures now being 
prepared by the senate budget committee 
but sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee said sunday the budget panel is cutting too deeply 
we have to keep in mind there are still other dangers in the 
world including the middle east korea the pacific and including 
near home nunn said on abctvs this week with david 
brinkley program 
appearing on the show with cheney and rep les aspin dwis 
chairman of the house armed services committee on the show nunn 
called for careful planning that would allow the united states to 
reverse course if necessary 
cheney who has submitted administration plans calling for an 
inflationadjusted 2 percent annual reduction in defense spending 
called for caution 
i have to consider soviet military capabilities not just 
stated soviet intentions intentions can change overnight 
capabilities last a long time he said 
so far cheney has not outlined how his proposed 2 percent 
annual cuts would be accomplished beyond fiscal 1991 which begins 
next oct 1 however all sides acknowledge the need for an 
outline primarily because of the lengthy lead time needed for 
purchasing weapons and determining other pentagon costs 
nunn and other lawmakers have complained they cannot make 
decisions on the administrations proposed 3033 billion budget 
plan for next year until they get the pentagons longterm outlook 
i think you need a theme if youre going to get congress to do 
something which is tough which is to close bases aspin said 
sunday 
cheneys proposal last week to sharply reduce purchases of b2 
stealth bombers coupled with major spending reductions in other 
warplanes in the coming years has helped relieve some of the 
tension 
aspin one of cheneys toughest critics called the defense 
secretarys latest pronouncements a step in the right 
direction but added i dont think that thats going far 
enough

voters will take a swing at higher taxes on 
liquor and cigarettes in a referendum to finance a new complex 
intended to create jobs and keep the cleveland indians in town 
supporters of the may 8 sin tax proposal include much of 
clevelands political and business establishment which hopes to 
parlay a 344 million sportsbusiness complex into another showcase 
for a city polishing its comeback image 
union leaders including the teamsters and united auto workers 
have led the opposition arguing the tax would hit bluecollar and 
lowincome smokers and drinkers in favor of the wealthy and sports 
fans 
besides an openair baseball stadium the proposal includes a 
basketball arena and adjacent office and retail complex downtown 
we are trying to create a synergistic environment in downtown 
cleveland where this stadium and arena act as a magnet for the 
creation of jobs mayor michael r white said 
white who took office jan 1 said the project was important 
enough to clevelands future to risk a politically embarrassing 
setback with a tax defeat 
but melvin drimmer a cleveland state university professor who 
has campaigned against the stadium said the idea of building an 
openair stadium for a city with clevelands harsh climate was 
breathtaking in its stupidity 
we need a domed stadium because the weather is terrible here 
were going against the trend of every major city in america 
he said 
drimmer said plans for an 18000 to 20000seat basketball 
arena at the complex conflicted with the 13000seat cleveland 
state university arena under construction 10 blocks away he said 
the tax proposal amounted to asking people to pay for luxury 
boxes for the rich and suburban elite 
the stadium project is envisioned as a new home for the indians 
who share the depressionera openair cleveland stadium with the 
football browns the stadium seats 74483 for baseball 80098 for 
football 
the browns routinely sell out the stadium but the owners of the 
indians developerbrothers richard and david jacobs complain the 
sprawling stadium overlooking windy lake erie is unsuited for 
baseball 
the indians who averaged 16695 fans last season while 
finishing sixth have not won a pennant since 1954 
the browns would remain at cleveland stadium which is leased by 
the browns from the city and managed by a corporation run by 
browns owner art modell 
the project was expanded to include an arena in hopes of luring 
the cleveland cavaliers basketball team from the coliseum located 
in suburban richfield the cavaliers owners have not said whether 
they would move 
if approved by voters financing for half the cost of the 
project would come from taxes of 19 cents on a 12ounce glass of 
beer 17 cents on a 5ounce glass of wine 37 cents on a drink 
with 1 ounces of liquor and 45 cents on a pack of cigarettes the 
tax would last 15 years 
the remainder would come from the teams and private financing 
richard jacobs has not said directly that he would endorse 
moving the indians to a different city if the new complex isnt 
built but he supports the tax proposal as a way to provide his 
team with a new cleveland home 
asked whether the team might leave cleveland if voters dont 
approve the stadium tax jacobs said i dont have total control 
over my destiny these teams are ruled by the baseball 
commissioner and the ultimate decision would be in the 
commissioners office in his hands 
i know this that in 1985 1986 and 1987 the attendance was so 
dismal that other team owners were seriously considering why 
cleveland should still retain a franchise he said

the justice department says the trial of 
reputed drug smuggler jose abellosilva has altered the belief the 
us heartland is immune from the drug trail between the 
colombian jungle and americas inner cities 
you have a major violator being tried in federal court in 
their backyard said justice department spokeswoman harri kramer 
if they think the medellin cartel does not have its eyes on the 
midwest theyre sadly mistaken and this is demonstrable proof 
abello 35 went on trial more than two weeks ago on charges of 
conspiring to import drugs and conspiring to possess and distribute 
drugs 
he was indicted by a federal grand jury in tulsa on sept 2 
1987 the indictment accuses abello of involvement in a conspiracy 
to ship more than 1700 pounds of cocaine and 6200 pounds of 
marijuana to the united states 
abello who was arrested last year in a bogota restaurant and 
extradited in october has appeared relaxed in the courtroom 
smiling at times for a sketch artist and waving when witnesses 
identified him during testimony his wife and uncle have sat 
quietly nearby his wife rubbing wooden beads in her hands 
defense attorney richard haynes said in opening statements in 
federal court that abello has never been to oklahoma never 
called to oklahoma and no one in oklahoma ever called him 
but testimony last week from abellos boyhood friend boris 
olartemorales sought to explain why the man prosecutors contend 
is the fourth highest member of the medellin drug cartel is 
standing trial in a federal courtroom in oklahoma 
olarte said he tried unsuccessfully to arrange a meeting in july 
1986 in aruba with abello and a pilot frank palmero so they could 
combine forces to import cocaine 
about the same time near the rural oklahoma town of seminole 
authorities arrested a drug courier en route to colorado that led 
to the arrest of two drug dealers joe fagan and matthew martinich 
who agreed to work for the government 
they called olarte from tulsa and arranged to import 500 
kilograms of cocaine into the united states olarte was arrested in 
panama and brought to tulsa to face charges 
he wanted out and needed money so he said he suggested to his 
commonlaw wife that she resurrect the aruba meeting between abello 
and palmero 
after a series of alleged meetings in aruba and florida and 
phone calls and money exchanges between florida and tulsa abello 
was indicted in september 1987 
he was arrested two years later in a bogota restaurant and 
extradited here in october 
in oklahoma he may be the biggest fish elsewhere in the 
country he may not be a big fish ms kramer said of abello 
nonetheless he still is charged with conspiracy to distribute 
and that is not insignificant

convinced that their children 
were molested angry parents are digging up the soontobe 
demolished mcmartin preschool in a search for hidden rooms and 
tunnels 
a superior court jury acquitted peggy mcmartin buckey of 12 
charges and her son raymond 31 of 40 counts in connection with 
the case last january 
buckey is being retried on eight counts on which jurors 
deadlocked a dramatically diminished number compared to the 
hundreds once described as alleged victims at the manhattan beach 
school 
more than a dozen former mcmartin students had talked to 
prosecutors about a trap door tunnel or secret underground room at 
the school said deputy district attorney roger gunson but none 
was ever found 
only one student actually testified at the trial about a secret 
molestation room and he didnt indicate it was underground 
a search of the school years ago turned up no passageways or 
trap doors and no signs that floor tiles had been replaced or 
concrete had been patched gunson said 
but the parents refuse to give up 
were not letting go because we want the children to be 
believed said robert salas whose son attended the school but 
did not testify at the trial 
the tunnel story was just one of the stories they told and 
theyve been ridiculed salas said in a recent interview 
the number of parents involved in the excavation was not 
immediately known 
the mcmartin school is now owned by hermosa beach real estate 
broker arnold goldstein who plans to raze it and put up an office 
buiding he has given the parents until may 10 to do their digging 
im permitting these people to go on the property to find 
whatever they want and get it out of their system goldstein 
said it would be nice if this would all die down 
the parents are videotaping their efforts which so far include 
tearing up the school floor and digging underneath they say they 
found an area nine feet down that was filled with soft dirt and 
sealed by a patchwork of concrete this could have been an 
underground secret room where their children were allegedly 
molested they said 
deputy district attorney joe martinez one of two prosecutors 
assigned to buckeys retrial said the excavation was not requested 
by his office 
we just feel this is something between other parents and the 
owner of mcmartin he said we have a strong case we dont 
need anything more 
if they came up with something great pornographic photos for 
example of course wed be interested he added 
the final stage of jury selection for buckeys retrial is 
scheduled to begin tuesday 
the first trial lasted nearly three years and cost 13 million 
the longest costliest criminal proceeding in us history 
martinez has said he believes the retrial can be completed in 
six months

the countrys military ruler says leaders 
of last weeks coup attempt sought to end the rule of islamic law 
restore secular civilian government and seek political accomodation 
with southern rebels 
speaking to reporters for the first time since the coup was 
crushed lt gen omar hassan elbashir vowed there would never be 
a secular state in sudan 
he told a news conference held amid tight security on sunday 
that the main plotters of the overthrow attempt were leftists from 
political parties he dissolved after ousting a civilian government 
in a june 30 coup 
officials of elbashirs government say the coup attempt which 
was crushed with little fighting stemmed from a conspiracy among 
rebellious officers and politicians who issued an underground 
antijunta declaration late last year 
the declaration advocated the overthrow of the 15man ruling 
junta and the drafting of a constitution as steps toward returning 
partisan politics to sudan with the participation of rebels in the 
largely christian and animist south 
the rebels have been fighting a 7yearold civil war with the 
moslemdominated north to demand greater autonomy and economic 
reforms 
on tuesday elbashirs government executed 28 officers 
including three retired generals and a brigadier by firing squad 
for alleged roles in the previous days coup attempt a colonel was 
acquitted 
two days later eight army officers were convicted and given 
prison sentences of up to 15 years 
elbashir told reporters that the coup plotters had kept the 
runway of the khartoum airport open to allow the rebel sudan 
peoples liberation army to land troops in the capital to assist 
them in case they succeeded in overthrowing the government 
he said the government was nevertheless interested in finding a 
peaceful settlement of the civil war we will continue our 
efforts and dialogue will continue unless of course the rebel 
movement reject it 
the military leader said documents and evidence seized with the 
coup plotters revealed that they planned to assassinate leaders of 
the political parties he dissolved and blame his junta for the 
killings 
elbashir said four military tribunals were still trying an 
unspecified number of army officers involved in the coup attempt 
he added that 27 people both military and civilian were being 
tried for involvement in an earlier phase of the same plot that was 
broken up in march at the planning stage 
although sudans 34 years of independence have been largely 
under military rule never before were so many people executed 
after a coup attempt 
in 1971 two years after a coup made maj gen gaafar nimeiri 
president he had 14 soldiers and civilians shot or hanged after 
surviving a bid by communists to overthrow his regime 
sudan a traditionally secular state until september 1983 when 
nimeiri decreed sharia or the rule of islamic law

plymouth voters have rejected a measure 
that would have scrapped the towns 350year tradition of town 
meetings in favor of a 13member council and fulltime city manager 
residents of the city which calls itself americas hometown 
voted 4019 to 3354 saturday to keep the current form of 
government in which more than 100 town meeting representatives 
govern a board of five selectmen 
proponents and opponents of the measure agree however that 
some governmental changes might be necessary in the town where the 
mayflower landed 
william nolan a former board of selectmen chairman who 
spearheaded the drive to change the towns charter said town 
meetings were inefficient and no longer adequately served the needs 
of the growing town 
i dont think people are getting their dollars worth from 
government with this system nolan said sunday no one has said 
change isnt necessary 
the towns population has grown from 18000 in 1970 to about 
45000 today 
david malaguti who served nine years as a selectman called the 
charges of inefficiency baloney 
ive never seen an issue come before the town that couldnt be 
acted on quickly enough he said 
but malaguti agreed a town administrator might be needed 
although he said the basic town meeting format should remain 
unchanged 
while plymouths present system of government can be traced back 
to the first town meetings held in 1636 it has been updated 
through the years 
rather than having town meetings in which all citizens could 
show up to vote eight town representatives are elected in 
nonpartisan races in each of 13 precincts 
the 104person body meets at least annually to approve major 
decisions proposed by five selectmen who are elected by voters 
selectmen gather biweekly to oversee city operations

protest the kremlins opposition to lithuanian independence 
residents said 
it was unclear today whether moscow would ease its economic 
blockade of the breakaway baltic republic as reported over the 
weekend 
official vilnius radio said sunday the soviet union was 
increasing natural gas supplies to a large fertilizer plant at 
jonova but officials later said no additional supply had been 
received 
in a bid to pressure lithuania the soviet union has shut off 
all oil supplies and cut shipments of many manufactured goods raw 
materials and food items natural gas was cut to about 16 percent 
of normal deliveries 
as soviets began celebrating the may day holiday there appeared 
little movement toward settling the dispute over lithuanias march 
11 declaration of independence the holiday is celebrated today and 
tuesday 
the body of stanislovas jamaitis 52 was to be flown to vilnius 
from moscow this afternoon and mourned in an evening gathering and 
religious service on cathdral square said lithuanian journalist 
vilius kavaliauskas 
lithuanian radio and television broadcast announcements of the 
memorial service for jamaitis said aurimas drizhus a spokesman 
for the information department of the sajudis political movement 
lithuanian leaders were likely to speak at the ceremony on 
cathedral square drizhus said 
jamaitis will be buried wednesday in his home village of 
ezherelis near kaunas the republics second city he said 
in a tv broadcast today lithuanian president vytautas 
landsbergis discouraged other citizens from taking actions like 
that of jamaitis drizhus said 
jamaitis died thursday of burns he received when he doused 
himself with gasoline and set fire to himself in front of moscows 
bolshoi theater the theater is located in downtown moscow near the 
kremlin and red square 
the suicide recalled the selfimmolation of lithuanian student 
roman kalanta in kaunas in 1971 kalanta became a martyr of 
lithuanian nationalism in the 1970s and 1980s and the independence 
movement appeared to be preparing a similar role for jamaitis

fred m zeder ii a close friend of president 
bush says he wasnt required to tell the government that hed set 
up a private company to do business in the pacific islands while he 
was a us ambassador to the region in 1986 
there was no conflict between my official duties and my 
personal activities zeder said in a recent interview he is now 
the head of the governments overseas private investment corp 
zeder who left the state department in january 1987 three 
months after setting up his honolulubased company said he didnt 
disqualify himself from making decisions as ambassador that could 
have affected his business because there was no legal requirement 
to do so 
zeder publicly revealed his company island development 
foundation in a financial disclosure form he filed in march 1989 
when nominated for the opic job 
he neglected to disclose his involvement in island development 
in the financial disclosure form he filed in may 1987 when he left 
his position as the presidents personal representative for 
micronesian status negotiations a position that carries the title 
of ambassador 
the form requires filers to report your agreements for future 
employment zeder already had been president of the foundation 
for three months when he signed the form 
a state department ethics officer speaking on condition he 
remain anonymous said the zeder case could warrant further 
scrutiny 
in general he said there are ways to avoid a conflict 
divesting of any financial interest or not starting one recusal 
a waiver or termination 
george f jones vice president of the american foreign service 
association said the case posed problems because zeder failed to 
notify states legal office about the company 
there is basis for investigation at the very least jones 
said 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater asked about 
zeders situation said today i dont have any details on it 
im sure fred will take care of that however is the appropriate 
way 
as ambassador from 19821987 zeder signed agreements providing 
a total of 30 million in economic development aid for micronesia 
and the marshall islands 
his firm island development was set up to solicit 
participation in development efforts in those areas and elsewhere 
in the pacific rim according to the companys incorporation papers 
the firm was incorporated on oct 14 1986 four days after 
zeder had signed a treaty providing 6 million in us development 
aid for the marshall islands 
zeder said island development advised private firms on how to do 
business in the pacific he said it never received any government 
money 
but some of the 6 million a 12 million line of credit was 
used to establish a ship registry in the marshall islands that is 
being operated by a private company partly owned by zeders son 
howard blood zeder 
the registry was set up on behalf of the republic of the 
marshall islands maritime authority a local government agency of 
which howard zeder is also commissioner 
howard zeder declined in the past to reveal the exact financial 
arrangements between the maritime authority and maritime registry 
management inc the private company he heads that operates the 
registry 
howard zeder also was a director of island development which at 
one point shared office space with the marshall islands maritime 
authority howard zeder did not return a telephone call from a 
reporter seeking comment fred zeder said the state department 
approved his sons involvement in the maritime authority in 1988 
actual conflicts of interest are felonies and activities which 
give the appearance of such conflicts are prohibited by a 
presidential executive order and by state department rules 
one federal regulation bars an employee from having a direct 
or indirect financial interest that conflicts substantially or 
appears to conflict substantially with the employees government 
duties or responsibilities 
another says an employee cannot engage in directly or 
indirectly a financial transaction as a result of or primarily 
relying on information obtained through government employment 
fred zeder said none of these rules applied to his involvement 
with island development i understand that state department 
procedures may have changed somewhat since 1987 he added 
a native of new jersey who later moved to dallas zeder is a 
wealthy businessman and one of bushs closest friends they went 
fishing together earlier this month in florida 
zeder raised funds for bush during his presidential campaign 
and he and secretary of state james baker iii were the highestpaid 
advisers in bushs presidential transition office bush nominated 
zeder last year to head opic a government agency that promotes 
economic development abroad 
his name did not appear on island developments original 1986 
incorporation papers he concealed his initial involvement by 
having his attorneys and his business partner named as directors 
however zeders wife martha zeder and his lawyers told the 
associated press that zeder formed the company 
zeder hired the law firm to set up the foundation and i 
happened to be assigned to the case said lawyer alan b burdick 
who signed the charter of incorporation 
asked why he did not have the lawyers list him on the 
incorporation papers zeder said he formed it as an inoperative 
shelf corporation in case he wanted to do business after 
leaving the state department 
as ambassador zeder negotiated compacts to establish new 
political relationships with the us trust territory that is now 
palau the republic of the marshall islands the federated states 
of micronesia and the commonwealth of the northern marianas 
he also dealt with development in 1986 he signed agreements 
for a total of 30 million in us economic assistance to 
micronesia and the marshalls under two investment development 
funds the funds give grants and loans to encourage joint ventures 
and private enterprise in the regions 
incorporation papers for zeders business say it was established 
to solicit participation and cooperation in the economic 
development plans of various nations territories and other 
jurisdictions in the pacific islands 
in the interview zeder said the company obtained a few business 
clients but did not make a substantial amount of money he said 
123334 he received from the company after leaving the state 
department was repayment of a startup loan he had made to the 
company 
the 1986 incorporation papers listed the directors as peter s 
watson an attorney who is now an asian specialist at the national 
security council ronald d howard zeders business partner in a 
cruise ship company in hawaii and william quinn zeders attorney 
in honolulu 
by 1988 the companys business records show zeder martha 
zeder and their son howard as directors 
before zeder set up island development thenrep john 
seiberling dohio had tried unsuccessfully to pass a law that 
would bar us officials and their families from benefiting even 
indirectly from american money flowing to the former trust 
territory zeder lobbied against the measure

the supreme court today refused to revive a 
lawsuit that sought to strip the roman catholic church of its 
taxexempt status because of its antiabortion activities 
the court without comment left intact a ruling that abortion 
rights advocates lack the legal standing to sue the federal 
government for revocation of the churchs tax exemption 
among those challenging the churchs exemption were abortion 
rights mobilization inc the national womens health network inc 
and the long island national organization for women in new york 
the challengers also included protestant ministers and jewish 
rabbis 
their suit directed primarily at the government said the 
catholic church violated internal revenue service rules by lobbying 
against abortion rights and contributing to political candidates 
who oppose abortion 
the irs generally bars taxexempt groups from engaging in such 
political activities 
by failing to enforce its rules the abortion rights advocates 
said the irs has granted the church the equivalent of a cash 
subsidy for partisan political activity 
some of the abortion rights groups have the same taxexempt 
status as the church but their lawyers said the groups refrain 
from lobbying and making political contributions and thus suffer a 
competitive disadvantage in the national debate over abortion 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals voting 21 threw out the 
suit last september 
the appeals court said the lawsuit accuses the irs of creating 
an uneven playing field tilted to favor the catholic church 
but the appeals court said the abortion rights groups lack 
standing to make that argument because they are not engaged in 
lobbying or making political contributions 
the fatal flaw in the argument is that the groups are not 
players in that arena or on that field but are like any other 
spectator who supported a given side in public political 
debate the appeals court said 
in a dissenting opinion judge jon o newman said the taxexempt 
abortion rights groups are being penalized for obeying the law and 
staying out of some political activities 
i fail to understand why any person or organization seeking to 
challenge a violation of federal law should be denied access to a 
federal court for the reason that it is obeying the law newman 
said 
the bush administration urged the supreme court to reject the 
appeal acted on today 
the justices previously studied a different aspect of the case 
in 1988 they voted 81 to free the church from having to pay 
100000 a day in court fines for withholding documents sought by 
the abortion rights advocates 
the justices in 1988 overturned a federal judges contempt 
citation against the church and told the 2nd circuit court to rule 
on the legal standing issue 
the case is abortion rights mobilization vs us catholic 
conference 891242

the supreme court today refused to reinstate 
an award of nearly 1 million won and then lost by former 
professional basketball player ron behagen against an amateur 
basketball group 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that threw out 
behagens award 
behagen who now lives and sells insurance in the atlanta area 
has been battling in federal court since 1982 with the amateur 
basketball association of the united states abausa and its 
executive director william wall 
the organization is now known as usa basketball 
behagen said the association violated federal antitrust law and 
his constitutional rights by playing a pivotal role in ending his 
career with a sienna italy team after he had left the national 
basketball association 
a federal jury in denver agreed and awarded him 684000 a 
federal judge tacked on 180476 in attorneys fees and court 
costs plus interest 
but the 10th us circuit court of appeals overturned the award 
prompting behagens appeal to the high court 
behagen was a university of minnesota star and played seven nba 
seasons before he left to play for sienna in 1979 
even though behagen was paid 54000 and received rentfree 
housing and other benefits from the italian team the league 
nominally had amateur status then and was accountable to the 
federation internationale de basketball amateur or fiba abausa 
was a member of fiba 
americans playing in the italian league were required to have a 
fiba license and a travel permit from the organization 
behagen returned to the united states in 1980 and signed a 
contract to play a handful of games at the end of the nba season 
for the washington bullets 
when he returned to italy later that year he was barred by fiba 
from playing for the sienna team wall had informed fiba that 
behagen played for the bullets and the international group 
declared him ineligible to play amateur basketball in italy 
the distinction between amateur and professional status in 
international basketball since has been eliminated 
behagen also sued fiba which settled the case by paying him 
75000 
the 10th circuit court in overturning behagens award against 
usa basketball said congress generally exempted the group from 
antitrust law by designating it the overseer of amateur basketball 
in the united states 
but the appeals court said that even though the organization has 
monolithic control over amateur basketball it is not an agency 
of the government and therefore cannot violate anyones 
constitutional rights 
behagen said usa basketball violated his dueprocess rights when 
it stripped him of the ability to earn a living without so much as 
a hearing the appeals court said since the group is a private 
organization it does not owe behagen the same due process owed by 
the government 
the case is behagen vs usa basketball 891316

five friends of an illinois death row inmate 
who says he does not want to pursue any more appeals suffered a 
supreme court setback today in their attempt to keep him alive 
the court without comment let stand rulings that the five lack 
the proper legal standing to challenge illinois death penalty law 
in behalf of convicted murderer charles walker 
a state jury in 1983 sentenced walker to death after he pleaded 
guilty to killing sharon winker and kevin paule in st clair county 
walker later decided to abandon all appeals saying that he 
wanted to be executed 
three separate court hearings were conducted and in each walker 
was found to be mentally competent to waive his right to further 
appeals 
but five friends who sought to carry on walkers legal fight 
contend that the conditions of his death row imprisonment coupled 
with chronic alcoholism have caused him involuntarily to waive 
further appeals 
a federal judge threw out the appeal filed by walkers friends 
ruling that they did not have standing the 7th us circuit court 
of appeals upheld the dismissal last march 15 
walkers friends told the justices the 7th circuits failure 
to evaluate any prudential considerations in favor of finding that 
the five have standing will permit an execution under a 
statute of highly suspect validity before full review by the 
courts 
but just last week the justices ruled in an arkansas case that 
all others lack the proper legal standing to appeal a death 
sentence not challenged by a mentally competent defendant 
the five who filed the appeal acted on today are miriam wilson 
nadine schnurstein ronald barrow gloria abbeylyles and patricia 
vader 
the case is wilson vs lane 8981

the supreme court today refused to kill a 
lawsuit against general motors stemming from what a lower court 
called the highly charged environment of largescale layoffs 
the court without comment let stand rulings that the fraud and 
misrepresentation suit by 32 former employees of a gm subsidiary in 
clinton miss should go to trial 
those who sued had been employed at a packard electric plant in 
clinton before gm in 1983 began laying off hundreds of workers 
there and thousands elsewhere in response to a slumping demand 
for domestic automobiles 
the carmanufacturing giant negotiated with the employees union 
a separation agreement under which workers could opt for a 
severance payment instead of having their seniority and rehire 
rights preserved 
under the socalled voluntary termination of employment plan 
the 32 packard electric employees received payments of between 
10000 and 22000 when leaving their jobs 
their suit alleges that at meetings to explain the severance 
plan a gm representative said they could be rehired if new jobs 
were created the employees allegedly were told they would have to 
apply like everyone else without any consideration of seniority 
but would be eligible for rehiring 
new positions opened at the plant in 1985 but the 32 
exemployees were told the severance plan they had chosen made them 
ineligible for rehiring 
the 32 employees sued in federal court but based their suit on 
mississippi law claims of fraud and misrepresentation 
lawyers for gm sought a dismissal arguing that the proper forum 
was the national labor relations board even if a court suit were 
allowed gm said the state law claims would be preempted by 
federal labor law 
a federal trial judge and the 5th us circuit court of appeals 
ruled against gm 
the nlrb has no jurisdiction and state law governs the 
action the appeals court said it characterized the case as one 
involving alleged promises made and broken in the highly charged 
environment of largescale layoffs and shifts in the labor market 
gm then sought supreme court review 
the case is gm vs wells 891067

the supreme court today let stand a ruling 
that says the public has no constitutional right to know the names 
of jurors while they are serving in a criminal trial 
the court without comment rejected a challenge to a delaware 
judges order that kept jurors names secret during a 
muchpublicized murder trial 
lawyers for gannett co inc publisher of the news journal in 
wilmington said the judges order contradicts previous supreme 
court rulings on the publics right of access to criminal trials 
the delaware supreme court saying those previous rulings do not 
apply to the release of jurors names upheld the judges order 
last nov 13 
gannett has failed to carry its burden of establishing any 
historical tradition of constitutional dimension regarding public 
access to jurors names the state supreme court ruled 
the dispute stemmed from the wilmington murder trial of steven 
pennell who was charged with the serial torture slayings of three 
women state prosecutors sought the death penalty 
pennell was convicted of two of the murders and was sentenced 
to life in prison 
before the trials jury selection began the presiding judge 
ordered that potential jurors be identified in open court by 
numbers not their names throughout the trial only the judge 
prosecutors the defendant and his lawyers knew the jurors names 
the newsjournal had published an article offering biographical 
sketches of all the jurors in a thenrecently concluded murder 
trial and the judge was concerned the newspaper might run a 
similar article during pennells trial 
jurors were not to be sequestered and the judge said he was 
worried jurors might be harassed during the trial interfering in 
pennells right to an impartial jury 
lawyers for gannett noted that jurors had not been sequestered 
in the previous trial and that none was harassed after being 
identified in the newspaper 
but names of jurors in pennells case were not made public until 
his trial ended 
in a landmark 1980 ruling the nations highest court said the 
public has a constitutional right to attend criminal trials even 
when defendants object the justices since have expanded that 
ruling to cover jury selection and pretrial proceedings in criminal 
cases 
judges cannot abridge that right the court has said without 
articulating the compelling interests to be served by secrecy 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for gannett said by 
cloaking jurors in anonymity the bond between the jury and the 
public is weakened hearing the name of each juror called and 
relating that name to the jurors testimony during jury selection 
insures public confidence that the process is fair and the answers 
are truthful 
the delaware supreme court rejected those arguments 
contrary to the rather pietistic claims of gannett and other 
news organizations there is nothing to suggest that such actions 
undermined public trust in the judicial system the state court 
said 
delaware attorney general charles oberly iii urged the justices 
to reject gannetts appeal the conduct of the trial judge here 
did not undermine the goal of ensuring governmental 
accountability he said 
the case is gannett vs delaware 891324

the supreme court today refused to let 
colorado prosecutors use as trial evidence incriminating statements 
made by a man charged with the menacing use of a deadly weapon 
the attorneys general of 22 states had urged the justices to use 
the case to clarify just when police must give socalled miranda 
warnings before questioning criminal suspects 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that also blocked 
prosecutors use as evidence of a rifle seized from the home of the 
man charles cleburn of fremont county colo 
deputy sheriff don adler went to cleburns home sept 7 1988 
to investigate a report that someone matching cleburns description 
had menaced a young man with a rifle 
adler and a deputy who accompanied him were uniformed and armed 
adler who was on friendly terms with cleburn engaged him in 
what a state trial judge called sort of a good ol boy 
scenario 
cleburn was asked whether he had had a runin with a young man 
and whether he owned a rifle similar to the one the young man had 
described 
adler then asked cleburn to show him the rifle but said you 
dont have to let me 
cleburn made certain incriminating remarks while answering 
adlers questions and later agreed to let the deputy take the 
rifle 
after walking to his car with the rifle the deputy changed his 
mind about what to do he walked back to the house asked cleburn 
to come outside and arrested him 
prior to telling cleburn he was under arrest adler did not tell 
him of his right to remain silent or to get a lawyers help before 
answering any questions 
since its famous miranda vs arizona decision in 1966 the 
supreme court has required police to give such warnings before 
questioning criminal suspects who are in custody 
a state trial judge ruled that cleburns comments and the seized 
rifle could not be used as evidence against him and the colorado 
supreme court voted 43 to uphold that ruling last nov 20 
the state supreme court rejected prosecutors arguments that 
cleburn was not in custody when he made the incriminating 
remarks 
the state court also ruled that cleburn had not voluntarily 
given the rifle to adler by that time cleburn had nothing to 
lose the state court said 
the prior relationship between one of the deputies and the 
defendant made the questioning subtly coercive the defendant was 
in custody and the defendant had already made incriminating 
statements without the benefit of a miranda advisement the state 
court said 
the november ruling was appealed by district attorney edward j 
rogers iii and supported in a friendofthecourt brief 
submitted by colorado attorney general duane woodward and signed by 
the attorneys general of 20 other states 
citing general confusion over what amounts to police custody 
they told the court definitive guidance is needed regarding what 
type of seizure is necessary to trigger miranda protections 
the 20 states are alabama delaware florida idaho illinois 
iowa indiana kansas maine massachusetts mississippi missouri 
new hampshire north carolina ohio south carolina vermont 
washington west virginia and wyoming 
the case is colorado vs cleburn 891232

tortillas have a friend in irwin steinberg 
who thinks the mexican staple can be used in all kinds of ways 
just as bagels and pita bread are not just for lox and gyros 
steinberg is the first executive director of the newly formed 
tortilla industry association 
his first order of business to let people know a tortilla can 
be used for more than holding together the insides of a burrito or 
enchilada 
it may be wishful thinking but there is no reason why 
somebody couldnt put ham and cheese inside a tortilla and sell 
it steinberg said in a recent interview they neednt be 
limited to what is considered traditional mexican food 
bagels broke out of the jewish ethnic mold and greek pita bread 
has graduated so why not tortillas said steinberg 63 
the tortilla industry passed the 2 billion mark in 1988 after a 
decade of rapid growth he said steinberg wants to double that 
amount in the coming decade by tapping markets in the north east 
and midwest where tortillas are still largely a foreign food 
we have to turn tortillas from a commodity into a delicacy

antiabortion leaders buoyed by a show of 
strength in the nations capital say their movement needs to focus 
on pushing for legislation in state houses around the country to 
outlaw abortion 
park police estimated saturdays rally for life crowd at 
200000 while organizers said more than half a million people 
filled the grassy area on a steamy afternoon 
last years supreme court decision permitting greater state 
limits on abortions seems to have given new political vitality to 
supporters of abortion rights while also raising hopes of abortion 
opponents that the court could overturn its 17yearold roe vs 
wade decision which legalized abortion nationwide 
it looks as though the court is going to ultimately reverse 
roe dr jc willke president of the national right to life 
committee said saturday our job now is to go to the 50 states 
and convince them to pass laws to protect unborn babies 
gary l bauer president of the family research council said 
saturdays rally was a demonstration of the antiabortion 
movements strength 
at least part of the motive is to try to reverse what we feel 
is a misperception about the strength of the right to life movement 
and also to give some politicians who might be wavering a little 
bit of backbone bauer said 
kate michelman head of the national abortion rights action 
league said her sides political and election successes in a 
number of states and not saturdays crowd are the accurate 
measure of public opinion on abortion 
federal disclosure reports show the leading abortionrights 
group has nearly seven times as much money on hand as the chief 
antiabortion organization 347000 compared with 51000 
the reports also show the political action committee for the 
national abortion rights action league raised 300000 in the first 
three months of the year far more than the 7200 reported by the 
national right to life pac 
the right to life pac however is preparing to launch its 
annual direct mail campaign this spring and may close the gap 
president bush spoke to the rally by telephone hookup decrying 
the frequency of abortion in america but making no mention of 
proposals for a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion 
like you i realize that the widespread prevalence of abortion 
in america is a tragedy not only in terms of lives destroyed but 
because it so fundamentally contradicts the values we as americans 
hold dear bush said 
bush pointed to adoption as the appropriate alternative to 
abortion 
our mission must be to help more and more americans make the 
right choice the choice for life bush said 
one day your lifesaving message will have reached and 
influenced every american and until then continue to work for the 
day when respect for human life is sacrosanct and beyond question 
i know from your devotion and selflessness that this day cannot be 
far away bush said 
vice president dan quayle appeared before the group and called 
legal abortion a terrible wound which for almost two decades has 
torn at our countrys heart 
entertainment began early in the day long before the afternoon 
program of catholic cardinals television evangelists country and 
gospel singers and antiabortion leaders 
im here because i feel real strongly that babies have a right 
to live said country singer terri gibbs who brought her 
6monthold son david 
rep henry hyde rill called the other sides prochoice 
slogan a fraud he said the answer to that is madam if youre 
pregnant you have a baby you have a baby nobody should have the 
choice to kill an innocent human life once its begun

not too long ago other western european 
leaders generally viewed helmut kohl as an affable politician whose 
main concern was staying in good standing with his countrys 
conservatives 
now with the rapid approach of german unification the west 
german chancellor is probably the single most important voice in 
the 12nation european community and a far more important player 
on the world stage 
it was still in good taste even a few months ago to depict 
helmut kohl as a man with limited talents as a provincial 
politician said frances influential le monde newspaper 
today people are starting to suspect him of wanting to carve 
up his neighbors and dominate the continent the newspaper said 
saturday 
kohl firmly rejects such assertions he says a unified germany 
with a combined population of nearly 80 million will serve the 
interests of the european community 
but there appears to be little question that his new more 
important role is one he relishes 
in washington it was announced today that kohl will meet with 
president bush at the white house may 17 to discuss the ussoviet 
superpower summit which begins may 30 and german reunification 
during saturdays summit in dublin western european leaders 
said they warmly welcomed the joining of the two german states 
the declaration reflects in large part efforts by kohls government 
to dispel fears about german unification 
the 60yearold kohl dominated the postsummit news conference 
calling the ecs full support of german unification a historic 
hour 
after kohl became chancellor in 1982 the frequently repeated 
calls of his christian democratic union for a united germany were 
often dismissed as fanciful dreaming 
then came 1989 and the collapse of hardline communist 
governments across eastern europe the political transformation 
included the downfall of erich honecker kohls longtime nemesis as 
communist leader in east berlin 
a little more than four months after the berlin wall began to 
crumble on nov 9 east germans had given a kohlbacked coalition 
firm control of government in east berlin 
suddenly kohls hopes were rapidly on their way to being 
fulfilled propelled by a powerful business community eager to 
bring east germany into its economic fold 
but kohls rush to greater prominence hasnt come without 
controversy 
for several weeks the chancellor rattled europeans by failing 
to unequivically renounce german claims to lands awarded to poland 
after germanys defeat in world war ii 
he compounded his woes by seeking an apology from the poles for 
the mistreatment of millions of germans forcibly expelled from 
poland after the nazi defeat 
but things began to turn around when the chancellor traveled to 
brussels on march 9 to assuage fears among nato allies about german 
unification 
german interests must be taken into account but also the 
interests of all our friends and partners and neighbors in east and 
west must be taken into account kohl said then 
while kohl is riding high for the time being speculation is 
rising about how he will fare in national elections scheduled for 
dec 2 
many west germans are worried about the staggering costs of 
unification and kohl has been unable to ease fears that a tax 
increase will be needed to finance unification 
the decline of eastwest tensions also may help the opposition 
social democrats who have been at the forefront by criticizing 
arms buildups espousing a kind of guns into plowshares policy 
for years 
an independent poll in todays editions of der spiegel magazine 
gives kohl a 58 percent approval rating that is an increase of 4 
percentage points over a month ago but way behind kohls spd 
challenger oskar lafontaine with a 63 percent rating 
lafontaine was hurt wednesday night in a knife attack by an 
emotionally disturbed woman but was moved out of intensive care 
over the weekend 
kohl will take time out from a seemingly endless round of 
unification meetings to deliver the commencement address at harvard 
university in cambridge mass on june 7

the supreme court ordered more study today in 
a dispute over use of taperecorded evidence in prosecuting nine 
puerto rico men accused of robbing 72 million from a wells fargo 
depot in connecticut seven years ago 
the justices by a 63 vote said a federal appeals court must 
reconsider whether all the recordings made during electronic 
surveillance of members of los macheteros the machete wielders 
may be used as trial evidence 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals had ruled that some of the 
tapes may not be used as evidence because they were not sealed for 
safekeeping quickly enough 
prosecutors say members of los macheteros were involved in the 
sept 12 1983 robbery in west hartford conn 
nineteen members of the organization were indicted by a federal 
grand jury in connection with the crime 
evidence linking nine of the men to the connecticut heist was 
discovered during an investigation of a rocket attack on the fbi 
office in hato rey puerto rico 
during that investigation electronic snooping was conducted at 
six different locations in puerto rico between april 1984 and 
august 1985 
after their indictment the nine men sought to have all tape 
recordings obtained during the surveillance ruled inadmissible as 
trial evidence 
us district judge t emmet clarie in hartford after an 
eightmonth hearing supressed 378 tapes made at two of the six 
locations 
the 2nd circuit court upheld the suppression order ruling that 
government agents waited too long after the taping sessions had 
ended to have the tapes sealed and preserved 
it found a 118day delay in one instance and an 82day delay in 
the other 
the nine defendants are filiberto ojeda rios hilton e 
fernandez diamante joerge farinacci garcia elias castro ramos 
orlando gonzalez claudio issac camacho negron ivonne melendez 
carrion angel dias ruiz and luis colon osorio 
federal law requires not only that a judge authorize such 
electronic surveillance but also that a judge supervise the 
sealing of the recordings to protect against any tampering 
the law says the recordings must be sealed as soon as the 
courtauthorized surveillance period ends unless government agents 
have some satisfactory explanation for delay 
the court today rejected bush administration arguments that 
would have stretched the time in which a courtsupervised sealing 
of the evidence is required 
the justices also rejected the governments attempt to waive the 
sealing requirement if the tapes authenticity can be proved 
but writing for the court justice byron r white said 
prosecutors believed wrongly but in good faith that they were 
not required to seal the tapes until there was a meangingful 
hiatus in the investigation as a whole 
the excuse now advanced by the government is objectively 
reasonable white said and may be enough to excuse the delays in 
sealing the tapes 
but white said the excuse cannot meet the legally required 
satisfactory explanation requirement unless it was made before 
judge clarie and not just in front of the appeals court 
even though the misunderstanding now pressed by the government 
was objectively reasonable that explanation is not satisfactory 
unless it was relied on at the suppression hearing to explain 
the sealing delays white said 
the court sent the matter back to the 2nd circuit court for a 
determination of whether the governments explanation to judge 
clarie substantially corresponds to the explanation it now 
advances 
justices john paul stevens william j brennan and thurgood 
marshall although calling the issue a close question 
dissented they voted to uphold the 2nd circuit courts ruling that 
would have excluded the 378 tapes as evidence 
the case is us vs ojeda rios 8961

eight months into a study of chronic fatigue 
syndrome doctors in four cities have reported 250 possible cases 
of the mysterious malady to the centers for disease control 
about 350 physicians in atlanta reno nev grand rapids 
mich and wichita kan are cooperating with the cdc reporting 
possible cases of chronic fatigue syndrome sometimes termed the 
yuppie disease 
the study which began in september has yielded 250 cases said 
dr walter gunn of the atlantabased cdc it will be another year 
before preliminary results from the study are available he said 
today 
the cdc is trying to determine the prevalence and incidence of 
this illness gunn said some people think its increasing but 
we really dont know yet 
in the last two months the cdc has received about 2000 calls 
seeking information on chronic fatigue syndrome mostly from 
people who think they have it or know somebody who has it gunn 
said 
symptoms of the illness first named in 1988 but described in 
medical literature back to the 1700s include the debilitating 
fatigue which gives it its name as well as fever sore throat 
muscle weakness and discomfort headaches and insomnia 
studies have suggested anger or depression may be implicated in 
chronic fatigue syndrome but theres no suggestion it is an 
imaginary ailment 
it definitely exists gunn said we are finding people who 
meet the case definition 
the study involves reporting of cases to the cdc by private 
doctors those physicians do not refer their patients to the cdc 
and the centers are not seeking case reports from the public

engineers fixed a jammed 
antenna on the 15 billion hubble space telescope early today and 
said they were well on the way to recovering full use of the vital 
communications system on the orbiting telescope 
the telescope has not been able to communicate with the ground 
through its high speed antenna since the astronomy satellite was 
released from the space shuttle discovery last wednesday engineers 
working on the problem discovered that an antenna had been jammed 
by a cable 
the national aeronautics and space administration said that 
commands sent during the night gingerly repositioned high 
gain antenna number two 
successful centering of the antenna marked a major milestone 
in the process of recovery use of the high gain antenna system 
nasa said 
the telescope has two high gain antennas which are supposed to 
link it with orbiting relay satellites without the antennas it 
was impossible for engineers to proceed with the calibration that 
was supposed to be started almost immediately 
two attempts to use the antenna system were unsuccessful 
saturday because a computer sensed the obstruction if engineers 
had sent commands to force movement of the antennas the computer 
system would have shut itself down as it did earlier 
discovery returned to earth on sunday gliding to a desert 
landing and stopping through the use of a new set of brakes 
about 20000 people cheered as the space shuttle swooped out of 
orbit concrete runway at edwards air force base calif the five 
crew members returned home to houston later in the day 
the astronauts expressed satisfaction in putting the 12ton 
telescope in orbit 
we had a spectacular mission an incredible opportunity to be 
a part of what i think will be one of the most historic events the 
space shuttle program has ever figured in mission specialist 
kathryn sullivan said 
in addition to correcting the antenna problem controllers at 
nasas goddard space flight center in greenbelt md continued the 
monthslong process of checking out the 43foot telescope nasas 
most expensive unmanned spacecraft 
our hope is that well be fully operational within a week 
said deputy project manager jean olivier the first pictures i 
still feel are approximately a week away scientific data will 
follow in a month or two 
engineers working on the communications problem with the space 
telescope found that an antenna that should move freely in four 
directions was jammed 
the antenna apparently got caught behind a power cable that had 
bowed out from its normal position against the 15foot arm 
supporting the antenna spokesman mike harrington said 
discovery pilot charles bolden said the results from hubble will 
be worth the wait 
you wont see anything in a week you wont see anything in a 
month thats worthwhile but over the next few months the next few 
years youre going to see some absolutely amazing things i 
think he said 
commander loren shriver guided the shuttle to a 649 am pdt 
touchdown after a slackening of 40 mph winds that had threatened to 
delay the landing the other crew members are mission specialists 
bruce mccandless and steve hawley 
it was the first time a shuttle used carbon brakes similar to 
those on passenger jets william lenoir nasa associate 
administrator for space flight said shriver reported the brakes 
felt good firm and comfortable 
the brakes are believed to slow shuttles more quickly and last 
longer they may eventually allow routine landings at the more 
confined kennedy space center in cape canaveral fla instead of 
in the wideopen mojave desert 
discovery blasted into orbit from cape canaveral on tuesday on a 
fiveday mission a day later the crew deployed the telescope 
which had been waiting to take its place in space since 1983 it 
had been delayed by technical problems and the 1986 challenger 
accident 
hubbles lens was uncovered friday but that action and the 
movement of one of the antennas moved the telescope too much and an 
automatic system shut down the hubbles electronics it took more 
than a day to restore them 
discovery had been in orbit 380 miles up 70 miles higher than 
any shuttle has ever flown the orbit was dictated by the need to 
put the telescope above earths distorting atmosphere 
astronomers hope to use the telescope to look back to almost the 
beginning of time studying stars and galaxies so distant their 
light has taken 14 billion years to reach earth they hope to 
determine how and when the universe was formed currently estimated 
at 15 billion years ago 
the next shuttle launch is scheduled for may 16 when columbia 
and seven astronauts will carry a 100 million observatory named 
astro into orbit

dozens of prague streets were 
renamed over the weekend in a move symbolizing the democratic 
changes sweeping the country after four decades of communist rule 
official media said 
streets named after marxist politicians or historical events 
linked to the communist movement were renamed some streets 
regained the old names they had before the communists came to power 
in 1948 others were given new names 
the reports were carried sunday and today by the staterun 
television and official ctk news agency 
president vaclav havel attended the ceremony sunday marking the 
name changes at pragues downtown palacky square 
havel who still lives in an apartment on a nearby quay said he 
welcomed the name changes 
as a citizen i do care whether i live on a quay named after a 
relatively unimportant philosopher of the past century like 
friedrich engels or on a quay of alois rasin a man who has 
contributed to this state to an extent equal to czechoslovakias 
first president tomas garrigue masaryk havel said in a brief 
speech 
rasin was considered one of the founding fathers of the 
czechoslovak republic after world war i engels a german social 
philosopher was a close collaborator of karl marx the founder of 
communism 
some streets had to be renamed several times during the decades 
of communist oneparty rule to keep in line with ideological 
changes as former communist heroes fell out of grace with their 
successors 
a main avenue leading to the capitals airport was renamed four 
times in 42 years beginning with the name of the soviet war war ii 
hero gen georgi konstantinovich zhukov and ending up as lenin 
street 
on sunday the avenue was named after edward benes the

two greenpeace activists scaled the 
georgiapacific headquarters building in downtown atlanta today to 
protest the use of chlorine in the companys paper products 
the two identified by greenpeace as dj lachappelle 24 of 
washington dc and laurel greenberg 31 of boston used 
climbing equipment to scale about 150 feet up the skyscraper and 
unfurled a banner reading take the poison out of pulp 
greenpeace contends the use of chlorine to bleach paper produces 
the dangerous chemical dioxin 
atlanta police sgt pj lynn said they would be arrested once 
they climbed down but there were no plans to go up and get them 
an ambulance and a rescue unit were standing by and police blocked 
off a side street next to the building 
theyre in hot water they will be arrested when they come 
down said lynn adding that the charges would be criminal 
trespass and reckless conduct 
about 200 bystanders many of them office workers on the way to 
their jobs stopped to watch the protest when it began during the 
morning rush hour 
greenpeace spokesman brian hunt said lachappelle and ms 
greenberg who were clinging to a cable planned to stay up on the 
building until this afternoon when the environmental protection 
agency planned a news conference in washington to announce its 
findings on dioxins in bleached paper 
in washington epa officials who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the report concludes that the amount of cancercausing dioxins 
in items like milk cartons and toilet tissues is too small to pose 
a health hazard to consumers but the agency is concerned about 
dioxin contamination of waterways near some paper mills 
hunt said greenpeace chose georgiapacifics building for the 
protest because the atlantabased company is the biggest pulp mill 
operator in the nation 
beth zoffmann georgiapacifics director of corporate 
communications said chlorine produces only a minute quantity of 
dioxin and added we believe our products are safe 
pointing up at the two protesters she said this creates a 
far greater risk than the entire production of dioxin in pulp they 
are creating an unnecessary risk to themselves and the people on 
the ground

here at a glance are highlights of actions 
taken monday by the supreme court 
 
corporate mergers 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
the court unanimously ruled that state regulators consumers and 
other private citizens may use federal antitrust law to break up 
corporate mergers 
the justices said the california attorney generals office is 
empowered by the clayton act of 1914 to challenge a 25 billion 
merger of the lucky and alpha beta supermarket chains 
any opponent of a merger not just the federal government can 
sue to force divestiture in a completed merger the court said 
california officials said the supermarket merger could cost 
consumers 440 million more a year in grocery bills 
 
catholic church 
 
the court refused to revive a lawsuit by abortion rights 
advocates that sought to strip the roman catholic church of its 
taxexempt status because of the churchs antiabortion activities 
without comment the court left intact a ruling by the 2nd us 
circuit court of appeals last september that the abortion rights 
advocates lack the legal standing to sue the federal government for 
revocation of the churchs tax exemption 
 
drug tests 
 
the court rejected an appeal by a labor union and let the 
government force thousands of transportation department employees 
in sensitive jobs to take random drug tests 
the union the american federation of government employees had 
contended that the tests violate the workers privacy rights but 
only justice thurgood marshall voted to hear arguments in the case 
four votes are needed to grant such review 
 
gm layoffs 
 
the court refused to kill a fraud and misrepresentation lawsuit 
against general motors brought by 32 former employees of a gm 
subsidiary in clinton miss the court said the suit should go to 
trial 
the plaintiffs had worked at a packard electric plant in 1983 
when gm began laying off hundreds of employees there 
they opted for a voluntary termination of employment plan after 
a gm representative allegedly told them they could be rehired if 
new jobs were created but when new positions opened in 1985 the 
exemployees were told they were ineligible for rehiring 
lawyers for gm had sought a dismissal arguing that the proper 
forum was the national labor relations board 
 
jurors names 
 
the court let stand a ruling that says the public has no 
constitutional right to know the names of jurors while they are 
serving in a criminal trial 
without comment the court rejected a newspaper publishers 
challenge to a delaware judges order that kept jurors names 
secret during the muchpublicized murder trial of steven pennell 
pennell was convicted of the torture slayings of two women and 
sentenced to life in prison 
gannett co inc which publishes the news journal in 
wilmington had challenged the presiding judges decision not to 
identify jurors by name in court during the trial 
 
 
taped evidence 
 
the court ordered more study in a dispute over use of 
taperecorded evidence in the prosecution of nine puerto rico men 
accused of robbing 72 million from a wells fargo depot in 
connecticut seven years ago 
by a 63 vote the justices said a federal appeals court must 
reconsider whether all the recordings made during electronic 
surveillance of members of los macheteros the machete wielders 
may be used as trial evidence 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals had ruled that some of the 
tapes may not be used as evidence because they were not sealed for 
safekeeping quickly enough 
the law requires that recordings must be sealed as soon as the 
courtauthorized surveillance period ends unless government agents 
have some satisfactory explanation for delay

an imprisoned former aide to samuel r pierce 
jr today contradicted the former housing secretarys assertions 
that he did not make decisions or take a direct hand in deciding 
who got federal housing subsidies 
dubois l gilliam once deputy assistant secretary of housing 
and urban development told a house investigative panel that the 
policy while i was at hud dealt explicitly with political 
favoritism 
if you were wellconnected in political circles your 
application got strong strong consideration he said 
gilliam who once was in line to become pierces executive 
assistant is serving an 18month prison sentence on federal 
conspiracy charges involving abuse of hud programs 
he began today the first of three days of testimony before a 
house panel that has spent a year developing the hud scandals and 
was testifying under a grant of immunity from further prosecution 
rep tom lantos dcalif chairman of the investigating 
subcommittee called gilliam the key missing piece in the jigsaw 
puzzle of the hud scandal during the reagan years 
lantos asked gilliam if he would agree with statements pierce 
made in a magazine interview last september and to his committee in 
may 1989 saying he never told his top assistants to fund 
particular projects seeking hud grants 
i know for a fact the secretary made decisions on hud 
grants gilliam said 
he said that deborah gore dean once pierces executive 
assistant would not allow approval of hud grants under the 
secretarys discretionary program without first clearing it with 
him 
gilliam said that at his suggestion pierce ordered a career hud 
employee transferred because the employee had raised suspicions 
about a financial commitment for a proposed project offered by a 
former pierce aide lance wilson who was then working for a wall 
street investment firm 
gilliam agreed with lantos description of wilsons financial 
commitment as fraudulent lantos described pierces order 
transferring david sowell as in some ways the single most 
sickening aspect of the hud scandals 
the new york times citing 12 hours of interviews with gilliam 
in washington and at the prison where he is serving his sentence 
quoted gilliam as saying politics was a big part of how hud 
operated and pierce was involved in all of that so was the white 
house there was influence from 1600 pennsylvania avenue 
the times quoted gilliam as saying pierce came to trust me 
because i was smart i could remember things without writing them 
down i knew how hud programs operated and i kept my mouth shut 
pierce has invoked his fifth amendment right against 
selfincrimination in refusing to testify before the committee 
probing allegations of influence peddling mismanagement and 
political favoritism in federal subsidies 
gilliams testimony about udag grants takes the congressional 
investigators into a program largely ignored in previous hearings 
at hearings later in the week he is to testify about grants under 
other programs including several administered directly from the 
secretarys discretionary fund 
we definitely will open up new areas lantos said in an 
interview friday he will deal with projects involving the 
secretary 
a special prosecutor arlin adams is conducting a more narrow 
investigation of actions by pierce and other top officials in 
another program that provided subsidies for rehabilitation of 
lowincome rental housing 
gilliam received a federal courts grant of immunity sought by 
lantos panel that means his testimony cannot be used against him 
he has been in washington for two weeks going over hud documents 
and preparing for the testimony with committee staff attorneys 
he has a very good memory said staff director stuart 
weisberg particularly when you give him actual documents 
gilliam is to return to the federal prison camp at lompoc 
calif when his testimony is complete lantos said gilliam has 
received no reduction in sentence or other inducement to testify 
bob plotkin one of pierces lawyers denounced the hearing as 
a modern version of the inquisition he said pierce will be 
unable to publicly respond to the testimony because of the special 
prosecutors investigation 
plotkin said the committee did not respond to his request to be 
briefed on the expected testimony or to be allowed to question 
gilliam afterward 
gilliams attorney charles nesbitt did not return a reporters 
telephone calls 
several of pierces top aides have also cited their 
constitutional rights in refusing to testify before the government 
operations subcommittee on employment and housing among them were 
deborah gore dean and lance wilson former executive assistants to 
pierce 
gilliam worked in huds community planning and development 
office which gave him oversight of the udag program and a 
technical assistance program paid for through the secretarys 
discretionary funds former hud officials have described him as a 
trusted pierce aide and agency documents show many funding 
requests were routed through him 
gilliams prison sentence stems from a may 1989 plea agreement 
in a case in which he was charged with steering bond and 
construction work for a biloxi miss project to associates and 
relatives who later shared the proceeds with him 
the charges involved activities while he was directing a 
community development block grant technical assistance program 
between 1984 and 1987

when army officers tried recently to 
overthrow nigerias government their battle cry renewed a conflict 
that has bedeviled nigeria since independence the coexistence of a 
relatively wealthy largely christian south and a poorer mainly 
moslem north 
for africas most populous nation which sits at the confluence 
of christianity and islam on the continent the relation of its two 
halves has long been a source of tension and violence 
the middleranking officers who launched the april 22 uprising 
sought to expel the five powerful northern states from the 21state 
federation they claimed the north which has had a dominant 
position in politics since independence in 1960 was exploiting the 
rest of the country 
military sources said 30 people were killed in fighting around 
the military headquarters and national radio station president 
gen ibrahim babangida who seized power in a coup in 1985 escaped 
and remained in power 
he responded to coup plotters charges that he planned to 
install himself as life president by promising a transition program 
to return power to civilians by 1992 
though few nigerians answered the coup leaders radio appeal for 
support for a few hours the rebels held the floor on state radio 
in addition to complaining about northern domination they accused 
the government of corruption and said its austerity program was 
meant to enrich military commanders 
nigerias media probably the freest in black africa ridiculed 
rebel charges the government was sadistic in carrying out austerity 
measures 
but no newspaper denied the allegation of an unfair distribution 
of wealth and development between the verdant oilrich south and 
arid agriculturebased north oil produces more than 90 percent of 
nigerias foreign currency earnings the north at the edge of the 
sahara desert produces mainly meat and yams the nigerian staple 
they drain our wealth with their corruption and nepotistic 
patronage just like that oil line rushes our oil from the south to 
the north said one southern businessman 
we always have petrol shortages in the south but you never 
hear of cars queuing for petrol in the north he added he asked 
that his name be withheld 
the asymmetry in the production and sharing of the national 
wealth has never been so prominently highlighted commented the 
magazine this week sharing of the national burden as well as 
the national booty must be done with some modicum of fairness 
coup leaders complained about the removal from the cabinet in 
january of two leading southerners defense minister lt col 
domkat bali and internal affairs minister john shagayi babangida 
assumed command of defense and internal security leaving no 
southerners in key positions and inviting charges that his cabinet 
is heavily weighted in favor of northern moslems 
similar fears of domination led to the coup and countercoup of 
1966 that erupted into the 196770 biafran war at least half a 
million civilians and 100000 soldiers died when easterners tried 
to secede from the federation the easterners who like other 
southerners mainly practice christianity and traditional religions 
had accused northerners of dominating the nation 
had the latest coup attempt succeeded the result could have 
been another civil war in this country of 100 million wrote 
columnist richard akinnola wrote in the independent vanguard 
newspaper 
most northerners speak hausa or fulani while yoruba is the main 
language in the south and ibo in the east english rule brought the 
three disparate groups together the northerners have tended to 
hold power because the yorubas and ibos remain split 
every attempt at an election has mirrored the friction between 
the groups even the holding of a reliable census has been 
unattainable since independence since each group claims to be in 
the majority 
the stateowned daily times spurned the rebels saying we are 
not only tired of coups but also feel insulted by the periodic 
emergence of selfappointed messiahs 
but it added sundays events have once again raised the 
troublesome question of the role of the military 
the newspaper made no reference to the aug 27 1985 barracks 
coup in which babangida seized power from a military government

editors note the writer was in massawa when it was last bombed

facilities his story could not be filed until he left eritrea

the sovietbuilt mig jet fighter 
screamed over this red sea port at 6 pm racing down the coast 
from the north then came what sounded like a single explosion 
followed by a violent shaking 
about 60 eritreans mostly women and children sat in the 
basement of one home it is their daily shelter from sunup to 
sundown from the threat of ethiopian air raids on the strategic 
city of massawa 
the rebel eritrean peoples liberation front captured the city 
feb 11 three days after launching a major new offensive in its 
29year war for independence 
a series of seemingly random attacks on massawa by the ethiopian 
air force began april 4 two were staged april 22 bringing the 
total to six last month 
in the late morning a mig fired a single rocket toward the 
citys port facilities it struck bare ground toppling a nearby 
shed already damaged in a previous raid and causing one slight 
injury 
the evening raid however was devastating 
it dropped not one but two cluster bombs on a poor residential 
and market area about 800 yards away across a narrow causeway a 
pillar of smoke rose several hundred feet over the target 
many of the children cried in fear as they hid in the basement 
some of the women were moaning softly or crooning comfort to the 
young as the plane flew overhead 
except for some nearby warehouses that stored donated grain 
meant for famine victims in eritrea massawas port itself has been 
undamaged about 25 tons of wheat and other foodstuffs were 
destroyed in earlier raids 
these raids are against civilians they are designed to kill 
and terrorize the people said haile menkerios an economist who 
sits on the rebel central committee 
the ethiopian government has denied it purposely targets 
civilians but there were no rebel military installations anywhere 
near the scene of the latest air attack 
visiting journalists arrived at the scene of the latest strike 
just as rescue efforts were beginning the bodies of dead and 
wounded were strewn about many victims were children 
the raid just before sundown came as residents were beginning 
to emerge from hiding previous raids have taught them to stay 
sheltered during the day from an air force that usually flies on a 
9to5 schedule 
theyve never come so late said menkerios of the evening 
attack this was deliberate they knew theyd find people out and 
about at this hour 
the rebels later said 50 people died and 110 were injured the 
night of april 22 that nearly doubled the death toll from the 
previous five raids bringing the combined fatality count to 110 
more than 350 people have been injured many of them seriously 
some of the dead were loaded on trucks others were buried in a 
nearby mass grave hastily dug by a bulldozer the city has been 
without electricity and running water since its capture by the 
rebels in february and storage of bodies in the heat is impossible 
the eritrean rebels accuse israel of supplying the cluster bombs 
to the marxist government of president mengistu haile mariam both 
the ethiopians and the israelis deny it 
a cluster bomb explodes before hitting the ground showering an 
area with dozens of smaller bombs each carrying roughly the 
explosive force of a mortar round they are particularly effective 
against massed troop formations 
massawa is one of two strategic harbors that have traditionally 
handled most of ethiopias trade and international relief supplies 
for millions of people threatened with starvation in the face of 
war and drought 
the eritrean front has been fighting for control of ethiopias 
northernmost province since 1961 a year after the former italian 
colony of eritrea lost its autonomy and was forcibly annexed by the 
late emperor haile selassie 
rebels hold other towns and villages in eritrea and with 
backing from other guerrilla armies are seeking to overthrow the 
marxist regime

the seabrook nuclear power plant has been 
shut down for the third time in less than six weeks prompting 
critics to converge on the state capital today to call for the 
reactor to be junked 
officials had hoped the 65 billion plant would produce its 
first nucleargenerated electricity early this week but seabrook 
spokesman david scanzoni said that milestone now has been pushed 
back until late may at the earliest 
ron sher spokesman for new hampshire yankee the utility that 
runs the plant said the reactor was brought to a halt saturday 
night to modify a turbine on its nonnuclear side 
he said the shutdown would last four to six weeks 
representatives from at least five antinuclear groups planned a 
news conference at the legislative office building in concord to 
talk about the latest shutdown as well as other events since 
seabrook received its operating license from the nuclear regulatory 
commission on march 15 
roy morrison of the clamshell alliance called the plant a 
piece of junk and said the shutdown is another example of why 
seabrook shouldnt be allowed to operate 
seabrook which was originally scheduled to begin operating in 
1979 has been plagued by regulatory delays and cost overruns that 
drove its owner public service company of new hampshire to seek 
bankruptcy protection in 1988 more than 3000 people have been 
arrested in protests against the plant since 1976 
the latest shutdown was the result of tests indicating that 
electrical feedback could cause a 200foot shaft in the turbine to 
vibrate beyond specifications sher said 
the plant began to crank up to full power on march 20 but was 
shut down two days later for adjustments 
it shut down again a week later because of questionable readings 
from sensors on the turbine scanzoni said 
scanzoni who announced the shutdown saturday said that 
testing is all about finding areas where improvements can be 
made well take all the time thats necessary were not schedule 
driven

the difference between a mistress and a 
prostitute will be explored in the trial of a former playboy model 
accused with her twin sister of failing to pay taxes on 11 
million they received allegedly for sexual favors 
the twins allegedly spent alternate nights with david kritzik 
an elderly businessman for more than five years until june 1987 
when he was attacked and beaten in his apartment by an unknown 
intruder he died last year at age 89 
the defense won a victory this morning even before the trial of 
actress and model lynnette harris 35 got under way in federal 
court at a pretrial hearing judge thomas curran ruled 
inadmissible an affidavit that kritzik had given a federal agent 
before he died 
ms harris is accused of accepting 745000 from kritzik her 
sister leigh ann conley who allegedly received 406000 is to go 
on trial in june 
the government alleged the money was paid in exchange for sex 
ms harris attorney dennis coffey insisted kritzik gave her the 
money out of affection 
the case against the twins raises questions about the subtle 
legal differences between mistresses and prostitutes and income and 
gifts officials said 
ms harris of mukwonago who posed nude for playboy magazine 
along with her twin sister met kritzik in december 1980 according 
to court documents 
she claims to have lived with kritzik from shortly after their 
meeting until the day after kritzik was beaten bound and gagged in 
his apartment a lawsuit drafted for the sisters but never filed 
said kritziks son stanley stepped between his father and the 
women that day 
the 22page lawsuit was prepared after kritzik ended his 
sevenyear relationship with the twins even though attorneys never 
filed the suit the government said it can be used against ms 
harris 
an internal revenue service investigator claims kritzik 
characterized as prostitution his relationship with the two women 
during an interview from a summer home in palm springs calif but 
the affidavit with statements from that interview was thrown out 
this morning 
the judge said he suspected that kritzik took the most expedient 
route not realizing he might place ms harris in a difficult 
position 
the court is of the position that mr kritzik found himself 
between the proverbial rock and a hard place curran said 
coffey had argued that kritzik may have been coerced into making 
the statement because the irs agent showed up unannounced to take 
the affidavit coffey argued that the statement was untrustwothy 
kritzik had told authorities he bought houses for each woman and 
gave them access to department store credit cards 
a federal grand jury indicted ms harris on two counts of tax 
evasion and two counts of failure to file tax returns ms conley 
was charged with four counts of failing to file federal income tax 
returns 
for more than five years the twins alternated nights with the 
widowed kritzik according to the unfiled lawsuit which the 
government introduced as evidence last month 
in public kritzik called the twins my girls and said they 
had nothing to worry about for the rest of their lives the 
government alleges 
kritzik founded general merchandise co in the 1930s which grew 
in its day to become the largest mail order company in the world 
he later created the treasure island discount store chain 
ms conley of suburban milwaukee has maintained that no sexual 
relationship existed between her and kritzik 
in the unfiled lawsuit the twins claimed they were entitled to 
damages for breach of contract fraud and slander 
ms harris claims to have given up a film career to be with 
kritzik and said ms conley lost earning potential when their act 
broke up the twins who grew up in milwaukee as the moga sisters 
appeared nude together in two films i the jury and 
sorceress 
ms harris filed a slander lawsuit in june 1989 against stanley 
kritzik claiming he destroyed her relationship with his father by 
calling her a drug addict prostitute and thief 
another suit filed in probate court seeks 5 million from 
kritziks estate in 1986 they claim kritzik told them they would 
each receive 5 million after his death 
if convicted ms harris faces 12 years in prison and 625000 
in fines if the payments were gifts kritzik would have been 
responsible for gift taxes which he never paid

subcommittee reported monday 
most cases of elder abuse go unreported because older people are 
ashamed to admit their families abuse them or they fear reprisals 
if they complain the aging subcommittee on health and longterm 
care reported 
elder abuse has been virtually ignored by the federal 
government even in the face of mounting evidence of its scope and 
severity the report said without meaningful federal support 
to prevent detect and treat it elder abuse remains a national 
disgrace 
the incidence of such abuse has increased from about 1 million 
victims annually in 1980 to 15 million or 5 percent of all older 
americans the panel said only about one of every eight cases is 
reported down from the one in five cases reported in 1980 
the subcommittee said its survey of states and social workers 
found thousands of accounts of abuse ranging from systematic theft 
of social security checks to violent physical abuse including rape 
and murder 
forty states reported that the problem continues to worsen 
sadly at a time when the incidence of elder abuse is on the 
rise the congress and the states are doing less said rep 
edward r roybal dcalif chairman of the subcommittee and the 
full select committee aging on aging 
the subcommittees report illustrated with photos of abused 
older people detailed cases in which adult children kicked and hit 
their parents attacked them with knitting needles and knives 
stole their cars denied them food and neglected other basic needs 
it said physical violence and financial abuse were the most 
common types of abuse followed by the denial of basic human rights 
and psychological abuse 
victims are likely to be 75 or older and are more likely to be 
women than men the abusers most often are adult children 
typically a son and frequently were themselves abused by their 
parents when they were young the report said 
among the examples cited in the report 
an elderly delaware woman weighing about 60 pounds was 
hospitalized with dehydration bloody drainage from her knees 
maggots covering her legs deep purple bruises and a black eye she 
said she lived with her daughter but refused to blame anyone 
saying i dont want to get anyone in trouble she died two 
weeks later 
in texas a 69yearold woman was found tied to her wheelchair 
with an electrical cord suffering from malnourishment insect 
bites and sores after being released from the hospital she died 
from extreme neglect while her daughter and friends drank in the 
next room 
the report was released one day in advance of a scheduled 
subcommittee hearing on elder abuse the hearing and report were 
designed to take stock of the situation a decade after the aging 
committee held its first hearing on elder abuse 
the subcommittee called for greater spending on federal programs 
to combat elder abuse and provide adult protective services it 
said congress also should consider legislation to provide federal 
funds to states that have mandatory abuse reporting laws and 
called for a national clearinghouse on elder abuse and a tollfree 
hotline to collect reports of abuse 
the subcommittee also advocated legislation to provide 
assistance to people who care at home for chronically ill or 
dependent family members

larry shamas downtown grocery store 
opened in 1876 the year wild bill hickok was gunned down while 
playing poker in this black hills gold rush town 
these days the food in shamas goldberg grocery is going to 
waste the crowds that throng main street are hungry only for the 
shuffle of cards and the ring of slot machines 
the growth of gambling has caught almost everyone in deadwood by 
surprise mayor bruce oberlander describes the growing pains as a 
combination of the good the bad and the ugly 
lowstakes gambling was legalized six months ago since then it 
has brought money and nearly 1000 jobs to a city whose population 
numbered about 2000 before the games began but its also changed 
the way of life and placed strains on the citys streets parking 
lots and water and sewer systems 
it leaves a person a little crazy but its very exciting 
said shama who installed slot machines alongside his food shelves 
and soda fountain after gambling was legalized 
anytime you have an economic boom in any industry there are 
some problems he added but i have more fun personally viewing 
this as a challenge not a problem 
the goldberg grocery will close for renovation this week 
becoming the latest in a string of hardware stores souvenir shops 
and other businesses to change or close when goldbergs opens 
again in july only the soda fountain will remain along with an 
expanded line of slot machines and card tables 
we are changing our style of business in order to survive and 
its nobodys fault shama said at first it was a hell of a 
decision then again by the same token i think everyone has to 
change because of survival 
the state gaming commission so far has approved gambling 
licenses for 50 businesses nearly 900 workers and six 
manufacturers of gaming equipment said don gromer executive 
secretary 
in the first five months of gambling players wagered more than 
74 million and the gambling halls kept more than 7 million after 
winnings were paid licensing fees and an 8 percent tax on the 
gambling halls proceeds have provided the city with 1 million 
the state with 164000 and lawrence county with 41000 gromer 
said 
i never figured wed have 50 businesses out there and i never 
figured wed have the amount of play we have he said 
the gambling which is limited to 5 a bet started as a project 
aimed at providing deadwood with money to restore its historic 
buildings the citys entire share of the proceeds must be used to 
renovate the buildings and city services such as water lines 
a statewide vote in 1988 approved a constitutional amendment 
allowing gaming in deadwood the south dakota legislature and city 
voters gave their consent last year 
bill walsh owner of the 86yearold franklin hotel said 
deadwoods gambling industry has grown swiftly because the town 
offers visitors a glimpse of the western frontier something that 
cannot be matched by the casinos of atlantic city nj 
the old west is alive with gambling with dancehall girls 
people drinking and smoking cigars and all the things weve 
outlawed its got to happen someplace walsh said 
before gambling deadwoods economy depended on summer tourists 
many of whom visited nearby mount rushmore national memorial and 
stopped off on their way to yellowstone national park and other 
attractions in the west in colder months deadwoods streets were 
virtually bare 
deadwood now has a chance to become a yearround destination 
walsh said 
but prosperity carries a price 
deadwood voters approved the gambling by a 75 percent margin a 
year ago far exceeding the 60 percent needed the mayor said hes 
not sure 60 percent of the citys voters would endorse gambling if 
the election were held now 
while the extra jobs and money are welcome some people dont 
like the change in the citys character oberlander said some have 
moved away because of their opposition to gambling meanwhile 
newcomers arive daily to work in the gambling halls 
gambling is a fact of life in deadwood now oberlander said 
were going to have to live with it were going to have to make 
it work to the best of our ability

militant shipyard workers whose 
occupation strike was broken up over the weekend fought more 
running battles with riot police today hurling rocks and 
firebombs and sympathy protests spread nationwide 
in the capital of seoul more than 2000 riot police stormed the 
headquarters of the korea broadcasting system late tonight and 
arrested about 400 workers to end prolonged protests 
as the police stormed the station workers locked arms and sang 
songs disunited we die they shouted some protested angrily 
but most walked out voluntarily and got on police buses 
it was the second time in three days the government has moved to 
put down labor protests with force 
the police action came a few hours after workers voted down a 
plan to end 19 days of protests which began april 12 workers were 
demanding the resignation of a new government appointed president 
suh kiwon who they said was against reform 
the operation of the networks three television channels and 
five radio stations continued throughout the protest but much of 
the regular programming was substituted with old tapes and music 
in ulsan workers wearing red headbands bearing the word 
fight set up roadblocks and burned tires sending clouds of 
thick smoke into the sky as they battled police throughout this 
industrial city 200 miles southeast of seoul 
police used tear gas to fight off about 2000 workers who 
charged in groups of 50 to 200 
two police helicopters hovered overhead apparently to monitor 
protesters movements and direct police operations on the ground 
all vehicles approaching the shipyard were stopped at a police 
checkpoint and searched 
elsewhere more workers and students joined sympathy protests 
against saturdays raid by about 13000 riot police on the 
strikebound hyundais shipyard the worlds largest to crush a 
threeday strike 
about 27000 workers of the hyundai motor co in ulsan the 
nations largest automaker began a twoday sympathy strike today 
and workers at several other hyundai subsidiaries in the city 
threatened to strike 
no overall casualty figures were provided for the three days of 
violence however weekend reports said at least 24 people were 
hurt and more than 600 detained 
the government has vowed to deal firmly with the turmoil saying 
it threatens the economy strikes steep wage increases and the 
rise of the national currency against the dollar have hurt the 
ability of south korean products to compete abroad 
the shipyard and the auto plant are the main arms of the giant 
hyundai group one of the largest conglomerates in south korea with 
48 billion in 1989 sales the group also makes computers steel 
and other goods 
in the southern city of taegu president roh taewoos hometown 
about 50 radical students shouting down with roh taewoo 
attacked the citys police headquarters with firebombs news 
reports said 
riot police firing tear gas overpowered five students who 
briefly occupied the top floor of the threestory building and a 
radio transmission tower inside the compound the reports said 
no one was injured but several cars parked inside the police 
headquarters were destroyed they said 
police in other industrial areas remained on full alert as many 
dissident labor unions called for a nationwide general strike on 
tuesday the may day labor holiday in support of the hyundai 
shipyard workers 
the national council of student representatives announced today 
it will step up antigovernment protests in the coming weeks 
leaders said they organized blitzkrieg squads to attack 
government offices 
the radical student group led violent antigovernment protests 
in seoul and other parts of the country over the weekend on

pipes guarded the main gate of their plant groups of 100 to 200 
riot police in combat gear were stationed at 300yard intervals 
along the road leading to the plant 
at the hyundai shipyard a few miles away about 50 militant 
workers were still holding out on top of a 240foot crane they had 
climbed up there during saturdays dawn police raid 
reports said the workers have enough food and water for at least 
two weeks 
police had spread nets and air mattresses around the base of the 
crane saying the workers may commit suicide in despair today the 
workers threw down a statement threatening to kill themselves 
the shipyard strike began wednesday over demands for the release 
of four union leaders jailed in earlier protests the company 
maintains judicial matters are out of its control 
labor leaders say the roh government is more repressive than 
past authoritarian regimes they also say it has unjustly jailed 
more than 200 union activists since taking office in 1988 
apparently affected by the escalating labor unrest share prices 
on the korea stock exchange dropped sharply today hitting their 
lowest level since october 1988 the composite index the main

attorneys for manuel noriega today filed a motion 
to withdraw from the case because the us government has frozen 
all their clients money 
there are millions of dollars in bank accounts that are 
frozen even though under the governments contention they are not 
subject to the forfeiture law said jon may one of noriegas 
four attorneys we are not asking for any funds that would be 
tainted 
may said the defense has received only a few thousand 
dollars for expenses since noriegas capture and nothing in fees 
he said the defense now needs money to travel take depositions 
and do research but lacks the resources because of the frozen bank 
accounts but the government is refusing to even negotiate he 
said 
the motion of the four lawyers to withdraw from the case was 
filed this morning may emphasized that withdrawal from the case is 
not automatic and must still be approved by us district judge 
william hoeveler 
may blamed the bush administration for the decision to freeze 
all of noriegas accounts rather than the us attorneys office 
in miami 
the government is spending 20 million to 30 million on their 
case said another defense attorney steven kollin we dont 
need anywhere near that amount but we may need 5 million to 
defend general noriega 
the us attorneys office which is prosecuting the case had no 
immediate reaction to the announcement 
the federal government has been freezing noriegas assets around 
the world as they are discovered an initial list following his 
capture found bank accounts and property worth about 30 million 
but the panamanian government has estimated noriegas fortune could 
be as high as 700 million 
noriega is currently jailed at the federal metropolitan 
correctional center southwest of miami on drug charges springing 
from a february 1988 indictment accusing him of accepting bribes to 
turn panama into a safe haven for colombias medellin drug cartel 
he surrendered to us authorities jan 4 two weeks after the 
united states invaded panama 
his trial is set for january 1991 and it was not clear whether 
a change in defense attorneys would set that date back kollin said 
he thought it would 
along with may and kollin noriegas attorneys are frank rubino 
and classified information specialist david lewis 
lewis was expected to play a key role in upcoming battles over 
reams of classified docutments the defense was requesting to 
bolster its contention that noriega was working closely with us 
authorities during the time he allegedly aided drug traffickers

seven months after hurricane hugo smashed 
into south carolina the flow of relief supplies has slowed to a 
trickle and the federal government has shuttered its disaster 
centers 
but mennonites are still helping 
farmers carpenters and professionals from such places as 
newton kan goshen ind and lancaster pa are giving their 
time and talents to help south carolinians recover from the states 
worst natural disaster in nearly a century 
were not here for the glory we get out of it were here 
because people need us said wilbur lentz coordinator of the 
mennonite disaster services relief effort one of the biggest 
blessings has been to see one of these poor people back in a house 
and to see that great big smile 
jesus said that if you see one of these people in need and 
dont do anything about it how can you say gods love is in you 
hugos 135 mph winds smashed ashore on sept 21 killing 29 
people and causing about 59 billion property damage 
after the storm up to 300 volunteers a week responded to calls 
by the mennonite church to help with cleanup and repairs 
that number has tapered off but about 100 mennonites continue 
to work each week lentz of akron pa said the operation will 
continue at least through years end 
a lot of our volunteers are farmers and tradesmen and they 
have their own jobs to attend to now said lentz an ordained 
minister and carpenter who has been in south carolina since fall 
officials estimate that perhaps 3000 mennonites have worked on 
storm recovery about one for every congregation in north america 
the denomination has about 325000 members whose beliefs include 
opposition to holding public office they also favor plain dress 
but unlike the amish who split from them in the 17th century 
mennonites accept reliance on some modern conveniences 
volunteers donate their time and provide their own 
transportation and donations are used to help feed and house them 
at disaster sites 
its very much a part of the faith of the mennonites said 
sandy weaver a spokeswoman for mennonite disaster service at the 
groups headquarters in akron near lancaster pa 
mennonites disaster efforts were as an outgrowth of world war 
ii as conscientious objectors they performed community service 
rather than fight afterward some wondered why they provided 
service just in wartime she said 
congregations in the midwest responded to disasters in the early 
1950s and the disaster service agency was established in 1955 
in south carolina the mennonites supply free labor and 
materials are either donated or provided through insurance money 
the most discouraging thing for me is deciding who you help 
and who you dont help said vic plessinger a volunteer from 
smithville ohio who has been here since march 
the group receives referrals from the american red cross and 
social service agencies helping those who lack the money to cover 
costs of repairs or rebuilding 
since hugo mennonites have repaired hundreds of roofs and 
rebuilt more than a dozen homes 
among the beneficiaries is juanita singleton whose house near 
pineville 30 miles north of charleston was destroyed 
its a godsend mrs singleton said of her new threebedroom 
house built by mennonites i cant even explain what its meant 
a few miles away in the hamlet of russellville arthur teives 
of newton kan is busy repairing another house 
teives who has been in south carolina five weeks said helping 
out has kind of been a way for me to serve god i feel this is 
where god wants me at this time in my life 
in nearby moncks corner work is progressing on a new house for 
william heyward he had put up the cinderblock foundation for a 
house next door but ran out of money 
instead of repairing his old house which was heavily damaged 
the mennonites proposed finishing the new one 
you dont know how much we appreciate it heyward said 
its really nice 
lentz said volunteers and building supplies are still needed 
although attention has turned away from hugo 
since the hurricane mennonites also have responded to the san 
francisco bayarea earthquake tornadoes in the midwest and 
flooding in alabama 
and if another disaster occurs he said well be there

the executive director of a charity has 
won a vote confidence from the board of trustees even though a 
millionaire had made her ouster a condition for a huge bequest 
and an official of the charity says the millionaires 
restrictive will may not have any effect 
leslie combs ii a horse breeder who died april 7 at age 88 
stipulated in his will that the ephraim mcdowell cancer research 
foundation be given an endowment worth an estimated 20 million 
over the next 25 years but only if it replaced linda mauk as 
director 
combs did not say why he wanted mauk fired 
but the trustees issued a statement friday saying they had 
unanimously voted an expression of confidence in the 
foundations management 
no further comments will be issued the board said 
and william bagby the foundations president issued a 
statement thursday saying a trust combs set up in 1986 contained 
provisions that overrode the wording of his last will 
bagby cited a portion of the trust agreement that says it is 
irrevocable and the grantor shall have no power to amend or alter 
this trust 
combs will said centre college and the cancer foundation would 
each be paid percentages ranging from 1 percent to 99 percent as 
determined by the trustees of the trust as long as mauk was 
director the foundation would receive little money the will 
stated 
bagby said the clause about mauk and varying percentages were 
amendments and alterations of the trust and contrary to his wishes 
stated in his trust that he cannot amend or alter the trust 
lawyer charles hembree who drafted combs will and is one of 
three trustees of the trust disagreed with bagbys opinion 
i dont think i want to comment other than to say i do not 
agree with his interpretation hembree said 
combs will said that if the foundation or anyone acting for 
it tried to change the will 100 percent of the annuity should go 
to centre college 
combs founder of spendthrift farm one of the major horse 
breeding establishments in the lexington area attended centre 
college in danville

the supreme court on monday killed an effort 
to strip the roman catholic church of its taxexempt status because 
of its antiabortion activities 
the justices let stand a ruling that abortion rights advocates 
lack the proper legal standing to sue the federal government for 
revocation of the churchs tax exemption 
the muchpublicized 1980 suit directed primarily at the 
government said the catholic church violates internal revenue 
service rules by lobbying against abortion rights and contributing 
to political candidates who oppose abortion 
in other action the court 
gave state governments and consumers a potential pocketbook 
victory by ruling unanimously in a california case that they may 
use federal antitrust law to break up corporate mergers 
let the government force thousands of transportation department 
employees to take random drug tests the court without comment 
rejected arguments that such tests violate privacy rights 
left intact a delaware courts ruling that the public has no 
constitutional right to know the names of jurors while they are 
serving in a criminal trial 
ruled unanimously that the port authority of new york and new 
jersey may be sued in federal court 
ordered more study in a dispute over the use of certain 
evidence in the trial of nine puerto rico men accused of robbing 
72 million from a wells fargo depot in west hartford conn 
seven years ago 
the lawsuit attacking the catholic churchs antiabortion role 
contended that the irs by failing to enforce its rules has 
granted the church the equivalent of a cash subsidy for partisan 
political activity 
the irs generally bars taxexempt groups from engaging in 
lobbying and contributing to political candidates 
some of the abortion rights groups have the same taxexempt 
status as the church but their lawyers said the groups refrain 
from lobbying and making political contributions and thus suffer 
a competitive disadvantage in the national debate over abortion 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals voting 21 threw out the 
suit last september saying the fact that abortion rights advocates 
refrain from such activities is precisely why they lack legal 
standing 
the justices previously had studied a different aspect of the 
case in 1988 they voted 81 to free the church from having to pay 
100000 a day in court fines for withholding documents sought by 
the abortion rights advocates

the average salary of classroom teachers will 
pass the 30000 mark for the first time this year but the gap in 
teachers pay among states is still huge the national education 
association said monday 
the nea figures taken from estimates of school statistics 
198990 and slated to be published later this month showed that 
the average teacher salary across the country rose to 31304 for 
the 198990 school year that is 59 percent higher in current 
dollars than the previous years revised figure of 29547 
alaska had the highest state salary average with 43153 while 
south dakota showed the lowest at 21300 more than a 100 percent 
gap the dollar gap has grown from 15360 in 197980 to 21853 in 
198990 
nea president keith geiger said he is disturbed by the average 
wage level and the unevenness of the school finance picture 
across the country 
while teacher salaries climbed past the 30000 mark for the 
first time this is still not an adequate wage for the professional 
services teachers perform said geiger he said more than half of 
all teachers hold a masters degree or a sixyear diploma 
teachers also have an average of 15 years in the classroom he 
said 
according to the study the current dollar increases in salary 
over the years since 196970 appear substantial from 8626 in 
196970 to the current 31304 estimate an increase of 22678 in 
unadjusted terms when the effects of price inflation are taken 
into account the nea said the average teacher salary grows by only 
1521 or 83 percent over the period 
besides alaska other states with the highest salaries are 
connecticut at 40496 california at 38996 and new york at 
38800 other states with the lowest salaries are arkansas 
22009 west virginia 22842 and louisiana 22993 
geiger stressed the need for equity and said that goal 
requires that additional financial resources be distributed so as 
to even out access to educational opportunity among school 
districts and states 
the nea reported average teacher salaries for each state and the 
district of columbia from highest to lowest as follows 
alaska 43153 connecticut 40496 california 38996 new 
york 38800 washington dc 36450 maryland 36092 rhode

president bush told panamas new leader today 
that the united states will stand with you in peace but said 
he was embarassed by congressional delay on a 800 million aid 
request for panama and nicaragua 
bush chastized congress for not moving quicker on his aid 
package after a white house meeting with president guillermo endara 
ive asked and asked again that our aid package to the newly 
liberated people of panama be passed and passed swiftly and still 
it waits bush said in joint remarks with endara at the 
conclusion of their meeting 
it is time to finish the job just as you cant cross a chasm 
in two small steps the people of panama cant hope to make the 
leap to liberty and prosperity with only halfhearted support from 
her neighbors to the north bushs said 
bush and endara also signed four agreements three on drugwar 
cooperation and the fourth allowing peace corps volunteers to 
return to panama 
panama a nation newly reborn in liberty can count on the 
support of the united states of america we were with you in times 
of conflict and we will stand with you in peace bush said 
endara speaking in spanish thanked bush for the us role in 
restoring democracy and freedom to panama then switching to 
english endara told the president the people of panama will 
always be grateful for the support and friendship of the american 
people and for the sunshine of freedom we currently enjoy 
he invited bush to come to panama as soon as possible 
be careful i might just show up bush said 
endara making his first visit to the united states was 
installed as president under us auspices four months ago as the 
american invasion of panama was getting underway 
before the meeting bush addressed the us chamber of commerce 
and called anew for congress to approve emergency aid for nicaragua 
and panama the panamanian portion amounts to 420 million 
it is embarrassing bush said noting that his request was 
still pending even as endara made his first visit as president to 
washington 
it is frustrating to see the congress delaying its work 
bush said noting that he had submitted his aid request on march 13 
and asked that it be approved by april 5 
nicaragua and panama quite simply need this aid and weve got 
to deliver the president said 
one of the accords signed by endara and bush would allow the 
us military to board panamanianflag vessels suspected of 
carrying narcotics 
another seeks to regulate chemical substances used for illicit 
drugs and the third agreement would permit the us coast guard to 
enter panamanian territorial waters under specified circumstances 
a senior state department official drew a sharp contrast between 
current conditions in panama and those which prevailed a year ago 
when gen manuel antonio noriega was still firmly in charge and 
refused to recognize endaras victory in the may 1989 presidential 
elections 
the noriegacontrolled electoral tribunal threw out the results 
creating a constitutional crisis 
the us official who asked not to be identified said endaras 
legitimacy is increasingly recognized both in panama and 
internationally even though he assumed his duties as a direct 
result of military intervention 
noriega is awaiting trial in florida on drug trafficking 
charges the military establishment he headed for six years has 
been stripped of its noriega loyalists and is now under civilian 
authority force levels have been reduced from 16000 to 10000 and 
panama can look to a more democratic future 
the official said most economic indicators including private 
investment levels suggest the country is on the way to recovery 
after a long period of decline 
other officials however said unemployment levels are 
dangerously high creating the possibility of renewed unrest 
endara at a stop sunday in miami on his way to washington 
suggested the rebuilding nation may need more than the 420 million 
in aid that is awaiting approval by congress 
panama must be supported by the rest of the world as a living 
example for the nations that suffer under infamous dictatorships 
he said 
an endara adviser who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
endaras government had requested 1 billion towards its recovery 
during his fiveday trip to washington and new york endara will 
also meet with officials from the international monetary fund the 
world bank and the interamerican development bank

the united states and the leftist government 
of south yemen resumed diplomatic relations monday after a break of 
nearly 21 years 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler expressed 
satisfaction over the move and said the united states seeks a 
useful productive relationship 
south yemen has had close ties with the soviet union and is the 
only arab nation that has pursued marxist policies it also has 
been accused by the united states of engaging in statesponsored 
terrorism 
responding to questions ms tutwiler said south yemen has been 
intent on maintaining peaceful relations with its arabian peninsula 
neighbors and has begun liberalizing its economy and its political 
system 
its record on terrorism also has improved she said 
we hope to see continued good relations among the countries in 
that area contributing to regional stability and further economic 
progress she said 
south yemen continues to be on a us list of countries that 
engage in international terrorism because terrorist organizations 
have been allowed to maintain facilities there and south yemeni 
officials have provided refuge for airline hijackers she said 
a new state department report on terrorism made public monday 
asserts that south yemen has considerably reduced its support for 
terrorism since the early 1980s no terrorist incidents were traced 
to south yemen by the state department last year 
ms tutwiler said the issue of diplomatic relations is an 
entirely separate matter from a countrys record on terrorism 
talks on normalizing relations have been held in recent months 
by us and south yemeni officials based at the united nations 
south yemen broke diplomatic relations with washington in 1969 
alleging us involvement in subversive activities a decade ago 
the united states provided military aid to north yemen at a time of 
military conflict between the two arabian peninsula neighbors 
lately however the two yemens have been making plans for a 
merger and have set a nov 30 target date in addition the soviet 
union has been reducing its once extensive ties to south yemen 
mondays announcement trims by one the small number of countries 
worldwide with which the united states does not have diplomatic 
relations last week the state department said it was ready to 
pursue normal relations with albania after a break of more than 50 
years

golden tans have been big business 
in this desert oasis for decades now its official 
to obtain an official palm springs tan sun worshipers will have 
to baste themselves with the only line of browning balms bearing 
city approval 
starting in may bottles of palm springs desertan lotions will 
have a small tag with the sun setting over a cluster of palm trees 
certifying it is an officially licensed product of the city of 
palm springs 
competing for precious tourist dollars city leaders value the 
name recognition benefits of the endorsement deal 
licensing is a double plus for the city said councilman 
tuck broich it gets our name out in a lot of new ways and it 
generates revenue for the city 
proposals for palm springs gourmet potato chips towels 
clothing dishware sheets and a board game called palm 
springsopoly also are in the works officials said 
but celebrity mayor sonny bono does not plant to plug the 
desertan products marketed by greg ackerman 
thats not part of the deal bono said ive got to draw 
the line somewhere or pretty soon someone will want me to promote 
something else and then something else and it would just get out of 
hand 
councilman earl neel said the licensing deal may generate only 
about 2000 a year but hoped it could launch a trend of 
endorsements 
broich acknowledged no one on the council had given desertan 
products the poolside test saying i dont have time to go out 
and lie in the sun 
but he said the council insisted that ackerman carry insurance 
in case lawsuits were filed against the city by sunbathers unhappy 
with his products

native st petersburg resident or was brought from out of state

americans saving rate rose to 58 percent of 
their disposable income in march as consumer spending failed to 
match the increase in personal incomes the government reported 
monday 
but analysts cited rising prices for the subdued spending and 
not consumer intent to increase their savings rate 
for each of the months of the first quarter we had very 
strong inflation that cut into purchasing power said david 
berson chief economist for the federal national mortgage 
association its likely to see that reverse itself in the second 
quarter 
stephen s roach senior economist at morgan stanley amp co in 
new york agreed saying inflation remains the single biggest 
threat to the consumer support of this expansion although he too 
expects it to moderate in the current quarter 
that will enable consumers to continue to expand their 
capacity to spend he said 
consumer spending is watched closely as a barometer of economic 
health because it accounts for about twothirds of the nations 
economic activity it has been in the forefront of the economic 
expansion now in its eighth year following the 198182 recession 
consumer spending totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
366 trillion slowing to a 04 percent gain after a 06 percent 
advance in february the commerce department reported it was the 
lowest since a 03 percent increase in october 
the department said personal incomes grew 08 percent to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 467 trillion on top of 08 
percent jumps in both january and february the increases 
originally were reported to have been 07 percent in january and 
09 percent in february 
the march and february increases in personal income were 
boosted by increases in subsidy payments to farm proprietors the 
department said excluding these payments personal income 
increases 246 billion or 05 percent in march and 289 
billion or 06 percent in february 
americans income after taxes rose 08 percent in march the 
largest increase since an 09 percent gain in december the 
department said 
the key component of the income category wages and salaries 
rose 141 billion at an annual rate after a 22 billion gain in 
february 
the increase in personal consumption which includes everything 
except interest payments on debt totaled 138 billion down from 
213 billion in february 
purchases of durable goods bigticket items expected to last 
more than three years fell 68 billion purchases of nondurable 
goods also fell down 25 billion while services gained 231

we cannot rest until all hostages are free 
he called the news of reeds release by kidnappers in lebanon 
cause for joy but expressed concern about the plight of six other 
americans and 10 other westerners who remain hostage 
this is a joyous day for mr reed his family his friends and 
all americans bush said in a written statement 
with mr reeds release we have six innocent americans that 
are still being held hostage in lebanon as well as the other 
foreign hostages he said their predicament weighs on our mind 
and tempers the joy we feel today 
as he did eight days ago when hostage robert polhill was let go 
bush thanked syria and iran two states the united states has 
accused in the past of sponsoring terrorism 
once again we wish to express our gratitude to all those who 
through their efforts helped in mr reeds release said bush 
in particular we would like to thank the government of syria for 
facilitating this release we would also like to thank the 
government of iran for using its influence to help bring about this 
humanitarian step 
bush was meeting later this afternoon at the white house with 
polhill the railthin educator still recuperating from his 39 
months in captivity 
bush said we cannot rest however until all hostages are 
free we urge all parties who either hold hostages or have any 
influence over the hostage takers to work for the expeditious and 
unconditional release of the remaining hostages 
earlier the bush administration today dispatched a special 
recovery team to west germany to greet reed 
there was no immediate word from state department officials on 
reeds condition after 43 months in captivity 
in malden mass reeds wife fahima said she was ready to 
travel overseas as soon as i see the picture of my husband 
reed was the second american hostage released in a little more 
than a week robert polhill was freed by his captors on april 22 
and returned to the united states late last week 
reeds release left six americans still hostage in the middle 
east including terry anderson of the associated press he is the 
longest held and has been captive for more than five years 
earlier in the day as optimism rose over the prospect of a 
release the white house said it was very hopeful that a 
hostage would be freed but it it reiterated its policy of no deals 
with the kidnappers 
reed a hostage in lebanon for 43 months was liberated by 
islamic militants and turned over to syria which played a 
middleman role for the bush administration the state department 
said in the first word of his release 
weve got confirmation that hes been released and is in 
syrian hands in lebanon said kim hoggard a state department 
spokeswoman after receiving word from the us embassy in damascus 
the state department had kept an open telephone line to the 
embassy in the expectation that reed former director of the 
lebanon international school in beirut would be liberated 
reed was seized in the lebanese capital sept 9 1986 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater aid the state department 
hostage reception team was being dispatched to wiesbaden west 
germany where hostage reed will be taken for treatment 
amid reports in iran that the planned release follows 
extensive talks between the iranian government and the 
hostageholders fitzwater said weve had a lot of third party 
intermediary kinds of messages back and forth with iran but 
theres nothing we can point to in terms of any specific reasons 
for this release 
it is virtually impossible for us to know exactly the 
contributions of iran in these kinds of matter the spokesman 
added 
he reiterated that there will be no deals with the 
kidnappers 
we know very little about the islamic revolutionary dawn 
the group saying it would release reed fitzwater said 
at the state department ms tutwiler said the islamic dawn 
group was unknown to us before yesterdays announcement ms 
tutwiler said it is probably associated with the islamic jihad but 
added we know next to nothing about this group 
no one knows precisely what motivates the hostagetakers in 
any of their activities either in the taking of hostages or 
holding them or releasing them fitzwater said there is 
considerable speculation that iran and syria and others in that 
part of the world would like to have better relations with the 
united states the president has said goodwill begets goodwill and 
we are hopeful that indeed that is the case that they do want 
better relations 
reed 57 was director of the lebanese international school when 
he was seized from his chauffeurdriven car near the beirut airport 
on sept 12 1986 as he was driven to play golf 
the massachusetts native had lived in beirut for eight years he

while the reed family waited to see if that statement would come 
true reeds 91yearold mother leota sprague said she had never 
lost faith that her son would be free one day 
i havent been able to cry for four years mrs sprague 
said now i can smile and say thank god 
we have to keep faith she said but added a word of 
caution its an awful thrust in your side when you find out 
these things arent true 
when she first heard of the kidnappers communique mrs reed 
jumped up and down and hugged friends and relatives 
oh my god no she shouted im going to die i dont 
believe this 
mrs reed was born in syria her husband converted to islam to 
marry her she said her sister in damascus would try to meet him in 
the middle east and she planned to travel to wiesbaden west 
germany to meet him there 
shown a photograph the kidnappers sent along with the statement 
sunday mrs reed said her husband looked much thinner and much 
older 
i hope hell be ok she said her voice wavering but how 
can you be completely ok when youve been chained and blindfolded 
so long hell need lots of love and affection he used to say 
lets have some tender loving care hell need that when he gets 
out 
mrs reed said she had a premonition after hostage robert 
polhills release on april 22 that her husband would be freed next 
but i pushed that to the back of my mind she said i 
dont want to be too optimistic id rather be surprised 
last year their 9yearold son tarek wrote president bush 
asking for help in freeing his father the boys thirdgrade 
classmates wrote similar letters and in march he received a 
response from the president advising him to stay strong 
when bush was asked about sundays report he declined to 
comment except to say if that proves to be true thats 
wonderful 
marilyn langston 33 one of reeds two daughters from a 
previous marriage expressed concern about her fathers health 
noting reports that said reed tried to escape and was beaten 
severely it really depends on how they were treated she said 
if you think about being held almost four years without any 
contacts from the outside world theres got to be something youll 
have to go through 
reed made two trips to lebanon before leaving his post as school 
principal in whitefield nh to become director of elementary 
education at beiruts international college in 1977 
at the time of his abduction on sept 9 1986 he was running 
the private lebanese international school which he founded after 
his former school the international college was bombed out 
after his abduction a caller to a western news agency claimed 
the american was a cia spy and was taken hostage by islamic jihad 
that shiite fundamentalist organization denied holding him and 
other callers claimed responsibility in the name of the moslem 
fundamentalist hezbollah and the littleknown resurrection cells 
reeds family called the espionage charge ridiculous

manuel noriegas attorneys on monday filed a motion 
to withdraw from the case saying the government was trying to 
sabotage the defense by freezing the ousted panamanian leaders 
money 
trying a penniless noriega is like shooting fish in a 
barrel lead defense attorney frank rubino said the only thing 
the general owns at this time is essentially the clothes on his 
back 
us district judge william hoeveler set a meeting wednesday 
with federal prosecutors to discuss the issue rubino said he 
expected a hearing by the end of the week if the judge grants the 
motion that could delay the april 1991 trial 
prosecutors refused to comment on details of the motion but 
us attorney dexter lehtinen issued a statement defending the 
seizures 
nothing the government has done regarding illegally obtained 
assets has infringed on noriegas rights in any way lehtinen 
said 
the government has been freezing noriegas assets around the 
world as they are discovered an initial list following his capture 
showed bank accounts and property worth about 30 million but the 
panamanian government has estimated noriegas fortune could be 700 
million 
the withdrawal motion said the government continued to freeze 
noriegas assets even when there was no reason to suspect they were 
drugrelated and had spurned defense requests to negotiate a 
solution 
the bush administration would very much like this case 
disposed of without a trial the motion said we have no doubt 
that the administrations refusal to negotiate over legal fees is 
in part motivated by its belief that without experienced counsel 
and adequate resources the general will decide to fold 
rubino said noriega had been gainfully employed for 25 years in 
the panamanian military and as leader of his country and owned 
several businesses he said it was ludicrous for the government 
to say noriega had no legal assets 
defense attorney say they have received only a few thousand 
dollars from private sources for expenses since noriegas capture 
and nothing for their fees rubino said he needs 20000 a month 
just to cover office expenses and because of the complexity of the 
drugsmuggling trial cannot handle other cases 
the court could order the defense to continue but the fixed 
40perhour rate would not pay even minimal costs he said 
the motion said the defense needs money to travel take 
depositions and do research but lacks the resources because of 
the frozen accounts the defense wants to hire more attorneys and 
secretaries and needs a team of investigators to go through a 
warehouse of documents in panama rubino said 
the government is spending 20 million to 30 million on their 
case said steven kollin another defense attorney we dont 
need anywhere near that amount but we may need 5 million to 
defend general noriega 
he emphasized that the defense is not asking for money the us 
government claims is drugrelated and subject to forfeiture laws 
rubino said fees in seizure cases usually are negotiated 
informally by the prosecution and defense but on friday the 
prosecutors office formally rejected any deal on the fees or 
expenses 
they noted that the issue according to the us attorneys 
office had been forwarded to washington after the defense 
requested negotiations two weeks ago 
noriega is jailed at the federal metropolitan correctional 
center on charges springing from a february 1988 indictment 
accusing him of accepting bribes to turn panama into a safe haven 
for colombias medellin drug cartel 
he surrendered to us authorities jan 4 two weeks after the 
united states invaded panama 
the trial had been set for january 1991 but was recently reset 
for april 1991 the attorneys said monday kollin cautioned 
however that if the defense team withdraws that date is likely to 
be set back further

high mortgage interest rates continued to 
hammer new home sales in march driving them down 5 percent in the 
fourth consecutive monthly decline the government said monday 
were getting killed by high interest rates said richard 
peach deputy chief economist for the mortgage bankers of america 
david berson chief economist for the federal national mortgage 
association agreed saying that as long as they rates stay up 
the housing market is going to be slow 
its not a recession pace berson said but its clearly 
not a boom period for housing either 
the commerce department said new singlefamily homes were sold 
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 574000 units in march 
after dropping a revised 15 percent in february sales originally 
were reported to have risen 31 percent in february 
the march level of sales was the lowest since an annual rate of 
556000 units a year earlier sales began to pick up in mid1989 as 
mortgage interest rates declined peaking at 741000 units in july 
but rates returned to their doubledigit level in january and 
ranged between 1022 percent and 1034 percent in march according 
to a survey by the federal home loan mortgage corp 
the national association of realtors also blamed high rates for 
flat sales of existing homes in march they were unchanged from 
februarys seasonally adjusted annual rate of 34 million units 
rates have continued to rise this month reaching 1056 percent 
friday their highest level since averaging 1061 percent in may 
according to the freddie mac survey 
the outlook for rates is not particularly positive said 
robert villanueva director of forecasting for the national 
association of home builders 
we had hoped that as we got into the summer building season 
that interest rates would begin to drop he said but theres 
so many factors suggesting that rates will stay up that thats 
probably a forlorn hope 
but while rates were rising the median price of new homes was 
falling down 14 percent to 123200 the median price means that 
half of the homes cost more half less on the other hand the 
average price of a new home rose 07 percent to 150300 
sales in the south led the march decline down 148 percent to 
219000 units they were off 134 percent in the west to 161000 
units 
but in the northeast where housing has been in the doldrums 
sales rose 338 percent to 99000 units they also were up in the 
midwest 92 percent to 95000 units 
berson said both increases were rebounds from the fourth coldest 
december on record he said it takes an average of seven weeks 
between the time buyers start looking at homes to the time they 
sign a purchase contract 
on the other hand sales in the south and west were not as 
adversely affected by the winter weather and more closely followed 
the movement in interest rates he said 
for the first three months of 1990 sales have fallen 5 percent 
to an annual rate of 153000 homes

the reagan administrations department of 
housing and urban development was a domestic political machine 
under samuel r pierce jr handing out grants to the well 
connected a former hud official later convicted of bribery told a 
house subcommittee monday 
dubois l gilliam a former deputy assistant secretary under 
pierce disputed the former housing secretarys assertion that he 
didnt decide who got federal grants pierce himself ordered 
federal grants in some cases gilliam said 
he linked the reagan white house to the hud controversy in at 
least one specific instance saying the administration ordered 
federal money for a new mexico project that had encountered 
problems 
we dealt strictly with politics he told the panel that has 
spent more than a year investigating allegations of fraud 
mismanagement influence peddling and political favoritism at hud 
during the period i was there the department of housing 
and urban development was the best domestic political machine i 
have ever seen gilliam said 
gilliams testimony was the first the panel has heard from a 
former top hud insider about pierces eight years as secretary 
pierces lawyers who attended the hearing dismissed gilliams 
testimony as lacking credibility 
attorney paul perito called the testimony a sordid menu from 
an admitted felon he said gilliam never accused pierce of 
violating the law and that gilliam was testifying in an effort to 
win early release from prison 
pierce testified before the panel last may later invoking his 
fifth amendment right against selfincrimination to avoid further 
testimony three former top aides also refused to testify 
gilliam is serving an 18month prison sentence after pleading 
guilty to accepting gratuities and conspiracy to defraud the 
government for abuse of hud programs 
testifying under a courtordered grant of immunity he described 
receiving as much as 100000 in clothes money travel and other 
gratuities from developers and consultants 
gilliam said he did not believe pierce ever took any illegal 
gratuities 
subcommittee chairman tom lantos dcalif called gilliam the 
key missing piece in the jigsaw puzzle 
gilliams testimony about the urban development action grant 
program raised new allegations about a program under which grants 
were to be based on numerical formulas he said hud under pierce 
considered who outside the agency supported projects when deciding 
which ones got money 
lantos asked gilliam if he would agree with statements pierce 
made in a september magazine interview and to his committee in may 
1989 saying he never told his top assistants to fund particular 
projects by developers seeking hud grants 
i know for a fact the secretary made decisions on hud 
grants gilliam said 
he said deborah gore dean once pierces executive assistant 
would not allow approval of discretionary grants without first 
clearing it with him dean also has refused to testify before the 
hose government operations subcommittee on employment and housing 
gilliam said pierce took a direct role in a proposed udag 
project at hampton institute a predominantly black college in 
virginia 
he told me he wanted me to assist them and he wanted it 
funded gilliam said referring to pierce 
gilliam said that order came despite the lack of an application 
or financing for the project pierce later removed himself from the 
hampton decision at the suggestion of the hud general counsel 
because of his ties to the school gilliam said 
the project was way down the road toward approval at that 
time gilliam said 
gilliam also testified that dean told him carol crawford 
associate director of the white houses budget office ordered a 
udag grant go to an albuquerque project in 1987 he said dean 
learned that sen pete domenici rnm had appealed to howard 
baker then the white house chief of staff for help on the project 
in another case gilliam said pierce took a direct role in 
ordering the transfer to another job of a career hud employee 
david sowell he said sowell had raised questions about the 
financial commitment offered on a proposed udag project by lance 
wilson a former top aide to pierce who was then working for a wall 
street investment firm 
gilliam said he suggested the transfer and pierce ordered it 
after he expressed concern that sowell was calling the department 
inspector generals fraud hotline number he said wilson after 
leaving hud was providing letters of financial commitment to get 
projects past application hurdles when the intent was that the 
project would obtain other financing later 
gilliam agreed with lantos description of wilsons financial 
commitment as fraudulent 
pierce also acted to block grants for those in his disfavor 
gilliam said citing a longrunning feud between pierce and rep 
henry b gonzalez dtexas 
gilliam said that when pierce learned that gonzalez wanted a san 
antonio project the hud secretary rejected it 
gilliams testimony was to continue wednesday and friday

here is the text of a commentary to be 
published tuesday in the englishlanguage tehran times on the 
hostage issue the editorial was made available to the associated 
press in advance 
by releasing a second american hostage lebanese moslem groups 
proved their good will to the united states and the western 
countries 
release of the two american hostages without any preconditions 
and solely for humanitarian and islamic causes was an extreme 
gesture of good will and selfsacrifice by lebanese moslem groups 
this important and major step showed that lebanese moslem groups 
are fully prepared for the resolution of the hostage crisis in the 
shortest possible time they proved this readiness in practice 
from the viewpoint of the islamic republic of iran which put in 
months of hard effort something miraculous has happened 
the us reaction after the release of the first us hostage 
was not likeable and it was also very unexpected the us house 
of representatives in an ugly move declared jerusalem as israels 
capital 
president bush declared he will show no good will until the 
release of all the hostages proisraeli and prowestern groups 
released only four lebanese moslems from the hundreds of hostages 
they hold 
such moves were distantly hostile and also insufficient for 
creation of a serious humanitarian move moreover the barbaric 
attacks of the occupier regime of israel increased in the past week 
after the release of the first hostage 
these actions in response to the lebanese moslem groups 
humanitarian move showed that the us and other western countries 
are not seriously determined to solve the hostage issue 
with respect to these actions the lebanese moslem groups were 
seriously doubtful about releasing a second hostage thus 
endangering the entire effort of the islamic republic 
in order to pave the way for the release of all the hostages and 
to give the us and the west a second opportunity so that they can 
give an appropriate response and show mutual good will the islamic 
republic insisted the lebanese groups release a second hostage 
fortunately with the unconditional release of a second hostage 
the extreme good will of the lebanese moslem groups and the islamic 
republic of iran was proved to the world 
now the ball is in the court of the us and the western 
countries 
through a mutual show of good will they can pressure israel and 
prowestern groups to release lebanese prisoners and hostages thus 
giving fresh life to the moves started by the islamic republic 
causing the release of the hostages to continue 
the islamic republic used its maximum power and credibility for 
the release of the hostages 
naturally without an appropriate response from the west there 
is no chance for the continuation of iranian mediation and requests 
release of only four lebanese from among hundreds of hostages 
and prisoners is nothing it would be appropriate if as the next 
step a significant number of hostages including a few iranian 
hostages and sheik obeid be released so that we can celebrate the 
year 1990 as the end of the hostage crisis

an economic austerity program 
decreed six weeks ago has brought massive layoffs and tuesdays 
may day holiday is no cause for celebration among brazilian 
unionists 
the economic situation has us with our backs against the 
wall said gilmar carneiro a union leader in sao paulo the 
nations largest city 
the austerity plan was announced by president fernando collor de 
mello on march 16 one day after he took office it included 
spending cuts the sale of state companies and firing of 
government workers it also froze 115 billion in savings accounts 
and money market deposits for 18 months 
the measures which collor said were necessary to combat annual 
inflation of nearly 5000 percent have drastically cut the cost of 
living but the economy appears headed for a steep recession 
an estimated 300000 workers have already been fired nationwide 
and about 700000 more were put on collective holiday on friday 
1470 metalworkers were laid off by three sao paulo firms 
after giving workers a pay increase in march of 73 percent 10 
percent less than the months inflation the government froze 
wages in april labor and independent groups estimate inflation was 
at least 24 percent in april 
the interunion department of statistics and socioeconomic 
studies a respected labor research group said this months 
minimum wage will be worth only 50 its lowest level since being 
created in 1940 
many brazilians support collors efforts against inflation but 
unions say workers are paying too high a price 
despite their opposition no major strikes have been declared 
since march 16 and labor leaders say workers are so fearful of 
losing their jobs that unions are unable to act 
before if paychecks were even a day late there were strikers 
at factory gates carlos aparicio clemente secretarygeneral of 
the metalworkers union in osasco sao paulo told the major 
newsweekly isto e important conquests by workers are being lost 
overnight 
strikes now would be stupidity our priority is the 
maintenance of jobs said jair meneguelli president of the 
leftist workers central union the countrys largest labor 
federation representing 12 million workers 
unions which represent about a third of brazils 65 
millionstrong workforce are even having a hard time preventing 
workers from accepting salary cuts as some businesses have 
demanded 
we are against making concessions to the bosses said 
carneiro when companies are making profits they never want to 
share the gains 
but about 30 salary reduction pacts have already been signed in 
the past month compared with a total of only five such deals 
during the countrys last recession between 1981 and 1983 
many union leaders say companies are using the economic turmoil 
as a smokescreen 
the mentality of businessmen is to take advantage of 
shortterm difficulties said luis antonio medeiros president of 
the sao paulo metalworkers union 
but business leaders say wage cuts are the only way to prevent 
wider layoffs as sales and revenues have plunged 
our sector is not going to return to the same level of 
production of before march 16 said domicio dos santos junior of 
the national sindicate of automobile manufacturers reducing the 
work week and salaries is an attempt to minimize the effects of 
unemployment

jurors in imelda marcos fraud trial were told 
monday about 1 million in newlyminted philippine pesos and 
jewelry that were seized after the marcoses fled to hawaii 
twentytwo boxes of currency and jewelry including a diamond 
tiara were on a us air force plane that followed the marcoses to 
this country on feb 26 1986 the day after ferdinand marcos was 
ousted as president us customs agent leslie e kinney said 
kinney returned to the stand after his testimony was interrupted 
thursday when mrs marcos 60 became ill from high blood pressure 
on monday mrs marcos was hooked up to a portable blood 
pressure monitor that beeped intermittently during kinneys 
testimony 
mrs marcos is accused of helping her husband steal more than 
220 million from the philippine treasury to buy manhattan real 
estate and art 
she has pleaded innocent to charges of racketeering 
racketeering conspiracy mail fraud and obstruction of justice 
marcos who also had been charged died last september in hawaii 
her codefendant saudi businessman adnan khashoggi is charged 
with mail fraud and obstruction of justice for allegedly helping 
the marcoses conceal their ownership of four manhattan buildings 
kinney identified four suitcases and a cardboard box which he 
said were among the 300 to 400 pieces of luggage that came with the 
marcos entourage to hickam air force base in honolulu 
he said the box was one of 22 that contained a total of 27 
million pesos he described the majority of the currency whose 
value in 1986 was 14 million as being in mint condition and 
consecutively numbered 
kinney also testified that jewelry was found in two suitcases 
one containing an embossed card with mrs marcos name on it and 
the other had an invitation addressed to mrs marcos tucked inside 
although jurors did not see the contents kinney identified 
seven pieces of jewelry including two tiaras necklaces and 
brooches from photographs entered into evidence 
the other suitcases were a battered aluminum case that kinney 
said was filled with financial documents and a designer case 
marked properties new york he said the latter held marcos 
business documents and certificates of bearer stock 
kinney said the pesos jewelry documents and stock certificates 
were first stored in an underground ammunition bunker at hickam 
and later moved to a customs vault in honolulu most of the other 
luggage was returned 
during crossexamination mrs marcos lawyer gerry spence 
presented customs declaration forms that had been filed on behalf 
of the marcoses in february and march 1986 
the forms reported more than 15 million pesos the stock 
certificates 315000 in us currency and 24 gold bars which 
were worth about 286000 in 1986 
spence also read from an attachment to the forms that said 
neither marcos nor his agents were aware of the specific contents 
of the cargo and that receipt of the luggage is not an admission 
of ownership

a government aids researcher hid his financial 
interest in a business while steering nearly 1 million worth of 
national institutes of health contracts to the company 
congressional investigators said monday 
as a result of the congressional probe and a resulting 
investigation by a federal grand jury researcher syed zaki 
salahuddin was suspended monday without pay nih officials said 
the national cancer institute and nih take violations of 
standards of conduct and concealment of financial interests in 
companies with which the government does business extremely 
seriously william raub acting director of nih said in 
announcing the suspension 
salahuddin was out of the country monday according to his 
brother sm salahuddin 
raub disclosed the suspension at a hearing before the house 
commerce investigations subcommittee whose chairman rep john d 
dingell dmich called the affair a sorry tale of gross 
conflict of interest 
we appear to have an atmosphere of waste and abuse at nih 
dingell said it is no great surprise that one or more nih 
scientists may have taken advantage of the lax atmosphere for 
personal gain 
raub said he was unaware of any potential sweetheart deal 
such as the one charged to salahuddin that has been rooted out by 
nih procedures over the past five years 
either we have a situation where human beings involved in nih 
contracts are not falling victim to temptation or nih procedures 
for detecting such conduct are not very good said rep ron wyden 
dore 
i have the same concerns you have raub replied 
investigators from the general accounting office an arm of 
congress have spent 16 months probing the case of salahuddin and 
pandata systems a small computer and biomedical company in 
rockville md among the findings 
the companys growth has been due in good part to a large 
number of nih contracts for goods and services most of which were 
bought by the laboratory headed by robert g gallo where 
salahuddin worked until monday 
salahuddin was one of two people authorized access to 
pandatas new post office box in 1984 shortly after the company 
was incorporated his wife firoza was listed as 25 percent owner 
in the papers of incorporation corporate minutes submitted to the 
small business administration a few months later indicated 
salahuddin was an equal shareholder and director 
in 1985 and 1986 nih was assured by the president of pandata 
that neither mr or mrs salahuddin has any connection to this 
company neither have ever received nor are they entitled to any 
gratification in any form monetary or otherwise 
said raub it certainly appears that the letters were 
false 
salahuddin filed required annual financialdisclosure 
statements with nih and never indicated any ownership of pandata 
in 1986 gallo confronted salahuddin with rumors of a financial 
interest in the company salahuddin said only his wife had been an 
employee and that she would quit 
documents submitted to sba identified salahuddin as a pandata 
owner and director of corporate development 
in 1988 salahuddin and another scientist in gallos lab were 
assigned to evaluate two proposed contracts for testing a herpes 
virus 
prior to participating in the technical evaluation salahuddin 
told the assistant project director that pandata systems was the 
only competent lab to perform the required assays said gao 
investigator clark b hall nih awarded contracts to pandata and a 
competitor 
salahuddin told nih officials wednesday that his wife had been a 
founder of pandata in 1987 or 1988 raub quoted salahuddin as 
saying the company had paid for the painting of the couples home 
and had made mortgage payments on the house to compensate for mrs 
salahuddins services as a founder 
raub said nih has tightened contractreview procedures in the 
wake of the salahuddin investigation

a womans fight for better housing with 
government assistance means that families across the country will 
have a wider choice of places to live her lawyer says 
ann smith a nursing student with three children sued federal 
and local housing authorities after she could not find an 
affordable apartment in narragansett and the towns housing 
officials would not allow her to use a rentsubsidy certificate 
elsewhere 
narragansett officials cited federal regulations that the 
certificates could be used only in the town in which they were 
issued 
but ms smith complained that the 691amonth limit on rent and 
utilities for a threebedroom apartment wasnt even close to 
rents in the city however she did find a suitable apartment in 
north kingstown 
as a result of her suit officials at the us department of 
housing and urban development now acknowledge they misinterpreted a 
1987 change in federal law and that the certificates can be used 
outside the community in which they are issued 
the opportunity for finding decent housing is going to be 
expanded greatly said robert m sabel a rhode island legal 
services lawyer who represented ms smith 
in rhode island 4417 families use the certificates for 
housing families must earn less than half the average local annual 
income and must contribute 30 percent of their income for rent 
ms smiths only income was 626 a month in aid to families with 
dependent children she said she did not have time to work between 
her nursing studies and caring for her children the oldest of whom 
is 10 
hud officials admitted they were wrong in january and later 
us district judge ronald r lagueux approved a settlement the 
providence journal reported monday 
the 1987 law said a certificate issued in a metropolitan area 
can be used anywhere within it so poor people arent forced to 
congregate in one area but hud officials originally interpreted 
that to mean the certificate must be used in the city where it was 
issued 
the agency now has ruled that a certificate is good for an area 
that includes a city and all the surrounding communities with 
strong economic and social ties to it for providence that 
includes all of rhode island as well as eight communities in 
massachusetts 
hud spokesman bill glavin said the federal agency soon would 
tell all housing authorities of the change

a latvian citizens group claiming to represent 
hundreds of thousands of latvians demanded monday that the republic 
follow lithuanias lead and declare independence from the soviet 
union a spokeswoman said 
in lithuania about 20000 people gathered to honor a countryman 
who burned himself to death in moscow to protest the kremlins 
efforts to end lithuanias independence drive 
lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis called the man the 
first victim in the struggle for independence and we hope he 
is the last he told the crowd according to giedrius drukteimis 
of the sajudis proindependence movement 
the latvian spokeswoman voicing sentiments identical to those 
heard in lithuania said this is an occupied country we are 
under soviet power here under an occupying army 
the latvian citizens congress elected mainly from among ethnic 
latvians convened monday and called for restoration of latvian 
independence spokeswoman iveeta buicke said 
latvia lithuania and estonia were independent countries between 
world war i and world war ii but were forcibly annexed by the 
soviet union in 1940 
ethnic latvians make up just over half of latvias population of 
27 million and a poll published monday by the soviet government 
newspaper izvestia said that 92 percent of those polled favor 
secession nonlatvian residents make up 46 percent of the 
republic and 45 percent were for independence 
the congress met three days before the official latvian supreme 
soviet parliament was to consider whether to emulate lithuanias 
march 11 declaration of independence 
the estonian parliament also has made clear it intends to follow 
lithuania in seceding from the soviet union but more cautiously 
the latvian congress claims the right to replace the republics 
supreme soviet during the transition to independence its members 
were elected in march by registered ethnic latvian voters it says 
it represents about 700000 latvians 
latvian politicians are predicting a heated parliamentary battle 
on the independence issue later this week 
may 3 and 4 are going to be very hot days said anda anspoka 
of the proindependence latvian peoples front which won a 
majority in the supreme soviet in elections held in march 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev recently warned latvian 
delegates that he would offer the republic special status in a 
reconfigured soviet federation but he would not accept outright 
secession 
gorbachev embargoed oil and natural gas shipments to lithuania 
in response to its parliaments declaration of independence 
although the sanctions do not seem to have dampened the lithuanians 
drive for sovereignty 
official vilnius radio reported on sunday that moscow planned to 
ease the sanctions by increasing natural gas deliveries to a large 
fertilizer plant at jonova 
however deliveries did not increase monday and it was 
impossible to learn whether they would start before the end of the 
may day holiday on wednesday 
the lithuanians continued their protests the body of the 
suicide victim stanislovas jamaitis 52 was flown to vilnius from 
moscow on monday and taken to the supreme council parliament 
building in central vilnius drukteimis said 
lithuanian radio and television broadcast announcements of the 
memorial service for jamaitis and soviet tv showed brief footage 
monday night of the crowds gathered near the parliament building 
jamaitis is to be buried wednesday in his home village of 
ezherelis near kaunas the republics second city 
landsbergis in a television appearance monday discouraged 
other lithuanians from similar actions in his speech at the 
gathering he emphasized that we dont need victims drukteimis 
said 
the suicide recalled the selfimmolation of lithuanian student 
roman kalanta in kaunas in 1972 kalanta became a martyr of 
lithuanian nationalism and the independence movement appeared to 
be preparing a similar role for jamaitis 
in the text of jamaitis suicide note released in lithuania on 
friday he said lithuanians will not live in a lithuania that is 
not independent 
jamaitis died thursday of burns he received when he doused 
himself with gasoline and set fire to himself in front of moscows 
bolshoi theater 
gorbachev has said that republics have the right to secede from 
the soviet union but only if they do so in accordance with soviet 
law 
a law on secession requires twothirds of a republics voters to 
approve independence in a referendum and calls for a subsequent 
waiting period of five years in which the republic and soviet union 
would negotiate the terms of secession

walk into maryellen viscontis center 
for peak performance and she shoots words like neurosensory 
development your way faster than a buzzing beta wave 
she runs a health club for the mind in a mall in this university 
town believing that mindbrain fitness is to the 90s what body 
fitness was to the 80s 
instead of slogans like no pain no gain visconti urges her 
clients to find the zone and get in the flow instead of 
weight machines visconti 2000 as the center is known offers a 
sound and light show using speciallydesigned goggles 
the goggles have little flashing red lights inside around the 
eyeholes anybody who kept their eyes open while wearing the 
goggles would shoot right out of the zone and into hyperactivity 
but with the eyes closed the lights flash subtle changing 
patterns on the lids 
the light shows are supposed to help clients reach a sort of 
meditative state so they can enhance creativity and accelerate 
learning or in viscontispeak to access personal skills and 
resources for creating the state of excellence to be in the flow 
a session with the goggles which usually lasts about 20 
minutes costs 25 
visconti stresses that she uses tapes books and workshops to 
educate clients but the nerve center of her mind gym is a room 
with two comfortable black chairs where customers settle in for 
sessions with goggles programmed to take them to the zone 
there are also headphones designed to produce the same effect via a 
low hum in the ears 
and what is the zone something like a hypnotic or 
meditative state achieved when brain waves go from the beta to the 
alpha level 
visconti describes the beta state as chatter chatter chatter 
because of outside stimulation the alpha state is a relaxed 
level where creativity and the ability to learn are at their peak 
she said 
for gary antonick winding up his studies at harvard 
universitys business school visconti 2000 sounded like a great 
idea 
antonick a fit and trim 27yearold said his experience as a 
swimmer first sparked his interest in mental gymnastics 
in college at the university of michigan antonick said he 
improved his performance on the school swim team through a 
technique called visualization 
i went from terrible to allamerican due to just a few minutes 
a day imagining what i was going to do in the water said 
antonick 
antonick said he has several goals for his mental workouts one 
is to improve his game literally im a terrible squash player 
and i worked on it for two months and i was still terrible he 
said 
the other is to improve his mental skills maybe pick up a 
language and the third is to keep himself healthy is it 
possible to cure a cold by visualization he wondered 
visconti cautions that her company is not a health center more 
an educational clinic she has no formal training in psychology 
but lists in her resume certifications in accelerated learning 
stress management and selftalk technology she originally was 
trained as a nutritionist and worked as a communications consultant 
for 20 years 
viscontis image is hardly that of the newage crystal wearing 
crunchy granola type in fact she looks every inch the 
businesswoman bustling about a hightech office decorated in stark 
black and white 
what got me really going on this was as a young child people 
told me i was very creative visconti said throughout my life 
i was very attracted to what the creative process was all about 
she opened the visconti 2000 center last fall although she 
wont say how many people now come to her on a regular basis she 
says the center has sparked inquiries from as far away as japan 
there are scientists who say so far research shows the best way 
to improve learning ability is the oldfashioned way with hard 
work 
there isnt any shortcut to that said james mcgaugh 
director of the center for neurobiology of learning and memory at 
the university of california irvine everything is pretty 
straightforward pay attention stay alert study hard

storms will delay 
discoverys return to florida but the orbiter was in excellent 
shape after its 21millionmile journey to launch the hubble space 
telescope nasa said monday 
you could almost roll this thing out there and fly it again 
shuttle processing manager tip talone said 
few problems were found during preliminary inspection talone 
said the shuttles heatshield tiles sustained 33 dings but 
only five tiles were damaged seriously enough to require 
replacement he said 
discovery equipped with new and improved brakes landed on a 
concrete runway at this desert military base on sunday after a 
fiveday mission to deploy the 15 billion telescope to study 
mysteries of the universe 
nasa engineers at the goddard space flight center in maryland 
said monday they got the orbiting telescope working again by 
freeing a movable antenna that had jammed after brushing against an 
electrical cable 
gusts up to 40 mph threatened to delay discoverys landing but 
subsided long enough later high winds kicked up a huge dust storm 
as crews towed discovery across the dry lakebed on which the runway 
is located 
it blew like hell talone said winds delayed efforts monday 
to lift discovery into its 100foottall steel trusswork 
maintenance structure 
heavy rain fell monday slowing shuttle maintenance work as 
crews had to cover thrusters and other sensitive components to 
prevent water from leaking inside he added 
it makes life more miserable for guys doing the work talone 
said of the rain 
discovery had been scheduled to leave edwards on friday mounted 
piggyback atop a modified jumbo jet for a oneday trip to kennedy 
space center in florida 
talone said the weather will delay the trip until saturday and 
possibly make it a twoday journey with an overnight stop at kelly 
air force base texas 
contributing to the delay was the need to remove one of 
discoverys many small maneuvering thrusters it failed and leaked 
just as the shuttle was being inserted into orbit after its april 
24 launch from florida he said 
just as has been the case after many previous shuttle flights 
talone insisted discovery returned to earth in better shape than 
any shuttle has previously 
each tie we fly these things it appears even better he 
said were getting a clean vehicle back 
talone said discoverys new carbon brakes similar to those used 
on passenger jets performed as well or even better than 
expected they were removed and shipped to their manufacturer 
bf goodrich in troy ohio for analysis 
but because columbia and atlantis havent yet been fitted with 
the improved brakes it will be late this year or early 1991 before 
the carbon brakes are tested again talone said 
the national aeronautics and space administration hopes the new 
brakes and other modifications will allow routine landings to 
resume at kennedy space center 
talone said other minor problems included some chafing on 
discoverys tires a protective black coating that flaked off the 
surface of one of the damaged tiles and unexplained but typical 
haze and streaks on the shuttles windshield 
during discoverys flight the crew found a watch that was lost 
by astronaut sonny carter when the shuttle flew on a classified 
defense department mission last november 
at kennedy space center meanwhile engineers found a small leak 
in the system that feeds liquid oxygen into the columbias main 
engines but said repairs shouldnt delay the shuttles scheduled 
may 16 launch to carry the astro observatory on a nineday mission 
discoverys next flight is scheduled to start oct 5 when it 
will launch the nasaeuropean space agencys ulysses spacecraft on 
a mission to orbit the suns poles

the united states will suspend trade benefits 
for liberia on july 1 but will allow thailand and indonesia to 
continue to participate despite charges they have violated workers 
rights a trade official said monday 
the bush administration found that liberia had not taken steps 
to better its record but that the two asian countries had 
according to the official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
about 130 areas in the third world were allowed last year to 
ship 10 billion worth of goods to the united states dutyfree or 
at reduced rates of duty the measures encourage imports from those 
areas because the lower duties make them cheaper and more 
attractive to importers than goods from competing countries 
auto equipment such as tires brakes and storage batteries are 
among the major imported items the program is being expanded and 
is expected to grow by at least 500 million this year 
other major importing countries have similar preference programs 
us labor organizations had complained that some governments 
violated internationally recognized workers rights by using child 
labor restricting the formation of labor unions and other 
measures us law requires suspending privileges for those 
countries 
a statement issued by trade representative carla hills said 
another year will be taken to review the cases against syria 
benin the dominican republic haiti and nepal 
romania nicaragua and burma remain suspended panama was 
reinstated earlier this year and poland and hungary were added to 
the list after the end of hardline communist rule there 
other eastern european countries are expected to follow and 
nicaragua is likely to be reinstated the official said 
new products will be made eligible from bolivia colombia 
ecuador and peru as part of the bush administrations decision to 
help wean them away from traffic in drugs

newly released hostage frank herbert reed 
was an intelligent adventurer who got caught up in middle east 
turbulence just as he was trying to leave the wartorn region 
friends and relatives say 
but they also say he had the yankee stoicism it takes to ride 
out even the storm of 3 years of captivity in lebanon 
he would never give up i hope its a reed trait we certainly 
are selfmade in what we do his 70yearold brother edward 
said after he and other family members received news of the release 
reed 57 had traveled to the north pole the jungles of brazil 
and the australian outback he was a teacher and school principal 
in new england and founded the admiral byrd polar club in 
whitefield nh which sponsored expeditions to antarctica 
but after making two trips to lebanon he left his post as 
school principal in new hampshire to become director of elementary 
education at beiruts international college in 1977 
it appealed to the adventurer in him maryellen cavan a 
former new hampshire colleague said of reeds decision to move 
later he converted to islam the religion of his wife fahima 
dalati 39 a syrian national who met him in 1977 while she was in 
training as a teacher 
when the international college was bombed out reed founded the 
private lebanese international school 
a nephew said reed decided to stay on because he believed he 
could be of help especially to young students and one of his 
daughters marilyn langston has said that education was all 
important to him 
still while reed came to believe violence was a way of life 
around beirut and that he could work around it he was not inured 
to it cavan said 
he was pretty flamboyant and wouldnt show he was afraid 
she said but it certainly unnerved him 
finally even reed decided to leave at the time of his 
abduction he was trying to make arrangements for his wife known 
as fifi to come to the united states and had intentions of

the investigation into last years murders of 
six salvadoran jesuit priests has ground to a halt and is unlikely 
to bring to justice all those responsible a house democratic task 
force charged monday 
the task force appointed by speaker thomas foley soon after the 
nov 16 murders issued a harshly critical report that appeared 
likely to fuel opposition to new us military aid to el salvador 
as of midapril the investigation and preparations for 
prosecuting the case have come to a virtual standstill reported 
the 19member group made up primarily of liberal democrats opposed 
to bush administration policy toward el salvador 
nine military officials were charged following the murders an 
unusual step in el salvador where death squads with military 
involvement have been carrying out executions for the past decade 
with apparent legal impunity 
but while the task force gave credit to president alfredo 
cristiani for pushing the investigation forward it said key 
questions remain unasked and that investigators and the judge in 
the case appear reluctant to pursue leads that could lead to 
involvement of higherups 
this lack of continued progress coupled with certain aspects 
of salvadoran law make it less likely that full justice will be 
done the report concluded adding that the failures are 
symptomatic of deep institutional problems in the military and the 
system of justice 
task force leader rep joe moakley dmass said he expected 
the report to bolster opponents of us military aid to el 
salvador the house foreign affairs committee last week approved a 
provision that would cut the 85 million annual aid in half and 
make the remaining aid contingent on progress toward peace at 
united nationssponsored talks by both the government and the 
leftist fmln rebels 
those charged in the murders are members of the elite 
ustrained atlacatl batallion 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said in an 
interview that he believes military aid should be limited 
i have grave reservations about continuing military aid 
especially at the current levels mitchell said i favor 
limitation and restriction of such aid in view of the tragedy that 
has occurred in that country over the past several years there 
has to be some change in our current policy 
secretary of state james a baker iii who has promised to seek 
a new bipartisan approach to us policy in el salvador was 
scheduling meetings this week with congressional leaders to open 
discussions 
miguel salaverria el salvadors ambassador to the united 
states disputed the reports conclusion that the investigation had 
stalled he said cristiani has a real concern that more 
investigation should be made into rumors that top military 
officials may be involved 
but salaverria added cutting aid now would be the wrong 
time to do it el salvador has never been closer to peace than we 
are at this moment 
he said he believed the murders came about because someone in 
this whole thing succumbed to provocation referring to rebel 
attacks on family members of mayors and military officers 
the task force also said those charged in the crime might never 
have been arrested if a us military officer an army major 
assigned to the us embassy in san salvador had not come forward 
in january with information implicating col alfredo benavides the 
most senior official charged 
the task force said it was very disappointed by the failure 
of the investigating unit to look seriously into whether superiors 
to benavides may have ordered or known about plans for the murders 
the judge handling the case ricardo zamora also has seemed at 
times uninterested in pursuing the case vigorously the group 
reported 
even today a series of questions about the possible 
involvement of higher officials in ordering the crimes remain 
unanswered and as far as can be determined unasked the report 
stated

prices farmers get for raw products increased 
07 percent from march to april raising the overall commodity 
index 2 percent above a year ago the agriculture department said 
monday 
but revisions showed the departments prices received index 
has declined about 2 percent from the record level set in january 
that included a decline in march instead of an increase shown by 
the preliminary figures a month ago 
according to the revisions the index rose 34 percent in 
january from its december average before dropping 13 percent in 
each of the next two months 
prices of raw agricultural products can swing widely during a 
single month and for that reason and others are not considered 
reliable indicators by themselves of overall food price trends at 
the consumer level 
higher prices for oranges corn potatoes and cattle were mostly 
responsible for the overall price increase from march the 
departments agricultural statistics board said in its preliminary 
report 
lower prices reported for tomatoes milk eggs and broilers 
partly offset the gains for the other commodities most prices are 
midapril averages which will be revised next month 
new quarterly figures showed prices paid by farmers to meet 
expenses were up 11 percent from january and averaged 34 percent 
more than in april 1989 
since january higher prices for feeder pigs and feeder cattle 
and calves were moderated by lower fuel and energy prices the 
report said 
prices of cars and trucks farm chemicals tractors and 
selfpropelled machinery were generally up from last years 
surveys most retail seed prics were lower than a year ago 
department economists say the net cash income of farmers in 1990 
may be in the range of 54 billion to 58 billion compared with 
about 53 billion in 1989 the record was 572 billion in 1988 
net cash income is the money nationally that farmers have left 
from gross cash income during a calendar year after deducting cash 
expenses it includes government payments and proceeds from crops 
grown previously but sold during the year 
in another method taking into account changes in inventories 
depreciation and other allowances during a calendar year shows that 
1990 net farm income may be in a range of 45 billion to 49 
billion compared with 49 billion last year 
consumer food prices are forecast by usda economists to rise 3 
percent to 5 percent this year after posting an average gain of 57 
percent in 1989 the sharpest rise since 1981 
based on the preliminary figures the april price index for 
livestock and poultry dropped 12 percent from march but still 
averaged 97 percent more than a year ago 
milk prices dropped an additional 60 cents in april to an 
average of 1310 per l00 pounds even so the preliminary april 
price was up 70 cents from april 1989 the farm price of milk rose 
to a record 16 per hundredweight in december 
crop prices overall rose 31 percent from march but averaged 7 
percent below the yearearlier level fruit prices led by oranges 
and grapefruit were up 11 percent from march and by the same 
margin of 11 percent from a year ago 
the index for commercial vegetables dropped 13 percent from 
march and averaged 28 percent below the yearearlier level 
reflecting abundant tomato supplies and low prices 
tomato prices were reported at 16 per 100 pounds down from 
3280 in march and 5580 in april 1989 onions however rose to 
23 per 100 pounds from 1960 in march and 1090 a year earlier 
prices of potatoes and dry beans which are measured 
collectively increased 14 percent from march to april and were up 
13 percent from a year earlier 
the report said 
cattle averaged 75 per 100 pounds of live weight nationally 
up from 7420 in march and 7010 in april 1989 those are 
averages for all types of cattle sold as beef 
hogs averaged 5290 per 100 pounds compared with 5130 in 
march and 3690 a year earlier 
corn at 252 a bushel was up from 237 in march but was 
just short of the 256 yearearlier average 
wheat prices at the farm according to preliminary figures 
averaged 351 per bushel compared with 349 in march and 403 a 
year earlier 
rice averaged 726 per 100 pounds compared with 750 in 
march and 674 in april 1989 
soybeans were 562 per bushel compared with 565 in march 
and 729 a year earlier 
upland cotton was reported at 648 cents per pound up from 
641 in march and 587 a year earlier 
eggs were 714 cents per dozen compared with 793 in march and 
661 in april 1989

the supreme court gave state governments and 
consumers a potential pocketbook victory monday saying they may 
use federal antitrust law to try to break up corporate mergers 
the unanimous decision empowers california officials to 
challenge a 25 billion merger of the lucky and alpha beta 
supermarket chains 
if the state wins its lawsuit and splits up the business deal 
officials said california consumers could save 440 million a year 
in grocery bills 
justice john paul stevens writing for the court said any 
opponent of a merger not just the federal government has the 
right to sue to force divestiture of merged businesses 
the ruling however does not give states and individuals the 
same sweeping power enjoyed by the federal government 
stevens said federal officials can force divestiture merely by 
proving an antitrust violation but said a private litigant 
must prove threatened loss or damage to his own interests in order 
to obtain relief 
the decision sends the supermarkets merger case back to lower 
courts where the state will try to prove the merger is illegal 
californias attorney general john van de kamp said he was 
delighted with the courts ruling its a great victory for 
californias consumers as well as consumers all over the country 
because this case is now national in its implications 
justice anthony m kennedy in a separate concurring opinion 
said the california attorney generals office still faces some 
hurdles at trial the state knew of the impending supermarket 
merger in early 1988 but waited months before it sued he said 
kennedy noted that the federal trade commission permitted the 
merger and that the breakup will upset labor agreements and 
other matters 
these considerations should bear upon the ultimate disposition 
of the case he said 
it was widely assumed before mondays decision that states and 
private citizens could prevent anticompetitive business 
combinations but could not interfere once such deals were completed 
but stevens said the clayton act passed in 1914 when congress 
was preoccupied with trustbusting on a national scale can be a 
weapon even against a completed merger 
lucky californias largest supermarket chain and alpha beta 
the fourth largest operate some 600 stores in the state 
alpha betas parent company american stores acquired lucky in 
june 1988 to merge the two chains under the lucky name american 
has 1500 stores in 40 states while luckys operations are in 
seven western and midwestern states 
american stores said california customers would save more than 
40 million a year because of increased efficiency but state 
officials said the merger would drive other competitors out of 
business and would lead to 440 million in higher grocery prices 
each year 
us district judge david kenyon in los angeles temporarily 
blocked the merger in 1988 and ordered separate operation of the 
two chains pending further litigation 
but the 9th us circuit court of appeals overturned the judges 
ruling and lifted the breakup order 
the appeals court said the state could have prevented the merger 
had it sued quickly enough but could not dissolve the completed 
business deal 
mondays decision overturned the appeals court ruling

artists and shop owners driven to distraction 
by loud brass bands blaring dixieland jazz in the heart of the 
french quarter lost their fight monday to establish courtordered 
quiet 
state judge richard ganucheau rejected a request that he order 
police to enforce new orleans antinoise ordinances in jackson 
square an area of stone sidewalks and greenery between the 
quarters st louis cathedral and the mississippi river 
novelty shops bars and artists who set up booths on the 
sidewalks cater to tourists in the area as do street musicians who 
collect money thrown into their hats or empty instrument cases 
at a hearing friday a city attorney argued that city police 
already try to enforce the antinoise ordinances by using decibel 
meters but he said the offending bands play more softly when 
they know they are being monitored 
the association of businessmen and artists of jackson square 
argued that more police manpower and more discreet use of the 
meters would help 
police say they do the best they can with the manpower available 
ganucheau said in his written ruling monday that it wasnt up to 
him to tell police how to allocate their resources 
this court finds that it does not have the authority to direct 
the superintendent of police in his method of enforcing the 
municipal noise ordinance he wrote

the nations couch potatoes say 
watching television is mindless boring addictive and takes less 
concentration than any activity short of sleep 
americans will spend an average of two hours per day the 
equivalent of seven years over a lifetime sitting in front of the 
tube according to a 13year study of viewers released monday 
viewers in the study reported their hours in front of the tube 
made them feel worse rather than better but like drug users 
struggling to kick an unwanted addiction they have a hard time 
pulling the plug 
a viscous cycle can develop wherein viewing begets more 
viewing said the studys coauthor robert kubey a rutgers 
university psychologist both the realization and escape that 
television so readily provides also leads many viewers to become 
dependent on the medium 
kubey and mihaly csikszentmihalyi of the university of chicago 
published their findings in a book television and the quality of 
life how viewing shapes everyday experience 
and while many turn to the tube to feel better they usually 
wind up feeling worse after a dose of news cop shows and sitcoms 
viewers said they become more drowsy bored sadder lonelier and 
hostile the more they watch 
the misery is a sort of family activity the researchers found 
while television generally increases the total time that 
family members spend together it tends to reduce their interaction 
with one another and they spend a disproportionate amount of this 
time together in a passive mode kubey said 
spokesmen from abc and nbc said they were looking at information 
from the study and werent ready to comment a cbs spokeswoman did 
not immediately return a telephone call seeking comment 
howard gardner a psychologist at harvard university said the 
project is seen as one of the most inclusive analyses on the 
effects of television among thousands of studies on the medium 
to assess viewing patterns and the impact they have on mood the 
researchers said they looked at viewers in a different way than in 
previous studies 
instead of asking them to recall events or take tests in a 
laboratory csikszentmihalyi and kubey asked 1200 people ranging 
from age 10 to 82 to carry beepers and to write down how they felt 
every time it went off 
basically csikszentmihalyi said we collected a series of 
snapshots of what people were doing and how they felt at the time 
we were thus able to map moods and patterns of behavior that 
may have eluded the subjects themselves 
the researchers discovered a perverse sort of benefit from the 
tvinduced trance 
certainly it can be argued that using television in this 
manner habitually is no worse and may indeed be better than 
habitually using alcohol or other moodaltering substances

former sen harrison a williams jr of new 
jersey has agreed to pay off 47000 remaining from his 1981 fine 
for bribery and conspiracy in the abscam case his attorney said 
monday 
we believe by the end of this summer his fine will be paid in 
full john d arsenault said from his office in roseland nj 
dick lavinthal a spokesman for the us attorneys office in 
new jersey declined to comment 
rep john j duncan jr rtenn said the justice department 
had told him of an agreement by which williams would pay the rest 
of his 50000 penalty duncan had asked the justice department 
last year to consider recovering the money from williams federal 
pension 
sen williams apparently had a change of heart after i prodded 
the justice department duncan said 
but arsenault said his intention was always to pay it off 
there has never been a question about that contrary to popular 
belief he doesnt have 50000 laying around in a closet 
someplace he does not have any appreciable assets 
however the attorney declined to say how williams a volunteer 
at a drug crisis center in newark nj with no other earned 
income would find the money to repay his fine 
i presume there may be some debt involved in paying this 
off he said 
arsenault said that as of february arrangements already had 
been made to satisfy the obligation through negotiations with the 
us attorneys office 
according to arsenault williams has cooperated with the justice 
department since his release from prison in 1986 
williams was released on good behavior after serving two years 
of concurrent twoyear and threeyear sentences for bribery 
conflict of interest and conspiracy in the abscam sting 
in abscam undercover agents posing as middlemen for arab sheiks 
made a deal with williams he agreed to accept a hidden interest in 
a virginia titanium mine in return for helping to find military 
contracts for the venture according to evidence from his trial

jury selection began monday for the trial 
of a man who faces a possible life prison sentence if convicted of 
poisoning a famous centuriesold oak tree 
paul stedman cullen 46 is accused of pouring the herbicide 
velpar around the base of the treaty oak where according to 
folklore stephen f austin signed a treaty with indians in the 
1820s austin is regarded as the father of texas 
the poisoning was discovered memorial day half of the 60foot 
tree has died despite 100000 in donations and herculean efforts 
to save it officials have said 
the act shocked residents and touched people around the country 
many sent getwell cards to the tree or stopped to write messages 
and leave tokens at its base 
workers have severed the most severely affected roots and have 
injected sugar water in hopes of diluting the poison 
cullen of elroy was charged with felony criminal mischief and 
has been in jail without bail for more than 10 months he could be 
sentenced to life in prison if convicted because he has a prior 
burglary conviction 
police and prosecutors have never detailed the suspected motive 
when cullen was arrested on june 29 1989 an arrest warrant 
alleged the poisoning was part of a ritual 
sgt john jones who investigated the case refused to elaborate 
the austin americanstatesman reported before his arrest that a 
suspect in the case was trying to cast a spell in a romantic matter 
said jones the occults really got nothing to do with it 
hes charged with damaging the tree normally what we have to 
prove is intentionally and knowingly damaging property we dont 
necessarily have to prove why he did it 
attorneys expect the trial to last about two weeks 
cullen also could face up to 15 years in prison for federal 
charges of possession of a firearm by a felon and making a false 
statement to a firearms dealer the charges stem from a 22caliber 
rifle that police say was found in his truck when he was arrested

nasa engineers got the 
15 billion hubble space telescope working monday with the help of 
a model built with a piece of lamp cord and plastic sticks from a 
toy store 
the model helped engineers visualize what was jamming one of the 
primary antennas on the telescope which was put into a 381mile 
high orbit last wednesday by astronauts on the space shuttle 
discovery 
analysis showed that one of the telescopes highgain antennas 
was jammed when it brushed against an electrical cable that was too 
long by about an inch 
we are still investigating it to understand how did this 
really happen why did it happen why didnt we catch it said 
jean olivier one of the top nasa officials on the project were 
not through with that investigation 
by tuesday evening the telescope should be in a condition where 
calibration and other normal startup work can begin said mike 
harrington director of the troubleshooting team 
the antenna jammed on friday when engineers were running it 
through its paces sensing something wrong and trying to prevent 
damage the telescopes computer shut down the whole system the 
telescopes two highgain antennas are designed to transmit science 
data to two orbiting relay satellites at very high speeds up to 
the equivalent of a 30volume encyclopedia in 42 minutes 
for a while we were puzzled as to the data we were receiving 
from the spacecraft and therefore lacked a clear understanding 
physically of what the problem was with the high gains olivier 
said all that has significantly changed 
detective work by nasa and its contractor teams led to an 
understanding of the problem 
while studying prelaunch photographs of the telescope nestled 
in the cargo bay of space shuttle discovery an engineer noticed 
that an inchthick electrical cable on the back of the antenna was 
slightly out of position 
olivier said the length of the cable was determined by computer 
simulations and turned out to be an inch or so too long the 
antenna movement could not be tested on earth because the motors 
are not powerful enough to move the antenna in the presence of 
gravity 
from the photographs engineers decided the toolong loop had 
shifted over to one side with that clue engineers looked over 
their telemetry data again and reasoned that counterweights began 
to run against the cable when the antenna was turned into certain 
positions 
we were faced with a problem that involved quite intricate 
geometry said david skillman an engineer at nasas goddard 
space flight center he drove to a toy store and bought two boxes 
of a wellknown construction set in another store he got an 
extension cord knife masking tape and glue 
he and engineer john decker assewmbled the model in 15 minutes 
this is how we determined if it was the cable that was the 
problem skillman said sure enough when we set the models to 
angles on our computer screen we could see the interference in the 
antenna parts and cable 
nasa has plenty of models of the telescope but they are big 
fragile and unsuitable for that kind of demonstration said nasa 
spokeswoman janet ruff 
we determined that there was a proper motion that we should 
carry this antenna through to bring it carefully away in the right 
direction so it wouldnt upset the control system olivier said 
we successfully did that and we are all relieved to know that our 
theories were correct 
the antennas shaped like a dish are at the end of masts and 
the cable is coiled along the length terminating in the loop one 
motor causes them to look up and down 90 degrees in each 
direction the other the one that had problems looks left and 
right 
the antennas send their signal to one of two tracking and data 
relay satellites orbiting earth and store their information on tape 
recorders when they are not in communication with the satellites 
because of that said olivier the slight limits on the antennas 
movement to avoid contact with the cable will have only a small 
impact 
the first test image from the telescope had been expected by 
tuesday but now is delayed until the weekend harrington said 
the telescope named after the famed astronomer edwin hubble 
was carried into space by space shuttle discovery and released into 
a 381mile high orbit last wednesday its mission is to look back 
in time for some 14 billion years when the universe was young 
meanwhile nasa said discovery which landed on sunday at 
edwards air force base sustained only minimal damage to its 
heatprotecting tiles it is scheduled to be returned to the 
kennedy space center at the end of the week

women loaning men money is commonplace 
nowadays but in firstcentury egypt that meant marriage 
university of michigan researchers recently deciphered documents 
suggesting women in ancient egypt made shortterm loans to their 
prospective mates to guarantee their fidelity before and during 
marriage 
the 22 documents deciphered by classical studies professor 
ludwig koenen and two assistants recorded the business and legal 
transactions of the pausiris family the family lived about 70 ad 
in oxyrhynchos then a major city under roman rule 
the documents include several loan receipts made out to dioskous 
pausiris by thermouthis his wife of one year 
thermouthis probably came from a lowermiddleclass family and 
couldnt afford a dowry to secure a marriage contract koenen said 
such women instead obtained financial security by loaning their 
fiances small amounts of money he said 
researchers at the ann arbor school deciphered evidence that 
thermouthis loaned a small amount to dioskous for two months 
shortly before they married 
although none of the documents described the couples personal 
relationship one a canceled loan receipt dated about a year 
after the marriage indicates dioskous repaid a second larger 
loan then got a divorce 
where did he get the money perhaps he had a good business 
year but a cynic would suspect that he had found another lady who 
would give him a loan koenen speculated 
the researchers findings will be published this summer the 
university said

german unification 
mikhail s gorbachev reiterated the soviet unions opposition to 
a united germanys membership in nato during a meeting sunday in 
moscow with east german prime minister lothar de maiziere 
the soviet union is concerned that a unified germany within nato 
would upset the current european balance of power to moscows 
disadvantage 
shevardnadze has signaled that moscow was prepared to drop its 
demand for a neutral unified germany he said the soviet union is 
open to proposals for new european security structures including a 
proposal that a united germany belong to both nato and the warsaw 
pact 
west germany and its nato allies have insisted that a united 
germany must remain in the western alliance 
de maizere was quoted in the east german communist party 
newspaper neues deutschland on monday as saying east germany should 
act as a mediator between the soviet union and the west on german 
unification 
east germany has said it is willing to go along with temporary 
nato membership if the alliance undergoes fundamental changes 
reflecting the eastwest thaw by emphasizing political and economic 
issues over its military role

two greenpeace activists climbed 150 feet up the 
georgiapacific building on monday and unfurled a banner to protest 
the companys use of chlorine in the manufacture of paper pulp 
a 30by12 foot banner reading take the poison out of pulp 
was unfurled after the climbers reached the 13th floor of the 
52story building about 830 am the building was chosen because 
atlantabased georgiapacific is the largest pulp operator in the 
nation a greenpeace spokesman said 
about 200 passersby stopped to watch the fivehour protest 
which coincided with the release in washington of an environmental 
protection agency report on dioxins found in bleached paper 
the epa said the amount of dioxin in such items as milk cartons 
and toilet tissue is too small to pose a health hazard but the 
agency is concerned about dioxin contamination of waterways near 
some paper mills 
the issue is not dioxin but chlorine it is an unnecessary 
raw material in paper production said greenpeace spokesman brian 
hunt 
several european nations have already made the conversion to 
nonchlorine bleaching processes that yield highquality 
highwhiteness paper were here to encourage georgiapacific to 
take the chlorine out of pulp he said 
beth zoffmann a georgiapacific spokeswoman said chlorine 
produces only a minute quantity of dioxin and added we believe 
our products are safe 
pointing up at the two protesters she said this creates a 
far greater risk than the entire production of dioxin in pulp they 
are creating an unnecessary risk to themselves and the people on 
the ground there is no need for that showmanship type activity 
police arrested the pair identified by greenpeace as dj 
lachappelle 24 of washington dc and laurel greenberg 31 of 
boston after they descended police said they would be charged 
with criminal trespass and reckless conduct but no charges were

secretary of state james a baker iii on 
monday accused israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir of missing an 
important opportunity to move peace forward and scuttling shamirs 
own plan for talks with palestinian arabs 
baker leveled the criticism through his spokeswoman margaret d 
tutwiler as usisraeli differences over the failure to set up 
mideast negotiations deepened 
even so the department spokeswoman said she assumed we will 
pick up where we left off after israel forms a new government 
under shamir or another israeli leader 
vice president dan quayle also pledged us perseverance we 
must and we will continue the arabisraeli peace process he said 
at a seminar on the superpowers role in the mideast 
the bakershamir rift broke into the open after the israeli 
government collapsed last month in disagreement over a us formula 
for holding talks with palestinians 
shamir had proposed last may to hold elections among 
palestinians on the west bank and in gaza the formula the prime 
minister refused to endorse had been worked out by baker over 
months of negotiations with israel egypt and indirectly the 
palestine liberation organization 
specifically shamir objected to having palestinians who were 
ousted from the west bank or who resided in east jerusalem in the 
delegation he is determined to have israel retain the territory 
that jordan held from 1948 until its defeat in the 1967 sixday war 
on sunday the prime minister said no one can expect us to 
accept every proposal and every idea of the american secretary be 
what they may be 
shamir also vowed to continue settling jews on the west bank and 
in gaza which egypt occupied until 1967 the bush administration 
has objected saying the settlements are an obstacle to peace 
were perplexed by the prime ministers statement bakers 
spokeswoman said 
weve been working so closely with the government of israel on 
the peace process ms tutwiler said reading from a prepared 
statement 
she said the israeli government had asked the bush 
administration to find a palestinian partner from the 
territories to help implement shamirs elections initiative 
we were on the verge of accomplishing that objective ms 
tutwiler said in fact we felt we were close to producing 
palestinians from the territories who were prepared to talk to 
israel about the elections in the territories 
bakers formula would have enabled us to do this the 
spokeswoman said so saying yes meant saying yes to the 
government of israels plan yes to israelipalestinian dialogue 
and yes to peace 
on the other hand ms tutwiler added continuing to say no 
will give us very little to work with and will probably mean losing 
an important opportunity to move peace forward 
shamir is in the midst of trying to form a new government it is 
likely to be as hardline as the fallen coalition with the dovish 
labor party 
still ms tutwiler said we hope once the political situation 
in israel clarifies we can work with the government of israel to 
move ahead 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee characterized the rift as one between the shamir and 
bush administration rather than a conflict between israel and the 
united states 
the bush administration has adopted a policy of trying to 
crowd the likud government he said if peres were to form a 
government aspin told the mideast seminar the us rhetoric 
would stop 
meanwhile richard n haass director of middle east affairs at 
the national security council said israels internal political 
problems raise a question about the governments willingness to 
go along with the shamir election initiative 
but leaving it alone is not the answer haass said at an 
academic seminar 
haass said the administration would press on with its attempt to 
bring israelis and palestinians to the negotiating table because 
the passage of time without any solution works against moderate 
forces in the region

amtrak would have to suspend passenger 
rail service to florida if a judge rules that it must quit dumping 
sewage from moving trains amtraks president testified monday 
w graham claytor jr amtraks president and chief operating 
officer was the first witness as three days of hearings began 
before us district judge howell w melton 
melton is to decide if the national railroad can be prosecuted 
for dumping waste in northern florida waterways 
amtrak appealed to federal court after a state jury found amtrak 
guilty in early december of four felony counts of commercial 
littering into the st johns river and rice creek 
amtrak cars now serving florida either drop waste directly on 
the track or put it into a holding tank which is dumped when the 
train reaches a speed of 25 mph claytor said 
with the present equipment owned by amtrak claytor said it 
would be impossible for it to continue service into florida if 
melton rules in favor of the state 
there is no way to comply he said 
he testified the railroad is studying ways to modify existing 
cars and plans to equip new cars so sewage wont be dumped on the 
tracks 
but thats a longterm solution which will require congress to 
appropriate money and would not address the shortterm problem of 
cars dumping waste claytor said 
in todays environment it is better not to do it at all and 
we agree and we are working on it he said 
assistant state attorney dennis bayer said in his opening 
arguments that the issue is whether federal law preempts state law 
and whether amtrak can continue to indiscriminately dump raw 
human sewage into floridas waterways 
this court should deny amtraks efforts to derail the state 
criminal prosecution and allow floridas courts to interpret laws 
designed to protect the waters of the state and the citizens who 
use the waters bayer said in his trial brief 
edward booth an attorney representing amtrak said amtrak is 
not subject to floridas laws prohibiting the disposal of waste 
from trains he argued that allowing the state to enforce its laws 
would interfere with interstate commerce 
melton blocked a jan 18 criminal sentencing of the railroad 
pending the outcome of this hearing if melton rules that state law 
applies to amtrak the railroad could be subject to about 20000 
in fines

irans antiwestern radicals have 
criticized suggestions that tehran consider opening direct talks 
with washington the official islamic republic news agency reported 
monday 
the agency monitored in nicosia quoted tehrans kayhan daily 
as saying in an editorial sunday that any move toward dialogue with 
the united states deviated from the teachings of irans late 
revolutionary leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini who died of 
cancer june 3 
the comments followed the april 22 release of us hostage 
robert polhill but came before mondays freeing of hostage frank 
herbert reed both had been held by an iranianbacked shiite 
faction in lebanon 
the editorial was commenting on a suggestion vice president 
ataollah mohajerani in an article published in tehrens etelaat 
daily thursday that proposals for direct usiranian talks should 
be considered by the tehran government 
president hashemi rafsanjani leader of irans socalled 
pragmatists is seeking to end irans isolation and improve links 
with the west and the media broadside underlined the opposition he 
faces from tehran radicals 
rafsanjani has been seeking to secure the release of western 
hostages held by proiranian shiite moslem militants in lebanon 
polhills release the first freeing of a us hostage in 
lebanon in more than three years was seen as a victory for 
rafsanjani and a first step toward breaking the deadlock in 
usiranian relations 
veteran analyst charles snow wrote in mondays edition of the 
respected middle east economic survey the release of mr polhill 
is unmistakably a conciliatory gesture which should be rewarded 
both for its own sake unless the us actually wishes to play into 
the hands of the radicals in tehran and in order to encourage the 
iranians to do more of the same 
the problem is however that mr bush has also inherited an 
ironclad commitment not to trade for hostages or at least not to 
appear to do so and must therefore try somehow to differentiate 
between a reciprocal gesture and a quid pro quo 
so far mr bush has responded with the standard litany 
saying i dont trade for hostages snow wrote 
the tehran times an englishlanguage daily associated with 
rafsanjani sunday had quoted an unidentified iranian official as 
saying there had been extensive talks between tehran and the 
kidnappers 
kayhan warned any dialogue with the united states will mean 
burying the achievements of khomeinis 1979 islamic revolution 
that toppled the prowestern shah and a major retreat 
it said mohajeranis suggestion amounted to urging tehran to 
stop fighting against the arrogance the word iranians use to 
describe the united states and its allies and to bow down to the 
americans and the west 
reestablishing ties with the united states would signal 
accepting the rule of opponents of khomeinis divine rule and 
destroy the revolution kayhan declared 
the radical jomhuri islami daily also lashed out at mohajeranis 
deviation irna reported 
the leader of irans radicals former interior minister ali 
akbar mohtashemi wrote in a kayhan commentary that mohajeranis 
article was begging for mercy from the great satan a term some 
iranians use for the united states 
mohtashemi who was elected to parliament in december and has 
sought to mobilize opposition to rafsanjani said the vice 
presidents article was irresponsible and advocated the death 
of the islamic revolution 
the former minister who helped organize shiite militants in 
lebanon in the early 1980s cited us crimes and plots to 
overthrow the islamic republic as proof of us hostility

the crew that discovered the 
wreck of the titanic used a robot diver monday to explore a war of 
1812era wreck in lake ontario and shared the expedition with 
children across north america 
the cameraequipped robot examined the hamilton a merchant 
schooner that the british pressed into service as a warship 
students at 14 spots in the united states and canada watched 
satellite tv transmissions a few students even got to try steering 
the robot through a satellite link using joysticks like those used 
with computer games it transmitted pictures to students watching 
through satellite hookups at 14 locations in the united states and 
canada 
cannons railings and the ships elegantly carved figurehead 
could be seen in the television transmission 
robert d ballard the expeditions leader said the ships 
state of preservation was remarkable 
we can see the caulking in the planks he said 
the hamilton and its sister ship the scourge sank during a 
storm on aug 8 1813 killing 53 sailors they had taken part in 
several battles for the british against us forces that invaded 
southern canada during the war 
the wrecks remained undisturbed in 300 feet of water six miles 
off st catharines about 30 miles south of toronto and less than 
10 miles west of the us border at niagara falls until their 
discovery in 1975 
since then there have been several attempts to examine the 
wrecks including one by french explorer jacques cousteau but none 
were technologically advanced enough to reach them 
the cold fresh water helped keep the ships in much better 
condition than most wrecks said shelley lauzon a project 
spokeswoman 
the wood on the titanic is all gone because there are 
woodboring animals in salt water lauzon said theyre not 
present here 
ballard director of the center for marine exploration at the 
woods hole oceanographic institution in massachusetts led the 1985 
expedition that discovered the wreck of the titanic the ocean 
liner sank in the north atlantic after ramming an iceberg in 1912 
ballard said mondays examination of the hamilton and the 
scourge was aimed more at teaching children about archaeology and 
oceanography than at making startling new discoveries about the two 
warships 
weve had four students actually take control and operate the 
vehicle beautifully he said in an interview by shiptoshore 
telephone that was the biggest technological feat 
the children controlled the robot with a joystick linked to the 
system by satellite lauzon said a computer program restricted the 
robots movements so the children could not damage it 
although there were no archaeological breakthroughs the 
expedition did reveal a number of details not known before ballard 
said 
the twoweek expedition will prepare a comprehensive diagram of 
both ships and could provide information allowing the city of 
hamilton which has title to the wrecks to decide whether they are 
worth raising ballard said there appeared to be little damage that 
would stand in the way of such an effort 
theres no suggestion that they suffered any damage due to the 
sinking itself he said they just got flooded and went down 
very gently

five major opposition parties on 
monday threatened to boycott national elections and accused the 
dominant national salvation front of harassing opposition activists 
a joint communique by the opposition groups was released as 
thousands of protesters rallied in central bucharest for the ninth 
consecutive day to demand the resignation of interim president ion 
iliescu whom they accused of monopolizing power and favoring 
communism 
the statement warned if the government does not take measures 
to ensure democratic elections our parties will be forced not to 
participate in such rigged elections 
our parties activists have been violently attacked our 
newspapers and magazines do not reach their destinations the 
statement charged 
the national salvation front meanwhile enjoys the 
administrative financial and technical means of the old ruling 
structure it said 
the national salvation front took power after a december 
revolution that toppled communist dictator nicolae ceausescu the 
front continues to dominate an interim governing coalition and 
parliament 
the statement was signed by the national peasants party the 
national liberal party the social democratic party the free 
democratic party and the socialist liberal party 
on friday iliescu rejected demands to postpone elections 
scheduled for may 20 insisting that we have been living in a 
provisional state for long enough 
iliescu a former communist official who became a critic of 
ceausescu in recent years called the accusation that he is a 
neocommunist an electoral maneuver 
he said he has had to persuade his supporters not to go over 
to the square like a bulldozer and wipe out the demonstration 
on monday 4000 protesters crowded in university square now 
filled with makeshift tents and sleeping bags as their protest 
entered its ninth day 
stelian tanase a leader of the group for social dialogue a 
regular speaker at the demonstration accused iliescu of offering 
us communism in a sweet box 
we want sweeping changes not perestroika boomed the 
bearded tanase as the crowd roared its approval 
each night the protest has been capped with a rousing rendition 
of what has become the demonstrators antigovernment anthem 
better a tramp than traitor 
better a hooligan than a dictator 
better a ruffian than an communist party activist 
better dead than a communist

rescuers said bodies were scattered over the hillside on south 
harris in the hebrides island chain off the northwest coast of 
scotland they did not report finding anyone alive 
there was nothing we could do when we arrived said 
stornoway fire officer john norman macdonald it was all over 
before anyone could get to the scene 
a yellow sea king helicopter winched bodies aboard monday night

a witness builder kenny mackay said the wreckage was spread 
over about 1 miles 
i heard the plane going over the village very low and then 
there was a thundery noise you could feel a tremor shaking your 
feet but we couldnt see anything because the hill was covered in 
thick fog he said 
we went up to the hill and all we could see was burned heather 
and bits of plane all over the place

kept firefighters at bay for several hours monday and forced the 
evacuation of at least 2000 people including nearly 150 nursing 
home patients authorities said

smoldering at late afternoon but air samples tested by spiltech 
inc of little rock found conditions were safe said franklin 
county sheriff gordon mccain he said people were told they could 
return home at about 2 pm 
no injuries were reported 
the fire was reported about 645 am firefighters began dousing 
the fire but had to pull back after about 45 minutes when their 
air tanks ran out state police spokesman mack hayden said 
a team with air equipment from fort chaffee arrived later in the 
morning he said until then emergency officials had to watch the 
fire from a makeshift headquarters on a hill about a quarter mile 
from the blaze 
the cause of the fire was not yet known mccain said he said 
damage caused by the fire which destroyed the plant probably will 
run into the millions of dollars 
the entire west side of the town of about 4000 was evacuated

caretaker prime minister yitzhak shamir said 
monday he will seek a narrow centerright coalition as he attempts 
to form israels next government and will not ask the leftleaning 
labor party to join 
in the past shamir head of the rightwing likud bloc has 
advocated a national unity government with labor mainly 
because such a broad coalition reduced the leverage of small 
ultrarightist and religious parties 
also monday israels 42nd independence day leaders of a 
growing electoral reform campaign met with president chaim herzog 
and presented him with 501000 signatures of israelis backing the 
drive israel has a population of 46 million 
the meeting came after herzog issued a strong call for electoral 
reform and said israeli politicians have shown total contempt for 
the principles of democracy in their quest to rule 
in parks forests and on mediterranean beaches millions of 
israelis celeberated independence day with picnics and barbecues 
police reported massive traffic jams and israel radio said 
recreation sites were filled 
this years independence day found the country plagued by 
political divisions and unable to form a strong government since 
the march 15 collapse of a likudlabor coalition 
labor leader shimon peres failed last week to form a governing 
coalition and herzog on friday asked shamir to try 
under the current conditions i dont see a chance to form a 
government with labor shamir told israel radio in an interview 
broadcast monday 
im certain that a rightist government headed by me even if 
it is a minority government will have more success in advancing 
peace than a government that includes leftist factions that openly 
advocate the establishment of a palestinian state shamir said 
shamir and his rightwing allies reject proposals by secretary 
of state james a baker iii that would provide the framework for 
preliminary israelipalestinian peace talks in cairo shamir says 
he fears the talks could lead to indirect palestine liberation 
organization participation in negotiations 
under bakers plan the two sides would discuss shamirs 
proposal to hold elections in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip those elected would negotiate the final status of the 
occupied lands with israel 
on monday state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler told 
reporters that the us government was perplexed by shamirs 
rejection of bakers efforts 
continuing to say no will give us very little to work with and 
will probably mean losing an important opportunity to move peace 
forward she said 
shamir currently has the backing of 61 members in the 120member 
parliament labor party legislator ephraim gur told israel 
television on monday night that he might move over to the likud 
camp broadening shamirs support 
last months defection and redefection of several legislators 
lured by offers of political jobs from labor and likud has angered 
many israelis and sparked an electoral reform campaign many 
israelis want a change in the system of proportional representation 
to reduce the influence of small religious parties 
several thousand demonstrators staged a protest rally in front 
of parliament on monday to push for a new political system 
herzog dedicated a major part of his traditional independence 
day speech sunday night to the subject 
how can citizens who have the democratic right to choose their 
representatives watch calmly the political phenomena revealing a 
total contempt for the principles of democracy he said 
i want to use this opportunity and appeal to the political 
leaders not to ignore the voice of the people herzog said 
the president did not specify what system he favored and warned 
that reform is not a wonder drug that will remove all the 
troubles from our public life

a 2000footwide river of lava from 
kilauea volcano destroyed another house monday as it threatened to 
bury and burn the center of this coastal community 
kilauea the worlds most active volcano was pumping all of its 
daily output of 650000 cubic yards of molten rock into the 
kalapana area on hawaii island and authorities had little hope the 
community would survive 
this is a massive glacier of lava at least a quarter of a 
mile wide at least 10 to 40 feet high behind the front of the 
flow said hawaii county civil defense administrator harry kim 
kilauea has destroyed 120 homes since its latest eruption began 
jan 3 1983 44 of them in april 
lava was a quartermile from the kalapana store and drivein and 
two churches in the town center which kim said could be overrun by 
tuesday at the earliest 
walter yamaguchi who built the store in 1974 said he was 
content to leave the fate of his business in the hands of god and 
the volcano goddess pele 
in fact madame pele owns the whole place so i believe in her 
and i believe in god the 82yearold man said i leave it up 
to the good lord whether i win i leave it up to heaven 
parishioners made plans to move the historic star of the sea 
church which sits on an oceanfront lot in the direct path of the 
lava a trucking company volunteered to move the church for free 
volunteers began removing the churchs stained glass windows friday 
robert lippi chief financial offer for the roman catholic 
diocese in honolulu said church officials would wait until lava 
was certain to overrun the church before moving it 
it looks pretty inevitable he said 
leaders of kalapana mauna kea congregational church located 
across the street from star of the sea said the churchs structure 
was rotten from termites and not worth saving 
they said some artifacts and a church bell made in the 1800s 
would be the only things salvaged

president bush saying things seem to be 
moving hailed the release monday of a second american hostage in 
lebanon but said there could be no rest until all hostages are 
free 
i hope this is a forerunner to the release of the other 
american hostages and the others from other countries held against 
their will bush said 
bush spoke as he welcomed former hostage robert polhill to the 
white house the meeting came just hours after another hostage 
frank reed was turned over in beirut to syrian officials after 43 
months of captivity 
the president pointedly thanked iran and syria for their efforts 
in winning the hostages release but he added that no one can 
expect a return to normal relations or expect vast improvement 
until all americans are free 
i hope theres a realization that holding people against their 
will is not the way to affect political change bush said 
asked if israel ought to release a shiite cleric sheik 
abdulkarim obeid and others as demanded by a tehran newspaper as 
a next step bush said he would have no objections to such an 
action 
that is a matter for others to determine he added 
the state department in its annual report on terrorism released 
monday criticized both iran and syria iran still uses terrorism 
in pursuit of foreign policy goals and syria continued to support 
a variety of terrorist groups the report said 
polhill accompanied by his wife ferial clasped bush with both 
hands in a warm handshake 
speaking in a raspy whisper polhill said he could not provide 
any clues about the other six americans still held hostage 
you may be surprised but i really dont know very much about 
what was going on around me polhill said the only thing i can 
suggest is that the american people continue to show as hostages 
continue to be released on a regular basis how much we are wanted 
back 
bush met with polhill for an hour in the executive mansion 
accompanied by senior white house aides and the presidents wife 
barbara he described his life in captivity and gave his 
impressions of his captors of the confusing situation in beirut 
and of the hardship he suffered during 3 years said white house 
press secretary marlin fitzwater 
the president took polhill aside at one point to receive a 
private message from his former kidnappers fitzwater said bush 
refused to reveal the contents of the message publicly 
apparently polhill told his captors he would deliver a message 
privately and personally to president bush only fitzwater said 
and thats what he did 
bush and polhill also talked by telephone briefly with reed in 
damascus bush wished him well and polhill and reed exchanged warm 
greetings fitzwater reported 
bush said the meeting with polhill came at a very special 
moment because reed had just been freed the president said he 
expected to talk soon with reed by telephone in damascus syria 
where he was taken 
i do want to take this opportunity to thank syria for its role 
in not only bringing mr polhill home but its role in the reed 
release and similarly to iran for its role bush said 
expressing hopes for release soon of the other hostages six 
americans and 10 other westerners bush said things seem to be 
moving on this 
i cant explain the rationale but i can express a certain 
gratitude that things seem to be moving and what i feel in my 
heart about the return of now these two americans is in a sense 
overwhelming 
but i dont think any american can totally rejoice until the 
rest are free and indeed we cant limit our concern and our 
feelings to just the americans in my view 
iran meanwhile said no more americans would be released unless 
the united states reciprocated with a gesture in line with bushs 
oftstated promise that goodwill begets goodwill 
now the ball is in the court of the us and the western 
countries said the englishlanguage tehran times considered 
close to president hashemi rafsanjani 
asked if he was ready to make a goodwill gesture in return for 
the hostages release bush said all must be freed 
were not in a piecemeal basis bidding for one human life 
holding out hopes only to have them dashed for one american family 
or another he said 
in a statement released earlier after reeds impending release 
was announced bush said we urge all parties who either hold 
hostages or have any influence over the hostage takers to work for 
the expeditious and unconditional release of the remaining 
hostages 
the white house said it had made no deals to win reeds freedom 
but that iran and syria apparently were working to free the 
hostages in hopes of improving relations with washington 
this is a joyous day for mr reed his family his friends and 
all americans bush said in the written statement however in a 
reference to the others still held he said their predicament 
weighs on our mind and tempers the joy we feel today 
privately us officials said a key element of bushs statement 
was to applaud iran for humanitarian action a description 
also used by secretary of state james a baker iii the officials 
said iran after years of isolation from the west was seeking 
recognition for positive deeds 
even before reed was released by his captors a state department 
hostage reception team was dispatched to the us hospital at 
wiesbaden west germany to provide care and conduct debriefings 
preparations began after a previously unknown group the 
organization of islamic dawn said on sunday it would free reed 
within 48 hours 
in malden mass an overjoyed fifi reed got the word from the 
state department and said she would fly to germany to be with her 
husband 
reed director of the private lebanon international school had 
been seized sept 9 1986 
while asserting there had been no deals with the kidnappers 
spokesman fitzwater said weve had a number of discussions 
with syrian officials with third countries who have relations or 
have contacts with iran and people in lebanon 
weve had a lot of third party intermediary kinds of messages 
back and forth with iran but theres nothing we can point to in 
terms of any specific reasons for this release fitzwater said 
the americans still hostage in the middle east include terry 
anderson the chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press the longest held he has been captive for more than five 
years

president violeta barrios de chamorro 
said monday that gen humberto ortega will remain only temporarily 
as chief of the armed forces and that she would hold talks with 
contra rebels who refuse to disarm 
many contras balked at disarming after mrs chamorro named gen 
ortega brother of former sandinista president daniel ortega as 
the armed forces chief the move also drew criticism from many 
within the new presidents 14party coalition 
the presidents remarks at her first news conference since 
taking office five days ago were a clear attempt to ease tensions 
within the coalition 
the transition of power from the leftist sandinistas to mrs 
chamorros uno coalition followed nine years of a usbacked 
insurgency by the contras in which 30000 people died 
the inauguration of mrs chamorro a conservative elected in 
february brought immediate resumption of us aid and trade 
assistance 
at her news conference the president commented for the first 
time on austerity measures aimed at patching up the battered 
economy mrs chamorro said the sandinistas had left only 3 
million in the treasury and an 11 billion foreign debt 
that is why it is urgent that we apply severe measures that 
will allow us in the short term to stabilize the currency and 
prices to guarantee investment and the productive effort now that 
this years agricultural cycle is starting she said 
last week the cordoba nicaraguas currency was devalued by 
half sharply increasing prices and causing more hardship in an 
already poor country 
at the news conference mrs chamorro said the powerful secret 
police force which was run by the sandinista interior ministry 
would be abolished but she did not elaborate 
she also said a requirement that both nicaraguans and foreigners 
obtain exit visas to leave the country would be ended 
mrs chamorro also referred to differences with her vice 
president virgilio godoy who is out of the country on an 
unexplained trip he is engaged in bitter rivalry for influence and 
power with some of mrs chamorros close advisers 
i trust that the vice president will accompany and support 
me with the total loyalty in the taking of the great decisions and 
in the fulfillment of the complex tasks with which the people of 
nicaragua have entrusted us she said 
mrs chamorro faces two may day protest marches one by a 
sandinista labor union demanding 100 percent pay raises and the 
demobilization of contras and another by a bloc of four 
independent trade unions demanding gen ortega be removed 
i understand that in the case of the army the people and the 
political sectors that helped me and support me would like a 
drastic and immediate change she said but we need to do 
things well even if it means resuming temporary sacrifices to 
guarantee the tranquility and stability of the country 
contra military chief israel galeano is meeting with mrs 
chamorro on wednesday to discuss the rebels position the rebels 
had agreed to demobilize by june 10 but many have put off laying 
down their arms 
galeano has said he wants the sandinista peoples army 
dismantled or at the very least the departure of gen ortega 
and the top sandinista military officers 
the president said she had met several times with gen ortega 
and had told him the job was temporary he was being retained to 
ensure the unity and discipline of the army while the contras 
disarm she said 
the sandinistas say the army is protected by the constitution 
and any attempt to radically change it could result in violence 
while mrs chamorros united national opposition coalition has a 
majority in the national assembly it does not have enough votes 
there to change the constitution

protests broke out at french prisons monday 
for the third day in a row and the authorities said steps would be 
taken to reduce overcrowding and other problems 
in the northern city of douai about 50 disgruntled inmates 
scaled a jailhouse roof monday and brandished a 
skullandcrossbones flag police fired tear gas and the prisoners 
returned to their cells a similar rooftop protest had occurred at 
the prison sunday 
in nice on the french riviera about 150 inmates protested 
overcrowding at their prison by refusing to return to their cells 
following an afternoon exercise period monday they ended the 
twohour protest after presenting a list of demands to authorities 
the protests followed two days of rioting by 500 inmates at the 
loosleslille prison in this northern industrial city inmates 
burned a workshop and garage sacked 175 cells and hurled roof 
tiles at police causing an estimated 17 million in damage no 
serious injuries were reported 
prison investigators questioned inmates monday to determine who 
led the rioting they promised to uphold negotiators pledges that 
no general reprisals would be carried out 
pierre arpaillange the countrys top prison official blamed 
the riot on overcrowding at loosleslilles which was built for 
550 prisoners but holds 1000 the prison at nice reportedly holds 
900 inmates in a facility built for 280 
arpaillange told the rtl radio that new prisons for 13000 
inmates are to open by july 
the rebellions were the first in french prisons this year but 
there were at least 10 such revolts in 1989 a series of prison 
revolts in 1987 during an intense heat spell started at the 
loosleslille and douai facilities 
loosleslille is about 125 miles north of paris and 25 miles 
from douai 
officials said there is no overcrowding at douai where 540 
inmates are housed in a facility with a capacity for 575 
the demands of the loosleslille inmates were never made clear 
but officials said they centered on the slowness of the justice 
system and the parliamentary amnesty recently granted to a number 
of politicians in a fundraising scandal 
the douai prisoners were demanding better recreational 
facilities

house republicans backed away from president 
bushs 1991 budget on monday deciding to not force a house vote on 
what they now say is an outdated 12 trillion spending plan 
rep bill frenzel ranking republican on the house budget 
committee said he changed his mind about offering bushs package 
after talking with gop leaders 
republicans had planned to force the house to vote on the 
presidents proposal during debate scheduled for tuesday on a 
democratic alternative as they frequently have done in past years 
the reversal seems to indicate that many republicans would 
prefer to not have to vote for bushs plan 
theres a feeling among republicans that the budget has been 
passed by by economic and political events said frenzel rminn 
to debate it is a waste of time we have to do a real job based 
on the realities of the day 
since bush offered his budget in january the warsaw pact has 
deteriorated even further and the us economy has seemed to 
hesitate 
bushs 3037 billion defense proposal has been criticized by 
democrats and some republicans as unneccessarily high the 
democrats want to spend 2954 billion 
and even bushs plan understates the amount of deficit reduction 
that will be needed to satisfy the grammrudman balancedbudget 
law to meet that laws target of a maximum 64 billion shortfall 
next year darman has said that at least 45 billion in savings 
will be needed rather than the 37 billion bush has proposed 
the democratic plan also proposes 37 billion in spending cuts 
and new revenues 
republicans had always expected that the presidents proposal 
would be a loser in the house where democrats prevail 258176 
but they had until now planned to offer it anyway they saw it 
as a rallying point and as a gop bargaining position in what they 
hope will be negotiations between the white house and congressional 
leaders 
it is embarrassing said frenzel of the change of plans 
but he added i didnt want to go ahead against large numbers 
of people in our caucus referring to house republicans 
white house spokesman stephen hart said he would not comment on 
the house gop decision 
senate republicans decided weeks ago to not offer bushs plan as 
that chambers budget panel tries to work out a 1991 spending 
package

connecticut on monday became the first 
state to give women the legal right to abortion in a law intended 
to stand even if the supreme court reverses its 1973 decision 
legalizing abortion 
the roe vs wade decision said states cannot ban abortions but 
if the ruling were struck down states would then be able to make 
abortion illegal 
without ceremony democratic gov william a oneill a roman 
catholic who personally opposes abortion signed the bill into law 
monday afternoon it takes effect oct 1 
the bill cleared the state senate on friday 323 and the house 
the week before 13612 it repeals the states unenforced criminal 
antiabortion statutes requires women under 16 to be counseled 
before getting an abortion and encourages them to tell their 
parents 
in a variation on the supreme courts roe vs wade ruling the 
new law allows abortions late in pregnancy when the fetus is 
capable of living outside the womb only when the life or health of 
the mother is in danger 
i believe this measure strikes a balance between a persons 
right to privacy and state interests the governor said in a news 
release 
it recognizes a right to choice by women the law also 
recognizes the state has an interest in fetus viability and 
properly recognizes that minors should be counseled before making 
the very difficult decision to abort a pregnancy oneill said 
when the bill passed the house betty gallo a lobbyist for the 
connecticut coalition for choice called it the most aggressive 
prochoice piece of legislation since webster she referred to 
the supreme courts decision last summer in webster vs 
reproductive health services that gave states greater power to 
restrict abortions 
connecticuts antiabortion laws were rendered unenforceable by 
roe vs wade they carried penalties of up to five years in prison 
and a 1000 fine for anyone performing an abortion and two years 
in prison and a 500 fine for women getting abortions except to 
protect the life of the mother 
state rep nancy wyman one of several democrats who crafted the 
bill said oneill with his personal opposition to abortion made 
a difficult decision 
i know that its not truly with his conscience said wyman 
hes doing something that is good for the women of connecticut 
kate michelman of the national abortion rights league said she 
could count on one hand the number of other states where 
similar legislation could pass 
you have to have a prochoice legislature and you have to have 
a governor who is prochoice who understands that women not 
politicians should make this decision she said in a telephone 
interview from washington 
today gov oneill has shown his utmost respect for the women 
of his state hes shown that he trusts the women of his state to 
make their own personal and private decisions about abortion 
new hampshire gov judd gregg vetoed a similar bill earlier this 
year describing it as too liberal 
meanwhile the states leading antiabortion group the prolife 
council of connecticut continued to describe the bill as a success 
because of its provisions on counseling and fetus viability 
at a news conference the group announced the formation of a 
team of prolife lawyers that will work to ensure portions of the 
law are enforced particularly the counseling of minor girls on 
options other than abortion 
this whole thing for us has been a major breakthrough because 
before we had nothing said regina smith the executive director 
of the council 
more strident antiabortion activists were more critical of the 
bill 
prolife not only didnt get anything we are in a far worse 
position than we were before said state rep anthony nania a 
conservative who voted against the bill and has called for smiths 
ouster 
to say that there are new restrictions on abortion flies in 
the face of the facts 
when the bill passed the house betty gallo a lobbyist for the 
connecticut coalition for choice called it the most aggressive 
prochoice piece of legislation since webster

gov bill clements said monday he would 
veto a bill that would increase the state sales tax by half a cent 
and pay for a courtordered school finance reform plan 
that set off picketing by teachers at the governors mansion 
i think teachers are very angry and very upset and very 
frustrated said john cole president of the texas federation of 
teachers whose group organized the march that drew about 300 
the reform bill has loomed over the states education system 
since the state supreme court ruled last year that financing of the 
135 billion school system must change the state comptroller 
threatened monday to freeze state education spending at midnight 
the legislature is expected to send clements the bill on 
tuesday the deadline set by the high court ruling the measure 
would put a 555 million finance plan into effect 
but clements who is retiring is against increasing taxes and 
wants to reallocate funds to pay for a lessexpensive reform plan 
a combination of state and federal aid and local property taxes now 
pay for state education 
i am going to veto the bill just like i said i would 
clements said in dallas he said he would summon legislators 
wednesday into a third special session on education to find a 
solution 
the republican governor was out of town when teachers gathered 
at his residence to protest the failure by him and the 
democraticcontrolled legislature to reach agreement on how to pay 
for the reform 
clyde hemminger a sixthgrade social studies teacher from fort 
worth shook the locked iron gates and said of clements hes 
obviously locked the doors to the mansion wed like to keep the 
doors to the schoolhouse open 
many of the signs brandished by the protesting teachers attacked 
clements veto promise 
hey bill exercise your mind not your pen said one sign a 
reference to the governors remark earlier in the day that by 
marching the teachers will get a lot of good exercise 
on oct 2 the court ruled the states finance system was unfair 
to propertypoor school districts and ordered the legislature to 
overhaul the system 
state officials will appear tuesday before state district judge 
scott mccown who is overseeing the case to explain why no reforms 
were approved before the deadline 
the expected veto has raised the ire of teachers cole said 
they have been observing officials of the state of texas 
treating education something that teachers feel very fervently 
about as though it were a political game and using the students 
and the school employees as pawns in that game 
if students acted like this we would be giving them fs and 
sending notes home to their parents he said 
the high court has threatened to stop state aid if a reform plan 
does not go into effect by tuesday comptroller bob bullock said he 
would freeze state education expenses including nearly 27 
million in salaries for more than 1000 texas education agency 
employees unless the judge intercedes 
at the stroke of midnight state funding for public 
education stops unless the governor has signed the bills passed by 
the legislature he said 
but clements citing 400 million sent to schools last wednesday 
in april state aid payments said there was enough money to pay 
teachers 
we dont really have a problem clements said we have 
ample funds and the funds are in hand to pay the teachers until i 
believe its the last two days of the school year 
the texas federation of teachers and the texas classroom 
teachers association said they want mccown to allow the state to 
send school districts enough money to pay teachers failing that 
they want teachers to be released from employment contracts in 
districts lacking enough local money to pay them 
it wouldnt be a strike it would be like a lockout we are 
not advocating a walkout at this point cole said 
strikes walkouts all those things damage children they 
dont damage governors and legislators said jeri stone 
executive director of the union

shootout on a houston freeway after a night of drinking among 
offduty officers 
alex gonzales 25 was convicted friday of voluntary 
manslaughter in the case which became a cause for groups that 
maintain houston police are hostile to blacks 
blacks and other community leaders said they did not think an 
allwhite jury would convict the gonzales 
trial in the death of ida lee delaney a janitor at the houston 
post was moved to dallas because of heavy news coverage in houston 
attorneys for gonzales planned an appeal 
a community activist who has monitored the case said she 
believed most observers would consider the verdict fair 
obviously there was enough information and evidence to bring 
some form of justice and that was critical in my opinion said

the system in they were able to find it 
tests after the shooting showed gonzales had a bloodalcohol 
level of 19 nearly twice the amount to be considered legally 
drunk in texas

offduty officers before they chased her on a houston freeway for 
12 miles early on oct 31 1989

truck over to the side of the road apparently seeking help ms 
delaney fired at gonzales after he ran to her truck gun in hand 
and punched her in the face witnesses testified though wounded 
he returned fire killing her 
the jury spent most of the day monday determining the sentence 
gonzales could have been sentenced to up to 20 years in prison 
gonzales and the two other officers alexander romero and robert 
gonzales who is unrelated were fired by former houston police 
chief lee brown all three have appealed their firings

president bush announced his nomination of the 
firstever panamanian to manage the panama canal as he told that 
nations new president on monday that the united states will 
stand with you in peace 
bush in his first meeting with president guillermo endara since 
the us invasion of panama last december also voiced support for 
endaras proposal to speed up a study on the feasibility of 
widening the 86yearold waterway 
but saying the struggle is not over in panama bush 
chastised congress for not moving quicker on his 800 million aid 
package for panama and nicaragua the measure has been delayed in 
the senate behind a long list of unrelated amendments 
one snag a dispute over abortion and the death penalty in the 
district of columbia was cleared away late monday when senators 
agreed on a voice vote to include both provisions in the bill and 
work out the issues in a housesenate conference committee later 
the accepted language would allow use of dc funds to pay for 
abortions for poor women and permit the death penalty for 
drugrelated murders in the district 
but if the abortion provision remains in the bill bush has said 
he would veto it which would lead to further delay 
ive asked and asked again that our aid package to the newly 
liberated people of panama be passed and passed swiftly and still 
it waits and with it the future of the fledgling democracy said 
bush endara at his side after the two leaders met for 2 hours 
endara was installed as president last dec 20 by us invasion 
forces who toppled the government of strongman manuel antonio 
noriega 
endara speaking in spanish said his people had suffered 
under 21 long years but that tyrannies of any kind of any 
sort must be relegated to the past 
then addressing bush directly in english endara thanked him 
for filling our spirits with enthusiasm and optimism he 
invited bush to visit panama as soon as possible 
be careful i might just show up bush said 
in a departure ceremony bush praised endara as a consensus 
builder who won the confidence of panamanians and all 
americans 
the president used the occasion to announce he was sending to 
the senate under terms of the 1978 panama canal treaties the 
nomination of gilberto guardia fabrega to be panama canal 
commission administrator 
the treaties called for a panamanian selected by panama 
nominated by the us president and confirmed by the us senate 
to be put in charge of the canal in the final decade of us 
jurisdiction 
the canal will be turned over to panama in the year 2000 
last year bush balked at a noriega choice for canal 
administrator and refused to send a name to the senate the present 
administrator dennis p mcauliffe is an american 
guardia 60 is the president of an architectural and 
engineering company in panama city educated at santa clara 
university in california guardia was a civil engineer with the 
panama canal company in the 1950s 
endara praised bushs endorsement of guardia as canal 
administrator as an act of justice 
bush and endara also signed four agreements three on drugwar 
cooperation and the other to allow peace corps volunteers back into 
the isthmus nation 
panama a nation newly reborn in liberty can count on the 
support of the united states of america we were with you in times 
of conflict and we will stand with you in peace bush said 
both in his comments with endara and in remarks earlier monday 
to the annual convention of the us chamber of commerce bush 
accused congress of dragging its feet on his central american aid 
package 
bush complained that his package of aid to panama and nicaragua 
had become weighed down by adding another 800 million in 
unrelated spending in the house and with a contentious abortion 
provision in the senate 
bush asked congress last march 13 for the 800 million package 
500 million for panama and 300 for nicaragua the senate trimmed 
the panama part of the package to 420 million 
it is embarrassing that the aid still hasnt won passage 
bush told the chamber of commerce audience nicaragua and panama 
quite simply need this aid and weve got to deliver 
no wonder the american people get so frustrated with the way 
the congress operates he added 
assistant secretary of state bernard aronson told a news 
conference that bush endorsed endaras proposal that a 
uspanamajapan study on widening the panama canal halted under 
noriegas regime go forward and produce its recommendations 
within five years 
of the three new drug agreements one would allow the us 
military to board panamanianflag vessels suspected of carrying 
narcotics another seeks to regulate chemical substances used for 
illicit drugs and the third would permit the us coast guard to 
enter panamanian territorial waters under specified circumstances

chinese authorities lifted martial law on tuesday 
in the tibetan capital of lhasa nearly 14 months after the 
restrictions were imposed to quell bloody nationalist rioting 
china said social order had been restored 
the official xinhua news agency said martial law imposed march 
8 1989 after three days of antichinese rioting officially ended 
on orders of premier li peng 
in view of the fact that the situation in lhasa has become 
stable and social order has returned to normal the task of 
enforcing martial law in the city has been successfully 
fulfilled said a cabinet order signed by li 
xinhua said peoples liberation army troops were ordered to 
leave their posts around the jokhang temple buddhist tibets 
holiest shrine and a flashpoint for antigovernment demonstrations 
at midnight monday 
troops have manned checkpoints on main roads leading into the 
temple and maintained sentries around the barkhor square that 
encompasses the temple 
it is likely that the army and the paramilitary peoples armed 
police will continue to be deployed in large numbers around the 
city 
antichinese proindependence sentiments remain high in lhasa 
xinhua warned monday that separatists on both sides of the border 
are still plotting to continue their separatist and destructive 
activities we absolutely cannot relax our vigilance 
the government said 16 people were killed and more than 100 
wounded in last years riots tibetan and foreign sources said 
about 30 died 
altogether tibetans say about 70 people have died in clashes 
with police and soldiers in the past three years 
the rioting was the bloodiest in tibet since a failed 1959 
uprising and marked the first time martial law was announced in 
china since the 196676 cultural revolution when radical leftists 
tried to purge china of bourgeois influence 
the riots began march 5 when tibetans carrying banners marched 
around jokhang temple chinese police opened fire 
angry crowds began stoning police and went on a threeday 
rampage burning chinese shops and attacking chinese passersby 
police responded with more gunfire and tear gas 
tibetans spoke of hundreds of arrests after the march riots but 
chinas official media reported only 20 people being sentenced 
some receiving life prison terms and others a few years 
during martial law the military presence in lhasa normally 
high was stepped up further with soldiers or paramilitary 
officers stationed at intersections most reporters were barred 
from the city tourism was tightly restricted 
nonetheless reports of several small nationalist protests have 
filtered out to be routinely denied by the chinese 
most recently a monitoring group in london the tibet 
information network said chinese authorities expelled several 
buddhist monks and nuns from religious institutions and hundreds of 
monks left their monasteries in protest 
most monks and nuns remain loyal to the dalai lama their exiled 
religious leader and once tibets secular ruler they have been at 
the forefront of most independence demonstrations in recent years 
and were forced to undergo political education during martial law 
china has said the dalai lama who won the 1989 nobel peace 
prize for his peaceful resistance to chinese rule can return only 
if he gives up his proposal for tibetan autonomy he fled to india 
in 1959 
china says its sovereignty over tibet dates back to the 13th 
century when a chinese princess married a tibetan ruler 
however many tibetans say chinese rule was sporadic and that 
for many years tibetans had their own theocratic government flag 
and currency tibetans speak a different language and they are 
culturally distinct from chinese

an electronic darkroom system designed by the 
associated press to replace its current network of photo receivers 
is on schedule and meeting preproduction testing goals ap 
president and general manager louis d boccardi told the annual 
meeting of the news cooperative 
boccardi told publishers and editors representing the aps 1486 
newspaper members on april 23 that fullscale installation of the 
ap leaf darkroom is to begin in september after summer 
fieldtesting an installation schedule is to be announced in june 
because installation of the darkroom will mean conversion to 
satellite delivery the schedule will be driven by where ap can 
achieve the biggest savings in landline costs to help pay for the 
project boccardi said 
he said a joint committee of member photo editors and production 
executives would be announced within two weeks to advise the ap on 
the rollout of the darkroom program bill rinehart the 
justretired anpa vice president for technical matters will serve 
on the panel 
boccardi compared the new technology for electronic handling of 
photos to the computer terminal revolution in handling words he 
said it will mark a major step forward for newspapers 
we will train your staff and aps service reliability will 
stand behind the ap leaf darkroom it is the right step at the 
right time boccardi said 
he noted that darkrooms from sources other than ap could be used 
with the ap leaf which will fully conform to anpa standards 
other technological advancements are imminent boccardi added 
by july 1 the ap expects to complete the conversion of its 
entire highspeed system to deliver copy to members at 9000 words a 
minute 
a customized stocks service that allows members to localize 
market table pages is in print in a dozen member newspapers and 
the installation schedule for selectstocks will be accelerated 
through the rest of the year 
boccardi also touched on the plight of terry anderson chief 
middle east correspondent who was taken hostage in lebanon five 
years ago last month 
we continue to search for an end to his ordeal and pray that 
recent optimistic comments will lead to his release boccardi 
said

mexican president carlos salinas de gortari 
speaking at the annual luncheon of the associated press on april 
23 denounced the alleged us kidnapping of a mexican doctor to 
face charges in the slaying of a narcotics agent 
salinas pointed to mexican arrests and convictions of 28 
defendants in the 1985 slaying of us drug agent enrique camarena 
as proof that mexico needs no help in apprehending the guilty 
dr humberto alvarez machain who was brought to el paso texas 
on april 3 from guadalajara mexico is one of 18 people under 
indictment in the camarena murder 
 
a federal judge in los angeles has demanded an explanation of 
how alvarez came to the united states if the doctor was kidnapped 
salinas said the incident could undermine the international 
drugfighting effort 
this runs the risk of creating illegal habits among those who 
have the obligation of defending the law and could create a problem 
much larger than the one we are trying to combat salinas said 
 
the mexican government has complained about the arrest of the 
gynecologist alleging the us drug enforcement administration 
offered money for the kidnapping and may have been in on the actual 
plot 
alvarez is alleged to have been present when camarena was 
tortured and murdered at a guadalajara house prosecutors allege 
that the doctor gave camarena drugs to revive him for additional 
torturing before he was killed

an advertising consultant told the american 
newspaper publishers association on april 24 that papers should 
adopt a more local focus because issues such as the push for 
independence in lithuania wont sell ads 
at the associations 104th annual convention the nations 
newspaper publishers also discussed declining readership 
telecommunications developments affecting papers and recycling of 
newsprint 
the only specialized thing about a newspaper is its 
locality said laurel cutler vice chairman of fcbleber katz 
partners and vice president of consumer affairs for the chrysler 
corp 
frank a daniels jr president and publisher of the news amp 
observer of raleigh nc said a newspaper traditionally has 
been a smorgasbord you have something in there for everybody 
but ms cutler warned against newspapers trying to be all 
things to all people and suggested specialization was more 
appealing to advertisers 
the more generalized the more all things to all people the 
less we care about you she said 
the comments came during a panel discussion called ozzie and 
harriet are gone who do you think youre writing for 
virginia dodge fielder vice president of research for 
knightridder inc expressed industry frustration in trying to 
pinpoint the cause of declining readership 
i wish people hated us more she said i wish they 
expressed more dissatisfaction because if they did wed know how to 
tackle it what the public is saying is not i hate you but i 
dont need you youre a great electric company but i live in an 
allgas house 
one publisher said the industry may be close to winning a 
6yearold fight with the bell companies over who can transmit 
electronic information in the future 
robert m johnson publisher president andchief executive 
officer of newsday inc of melville ny reported that congress 
is likely to pass a bill soon setting a telecommunications public 
policy 
he said the bell companies have set aside a 25 million war 
chest to fight for the right to publish information on its 
electronic circuits he said bell seeks to launch an electronic 
yellow pages that would compete directly with newspaper 
advertising 
such actions would violate a 1984 federal court decision that 
set out the principle of diversity in dividing atampt into separate 
companies he said 
citing antitrust laws us district judge harold greene held 
that those who control telecommunication lines should not also 
control the information that goes over those lines johnson said 
johnson said that in the past year a task force of the anpa has 
worked with congress on legislation addressing the issue a draft 
bill was produced but has not yet been passed an appeal of the 
original federal order has sent that back to greene for 
reconsideration 
the chairman of the anpas newsprint resource task force said 
publishers should move quickly to recycle newsprint to keep the 
government from imposing regulations 
frank a bennack jr president and chief executive officer of 
the hearst corp new york said publishers have resolved to double 
the amount of recycled newsprint used in the coming year reaching 
a total of 46 million tons 
we believe efforts to control newsprint can mean efforts to 
control the press he said the prospect of dealing with a 
regulated newsprint industry calls up an array of terrifying 
unknowns 
bennack said that at least two states have already mandated that 
newspapers use recycled newsprint but he insisted such official 
orders will be unnecessary if publishers act on the recycling issue 
voluntarily

the st louis sun folded april 25 ending a 
sevenmonth struggle to become the countrys first bigcity 
newspaper to make a profitable launch since world war ii 
it is clear that we could not achieve sufficient circulation 
to make this enterprise viable and so we have concluded that there 
is no longer room in st louis for the sun said ralph ingersoll 
ii editor in chief 
with a circulation of about 100000 the sevenday morning 
tabloid never threatened the st louis postdispatchs circulation 
of 375000 daily and 565000 on sunday but it did manage to 
generate a fair share of controversy 
the sun was accused of sensationalism for its coverage of a 
politician involved in a sexual assault and of the fiveyear 
anniversary of an accident in which a man was nearly sawed in two 
the newspaper also was chided for running photos of revealing 
womens swimsuits and lingerie some critics derided its flood of 
promotions fluorescent green billboards and contests 
but the sun was praised for its coverage of the effort to build 
a new domed stadium downtown and of the troubles facing st louis 
major air carrier trans world airlines 
ingersoll is chairman and chief executive of ingersoll 
publications co and has an interest in four other newspaper 
holding companies he said his new tabloid needed to sell most of 
its copies from vending boxes and newsracks 
instead it ended up with homedelivery sales outnumbering 
singlecopy sales 2to1 
that cost the paper which spent more than 25 million to start 
up an unexpected 5 million home delivery costs are higher 
because of the expenses of billing customers and hiring delivery 
people 
the sudden death did not surprise everyone 
they read the handwriting on the wall the weather was 
good the cardinals were playing the blues were playing and people 
still werent buying the paper you dont have to be a brain 
surgeon to figure it out said kevin horrigan a columnist who 
jumped ship from the st louis postdispatch to join the sun 
in horrigans old newsroom postdispatch editor william woo 
said he was sorry about the demise of the sun the sun undertook 
a difficult mission and made a valiant effort which fell short 
woo said 
ingersoll said he didnt know how much money overall he had lost 
on the sun he said the decision to close had nothing to do with 
debt problems at another of his newspaper companies 
i emphasize the sole reason the st louis sun did not succeed 
was the inability to generate adequate singlecopy sales he said 
on april 20 an offer by ingersoll to buy back much of the 240 
million of junk bonds issued by his community newspapers inc 
failed to attract a single bondholder if the company cant agree 
with bondholders on a buyback it could be forced to more than 
double the interest rate on some of the bonds to more than 26 
percent 
the st louis sun was owned by ingersoll newspapers inc which 
also owns 77 other newspapers in seven states 
when he launched the sun in september ingersoll said he wanted 
to prove that new newspapers if properly designed and promoted 
could be introduced in the united states just as they had been in 
other countries 
he said he was planning to move to st louis and would 
personally direct the papers launch he spent many late nights in 
its hightech newsroom learning about sophisticated equipment and 
refining the papers look 
im disappointed i feel that we gave it our very best shot 
he said

like the entire newspaper industry 
gannett co inc is mired in a recession that began in the second 
half of 1989 chairman john j curley told shareholders april 26 
gannett whose profits grew along with its increasing size for 
22 consecutive years since it became a publicly traded company 
managed to report an up quarter but barely in its 
firstquarter earnings report curley said 
curleys comments were made after the american newspaper 
publishers association meeting at which news executives discussed 
the general drop in advertising revenues and an accompanying 
decline in readership 
gannett has suffered from the downturn in advertising that 
started in the northeast spread to the south and has not yet 
reached the west coast company officials said they were cautious 
about prospects for their papers including usa today 
still they said they expect usa today to turn profitable for 
the first time in 1990 they also said usa weekend is approaching 
profitability and now carries more ads than its main competitor 
parade magazine 
but curley cautioned we wont really know about the retail 
climate until we find out what happens in may and june 
he noted that gannetts stock price rose along with the fortunes 
of the company in the first half of 1989 then fell when the 
newspaper business turned down in mid1989 
trustees of the gannett foundation whose sole asset is 10 
percent of the companys stock said april 25 they would put the 
block up for sale because internal revenue service rules forced 
them to consider diversifying their holdings the charitable trust 
is headed by former gannett chairman allen h neuharth 
the foundations 15940185 shares of stock were worth about 
566 million last week the foundation said that at times the 
shares have been worth as much as 900 million 
through a spokesman neuharth declined to comment on a 
washington post story that said the proposed sale may indicate a 
rift between neuharth and executives who have run the company since 
he left as chairman in march 1989 
curley gave up using limousines and the corporate suites 
neuharth had rented in new york and washington and the post said 
neuharth was upset by comments of gannett executives criticizing 
his lifestyle while chairman as excessive and wasteful 
curley also declined to comment through his spokeswoman sheila 
gibbons although she said of the post story i think thats 
overreaching 
much of the shareholders meeting was devoted to descriptions of 
how gannett is trying to develop new products as americans find 
less time to read and show less inclination to do so 
such strategies include buying the city magazine in rockford 
ill where gannett publishes the register star newspaper to 
increase our already strong information and ad picture said gary 
l watson president of gannetts community newspaper division 
he said gannett might buy other such magazines 
watson and other gannett officials also described how the 
company had 
published a talking phone book in florida with access to 
news weather sports and other information at a tollfree number 
put out advertising guides to luxury real estate also in 
florida 
started upscale lifestyle supplements to attract advertisers in 
new jersey and florida 
published a guide with pacific northwest tourist information to 
be distributed on ferries that sail from washington state to alaska 
run specials on its television stations built around special 
sections in usa today

times mirror corp said april 25 its 
firstquarter profit fell 33 percent largely because of an 
advertising slowdown that hit its northeastern newspapers consumer 
magazines and broadcast tv operations 
for the quarter ending april 1 times mirrors earnings fell to 
46 million or 36 cents per share down from 688 million or 53 
cents per share a year earlier 
revenues rose 33 percent to 8752 million from 8469 million 
but times mirror said its slide in earnings was partly 
attributable to higher promotional costs and higher circulation 
that pushed up operating costs at the los angeles times 
although our professional publishing and cable television 
operations achieved solid earnings growth during the quarter their 
performance only partially offset the marked deterioration in our 
newspaper publishing segment said robert f erburu times 
mirrors chairman and chief executive 
ad volume was slow at the northeastern newspapers with newsday 
and new york newsday suffering from a depressed new york economy 
times mirror said the 1990 first quarter also had one less sunday 
than the yearearlier period which reduced revenues 
despite increased revenues at the los angeles times a surge in 
circulation increased operating costs contributing to a 38 percent 
decline in operating profit from newspapers 
times mirror said its companywide circulation as reported to 
the audit bureau of circulations but not yet verified rose 41 
percent for the daily papers and 32 percent on sunday over the 
past six months 
at the los angeles times daily circulation during the same 
period rose by 81 percent to 1210077 with sunday circulation up 
57 percent to 1504540 the company said publisher and chief 
executive officer david laventhol estimated half the increase was 
from former readers of the nowclosed herald examiner 
new york newsday grew by 116 percent to 217514 daily 
circulation during the six months and the hartford conn courant 
reported a 22 percent rise to 230358 the company said 
although consumer magazines also were affected by the 
advertising slowdown the book magazine and other publishing 
segment still had a 136 percent increase in quarterly revenues and 
217 percent growth in operating profit as a result of gains by the 
legal publishing flight information and training businesses

dave lyons remembers the glory days in 
odessa texas when the oil boom brought roustabouts and rig 
workers to west texas and the circulation of his newspaper the 
odessa american shot skyward 
they were bluecollar workers but they were sophisticated 
he said they were world traveled some of them had served 
overseas in saudi arabia or libya 
they were people who read newspapers 
now many of the oil people are gone and like other texas 
papers the odessa american is struggling back from a precipitous 
tumble in readership and advertising 
texas papers are not alone odessas story was typical of tales 
of woe told last week at the american newspaper publishers 
associations 104th convention a gathering that annually takes the 
pulse of the us newspaper industry 
this year the pulse was slower than ever and the prognosis for 
the patients future was anybodys guess was the problem a 
recurring depression or something more lifethreatening a 
transfusion of advertising would help all agreed a healthier 
readership was advised 
the odessa american a member of the freedom newspapers group 
with a circulation of 38000 is bouncing back lyons said due to 
aggressive changes those include conversion from an afternoon to a 
morning paper and a heavy focus on local sports to attract 
notoriously indifferent younger readers 
since 1986 weve lost about 20 percent of circulation 
lyons said but that was because we lost population our home 
county had a population of 144000 before the oil bust now the 
population is 116000 
these days every time i see an obituary for a person over 50 
i think oh no there goes another subscriber lyons said 
advertising the lifeblood of newspapers has been draining away 
at an alarming rate all over the country in the worst slump since 
the 1970s advertising was down 28 percent in 1989 from a year 
earlier according to leading national advertisers a firm that 
tracks newspaper ad revenue 
in the first quarter of 1990 even the normally robust times 
mirror co reported a 33 percent fall in net income the drop was 
blamed on a soft ad market particularly for the companys east 
coast newspapers 
times mirrors flagship paper the los angeles times announced 
a dramatic circulation climb of 95 percent to an alltime high of 
1225189 daily buoyed by readers from the los angeles herald 
examiner which folded in november but the times advertising 
revenue was down about 2 percent 
ironically the financial news that fills newspaper business 
pages has had a boomerang effect striking the messengers in the 
pocketbook acquisitions mergers store closures and a falling 
real estate market mean decreased advertising 
classified pages the newspapers financial backbone shrank as 
ads for automobiles real estate and helpwanted declined 
the question is whether its cyclical or not said john j 
curley chairman of gannett co which owns more dailies than any 
other group we honestly dont know 
in its firstquarter report issued last week gannett profits 
rose by only the narrowest of margins from 749 million a year 
ago to 75 million this year 
curley sees the newspaper recession as regional rather than 
nationwide he linked it to last winters bankruptcy protection 
filing by the campeau corp the torontobased conglomerate that 
controlled some of this countrys bestknown retail stores 
including bloomingdales jordan marsh lazarus and abraham amp 
straus 
west is best curley said noting that the southwest 
recovering from the oil crisis is doing well northwest is 
secondbest midwest is more down than out southeast is mostly 
down thats retail related northeast is worst with automotive 
ads a big factor 
craig standen president of the newspaper advertising bureau an 
arm of anpa stressed that newspapers arent the only mediarelated 
companies suffering 
the whole media market the advertising business is not going 
as fast as it has in the past he said yes its a problem for 
newspapers but i dont think it means something is structurally 
wrong with newspapers 
declining readership was the other major problem troubling 
publishers it was the topic of panel discussions speeches and 
workshops poor education was denounced more literacy was demanded 
a note of hope was sounded by steven l isenberg associate 
publisher of newsday who said that in spite of a general economic 
downturn new york remains a bastion of newspaper readers 
in new york city the number of people who read two or more 
papers a day is remarkable he said adding opinion is the 
mothers milk of new york life we give them columnists with 
different opinions and views and they come back with a real 
signature of daily life 
isenberg warned that while newspapers are besieged with 
financial woes they shouldnt forget their underlying purpose 
newspapers are part of helping us to be intelligent citizens 
he said 
we are an engine of democracy and we have a responsibility to 
the whole community said c shelby coffey iii editor and 
executive vice president of the los angeles times 
i think newspapers are central to the survival of a free 
society said john e cox jr president of the foundation for 
american communications 
their statements could be taken as an echo of the enthusiastic 
standing ovation the 1600 anpa members gave to two special guests 
the publishers of a bogota colombia newspaper that fought that 
countrys drug lords and managed to publish after its plant was 
bombed no mention was made of the papers advertising and 
circulation numbers

consumer advocates attorneys and journalists 
say court agreements that allow companies to keep information about 
potential hazards involving their products secret are endangering 
lives and public safety 
however corporate lawyers argue that such arrangements are a 
legitimate part of the civil justice system offer an alternative 
to lengthy court battles and help protect trade secrets of us 
businesses and american competitiveness 
secrecy buries critical facts and the public good is 
ignored and damaged russ herman president of the association of 
trial lawyers of america said april 25 at a conference on secrecy 
sponsored by his group 
information discovered during product liability litigation 
ought to be made available to the public so the danger isnt 
repeated over and over again he added 
in many instances that includes documents and decisions 
involving unsafe products dangerous drugs toxic wastes all with 
potentially devastating effect on people unaware of the danger 
said paul mcmasters deputy editorial director of usa today 
mcmaster heads the freedom of information committee of the 
society of professional journalists cosponsor of the conference 
protective orders confidentiality agreements or court sealing 
of files in product liability cases prohibit lawsuit participants 
from distributing any of the information obtained limit what can 
be shared with others not involved in the lawsuit or make all 
records in a case unavailable 
one corporate defense attorney said that opening court records 
could violate privacy by revealing sensitive information about 
businesses or individuals 
if you can summons my medical records from my doctor my diary 
from my psychiatrist or records of design from a company 
privacy goes out the window said james morris iii a virginia 
lawyer 
opponents to secrecy should not be allowed to use the court 
system to disseminate information that might not otherwise be 
available morris said

the supreme court on april 24 grappled with an 
important libel law issue contained in a former high school 
wrestling coachs 15yearold lawsuit against an ohio newspaper 
the court is being asked to decide whether the constitutions 
freespeech protections immunize all expressions of opinion as 
opposed to assertions of fact from libel lawsuits 
first however the justices may have to tell judges nationwide 
how to distinguish fact from opinion 
the factopinion distinction is important courts traditionally 
have barred libel suits over expressions of opinion even though the 
high court never has said explicitly that such protection is 
constitutionally required 
the justices spent much of the april 24 session trying to figure 
out whether to put a fact or opinion tag on a 1975 sports 
column that accused michael milkovich of lying under oath 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justices antonin scalia 
and anthony m kennedy asked the most questions all three seemed 
to consider the statement at the heart of the suit to be an 
assertion of fact 
questions from justices john paul stevens sandra day oconnor 
and byron r white were more difficult to characterize justices 
william j brennan thurgood marshall and harry a blackmun asked 
no questions 
the column was written by ted diadiun and appeared in the news 
herald of lake county published by the lorain journal co 
milkovich was coaching maple heights high schools wrestling 
team at a 1974 home meet against mentor high school when a melee 
involving both teams and spectators erupted several wrestlers were 
hospitalized 
diadiun who was at the meet wrote several articles criticizing 
milkovichs conduct 
in a jan 8 1975 column diadiun accused the coach and h don 
scott then superintendent of the maple heights public schools of 
lying to a judge who overturned disciplinary measures against the 
maple heights team 
during extensive litigation milkovich won two preliminary 
rounds before the ohio supreme court in a 1984 decision the state 
court ruled that diadiuns statements about milkovich were reported 
as fact not opinion 
but in ruling on scotts related libel suit two years later the 
ohio supreme court reversed its 1984 ruling and said diadiuns 
statements were expressions of his opinion 
in an unusual move the ohio court used its aug 6 1986 
decision in scotts case to doom as well milkovichs suit against 
the newspaper and diadiun 
holding up a 1975 headline that said milkovich beat the law 
with the big lie milkovich attorney brent english of cleveland 
told the justices this is quintessentially an assertion of 
fact 
but richard panza of lorain ohio argued for the newspaper and 
diadiun that when people read sports columns they expect to read 
opinion 
gusts of laughter filled the courtroom after justice kennedy 
responded i gave up reading sports columns because theres 
nothing but legal news in them 
panzas most persistent interrogator was justice scalia who at 
one point asked him doesnt it trouble you that peoples 
reputations can be destroyed this way 
panza said yes it does trouble me he then quickly added 
that the column at issue was not libelous 
diadiun 42 and now an editor with the plain dealer in 
cleveland watched the session from the courtrooms press section 
milkovich 68 and recovering from triple bypass heart surgery 
did not attend in a recent interview he told the new york times 
he was too weak to make the trip from his maple heights home 
a decision is expected by july 
the case is milkovich vs lorain journal co 89645

a libel case stemming from a pulitzer 
prizewinning series on improprieties in college athletics was 
reinstated april 26 against the lexington heraldleader by the 
kentucky supreme court 
the court ruled that reggie warford a former assistant 
basketball coach at the university of pittsburgh was not a public 
figure and did not have to prove the newspaper printed the story 
maliciously 
warford was accused in the articles of offering money to a 
recruit and has been out of coaching work since the series was 
published his lawyer said 
hes tried but the stigma that has been attached to him its 
almost like a blackball in his profession attorney larry roberts 
said 
warford has held a series of parttime jobs in the pittsburgh 
area including as a juvenile probation officer and in a sporting 
goods store roberts said 
heraldleader editor john carroll said he disagreed with the 
courts ruling and feared it would have a chilling effect on 
freedom of speech in kentucky carroll said the newspaper would 
likely ask for a review of the ruling possibly by the us supreme 
court 
the newspaper reported that warford offered to split an expected 
raise with steve miller a highly sought high school player in 
lexington if miller would attend pittsburgh miller enrolled at 
western kentucky university 
the allegation was first published in the fall of 1985 and again 
in 1986 in a special edition entitled 1985 a year of crisis in 
college athletics it is the reprint which was sent to all ncaa 
member schools and coaches that is at the heart of the libel 
action 
miller retracted his statement after the first publication but 
the retraction was not included in the reprint the court ruling 
said warfords denial of any improper offer was included in the 
reports 
the courts opinion by justice joseph lambert said conclusive 
evidence was offered during the first trial that little attempt was 
made to verify millers story 
the opinion noted that the reporters knew of the allegation for 
months but did not contact warford until just before the first 
publication from the foregoing a jury could reasonably believe 
that they were committed to running the story without regard to 
its truth or falsity lambert said 
the newspaper won in a judges directed verdict when the case 
went to trial on the basis that warford had been a public figure 
during warfords appeal the newspaper said there was an ongoing 
public debate about recruiting violations in college athletics 
warfords position as an assistant coach and recruiter made him a 
public figure which would require him to meet a higher standard of 
proof that he was defamed the newspapers argument said 
but the high court said there was no particular controversy at 
pittsburgh at the time that would have thrust warford into the 
public spotlight 
we agree that the heart of the issue before us is whether 
warfords employment was such that he accepted or assumed the 
risk of public scrutiny we conclude that he did not lambert

michigan court of appeals ruled in a decision released april 19 
the appellate court upheld a ruling by judge william brown that 
blocked the traverse city recordeagle from obtaining details of a 
traverse city teachers contract prior to its ratification 
premature disclosure of the tentative agreement would have a 
negative impact on the negotiation process the appeals court 
wrote 
confidentiality is necessary to maintain frank communication 
between the union and the school board frank communication in 
turn leads to effective negotiation which the circuit court 
concluded outweighed the publics right to disclosure 
the newspaper sued the traverse city area public schools in 
january 1988 thensuperintendent vernon oxender cited an unusual 
circumstance clause in the freedom of information act in refusing 
to release details of the contract until it was ratified

disclose tentative contracts

the minnesota house voted unanimously 
april 23 for a bill that places further limits on the ability of 
governmental bodies to hold closed meetings 
the legislation was drafted in response to a state supreme court 
ruling last year that said meetings must be closed when information 
classified as private under the states data practices act is 
discussed 
the ruling required local governmental bodies to close the 
meeting and kick out the public and kick out the media when they 
wanted to discuss private data said rep phil carruthers who 
helped draft the new law 
that meant that a lot of meetings were being closed that 
really didnt need to be and it seemed inappropriate inconsistent 
with the idea of the open meeting law he said 
the new legislation prohibits local governmental units from 
closing meetings to discuss private data with some exceptions 
such as when it would identify alleged victims of criminal sexual 
conduct 
the bill also says that during an open meeting a public body 
shall make reasonable efforts to protect private data from public 
disclosure for instance it suggests that local officials protect 
the identity of some people by using a number or letter of the 
alphabet when referring to them 
it lays out the specifics of which prevails openness or 
privacy in which types of circumstances so i think it will be a 
lot easier for local governments to deal with and a lot easier for 
the public and for the media carruthers said 
the minnesota newspaper association was a key backer of the new 
bill which passed the house 1280 and the senate 460

the milwaukee journal on april 24 pulled 
advertisements featuring polish leader lech walesa speaking in 
broken english after complaints that the ad amounted to an ethnic 
slur 
the journal used newspaper television and radio advertisements 
featuring walesa and british prime minister margaret thatcher to 
promote its new page designs unveiled in april 
the walesa newspaper advertisement showed a photo of the nobel 
prizewinning founder of polands solidarity movement with the 
words very long i have hoped for changes so significant as those 
in new milwaukee journal 
the thatcher ad pictures the prime minister with the words why 
yes the american colonies have progressed consider the recent 
changes in your milwaukee journal 
both ads involved contrived quotes 
robert dye spokesman for the journal said the ads were 
intended to be lighthearted spoofs and that both were pulled 
i guess it just didnt click dye said it didnt have the 
impact we intended the original intent was that it be fun as soon 
as we realized it wasnt working we pulled the ads 
the quarterpage walesa ad ran in the april 23 journal it drew 
an immediate letter from mayor john o norquist who complained the 
use of the broken english shows an obvious lack of respect for 
walesa and for polish culture 
im sure that since english is not his native language he 
probably does not speak it as well as you do norquist wrote to 
journal editor sig gissler at the same time i wonder how well 
you speak polish 
the head of the citys annual polish ethnic festival charged the 
television advertisement featuring walesa was even more offensive 
to poles 
i thought it rather demeaning to the polish ethnic groups 
said richard gralinski executive director of polish fest i 
certainly thought it was an ethnic slur 
milwaukee a city of about 600000 people has more than 180000 
residents of polish ancestry gralinski said

sandinista loyalists following the election of a new government 
this year opponents of the policy said 
the loyalists have also been given licenses for the first 
private television since the 1979 revolution that brought the 
sandinistas to power 
members of the united national opposition uno transition team 
and the prerevolutionary owners of the radio stations are 
indignant as is la prensa the main opposition newspaper when the 
sandinistas were in power 
sandinista dominance of the media appeared to begin easing a bit 
last year when prior censorship ended the sandinistas also gave 
the opposition a bit of television time during the campaign 
after they lost the feb 25 election the sandinistas lifted the 
ban on private television and began moving to ensure for themselves 
a firm grip on the public eye and ear 
they are trying to dominate the dial said frank arana a 
member of the uno transition team for media matters 
one of the new tv licenses went to the vehemently prosandinista 
publishers of the newspaper el nuevo diario another channel 4 
will be run by a top sandinista official tourism minister herty 
lewites 
meanwhile a new transmission tower has sprouted at what used to 
be the sandinista campaign headquarters the home of a new 
sandinista radio station radio ya radio now 
the uno transition team only learned last week that the 
staterun radio network had been dismantled arana said 
we were morally deceived he said but not surprised 
barricada the sandinista partys official newspaper said the 
idea was to put the radio stations in the hands of people 
concerned with promoting culture and ethical values and morals 
that benefit the great majority and to ensure the continuation 
of participative radio and guarantee communication for ordinary

when the russians downed a us spy plane in the 
famous u2 incident 30 years ago they also accidentally blew one 
of their own aircraft out of the sky killing the pilot the soviet 
army newspaper has disclosed 
the u2 plane piloted by francis gary powers was shot down on 
may 1 1960 disrupting a summit meeting 19 days later in paris 
between president eisenhower and soviet leader nikita s khrushchev 
and forcing the cancellation of another summit planned for later 
that year 
the newspaper red star said in the article sunday that the 
soviets mistakenly shot down a mig19 and its pilot in the 
operation 
the paper also disclosed that the soviets sent up a new fighter 
plane and ordered its pilot to ram the u2 in a suicide mission 
the new fighter reached the u2s altitude but failed to ram it

the lord to open her expensive lakefront house to the homeless 
but neighbors say even gods servants must obey mans laws 
town zoning officials acting on a complaint from a neighbor 
have ordered russell to stop taking in young homeless mothers and 
have threatened her with arrest 
the zoning law in this southern connecticut community of 33000 
requires that threequarters of the people living in a 
singlefamily dwelling be related by blood marriage or adoption 
even the towns zoning officer calls the restrictions outdated but 
that hasnt quieted russells neighbors

first they liked ike then they didnt like 
ike then they liked ike again thats the pattern of historians 
appraisal of dwight d eisenhower whose place in history is still 
to be fixed 
writing in the centennial year of eisenhowers birth historian 
alan brinkley says theres something to be learned about america 
and the american people from eisenhowers seesaw reputation 
brinkleys view is pertinent since george bushs presidency is 
sometimes compared to eisenhowers 
bush like ike is prudent uneager to expand governments role 
like ike bush is accused of lacking vision like ike bush 
presides at a time of peace and prosperity and is accused of doing 
nothing about problems looming just below the surface 
bush like ike is enormously popular in the polls at this 
stage he seems as unbeatable as ike was when he ran for 
reelection in 1956 
when people are suspicious of government have been disappointed 
by it and expect little from it says brinkley their appreciation 
rises for eisenhower and his safe but inactive tenure 
when people look to government for bold leadership and vision 
he says donothing ike falls in repute 
brinkley a 1971 graduate of princeton who was a snip of a lad 
when eisenhower was president is professor of history at the 
graduate school of the city university of new york he reviews the 
record in the wilson quarterly a magazine published by the woodrow 
wilson international center for scholars 
jimmy carter is undergoing the same sort of reappraisal thats 
been eisenhowers fate 
carters stance as an outsider and his illneverlietoyou 
campaign seemed just the antidote to the disillusionments of 
vietnam and watergate but plagued by events beyond his control 
the iran hostage crisis and the oil embargo he left office 
condemned as ineffective 
lately building on his peacemakers reputation forged in the 
camp david accord carter has been winning fresh respect for his 
selfless pursuit of a better world 
in eisenhowers case he was much loved by a people he did not 
much lead 
his presidency says brinkley mirrored the success and 
complacency that characterized much of american life during the 
1950s the i love lucy era 
genial ike war hero played golf and bridge and palled around 
with rich businessmen despite his popularity historians started 
finding fault with his record even before he left office 
throughout the 1960s and much of the 1970s scholars dismissed 
eisenhower as a bland mediocrity a model of what a 20thcentury 
president should not be brinkley says 
a 1962 poll of historians ranked eisenhower 22nd out of 33 
presidents just above chester a arthur the charge was that he 
failed to govern or inspire historians saw him as passive 
ineffective even vaguely stupid brinkley recalls 
by the end of the 1970s however a new verdict was taking hold 
partially because the eisenhower papers had become available to 
scholarship 
no longer seen as the stumblebum ike now was regarded as 
decisive and skillful articulate informed and commanding 
in a new poll in 1982 historians ranked him ninth above john 
f kennedy 
this was postvietnam and postwatergate ike was seen as having 
shrewdly known the limits of american power 
the evaluation arose from the profound disillusionment with 
social activism that began during the late 1960s the association 
of liberalism with vietnam with economic instability with racial 
conflict and with the disappointing results of socialpolicy 
initiatives brinkley says 
what doomed ike to condescension was his refusal to accept the 
idea that government had a great and compelling mission says 
brinkley 
what raised him in estimation were those same qualities he 
says at a time when many americans came to question the 
desirability of a powerful president and the feasibility of a large 
and active government 
nothing in dwight d eisenhowers uneventful presidency 
ensures him an important place in political history he was not a 
lincoln or wilson or roosevelt who led the nation through great 
crises says brinkley he was not a kennedy or johnson or 
nixon who for better or worse charted new paths and left the 
nations public life forever altered 
brinkleys verdict ikes reputation will remain a hostage to 
americans fluctuating expectations of their leaders and their 
state

it seemed for a while that the economy was 
coming in for a soft safe landing with the federal reserve deftly 
working the instrument panel but now the red lights are flashing 
already pinched consumers find themselves paying higher prices 
for basics such as vegetables and fruits meats beverages 
gasoline mortgage rates are rising and rental rates are rising 
even faster 
with many states falling far behind their anticipated revenues 
taxes seem to have only one direction to go little hints are 
dropped here and there that the fed might be ready to raise 
interest rates again 
corporate profits are down theyve been falling for more than a 
year but in that time corporate dividends were raised now unless 
an unexpected profits surge ensues it is likely that dividend cuts 
will become more common 
even without that prospect the stock market has little push 
and the bond market even less the latter is a distinct surprise to 
a great many investors who felt confident that prices would rise 
and rates fall 
the savings and loan debacle seems to expand a few billion 
dollars every time one looks and as it does the confidence of 
americans suffers the more werent these lenders supposed to know 
what they were doing 
now that the damage has been done these same lenders and others 
affected by them are clamping down hard good small companies are 
being denied credit not because they dont deserve it but because 
the lenders are frightened 
the socalled peace dividend has become a peace layoff general 
electric has just announced it will eliminate 4200 aerospace jobs 
lockheed said it would lay off 2750 workers in its aeronautical 
systems component 
meanwhile downward movement in the federal budget deficit seems 
to become more difficult every day improvement in the trade 
deficit could be difficult as well if inflation and higher rates 
raise us production costs 
in an economic sense its not much of a spring you might say 
the clouds hang low and the sun is in hiding just when people were 
looking forward to buying houses and vacationing and getting on 
with postponed projects 
such matters add up in an economic sense to a case of spring 
fever a sense of dolefulness that sometimes snares people just as 
they thought theyd be feeling better 
sulphur and molasses is an ageold recipe for spring fever and 
heres its economic equivalent something to lift your spirits and 
help develop the brighter side of things 
economic swings of mood are common if you analyzed the media 
over the past year you would find alternating periods of hope and 
pessimism not always based on changes in the economic fundamentals 
sometimes the statistical data is skewed in the first quarter 
of the year when inflation seemed to be gaining a strong foothold 
high prices of several items might have been temporary or 
distorted by methodology 
oil prices already have fallen sharply the 21 percent 
firstquarter rise of apparel prices might have been misstated 
because of the lateness of easter after which clothing prices 
often are marked down 
says prudential bache economist edward yardeni the cpi 
inflation rate during the second quarter could be as low as 1 
percent because the firstquarter number was boosted by a number of 
onetime aberrations mostly weather related 
freemarket industrial economies all of them everywhere 
are cyclical they are forever in motion either up or down when 
they are down they are regrouping to move up when they are up 
they are forever in danger of falling 
higher interest rates if they come will eventually help to 
squelch inflation the two might exist side by side for a while 
but it is unlikely they can coexist as they did in the 1970s for 
several years 
there are advantages to a weak economy interest rates 
eventually fall housing becomes more affordable if only 
temporarily consumers and businesses retrench cut waste and do 
without getting better value for the dollar 
muddling through is as old as tradition it has worked before

the mississippi delta is a rich land yet its 
people are perhaps the poorest in the nation the region has 
staggering rates of poverty illiteracy teenage pregnancy and 
infant mortality illustrating how hard times can weigh heaviest on

extra series children of the delta examines what decades of 
neglect have done to the regions children and whats being done

willie mae watson lives with her 
six children and 11 grandchildren in a fourroom shanty without 
plumbing or even an outhouse 18 people sheltered by little more 
than plywood walls and a torn tin roof 
not far away 22yearold flora knight barely an adult herself 
struggles to earn a high school diploma while raising her six 
children ages 7 6 5 3 2 and 4 months 
they dont have too good a chance she said i dont think 
theyll have a job waiting here for them even if they go to school 
and finish 
the mighty river and loamy soil of the mississippi delta from 
downstate illinois to louisianas gulf coast form one of the most 
abundant basins on earth yielding agricultural treasures for the 
rest of the world 
why then does this land that mark twain called the body of 
the nation not support its own children 
why do a higher percentage of people here live in extreme 
poverty than do in appalachia why do the rich cargoes of the 
rivers barges and tankers just pass these children by 
the delta ranks higher than some third world countries in infant 
mortality unemployment runs 60 percent above the national average 
and per capita income only 10192 averages 25 percent less 
yet the region is almost invisible to most americans 
why 
the answer seems to center on ageold bias and modern neglect 
the delta which gave birth to the blues is a victim of decades of 
racism economic failure and indifference according to a federal 
commission that has studied the sevenstate region of 8 million 
people for 1 years 
next week members of the lower mississippi delta development 
commission will report to congress on how to stimulate growth in 
the area which covers parts of illinois missouri kentucky 
tennessee arkansas mississippi and louisiana 
but forging a better future for the 3 million children of the 
delta will take more than suggestions in a report 
this aint no good place to grow up but we try our best 
said mavis watson one of the 18 people living in the shack on the 
panther burn plantation here 
despite a concerted effort among states to improve their 
schools a pattern of poor education scares off employers and their 
potential jobs too many people fail to take advantage of the 
meager medical care available and environmental troubles compound 
health problems 
agriculture remains the dominant industry but jobs have been 
lost to mechanization many of the poor here most of them black 
find only minimumwage seasonal labor at harvest time most find 
work so rarely that they dont even qualify for unemployment 
benefits 
i hear people say nothing good ever going to happen here 
said bubba sullivan who runs an eclectic blues record store in 
helena ark if you dont have industry you dont have a middle 
class you cant blame kids on welfare 
unskilled uneducated and without savings they cant find a way 
to a better life too often their children are chained to a future 
as bleak as the past 
rates of teenage pregnancy dropouts and youth unemployment are 
among the nations worst in some counties a higher percentage of 
babies die than in french guiana or malaysia one county 
mississippis tunica has been called americas ethiopia 
people matteroffactly relate horror stories from a 
10yearold boy lighting scraps of paper in his house for warmth to 
a child saved by 100000 worth of medical treatment at a 
university hospital only to return home to a shack and die from rat 
bites 
the 1980 census found more than onethird of all housing lacked 
either complete plumbing or central heating despite federal 
programs that replaced some dilapidated shacks crumbling houses 
are common 
role models the people with grit and drive mostly move away 
those who earn degrees or learn skills cant find jobs that pay 
well so they head elsewhere 
louisiana for example once kept 70 percent of the doctors it 
educated and trained now only 30 percent stay according to greg 
bowser of the louisiana health care authority 
our biggest export people said stan hyland a memphis 
state university anthropologist working with the commission 
welfare payments through aid to families with dependent children 
amounted to almost 340 million in 1986 in the 214 counties of the 
delta region and that was only a fraction of government transfer 
payments to the deltas poor almost 2 billion excluding medicare 
and medicaid 
even with such spending the most basic want can be found in the 
countless tiny towns and clusters of farmworkers houses edging the 
flat croplands 
when youre getting children ready to go to school and they 
dont have the proper clothes to put on and theyre old enough to 
know that this is not the way theyre supposed to go to school 
weve found that that is causing a lot of our dropouts said the 
rev bertha thurman of belzoni miss theyre ashamed 
ms thurman is raising a 16yearold foster daughter and the 
daughters 2yearold son on food stamps and her income from 
cleaning houses 
youve just got to have a heart full of love and you cant 
buy groceries with it either she said make you pray a whole 
lot

theres nothing as an alternative to drinking and drugs and 
standing around on street corners and sitting on hoods of cars we 
do not have a movie theater theres no teen center said ms 
bishoff who is pushing to get a center built 
theres no enrichment for these children nothing to show them 
the world beyond 
for many children in the delta said rims barber who has worked 
with the poor in mississippi since 1964 life is only something 
that happens to them theyre only passive players ask me what 
i might do tonight i can handle that ask me what i might do when 
i grow up i cant handle that 
annie brown is working to change things but shes found people 
arent always eager for change 
mrs brown daughter of a sharecropper runs a literacy program 
in rolling fork miss that she started in 1985 with classes 
around a card table in her funeral home twentyseven adults have 
since earned high school diplomas 
illiteracy is a poisonous disease to our children said mrs 
brown who thunders with the fiery passion of a preacher when 
describing how white residents fought her efforts for fear of 
losing cooks maids and farmhands 
here you have to push you have to demand you have to say 
this is what we are going to do she said i get knocked down 
sometimes but i bounce back like a rubber ball 
blacks and whites in the delta agree leaders in the past were 
reluctant to move away from the agricultural economy that so 
enriched the landowners 
development lagged river ports lost business and the nations 
motherland was left to fall further and further behind 
if progress is to be made attitudes must change including a 
plantation orientation lingering from the days of slave and 
master said emma cooperharris who runs a community development 
organization in rolling fork 
this goes way back beyond what the eye can see she said 
my daddy is illiterate but he had visions for his children 
hed often tell us and give us a paddling if he thought that we 
werent doing what we were supposed to have done in school 
because i want you to grow up and be somebody i dont want you to 
have to work on this farm like i have ever since i was 8 years 
old he had visions for us 
youve got teen parents in the 10th grade and their children 
are in kindergarten we have sixth and seventhgraders that have 
had abortions im empty when i talk about it 
martha ann michael a mother prodding her three children to 
study in their 15by30foot shack outside cary miss tries her 
best to preach the value of education to her children 
my baby she said of her 6yearold daughter shes an 
honor roll student 
the family survives on food stamps and 144amonth welfare and 
hopes simply to reach the top of a long waiting list for 
comparatively spacious public housing 
when theres work at a local cotton gin she pays off backlogged 
bills and tries to set aside something for small christmas or 
birthday presents 
if she could change things my children would have everything 
they wanted she said

a federal commission studying the 
mississippi delta region for 18 months will offer a roadmap for 
slow gradual economic improvement when it issues its final report 
to congress next week 
the lower mississippi delta development commission will call for 
greater regional cooperation such as environmental compacts and 
university research consortiums extra help in steering kids to 
college leadership training to change entrenched attitudes 
that have held the delta back and some government aid 
despite stressing the need for more help from the federal 
government govs bill clinton of arkansas buddy roemer of 
louisiana and ray mabus of mississippi all of whom serve on the 
ninemember commission say they wont be asking for a quickfix or 
a vast new dealtype program 
if there is a peace dividend you want to invest in 
america why not start here roemer said 
the work of this commission is not about handouts though 
its about giving choices and some options to people who too often 
feel they have none he said 
added wilbur hawkins the federal commissions executive 
director we bail out the savings and loans we send millions to 
poland and to panama i just dont want this nation for the first 
time in its history to say we cant help the unfortunate 
the memphisbased commission has not been without controversy 
black leaders reacted angrily when all nine panelists appointed 
were white men even though onethird of the deltas population is 
black hawkins hired after the uproar is black 
the commission which has spent 3 million on its study was 
modeled after past federal bodies appointed to deal with regional 
problems such as the tennessee valley authority and the 
appalachian regional commission 
but clinton the commission chairman said he believes the 
document released may 14 will be unique in government 
it will literally be a handbook for a decade of action he 
said we want a report that says what the national government is 
supposed to do what the state governments are supposed to do the 
local governments and the private sector 
tourism will be one area the commission hopes to help develop 
officials said marketing will be another some on the commission 
hope for a common markettype cooperation among the states and 
perhaps even a mississippi delta logo and promotional campaign for 
local products 
people on wall street see more attractive investments in 
venezuela than in the mississippi delta and thats a marketing 
problem said stan hyland a memphis state university 
anthropologist working on the commission staff 
weve got to put in place incentives to bring our youth back 
home and our capital back home hawkins said 
we cant just afford to take a bandaid approach

counties included in the mississippi delta 
region have long held the dubious distinction of having some of 
americas poorest and most troubled schools illiteracy and dropout 
rates are high money is scarce and the legacy of a troubled racial 
past compounds the problems but in recent years several states 
have made education reform a priority this second report in a

when warner dickerson strides the 
school halls in this poor patch of tennessee he confronts the 
traditions that rend young lives 
he sees girls whove become mothers too soon and boys wholl 
give up on school too early the children of men and women who 
mostly grew up the same way 
a new generation an old predicament a common denominator 
if you had to sum it up with a word or expression its 
poverty said dickerson superintendent of the fayette county 
schools your morality is different your longrange planning is 
different you just live from day to day you dont plan ahead 
babies having babies illiteracy among parents not having 
jobs its all here 
such problems have paralyzed the mississippi delta region which 
includes parts of arkansas illinois kentucky louisiana 
mississippi missouri and tennessee many of them home to some of 
americas poorest and most troubled schools 
mississippi has consistently ranked lowest in the nation on 
standardized test scores kentucky ranks at the bottom in 
percentage of high school graduates 
dickerson the first black to run this 5000student rural 
school district in southwestern tenneessee faces similar daunting 
challenges 
the dropout rate is 33 percent more than one in four adults 
cant read or write poverty is so pervasive that 86 percent of the 
students qualify for free lunches 
you have parents of these children who do not value education 
very highly the superintendent said when their kids get 
grown they wont value education for their kids 
but for every problem dickerson has a program 
for teen mothers its a daycare center and parenting class at 
the high school for adults literacy and high school equivalency 
diploma classes for working parents a plan to keep buildings open 
12 hours a day and for welfare mothers not in school job training 
and placement 
since taking over four years ago dickerson whose district is 
70 percent black has added academic programs seen some test 
scores improve opened a new school and closed three others that 
you would wonder if they were fit for hogs to live in 
still three of eight schools have no gyms classes have 
staggered starting times because there arent enough buses teacher 
salaries are low turnover is high there arent enough computers 
or modern shop equipment 
money would be one solution but dickerson says his district 
receives only twothirds the dollars it needs annual per pupil 
expenditures in 198889 were 2729 the national average is 
4770 his district and scores of others have sued the state of 
tennessee contending its method of funding is inequitable and 
unconstitutional 
across the delta history and racism have also contributed to 
the misery 
emphasis was placed on getting the most out of the land and 
schooling interfered 
historically there was a prohibition against education in the 
south particularly of the africanamerican population said 
wilbur hawkins executive director of the lower mississippi delta 
development commission 
what were finding is the end result of many years of 
neglect he said 
last year 17 mississippi school districts were placed on 
probation because of low test scores the penalties were part of a 
reform package typical of the states in the region since the early 
1980s 
kentucky recently overhauled its entire school system after the 
state supreme court ruled it unconstitutional because of variances 
in districttodistrict spending louisiana arkansas mississippi 
and tennessee have passed reforms to address entrenched delta 
realities 
according to the last census for example dropout rates in the 
region averaged 25 percent compared with 20 percent nationally 
and ran more than 40 percent in seven delta counties 
the census also found that 45 percent of delta residents older 
than 25 and six of 10 blacks in that group never finished high 
school 
some blame high dropout rates on the lack of jobs in the area 
theres little incentive to get a diploma because it wont mean 
anything others point to poverty 
its easier to drop out if you dont have a good pair of shoes 
to go to school with said huel perkins a member of louisianas 
board of elementary and secondary education its easier to drop 
out if you dont see light at the end of the tunnel 
what you live in can be a deterrent to staying in school he 
said you get up in squalor one day you say what the heck im 
not going anymore 
although many private and public projects teach reading 
illiteracy runs high in many areas a third of mississippis 
adults for instance 
this lack of basic skills compounding a national perception 
of the delta as a social and political backwater in the words of 
the delta commission only makes it more difficult to attract 
industry 
still some signs are encouraging 
while school desegregation in the mid1960s led to white flight

signs with skulls and crossbones are 
posted now in devils swamp but nothing warned barbara dixons 
husband of the dangers when he hunted and fished there in 1986 
bringing home the bounty of this sportsmans paradise 
mrs dixon loved the crawfish the catfish and the rabbits and 
ate them all while pregnant 
at age 3 weeks her daughter began having seizures before her 
first birthday tiny emily was diagnosed with neuroblastoma a rare 
cancer on her spinal cord before her fourth birthday she had 
endured chemotherapy and three operations 
but emily dixon is one of the luckier victims in what locals 
call the cancer corridor for its concentration of chemical 
companies she survived and is considered 90 percent cured 
theres no doubt in her mothers mind the chemical companies are 
to blame 
its easy to say they are ruining our water and doing this and 
that and its no big deal but when youre ruining our children 
thats something else mrs dixon said 
across the mississippi delta region which includes parts of 
arkansas illinois kentucky louisiana mississippi missouri and 
tennessee health and environmental problems are intertwined and 
troubles abound 
they hit hardest it seems at those most vulnerable the 3 
million children of the delta 
robert lingafelter runs a mississippi program called partners 
for improved nutrition and health which uses techniques developed 
in the third world to fight the deltas sometimes third world 
conditions 
he sees progress since the days only 25 years ago of 
biafrastyle malnutrition and yet in the face of what has 
not yet been done he said the deltas a national tragedy 
death rates in many counties by the river are higher than the 
national average along louisianas chemicalproducing region 
cancer rates are higher than would normally be expected though 
scientists have yet to establish a direct cause 
poverty teenage motherhood and poor nutrition along with 
doctor and nursing shortages exact a toll on health exacerbated 
by lax environmental laws and the heavy use of agricultural 
pesticides and other chemicals 
a january survey by the washingtonbased center for the study of 
social policy ranked mississippi and louisiana 50th and 51st 
respectively on childrens health 
the united states has a national infant mortality rate of 107 
per 1000 live births in the delta the rate is 125 
for years humphreys county miss has had one of the highest 
infant mortality rates in the world higher than malaysia french 
guiana and other lessdeveloped nations eight infants died in 
1988 giving the county a rate of 332 
we dont really know why said lou anne mclendon the 
countys public health nurse who runs a clinic offering prenatal 
care and nutrition but most of the mothers whose infants died did 
not take advantage of the prenatal care offered she said 
onethird of the babies delivered last year were born to 
teenagers including 59 to mothers 13 and 14 years old according 
to dr alfio rausa a greenwood miss physician who oversees the 
delta district for the state health department 
part of it is lack of education no hope no recreation 
rausa said the family structure has broken down 
lake county tenn population about 7500 has only one doctor 
who runs a clinic and serves as director of the health department 
assistant director of the nursing home and county medical examiner 
should an emergency such as cardiac arrest or multiple 
trauma occur the chances of survival in lake county are 
approximately zero dr renee lamb said at a public hearing 
before the lower mississippi delta development commission 
in many parts of the delta residents believe the polluted 
environment is as much a culprit for their ills as inadequate care 
they point to the dozens of sprawling shiny plants tucked in 
the swampy delta amid mosscovered trees plants that spew 
chemicals including known carcinogens into the air and water 
louisiana ranked 48th in an environmental health survey released 
in april by the durham ncbased institute for southern studies 
it was no surprise to those who live here 
for decades the south louisiana has taken its environment 
for granted louisiana gov buddy roemer said we had to hustle 
so hard for jobs people just gave up their environmental 
considerations 
the mississippi river not only provides drainage for twothirds 
of the nation but also is a disposal route for tons of chemicals 
and pollutants 
the river carries 213 million pounds of toxic chemicals through 
new orleans each year according to a twoyear study by the 
environmental group greenpeace 
teresa robert who lives near the river in the middle of the 
socalled cancer corridor remembers swimming in the river as a 
child almost 30 years ago 
now i would not think of sticking my foot in it said mrs 
robert who formed an environmental group that blocked a planned 
waste dump in ascension parish the parish already is home to three 
of louisianas 11 superfund sites targeted by the environmental 
protection agency for cleanup 
pharmacist kay gaudet in nearby st gabriel can chart her towns 
health through the drugs she dispenses in a ninemonth period in 
1986 mrs gaudet discovered that the second most commonly 
prescribed drug was for breast cancer only this year has that drug 
made it into the top 200 drugs used nationwide 
theres no question in my mind what causes it but if you try 
to find a smoking gun its going to be impossible she said 
the louisiana chemical association the trade group for the 
states largest industry insists its products are not responsible 
for the high cancer rates residents penchant for spicy food rich 
living smoking and other factors all play a part the group says 
spokesman richard kleiner added however that the chemical 
companies know they have a lot of problems of the past to 
correct 
st judes hospital an international center specializing in 
childrens cancer ended up in memphis tenn in part because of 
the health problems of the children of the region 
louisiana parents gather in support groups there and shake their 
heads in disbelief at their numbers in the waiting rooms 
but dr elizabeth thompson st judes physicianinchief said 
researchers there like others have been unable to find a link 
between the chemical discharges and the high incidence of cancer 
barbara dixon says she doesnt need proof she brings emily to 
testify in support of environmental bills hoping lawmakers will 
reverse concessions to the chemical industry and tighten pollution 
controls 
she says she doesnt want the plants to close because too many 
people depend on the jobs 
i want them to be responsible mrs dixon said i want 
them to stop saying the cost is too much to control our air quality 
or our water quality 
what is the cost of my childs life

the day cleo dunnings said goodbye to her 
daughter they both realized a bitter fact of life the road to 
success often leads one way straight out of this delta town 
with no job and no strong prospects donna dunnings sidney moved 
north following a route many of her peers have taken packing 
their skills their dreams and part of this towns future 
its frustrating that a community i grew up in that i lived 
in that was a part of me and my family could not open doors to 
me said mrs sidney 25 an accounting graduate who left helena 
in 1987 for chicago where she works for the cook county assessor 
i felt if i could have stayed i could have made things a 
little better and right some wrongs 
its very sad said her mother a city council member 
well continue to lose them until we get something for them to 
do 
this mississippi river town typifies many communities in the 
delta region which includes parts of arkansas illinois kentucky 
louisiana mississippi missouri and tennessee 
it hungers for jobs to hold on to young folks yearns for the 
golden era when stores were open and streets were crowded and 
dreams of the day when prosperity will come back to stay 
helena pretty much reflects everything the delta has been and 
is both in promise and problems said ken hubbell director of 
the delta cultural center 
it has the river but poverty a legacy of strained race 
relations but new efforts by blacks and whites to work together 
the biggest prospect for the future is a 35 million slackwater 
harbor and industrial park partly financed by county residents who 
recently approved a temporary 1cent sales tax increase 
its a hope said rod frazier vice president of quincy 
soybean co we dont really have much else to stake our hopes on 
in this area 
the 29milelong harbor holds enormous potential one study 
estimates it could create 30000 jobs within 15 years of completion 
in 1993 
and helena has other big plans the 85 million cultural 
center which will include a museum performance stage and 
archives is being built in this land of cotton and home of the 
blues 
theres already a tourism draw the king biscuit blues festival 
which attracted 40000 visitors last year from as far as sweden 
and new zealand 
but while bringing in outsiders is important so is keeping 
insiders the next generation 
you raise a family up and what can you offer to your kids 
asked jessie blakely a liquor store owner surveying weedfilled 
lots from his window 
two major forces contributed to helenas troubles the 
postworld war ii agricultural revolution when machines replaced 
man and the loss of three industries in the mid70s and early 
80s that employed more than 1200 people 
the result is a giant gap between haves and havenots 
the lack of a viable middle class is one of the problems of 
this area said lt simes ii an attorney and radio station 
owner who lives in adjacent west helena we have a lot of poor 
people and a lot of rich people 
while there are stately victorian mansions in this town of 
9500 around the downtown area about one of three stores is 
closed windows are caked in dust buildings are boarded up and 
the paint on a movie house that played its last picture show long 
ago is chipped and peeling 
of about 34700 phillips county residents a 21 percent 
population drop since 1960 more than 30 percent were on food 
stamps in february 
as in many delta counties theres great disparity between 
whites and blacks who make up 55 percent of the population in the 
last census for example the white poverty rate was 146 percent 
for blacks it was 618 percent 
a gap also exists in education some 25 percent to 30 percent of 
county residents cant read or write and though unemployment rates 
have dropped 1989s 132 percent county average was 2 times the 
national level blacks fared far worse than whites 
for many the advent of combines tractors the cotton 
harvesting machine and pesticides was the beginning of the end 
eliminating by the estimate of one us agriculture department 
demographer the jobs of threequarters of sharecropping families 
according to a 1985 report 75 percent of blacks working in the 
delta were directly involved in agriculture in 1950 in 1980 it 
was 14 percent 
agriculture remains the dominant industry here and in other 
delta counties but it takes fewer people and more sophistication 
a combines more than 120000 it doesnt make sense to 
put an illiterate person on that piece of machinery said bart 
lindsey executive vice president of the first national bank of 
phillips county its too big of an investment 
other jobs have emerged in the delta cutandsew operations in 
the missouri bootheel vegetable production in arkansas and 
tennessee catfish farms and processing plants in mississippi 
its been said in a number of circles nothing has changed from 
the plantation era but the crop instead of cotton its the 
catfish industry said wilbur hawkins executive director of the 
lower mississippi delta development commission 
we have replaced one lowpaying job with another said larry 
farmer president of mississippi action for community education 
most of the persons who work in these catfish plants are 
lowskilled its a deadend kind of job 
in helena some feel the priorities are confused education 
should be improved first so businesses will want to come here 
if not i dont care if you put 10 harbors or 10 anything here 
i have no hope at all said dr robert miller who grew up in 
the area 
but blakely the liquor store owner thinks helenas day is 
coming 
anything worthwhile is worth waiting for he said theres 
going to be a future i think our town will come back

editors note no one knows how many americans are going 
hungry some estimate as many as 20 million volunteers who helped 
feed the poor in the emergency of the last recession are still at 
work in a network of charitable soup kitchens and food banks 
trying to fill a void left by a cutback in governmental largess 
this is the first of two articles

hunger is something americas come to live with 
in the same way that we have a football season we now have a 
hunger season says nancy amidei a washington dc activist 
it begins with world hunger day in october and runs on through 
thanksgiving with a big orgy of stories about feeding people huge 
meals at christmas time 
the season ends but hunger continues and after eight years of 
economic improvement americans who pitched in to help their 
neighbors through an emergency now find themselves in a curious 
position 
in a nation of supermarkets and surpluses they are forging 
careers in food banks and soup kitchens 
we used to show up for work in birkenstocks and blue jeans 
now were talking pension plans and retirement and transferring 
from one part of the country to another as food bankers says 
catherine damato director of the western massachusetts food bank 
no one knows how many americans face chronic hunger the 
harvardbased physician task force on hunger in america estimated 
in 1985 that 20 million people were going hungry at least some days 
of every month a louis harris poll at about the same time 
concluded that a minimum of 21 million people were going hungry 
the federal government disputed both findings but has released 
no numbers of its own the food resource and action center frac 
the nations leading hunger research and advocacy group is 
conducting a nationwide study of childhood hunger based on its 
findings to date frac believes that 8 million to 9 million 
children are either hungry or at risk of going hungry 
even though america has a welldeveloped system for carrying 
food from farms to markets the 1980s saw a grassroots antihunger 
effort develop into a second distribution network by conservative 
estimates more than 20000 food banks soup kitchens food 
pantries church groups community action programs and civic 
organizations have helped deliver food since 1982 
in an era of lower wages higher housing costs and shrinking 
public programs theres no doubt that private nonprofit food 
programs have become lifelines for many people 
but for some advocates the crisisdriven effort of the 80s is 
giving way to new doubts in the 90s about whether emergency 
services that now seem all too permanent are really an answer 
to many americans soup kitchens are reassuring evidence of the 
nations humanity proof that the private sector the thousand 
points of light is willing to shoulder its share of the burden 
such programs intercept millions of pounds of food that would 
otherwise be wasted and make it available to people who need it in 
the process they focus attention on hunger and provide people a 
means of addressing it as donors fundraisers or volunteers 
in some cases informal private programs offer more humane 
treatment than bureaucratic public programs for those on societys 
fringes the programs provide social contact along with meals or 
groceries they also bring together people who might otherwise fall 
through gaps in the governments safety net making it possible for 
social scientists to document the extent of the problem federal 
programs are designed to be of great assistance but government 
cannot do it all says rep bill emerson rmo the ranking 
minority member of the house agriculture subcommittee on nutrition 
and a champion of privatesector initiatives 
there are those who argue government ought to do it all i 
think it should do what it needs to do what it can do 
total spending on food assistance makes up about 2 percent of 
the federal budget according to frac 
congress is considering spending an additional 23 billion for 
food programs over the next three years the mickey leland memorial 
domestic hunger relief act named for the texas congressman who 
died while investigating hunger in ethiopia last year is the 
largest antihunger initiative since 1977

the following is a glossary of terms commonly used to refer to 
nonprofit agencies private initiatives and government programs 
related to hunger relief 
food banks are nonprofit community organizations that collect 
surplus commodities from the government and edible but often 
unmarketable foods from private industry for use by nonprofit 
charities institutions and feeding programs at nominal cost 
second harvest is a national food banking network to which the 
majority of food banks belong its 200 member food banks comprise 
the largest charitable feeding program in the nation 
soup kitchens are small feeding operations attached to existing 
organizations such as churches civic groups or nonprofit agencies 
that serve prepared meals that are consumed onsite soup kitchens 
generally do not require clients to prove need or show 
identification 
food pantries usually attached to existing nonprofit agencies 
distribute bags or boxes of groceries to people experiencing food 
emergencies foods distributed by pantries are prepared and 
consumed elsewhere referrals or proof of need are often required 
there are roughly two food pantries to every soup kitchen 
temporary emergency food assistance program tefap is a program 
that transfers surplus government commodities to states and 
localities for distribution by nonprofit agencies to the needy 
food stamps are the governments premier nutrition program 
reaching 19 million americans a month half of them children 
unlike private emergency programs food stamps enable recipients 
to buy food in supermarkets food stamp benefits average 57 cents 
per person per meal with a maximum benefit of about 90 cents food 
stamps are an entitlement program meaning everyone who meets 
eligibility requirements is entitled to participate but recent 
studies indicate only 40 to 60 percent of those who are eligible 
actually participate in the program 
women infants and children wic is a federal program that 
provides nutritious supplements to pregnant and postpartum women 
infants and children up to age 5 studies have shown wic to be an 
effective program in preventing low birthweight and infant 
mortality and in encouraging lowincome women to receive prenatal 
care wic is not an entitlement program only about half of those 
eligible are being served primarily due to inadequate funding

here are some highlights of the mickey leland memorial domestic 
hunger relief act hr 4110 the largest antihunger initiative 
since 1977 as introduced in the house the bill would 
increase benefits for the food stamp program and the temporary 
emergency food assistance program by 600 million in fiscal 1991 
and 23 billion over the next three years 
provide a 2 percent acrosstheboard increase in food stamp 
benefit levels in addition to inflation 
provide higher food stamp benefit levels for families whose 
housing costs exceed 50 percent of their incomes the group at 
highest risk of homelessness 
raise the fair market value of vehicles food stamp recipients 
can own from the current 4500 set in 1977 to 5500 in fiscal 
1991 and adjust for inflation thereafter 
allow relatives who buy and cook food separately to be 
considered separate food stamp households with the exception of 
minor children living with their parents current law requires 
people to apply together with parents siblings and adult children 
thereby discouraging doubling up with relatives 
exclude the first 50 monthly child support payment from 
consideration as income in determining food stamp benefits the 
food stamp program currently counts these payments as income which 
lowers benefits and discourages custodial parents from seeking 
child support

on july 8 1853 americans went calling on the japanese who had 
sealed themselves off from the world for centuries they werent 
glad to see us 
on dec 7 1941 the japanese came calling on americans we 
werent at all glad to see them 
in 1947 six years after the attack on pearl harbor a group of 
american businessmen went to tokyo at the behest of their 
government to see if japans devastated economy could be brought to 
life they found ways 
now in 1990 hat in hand american officials confer anxiously 
with the japanese once again in the hope of persuading them to open 
their gates 
it has been you might say a strange relationship a classic 
study in irony 
it was the united states that opened japan and brought it 
into the global marketplace in 1853 until then for two and a half 
centuries the country was so fiercely private that foreign sailors 
shipwrecked on its shores werent allowed to leave and japanese 
sailors thrown up on foreign shores werent allowed to come home 
today little shy remote reclusive japan is resoundingly no 
longer any of the above japanese investors are as ubiquitous as 
japanese tourists they are into everything from the skating rink 
at rockefeller center in new york to the sistine chapel in the 
vatican 
today 137 years after an american sailor persuaded them to 
trade the japanese sell 49 billion more of their products in the 
united states than the united states sells in japan today japan 
joins the united states in having the two largest economies in the 
world and in sharing onethird of the worlds total output of goods 
and services 
this munificence began in a remarkable comic opera in which the 
fragile delicacy of the east was introduced to the chutzpah of the 
west 
on that day in 1853 commodore matthew calbraith perry sailed up 
tokyo bay in four black warships belching black smoke the japanese 
had never seen steamers before they thought these were floating 
volcanoes 
local officials came aboard to tell the intruders to state their 
business and be gone perry said he would talk to no one of minor 
rank a vice governor came out perry wouldnt see him the 
governor came and perry let it be known through subordinates that 
he would meet with a japanese prince ashore to transmit a letter 
from president millard fillmore to the emperor of japan and unless 
it was delivered the united states of america would be gravely 
insulted 
agreed but not without ceremony the japanese built a pavilion 
festooned with beautiful silks to receive the letter they lined 
the shore with 5000 soldiers and then flanked by two armed 
gigantic blacks perry landed with 100 sailors 100 marines and 
three ships bands playing hail columbia 
with bows all around he delivered the letter which was 
inscribed on vellum bound in blue velvet sealed in a rosewood box 
trimmed in gold and signed by your good friend millard 
fillmore who apparently made friends easily perry said he would 
be back next year for the emperors answer and sailed off 
back he came on feb 11 1854 this time with seven ships and 
gifts of sets of freshly invented telegraph instruments a 
quartersize steam locomotive capable of 20 mph and complete with 
cars and tracks four volumes of audubons birds of america an 
assortment of farm tools and guns a barrel of whiskey and several 
cases of champagne 
thus was the east won the emperor signed a treaty agreeing to 
limited trade the safe return of shipwrecked american sailors and 
the use of two ports as coal stations japan had joined the world 
having fought foreign influences it now embraced them it sent 
students bureaucrats and businessmen abroad to learn from the west 
and imported western teachers at high salaries to teach its young 
it erected factories encouraged foreign trade and built a strong 
army and navy

and soon japan which for centuries wouldnt risk life beyond 
its own islands now decided it couldnt survive on them alone it 
reached out for markets and raw materials the way the west did and 
with two wars only 10 years apart against china and russia it 
carved an empire on the mainland of asia 
with 61 other countries it renounced war as an instrument of 
national policy in 1928 and three years later renounced the 
renouncement it marched again in china and manchuria in the hunt 
for new markets and fodder for its growing war machine 
finally its strategists concluded only one obstacle stood 
between japan and the rubber of indochina the bauxite and tin of 
malaya and burma and the oil of the dutch east indies and so the 
former recluse and pupil charged through the door perry had opened 
and attacked the united states at pearl harbor while its 
negotiators talked peace in washington 
the war it thus started cost japan 1972000 lives military and 
civilian and killed 98211 americans it brought japan the shame 
of its first surrender to a foreign invader douglas macarthur 
riding through tokyo on a road lined with 30000 japanese soldiers 
their backs to the conqueror in a mark of respect usually reserved 
for the emperor 
it was a war that cost japan dearly but also in the perverse 
way of history to come rewarded the loser it brought japan 
democracy in a constitution written by americans in three weeks a 
document that renounced war and included an article guaranteeing 
equal rights to women which americans have yet to see in their own 
constitution 
in the immediate postwar years it was uncle sam who fed japan 
and brought a rebirth of its smoldering industry with dollars and 
direction it was a group of american businessmen headed by joseph 
dodge a banker from detroit yes detroit who told the japanese 
they had to cut inflation build exports limit domestic 
consumption put a lid on wages improve productivity and close 
plants that couldnt compete 
it was the constitution written by americans that denied japan 
an army navy and air force and freed its economy to grow 
unfettered by military costs it was american bombs that flattened 
japanese factories and made totally new ones inevitable which 
brought new technology and new efficiency unmatched by the old 
plants in detroit and gary ind finally it was the war in korea 
that brought japan more billions as a base and supplier 
little or none of this can be credited to uncle sams big heart 
his interest lay with a strong stable japan on his side of the 
cold war 
and there japan remained while its economy grew at twice the 
speed of uncles and produced and sold more automobiles more ships 
and more television sets than any country in the world including 
the homeland of henry ford 
for a country that once wanted to live alone and be left alone 
japan has proven spectacularly gregarious the global reach of its 
investors now promises to replace the british empire in the old 
cliche about where the sun never sets 
sony buys columbia pictures mitsubishi is getting cozy with 
daimlerbenz and bringing together the descendants of the folks who 
used to build japanese fighters and german tanks japanese money is 
showing up in the shadows of 7eleven stores nippon television 
network pays for the restoration of michelangelos sistine chapel 
in exchange for exclusive film and tv rights japanese investors

editors note thousands of haitians toil in the sugar cane 
fields of the dominican republic under conditions compared to 
slavery by some human rights activists even a report commissioned 
by the state sugar council which administers the governmentrun 
plantations described their plight as absolute poverty under one 
of the most oppressive systems one can imagine 
</TEXT>

from dawn to dusk 
under a fierce tropical sun imported haitian workers hack sugar 
cane with machetes and load it into wagons pulled by gaunt oxen 
leaning into wooden yokes 
horsemen with shotguns and pistols patrol the dusty lanes 
soldiers guard bridges and crossroads watching for runaways 
the braceros or laborers and their families live in tiny 
shacks in the bateys the squalid compounds on the 
governmentrun plantations most without running water or 
electricity they have little to eat 
a report by three human rights groups in october compared the 
plight of the haitian braceros to slavery saying they are being 
held on the dominican plantations at gunpoint 
like their ancestors brought from africa they are forced to 
labor against their will cutting sugar cane for armed dominican 
masters said the report commissioned by americas watch 
caribbean rights and the national coalition for haitian refugees 
manuel de jesus vinas caceres director of the state sugar 
council which administers the governmentrun plantations rejects 
comparisons of the cane cutters to slaves he contends they are no 
worse off than farm laborers elsewhere in latin america 
it is a drama of poverty present in all the rural zones of 
latin america he says 
we have to improve things i agree 
an independent study commissioned by the state sugar council 
published in 1986 as a 636page book titled el batey said the 
cane cutters live in absolute poverty under one of the most 
oppressive systems one can imagine many of the workers dont 
even eat once a day 
the state sugar council is an autonomous government bureaucracy 
that administers 279000 acres yielding 60 percent of the countrys 
sugar 
onequarter of dominican workers are unemployed but they shun 
the backbreaking labor of cutting cane which pays only an average 
of 235 a day for harvesting 15 tons 
so sugar plantations recruit about 40000 workers each year from 
haiti which shares the island of hispaniola with the dominican 
republic and is the poorest nation in the western hemisphere 
many of the workers are brought across the border by recruiters 
who are paid 250 a head since many of the haitians are in the 
country illegally they have few rights 
recruits known as congos live in tiny huts or in rooms 12 
feet square in long concrete barracks resembling stables with no 
kitchens stoves bathrooms or running water as many as 10 to 14 
men sleep in each room 
veteran haitian workers called viejos are crammed with 
their families into oneroom shacks or huts 
haitian workers may leave the plantations at the end of the 
harvest season which runs from november to may 
conditions are better at central romana a private usowned 
operation of 140845 acres that is the worlds largest sugar 
plantation 
housing is about the same but central romana provides its 
workers with schools medical care running water and subsidized 
beef chicken and vegetables 
for decades the dominican republic contracted for 15000 
workers a year by paying 2 million to the haitian government the 
arrangement began in 1952 and ended with the fall of the duvalier 
dictatorship in haiti in 1986 
if you are going to blame anyone you have to blame both sides 
for the quasislave trade says anglican bishop telesforo a 
isaac who grew up on a sugar plantation he said payments are made 
on both sides of the border to smooth the way for importation of 
the haitians

the contract signed by the sugar council and the haitian 
government theoretically provided for the welfare of the workers 
adequate housing electricity running water sanitary facilities 
dining areas eighthour workdays 
unfortunately most terms of the contract were never 
enforced said the october human rights report 
since the fall of the duvalier regime in 1986 haitians who are 
recruited to the plantations lack even the hypothetical protection 
of a contract 
haitians in the dominican republic are compelled to work on 
sugar plantations by physical force and by threats of 
deportation the october human rights report said it said 
workers were often locked in their barracks at night braceros who 
refused to cut cane were sometimes beaten or jailed and 
undocumented haitians living elsewhere in the dominican republic 
were rounded up by the army and forced to work on the plantations 
dominican historian frank moya pons director of the study 
commissioned by the sugar council said recommendations on how 
conditions could be improved were first presented to the council in 
1984 
it is my impression that conditions have worsened in the years 
since the report was presented said moya pons who now teaches 
at the university of florida 
haiti and the dominican republic are negotiating a new contract 
calling for 28000 braceros who would be given individual work 
contracts providing for decent living and working conditions 
vinas caceres of the state sugar council says he wants a 
contract with haiti that would guarantee humane just treatment 
im taking action against anyone who mistreats the workers 
he says slapping his desk for emphasis 
as an example vinas caceras says he had ordered the dismissal 
of a supervisor at the haina plantation who was accused of forcing 
haitians to leave church on sunday to cut cane 
a reporter who visited the plantation however found that the 
supervisor fernando sanchez was still on the job and had locked 
up five haitians 
interviewed through the bars of a window the men said they had 
eaten only bread and sugar for three days they said they lived in 
the town of boca chica and were returning from a visit to haiti 
when a haina plantation bus picked them up and delivered them to 
sanchez 
mercedes reyes the plantation superintendent said the haitians 
might be thieves or drug runners and would be turned over to the 
police he said sanchez was an exemplary employee and there was no 
reason to transfer him for forcing people to work on sunday 
the harvest comes first reyes declares here everyone 
works seven days a week including me 
dominican churches try to assist haitians with windmills water 
pumps latrines and vegetable gardens a group called pastoral 
haitiana provides medical and legal aid 
we have repatriated 31 juveniles and 41 men and women so far 
this season who were either underage sick or had been tricked or 
forced to work against their will says the rev edwin paraison 
an anglican priest who runs pastoral haitiana with three other 
priests 
driving down a dusty trail deep in the consuelo plantation on 
the southwest coast paraison braked to pick up a boy who appeared 
to be an underage worker he gave his name as arnold petion and 
said he was 16 and had been in the dominican republic only seven 
days 
later seated in a church office in the same school uniform he 
wore when he left haiti the boy said a recruiter promised a soft 
job with good pay 
when i arrived he said the oldtimers told me i had been 
sold along with everyone else here

editors note they are the mole people living underground 
in a railroad tunnel foraging manhattans garbage cans for food 
robert negron and bernard monte isaac wouldnt have it any other 
way life on the surface just didnt work out for them

in an underground railroad tunnel the width of a 
football field in a place so scary that amtrak workers once were 
assigned shotguntoting escorts about 40 homeless people are 
making a life 
to the sound of automobiles rumbling overhead robert negron and 
bernard monte isaac emerge from the abandoned railroad shacks in 
which they sleep 
they stand near a campfire where they cook and boil water to 
wash and clean clothes they seem almost like bedraggled boy scouts 
until they start talking about life in the tunnel 
some call it the tunnel of doom its inhabitants the mole 
people 
a lot of people are intrigued by our existence down here 
isaac says whats so amazing what are we supposed to do come 
down here to die 
this is the perfect environment for one to grow in 
negron 38 and isaac 36 have chiseled out an existence in the 
tunnel that stretches from 72nd street to 125th street along 
riverside park on manhattans upper west side 
they read by candlelight and occasionally cook gourmet meals 
the tunnel walls are adorned with murals 
but they also struggle to survive amid violence isaac once 
found a body in the tunnel and a woman who lived near his shack 
was raped 
underground trolls once demanded that isaac pay them tribute to 
pass through their territory he reacted violently he was the lord 
of the tunnel he shouted and they backed off he has held that 
title ever since 
one will either grow or retard theres no middle of the road 
its a very dangerous place says isaac who holds a 
seconddegree black belt in karate this tunnel scares the hell 
out of the machoest of men 
amtrak worker bill maccioli says he and other workers were so 
frightened when they first entered the twotrack tunnel in 1987 
that railroad police carrying shotguns were sent along with them 
for eight months 
the tunnel connected nowabandoned rail yards west of lincoln 
center to the new york central tracks north along the hudson river 
it has not been used for eight years amtrak plans to resume 
service on the tracks soon but the railroad will have to contend 
with the estimated 30 to 50 people who live there 
they are there by choice all had lives above ground isaac 
claims he has a degree in journalism from the university of 
maryland and negron says he lived on staten island with his wife 
and 16yearold son 
it always seemed like no matter what i got into i wasnt 
comfortable there negron says my emotions always got 
involved i felt shy or guilty 
negron a former drug addict was among the first to seek refuge 
in the tunnel in the early 1980s in the beginning he was scared 
and ashamed 
when people were on the tracks i would put out the candles 
and would wait for them to leave he says its like living 
in a mens shelter when you go to sleep at night you have to tie 
your shoes with knots so that when you wake up in the morning you 
still have them 
when someone set his cubbyhole on fire he moved about 20 blocks 
uptown met isaac and resettled in a 10by20foot shack that he 
keeps padlocked 
there is a bed a refrigerator to store food at room 
temperature chest of drawers food locker a hamper clothing on 
hangers a rug candles and a suitcase 
my happiest moment is when i go inside the room light the 
candle and sit down and read negron says 
for isaac too the happiest moments come when he has a full 
stomach and climbs under the sheets nice and warm and tucked in 
and dream im at peace with myself and theres no knock at my 
door 
he says he passes the time by working on a book writing songs 
and planning a documentary that he claims a european television 
station is interested in im a dreamer isaac says 
isaac and negron redeem cans and bottles for the cash they need 
and hunt through garbage cans for food scraps on a recent haul 
isaac came back with 127 unopened cans of food he found thrown away 
by a supermarket 
im not really in no pain negron says i get what i need 
and im satisfied i just walk down the streets and i find what i 
need 
you actually can exist from the waste of man and its probably 
one of the few cities you can get away with that in isaac says 
we eat as we choose down here we live as well if not better than 
the average people up top 
they note that they are literally surrounded by art murals 
created by artists like chris pape pape who is not homeless says 
art is kind of neat when its tucked away like that and you kind 
of stumble upon it 
a painting of mona lisa lights up when sunlight streaks through 
grates above other portraits feature ted williams woody guthrie 
michelangelos david robert kennedy the rev martin luther 
king jr and a break dancer 
negron has all of this and liquor too 
ive got me and my bottle the best company i have he says 
at least now i have a lot more peace of mind i dont have no 
anger in me to strike back at anybody i dont blame anybody for 
anything 
is isaac envious of the rest of the world 
ive had the opportunity to get jobs he says i dont 
choose to be a robot within the system theres not enough money 
they could pay me to become another person every day whats 
important is when i look in the mirror i like who i see 
weve done something that one out of every 1000 men in 
creation in their lifetimes will do we dared to be ourselves

editors note the aids scare probably has a lot to do with it 
and religious training certainly does but there are a lot of 
people out there just saying no to sex before marriage now theres 
a support group for them the national chastity association 
founded by a divorced mother of two 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the sexual revolution has spawned a group of 
counterrevolutionaries adults committed to celibacy before 
marriage 
bucking societal trends more than 400 men and women of varied 
ages and backgrounds have found a haven in the national chastity 
association 
some members have never had sex but others have been married 
many say they didnt join for any religious or moral reasons 
theyre just fed up with the singles bar scene and empty 
relationships 
many admit theyve had a difficult time convincing others they 
are not weirdos 
ive been humiliated ridiculed laughed at made fun of 
says jance hodge a 30yearold from holbrook mass who has never 
dated and believes in premarital chastity because it was the way 
my mother brought us up 
when she heard about the group i was totally psyched because 
i was saying to myself there are finally other virgins out there 
besides me 
elaine marsh a 35yearold legal secretary from orange county 
near los angeles found her new husband through the group 
they began corresponding in november and first decided to get 
married this may but impatience intervened and they eloped on 
march 30 one day after they had met each other in person for the 
first time 
when you cant do certain things before you get married you 
want to hurry up ms marsh says 
she says neither was disappointed 
were discovering more and more things in common she says 
its great 
ms marsh had been single since her divorce six years ago three 
years ago she became celibate 
it comes from my religion but its more than that she 
says i just feel its such a precious part of yourself you 
dont give it to someone when you havent made the commitment of 
marriage 
the decision wasnt an easy one 
i had friends try and talk me out of it she says i had a 
man say to me why should i spend money on you if youre not going 
to have sex with me because 99 out of 100 women will 
the pressure became too much to handle 
i stopped dating it was that difficult she says i got 
tired of wrestling matches basically so i just said forget this 
she joined the chastity association last june 
i was really glad to see that there was actually a group that 
has the same outlook that i have she says thats pretty hard 
to find in southern california 
experts say theres no evidence of any major national trend 
toward chastity but concede the aids scare has made many some 
singles shy away from intercourse 
the national chastity association a nonreligious group 
founded less than two years ago by a divorced suburban mother of 
two functions as a kind of dating service and support group 
mary meyer 37 says she formed the group after suffering too 
many heartaches from bad nonplatonic relationships she tried 
joining a singles club and placing personal ads in local 
newspapers but failed to meet a man who shared her values 
i love handholding i love kissing i love caressing i love 
sex she says but even more than i would love to experience 
these things right now i want to be able to have a relationship 
where i can experience them forever 
convinced that the best way to find an ideal mate is to build a 
nonphysical relationship before marriage ms meyer formed the 
group based on what she calls the 19 desires 
they include the desire to save handholding kissing and sex 
until marriage and to be close friends with someone for at least 
two years before considering marriage 
members pay 15 a year and get their names published in a group 
directory that lists brief descriptions of members and their values 
lorraine althea a model in her 30s from los angeles joined 
about a year ago 
i have fooled around a lot but i just reached a point where 
id had enough and i just wanted something more she says it 
gets to the point of being boring men are after you all the time 
fear of aids had something to do with her decision but more 
than that althea says she was just tired of that shallow 
feeling 
since joining althea says shes met lots of celibate people 
you begin to feel like youre the only one but youre not 
she said were not prudes weve been around 
david dismore 43 a video archivist for feminist groups in 
southern california says chastity is the sexual revolutions 
forgotten ingredient 
some people think liberation means glorification of casual 
sex he says i think the definition of sexual liberation is 
the right to freely and comfortably say no 
clergyman joe leonard of wayne pa who is involved in a 
project on human sexuality for the national council of churches in 
christ says he sees no trend toward chastity 
i dont see any evidence of it frankly despite the 
national chastity association he says 
neither does jerome sherman a houston psychologist and 
president of the american association of sex educators counselors 
and therapists 
we dont find that more people are saying no to sexual 
activity sherman says 
the question is not should you have any sexual activity before 
marriage because it depends on each individual 
in other words to each his own

editors note the boot camp approach to disciplining young 
criminals may be no more effective than conventional incarceration 
some studies suggest but in michigan prison officials are pleased 
with the results of its twoyearold camp sauble program and the 
state plans to build even more boot camps including one for women 
heres a look inside camp sauble 
</TEXT>

gary simmons a 19yearold cocky high 
school dropout with a long criminal record quakes like a 
frightened child as prison guards scream insults in his ear 
here your first name is probationer barks sgt randy winn 
youre losing everything now all that street crap 
welcome to camp sauble michigans boot camp prison 
simmons convicted of breaking and entering and two other young 
criminals who have just arrived are standing with their noses 
pressed hard against a white concreteblock wall surrounded by 
eight correctional officers all yelling at once 
an hourlong tonguelashing by guards in widebrimmed hats and 
shiny boots begins the moment the youths arrive from the county 
jail 
inspector william ray pacing before the group with his hands 
clinched behind his back speaks calmly but sternly 
i dont care how big and bad you think you are he says 
we think of you as nothing but puke 
minutes later the probationers heads are shaved they are 
forced to clean their own hair off the floor as the yelling 
continues 
its been two years since the first group of young men arrived 
at camp sauble for 90 days of shock incarceration a mix of 
discipline hard labor education and intimidation 
about 1150 men between the ages of 17 and 25 almost all of 
them multiple felony offenders and sentenced to at least a year in 
prison have volunteered for the probation program with a referral 
by a judge or court officer about 750 or 65 percent have 
graduated the rest wind up in conventional prisons after being 
kicked out or quitting some dont even make it through the first 
day 
they scared me so bad at intake i never thought id make 
it says christopher brown 18 of detroit who graduated march 
30 after serving a sentence for cocaine possession 
its been a long hard three months but this program has 
given me selfcontrol and discipline and taught me how to respect 
other people 
to the visitor camp sauble presents a convincing argument for 
the paramilitary approach for shaking up prisonbound youths and 
giving them a chance to straighten out their lives 
but as michigan begins to build more boot camp prisons studies 
suggest such programs may not be turning troubled lives around any 
more than prison sentences 
michigan department of corrections officials boasted a 
90percent success rate for camp sauble after the first year of 
operation compared with 70 percent of state prison parolees who 
stayed out of trouble the camp sauble parolees were watched for 
six to eight months the average length of parole for a state 
prison inmate is two years 
a followup study of camp saubles success is in the works 
but longerterm studies of similar programs in other states show 
bootcamp graduates wind up back in prison at roughly the same rate 
as those paroled from the general prison population 
if a drop in the recidivism rate is the main thing we want 
from these programs then they may not be working says doris 
mackenzie a louisiana state university professor studying the 
programs in seven states for the national institute of justice 
about 12 states have prison boot camp programs and dozens more 
are considering them 
once the youth gets back to the community and his old friends 
there are all the same pressures that were there before the 
drugs the alcohol and that draws them back mackenzie says 
no one argues however about costeffectiveness 
in michigan it costs about 4000 to keep a probationer in the 
threemonth boot camp program compared with about 22000 to house 
a state prison inmate for a year 
in addition to doubling camp saubles capacity from 120 to 240 
beds by fall the state is building another camp at cassidy lake in 
chelsea and one in schoolcraft county in the upper peninsula also 
there are plans to build one for women 
the program is being expanded from 90 to 120 days adding a 
fourweek decompression period emphasizing education over 
physical labor the probationer will still be under strict 
discipline but will receive instruction in such things as job 
hunting and parenting skills to ease the adjustment back into the 
community 
we have to make sure theyre strong enough mentally as well as 
physically to resist the peer pressure when they get back says 
deputy warden bruce curtis they have to have enough selfesteem 
enough selfcontrol to resist the drug pushers waving money at 
them 
selfcontrol is tested daily at camp sauble located in the 
manistee national forest near ludington probationers begin their 
17hour day at 5 am awakened by the sounds of trashcan lids 
clanging together like cymbals 
in addition to two hours of rigorous physical training the day 
is filled with hard labor a recent project involved pulling out 
tree stumps and smoothing a runway at the manistee airport by 
hand 
through it all the probationer speaks only when spoken to and 
the only acceptable reply to a guard is yessir 
meals are eaten in silence there is one hour of free time 
daily but the only television viewing permitted is the evening 
news there are no visitors and only weekly telephone calls 
it is attention to detail the twicedaily inspections of 
everything from the probationers foot locker to his fingernails 
that makes the program tougher than others curtis says 
some criminal justice experts are skeptical that three or four 
months of hard work and humiliation can undo a lifetime of neglect 
or abuse 
michigan state university professor merry morash says the 
programs promote aggressive behavior and ignore the roots of 
criminal behavior such as unemployment 
to try to treat this problem with a program that contains 
elements of forced labor and early wakeup calls seems naive at 
best she testified at a recent federal hearing on the programs 
but curtis is convinced the program through its toughness is 
the first evidence many of these youths have that someone cares 
the first step toward building selfesteem 
we dont expect to change the person but we can change their 
desire curtis says we can change his desires so he respects 
authority and wants to accomplish something

writer dominick dunne spends his life rubbing 
elbows with the rich and powerful and telling their secrets and 
his own to the world 
his novel people like us which has been adapted as a 
twopart tv miniseries on nbc looks at affluent people publicly 
flaunting their wealth early in the past decade it also serves as 
a means for him to deal with his own desire for revenge for the 
murder of his daughter 
an earlier novel the two mrs grenvilles was an nbc 
miniseries in 1987 his newest book an inconvenient woman is 
due to be published this month 
the parts in people like us that deal with my own life 
involve gus bailey and peach his wife says dunne thats 
taken from my own life and its emphasized more in the miniseries 
than in the book the part that deals with new york society has 
composite characters for libel reasons 
his daughter actress dominique dunne was killed by her former 
boyfriend in los angeles in 1982 shortly after she had completed 
her first movie poltergeist the former boyfriend accused of 
strangling her was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and was 
released from prison after 6 years 
in people like us which will be televised sunday and 
monday gus bailey goes to a prison hearing for his daughters 
convicted killer and shoots the man 
ive never shot anybody dunne says let me explain that 
if you go through what i went through losing my daughter you have 
strong strong feelings of revenge if youre an intelligent person 
you know you cant seek revenge in that way 
but as a novelist i could create a situation in which i could 
do in the book what i couldnt do in real life i intended for gus 
to kill the guy but when i got to that part i couldnt write it 
he wounds him and goes to prison himself for a couple of years 
dunne says writing the book helped him deal with his own 
feelings about his daughters killing he is on the board of the 
national victims association which he says is working to gain 
rights for victims equal to those of the accused killers 
dunne is also a contributing editor of vanity fair an 
arrangement that began when the magazines editor tina brown 
encouraged him to keep a journal during the trial of his daughters 
killer that was published in the april 1983 issue and became the 
first chapter in a collection of his vanity fair pieces called 
fatal charms 
the people like us miniseries stars ben gazarra as gus 
bailey and jean simmons as peach plus connie sellecca eva marie 
saint dennis farina teri polo beatrice straight paul williams 
and gary frank 
i was trying to make a comment on that period during the 
reagan years when the rich went so public and flaunted their 
money dunne says it was a pretty disgusting period it was 
fascinating to watch but you have to say whats going on here 
people were living on the streets i have no problem with people 
having money and spending it its the flaunting of it its pretty 
much calmed down 
dunne is a former president of four star the television 
production company founded by david niven dick powell and charles 
boyer later he produced such movies as the boys in the band 
the panic in needle park ash wednesday and play it as it 
lays adapted from a novel written by his sisterinlaw joan 
didion his brother is writer john gregory dunne 
his new book an inconvenient woman is about the powerful 
and the rich of los angeles he says it has to do with the 
coverup of a murder here it will probably make me as unpopular 
with the people in la but i didnt get upset when people in new 
york got mad at me over people like us 
dunne is a latecomer to writing he started his first book when 
he was 50 and didnt get published until he was 53 
i had a very interesting career but like all show business 
careers it had its ups and downs he says i began to get inner 
feelings that this wasnt it there was more to get out of me than 
i was giving one of the things as a producer that i was good at 
was working with writers i had a knack for telling a writer how to 
make a script work 
it never occurred to me that i could do this myself but one 
year my writer got an emmy for a script that i practically told him 
how to write so once i had the kids out of college i said thats 
it i moved to oregon and wrote for six months my first book the 
winners was a flop my first success was the two mrs 
grenvilles

for more than a year s epatha merkerson built 
her life and career around the piano lesson her loyalty has 
paid off 
the actress turned down work that interfered with the plays 
offandon travels from chicago to san diego to washington to los 
angeles and now new york she accepted shortterm job assignments 
to fill in the employment gaps a small movie role here a guest 
spot on television there 
its been that important merkerson says now it always 
was a dream of mine to act but i dont think i could ever have 
dreamed of this if any kid ever wants to do anything i am living 
proof that you can dream of something and have it come true 
three days before the piano lesson opened on broadway last 
month it won the pulitzer prize for playwright august wilson 
reviewers not only cheered the play but singled out merkerson for 
her portrayal of berniece a strong woman determined to keep a 
family heirloom an old upright piano from being sold 
the play part of wilsons decadebydecade chronicle of the 
black experience in america focuses on a battle between brother 
and sister the brother played by charles s dutton is determined 
to sell the piano to buy the land their ancestors worked on as 
slaves the sister wants to keep it as a reminder of their painful 
past 
i know berniece says the exuberant merkerson the opposite 
of the reserved uptight woman she plays what we have in common 
is that i am a collector too but on a small scale of black 
history i like to keep things and so does berniece i collect 
golliwogs black memorabilia 
merkerson was hired for the piano lesson without an 
audition solely on the strength of a recommendation from casting 
directors meg simon and fran kumin but she had a rapport with both 
wilson and director lloyd richards 
lloyd lets the actor create and as long as you are within the 
concept of the play that we have all been discussing and reading 
you are fine she says he trusts the people that he hires 
during the long tour wilson refined the play even changing the 
ending to have more of a resolution in the fight over that piano 
in the year and three months that ive been on the road with 
the play certain things changed every time we did it and even 
changed up until the rehearsal here for broadway merkerson says 
so its been an ongoing process and were still finding new 
things which is marvelous its still very fresh for us even 
though some people in the cast have been doing it for two years 
merkersons family from michigan wasnt in show business 
although they were very theatrical everybody played an instrument 
sang or danced 
but im the only one who actually pursued it says 
merkerson born in saginaw but raised in detroit and they sort 
of live vicariously through me she studied first at eastern 
michigan university in ypsilanti and later at wayne state in 
detroit where she focused on theater 
merkerson left wayne state for a yearlong job with a childrens 
theater in albany ny when it was over the only logical thing to 
do was come to new york she arrived in 1978 
there was lots of work then merkerson recalls people 
were really supporting small theaters i literally was able to 
support myself doing showcase work in all my years in new york 
there has been only one month when i had to take a job outside the 
theater 
merkersons first break was more than a decade ago in the 
chicago company of for colored girls who considered suicide when 
the rainbow is enuf 
the women i worked with in the for colored girls company 
gave me the most valuable advice she says they knew i was 
green and they said look no one knows you but us and your 
mother you make sure you do as much good work as you can get your 
name out there because then people will know you do good work and 
are reliable 
merkersons other work in new york includes replacing lonette 
mckee in lady day at emersons bar and grill three ways 
home and moms the story of moms mabley starring clarice 
taylor 
i recall going into an audition for a big name director of a 
film and he asked me who i studied with merkerson says i 
started naming the people i had worked with like adolph caesar 
barbara montgomery and mary alice 
my most valuable lessons have come from those actors i have 
worked with i really are the people who have 
helped me they have taught me by watching me work and my being 
able to work alongside them they are truly my teachers 
one constant throughout her career has been the actress refusal 
to change her name ffeel like those or the stage 
epatha was the name given me at birth says merkerson i 
was named for a woman who was very influential in keeping my dad in 
school 
the s stands for sharon but no one in my family calls me 
that she adds 
people have told me that my name was very difficult and that i 
should change it she says but i figure once you learn it you 
wont forget it only recently did i learn there was some meaning 
to the name a woman camay welcomed the release of 
hostage frank h reed thanked both syria and iran but said again 
we cannot rest until all hostages are free 
he called the news of reeds release by kidnappers in lebanon 
cause for joy but expressed concern about the plight of six other 
americans and 10 other westerners who remain hostage 
this is a joyous day for mr reed his family his friends and 
all americans bush said in a written statement just hours before 
his scheduled afternoon meeting with robert polhill the american 
hostage freed last week after 39 mopnths in captivity 
with mr reeds release we have six innocent americans that 
are still being held hostage in lebanon as well as the other 
foreign hostages he said their predicament weighs on our mind 
and tempers the joy we feel today 
the six americans still hostage in the middle east include terry 
anderson of the associated press he is the longest held and has 
been captive for more than five years 
as he did eight days ago when polhill was let go bush thanked 
syria and iran two states the united states has accused in the 
past of sponsoring terrorism 
once again we wish to express our gratitude to all those who 
through their efforts helped in mr reeds release said bush 
in particular we would like to thank the government of syria for 
facilitating this release we would also like to thank the 
government of iran for using its influence to help bring about this 
humanitarian step 
bush said we cannot rest however until all hostages are 
free we urge all parties who either hold hostages or have any 
influence over the hostage takers to work for the expeditious and 
unconditional release of the remaining hostages 
earlier the bush administration today dispatched a special 
recovery team to west germany to greet reed 
there was no immediate word from state department officials on 
reeds condition after 43 months in captivity 
in malden mass reeds wife fahima said she was ready to 
travel overseas as soon as i see the picture of my husband 
earlier in the day as optimism rose over the prospect of a 
release the white house said it was very hopeful that a 
hostage would be freed but it it reiterated its policy of no deals 
with the kidnappers 
reed a hostage in lebanon for 43 months was liberated by 
islamic militants and turned over to syria which played a 
middleman role for the bush administration the state department 
said in the first word of his release 
weve got confirmation that hes been released and is in 
syrian hands in lebanon said kim hoggard a state department 
spokeswoman after receiving word from the us embassy in damascus 
the state department had kept an open telephone line to the 
embassy in the expectation that reed former director of the 
lebanon international school in beirut would be liberated 
reed was seized in the lebanese capital sept 9 1986 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the state department 
hostage reception team was being dispatched to wiesbaden west 
germany where hostage reed will be taken for treatment 
amid reports in iran that the planned release follows 
extensive talks between the iranian government and the 
hostageholders fitzwater said weve had a lot of third party 
intermediary kinds of messages back and forth with iran but 
theres nothing we can point to in terms of any specific reasons 
for this release 
it is virtually impossible for us to know exactly the 
contributions of iran in these kinds of matter the spokesman 
added 
he reiterated that there will be no deals with the 
kidnappers 
we know very little about the islamic revolutionary dawn 
the group saying it would release reed fitzwater said 
at the state department ms tutwiler said the islamic dawn 
group was unknown to us before yesterdays announcement ms 
tutwiler said it is probably associated with the islamic jihad but 
added we know next to nothing about this group 
no one knows precisely what motivates the hostagetakers in 
any of their activities either in the taking of hostages or 
holding them or releasing them fitzwater said there is 
considerable speculation that iran and syria and others in that 
part of the world would like to have better relations with the 
united states the president has said goodwill begets goodwill and 
we are hopeful that indeed that is the case that they do want 
better relations 
reed 57 was director of the lebanese international school when 
he was seized from his chauffeurdriven car near the beirut airport 
on sept 12 1986 as he was driven to play golf 
the massachusetts native had lived in beirut for eight years he 
is a convert to islam married to a syrian moslem

the gods must be crazy entranced world audiences with its 
simple comedic tale of an african nomad who finds a cocacola 
bottle and transforms it into an icon 
there was a slapstick romantic subplot as well but the films 
great appeal stemmed from the character of the smiling openfaced 
actor with the impossible name of nxau 
those who embraced the film will naturally approach the gods 
must be crazy ii with misgivings sequels never equal the 
original they say the godfather ii was a rare exception 
the gods ii cant possibly approach the joy of discovering 
the delightful nxau but the new film is a creditable attempt 
combining another amusing malefemale subplot with the central 
story about nxaus search for his lost children 
jamie uys a veteran south african filmmaker composes his films 
like silent comedies jammed with sight gags they are almost 
playable without dialogue uys even uses the silentmovie technique 
of speeding up the action by undercranking the camera to 
punctuate the comedy 
his script presents three parallel and sometimes intersecting 
plots 
1 two young children of nxau accidentally land in the truck 
of some poachers racing across the desert with a cargo of elephant 
tusks the distraught father finds the trail and races after them 
day and night 
2 a new york lawyer lena farugia attends a conference in 
southern africa she takes a sightseeing flight in a tiny plane 
which crashes in the wildernesses a research zoologist hans 
strydom agrees to lead her back to civilization their journey 
encountering a series of mishaps 
3 a unita scout treasure tshabalala and a cuban soldier 
erick bowen encounter each other in the wild and wage comical 
oneonone warfare 
the stories dont always mesh neatly and some of the comedy 
bits prove tedious such as the heroines climbing up and down a 
tower to pump water but there are a few bellylaughs and nxau 
remains a captivating figure the two youngsters eiros and nadies 
are absolute wonders 
some will argue that uys could have extracted lessons in the 
senselessness of war the corruption of civilization the 
dangers to wildlife but he is an entertainer not a preacher and 
for that we can be grateful 
produced by boet troskie and released by columbia pictures 
the gods must be crazy ii is rated pg but it seems acceptable 
for all audiences running time 97 minutes

the story of a tragic love set against the moody backdrop of the 
louisiana territory is told by the artist annelouis 
girodettriosen in the funeral of atala 
the haunting oil painted around 1811 has been acquired by the 
high museum of art in atlanta this particular canvas there are 
three known versions was commissioned by the empress josephine 
wife of napoleon i for the chateau de malmaison 
the artist who was known as girodet based his work on 
atala a popular novel of the day written by francois rene de 
chateaubriand published in 1801 it told the story of chactas a 
natchez indian who was captured by an enemy tribe and condemned to 
death atala the captive wife of the tribes chie falls in love 
with chactas and helps him escape 
they wander the wilderness together not giving in to physical 
passions because atala had taken a vow of chastity rather than 
risk temptation she poisons herself and dies 
girodets neoclassical oil depicts her burial she is lowered 
half clothed with folded hands across her belly into a grave 
while a tortured chactas hugs her knees 
when the painting was first shown at the salon of 1808 it was 
enormously popular josephine liked it so much that she immediately 
commissioned a copy 
the original hangs in the louvre a small study for the painting 
hangs in the j paul getty museum in malibu calif

the sensuous 1000yearold body 
language of cambodias classical ballet will soon reach western 
audiences as the country embarks on some dance diplomacy 
beginning next month members of the national dance company will 
spend seven weeks performing in britain and the netherlands the 
group also has been invited to an arts festival in los angeles in 
september however it is uncertain whether entry will be granted 
since the united states has no ties with phnom penh 
the cultural journey is part of an effort to help cambodia out 
of international isolation and to show the world that its culture 
has not been vietnamized 
the truth is as you see it said dance director proeung 
chhieng one cannot change ones soul the vietnamese have their 
culture and we have ours as he spoke young dancers went through 
a rigorous practice session at the university of fine arts weaving 
hands swaying hips and gliding across the floor to tell stories of 
bygone loves and wars 
graduates of such training are to make their first trip to the 
west since the early 1970s when the ussanctioned lon nol 
government held power the khmer rouge reign of terror all but 
eradicated the classical dance 
the foreign tours are seen by knowledgeable observers as small 
steps toward international recognition by a government that most of 
the world shuns in favor of a guerrilla coalition led by prince 
norodom sihanouk 
domestically the general revival of traditional arts has 
probably helped the communist vietnaminstalled regime to gain 
some popularity and buttress its claim of fostering cambodian 
nationalism 
vietnam which invaded cambodia and ousted the khmer rouge in 
early 1979 unquestionably has had a significant effect on the 
countrys political course but cambodians stridently maintain its 
powerful neighbor has not debased or even influenced their 
culture 
at the university for example the only discernible vietnamese 
influence are a few teachers of western instruments such as the 
accordion and violin there are reportedly as yet no qualified 
cambodians for these instruments 
the sihanoukled coalition which includes the khmer rouge and 
others have claimed cambodia is the target of vietnamese cultural 
imperialism 
while independent observers including western aid agency 
officials based in phnom penh discount such charges they note the 
state and communist party make use of culture and put limits on 
artistic expression 
minister of culture chheng phon stressed it was the duty of 
artists and intellectuals to support good leaders and help 
fight against the khmer rouge 
despite censorship of the media the former actor and music 
scholar claimed more artistic freedom existed under the current 
government than those of lon nol or sihanouk who ruled cambodia 
first as king and then head of state 
he said satires mocking official corruption and lust for power 
currently being performed would certainly have been banned in 
sihanouks time 
in an interview the minister said the past decade had seen the 
rebirth of traditional culture from the khmer rouge era the next 
phase he said would emphasize unleashing the gray matter 
creating something not just preserving how far this can go in a 
country at war and under oneparty control remains to be seen 
william labban an australian ethnomusicologist helping the 
ministry said there was nothing in phnom penh that could be 
described as an intellectual community there are no literary 
magazines and little printing of any material 
its a vacuum and it cant be filled while there is a war 
going on you need money and leisure before it can happen he 
said 
but labban and others say the revival of traditional culture has 
been impressive given the meager resources and the physical 
depredations and slaughter of artists teachers and other 
intellectuals by the ultraradical khmer rouge 
today the country has three archaeologists two architects 
three veteran teachers of the classical dance and not a single 
skilled librarian the national library is still reeling from the 
wholesale destruction of books by the khmer rouge and the national 
museum home of priceless statuary is beset by swarms of bats and 
electrical fixtures from the early 1920s 
despite cambodias political isolation some foreign assistance 
has trickled in from the belgian government un childrens fund 
private australian agencies and cornell university in ithaca ny 
judy ledgerwood a cambodia scholar from cornell is literally 
stopping cambodian culture from being eaten up by purging palm leaf 
manuscripts of destructive insects the literary and religious 
texts inscribed on palm leaves are also being microfilmed and 
stored in special containers 
angkor wat one of the worlds architectural masterpieces is 
being restored by indian experts but most other structures from 
cambodias golden age between the 9th and 13th centuries are in 
urgent need of care 
music the dance and other arts were traditionally passed down 
from teacher to student rather than recorded for posterity but the 
violence and chaos of recent decades has severed these fragile 
links 
to assist in some sort of preservation labban is training 
students to record old music and the fine arts university is 
videotaping classical dances that have been reconstructed from the 
fading memories of the few surviving authorities

carly simon has been working hard these days 
doing everything from singing standards dressed in glamorous gowns 
to writing songs to recording two albums scoring a film and 
writing childrens books 
she has a sense of achievement and shes looking forward to 
summer like a kid let out of school 
her newest album my romance has 11 standards plus a new 
song cowritten by simon what has she got arista records 
intends to release it with a record of her own songs that will come 
out next fall 
some of those written around her birthday will be about the 
passing of time it will include fishermans song which sounds 
like a folk song and has judy collins and lucy simon singing 
backup and have you seen me lately a tune simon wrote for 
meryl streep to sing in mike nichols upcoming film postcards 
from the edge 
simon did a home box office special in april with harry connick 
jr as her guest he played piano on some songs and performed some 
duets 
we only went through them once and it sounds as if weve been 
singing together our whole lives simon said it was magical 
hes one of the most talented people ive ever met he sings like 
frank sinatra and plays piano like thelonius monk 
on may 6 she sang a few songs with connick in his show at the 
new orleans jazz and heritage festival 
simon recently watched a video of the onehour special for the 
first time because she had been afraid to watch it she thought 
their duet i dont know why i love you like i do was very 
sexy 
but she was winging it with her onstage patter i hate 
hearing myself i feel embarrassed they left them in they felt it 
lends a sort of downtoearth quality 
for the album she and pianist michael kosarin went through 
piles and piles of songs deciding which were best for my voice 
winding up with six by richard rodgers then marty paich arranged 
for orchestra and conducted 
i cant imagine anybody treating those songs more sensitively 
and romantically simon said the record was made in three days 
four songs a day 
she spent one week before the hbo special was shown in scoring 
postcards from the edge 
fortunately i was able to mobilize everything in my head and 
work with a sense of urgency panic and drama it was very much 
like studying for the exam when you havent done the work all 
semester 
i think i wrote a great song for meryl to sing opening the 
picture she sings two other songs you dont know me the old 
ray charles song and one shel silverstein wrote 
the same week she and doubleday editor jacqueline onassis 
finished work on her childrens book for next christmas the boy 
of the bells her first childrens book was amy the dancing 
bear out for christmas 1989 im going to put out one a year 
probably for the rest of my life 
her husband jim hart who can be seen in the audience at the 
special is finishing a novel 
sipping a big mug of tea during an interview simon talked about 
jackie o 
she had great suggestions she helped me enormously she 
said the thing i love about her is that she didnt want to 
tighten it up or take any of my personality out of it the other 
thing i feel is that her work thrills her she doesnt do it dryly 
or coldly she is perfect for an artistic type of person if i feel 
like im just taking up somebodys time i just feel awful 
she didnt do this editing on amy that landed on her desk 
almost perfect i must have told that 1000 times to sarah and ben 
this i started from scratch on a day in the sun when i felt like 
thinking up a new story it wasnt honed the way amy was 
when her children sarah called sally 15 and ben 13 were 
young simon made up stories for them 
i loved doing it i very rarely read to them because they 
seemed to go to sleep better if all the lights were out she said 
amy is a budding aritst that was a story that sally 
particularly loved ben was quite angry that i didnt dedicate it 
to him as well she dedicated the boy of the bells a 
christmas story to him 
the reason she wrote down amy and some of her other bedtime 
stories wasnt to publish but so she wouldnt forget them i knew 
when i had grandchidren the kids would say remember the one you 
used to tell about amy my memory would be completely gone by that 
time 
in her musical future simon wants to sing both her own songs 
and standards she wrote fishermans song in 20 minutes after 
coming home late from recording and finding ben asleep i smelled 
his neck and kissed his eyelids things he doesnt let me do 
because hes 13 i translated that to an unrequited love situation 
a girl sneaks into a loved ones house and lies beside him it 
sounds like an old english folk song it shows another style of 
mine i feel equally at home in 
simon made one previous album of standards torch in 1981 
everybody gives linda ronstadt credit for having gone back and 
done the standards i always felt jealous she got all the credit 
for it

patricia volk writes fiction and nonfiction 
often at the same time 
she calls her short stories riffs narratives proudly made 
up as she goes along but even volk knows you cant avoid injecting 
a little truth in fiction thats why she tears out pages from the 
newspapers and circles articles of interest just in case 
one day for instance she read about syzygy which means 
the earth sun and moon are in rare alignment months later 
syzygy became the title of a story included in her collection 
all it takes 1795 atheneum 
i was writing this story and i had a character press up 
against her exlover for the last time and i thought oh my god 
this is like syzygy every part connects explained volk 
and i thought where is that article i wondered whether 
people could line up like planets and i started rewriting it from 
that most of my characters are struggling for some kind of 
alignment but they cant find a syzygy its very rare that you 
can 
volk whose essays appear frequently in the new york times 
wrote the novel white light 
she can turn anything into a story thats how the manhattan 
resident became a writer ten years ago there was an incident at 
the playground with one of her two children and she couldnt stop 
describing it to friends before long the story was so polished 
volk decided to put it into writing 
i tell people all the time that the only difference between 
those who sell and those who dont sell are those who dont send it 
out she said some of the best writers dont send their work 
out theyre afraid of rejection its too much trouble theyre 
not sure they like it 
volk cant resist applying a little creativity to real life 
the stain from a spilled cup of coffee gets a little bigger that 
delay on the subway becomes a little longer encounters with 
strangers keep getting more interesting 
your memory plays tricks on you volk said any incident 
is like rashomon play that coffee spill back and its entirely 
different i think i bring a lot of fiction writing to the essay in 
terms of taking leaps and nuance i think of something that might 
distort it but it gives it a personal feel 
volks characters are often in danger of losing their lives in 
thought trying to impose order on events as logical as the daily 
horoscope in reckless dreamer a woman reflects on the 
personality of her former lover 
he was an editor and lived the most censurious life she knew 
he criticized things other people never thought about labels on 
cans the wording on menus how people sat he even criticized her 
syntax and her dreams if shed stayed with him he would have 
criticized her into the ground 
in which is better del analyzes everything from sex to 
lemonade thinks too much but cant for the life of her stop is 
included in a list of things she doesnt like about herself 
in the title story of all it takes lucy is so unhappy that 
she writes letters to the artist georgia okeeffe seeking advice 
from an expert on the meaning of life 
i think my characters are straddling a fence volk said 
on one side theyre powerless and on the other side theyre 
rationalists theyre trying to make sense of things 
lucy is really quite on the edge shes trying to maintain her 
equilibrium with those letters to georgia okeeffe but when youre 
needy and youre feeling terribly you look for answers in 
everything if its a painter and you move yourself to bounce 
ideas off a dead person fine 
volk who grew up in manhattan and long island had plenty time 
to think as a child when her older sister was born her 
grandfather quit his job to spend time with the baby fortunately 
volk says her birth was less eventful 
secondborn children are different less is expected of them 
and less time is devoted to them its a very nurturing thing for a 
writer because theres less time physically for you you dont have 
that intensity beamed on you 
she worked full time with writing squeezed in during lunch 
hours but volk made the best of it managing to compose 11 drafts 
of white light with the help of daily trips to a nearby coffee 
shop 
id get the coffee id get the egg salad and the cheese and 
id go to the library and it was so wonderful she recalled 
the whole process was like anne tyler sharpening her pencils 
before she crosses the threshhold into the room where she writes 
having quit her job and with the kids in school volk can write 
all the time now the routine is simple just grab a cup of coffee 
sit down and get to work but writing remains mysterious what 
volk might call a yellow banana something that doesnt turn 
out the way its expected 
writing the essay i kind of know what i think up front and i 
can ask questions of my reader but i dont know what i think up 
front at all writing fiction 
its a real kind of discovery process for me i do it with the 
unsensitive part of my brain the sensitive part of my brain comes 
later when i try to make sense of things

awardwinning country star ricky van 
shelton describes music as the voice of the soul 
it just grabs hold of me the 38yearold singer says a 
beautiful melody just picks me up and carries me away 
shelton the reigning country music association male vocalist of 
the year has had six no 1 country music singles in the past three 
years his rvs iii has been a no 1 album on the country music 
charts this spring 
singing has always been a part of life for shelton who spent 10 
years as a pipe fitter and plumber before launching a fulltime 
music career and it always will be 
if it ends today ill be playing at my friends house friday 
night and having a ball he said ive always done it i 
couldnt live without it i play all the time early in the 
morning and late at night 
shelton a star on the grand ole opry left his home in grit 
va two days after christmas in 1984 and moved to nashville in 
1987 he burst onto the national country music scene with the album 
wildeyed dream both it and his second lp loving proof 
were million sellers 
his hit singles include ill leave this world loving you 
somebody lied life turned her that way living proof 
statue of a fool dont we all have the right and from a 
jack to a king 
hes one of nashvilles most active singers hitting the road 
for more than 200 shows a year 
i dont count em he said in an interview on a rare day off 
the bus that carries him throughout the country we stay gone all 
the time 
still playing his guitar on stage and performing with his 
sixpiece band is the supreme satisfaction of his profession he 
says 
when im on stage for an hour a night im the happiest man in 
the world that hour makes up for the other 23 i live for that 
hour on stage when you get home you cant wait to get back out 
again it gets in your blood 
for the past three years shelton has been living out his dream 
singing hit records selling millions of albums performing twice 
on the tonight show starring johnny carson and receiving some 
of the top awards in country music its been the fulfillment of 
his vision that began when he sang gospel music in church by age 3 
but theres also been a down side 
its been a wonderful wonderful experience and im still 
happy but when you have big success you have big problems he 
said i never have time for myself any more or my friends or my 
family i dont have any privacy any more there are all kinds of 
decisions to make i dont get to go fishing any more 
it success has brought me happiness but you dont have time 
to enjoy it its kind of a paradox 
sometimes he misses his days in southcentral virginia where he 
worked at one time or another as a car salesman appliance store 
manager grocery store clerk and house painter his main jobs 
however were as a plumber and pipe fitter making 5 to 10 an hour 
its a real highly skilled craft to make that stuff work and 
fit i miss the challenge of that and the camaraderie of the guys 
you work with all day long them guys work hard 
it was a very satisfying job when you got through and it was 
nice to see it operate i enjoyed welding and cutting things with 
the cutting torch and getting dirty and i got dirty 
shelton is often compared to randy travis who also broke into 
country music about the same time singing a similar style of 
traditional country music 
being compared to randy thats flattery hes been super 
successful 
dont expect to find a lot of lyrics in sheltons songs 
i dont like a song with a lot of words in it too many words 
kills the thought

medical ethicist daniel callahan was criticized 
for picking on old people in his 1987 book about setting limits on 
medical treatment for the elderly 
this time he may get criticism from more quarters 
in his new book what kind of life the limits of medical 
progress callahan deals on a broader scale with the same 
problem how to rein in the demand for unending efforts to defeat 
illness and death and the unending costs involved 
callahan argues that americans will have to accept limits on 
medical treatment if there is to be any hope of holding down costs 
this could mean denying expensive hightechnology treatments to 
those beyond a certain age as well as to other patients on the 
ragged edge of medical progress 
there should be a great reluctance to use curative 
lifeextending technology in the care of the critically ill likely 
terminal or irreversibly declining patient unless there is a 
strong probability of a good longterm outcome callahan writes 
a society would be well justified in the future to set an 
age limit on the public provision of expensive lifeextending 
curative healthcare according to the book 
we will probably have to set limits of one kind or another for 
all age groups he said in a recent interview 
the suggestion of an age cutoff is perhaps his most 
controversial 
itll never happen it shouldnt happen its a mistaken 
idea said one critic harry r moody of the brookdale center on 
aging at hunter college in new york 
callahan 59 is cofounder and director of the hastings center 
a research and educational organization that studies ethics in 
medicine and biology 
currently he said decisions on allocating health care 
resources are made on a casebycase basis and im arguing that 
well probably have to do it by categorical standards that is to 
say we might have to use age as a way of setting a limit 
one way to accomplish this would be to set age cutoffs for 
medicare reimbursement for example deny payment for heart bypass 
surgery chemotherapy or other expensive drug treatments to 
patients over a certain age perhaps 80 or 85 
this said callahan would not mean abandoning the sick he 
advocates increased emphasis on caring medicine rather than 
curative medicine on goodquality longterm care at home and 
in institutions on relieving pain and suffering rather than merely 
prolonging life 
what im looking for is a kind of tradeoff we need to 
improve longterm and home care and one of the prices we may 
have to pay is to put some limits on that expensive hightech 
curative medicine 
in effect what we have to do is say look folks you cant 
have it all 
moody argues that an age cutoff is neither desirable nor 
politically possible 
when callahan gets into specifics like cutting off care for 
people beyond age 85 i say no because it isnt going to happen and 
its distracting from the real issues moody said in an interview 
limits on treatment for terminal or critically ill patients 
already exist in the regulations governing medicare reimbursements 
and in the standards and protocols followed by doctors and can be 
tightened moody said 
it could very well be that the medical community would develop 
a practice for example of not giving dialysis to people in the 
end stage of alzheimers disease but thats different from saying 
its against the law to do so moody said 
with a standard practice someone who wants to deviate from 
the practice can always do so he said as the system gets 
squeezed for money doctors will routinely try to discourage 
families from having socalled heroic treatments but they might 
not succeed and the family might say no give him one more year 
of life 
that tendency to cling to life whatever the cost is part of 
the problem callahan said advances in technology have made it 
harder for patients families and doctors to accept death 
in looking at the problem of escalating health care costs in the 
united states callahan focused first on the elderly because the 
future of health care in this country belongs to the elderly in 
the sense that most people will die beyond the age of 65 
weve done awfully well in eliminating the things that kill 
people earlier in life 
the government in march reported that life expectancy in the 
united states had reached a record 75 years up from 629 years in 
1940 
this has led to increased emphasis in research and in 
treatment on battling diseases of old age and extending lives 
still longer and the costs keep growing 
medicare alone is expected to cost 104 billion this year 
about onetwelfth of the federal budget and grow to 183 billion 
by 1995 the medicare trust fund could be bankrupt by the turn of 
the century unless costs are curbed its trustees reported last 
month 
callahan sees the pursuit of longer and longer lifespans as an 
open endless frontier given the fact that the body ultimately 
ages and dies theres no end to the amount of money that can be 
spent to continue caring for the elderly 
but there is a limit to the amount of money that can or should 
be made available for this battle callahan argued society and 
government must weigh this commitment against its other priorities 
otherwise he said the endless pursuit of better health and 
longer lives can use resources needed for other worthwhile goals 
from education and child care to building roads and fighting crime 
it is reasonable for us as patients to ask our neighbor as 
a taxpayer to care for us if we cannot care for ourselves 
callahan wrote we cannot ask that neighbor for an ultimate cure 
of disease or to relieve us of the burden of having bodies that 
age and die and we cannot ask the medical profession or the 
political order for that kind of benefit either

the graying of america will be mirrored in other 
countries including the soviet union which has sent three 
scientists to northwestern university to collaborate on research 
into aging 
the pressing issues are how best to deal with the medical 
needs of the elderly without bankrupting the country and how 
to maintain their dignity and humanity while we provide them with 
what they need said dr james r webster jr director of the 
center on aging at northwesterns mcgaw medical center 
the soviets will stay in chicago for collaboration on projects 
lasting one to three months and researchers from northwestern 
which initiated the idea for the program will travel to kiev later 
this year for like endeavors 
the visits are part of an agreement between northwesterns 
center on aging and the soviets institute of gerontology of the 
academy of medical sciences the equivalent of the us national 
institute on aging 
chicago is one of the birthplaces of gerontology and kiev is 
the most important city in the soviet union for that study said 
celia berdes associate director of the center on aging 
as an exchange participant she will look at the soviets system 
of elderly care 
according to webster one major difference between us and 
soviet elderly care is that the united states generally emphasizes 
hightech medical approaches 
us stroke victims for example typically undergo 
computerenhanced xrays and studies of electrical impulses in the 
brain while the soviets tend to direct resources to 
rehabilitiation he said 
they would probably have more intensive and prolonged therapy 
for the restoration of function more emphasis on getting them 
back into their homes webster said 
not surprisingly the soviet researchers who have come to 
chicago will be trying to learn some of americas hightech 
methods he said 
nataliya bachinskaya a neurologist will work for three months 
with john de gabrieli assistant professor of psychology on how 
thinking processes change in people who have had strokes and 
related ailments 
were also interested in how we can improve the functional 
activity of the brains of old persons ms bachinskaya said 
yuri jaroshenko an internist will work for one month with 
arthur atkinson director of pharmacology and richard davison 
chief of cardiology on a study of how heart drugs work in the 
elderly 
yuri rushkevich a physiologist will work for one month with 
john disterhoft associate professor of cell biology and anatomy 
in a study of learning in aged animals

few retirees have access to companysponsored 
health insurance and many of those who do are seeing their benefits 
shrink as businesses try to control skyrocketing costs a 
government report says 
although seen as a lowcost employee benefit decades ago 
retiree health coverage has now become a major concern for 
companies because retiree health costs have risen and are expected 
to continue to increase dramatically in the future the general 
accounting office reported 
more than 5 million retired americans are covered by such health 
plans of whom 2 million are under 65 the gao said private health 
coverage is particularly important for younger retirees because 
people do not become eligible for medicare health benefits until 
age 65 
the gao study was conducted at the request of rep edward r 
roybal dcalif who chairs the house select committee on aging 
the mission was to find out what was happening to health 
coverage for retirees said gary christopherson the committees 
director of health legislation now that the study has been 
completed its not as clear that we know what we want to do 
he said 
at this point congress is not clear uired contributions from retirees 
under 
65 and 53 percent passed on part of the cost to retirees 65 and 
over the gao added 
christopherson said the few options congress has available could 
have negative side effects for instance he said if employers 
were required to provide health coverage for retirees or congress 
tried to make it easier for them to do so the quality of existing 
plans could suffer 
no matter what you gain youre going to lose as much in 
return he said theres a risk involved 
the gao said some companies providing retiree health care 
coverage might drop the plans if the financial accounting standards 
board follows though with a plan to require corporations to show 
future costs on their balance sheets the fasb is an independent 
agency that sets accounting standards for private companies

a graying america requires professionals 
better equipped to deal with health care problems of the elderly 
say publishers of a new reference manual geared toward just that 
the merck manual of geriatrics is oriented toward medicine 
disease and even health of the aged said dr p roy vagelos 
president and chief executive officer of merck amp co the rahway 
njbased pharmaceuticals company that published the book in april 
it follows in the tradition of the merck manual first published 
in 1899 a standard reference on symptoms and diseases 
the 1300page manual on geriatric medicine describes symptoms 
and suggests treatments for older patients merck sells the 
handbook at cost 20 company officials said 
topics include malnutrition sleep disorders falls fractures 
incontinence acute confusion and geriatric emergencies 
despite the aging of the population medical schools offer 
little training in specialized treatments for older patients dr 
william b abrams coeditor of the manual 
recent statistics for people completing their internships show 
that only about 4 percent were able to say that in their medical 
training they had what was quoted as an extensive experience in 
geriatrics meaning a twoweek exposure he said 
abrams said physicians must adjust their approach when treating 
elderly patients 
the fact of the matter is that yes many physicians 
internists have taken care of older people but one definition of 
experience is making the same mistake over and over he said 
people over 65 make up 12 percent of the nations population 
but use 30 percent of health care services vagelos said by the 
year 2000 the over65 population will grow to 20 percent and will 
use about 50 percent of health care services

reported cases of elder abuse rose 12 percent in 
massachusetts last year reflecting a steady increase over five 
years a state official said 
according to the study reports of elder abuse and neglect 
increased to 3094 for the year ended june 30 1989 compared to 
2769 cases the previous year 
reported cases in the 1984 fiscal year totaled only 1529 so 
the latest statistics represent an increase of 102 percent within 
six years 
for every report of abuse or neglect we receive we know that 
there are many others who suffer in silence said elder affairs 
secretary paul j lanzikos 
but lanzikos donna m reulbach program director for elder 
protective services and craig r fox western regional supervisor 
all said it was unclear whether the increase meant more elders were 
being abused 
reulbach said the increase may have resulted in part from a 
greater awareness among health care professionals police and 
others covered by the states mandatory reporting law 
hospitals doctors and others often were more willing to accept 
families stories that an injury to an older person resulted from 
an accident not abuse than they were for children reulbach said 
that is changing she said 
fox said he has also noticed that drugs are playing a role 
sometimes involving grandchildren seeking to extort money for drugs 
from a grandparent 
joan hatem a protective service worker and supervisor at elder 
services of the merrimack valley said alcohol also plays a role 
frequently in cases of spousal abuse 
that abuse she said may have gone unnoticed for years until 
the abused person reached age 60 and fell under the requirements of 
the reporting law 
hatem and lanzikos said sometimes the abuse is unintentional 
for example confining a confused older person to their room to 
keep them from wandering off in those cases hatem said a social 
worker can resolve the situation 
reulbach said serious abuse cases are reported to district 
attorneys for possible action 
lanzikos said his agency also recently set up a program to help 
older people threatened by selfneglect but except in cases of 
mental incompetence older people can legally reject state 
intervention fox said that happens in about 23 percent of reported 
cases 
the report covered abuse in homes and other community settings 
reports of abuse in nursing homes are handled by the department of 
public health

millions of americans have benefited from the 
social security act approved by congress in 1935 but the social 
security administration says that by the year 2048 money for the 
future may be depleted if congress continues to borrow against the 
fund 
there is strong evidence that social security might radically 
change by the time todays baby boomers reach retirement age 
because of the uncertainty about the future of social security and 
the extent to which corporations will continue to contribute to 
retirement funds for employees my advice to all consumers is to 
begin planning now for retirement 
americans are almost evenly split on the issue of whether the 
social security system will be able to pay them retirement 
benefits reponding to an employee benefit research institute and 
gallup survey 47 percent of those surveyed said they would 
probably not get a penny from the social security fund while 49 
percent expressed confidence in the system 
its interesting to note though that those with a positive 
outlook about their retirement fund tended to be 55 and older 
nevertheless only 7 percent of this age group felt that social 
security would meet all their retirement needs while 55 percent 
said the fund will provide onethird or less of their livelihood in 
the golden years 
despite this skepticism consumers are not beginning to plan for 
retirement soon enough while retirement planning was the key 
concern among clients of financial planners most clients dont 
begin retirement planning until they are 35 to 44 years old 10 
years later than most planners recommend 
there are many reasons why all consumers should begin planning 
today for retirement increased longevity rates mean we will have 
longer retirements than previous generations planning for 
longterm care and medical expenses which are rising annually at 
a rate of 20 percent to 30 percent should also be a key concern 
further because most people want to maintain the same standard of 
living they enjoyed while working money thats put away for 
retirement must account for inflation which typically increases 
45 percent annually 
i advise all consumers to take these small steps now 
participate in a companysponsored savings program most of 
which earn taxdeferred interest until retirement if you are 
selfemployed set up a keogh plan 
save at least 10 percent of income preferably 15 percent to 
20 percent 
invest in an individual retirement account or ira one of the 
few taxdeferred saving programs remaining since the enactment of 
the tax reform act 
consider taxsheltered annuities if you work for a religious 
charitable or educational organization or state university or 
public school system you may be eligible to participate in a 
taxsheltered annuity plan 
consider taxexempt or taxdeferred investments such as 
municipal bonds or singlepremium or flexiblepremium deferred 
annuities 
consider diversifying your portfolio to include stocks or real 
estate if you feel comfortable with these growth investments

friends of broccoli saddened by george 
bushs dislike of it can get a lift from another president thomas 
jefferson master gardener as well as author of the declaration of 
independence grew numerous varieties 
broccolis green purple white appear repeatedly in 
gardening notes jefferson kept throughout his life showing he was 
planting the vegetable in his own kitchen garden at monticello in 
virginia and exchanging seeds with friends 
broccoli aside anyone looking for a patron saint of gardening 
will find the perfect model in jefferson who said no occupation 
is so delightful to me as the culture of the earth and no culture 
comparable to that of the garden 
jefferson lived to age 83 statesman inventor architect 
astronomer founder of the university of virgina but despite his 
myriad activities he had time for a garden diary starting with an 
entry dated march 30 1766 when he was 22 purple hyacinth 
begins to bloom 
the burdens of the presidency did not stop him on april 6 
1804 for example he wrote sowed seeds of the east india 
asparagus in small bed sometimes he jotted garden notes on odd 
sheets of paper 
in 1808 his last year in the white house jefferson wrote to a 
friend it is now among my most fervent longings to be on my 
farm which with a garden and fruitery will constitute my 
principal occupation in retirement 
fortunately for us the nations third president left a wealth 
of material on his gardening and farming highlights of which are 
in the 704page thomas jeffersons garden book first published 
in 1944 by the american philosophical society in philadelphia the 
book was reprinted in 1985 its available through bookstores and 
at the gift shop at monticello 
its worth a trip to monticello in charlottesville va just to 
see the gardens restored more than 50 years ago by the garden club 
of virginia vegetable growers will be fascinated by the kitchen 
garden stretching 1000 feet along the sunny southern slope and 
containing more than 250 varieties including english peas 
jeffersons favorite a virginian of his times jefferson had 
slaves to help him but he was deeply troubled by the question and 
was one of the first americans to propose a plan of abolition 
through correspondence and accounts of others the garden book 
admirably annotated by edwin morris betts a biology professor at 
the university of virginia gives us rare glimpses of jefferson 
one chronicler margaret bayard smith tells us he kept a pet 
mocking bird in a cage suspended among his flowers and plants in 
his white house apartment whenever he was alone he opened the 
cage and let the bird fly about the room it would alight on

the correspondence shows us jefferson on expeditions in southern 
france and italy while he was minister to france always looking 
for varieties of such crops as rice that might do well in america 
he says for example the olive tree is least known in america 
and yet the most worthy of being known of all the gifts of heaven 
to man it is next to the most precious perhaps it may claim a 
preference even to bread because there is such an infinitude of 
vegetables which it renders a proper and comfortable nourishment 
intimate views of jefferson as gardener and farmer in his old 
age also are contained in jefferson and his time the sage of 
monticello little brown and co 1981 the sixth and final 
volume of dumas malones epic biography his previous volumes won 
the pulitzer prize for history in 1975 
the books tell us jefferson collected seeds everywhere county 
neighbors nurserymen naturalists from a friend in italy even 
from gen lafayettes aunt mrs smith who was the wife of the 
publisher of the national intelligencer visited him in his 
retirment and reported he kept his vegetable seeds in a little 
closet peas and beans were in tin canisters she said but all the 
other seeds were little phials labeled and hung on little 
hooks everything being in the neatest order 
as the years went on jefferson suffered from rheumatism but 
his spirit was not dampened as he said but though an old man i 
am but a young gardener

residents 80 and older will need 
hearing sight and driving skills tests every two years under a 
proposal in the legislature 
a law being pushed for the second year by rep marian lewis 
would require more than 300000 floridians to prove theyre not 
hazardous drivers beginning in 1991 
while ms lewis contends the measure would keep dangerous 
drivers off the road critics say the bill is discriminatory that 
argument helped kill her bill in committee last year 
in 1986 a similar bill proposed by sen jack gordon failed when 
legislators were swamped by mail from constituents opposing the 
idea 
ms lewis bill has cleared the house committee on highway 
safety and she is optimistic the measure will pass the legislature 
this year 
the people of florida favor testing elderly drivers even 
before they reach 80 lewis said the bill is such a minimal 
step toward getting unsafe drivers off our roads i think we should 
be retesting drivers starting at age 60 and im 60 
some legislators say the bill discriminates against a specific 
age group and makes no provision for transportation for those no 
longer able to drive 
i dont know why were singling out the elderly said rep 
art simons 
ms lewis noted that most accidents involving young drivers are 
due to aggressive or careless driving not deteriorating skills 
older peoples reflexes are just going to get worse she 
said if they arent competent now theyll be less so later 
indiana illinois new hampshire and the district of columbia 
require drivers to take road tests after a certain age generally 
75 new york state is considering what if anything to do about 
older drivers

the number of working us oil and natural gas 
rigs is down for the fourth straight week slipping by five in this 
weeks tally to total 927 baker hughes reported monday 
although the rig count has declined over the past three weeks 
the current total is well ahead of the 761 rigs counted at this 
time a year ago 
baker hughes rig count the widely watched industry index of 
drilling activity reflects the number of rotary rigs actively 
exploring for oil and gas as of last friday not the number of 
producing wells 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the rig count since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 
per 42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in 
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes 
began compiling figures 
among major oilproducing states louisiana and pennsylvania 
posted the largest gain with four each while north dakota and 
california each were up three 
oklahoma down seven showed the sharpest decline for the week 
with texas off four colorado and new mexico down three and ohio

the supreme court today let the government 
force thousands of transportation department employees in sensitive 
jobs to take random drug tests 
the court over one dissenting vote rejected an appeal by a 
labor union that said the tests violate the government workers 
privacy rights 
todays action is further evidence the justices are willing to 
allow widespread random drug testing of public employees 
only justice thurgood marshall voted to hear arguments in the 
case four votes are needed to grant such review 
transportation department officials approved a drugtesting 
program in 1987 for some 30000 people in jobs the agency said have 
a direct impact on public health safety or national security 
nearly twothirds of the workers who must undergo the random 
periodic urinalysis tests are air traffic controllers 
the rest hold a variety of jobs including airplane inspectors 
and mechanics traffic safety specialists and mail van drivers 
the tests were challenged by the american federation of 
government employees which represents many of the workers but not 
the air traffic controllers 
the us circuit court of appeals here ruled last september that 
the tests do not violate the employees constitutional rights 
the program is supported by sufficiently compelling 
circumstances to justify the invasions of privacy entailed the 
appeals court said 
those who test positive once for illegal drugs such as marijuana 
or cocaine generally are transferred to nonsenstive jobs if they 
test positive a second time they are fired 
the appeals court relied heavily on the supreme courts only 
drugtesting rulings in them the justices last year upheld drug 
and alcohol tests for railway workers involved in accidents and for 
us customs service employees applying for certain jobs 
but neither of those rulings determined the constitutionality of 
randomly administered drug tests 
the high court subsequently without comment rejected appeals 
challenging random tests for other public employees 
drug tests of federal workers stems from a 1986 order by 
thenpresident ronald reagan calling for a drugfree workplace the 
bush administration has endorsed the antidrug campaign 
neither the courts 1989 rulings nor the cases acted on today 
bear directly on workers in private employment 
the federal employee unions appeal said more than 345000 
government workers now are subject to drug tests that violate their 
privacy and dignity millions more who work for states or cities or 
in private employment also must submit to such tests the union 
said 
the transportation department program means that each affected 
worker will continue to be subject to random selection for the 
remainder of her worklife regardless of how often she has been 
tested how uniformly innocent her prior tests or how unblemished 
her work and health records the union said 
the case is afge vs skinner 891272

the supreme court today asked the bush 
administration for its views about oklahomas attempt to collect a 
sales tax on cigarettes and other items sold at a shawnee 
convenience store owned and run by an indian tribe 
the court said it wants to know what justice department lawyers 
think about a ruling that bars the imposition of such a tax 
a response from the government lawyers might take months and 
the justices are not expected to say whether they will review the 
case until getting that response 
the store belongs to the citizen band potawatomi indian tribe 
and is located on land held in trust for the tribe by the federal 
government 
oklahoma law requires all vendors to collect from consumers 
sales taxes of 6 or 7 percent 4 percent for the state and 2 or 3 
percent for local communities 
the state also imposes an excise tax on the sale of cigarettes 
the potawatomis have never collected sales taxes or the 
cigarette excise tax on items sold in their convenience store and 
in 1987 state officials assessed the tribe 27 million for the 
sale and distribution of untaxed cigarettes 
the tribe challenged the assessment in court and us district 
judge lee r west blocked enforcement of the cigarette tax pending 
the tribes lawsuit 
west later ruled that cigarettes sold to tribal members could 
not be taxed but that the tribe must collect taxes on cigarettes 
sold to nonmembers 
but the 10th us circuit court of appeals last november ruled 
that the tribe does not have to collect any state or local taxes on 
items sold at the store even to nonmembers 
the appeals court said oklahoma officials wrongly relied on a 
1980 supreme court ruling in a washington state case to justify the 
taxing of sales to nontribal members 
in the 1980 case the appeals court said the indian tribe had 
opted to come under state jurisdiction it said because no 
such jurisdiction exists in this case oklahomas reliance on the 
1980 decision is misplaced 
in the appeal acted on today oklahoma officials said the 
case turns on whether federal law has preempted state law or 
whether state action has infringed tribal selfgovernment 
the appeal added the state simply suggests that the tribe may 
operate its government in any way that it sees fit however if the 
tribe operates a business in the state it must obey applicable 
state laws 
the case is oklahoma tax commission vs citizen band potawatomi 
indian tribe 891322

grain and soybean futures prices were mostly 
lower in early trading today on the chicago board of trade with 
soybeans leading the decline amid forecasts for cooler wetter 
weather in the midwest 
soybean futures surged more than 30 cents a bushel last week 
partly on the belief that last weeks hot dry weather might set 
the tone for the growing season 
the drought fears were dispelled though by several forecasts 
issued late friday by the national weather service which predicted 
cooler wetter weather in the region this week and normal to 
abovenormal rainfall in the midwest from may through july 
last weeks advance in soybean prices prompted an increase in 
farmer selling of soybeans over the weekend triggering further 
selling of futures this morning analysts said 
the weather outlook is also bearish for corn futures wheat 
futures opened nearly unchanged 
in early trading wheat futures were cent lower to cent 
higher with the contract for delivery in may at 370 a bushel

digital computer corp and apple computer inc 
will announce products on tuesday that allow digital and apple 
computers to connect easily the first fruit of a 2yearold 
alliance between the companies 
through the software apple macintosh personal computers will be 
able to share computer files with digital machines to send 
messages to digital computers and to use printers hooked up to a 
digital network among other things said john rose who heads 
digitals personal computer division 
theyre all done with the macintosh friendly user interface 
said rose referring to the onscreen graphics display that makes 
the macintosh easy to use by replacing typed commands with pictures 
several outside suppliers provide software to connect apple and 
digital computers but rose said none is as comprehensive as the 
digitalapple system 
digital computers usually are connected in a network or to a 
mainframe computer while the macintosh a desktop computer 
usually is a standalone machine the software will allow companies 
using both types of machines to link them in a network 
there is a substantial audience out there for the products 
rose said 
laura conigliaro an analyst at prudentialbache securities 
inc agreed that the market for the products could be 
considerable she said there are many companies that rely on both 
digital and apple computers 
she said the products are important for apple because it needs a 
credible server or a computer that acts as the central file 
repository in a network of computers while digital needs a desktop 
computer that has wide acceptance 
it has some positive marketability for both companies she 
said 
digital based in maynard mass and apple based in cupertino 
calif announced their intention to develop the products in 
january 1988 
in the past two years digital the secondlargest computer 
company after international business machines corp has released 
products that allow ibm computers to be linked with digital 
machines 
ms conigliaro said the delay in releasing the appledigital 
products probably is due to the kind of things that go on when 
companies are big and bureaucracy is the modus operandi 
linking computers from various makers is becoming increasingly 
popular as the computer industry moves from proprietary or 
companyspecific computers and software to machines and software 
that adhere to industrywide standards

a recent london stock exchange rule change that 
allows for a delay in reporting large trades is anticompetitive 
the office of fair trading said monday 
sir gordon borrie directorgeneral of fair trading said the 
24hour delay in reporting large deals deprives the market of 
information that could affect the price of stocks 
it also gives trading opportunities to those market makers 
involved in the deals which are denied to their competitors borrie 
said 
the exchange decided in early 1989 to postpone the reporting of 
trades of over 100000 pounds or 164000 until 24 hours after 
completion of the transaction 
market makers had complained that instantaneous publication of 
large share deals on the stock exchange automated quotation system 
spoiled liquidity and led to volatility in share prices 
borrie said he had not uncovered any evidence that liquidity was 
affected or that the delay reduced volatility 
the directorgeneral sent his report to trade secretary nicholas 
ridley to decide what action if any the government should take

ltv corp reported a 42 percent decrease in first 
quarter earnings monday blaming lower profits from its steel and 
defense industries 
the dallasbased company which is operating under bankruptcy 
court protection said earnings for the quarter ended march 31 were 
442 million or 29 cents per share compared with 766 million 
or 54 cents a share for the same period last year revenues 
dropped to 149 billion from 161 billion 
steel profits fell from 871 million to 411 million while 
earnings from missile and electronics slipped from 66 million to 
62 million energy products income grew from 1 million to 17 
million 
the aircraft products group which makes parts of the b2 
stealth bomber lost 43 million in the quarter compared with a 
251 million loss last year 
chairman raymond a hay said the decline in steel profits was 
caused by higher costs lower selling prices and lower volume 
ltv filed for protection under chapter 11 of the federal 
bankruptcy code in 1986 and plans to emerge as a much smaller 
company although no reorganization plan has been filed ltv 
already has sold off much of its steel operations 
the bankruptcy filing also is the basis for a key supreme court 
case over the companys claim that it cannot afford to pay pension 
benefits leaving the federal insurance fund pensions benefit 
guaranty corp liable for 23 billion 
a decision on that case is expected by the end of june hay said

soybean futures prices closed slightly lower 
monday on the chicago board of trade amid profit taking after last 
weeks big gains wheat futures rose strongly on frost fears while 
corn futures ended mixed 
soybean futures surged more than 30 cents a bushel last week 
partly on speculation that last weeks hot dry weather might set 
the tone for the growing season 
the drought fears were dispelled though by national weather 
service forecasts for cooler wetter weather in the region this 
week and normal to abovenormal rainfall in the midwest from may 
through july 
the main feature was a little profittaking said victor 
lespinasse a grain futures trader with dean witter reynolds in 
chicago 
wheat futures prices rose amid concerns about the possibility of 
freezing temperatures in the central plains this week although 
many do not expect temperatures to fall enough to significantly 
damage the kansas winter wheat crop 
the agriculture departments weekly export inspections report 
released after the close indicated last weeks loadings of wheat 
and soybeans for export were above market expectations which could 
prompt some buying in those markets on tuesday 
at the close wheat futures were 2 cents to 5 cents higher with 
the contract for delivery in may at 372 a bushel corn was 1 
cents lower to 1 cents higher with may at 281 a bushel oats 
were 1 cents to 3 cents higher with may at 165 a bushel 
soybeans were 1 cents to 3 cents lower with may at 633 a bushel

texas air also owns eastern airlines which has been functioning 
under bankruptcy court protection since employees struck in march 
1989

totaling 697 million which it described as litigation settlement 
proceeds special items in the yearago period were 306 million

a trade association of bond dealers has 
announced plans for a joint venture to supply prices 24 hours a 
day responding to a longstanding government request for improved 
distribution of market information 
among those eligible to participate in the joint venture are 44 
primary dealers and seven interbroker dealers said the public 
securities association 
within 60 days of formation the venture could begin to 
disseminate price information said psa general counsel fran 
bermanzohn 
primary dealers buy and sell government bonds and participate in 
treasury auctions interbroker dealers execute trades for 
securities firms but not for the general public 
the move was overwhelmingly approved by the psas primary 
dealers committee last friday at a meeting in white sulphur 
springs va 
the jointventure would negotiate to sell the data to several 
electronic information systems currently brokers get bond quotes 
from financial data services such as telerate inc and reuters 
holdings plc among others 
the government has been pressuring brokers to make price 
information more widely available to the public the general 
accounting office made the recommendation several years ago 
the joint venture is being done in large measure in response 
to a regulatory mandate bermanzohn said many dealers take the 
position that the price information is already out there 
the prices available from the venture would be real time 
quotes which show the last sale price as trades are executed 
between dealers 
the group decided that the best prices would be from the 
industry as a whole as opposed to any group forming together to 
provide a number said thomas pura who chairs the psas 
goverment and federal agency division 
many providers of bond prices have exclusive arrangements with 
interbroker dealers telerate for example has a multiple year 
contract with the cantor fitzgerald brokerage to provide exclusive 
quotes on telerate screens 
the associated press has a similar arrangment with bloomberg 
financial markets which in turn is supplied by merrill lynch 
pura noted that while the price information currently available 
is very good the new system will provide even more information 
will they be significantly different no but people feel 
better having broader access to price information pura said

the federal environmental protection 
agency plans to let automakers keep counting big gasgulping cars 
as imports no matter where the car is assembled epa 
administrator william reilly said monday 
general motors corp and ford motor co have used the provision 
to raise their domestic corporate average fuel economy or cafe by 
changing the manufacturing site of some major components in large 
cars and counting them as part of the companys import fleet 
i dont wish to signal any substantive change in approach on 
cafe at this time reilly said at a news conference before 
addressing the economic club of detroit 
domestic and import fleets are counted separately under cafe 
regulations the amount of domestically made components determines 
if a car is counted in the domestic or import fleet 
for instance ford planned last year to make the 1991 models of 
its ford crown victoria and mercury grand marquis built in st 
thomas ontario count in the companys domestic cafe fleet as 
their domestic content dropped below 75 percent 
such a switch would have made it easier for fords domestic 
fleet to meet cafe regulations by increasing the percentage of more 
fuelefficient cars on its domestic fleet fords imported cars far 
surpassed cafe requirements leaving room for the less 
fuelefficient cars 
ford spokesman dick judy said monday those plans changed and for 
now the cars remain in the domestic cafe column 
the current cafe standard is 275 mpg for both fleets 
reilly was in town for two days of meetings with automotive 
industry executives officials of the united auto workers union and 
epa officials in ann arbor where the agency operates its motor 
vehicle emissions laboratory 
during the news conference and in a speech to the economic club 
reilly pitched the bush administrations clean air proposals and 
praised an oil companys plan to buy for 700 each cars made 
before 1971 when the government began regulating tailpipe emissions 
the faster you replace the older cars with new ones the 
faster youll clean up the air he said however reilly added 
that addition measures are needed to cut tailpipe emissions because 
so many new cars have been added to the highways and cars are being 
driven more 
automakers have balked at further cutting emissions saying that 
it would be very expensive while yielding only minor pollution 
decreases

ames department stores inc which filed 
for federal bankruptcy protection last week on monday replaced its 
chief executive officer with a merchandising veteran likely to trim 
staff and close stores to revive the ailing discounter 
stephen l pistner former chairman at montgomery ward amp co and 
president at daytonhudson corps target discount stores was 
named by the board of directors to replace peter b hollis who 
resigned as ceo and vice chairman 
pistner also will become chairman if his appointment is approved 
by a new york bankruptcy court 
pistner 58 is known as a decisive intelligent businessman who 
pioneered the concept of power departments stores within stores 
that specialize in particular kinds of merchandise like clothing or 
major appliances said howard davidowitz chairman of a new york 
retail consulting firm 
hes a hardnosed businessman and a very wellrespected 
retailer who will probably use an ax rather than a butter knife on 
ames said alan millstein publisher of a monthly newsletter for 
retailers and manufacturers 
its a very courageous act on the part of the board added 
millstein who said the appointment will also assuage creditors and 
suppliers who are nervous about the companys ability to pay its 
bills 
in a brief interview from new york pistner said he would not 
close stores or make other major decisions until he evaluates the 
company he said it would take a good 18 months to put it on more 
solid financial footing 
ames based in rocky hill conn filed for protection from 
creditors last wednesday listing 144 billion in liabilities and 
166 billion in assets it posted a 228 million loss for the 
fiscal year ended jan 27 and owes 14 million to its largest 
creditor 
the nations fourthlargest discounter ames operates more than 
600 stores in 20 states and employs 55000 people it has annual 
sales of more than 4 billion 
experts trace its problems to the 392store zayre chain which 
ames bought in 1988 for 788 million 
some experts said hollis must bear some of the responsibility 
for ames problems because he presided during the zayre acquisition 
it was time to take hollis out of the job because hollis was a 
financial man but didnt understand the merchandising that was 
necessary to attract customers to the stores said walter loeb a 
new yorkbased retail consultant 
davidowitz agreed its very important for creditors because 
the old management simply had no credibility the creditors have 
been hurt very badly and when people are hurt they want a pound of 
flesh and they also want to see new faces 
steve is a known quantity hes been successful in retailing 
for a long time in visible major jobs 
pistner joined daytonhudson in 1970 taking responsibility for 
its target chain in 1973 he was named president and chief 
operating officer of daytonhudson in 1977 
he left in 1971 to become president and chief executive of 
montgomery ward he left montgomery ward in 1985 to become chairman 
of mccrory corp the variety store business owned by 
rapidamerican 
pistner left mccrory in 1988 and has spent the last two years 
pursuing business enterprises including a joint venture in the 
soviet union that he would not disclose

the market isnt expecting much from the scheduled may 2 emergency 
opec meeting 
james steel an analyst at refco inc said the season of peak 
gasoline demand is approaching if the market believed opec could 
bring about a significant supply reduction prices of gasoline 
would have been bid higher he said 
ministers from members of the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries will gather in geneva on wednesday to plot a 
strategy aimed at shoring up world oil prices

opec ministers meet in emergency session wednesday 
in a strategy session to support oil prices which have fallen 
sharply in recent weeks because persian gulf members are believed 
to be violating output quotas 
oil industry analysts speculate the ministers are aiming at 
their meeting in geneva for a voluntary cut of 1 million barrels a 
day in output during may and june 
the quota violators said to be saudi arabia kuwait and the 
united arab emirates would bear the brunt of the cut in current 
production they predicted 
i think the market needs to see something at least like that 
to sustain prices said lucy mullins an analyst with the london 
investment firm barclays de zoete wedd ltd 
such a cut likely would only steady prices because the market 
already has strengthened somewhat on hopes the meeting will produce 
results analysts said whether such cuts will actually take place 
is uncertain 
the actual followthrough in the spot market may be quite 
limited said stephen turner an oil analyst with the london 
investment firm smith new court plc 
north sea brent blend the most widely traded international 
crude oil fetched a spot price of 1645 a barrel in london on 
monday afternoon up 5 cents from friday in the us market the 
benchmark west texas intermediate crude settled at 1854 a 
42gallon barrel monday unchanged from fridays close 
analysts estimate the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries currently is producing about 235 million barrels a day 
exceeding the ceiling of 221 million barrels a day the cartel set 
for the first half of the year 
the 13nation cartel accounts for a substantial portion of the 
world oil market and increasingly influences prices in the united 
states where imports now account for about half the nations 
consumption 
the opec meeting was called april 19 by sadek boussena 
algerias oil minister and cartel president because of concern 
about an unusually sharp price slide that pushed prices down to the 
1516 barrel range vs more than 20 earlier in the year the 
meeting is expected to last one or two days 
the gathering officially is of the eightmember monitoring 
committee which only reviews markets and makes recommendations 
but all ministers are expected to attend which means a full 
emergency conference can be called immediately 
but the ministers arent expected to grapple with their official 
quotas and minimum reference price of 18 a barrel until they hold 
their full regular midyear conference on june 25 
boussena is spearheading intensive contacts among opec members 
to reach consensus on voluntary cuts before wednesday the middle 
east economic survey a nicosiabased oil industry newsletter 
reported monday 
a contentious gathering could have a negative impact on oil 
markets 
the newsletter said the united arab emirates one of the main 
overproducers is regarded as the toughest nut to crack given 
the uaes track record and the easy marketability of its high 
quality crude 
kuwaits oil minister ali khalifah alsabah apparently has 
indicated that kuwait will trim production if other producers do 
so the newsletter said 
saudi arabia would probably have a similar position of 
readiness to contribute to an agreed temporary cutback but not to 
go below its current quota it said 
analysts say the overproduction has created a glut just as 
demand is weakening which usually happens in the spring prior to 
heavy gasoline use during the summer driving season 
this has prompted the unusually sharp price slide and sparked 
fears that prices will collapse as in 1986 when they fell as low 
as 10 a barrel in a glutted market 
analysts believe saudi arabia the worlds leading oil exporter 
is producing about 300000 barrels a day above its daily quota of 
54 million barrels 
the united arab emirates is said to producing an estimated 2 
million barrels a day nearly double its 1095 millionbarrel quota 
kuwait is believed to be producing some 300000 barrels a day 
over its quota of 15 million barrels 
opecs members are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran 
iraq kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia the united arab 
emirates and venezuela

a federal judge extended a court order monday 
barring a manhattan securities brokerage from penny stock sales 
activities that regulators allege are illegal 
us district judge kevin t duffy in new york issued an opinion 
that temporarily bars wellshire securities inc two of its top 
officers and two former employees from further alleged securities 
law violations 
the record is replete with evidence that wellshire employed 
misleading and misrepresentative tactics to defraud its 
investors duffys opinion said in part 
a lawyer for willshire maintained there was no fraudulent 
activity 
duffys decision extended a ban he issued last month in 
response to a securities and exchange commission request which 
accused wellshire of using high pressure and deceptive sales 
practices to induce investors to buy risky overthecounter 
securities 
penny stocks are low cost high risk securities usually issued 
by new or small companies the stocks which sell for as little as 
a few cents are prone to fraud and manipulation because 
information about them is hard for investors to obtain and verify 
in march the sec filed a civil lawsuit alleging that wellshire 
securities operated as a penny stock boiler room from july 1988 
to the present boiler rooms are high pressure sales operations 
that use banks of telephones staffed by sales personnel who use 
questionable tactics to persuade investors to buy risky stocks 
we feel it wasnt a boiler room operation said mitchell 
lampert attorney for wellshire securities my client runs an 
honest business within the confines of the law he feels there was 
no fraudulent activity were unhappy that the opinion is issued 
the sec lawsuit charged that wellshire made exorbitant price 
predictions gave out false information about stocks made 
unauthorized sales and tried to stop clients from selling their 
securities when the price rose 
in one case mentioned in the sec complaint a 68yearold 
retiree was persuaded to borrow money from a home equity loan to 
buy securities 
duffys decision applied to wellshires president robert cohen 
carol martino the firms executive vice president joseph jenkins 
jr a former wellshire broker and alan diamond a former wellshire 
trader 
also barred from further alleged securities law violations was 
ventura inc a needham mass leasing company whose securities 
was one of the penny stocks sold by wellshire

multibillionaire warren buffett took to the 
stage of an ornate renovated theater monday to dispense his 
financial philosophy spiced with comic asides worthy of the 
vaudeville comics who once trod the boards 
more than 900 people crowded into the main floor and balconies 
of the orpheum theater for berkshire hathaway incs annual 
meeting which is more like a downhome gathering of friends than a 
feisty exchange between management and shareholders 
a brief business session preceded two hours of friendly 
questions aimed at chairman buffett and vice chairman charles 
munger 
berkshire hathaway valued at 49 billion is an investment 
concern that has holdings ranging from stock in bigname companies 
like coca cola inc and gillette co to interests in a candy maker 
and an omaha furniture mart 
berkshire hathaways annual meeting is considered noteworthy 
partly because of the enormous respect commanded by buffett who 
cultivated the company from a new england textile mill a 
quartercentury ago into one of the most successful american 
enterprises buffet sometimes is called the oracle of omaha 
his company is also followed closely because its stock is among 
the priciest on monday it traded at 6700 a share on the new 
york stock exchange up 25 from the friday close 
buffett and munger sipped cherry coke and diet coke and munched 
on sees candies as they fielded questions ranging from the 
possibility of a stock split to buffetts philosophy of investing 
in wellmanaged companies that he understands 
problems with microphones as the meeting got under way prompted 
audience laughter as buffett said now you see why we dont 
invest in technology stocks 
buffett briskly concluded the official business of reelecting 
officers with nary a word of dissent or discussion 
with the events of eastern europe this may be the last 
bastion of undiluted authoritarianism left said buffett 59 
buffett said he doubts the companys stock will be split in 
the unforeseeable future 
the company tries to attract a specific type of investor one 
with the same type of longterm investment strategy buffett said 
any way you slice it its the same pie buffett said we 
think better people are sitting down to eat that piece 
when one shareholder asked buffett about his view on the federal 
reserve bank and interest rates buffett turned to munger 
we dont think a lot about macro economics we try to do 
something sound munger said we have no view about interest 
rates we dont know and if we did it probably wouldnt do us any 
good 
asked about the possibility of foreign investments with the 
integration of the european common market in 1992 buffett said 
berkshire has no rule against foreign investing but he said hes 
not enthusiastic about it 
we have a 3 trillion equity market in the united states if 
we cant make money there buffett said 
if he were asked to help change the securities laws buffett 
said he would focus on the tax code which he said presently 
encourages companies to go into debt and influences corporate 
behavior 
people stretched on the edge of debt dont behave very well 
buffett said

michael milken may be entitled to a tax break on 
at least part of 400 million the fallen junk bond king is placing 
in a government fund to compensate injured investors legal experts 
said monday 
such a deduction may appear startling for an admitted felon 
milken pleaded guilty last week to six criminal securities and tax 
law violations but it could be perfectly legal under internal 
revenue service guidelines 
under his settlement of civil and criminal charges the former 
drexel burnham lambert inc executive agreed to pay 200 million in 
fines and 400 million in restitution for investors who can prove 
they were defrauded by his activities 
presuming that milken has reported his income faithfully and 
complied with federal income tax laws and no one says he hasnt 
he already has paid taxes on the 400 million 
milken in effect would be returning money that never belonged to 
him but on which he has paid uncle sam tax experts said 
thats not too shocking said marvin a chirelstein a 
columbia university tax law professor it just reverses the tax 
consequences it puts the situation where its as if it had not 
happened 
according to court papers milken made 11 billion from 1983 to 
1987 his advisers claim he paid nearly onehalf of the amount in 
taxes milkens net worth has been estimated by fortune magazine at 
12 billion 
under the irs tax code civil or criminal defendants are not 
allowed to deduct fines or penalties paid to the government for 
breaking the law milkens 200 million fine to the us treasury 
falls under that provision 
but the code generally allows deductions for the payment of 
compensatory damages as well as fees or expenses incurred in a 
legal defense which can be considered part of normal business 
operations 
however if the government could prove that the money being 
returned was obtained by violating some sharply defined public 
policy that would open the door to preventing a tax deduction 
experts said 
how big a tax break might occur well assuming milken is in the 
highest tax bracket the total could amount to a third of the 
restitution fund about 133 million no one involved in the case 
believes that will happen 
but the public appearance that milken was getting a good deal at 
taxpayers expense might be less than flattering for government 
prosecutors who arranged the plea bargain 
new york tax attorney michael saltzman said the argument against 
a deduction would be its supposed to be part of the punishment 
why would the government be picking up a part of that 
no claims have been made against the money by the irs milken 
doesnt even have to fork over the 400 million until 60 days after 
his scheduled oct 1 sentencing how much actually gets paid out 
might not be resolved for years 
the restitution fund settles allegations by the securities and 
exchange commission that included insider trading and other frauds 
not included in the criminal plea bargain any investor claim is 
eligible for a piece of the fund 
under the terms of the settlement any money not dished out to 
investors after seven years will be turned over to the treasury 
and presumably could then be classified as a fine which would not 
be deductible 
it seems to me in milkens interest to see that as much of 
that gets paid out to those who justifiably lay claim to damage 
said tax attorney lawrence feld chairman of an american bar 
association panel on civil and criminal tax penalties 
an irs spokesman said the law is not clear on what tax 
consequences might arise in cases where restitution is not 
earmarked for a particular individual the spokesman who asked not 
to be named declined to discuss the milken case a spokesman for 
milken also declined to comment 
barry goldsmith sec desputy chief litigation counsel said tax 
deductibility was not a factor in the milken settlement our job 
is to get the money he said

the belzberg family of canada claimed 
monday to have won a seat on the board of armstrong world 
industries inc the company that prompted pennsylvanias tough new 
antitakeover law 
the disclosure came at the armstrongs annual shareholders 
meeting just three days after the state enacted the law designed to 
stymie corporate raiders 
armstrong chairman william h adams said he was confident at 
least three of the four incumbent board members seeking reelection 
were retained 
he acknowledged the possibility that the belzbergs had landed 
one spot on the 13member board but added it would take until at 
least may 11 to get a final vote tally 
the belzbergs own a 107 percent stake in armstrong they have 
waged a proxy fight to seat four directors and change company rules 
to weaken the boards authority to block a hostile takeover 
the state law which took effect immediately is intended to 
discourage corporate raiders by seizing profits from a takeover 
attempt restricting voting rights and preserving labor contracts 
if corporate ownership changes hands 
the law was drafted last year after the belzbergs declared an 
interest in armstrong which makes flooring and building materials 
armstrong management has declined to meet with the belzbergs 
the family has criticized the company for supporting the 
antitakeover law and accused management of working against 
shareholder interests 
armstrong has characterized the belzbergs as inept managers who 
have driven companies virtually into the ground compromising 
shareholder earnings 
addressing the meeting adams said the antitakeover law would 
not alter the companys relationship with stockholders but would 
deter raiders who want to line their own pockets 
adams said the board had adopted a policy ensuring that 
stockholder interests would not be supplanted by other constituents 
the action apparently stems from concerns about the 
antitakeover law which allows management to put the interests of 
employees suppliers or the community above shareholders in making 
corporate decisions including weighing takeover bids 
during the meeting adams was questioned by only one 
stockholder who asked how much the company had spent promoting the 
antitakeover bill adams said he did not have an exact figure but 
that it would be under 500000 
when asked why the directors had not met with the belzbergs he 
said the past operating practices of the belzbergs were not 
encouraging us to meet with them 
the proposed changes to the companys bylaws have been held up 
in a court challenge and were not on the agenda but the company 
took a nonbinding vote to gauge shareholder sentiment the issue 
could be revisited pending the outcome of the suit 
one proposal would allow a shareholder or group owning 20 
percent or more of the stock to call special shareholder meetings 
the company says shareholders can ask the board to call meetings 
at its discretion 
representatives of first city diversified inc a belzberg 
entity said they believed the changes would pass overwhelmingly 
it was not clear when or if the vote would be released 
first citys assertion that it had seated michael c jensen a 
harvard business school professor on the armstrong board was based 
on its owning more than 10 percent of the companys stock in 
addition to proxies it solicited officials said 
other belzberg nominees were richard e bennett chairman of 
scovill inc greta e marshall general partner of the marshall 
plan and a former investment manager for the california public 
employees retirement system and frederick r warrenboulton a 
resident scholar at the american enterprise institute 
the incumbent board members seeking reelection were barbara 
hackman franklin of washington dc joseph l jones of lancaster 
robert f patton of pittsburgh and harry k wells of towson md

a supreme court decision that states and 
individuals have the power to challenge completed mergers on 
anticompetitive grounds isnt likely to arouse a storm of attacks 
on other done deals experts said monday 
enforcement authorities appreciate the business world just 
cant function if transactions can be challenged five and 10 years 
later said georgetown university law professor robert pitofsky 
after the nations highest court said it would allow california 
officials to try to block the merger of the alpha beta and lucky 
grocery store chains 
but the 90 ruling monday nonetheless was expected to inject 
another note of caution into the already wary takeover market 
the supreme court said any opponent of a merger and not just 
the federal government has the right to sue to force the 
divestiture of merged businesses the decision does not negate the 
merger of alpha beta and lucky it sends the case back to court in 
california where state officials must still prove at trial that 
the deal should be blocked 
pitofsky said california sought to block the merger because 
state officials did not get the support they wanted from the 
federal government which had approved the 25 billion acquisition 
of lucky stores inc by alpha betas parent american stores co 
in 1988 
california officials contend that if the companies 600 stores 
in the state are combined consumers would end up paying 440 
million extra each year because of reduced competition and higher 
prices 
despite californias victory lawrence j white a professor at 
the stern graduate school of business at new york university said 
i dont think it is going to mean a grand unlocking of deals 
walter adams an economics professor at michigan state 
university agreed there wouldnt be a flood of litigation to undo 
done deals but he said its possible that some alreadycompleted 
mergers will be challenged on a casebycase basis 
in addition antitrust experts said future deals likely will 
face more scrutiny 
what this does is make the states a major player in mergers 
said pitofsky 
adams said the state attorneys general have been extremely 
active to the extent that they legally could in opposing the merger 
wave and mondays ruling gives local officials more ammunition 
but the decision could have a chilling effect on dealmakers 
themselves forcing them to think twice about proposing a buyout or 
merger that they know could run afoul of state officials 
this in itself may do a great deal to slow down the merger 
movement adams predicted 
adams said a more aggressive stance on antitrust enforcement by 
the bush administration following the more lenient reagan era could 
be behind the supreme courts decision 
the cop on the beat is no longer looking the other way he 
said 
the monday ruling by the high court was likely to further slow 
the takeover business which has been dealt a series of blows over 
the past year on friday for example the pennsylvania legislature 
enacted the toughest antitakeover law in the country 
perhaps more important the collapse of the junk bond market 
last fall has denied takeover investors access to enormous amounts 
of money for acquisitions 
the risky highyield bonds which fueled the takeover boom of 
the 1980s fell out of favor when the 67 billion debtfinanced 
buyout of federated department stores inc faltered in september 
without junk bonds takeover activity has dropped off 
considerably

the supreme court on monday refused to kill a 
lawsuit against general motors corp stemming from what a lower 
court called the highly charged environment of largescale 
layoffs 
the court without comment let stand rulings that the fraud and 
misrepresentation suit by 32 former employees of a gm subsidiary in 
clinton miss should go to trial 
those who sued had been employed at a packard electric plant in 
clinton before gm in 1983 began laying off hundreds of workers 
there in response to sluggish demand for domestic automobiles 
in other action the court 
gave state governments and consumers a potential pocketbook 
victory by ruling unanimously in a california case that they may 
use federal antitrust law to break up corporate mergers 
let the government force thousands of transportation department 
employees to take random drug tests the court without comment 
rejected arguments that such tests violate privacy rights 
requested the bush administrations views about oklahomas 
attempt to collect a sales tax on cigarettes and other items sold 
at a convenience store owned and run by an indian tribe the court 
said it wants to know what justice department lawyers think about a 
ruling that bars the imposition of such a tax 
agreed to settle a bankruptcy dispute stemming from a fraud 
lawsuit against a kansas city mo businessman the court said it 
will hear an appeal by two men who sued the businessman and are 
trying to collect a 525000 judgment the case turns on what 
standard of evidence applies 
cargiant gm negotiated a separation agreement with the 
employees union under which workers could opt for a severance 
payment instead of having their seniority and rehire rights 
preserved 
under the socalled voluntary termination of employment plan 
the 32 packard electric employees received payments of between 
10000 and 22000 when leaving their jobs 
their suit alleges that at meetings to explain the severance 
plan a gm representative said they could be rehired if new jobs 
were created the employees allegedly were told they would have to 
apply like everyone else without any consideration of seniority 
but would be eligible for rehiring 
new positions opened at the plant in 1985 but the 32 
exemployees were told the severance plan they had chosen made them 
ineligible for rehiring 
the 32 employees sued in federal court but based their suit on 
mississippi law claims of fraud and misrepresentation 
lawyers for gm sought a dismissal arguing that the proper forum 
was the national labor relations board even if a court suit were 
allowed gm said the state law claims would be preempted by 
federal labor law 
a federal trial judge and the 5th us circuit court of appeals 
ruled against gm 
the appeals court said the nlrb had no jurisdiction in the case 
it characterized the case as one involving alleged promises made 
and broken in the highly charged environment of largescale layoffs 
and shifts in the labor market 
gm then sought supreme court review 
while the original suit named 32 plaintiffs jackson attorney 
richard roberts iii said it has been expanded to include about 50 
former employees 
were delighted roberts said of the supreme court ruling 
we look forward to proceeding with the lawsuit 
he said a trial date was not immediately scheduled and refused 
to comment on whether he was discussing a settlement with gm 
lawyers 
john maciarz a gm spokesman in detroit were obviously 
disappointed but the case has never been tried on its merits

change in the way manufacturers and others 
stock their inventories helped head off a recession at the 
beginning of the year federal reserve chairman alan greenspan told 
a group purchasing managers monday 
the obvious question is what went wrong with the recession 
forecasts or more exactly what went right with the economy while 
analysts can never be certain of such things there is at least 
presumptive evidence that a major reason perhaps the key reason 
is the marked change in inventory behavior on the part of 
purchasing managers in manufacturing and elsewhere greenspan 
said 
speaking to the 75th annual conference of the national 
association of purchasing management greenspan said changes in the 
inventory cycle are a factor in driving industrial activity in 
the nation 
the economy began to show prerecession symptoms in the second 
quarter of 1989 greenspan said by autumn the signs pointing to a 
recession were more abundant he said 
the weakness in industrial activity bottomed out around the turn 
of the year greenspan said without spreading to other areas of 
the economy 
most if not all past american recessions have been sparked 
or at least aggravated by large inventory swings he said 
modern delivery methods the use of computers to track inventory 
and predict demand and the availability of goods internationally 
have helped prevent the cycle of overstocking and then cutting 
back greenspan said that cycle which in turn forces suppliers to 
adjust their production schedules has not been evident on the 
industrial scene in recent years he said 
greenspan said there will be other reductions of goods that 
affect the business cycle 
the number of cars and trucks owned by households and businesses 
is adequate now he said and sales are likely to reflect primarily 
replacement needs and slower growth in the drivingage population 
in the housing market the low birth rate of the 1960s and 1970s 
means that the building rate in the 1990s will be lower than in the 
1980s greenspan said 
increased interest rates since the first of the year on home 
mortgages and difficulty in obtaining credit by segments of the 
construction industry have also slowed building but the 
difficulties should diminish considerably over time as they 
secure other financing sources he said 
the volume of imports of merchandise excluding oil has 
declined in recent months greenspan said 
overall these indicators point to somewhere between modest 
and moderate growth in factory output over the coming year 
greenspan said

western union co which 
pioneered the telegram on monday announced a plan to restructure 
530 million in debt in an effort to avoid a bankruptcy court 
filing 
under terms of the plan the company would exchange up to 530 
million in principal amount of outstanding debt for new debt 
securities and common stock western union faces a june 15 deadline 
to make a 51 million interest payment 
robert amman western unions president and chief executive 
said in a statement that the plan will remove the financial 
uncertainty clouding our future 
amman said the plan would allow the compant to move forward 
with continued growth of our electronic messaging and financial 
services in markets where western union is the acknowledged 
leader 
the company took special charges of 603 million in the first 
quarter of 1988 in connection with the planned sale of the 
companys microwave voiceswitching facilities 
western union has gotten out of the business of providing 
communications facilities to focus on specialized business and 
consumer services but the company has continued to struggle 
reporting 32 million in losses in 1989 
western union officials told regulators in march that the 
company may have to seek bankruptcy court protection if it cannot 
meet its debt interest payments 
in the filing with the securities and exchange commission 
western union said that without being able to raise additional 
funds it probably would default on the june 15 payment 
this exchange offer would give the company more breathing 
room time to get more focused on operations which is still 
showing losses said al casazza an analyst who follows western 
union for moodys investor service 
but casazza said that even if the plan is accepted theres 
still a great uncertainty over whether theyll ever be successful 
leigh walzer an analyst for rd smith inc said he was more 
optimistic about western unions chances of success if the 
restructuring goes through 
under the plan western union also would reclassify outstanding 
preferred shares the plan must first be approved by bondholders 
if they get this under these terms i would bet they would be 
out of the woods he said 
western union said in a march filing with the sec that if the 
restructuring is not approved the company may seek to raise money 
through a public stock offering or by selling assets

the newly named organization is a notforprofit group of 800

general motors corp said monday it signed a 
threeyear agreement with the national broadcasting co that nbc 
executives called the largest commitment any advertiser has ever 
made for tv commercial time 
the automaker and nbc refused to disclose the value of the deal 
but one executive familiar with it and speaking on condition of 
anonymity said it was for a little less than 700 million 
the agreement involves gm advertising for its cars trucks and 
automotive services on primetime programs on the nbc tv network 
which is the leader in the ratings for that time of the day and on 
its national football league games starting with the 199091 
television season this fall 
it also includes gm advertising on two cable networks in which 
the nbc has an interest the consumer news and business channel 
also known as cnbc and sports channel america nbc is a subsidiary 
of the general electric co 
this purchase is the largest commitment made by any advertiser 
in the history of television advertising sales larry hoffner 
executive vice president for network sales said in a statement 
hoffner said gm will be the exclusive domestic automaker on 
nbcs nfl coverage but said no similar exclusivity was given to gm 
on any nbc primetime shows which include the highlyrated the 
cosby show and cheers 
the previous largest agreement for advertising time on 
television was believed to have involved nbc and american home 
products corp which committed 250 million over several years to 
advertising on the network 
gm spent about 200 million on advertising in all parts of the 
day on the nbc network last year an executive familiar with the 
latest deal said 
this involves something close to where they have been the 
executive said but now they know where they are going to be next 
year and the year after that and that gives them some stability 
according to the trade publication advertising age gm was the 
third biggest national advertising spender in 1988 at nearly 13 
billion and was the biggest network tv advertiser at 443 million 
the company declined to say how much it spends on advertising 
phil guarascio gm executive director of advertising and 
strategic marketing said in a statement that the agreement with 
nbc was consistent with gms ongoing effort to get the maximum 
value for our advertising expenditures to further the sales efforts 
of gm divisions including saturn corp 
the new saturn line of automobiles is expected to go on sale 
this fall other nameplates in the gm stable are chevrolet 
cadillac pontiac oldsmobile buick and gmc 
it assures us attractive prices on the most desirable 
programming while being sifficiently felxible to accommodate 
divisions strategies and allow for midcourse corrections should 
forecast spending plans change guarascio said

ibm stockholders refused to order the company 
monday to halt sales and services to south africa but backers of 
the move nonetheless were claiming a victory in a prolonged battle 
with the leading computer company 
the resolution sponsored by 368 ibm employees and 21 religious 
organizations in europe japan and the united states was approved 
by 17 percent of the 3829 million shares voted during the 
companys annual meeting 
to pass the measure would have needed a simple majority still 
supporters were pleased because the measure only needed 10 percent 
to assure its place on the ballot for the next annual shareholders 
meeting this is the third year the resolutions backers have 
succeeded in winning its reconsideration 
tom belz spokesman for international business machines corp 
aid ibm sold its south african subsidiary ibmsouth africa ltd 
to employees of the subsidiary in 1987 
the new company ism ltd information services management is 
an independent dealership that sells ibm products as well as other 
computer companies products to commercial companies in south 
africa belz said 
jim leas an ibm hardware engineer and sponsor of the 
resolution said the 17 percent vote was the highest vote ever on 
any stockholder resolution in ibm history 
responding to backers during the meeting ibm board chairman 
john f akers said ibm and ism comply with united states export 
regulations and that discontinuation of supplies to ism would be a 
disservice to our former customers and our former employees 
akers also said that while there is nothing in the product 
line that we dont sell to south africa the resale of ibm products 
is controlled by us law 
leas contended ibm has been one of the key supporters of 
apartheid in south africa he argued sale of ibm products and 
services in south africa strengthens the apartheid system and helps 
south africa remain one of the worlds largest arms suppliers 
computers are a strategic import for south africa and ibm has 
sold more computers to south africa than any other country leas 
argued 
belz denied that ibm still does business in south africa 
we dont sell equipment to the south african police the 
military or to apartheidenforcing agencies its the law belz 
said 
the comprehensive antiapartheid act prohibits the sale of 
products to south african apartheidenforcing agencies and to any 
other companies if the product is to be directly used or 
embedded in a weapon system 
about 20 of the resolutions backers staged a fourblock march 
to the assembly hall then chanted and sang hymns outside before 
the meeting began 
in other annual meeting business akers said he expected the 
worlds largest computer company to substantially improve its 
financial performance this year

consumer confidence in the economy fell in april 
because of a deteriorating job outlook erasing an upturn the 
previous month the conference board said 
the businesssponsored research group said monday that its 
consumer confidence index fell in april as consumers were less 
positive about current economic conditions and the outlook for the 
immediate future the index is based on a monthly survey of 5000 
us households 
although the nations unemployment rate has remained unchanged 
for some months at slightly more than 5 percent the number of 
new jobs in march dropped abruptly and sharply said fabian 
linden executive director of the boards consumer research center 
that decline probably contributed to much of the uneasiness 
found by the survey he added 
about 14 percent of respondents to the survey said they expected 
more jobs to become available during the next six months down from 
16 percent in the march survey 
the percentage of respondents who said they felt business 
conditions are good slipped to 23 percent in april from 25 percent 
in march and those saying they expect business conditions to 
improve slipped to 17 percent from 19 percent 
the survey also found a drop in plans by consumers to buy new 
cars and homes in the next six months the board said

coffee filters food wrap and other paper 
products do not contain enough dioxin to warrant regulation and 
pose no significant health concerns the environmental protection 
agency said monday 
nevertheless the epa said it expects the paper industry to 
further reduce dioxin levels in its products and announced new 
regulations to cut dioxin releases into waterways near paper mills 
because of evidence of fish contamination 
the epa said a very small number of individuals whose diets 
rely heavily on fish from waters near such mills may be exposed to 
significant additional cancer risk the agency said it was working 
with states to post fishing advisories near some mills 
a cancer risk analysis from eating fish from waters near 
specific paper mills was still being prepared and no breakdown as 
to health risks by mills was available there are 104 paper mills 
operated by 38 companies that produce bleached paper products 
henry habicht epas deputy administrator said epa planned to 
issue new permit guidelines for states and tougher effluent 
limitations for mills to force industry action the agency also 
said it would curb the use of dioxincontaminated sludge as 
fertilizer near some paper mills 
environmentalists have raised concerns about dioxin in paper 
products since tests several years ago showed traces of the highly 
toxic chemical in bleached wood pulp 
dioxin which is known to cause cancer and birth defects in lab 
animals and in high concetrations skin disorders in humans is a 
byproduct of the chlorinebased bleaching process the epa is under 
a court directive to evaluate the dioxin danger in paper products 
and take protective measures the agency lists it as a probable 
cause of cancer in humans 
the agency said monday that an analysis of cancer risks from 
exposure to bleached paper items shows risks too low to require 
regulatory controls 
the dioxin levels in paper products that come into contact with 
food pose at most an aggregate cancer risk of no greater than 24 
cancers for every 1 million people exposed for such products as 
milk cartons and coffee filters the risks are less than one in 1 
million the epa said 
the agency routinely uses the onein1millionrisk threshold as 
a benchmark for possible regulatory action in cases involving 
cancercausing chemicals in food products 
habicht said the risks for some paper products were somewhat 
greater than one in 1 million but he said no regulatory action is 
needed because contamination levels still were extremely low he 
said the agency intends to press the paper industry to reduce 
those levels even further 
jim benson acting administrator of the food and drug 
administration said the dioxin level in foods from bleached paper 
is not a major health problem but the fda wants the level 
reduced to zero 
red caveny president of the american paper institute said the 
industry has greatly reduced the dioxin levels in paper products 
over the last 18 months by changing the bleaching process he said 
dioxin levels in milk cartons and coffee filters already are so low 
they cannot be distinguished from background dioxin levels 
already found in foods 
we have been able to reduce the levels of dioxins almost 50 
percent in the last two years he said in an interview he 
maintained the improvements have made some of the data used in the 
epa analysis out of date 
epa officials said the greater dioxin concern stems from 
releases of the chemical from mills into waterways 
the agency said tests on fish caught downstream and a few miles 
from some of the mills had dioxin levels great enough to pose as 
much as a onein1000 cancer risk to people eating large amounts 
of such fish habicht said the health concerns are confined to a 
very small number of people whose diet consists of large 
amounts of locally caught fish near some of the mills 
there is no indication of any problem with commercially caught 
fish he said 
in atlanta two activists affiliated with greenpeace climbed 150 
feet up the georgiapacific corp building and unfurled a banner 
reading take the poison out of pulp calling for an end to the 
chlorline bleach process georgiapacific is a major paper 
manufacturer 
beth zoffman a company spokeswoman pointed at the two climbers 
and said this creates a far greater risk than the entire 
production of dioxin in pulp they are creating an unnecessary risk 
to themselves and the people on the ground 
police said the pair would be charged with criminal trespass and 
reckless conduct

the spanishlanguage television network 
telemundo and consumer products giant procter amp gamble are 
launching a halfhour program in which procters products will be 
prominently featured as solutions to a variety of common domestic 
problems the companies said monday 
the show is called hablando and will appear on the telemundo 
network twice a week starting tuesday afternoon 
the telemundo network is one of the nations largest 
spanishlanguage tv networks reaching 36 major markets and an 
estimated 78 percent of the hispanic housholds in the united states 
telemundo productions which is producing the show described 
the program as infotainment or a mixture of education 
information and entertainment 
the show features three actors and guest appearances that 
portray people in a variety of settings including the kitchen and 
the laundry room 
procter amp gamble brands such as luvs diapers scope mouthwash 
and tide laundry detergent are prominently displayed and used 
during various segments of the program in which topics such as 
caring for the baby personal hygiene or cleaning the family wash 
are discussed 
procter amp gamble is also the sole national advertiser on the 
program pitching many of the same products that appear within the 
show in the four minutes of network commercials allowed each half 
hour 
critics of infotainment or infomercials say shows that 
pitch specific products in return for a fee from the manufacturer 
are inappropriate because viewers may mistake them for 
independently produced programs 
but saul p steinberg chairman president and chief executive 
of telemundo group inc defended the arrangement with procter amp 
gamble saying that such associations are common on television in 
spanishspeaking countries 
he said the program provides useful information on local customs 
for people who may have only recently arrived and that it would 
have been a much more expensive undertaking without procter amp 
gambles sponsorship 
viewers will be the judge of the value of the program steinberg 
said saying it will survive for long if its ratings are poor 
nonetheless he added that you can only do so much of this 
and wants a large majority of independent entertainment programming 
on his network 
neil m comber manager of target marketing for cincinnatibased 
procter amp gamble said his company paid a premium of about 5 
percent to 10 percent over the costs of commercials alone for the 
right to have its products used in the program 
he said the company also recently began sponsoring twominute 
informative programs that are being carried on telemundos 
spanishlanguage network rival univision those programs which 
air several times a day on univision are produced in conjunction 
with the spanishlanguage magazine la familia de hoy published by 
whittle communications of knoxville tenn

torchmark inc promised to challenge a 
state regulators order that it halt its proxy fight for control of 
american general corp 
tennessee revenue commissioner joe huddleston said monday that 
torchmark violated state law with its attempt to elect five 
nominees to american generals board of directors on wednesday in 
houston where the insurer is based 
the law says no insurance company or holding company can seek to 
control a tennessee company without prior approval of the state 
department of commerce and insurance 
the change in control statutes are a vital part of the 
regulatory framework that has developed for the protection of 
policyholders interests american general chairman and chief 
executive harold s hook said in houston we are gratified that 
the state of tennessee has acted to order torchmark to comply with 
the law 
torchmark issued a statement promising to go to court to 
challenge the ruling 
huddleston said the proxy action required torchmark to provide 
financial and other detailed information on which the state can 
base its approval or rejection of a takeover american general and 
the state argue that the proxy move by torchmark inc of 
birmingham ala amounts to a takeover which requires approval of 
tennessee 
torchmark contended during a twoday hearing last week that its 
actions do not require it to meet the requirements because a 
successful proxy fight would simply put directors on the board 
willing to discuss a takeover 
torchmark officials also wrote gov ned mcwherter on april 13 to 
advise him among other things that we have no plans to move any 
operations out of tennessee 
tennessee is one of 10 states in which american general is 
considered domiciled because of its operations there regulators in 
texas and new york also have questioned the legality of torchmarks 
proxy solicitation missouri california and virginia have approved 
the process 
torchmark turned to the proxy strategy earlier this month after 
american general turned down its takeover bid of 50 a share in 
cash and 50 worth of torchmark stock

the boeing co which is selling more planes and 
making more on them said monday its sales jumped 60 percent and 
its profits 87 percent in the first quarter of 1990 
company officials said demand should remain high for boeings 
jetliners and hinted strongly they would go ahead with their 
planned new jet the 777 but they warned shareholders at their 
annual meeting to expect another losing year for boeings troubled 
defense and space segments 
boeing announced a threefortwo stock split the second year in 
a row it has done so 
shareholders gave directors permission to issue more stock but 
rejected a request that boeing stop doing business with south 
africa despite efforts by a baptist minister who camped in a 
plywood shack in front of company headquarters for three days and 
urged holders to do the right thing they also turned down 
three shareholders rights resolutions including a call for a 
shareholder vote on the companys poison pill plan 
boeing earned 302 million or 131 a share on sales of 64 
billion for the first three months of 1990 compared with profits 
of 161 million or 70 cents a share on sales of 4 billion in the 
first quarter of 1989 
the 1989 figures are before a restatement to reflect a change in 
accounting for income taxes which produced a onetime gain of 298 
million or 129 a share with the gain earnings in the 1989 
quarter were 459 million or 199 a share 
boeing was left with a number of nearly complete planes when 
production was virtually stopped by a 48day machinists union 
strike last fall as a result it was able to deliver 84 jets in 
the first quarter compared with 67 in firstquarter 1989 
deliveries included 22 747400 jumbo jets boeings largest and 
most expensive plane worth about 125 million each just five 747s 
were delivered in the first quarter of 1989 when boeing was 
struggling to introduce the newmodel 747400 
frank shrontz chairman and chief executive officer said the 
higher profits resulted from increased sales and improved operating 
margins on commercial jets higher federal taxes and losses in 
other segments of the company partially offset that performance he 
said 
last year boeings military and space divisions lost 474 
million boeing has bid aggressively on defense and space contracts 
in recent years and fallen behind on several programs at the 
beginning of the year it consolidated its military work into 
boeing defense and space group to try to make the segments more 
efficient 
shrontz said progress had been made but continuing technical 
cost and schedule problems would result in another operating loss 
in 1990 
boeing didnt release figures on how large the defense loss 
might be but george shapiro analyst with solomon brothers in new 
york said his estimate was about 150 million to 200 million 
boeing is coming to the end of some troublesome programs such 
as the longdelayed new air force one jets and isnt getting any 
new programs that could cause further losses shapiro said 
last week defense secretary dick cheney proposed cutting or 
delaying two key programs for boeing the b2 stealth bomber and 
the advanced tactical fighter boeing is a major subcontractor on 
the b2 with 10000 employees assigned to the project and is 
competing for the multibillion dollar contract for the air forces 
newgeneration warplane 
dan pinick defense and space group president said watershed 
events in the soviet union and eastern europe have led boeing to 
anticipate a 5 percent decline in the defense department budget 
through 1995 
clearly we dont know exactly what the future budget levels 
will be but given the recent events we believe that we should make 
business decisions based on a more conservative estimate pinick 
said 
dean thornton president of boeing commercial airplane group 
got to deliver a much cheerier speech noting that 57 customers 
ordered 963 boeing planes worth 475 billion last year the fifth 
straight year of record orders thornton remarked were getting 
to numbers that i cant hardly relate to 
boeing has cranked up its production rate from 24 planes a month 
in 1988 to 28 in 1989 and plans to be at 34 a month later this 
year thornton said by mid1991 the rate will be 38 month he 
said and boeing is considering going to 41 a month in 1992 
in addition to increasing production on current programs we 
plan to introduce the new 777 airplane in that time frame 
thornton said 
boeing hasnt officially launched the 777 a twoengine widebody 
that would carry 350 passengers but has been talking with airlines 
and firming up its design no airlines have announced orders for it 
yet but shrontz told reporters the company hoped to have reached 
a quantity that would allow us to launch it by midyear 
boeing had a firm backlog of 841 billion in unfilled orders as 
of march 31 compared with 806 billion at the end of 1989 all 
but 8 percent of that was for commercial customers

the chairman of wells fargo bank predicted 
that troubles at the nations banks and thrifts will force a 
radical restructuring and consolidation of the financial services 
industry 
reform radical structural reform is the only sane 
alternative the banker carl reichardt said monday its the 
only safe road 
he predicted that reform eventually would establish a single 
regulatory body to oversee the industry and remove competitive 
barriers between banks securities firms and insurance companies 
reichardt who made his remarks before a gathering of the 
society of american business editors and writers said the 
resolution trust corp established last year to oversee the 
bailout of the thrift industry has a daunting task 
the job will entail giving many sick savings and loans a 
decent burial while trying to preserve as much value as possible 
in selling off what reichardt called a motley collection of 
assets 
complicating the effort are the rtcs byzantine 
organizational chart and the 371page law that governs its work 
reichardt said he called potential buyers bottom fishers who 
are the shrewdest buyers in the country 
he urged banks to improve credit quality and chastised big banks 
for failing to have credit training programs he said that was akin 
to trying to run an engineering company with poets 
as in so many industries the opportunities lie in executing 
the basics well he concluded 
earlier john f mcdonnell chairman of mcdonnell douglas corp 
said booming orders for commercial aircraft and new markets in 
space will help the aerospace industry weather cuts in defense 
spending 
the us defense budget does not represent a vein of gold to 
be mined for social programs mcdonnell conceded 
rather developments in eastern europe and elsewhere represent 
enormous potential for increased commercial aviation as tourism and 
business opportunities grow he said 
defense cuts have renewed enthusiasm for space exploration and 
transportation mcdonnell said adding that prospects in this 
part of our business are looking better than at any time since the 
1960s 
the recent layoff of 3000 workers by the douglas aircraft unit 
in long beach calif was not a retrenchment mcdonnell said 
some workers will be transferred and others were let go because 
they did not have the necessary skills but the overall picture 
remains healthy he said adding that the division hired 10000 
workers last year
