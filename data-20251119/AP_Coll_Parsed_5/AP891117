federal aid was approved friday for 
tornadoravaged huntsville where 17 died and several hundred were 
injured or lost their homes and gov guy hunt toured hospitals and 
visited with grieving families 
ive been around a lot of tornadoes but ive not seen the 
type of damage on as broad a scale as ive seen this morning 
hunt said after a helicopter tour of the 10milelong path of 
destruction 
state emergency management officials estimated the damage in 
excess of 100 million in the agencys letter to president bush 
requesting a disaster declaration said terry abbott the 
governors press secretary 
ive never seen as much rubble from a tornado before said 
danny cooper the state agencys director 
he listed 119 houses destroyed 125 with minor damage and three 
churches two schools 35 businesses and 10 public buildings either 
destroyed or suffering heavy damage 
wind in the tornado was estimated at 250 mph when the twister 
hit wednesday afternoon 
more than 400 people were injured with about 80 still under 
care in hospitals when hunt visited patients rooms friday city 
officials said about 1000 were left homeless 
hunt asked that flags around the state be lowered to halfstaff 
through tuesday in memory of the victims and marilyn quayle wife 
of the vice president planned to visit the battered city saturday 
president bush issued a disaster declaration friday morning to 
clear the way for tornado victims to receive federal relief cooper 
said about 1 million may be needed in the form of individual and 
family grants to provide clothing and temporary housing the 
federal government pays 75 percent of the cost and the state 25 
percent 
grant peterson associate director of the federal emergency 
management agency said friday he hopes that offices can be opened 
sunday to take applications for disaster relief he said assistance 
checks may be in the mail within a week femas reaction time was 
criticized after south carolina was struck by a hurricane 
police spokesman ronnie fudge said several truckloads of food 
had arrived but the city is running out of places to store the 
goods he urged that people donate money to relief agencies rather 
than send food 
hunt visited privately friday morning with families of some of 
the 17 killed in the tornado 
the victims ranged in age from 7 to 67 two of the dead john 
and wanda lewis were found holding each other beneath a table 
crushed by a collapsed ceiling at gates cleaners where lewis was 
manager 
much of westbury mall was reduced to rubble by the tornado 
to look at that building its hard to understand why more 
people were not killed hunt said 
hunt also stopped at a school heavily damaged by the tornado a 
hole in one outside wall exposed a cavedin classroom because the 
tornado struck at 430 pm most of the classrooms were empty and 
only six children were injured 
school personnel and painters in the building were credited with 
helping protect about 30 youngsters in extended hours and 
kindergarten day care programs some children were moved into a 
closet for safety 
there were a lot of heroes or more people would have been 
killed said the governor

the general assembly approved the khmer 
rouge as part of an interim cambodian government thursday but 
western nations split over the role of the brutal regime ousted by 
a vietnamese invasion 11 years ago 
the resolution passed 12417 with 12 abstentions noted 
vietnams announcement that it had withdrawn all its troops from 
cambodia but said the withdrawal was unverified and not part of an 
overall political settlement 
voting against the resolution were vietnam and its main ally 
the soviet union the soviet allies in eastern europe cuba 
nicaragua and afghanistan 
the united states britain france canada and china supported 
the measure but sweden and finland changed their favorable votes 
of last year and abstained to express abhorrence of the khmer 
rouge other abstainers were algeria congo india iraq lebanon 
madagascar mozambique uganda tanzania and north yemen 
in the resolution ending its 11th annual debate on cambodia the 
assembly said a transitional government of all factions should be 
established under prince norodom sihanouk the former cambodian 
ruler who now is a rebel leader and internationally supervised 
elections should follow 
it said there must be no return the universally condemned 
polices and practices of a recent past a clear reference to 
khmer rouge rule 
general assembly resolutions are not binding 
the khmer rouge took over cambodia in april 1975 and killed or 
starved hundreds of thousands of people before the vietnamese 
invasion of december 1978 it now is the strongest of the three 
guerrilla groups fighting the hanoisponsored government 
vietnam reported near the end of september that all its soldiers 
had been withrawn 
swedish delegate lars goranengfelt said in explaining his 
abstention public opinion in sweden and in other democratic 
countries has strongly voiced its revulsion at the prospect of the 
possible return of the khmer rouge that is a healthy reaction 
which my government can not and will not ignore many of the 59 
speakers in the twoday debate denounced the current offensive of 
the khmer rouge who have captured the western provincial capital 
of pailin and are reported advancing on cambodias secondlargest 
city battambang 
last week foreign secretary douglas hurd said britain accepted 
vietnams statement that all its soldiers had withdrawn and said 
his government would send aid to cambodia through private relief 
agencies 
the threefaction resistance alliance led by sihanouk says 
30000 vietnamese soldiers remained behind in cambodian uniforms 
100000 vietnamese militiamen are in cambodia and nearly 1 million 
vietnamese settlers have moved into the country 
western aid has been sent in the past only to cambodian refugee 
camps in thailand some of which are dominated by the khmer rouge 
which has been accused of appropriating the food and clothing for 
its fighting units 
australia announced it will open trade relations with vietnam 
breaking the usled embargo on trade and investment 
the united nations recognizes the resistance alliance as the 
legitimate government of cambodia un officials have drafted 
plans for a peacekeeping force that would help safeguard civil 
rights verify the disarming of factions monitor elections and 
make sure the khmer rouge did not regain power

cbs saturday night with connie chung is set 
this weekend to air another reconstruction of a news story using 
actors to help tell it but at both cbs and nbc the technique 
could prove the wave of the past 
cbs news officials whose lowrated chung series has been hit by 
criticism and even cartoon ridicule for recreating news stories 
with actors may cut back such rerecreations or even drop them 
network sources say 
theyre backpedalling says a cbs executive who spoke on 
condition of anonymity whether they cease to do reenactments or 
do fewer of them and are more selective is a subject of 
discussion 
nbc news which has used news recreations in the first three of 
its yesterday today amp tomorrow specials has also been 
considering whether to end their use on thursday afternoon 
however nbc said a recreation segment would air in a ytt 
broadcast set for nov 28 
tom ross senior vice president for news planning at nbc news 
says the network is satisfied that ytts recreations were accurate 
and handled well but were reevaluating the future of them 
here he says declining to elaborate 
andrew lack executive producer of chungs series did not 
return phone calls cbs spokesman tom goodman declined to comment 
when asked if the shows reenactments are being scaled back or 
eventually will be dropped 
several have been completed though and likely will be 
broadcast one is on the three mile island nuclear plant accident 
in saturdays reenactment an actress plays a teenage girl 
trying to get an abortion two other actors also appear so do 
people who were involved in the real girls real story a spokesman 
for the show says 
this mix of the real and the reenacted recently was lampooned 
in a jules feiffer cartoon it pictured a man watching cbs show 
and hearing that pat sajak plays vice president dan quayle and that 
chung is played by cher 
but the mix is no matter for mirth by news traditionalists like 
former cbs news president richard salant he says reenactments 
blur the line between news and entertainment and wouldnt be 
permitted under guidelines he once drew up for cbs news which he 
left in 1979 
absolutely not he says adding that no news organization 
has anything to go with except its credibility if you start mixing 
imagined fact with real fact there goes your credibility 
both the chung show and nbcs ytt specials say their 
reenactments are clearly identified as such 
but some viewer confusion seems to exist according to a los 
angeles times poll taken in august a month before chungs show 
premiered but after the aug 2 debut of the first of nbcs 
yesterday today amp tomorrow specials 
a majority of the 1250 adults surveyed said they could not 
evaluate the shows but of those who felt they could about 18 
percent considered yesterday today amp tomorrow to be news with 
14 percent thinking it entertainment 
twentysix percent thought abcs primetime live was a news 
program while 18 percent thought it was entertainment that series 
does not use reenactments 
everette dennis executive director of the gannett center for 
media studies says hes not particularly disturbed by the 
reenactments on chungs show and on yesterday today amp 
tomorrow 
if its all right for new york times reporters to say what 
happened at a cabinet meeting they didnt attend he says its 
all right for television to recreate scenes as long as they do 
it with some fidelity to the truth and that theres verifiable 
evidence that the event occurred 
but he denounces simulations such as the controversial one 
in july on abcs world news tonight which purported to 
recreate the transfer to soviet agents of secret documents by 
american diplomat felix s bloch 
bloch has not been charged with anything 
abc has publicly apologized for its july simulation and in a 
recent interview abc news president roone arledge called it an 
aberration 
it was a violation of our policy it never should have 
happened and the people involved have been reprimanded he 
says he calls the simulation that aired the result of a carnival 
of errors that occurred amid lastminute time pressures 
the incident prompted a tightening of abc news guidelines 
covering news simulations or recreations that may be allowed in a 
news program in certain narrowly defined situations 
their use must now be approved first by arledge or his designee 
as well as the broadcasts executive producer 
but abc news he says wont do any series where news 
reenactments are part of the routine 
why not 
i dont really want to get into a big hassle with the other 
people he says but abc news just feels that this is not what 
we want to do 
there is a line between news and entertainment and no matter 
how blurred it becomes on occasions how difficult it is in the 
overall environment of television to maintain we believe there is 
that line and we have our own idea of where that is

people who stopped buying apple juice 
because of the alar chemical scare apparently are buying more 
orange juice according to a national survey 
apple juice sales were down 14 percent to 146 million gallons in 
american supermarkets in the first nine months of 1989 a spokesman 
for ac nielsen co told the florida citrus commission on 
wednesday the drop in revenue was 9 percent to 430 million over 
the same period a year ago 
by contrast supermarket orange juice sales in the same period 
were up 5 percent to 512 million gallons and up 7 percent in value 
to 19 billion said mike miller a nielsen vice president 
alar is the trade name for a spray that keeps apples red and 
fresh longer a widely publicized consumer report in february 
linked alar to a longterm health threat the spray is not used on 
citrus 
apple growers have dropped use of the chemical and federal 
health officials have tried to reassure consumers about the safety 
of apples

a federal judge thursday approved a subpoena 
that would compel former president reagan to produce some of his 
records by next wednesday for the irancontra criminal case of john 
poindexter 
us district court judge harold greene granted a petition by 
lawyers for poindexter who was reagans national security adviser 
in the past the lawyers have said they want portions of reagans 
diaries and notes he took at key meetings with poindexter 
the judge did not say how narrowly or broadly drawn the subpoena 
was 
in a twoparagraph order greene said poindexter may serve 
upon former president reagan and upon the archivist of the united 
states the subpoenas submitted to the court 
the return date for those subpoenas shall be nov 22 1989 
said greene 
the judge ruled last month that poindexter is entitled to 
subpoena specific relevant documents bearing on the criminal 
charges against him 
i have no comment theodore olson a lawyer for the former 
president said in response to greenes order 
reagans lawyers could file a motion to quash the subpoena 
responding to shouted questions as he was entering a limousine 
in cincinnati the former president replied cases like that 
before the law i dont comment 
poindexter who is scheduled to go on trial jan 22 is under 
indictment on two counts of making false statements to congress 
two counts of obstruction of congress and one count of conspiracy 
this is the first time in the irancontra scandal that a judge 
has approved a subpoena for documents from reagan earlier this 
year us district court judge gerhard gesell had quashed a 
subpoena for documents sought from reagan in the case against 
oliver north 
justice department spokesman david runkel said we are in the 
process of reviewing greenes order to determine what action we 
should take if any 
the department will examine the reagan subpoena in light of the 
1974 supreme court ruling on the watergate tapes said a justice 
department source speaking on condition of anonymity 
during the watergate scandal the court ruled that president 
nixon had to comply with a subpoena from the special prosecutor to 
produce tape recordings of 64 conversations the court ruled that 
need for the evidence in a criminal case outweighed the presidents 
rights in the matter 
to date the only information supplied from reagans diary or 
notes in the irancontra affair were portions of the diary shown to 
the staff of independent counsel lawrence walsh walshs staff was 
allowed to see the diary portions and take notes on them after they 
were reviewed by white house legal counsel and deemed to be 
sufficiently relevant to allow investigators to examine them 
poindexter in support of his request said he met daily 
frequently alone with the president during the irancontra affair 
the two men according to poindexter talked of the role of 
richard secord as a middleman in the transfer of arms to iran and 
also discussed the accuracy of a chronology prepared by north and 
reviewed by poindexter 
poindexter now is accused of lying to congress in connection 
with the chronology 
the chronology said that no official in the us government 
learned before january 1986 that hawk missiles had been shipped to 
iran in november 1985 with assistance from the cia 
the shipment overseen by north who kept poindexter apprised of 
its progress occurred without the existence of a presidential 
finding as required by law reagan signed a retroactive finding the 
month after the hawks were transported to iran 
poindexter has made reagan central to his defense by suggesting 
that the president personally authorized the alleged criminal 
activities of which he stands accused 
for example poindexter said that reagan took notes of 
discussions focusing on how to respond to congressional inquiries 
about whether the administration was secretly assisting the contras 
during a congressional ban on the use of appropriations by 
intelliegence agencies to aid the rebels 
we believe the presidents notes will show that he held 
discussions with admiral poindexter first about letters that were 
sent by congress and the appropriateness of any response one of 
poindexters lawyers said in september 
poindexter is accused of obstructing congress by denying that 
the administration was aiding the contras

east germans have won the right to 
travel across borders that once imprisoned them but learning and 
building democracy in their homeland could be a complex task 
now the influence wielded by popular revolt has to be 
transformed into a movement that can make decisions and exercise 
power 
new forum the largest opposition group is only 2 months old 
other movements such as the social democratic party and democracy 
now are even younger 
they are hampered by lack of office space telephones and other 
essentials for building an organization capable of matching the 
powerful apparatus of the communist party 
although demoralized the communists still have tens of 
thousands of powerful positions privileges and a vast media 
network at their disposal 
unlike the social democrats who are attracting middleaged east 
germans hoping to make careers in an organized party new forum 
runs on a theory of grassroots democracy that leaves it 
somewhere between a political movement and a potential party in 
parliament 
that is confusing for people who for 40 years have seen politics 
as a sham in which they have no genuine say they expect new forum 
the only recognizable force in the astounding popular revolt of 
the past month to oust the communist party 
the confusion was evident at a meeting this week of some 120 
members of the central leipzig branch of new forum 
seated in the pews of a city church an audience with an average 
age of about 25 asked questions with restraint and discipline 
rarely seen in western political debates 
should communist party members be allowed to work with new 
forum will new forum contest the promised free elections what is 
the movements program 
the energetic leaders of leipzigs new forum far better 
organized in factories institutes and outlying suburbs than their 
fellow activists in east berlin patiently tried to outline plans 
of course pastor martin kind explained we would attract 
members if we produced a program now but we must take the more 
tiring task of trying to politicize each individual people 
must learn what they dont know yet 
new forum plans to do this by forming basisgruppen or 
basic groups in neighborhoods and workplaces and theme groups 
to tackle issues such as ecology or east germanys strained public 
health system 
each district group will elect people who in turn will nominate 
members of a citywide group that will send members to new forums 
national bodies 
the structure is aimed at making east germans politically aware 
and active 
west germanys greens who sent members to leipzig and berlin 
this week to talk with new forum evolved along similar lines the 
greens wield more influence than pure power and new forum hopes to 
do the same 
fine and good said a woman pensioner but what about 
organization she cycled clear across leipzig last weekend in 
search of a supposed new forum meeting 
other new forum members complained that communists seeking to 
establish credentials as reformers by talking to the opposition 
sometimes announced a dialogue without telling new forum 
new forum the social democrats and others have a tough task to 
keep the revolt peaceful and to build a democracy in a climate in 
which politics is discredited 
but many east germans reckon that now is the best chance they 
will ever have to transform communism into a working democracy 
if we dont succeed this time kind told a western reporter 
during a meeting break then well never make it they can send 
us all to siberia and rule as they please

the soviet union is nearing final passage of 
historic legislation establishing the right to travel but us 
trade barriers will give way only gradually 
commerce secretary robert a mosbacher said thursday the soviet 
travel legislation will not lead to an immediate dismantling of 
tariffs erected by congress 15 years ago in behalf of soviet jews 
he said the soviets at best would get only a yeartoyear 
waiver while restrictions on trade credits would remain in place 
well review it to see if it is sufficient mosbacher said 
of the soviet legislation that is expected to clear its final 
hurdle by december we cant prejudge that 
he did not spell out the us conditions at a joint news 
conference with konstantin f katushev the soviet minister of 
foreign economic affairs but he said the process could take a 
lot longer than his initial guess of one to three months 
besides mosbacher said a new trade agreement with the soviet 
union would have to be negotiated first the last accord was 
nullified by moscow in 1975 in retaliation for the erection of 
tariff barriers to soviet goods a year earlier 
mosbacher and katushev signed commercial agreements designed to 
boost us investment in the soviet union and to launch 
negotiations on a new tax treaty also they set up a working group 
to consider a new trade agreement on a preliminary basis 
mosbacher said 
but he added we want to make clear that we are not beginning 
negotiation of a trade agreement this can come only after the 
soviets codify their emigration legislation and after a waiver 
under the jacksonvanik amendment becomes possible 
the legislation imposed tariffs against soviet goods that are 
not applied to the exports of most other countries the restriction 
on trade credits known as the stevenson amendment was adopted in 
a parallel move by congress 
rep charles e schumer dny who has pushed for wider jewish 
emigration said in a statement the soviet union is making real 
progress but going all the way toward granting mostfavored nation 
mfn status strikes me as premature 
there are several issues that need to be cleaned up there are 
600 longterm refuseniks who should be freed before we extend the 
carrot of mfn 
the national conferece on soviet jewry said meanwhile in a 
statement we welcome the initiative by the soviet government in 
bringing before the supreme soviet a draft law providing for 
freedom of entry and exit 
the conference lists 51336 jews as emigrating from the soviet 
union by the end of october the exodus surpasses the alltime high 
of 51320 reached in 1979 
anticipating us action to facilitate trade soviet ambassador 
yuri v dubinin told reporters at the soviet embassy we are 
expecting some positive steps from the us side he called the 
soviet legislation a breakthrough and evidence of new thinking 
the legislation establishes the right of all soviet citizens to 
travel abroad permanently or on visits and reduces or 
eliminates most restrictions in effect now 
the soviet union measures its words with deeds dubinin said 
as he detailed some of the major provisions and moscows 
expectation of a positive us response 
dubinin linked the legislation which is bound to accelerate an 
already quickening pace of jewish ethnic german armenian and 
pentecostal emigration to president mikhail s gorbachevs effort 
to restructure the soviet economy 
twoway trade now amounts to about 3 billion american grain 
sales to the soviet union account for about 2 billion 
by contrast soviet trade with west germany is nearly 76 
billion a year and with finland a much smaller country 6 billion 
annually 
katushev said american businesses were eager to invest in the 
soviet union and were seeking a favorable approach from the 
bush administration 
we have no prejudices at all to selling to america he said 
through a russian translator we would like to see american women 
in soviet furs

solidarity leader lech walesa sums up his 
philosophy in dealing with the russians in a line there is no 
point in pulling the bear by its moustache 
pausing to let a gentle wave of laughter subside among his 
american listeners he then said with the finesse of a professional 
comedian it is better to tickle him 
his audience a group of experts on the soviet bloc erupted in 
laughter 
walesa whose walrus moustache twinkling eyes and beaklike 
nose are familiar to american audiences showed many faces during 
his triumphant visit to washington this week and in this city of 
politics he cemented his place as one of the premier politicians 
of the 1980s 
asked why he had turned down the offer to become the first 
solidarity prime minister an honor he bestowed on his adviser 
tadeusz mazowiecki walesa acknowledged id like to be prime 
minister that way wherever i went they would play the national 
anthem 
but to have a prime minister who was chairman of a trade 
union that would be worse than communism he said 
when walesa addressed the aflcio convention he was the 
consummate trade union leader he even taped a television 
advertisement for the labor federation closing with the slogan in 
english union yes 
when he spoke to congress he was a polish statesman invoking 
geopolitical imagery that housing secretary jack kemp likened to 
that of winston churchill the fiery orator who led britain during 
world war ii 
those speeches were carefully crafted by walesas team of 
advisers and like all his remarks in washington delivered through 
an interpreter 
but a few times he threw away the text and showed off the cagey 
wit and graphic imagery that enabled him to lead the strike that 
forged solidarity in 1980 steer the banned union through martial 
law and create the first noncommunist government in the soviet 
bloc 
hes a real politician said an admiring zbigniew 
brzezinski who was president carters national security adviser 
he shared the dais with walesa at a conference sponsored by radio 
liberty and radio free europe the usfinanced radio stations 
that have broadcast to the soviet bloc since the depths of the cold 
war 
addressing the experts on eastern europe walesa showed a far 
more relaxed and more nimble persona than while speaking before a 
joint meeting of congress or at the aflcio convention 
walesa a regular radio free europe listener was asked whether 
the station had influenced him 
the degree cannot be measured would there be land and earth 
without the sun he said to a very grateful audience 
walesa who in his darkest days received unswerving support from 
polishborn pope john paul ii not only attended mass every morning 
of his stay in washington he genuflected to the church in his 
public remarks 
asked how he liked dealing with his former adversaries the 
communists walesa responded of course i am a good christian 
as you know therefore i forgive 
and secondly if there were no adversaries i wouldnt exist 
as well ladies and gentlemen if i lived in a normal civilized 
country i would never get a nobel prize so i have gained 
something because of other peoples stupidity he said invoking 
laughter and then applause 
his wit can be acerbic to convey his displeasure at the level 
of aid that canada has offered poland walesa said if things 
keep going at this rate they will give us a beautiful necktie 
but we can only wear it in the coffin 
walesa was asked what he would say to gorbachev if they met 
dzien dobry a friendly polish greeting which is very close 
to the russian phrase for good day he said without missing a 
beat 
id ask him what language we should speak said walesa 
again drawing laughter 
i do have a lot to say to mr gorbachev walesa said 
weaving between gravity and humor such a conference would be 
prepared beforehand by specialists and we would only move our lips 
i do understand the terrible problems that gorbachev has he 
said he is like a juggler who has a hundred balls in the air 
and somehow he is catching all of them said walesa making a 
juggling motion 
fantastic he laughed using the english word 
we shouldnt show off we should solve problems he said 
leaving his audience to guess whether he was praising or 
criticizing the soviet leader a technique walesa perfected in the 
days when a wrong word to could send him to jail

american workplaces reported a sharp rise in 
the number of injuries and illnesses last year particularly 
illnesses attributed to repetitive motion disorders according to 
the labor department 
department and labor union analysts said the reported jump in 
injuries and illnesses from 6 million in 1987 to 64 million last 
year can be at least partly attributed to improved reporting by 
employers 
about 3300 workplace deaths were reported by the departments 
bureau of labor statistics which said it considered that number to 
be very conservative because of the limited scope of its fatality 
data 
margaret seminario the aflcios associate safety director 
said thursday that improved reporting stems from more aggressive 
enforcement of reporting requirements by the labor departments 
occupational safety and health administration 
oshas heavy hand has employers more thoroughly reporting 
data seminario said 
still she said that even considering the impact of improved 
reporting the data still indicated that safety problems in 
american workplaces were getting worse 
the labor department said the reported increases last year 
brought the rate of injuries and illnesses to 86 for every 100 
fulltime workers up from 83 in 1987 the number of incidents 
that resulted in lost work days rose to four for every 100 workers 
in 1988 up from 38 in 1987 
the number of reported injuries and illnesses was up in every 
sector of the economy with more than 200000 of the increase 
coming in manufacturing which reported 246 million onthejob 
injuries and illnesses last year 
the highest incidence of injuries came in automobile 
manufacturing where 195 injuries were reported for every 100 
fulltime workers last year 
of 240000 illnesses reported by employers for 1988 115400 
48 percent were associated with repeated trauma the departments 
term for illnesses blamed on repetitive motion 
the number of reported cases in that category was up 58 percent 
a factor interpreted by analysts as evidence that repetitive motion 
problems are being more clearly identified in manufacturing 
meatpacking construction and other sectors of the economy where 
they are most common

scientists at the national institutes of 
health say they hope laboratory experiments on mice may point the 
way toward development of a longacting contraceptive vaccine for 
women 
the researchers reported thursday that a vaccine developed using 
genetic engineering techniques produces contraception for up to 
nine months in female mice 
the contraceptive vaccine works by preventing fertilization of 
eggs by sperm rather than by interfering with development of the 
fetus after conception or inducing abortions 
findings from the research were published in science the 
journal of the american association for the advancement of science 
asked how long it will be before the work may lead to 
development of a human contraceptive vaccine researcher jurrien 
dean said well in excess of a decade but thats just 
speculation 
in the meantime he said i think that it has potential 
application probably in veterinary medicine and agriculture but 
our main hope as basic scientists is that these studies will 
stimulate investigations into these types of immunologically based 
contraceptive agents 
the researchers focused their attention on the zona pellucida a 
layer of proteins surrounding egg cells produced by the ovaries in 
all female mammals one of the proteins serves as the receptor for 
the male sperm cell when fertilization occurs 
previous studies at nih and elsewhere had shown that if the zona 
pellucida is coated with certain antibodies proteins that produce 
specific immune system reactions injected into test animals then 
sperm cannot fertilize the egg 
in the new research scientists used genetic engineering methods 
to precisely identify the zona pellucidas molecular binding site 
a small protein known as a peptide for a fertilizationblocking 
antibody 
a synthetic version of the bindingsite peptide then was made in 
the laboratory and used to vaccinate female mice after being 
vaccinated with the peptide the mice produced their own antibodies 
serving to prevent fertilization 
this contraceptive effect lasted up to 36 weeks in the mice used 
in the nih experiments 
dean said it was significant that this very precise genetic 
engineering provokes a specific focused antibody response to just 
a small part of the zona protein we believe that this may be 
important in avoiding any side effects such as damage to the ovary 
or to other organs 
identifying the antibody binding site involved cloning the 
particular genes or segments of genetic material which control 
formation of the zona pellucida protein 
it turns out that the zona genes are conserved among 
mammals dean said in an interview that means that very 
similar genes are present in dogs cats cows rats any mammal 
you pick including humans and therefore if we can work out the 
strategy in a model system like mice we might be able to transfer 
those observations to other animals 
the mouse experiments were conducted by a sixmember team led by 
sarah e millar of nihs national institute of diabetes and 
digestive and kidney diseases dean is also affiliated with that 
institute

armed men killed and mutilated 
six jesuit priests their housekeeper and her daughter thursday 
after bursting into their house at a leading university a priest 
quoted witnesses as saying government forces were involved 
the government denied responsibility and condemned the slayings 
as savage and irrational 
president alfredo cristiani told reporters at a news conference 
that he had ordered an investigation the killers will jeopardize 
further the critical situation in our country he said 
the us national council of churches also denounced the 
slayings and the us ambassador said the slayings would have a 
negative impact on cristianis rightist government 
two witnesses said about 30 uniformed police or army soldiers 
entered the campus before dawn and killed the eight with lavish 
barbarity said the rev jose maria tojeira the jesuit order 
leader for central america for example they the troops took 
out their brains 
late thursday uniformed security officers raided a downtown 
office of the lutheran church and arrested 12 foreigners including 
four us citizens who work with the church said michel gagne a 
consular officer in the canadian embassy gagne said the 12 were 
detained by the treasury police but the police would not confirm 
the report 
roman catholic archbishop arturo rivera damas compared the 
killings to the slaying of his predecessor oscar arnulfo romero 
that 1980 assassination marked the beginning of years of killings 
and kidnappings by rightwing death squads 
if this spiral of violence continues death and destruction 
will sweep away many especially those who are of most use to our 
people said rivera damas after leading a prayer over the 
mutilated bodies 
the slayings came on the sixth day of fierce combat around this 
capital following an attack by guerrillas of the leftist farabundo 
marti national liberation front or fmln 
the dead included ignacio ellacuria rector of jose simeon canas 
central american university and vicerector ignacio martinbaro 
the countrys leading expert on polls and polling procedures the 
other dead priests all educators were segundo montes amado 
lopez juan ramon moreno and joaquin lopez lopez 
their housekeeper julia elba ramos and her 15yearold 
daughter celina also were killed said tojeira 
they did not want to leave witnesses said eduardo valdez 
director of jesuit studies at the university 
the educators had received death threats since the heaviest 
fighting of the 10yearold war began saturday and callers to 
radio talk shows had vehemently chastised jesuits as subversives 
and demanded their expulsion or punishment 
the extreme right has for more than a decade accused local 
jesuits and their university of fostering subversive ideology 
rivera damas said those who killed the priests were motivated 
by the same hate that snuffed out the life of monsignor romero 
romero was killed by a sniper while saying mass on march 24 
1980 former president jose napoleon duarte blamed extreme 
rightists for that murder and accused rightist ideologue roberto 
daubuisson of masterminding the assassination 
daubuisson a legislator and honorary president of cristianis 
arena party has been accused of ties to death squads arena 
opponents including the fmln have said frequently that they 
feared a resurgence of death squads since cristiani took over from 
duarte on june 1 
in a communique the governments national information center 
said the crime is intended to destabilize the democratic process 
and increase even more the climate of anguish created by the fmln 
the government and armed forces which denied that troops or 
police were involved said the killings would be investigated 
in washington state department spokesman margaret tutwiler said 
the us ambassador would ask the salvadoran government thursday 
for a full inquiry into this horrendous act 
the ambassador william walker called the slayings a barbaric 
act that has not only brought shame to el salvador but will leave a 
gaping hole in this countrys intellectual and academic community 
walker compared the killings to the dec 2 1980 slayings by 
troops of us maryknoll nuns ita ford and maura clarke ursuline 
sister dorothy kazel and lay worker jean donovan 
it is obviously going to have a negative impact on the 
government of el salvador said walker 
he said he did not know anything about the report that 
government troops were involved 
the united states has supported a succession of governments in 
the civil war against the fmln the fighting has taken more than 
70000 lives and cost 4 billion in military and economic aid this 
decade 
lopez lopez was a native salvadoran ellacuria and the others 
were spaniards who had become naturalized citizens 
valdez said the jesuit slayings occurred about 3 am three 
hours before the end of a dusktodawn curfew on the city he said 
neighbors reported hearing gunshots but thought that it was part 
of the general fighting 
tojeira said the witnesses had been staying in another part of 
the building and hid while the killings took place it was a 
miracle they werent discovered and murdered tojeira said 
he said the terrified witnesses had gone into hiding did not 
want to speak with reporters and did not trust authorities because 
troops were implicated in the killings 
another priest speaking on condition of anonymity said 
soldiers had been posted outside the house since sunday and raided 
and searched it tuesday 
he said the soldiers had demanded to know who slept in each of 
the bedrooms from which the victims were later roused and murdered 
four of the victims had been dragged through the residence and 
deposited in the yard outside trails of blood indicated they had 
been wounded and might still have been alive while being dragged 
in rome the headquarters of the jesuit order condemned this 
barbarous violence that has claimed so many other victims among the 
people of salvador

the senate ethics committee is reviewing 
allegations that sen alfonse m damato rny violated rules in 
the department of housing and urban development scandal a source 
says but there is no indication of a formal investigation 
the ethics panel can check into allegations at an early stage 
before even starting a preliminary inquiry said the source 
speaking thursday on condition of anonymity 
when a complaint is filed one was submitted by the senators 
former opponent the staff begins to look into the allegations 
the ethics committee then must decide whether to proceed to the 
first formal stage a preliminary inquiry 
damatos spokeswoman zenia mucha said in new york we 
havent been told anything about the inquiry which was first 
reported on the cbs evening news 
referring to the cbs report she said that doesnt mean 
squat theyre obligated under the law to investigate anything 
thats filed with the ethics committee 
the new york times said in todays editions the committee had 
decided to hire prominent washington attorney robert s bennett for 
the damato case and for another investigation of the involvement 
of five senators with a failing savings and loan 
bennett earlier this year was selected by the committee to 
investigate accusations that sen david durenberger rminn 
laundered 100000 in campaign contributions through a book 
contract 
last summer mark green who ran against damato in 1986 filed a 
complaint against him with the senate ethics committee saying 
there was substantial evidence that damato broke senate rules 
and federal law green cited news reports of damatos involvement 
in the wedtech scandal and influencepeddling at the department of 
housing and urban development 
damato reportedly has been involved in lobbying hud on behalf 
of projects in new york and puerto rico including winning a 1 
million government grant to build a swimming pool in island park 
ny a middleclass beachfront community the village since has 
decided to kill that project and give back the money 
greens complaint also cited other alleged improprieties going 
back to the early 1970s but damato denounced greens complaint as 
politically motivated 
a figure in the wedtech case testified in court that he made an 
illegal 30000 contribution to damatos reelection campaign but 
the senator denied it 
green who has said in the past that the committee confirmed to 
him receipt of his complaint said thursday night i have gotten 
no official notice from the committee whatsoever

a report by the agriculture department says 
the financial crunch of the early 1980s in which many farmers were 
forced from the land produced fewer lasting problems than were 
predicted at the time 
but the consequences of involuntary exits from farming 
because of financial failure have been varied and are difficult to 
fit into a single pattern according to the departments economic 
research service report 
the consequences of farm loss have been somewhat less negative 
than early press reports although interviews reveal the anguish of 
farm loss the report said many former operators retained all 
or some of their farmland property 
it added nearly all found other jobs most remained in their 
home counties and a sharp rise in disposable family income was 
common however many retained high debt loads and tax liabilities 
from their farm operations 
the usda analysis was based on independent case studies of 
farm exit in all or parts of wisconsin texas north dakota and 
georgia 
research in those areas was conducted or supported by landgrant 
universities along with other state and federal agencies 
sometimes with the financial support of private foundations 
in most cases the studies covered 1981 to 1987 although some 
were for shorter periods within that time frame 
the usda analysis of the research studies noted that the farm 
crisis of the 1980s was forecast to hit mediumsized family farms 
the hardest but the data show considerable variation from one 
study to the next cautioning against simple conclusions about the 
fate of family farms 
further the report said there are serious concerns about the 
financial state of many farmers who have been able to keep 
operating suggesting that the process of going broke is often 
complex and slow 
farmers cut off from further credit did not necessarily cease 
production immediately but continued operating with funds from 
offfarm income shortterm credit from suppliers and personal 
loans the report said some farmers have stayed in operation 
despite nonpayment of debt for five years or more and may face 
foreclosure in the future 
the study showed that between 2 percent and 34 percent of the 
surveyed farmers involuntarily left farming annually during the 
early 1980s 
not counting farmers who died the annualized rate of 
involuntary voluntary and total exits from farming in the surveyed 
areas included 
wisconsin 529 farmers sampled in the eight southwestern 
counties of buffalo crawford la crosse jackson monroe 
richland trempealeau and vernon 198 percent involuntary exit per 
year 326 percent voluntary 524 percent total 
texas 960 sampled 34 percent involuntary exit per year no 
data for voluntary 34 percent total 
north dakota 624 sampled 305 percent involuntary exit per 
year no data for voluntary 305 percent total 
georgia dodge county 281 percent involuntary exit per year 
182 percent voluntary 463 percent total

the agriculture department says the value of 
us dairy livestock and poultry exports in the first half of 1989 
was more than 36 billion up 14 percent from the same six months 
of 1988 
beef pork animal hair live animals leather and poultry meats 
contributed to the increase the departments foreign agricultural 
service said thursday in a report 
animal fats hides and skins were down slightly the report 
said both quantity and value of variety meats were down slightly 
from a year earlier due mostly to a sharp drop in shipments of 
pork variety meats 
in the category of dairy products cheese and nonfat dry milk 
declined 40 percent to 50 percent both in volume and value the 
report said butter exports nearly doubled in volume from a year 
earlier however and were up more than 80 percent in value 
overall the agency said 1989 export value of dairy livestock 
and poultry commodities are expected to rise 9 percent from 
calendar 1988 led by meat and meat products particularly beef and 
pork 
exports of beef and veal during the first six months of this 
year were 178473 metric tons up 85 percent from a year earlier 
the report said the value of those shipments was put at 7307 
million up 64 percent 
the top market was japan 121308 tons valued at 5278 million 
up 71 percent and 56 percent respectively the sales to japan 
accounted for 68 percent of the total beef and veal export volume 
and 72 percent of its value 
other top markets for us beef and veal included canada 
mexico south korea taiwan the bahamas hong kong european

pregnant sheep and goats that nibble on 
certain poisonous weeds risk harming their unborn offspring 
researchers at the agriculture departments poisonous plant 
laboratory in logan utah are using sonograms the same kind of 
machine used to check on human fetuses to prove their point 
the departments agricultural research service said thursday 
that sonograms show that poisons from certain plants eaten by the 
pregnant animals cause deformities in their developing offspring by 
restricting movements in the womb 
kip e panter an agency animal scientist at the logan facility 
said sonograms helped determine for the first time that a fetus 
prevented from moving for three or four days at critical times may 
develop a cleft palate if restricted for 10 to 15 days the 
skeleton will be deformed 
range weeds hazardous to the health of unborn sheep and goats 
include lupine poison hemlock and wild forms of tobacco he said

the energy departments practice of paying all 
fines incurred by private companies that run its nuclear weapons 
plants is undermining efforts to improve environmental conditions 
at the sites federal auditors said today 
in a report to congress the general accounting office said the 
department shields the contractors from all financial liability for 
violations of state and federal environmental laws even the 
companies related legal bills are paid 
by contrast the defense department makes its contractors pay 
such fines the auditors said 
if doe continues its current policy and practice we 
believe doe will reduce contractors incentives to comply with 
hazardous waste regulations and may negate the benefits of the 
environmental protection agencys efforts to enforce its rules at 
these federal facilities the audit report concluded 
rep thomas luken dohio said the report highlighted a serious 
flaw in energy department policy 
doe has disavowed a vital tool for ensuring that its weapons 
plants comply with the environmental laws the basic premise that 
the polluter pays luken said 
luken is chairman of the house energy subcommittee on 
transportation and hazardous materials which was holding a hearing 
today on the gao report and a bill sponsored by rep ron wyden 
dore that would prohibit the government from reimbursing 
contractors if they are at fault for drawing environmental fines or 
penalties 
the departments inspector general earlier this year reported on 
the practice of reimbursing contractors for their fines and the 
department has told congress it is considering changing the 
contracts to limit such reimbursements 
the gao report said the energy departments policy is legally 
permissible and is rooted in the unusual circumstances surrounding 
the origin of the nuclear weapons program the government felt it 
had to offer such financial protection to attract the expertise it 
needed to develop the atomic bomb during world war ii 
todays weapons are made at plants built during and shortly 
after the war the facilities age combined with the governments 
failure to modernize their waste management has led to widespread 
violation of environmental protection regulations 
the report said that since 1983 the epa and various states have 
assessed penalties in six cases against energy department 
contractors for violations of laws governing the handling of 
hazardous wastes four of those cases are unresolved 
in the two other cases settlement agreements were reached in 
which payments totaling 295000 were assessed against the 
contractors the energy department paid the fines in full plus 
528639 in related legal costs of the contractors 
the contractors in these cases were not identified 
in a related development a special team of inspectors said in a 
report released thursday that workers at the y12 nuclear weapons 
plant in oak ridge tenn are not adequately protected from 
exposure to radiation 
among the major flaws in the radiation protection system are a 
failure of the plants health physics specialists to routinely 
check radiation levels in all areas where significant amounts of 
radiation are generated the report said 
in response to the report which was sent to energy secretary 
james d watkins late last month watkins ordered undersecretary 
john tuck to develop a plan to correct the radiation protection 
problems and other safety and environmental flaws identified by the 
team of private and government inspectors

san francisco attorney vaughn r walker whose 
nomination as a federal judge languished for almost two years 
appears headed for confirmation after approval by the senate 
judiciary committee 
after sweeping aside all the mudslinging the committee 
latched onto the truth and overwhelmingly indicated its belief that 
vaughn walker is qualified to serve on the federal bench sen 
pete wilson rcalif said thursday after the panel approved the 
nomination 112 
the nomination goes to the full senate for final action with 
lawmakers scrambling to clear away they last of the nominations 
before a planned prethanksgiving adjournment for the year 
as the committee pushed to wrap up its work it also approved 
and sent to the full senate seven other judicial nominations 
including that of john m walker of new york a cousin of president 
bush 
john walker no relation to vaughn walker is a us district 
judge in new york he has been nominated for a vacancy on the 2nd 
circuit court of appeals 
controversy surrounding vaughn walker concerned his 15year 
membership in the olympic club of san francisco which had no black 
members until last year and still excludes women he resigned feb 
15 but critics said the move came too late and questioned his claim 
to have opposed the exclusion of women 
sen edward m kennedy dmass told the panel the resignation 
and evidence of strenuous opposition to discrimination amounted to 
nothing more than a cynical effort to get himself confirmed he 
was joined by sen paul simon dill in opposing the nomination 
sen alan cranston dcalif asked the committee in february to 
reject walker because of the club issue neither he nor wilson is a 
member of the panel but the wishes of homestate senators in such 
cases often carry weight 
it has been many years however since a homestate senators 
blue slip as lawmakers call it would automatically stop a 
nomination cold 
i havent found enough in the record to cause me to vote 
against his nomination said sen howard m metzenbaum dohio 
he said he had spent more time studying the nomination than any 
other and added that in rejecting a nominee we are indeed 
placing a blot on that individuals record for the rest of his or 
her life 
frankly i think that vaughn walker did far less than he 
should have done or could have done metzenbaum said but he 
added frankly i havent found enough in the record to vote 
against his nomination 
presidential cousin john walker had been opposed for the appeals 
bench by harvard law professor alan dershowitz who said the 
nomination represented a violation of the nations antinepotism 
law but no opponents surfaced on the judiciary committee 
also recommended by the committee were us district court 
nominees edwin l nelson of alabama g thomas van bebber of 
kansas susan webber wright of arkansas edward w nottingham of 
colorado arthur d spatt of new york and edward j lodge of idaho 
the panel approved the nominations as us attorneys of joyce j 
george of ohio jean paul bradshaw of missouri timothy d leonard 
of oklahoma and gene w shepard of iowa it endorsed cindy shinga 
daub of nebraska as a commissioner of the copyright royalty 
tribunal she is the wife of former rep hal daub rneb

democratic congressional leaders are 
postponing sending president bush a child care bill because they 
couldnt resolve a dispute among members of their own party on how 
to provide the new aid 
the child care legislation will be a priority matter early in 
the next session house speaker thomas s foley told reporters 
thursday i am absolutely confident that a historic child care 
bill will be passed sent to the president and signed into law in 
this congress 
house and senate negotiators from the relevant education 
committees reached agreement last week on a version of the bill 
that would have increased direct subsidies through new programs by 
12 billion in fiscal 1990 
in response foley had put the bill on a fast track in the hope 
of getting a compromise package approved by both the house and 
senate and to bushs desk before congress adjourns for the year 
next week 
but reps thomas j downey dny and george miller dcalif 
authors of a competing measure with less money but better able to 
withstand future whims of deficitconscious lawmakers said they 
still intended to press for their own measure if the bill came to a 
floor vote 
instead of establishing new schoolbased programs their bill 
would increase child care subsidies by 200 million in 1990 and 
18 billion over the next five years through an expansion of block 
grant entitlements to states that require no annual appropriations 
no one knows exactly how much of the current block grants are 
devoted to child care but estimates range from 200 million to 
slightly under 1 billion a year 
both house versions and the companion senate package also 
envisioned increasing income tax credits for lowincome families 
with children by 500 to 900 a year

a separate house bill that would give small 
businesses a tax credit to make special accommodations to the 
handicapped will strengthen proposed civil rights legislation for 
the nations 43 million disabled supporters say 
the onetime tax credit of up to 5000 will encourage greater 
compliance by small businesses with the americans with 
disabilities act said rep fred upton rmich who with rep 
kweisi mfume dmd sponsored the tax bill last month 
the two lawmakers said at a news conference thursday that the 
bill already has 155 sponsors 
the bill if passed would address a major objection by the 
national federation of independent business the nations small 
business lobby that the disabilities act gives businesses no 
financial help for the changes they would be forced to make 
the disabilities act would require all businesses to make their 
premises accessible to the handicapped but it exempts them if such 
changes would create an undue hardship the business lobby 
contends that the undue hardship provision though defined in 
the statute will leave businesses at the mercy of an individual 
judges whims 
businesses already are eligible for a 35000 deduction for the 
removal of architectural and transportation barriers but the 
sponsors of the tax bill say that cant help the smaller businesses 
the deduction would be cut to 20000 under the mfumeupton 
bill and the credit would be expanded to include special services 
such as deaf interpreters or equipment modifications 
the onetime credit would be limited to businesses with fewer 
than 15 employees and with annual gross receipts of less than 1 
million 
pending senate legislation would grant the tax credit but 
eliminate the deduction altogether 
ralph g neas executive director of the leadership conference 
on civil rights said the disabilities act already addresses the 
legitimate concerns of small business but would not oppose 
separate tax relief legislation 
we would certainly be willing to discuss ways after the 
enactment of the americans with disabilities act of providing 
incentives for businesses to comply with this historic 
legislation said neas whose coalition represents supporters of 
the bill 
he said the ada will save 300 billion per year in the public 
and private sectors and will provide businesses more qualified 
employees more customers and less taxes

the national archives should have heeded its 
own misgivings about involving the nations largest cigarette 
manufacturer in a campaign to celebrate the bicentennial of the 
bill of rights a house panel chairman says 
by not doing so rep thomas luken said the archives might be 
helping philip morris cos inc make a mockery of the federal 
ban on cigarette advertisements on television and radio 
the ohio democrat revealed at a hearing thursday that the agency 
had expressed its qualms in a letter to the company a year ago 
luken chairs the house subcommittee on transportation and hazardous 
materials which is investigating the arrangement 
the agency had reservations about the appropriateness of 
philip morris role in advertising the bill of rights exhibition 
said susan cooper spokeswoman for the archives in the november 
1988 letter 
however under an august agreement with philip morris the 
archives allowed the company to publish and broadcast promotions of 
the bill of rights 200th anniversary in exchange for a 600000 
donation to the national archives trust fund the materials carry 
the names of both philip morris and the archives 
the agreement has come under fire from antismoking groups and 
members of congress 
the archives and the justice department should pursue whether 
there is a violation or cause for possible prosecution luken 
said 
claudine j weiher deputy archivist told the panel the agency 
questioned the propriety not the legality of the 
advertising campaign 
what we reviewed these segments or ads for was to assure 
ourselves in our own minds that no such advocacy was there said 
weiher 
but an attorney for philip morris argued the nationally 
televised announcement is not restricted 
even those who have tried to find fault with the philip morris 
ads have not to my knowledge asserted that the spots advertise 
cigarettes in the commonly understood sense of the term said 
richard wiley a former chairman of the federal communications 
commission 
the ban extends only to messages that promote the sale or use 
of particular tobacco products added riley 
what our critics object to is not what is being said but who 
is saying it added david i greenberg a philip morris vice 
president 
philip morris cos inc is the holding company for a 
conglomerate that produces a variety of consumer products including 
kraft cheese maxwell house coffee and oscar mayer meats as well as 
marlboro cigarettes 
philip morris is synonymous with cigarettes said luken 
adding the letter showed the archives had similar concerns 
given the first amendment issues relating to smoking he us 
archivist don wilson is concerned that the context in which the 
exhibition would be advertised might lead to a negative public 
response cooper said in the letter dated nov 10 1988 
as a federal government agency we cannot appear to be 
associated with the implicit endorsement of a philosophy behind a 
product she added 
in fact cooper suggested the archives work with another of the 
philip morris corporate entities such as general foods with whom

perestroika could spell profit for american 
businesses whose sympathetic cheering for the reformers in the 
soviet union and eastern europe isnt entirely humanistic 
the tentative moves under soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
to convert to an economy adaptable to western trade and investment 
have sent american lawyers and entrepreneurs to moscow in the 
search for profit 
with the energy of a harriman or rockefeller they will slice 
their way through the red tape and if new emigration legislation 
causes president bush and congress to waive 14yearold tariff 
barriers the current 3 billion a year in twoway trade will 
multiply like fastfood joints on the via venuto and the champs 
delysee 
glory be before too long russians poles east germans and 
hungarians could be gobbling hamburgers and greasy french fries 
like most of the rest of us 
and as konstantin katushev the soviet minister for foreign 
economic relations said in signing a new commercial agreement 
thursday with commerce secretary robert a mosbacher american 
women will be wearing russian furs 
but if the truth be told it is asia where opportunity beckons 
already us trade with the asian countries exceeds trade with 
western europe by a cool 100 billion a year 
japans phenomenal growth is apparent the next car that passes 
yours on the way to thanksgiving dinner at grandmas is likely to 
be japanese and the japanese are buying rockefeller center 
but the prosperity is much broader than that south korea 
taiwan and singapore are all growing by leaps and bounds 
if horace greeley were around today his advice undoubtedly would 
be go east young man 
and east is where the state department has been looking lately 
responding to an invitation from australia secretary of state 
james a baker iii went to canberra last week to proclaim us 
support for a new grouping of 12 nations known as the pacific rim 
they are committed to free trade and to the proposition that it 
will bring with it political democracy 
south korea is the case most frequently cited by administration 
officials as they praise the benefits of free trade market 
economies and unrestrained capitalism 
the soviet union and the eastern bloc may be shifting away from 
traditional marxism but they are not ready to replace karl marx 
with adam smith 
gorbachev warned the west this week not to revel in the failures 
of communism or to try to export capitalism 
there are no such warnings from tokyo or seoul 
the 12 countries including the united states that met in 
canberra are determined to make trade among themselves easier and 
to fan out from their club to the rest of the world 
the strength of japan and the united states has been built on 
a world in which weve been able to trade free prime minister 
bob hawke of australia said afterward 
the initial results were modest the ministers agreed to improve 
communications among the 12 nations and to make smoother 
transportation arrangements for the delivery of goods 
followup meetings were scheduled for singapore and seoul 
i dont know whether i would use the term historic yet 
baker said but i think this has the potential to qualify for 
that type of description 
compared with the riveting events at the berlin wall the 
conference in canberra received scant attention 
but hawke pronounced solemnly there is no doubt that we have 
already moved into the pacific century 
it would be foolhardy to disagree

the bush administrations chances of winning 
quick confirmation of victor stello jr as chief of nuclear weapons 
production appear lost 
energy secretary james d watkins in an unusual personal plea 
to the senate armed services committee said the administration 
wanted stello confirmed before congress starts its twomonth 
recess probably next week 
but thursday after two days of hearings on stellos fitness for 
the post the committee acknowledged it was unsure how and when to 
act on the nomination 
sen sam nunn dga the panel chairman said the 20member 
committee would meet in closed session this afternoon to consider 
its next step he said one option was to bring stello back to 
supplement the testimony he delivered wednesday 
watkins told the committee wednesday that he urgently needed a 
confirmed assistant secretary for defense programs to carry out the 
reforms needed to get the weapons production complex in full 
operation again key elements of the complex have been shut down in 
recent months for safety reasons 
stello the chief of staff of the nuclear regulatory commission 
is accused by opponents of being lax on nuclear safety matters he 
has stoutly denied that and contended hes fully qualified for the 
weapons post 
mr stello should not be in this kind of position of 
responsibility rep peter kostmayer dpa told nunns 
committee thursday kostmayer is chairman of a house interior 
investigations subcommittee that held hearings earlier this year on 
stellos nrc activities 
at least two committee members democratic sens timothy wirth 
of colorado and edward kennedy of massachusetts oppose the 
nomination and sen john glenn dohio has strongly hinted that 
he believes stello is illsuited for the post 
wirth took the lead during the first two days of hearings in 
seeking to draw out details of numerous allegations of professional 
misconduct and poor judgment by stello during his tenure at the 
nuclear regulatory commission which regulates commercial nuclear 
power 
wirths questioning of opposition witnesses thursday prompted 
sen john mccain rariz to accuse the panels democratic 
majority of using stalling tactics to scuttle the nomination 
this is becoming hauntingly familiar to me mccain said 
later referring directly to the committees lengthy confirmation 
hearing on john tower as president bushs nominee for defense 
secretary the panel voted not to recommend towers confirmation 
and he was rejected by the senate in march 
i am very sorry to see it happen again to a candidate of 
proven qualifications mccain said adding that he believed it 
was pretty predictable that the committee would not vote 
favorably on stellos nomination 
mccain left the hearing and did not return 
two former chairmen of the nrc during stellos tenure at the 
agency lando zech jr and marcus rowden praised stello and urged 
his nomination be confirmed 
i know him as a man of honor integrity competence said 
zech who retired in july after three years as nrc chairman adm 
watkins is absolutely correct in the choice he has made 
robert pollard a former nrc staffer who worked under stello in 
the 1970s said he had no doubts about stellos personal character 
but that his record as a nuclear regulator showed he was willing to 
put production goals ahead of safety concerns

president bush will veto a twoyear bill 
authorizing operations of the state department because it contains 
restrictions that would tie the presidents hands in foreign 
policy his top advisers say 
the constitutional conflict was created when the senate approved 
the 97 billion measure thursday and sent it to the white house 
after weeks of talks aimed at finding a compromise broke down 
a veto would scuttle not only the authorization for most us 
diplomatic activities but also a series of trade sanctions against 
china in response to last summers brutal crackdown on 
prodemocracy demonstrators 
in a legal provision arising from the irancontra scandal the 
bill would bar the president from using us aid money to entice 
foreign governments to carry out policies that are contrary to 
american law 
in a letter to sen jesse helms rnc national security 
adviser brent scowcroft and lawrence eagleburger deputy secretary 
of state said the new congressional restrictions would severely 
hamper the conduct of us foreign policy and would impose an 
unfair and unreasonable burden on our diplomats and on the conduct 
of our diplomacy and intelligence activities 
the confrontation left bruised feelings among white house allies 
on capitol hill and anger at white house counsel c boyden gray 
to say that this will be vetoed comes very close to saying the 
presidency is above the law said sen daniel patrick moynihan 
dny who sponsored the provision 
moynihan said the white house is being controlled on the issue 
by a group of young lawyers who are arguing the president has 
the prerogative to set foreign policy but who are ignoring that 
the constitution provides for shared powers 
it became apparent to me that the lawyers at the white house 
got their noses involved in substance and not law said sen 
warren rudman rnh who had sought to work out a compromise i 
frankly think its left some scars that are very deep with people 
up here 
the bill would prohibit use of us aid money to leverage 
policy moves by a foreign country that the united states would be 
unable to carry out itself because of legal restrictions 
it is aimed at situations like one several years ago in which 
aid money was expedited to honduras in exchange for that countrys 
harboring of the usbacked nicaraguan contra rebels at a time 
when congress barred direct or indirect us military support for 
the rebels 
moynihans initiative would provide for criminal penalties for 
violators but made clear that the president would not be barred 
from expressing his views to any party on any subject 
the same fight may well be waged on another front as well a 
similar provision only without the criminal penalties has been 
made part of the 1990 foreign aid spending bill 
the china sanctions include suspension of risk insurance for 
companies doing business in china suspension of trade assistance 
a freeze on exports of us satellites a halt to sales of 
controlled munitions and an end to sale of certain nuclear 
materials and components

gary coopers daughter maria cooper janis says 
her father started out wanting to be an artist while painter pablo 
picasso fancied himself a hand with a sixshooter 
cooper hero of many a horse opera in his 98movie acting 
career was always sketching and was frustrated that he never had 
the time to make good paintings maria cooper janis wrote in a 
remembrance of her father in next weeks parade magazine 
picasso and his wife jacqueline were friends of my parents 
and we often visited them in the south of france she said 
on one visit poppa presented the painter with a sixshooter 
and the white stetson he had worn in saratoga trunk picasso was 
thrilled and the two of them spent the afternoon firing at beer 
cans they set up as targets 
picasso was far more accurate with a brush than with a gun it 
turned out but poppa in his gentlemanly way deliberately missed 
shot after shot and the two men had a grand old time

the south african government says it has no 
connection with an alleged conspiracy to illegally ship missile 
guidance equipment worth 50 million to its stateowned arms 
company 
three south african businessmen and two americans were indicted 
thursday as part of a us customs service sting operation aimed at 
stemming the illegal export of hightechnology items and military 
hardware 
the five were accused of plotting to ship gyroscopes 
manufactured by northrop corp through israel to armscor the south 
african national arms company 
armscor which stands for the armaments development and 
production corp makes more than 95 percent of the south african 
militarys weapons and sells to 32 countries 
at a news conference us attorney jay stephens said the 
inference to be drawn is that armscor either requested the 
defendants to get the gyroscopes or that the arms brokers knew 
armscor would be an interested purchaser 
however patrick evans a spokesman at the south african embassy 
in washington said his country was well aware of the us laws 
and regulations particularly in the field of the arms boycott 
and would do nothing to circumvent them 
the natural extension of that statement is that there is no 
one in south africa or its agencies who is involved in this 
matter evans said 
stephens said the investigation was over 
congress to encourage an end to apartheid in 1986 prohibited 
the export of a wide array of military items to south africa 
the conspirators had supplied material to the south africans in 
the past and the south african government is going to have a lot 
of business flowing our way one of the conspirators frank j 
randazzo 32 of virginia told the undercover agents according to 
an affidavit by a customs agent 
one of the south africans charged symone morris behrmann 32 
said that israel aircraft industries a stateowned concern would 
help obtain the gyroscopes for a price that would be very high 
according to the affidavit 
behrmann reportedly met with the owner of iai in israel the 
affidavit added 
the affidavit said the israeli company contacted northrop in 
1988 and made a request for gyroscopes that is nearly identical 
to those sought by the five people charged 
in addition to conspiracy the five were indicted on charges of 
violating the arms export control act and the antiapartheid act 
in addition to randazzo and behrmann those charged by a federal 
grand jury were guy perfezou a south african resident and his 
company perfezou imports amp exports ltd of maraisburg in south 
africa lester george buckingham talbot a south african resident 
and maryanne e callaghan of warwick ri behrmann lives in 
toronto behrmann perfezou and randazzo also were accused of money 
laundering 
behrmann callaghan and randazzo have been arrested

a 436 billion agriculture department 
spending bill is on its way to the presidents desk for his 
expected signature to start money flowing to finance scores of food 
and farm programs for fiscal 1990 
the department has been operating under temporary measures that 
have kept spending at 1989 levels while congress settled 
differences on programs for the fiscal year that began oct 1 
both the house and senate gave speedy final approval by voice 
vote thursday to the bill which provides money for agricultural 
research conservation price supports marketing and inspection 
domestic nutrition and export and international activities 
the measure had been hung up in conference committee for weeks 
because of a dispute between sen dale bumpers dark and rep 
jamie whitten dmiss over a 11 million hotline program for 
farmers 
bumpers wanted to preserve the hotline which informs farmers 
how to reduce pesticides and herbicides against the wishes of 
whitten chairman of the house appropriations committee 
bumpers finally agreed to stop his effort saying he will try to 
shift the program to the interior department 
the standoff between bumpers and whitten had delayed the finish 
of negotiations on a compromise reconciling differences between 
house and senate versions of the spending bill 
it took less time for the pilgrims to sail to the new world 
than for this conference report to return to the house said rep 
silvio conte of massachusetts ranking republican on the 
appropriations committee 
the house approved its original version of the bill 10 weeks ago 
half the bill is for food and consumer programs whitten 
said adding that there are increases for water and sewer needs in 
the rural development section of the bill funds for conservation 
programs were held at last years level 
the measure finances cooperative research extension service 
marketing and export enhancements also were kept at last years 
levels but total spending is about 3 billion less than last year 
major reductions came from lower spending for farm income 
protection and price support operations said rep virginia smith 
rneb 
she said 113 billion would be spent on farm program payments 
which is more than 2 billion lower than 1989 spending projections 
more than half of the money will be used to benefit the entire 
public not just agriculture she said these programs include 
school lunch programs nutrition assistance for the poor and 
elderly international trade programs food and drug safety

investigators are visiting homes in new mexico 
and chemical manufacturers in japan as part of a wideranging 
effort to explain reports of an unusual blood disorder in 35 states 
a major question is what role if any is being played by a 
nutritional supplement called ltryptophan 
so far 243 possible cases of the blood disease have been 
reported from the 35 states and the district of columbia said 
edwin kilbourne of the federal centers for disease control 
one woman in minnesota has died from the disorder state 
epidemiologist michael osterholm said 
in new mexico only 15 of 30 reported possible cases turned out 
to be confirmed a spokesman for state health authorities said 
thursday 
investigators are calling the disorder eosinophiliamyalgia 
syndrome and say it is not clear whether it is a new condition it 
includes an abnormally high number of white blood cells called 
eosinophils plus severe muscle pain called myalgia 
its cause has not been determined but since many patients 
report having taken ltryptophan supplements the food and drug 
administration has advised consumers to stop taking the tablets or 
capsules temporarily 
rep bill richardson dnm introduced a bill in congress on 
thursday to extend a new mexico ban on ltryptophan supplements 
nationwide 
preliminary studies indicate there is an association between 
eosinophiliamyalgia syndrome and ltryptophan he said if the 
food and drug administration wont ban this product and protect the 
american public then congress ought to 
doses of ltryptophan are used by some people for insomnia 
depression premenstrual syndrome or appetite control the 
supplements have been sold in a variety of stores but on tuesday a 
food industry group asked retailers distributors and wholesalers 
to suspend sales temporarily 
ltryptophan is a building block of protein in a wide variety of 
foods a normal diet includes about 04 ounce of it a day said 
richard wurtman of the massachusetts institute of technology 
the body needs it to produce proteins and a substance called 
serotonin that helps brain cells communicate he said 
among the mysteries investigators face are whether the 
supplements have anything to do with the syndrome and if so 
whether the problem is the ltryptophan itself or some contaminant 
the syndrome is being investigated in all 50 states kilbourne 
said 
in new mexico for example researchers are combing laboratory 
and medical records for potential cases of the disorder and then 
interviewing the affected people 
in the halfhour interviews investigators ask about more than 
30 possible causes including use of raw meats and fish and various 
medications as well as ltryptophan said millicent eidson 
environmental epidemiologist at the state health and environment 
department 
then investigators go to neighbors seeking somebody of the same 
sex and age as the affected person to ask the same questions the 
idea is to see if any possible cause pops up much more often among 
the affected people than unaffected ones 
such a study recently found that all 10 affected people studied 
had taken ltryptophan supplements while only two of 20 healthy 
people had used them the odds of that happening simply by chance 
were only five in 100000 eidson said 
meanwhile the fda is following up on the fact that most 
ltryptophan used in supplements sold in the united states appears 
to come from four or fewer japanese manufacturers said douglas 
archer director of the microbiology division at the fdas center 
for food safety and applied nutrition 
fda representatives who happened to be in japan are inspecting 
the suppliers there he said 
fda has also sent cables to those companies to ask for such 
information as manufacturing processes sources of raw materials 
and how the substance is purified he said 
in washington fda researchers are analyzing ltryptophan 
capsules obtained from people with the syndrome as well as samples 
from manufacturers more than 65 brands are included 
one task is to look for contaminants which is difficult because 
investigators do not know what kind of substance to seek archer 
said 
jb cordaro president of a food industry group called the 
council for responsible nutrition said industry and federal 
studies have not turned up any evidence of contamination

book of world records as the oldest living person on earth 
as many as 800 guests are expected at the party planned for 
monday at putnam memorial nursing home where mrs white lives and 
there will be a big cake nursing home adminstrator paul allen said 
when she turned 114 guinness representatives gave mrs white a 
gold embossed certificate declaring her the oldest person alive 
though she was not listed as such in the 1989 edition of the record 
book because hospital records certifying her age had not been 
authenticated in time 
most of mrs whites life is a sad mystery she spent 75 years 
in a mental institution 
she was born carrie joyner on nov 18 1874 in gadsden county 
near georgia she lived and worked near tallahassee and married 
john white who was a blacksmith or farmer 
in 1909 her husband admitted her to the florida state hospital 
at chattahoochee hospital records described mrs whites problem 
as posttyphoid psychosis but doctors today dont recognize 
the term 
mrs white wasnt released until 1984 and when asked now she 
either cant or wont talk about her past said marjorie allen her 
guardian 
the wall would just go up mrs allen said and mrs white 
would become silent i know that she can think back i can see 
the expressions i can see the bitterness so i do not delve any 
more with carrie 
whats the point of that what im concerned about is carrie 
now that she has a happy life

senate and house negotiators are trying to get 
a derailed 938 million threeyear aid plan for poland and hungary 
back on track before solidarity leader lech walesa ends his us 
visit 
the bill authorizing the aid funds hit a sudden snag thursday 
night after republican senators complained that most of the 
safeguards they had added to the measure to prevent misuse of the 
money had been removed by democratic staff members 
one such amendment would terminate the program if the aid were 
converted into military assistance to nicaragua or cuba 
after hours of consultations senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine halted senate consideration of the measure 
reinstituted the chambers original bill with the gop amendments 
intact and sent it to a formal conference with negotiators from 
both chambers 
although mitchell called for speedy action the development will 
delay final passage of the aid measure that walesa has said will 
give his country a badly needed boost as it attempts to build 
democratic institutions and moves to a freemarket economy walesa 
leaves the united states on monday 
the senate impasse developed hours after the house approved a 
version of the measure authorizing 84654 million for poland and 
915 million for hungary 
the house added a 200 million standby trade credit insurance 
program for poland a provision not included in the senatepassed 
bill 
but when the measure was sent back to the senate for approval 
sen jesse helms rnc the ranking gop member of the senate 
appropriations committee angrily objected 
this measure was mutilated by democratic staff members 
helms complained 
staff members of the majority party were allowed to rip apart 
this bill they hijacked this bill on the way to the house many of 
the most worthy provisions have been eliminated 
earlier the house voted 37247 to approve the measure 
as approved by the house the bill authorizes 200 million to 
help poland shore up the value of its currency which has been 
battered by inflation and creates a 240 million private enterprise 
fund to bolster freemarket reforms

in a case that has attracted international 
attention cubas bestknown human rights activist and two allies 
were going on trial today in havana on charges of spreading false 
news about the government 
elizardo sanchez president of the cuban commission on human 
rights and national reconciliation faces a jail term of up to four 
years for what the government regards as slanderous information he 
gave to american reporters last summer 
private human rights organizations say the aug 6 arrest of 
sanchez is part of a broader deterioration in rights protection in 
cuba 
the government had been giving activists such a sanchez greater 
leeway over the preceding two years allowing him to meet without 
interference with american and other foreign journalists 
the other defendants in the trial at havana provincial court are 
hiran abi cobas and hubert jerez who also have been active in the 
rights movement the trial has been postponed several times because 
abi was ill 
at least two foreign human rights organization asked for 
permission to monitor the trial but were turned down by cuban 
authorities 
sanchezs troubles began in june when he publicly criticized the 
governments handling of disgraced military hero gen arnaldo 
ochoa who was convicted on drug and corruption charges and was 
executed the next month 
sanchez once suggested to an american television reporter that 
ochoa had not been mentally alert during his trial because he had 
been given a drug or sedative he found fault with other aspects of 
ochoas treatment and once the death sentence had been carried 
out he said this was a public assassination carried out in 
judicial clothes 
congressional staff members and other americans who have 
traveled to havana to plead for leniency for sanchez were told that 
his remarks constituted an attack on the integrity of the 
revolution and on president fidel castro 
the cuban officials told the visitors that suggestions of legal 
improprieties could lead some to conclude that castro had been 
overlooking the activities of ochoa a onetime trusted lieutenant 
thus exposing castro to charges of complicity 
one subplot to the case is that sanchez has been viewed with 
suspicion by the more conservative members of the cuban exile 
community who disagree with his philosophy of national 
reconciliation because it implies acceptance of continued rule by 
castro 
some critics had even accused him of being a government agent 
those accusations have been muted since sanchezs arrest he 
said in a letter smuggled out of cuba that he was subjected to 
severe hardship during his first five weeks of confinement 
he recently spent several days at a psychiatric hospital where 
some political prisoners say they have been subjected to abusive 
treatment sanchez is reported to have been treated well 
in 1986 sanchez a former philosophy professor was detained 
for eight months for talking to two foreign reporters it was after 
his release that the cuban government began to show more tolerance 
for activists such as sanchez 
working out of his garage sanchez kept copious records of the 
victims of perceived rights abuses in july shortly before his 
arrest he confided to foreign reporters that he felt he might soon 
lose his freedom 
almost 30 cubans who had spoken to the un commission on human 
rights in september 1988 had been detained and there was no sign 
that castro was intent on imitating some east european countries by 
permitting greater individual freedom 
recently 30 members of congress sent a letter to castro calling 
sanchez and his two colleagues cuban patriots and demanding 
their immediate release 
americas watch a new yorkbased human rights group said in a 
statement this week that cuba has become increasingly 
intolerant on rights questions 
wayne smith a former us diplomat who advocates better 
relations with cuba said after making an appeal on sanchezs

more than half of the criminal suspects in many 
of the nations big cities had used cocaine within a few days of 
their arrests a federal study shows 
the study indicated that threequarters of the criminals in new 
york and philadelphia and 65 percent of those in washington dc 
use cocaine 
one official said it showed that the real drug problem is in 
the nations criminal sector 
we could find the large bulk of drug users by looking at the 
13 million arrests made each year said eric wish of the national 
institute of justice an arm of the justice department that 
conducted the survey 
the centers for disease control released the study thursday 
since 1986 the institute has monitored drugs in selected cities 
with tests that detect cocaine use within the previous two to three 
days wish said those surveyed included people arrested for most 
crimes except traffic violations and vagrancy 
in testing in 14 cities last january february and march four 
other cities reported cocaine use by half or more of the arrested 
men new orleans 59 percent cleveland 56 percent detroit 54 
percent and dallas 50 percent 
the prevalence of recent cocaine use among arrestees is 
striking the cdc said noting that the percentage of arrested 
men who used cocaine in new orleans had doubled from 1987 to 1989 
the overwhelming conclusion from all these data is that most 
dysfunctional drug use the primary demand is coming from the 
criminal population wish said 
the amount of drug use among criminals varied however with 
only 24 percent of those detained in san antonio testing positive 
for cocaine 
other cities where tests were done included st louis 47 
percent kansas city 44 percent san diego 42 percent portland 
36 percent phoenix about 30 percent and indianapolis 26 percent 
fewer than 25 percent of those tested in the survey were 
arrested for drug crimes officials said 
the survey indicated that fewer criminals use marijuana than 
cocaine marijuana use ranged from 44 percent of those tested in 
san diego to 13 percent in new york and washington 
the survey also tested for opiates and amphetamines all cities 
reported less than 20 percent for each except san diego which 
reported 35 percent using amphetamines 
researchers also asked arrested men about their drug habits 
between 38 percent in san diego and 15 percent in dallas 
reported that they had used injectible drugs at some time 
in 11 cities more than 20 percent of those using injectible 
drugs said they were sharing needles with other users 
that according to the cdc indicates that a substantial 
proportion of the arrestees engage in behaviors that put them at 
increased risk for transmission of hiv the virus which causes 
aids

housepassed legislation aims at strengthening 
congressional ethics rules but also would repeal a tough new law 
to prevent abuses in federal contract procurement 
rep john conyers dmich chairman of the house government 
operations committee criticized the deletion thursday and 
described it as the bush administrations price for supporting the 
payethics package 
house members voted 252174 thursday to raise their pay by more 
than 30000 a year over the next 13 months to above 120000 
annually while eliminating acceptance of honoraria and limiting 
other outside income federal judges and top executive branch 
officials also would get higher pay 
the procurement law which took effect in july was largely a 
response to a defense department procurement scandal involving 
payoffs and leaks of inside information to contractors and 
consultants 
the procurement legislation prohibits contractors from offering 
gratuities to federal employees and makes it illegal for government 
officials to solicit or accept gifts 
the law also prohibits the disclosure of sensitive information 
and establishes a twoyear period after government employment 
during which procurement officials are barred from working on the 
contracts they handled 
now in the middle of the night the president has exacted the 
repeal of this provision as the price for muchneeded pay reform 
conyers said we have given the procurement process back to those 
companies that have brought us operation ill wind the name given 
to the pentagon investigation and similar scandals 
the reforms passed by the house includes provisions to curb 
excessive free travel food and lodging on trips sponsored by 
special interest groups 
the principal issue is the public perception that such 
trips often may amount to paid vacations for the member and his 
family the bipartisan house ethics task force that wrote the 
reforms said in a report thursday 
the house package would end acceptance of honoraria in 1991 
except when the money is given to charity but congressional 
watchdogs have long recognized that fully paid trips to a 
conference at hilton head island sc can be worth more than the 
2000 per speech a lawmaker could earn addressing the gathering 
the package would prohibit acceptance of travel lodging and 
food expenses for more than four consecutive days for trips in the 
continental united states and seven consecutive days excluding 
travel days for foreign travel 
the language would allow the house ethics committee to grant 
waivers and permit the member to accept expenses for one relative 
there currently are no time limits on such trips 
the ethics package has a broad range of other provisions 
including a limit on earned outside income of 15 percent of salary 
starting in 1991 and a prohibition on receipt of gifts from 
nonfamily members of more than 200 a year beginning jan 1 1990 
the house ethics committee formally the committee on standards 
of official conduct would divide into separate subcommittees to 
investigate a case and conduct a trial phase in 1993 the package 
would end a perk that allows house members who were in office in 
1980 to keep leftover campaign money when they retire new 
categories of financial disclosure would be established 
these reforms come with strings attached because congress would 
receive annual automatic costofliving increases based on an 
economic index also none of the reforms would take effect unless 
the full pay raise voted thursday actually goes into effect 
congress could if it chooses repeal some or all of the raise 
next year the bulk of the increase doesnt become effective until 
jan 1 1991

betterthanexpected improvement in the us trade deficit in 
september 
the us commerce department reported thursday that the nations 
trade deficit with the rest of the world fell to 79 billion down 
21 percent from 102 billion in august 
after quickly digesting the trade news the exchange market 
moved slowly in the morning because of a lack of new incentives 
said kenichi nakao a dealer with the mitsubishi bank 
finance minister ryutaro hashimoto told a news conference friday 
that japanese monetary authorities are continuing to watch 
developments in the foreign exchange market carefully while 
maintaining contact with other group of seven industrial nations 
a strong dollar tends to boost the us trade deficit by making 
imports cheaper and pushing up the prices of american goods on 
foreign markets 
the group of seven is comprised of the united states japan 
britain france west grmany italy and canada 
on the stock market the nikkei index rose following the 
favorable reaction to the improvement in the us trade balance 
many market players had predicted a deficit of 89 billion 
investors actively sought shares over a broad range said a 
dealer with a major japanese securities firm who spoke anonymously

israel will not accept the palestine 
liberation organization at middle east peace talks despite 
pressure from the bush administration israeli prime minister 
yitzhak shamir told jewish leaders 
shamir speaking to a gathering of american jewish groups on 
thursday called the plo a brutal terrorist organization totally 
disqualified as a partner to peace 
on this issue we have a difference of view with some of our 
american friends shamir told the 3300 representatives from the 
council of jewish federations which includes some 200 jewish 
communities 
shamir met with former president reagan in cincinnati earlier in 
the day and praised the understanding and support of the reagan 
administration but he indicated disagreement with president bush 
at least on the plo question 
there are legitimate differences between us shamir said 
after all it is only natural that the united states government 
wants to see tranquility and peace in the middle east and regards 
the ways and means to that end as secondary in importance 
but for israel every step towards that common objective is 
fraught with risk one blunder can be fatal these differences 
cannot and will not change the very solid friendship between our 
nation israel is a loyal and dependable ally 
outside the cincinnati convention center a small group of plo 
supporters carrying signs urged united peace talks earlier shamir 
had been given a statement from a group of american jews 
criticizing him for his hardline stand 
take back this message to the people of israel there is a 
very high cost for your endless stalling the letter said we 
who support israel are deeply concerned that unless you make a 
realistic commitment to pursue a political settlement you will do 
lasting damage to the state of israel and to the jewish people 
the letter was delivered by michael lerner editor of tikkun an 
oakland califbased magazine of liberal jewish thought lerner 
said the statement was endorsed by a meeting of 900 jewish 
intellectuals last sunday in san francisco 
uri dromi a los angelesbased representative of the world 
zionist organization said presenting the letter to shamir was an 
embarrassment 
its unfair to twist israels arm by putting pressure on the 
prime minister in this way dromi said he is the elected prime 
minister of israel and we should support him

took a strong lead in the initial round of brazils first free 
presidential vote since 1960 but two leftist rivals vowed to join 
forces against him in a runoff 
partial returns from wednesdays voting indicated that collor de 
mello would fall short of capturing the majority he would need to 
avoid a second round of balloting against the runnerup 
the solid showing by the left raised the possibility of a 
leftist victory in a runoff which would be held dec 17 
wednesdays balloting marked the return of full democratic 
rights after 21 years of military rule about 82 million brazilians 
voted and brazils superior electoral court said the count will not 
be completed until saturday 
as of thursday night collor de mello led with 27 percent of the 
vote radical leftist rep luis inacio lula da silva was second 
with 17 percent populist leonel brizola another leftist followed 
with 16 percent 
those numbers were based on 21 percent of the vote 
however a large number of votes from brizola strongholds in the 
heavily populated south had not been counted the electoral court 
said in a statement 
an unofficial tally by brazils largest tv network globo tv 
also gave collor de mello 27 percent 
but it put brizola of the centerleft democratic labor party 
in second with 18 percent of the vote and da silva of the 
marxistoriented workers party in third with 16 percent 
sen mario covas of the leftofcenter brazilian social 
democracy party had 12 percent of the ballots 
the network said its tallies were based on 60 percent of the 
vote 
brizola and da silva promised to join forces to battle collor de 
mello in a runoff 
we have to forget our differences and unite if the peoples 
choice falls on lula i will be the first to campaign for him to 
defeat the right brizola said thursday at a news conference 
da silva said his party would form alliances with whichever 
progressive force goes to the second round 
all the different points of view between us brizola and covas 
are minor when compared with our differences with collor de 
mello da silva a 44yearold former union leader said at a 
press conference in sao paulo 
collor de mello refused comment until all the votes were counted

the 50pound bird donated by the national turkey federation 
dined on grains prepared by a chef at a hotel blocks from the white 
house on the eve of todays presentation to president bush at a 
rose garden ceremony 
the turkey and its understudy were two of about 15 to 20 birds 
picked out of a flock raised in detroit lakes in northwest 
minnesota they were isolated from 5000 other turkeys so they 
could be pampered in preparation for their photo opportunity 
with the president 
this year were expecting something thats just a little bit 
different said eddie aldrete a spokesman for the turkey 
federation in washington it will be a little more ceremonial 
because the bush family is very very traditional and theyre big 
turkey lovers 
the bushes will donate the broadbreasted white turkeys to the 
frying pan park a petting farm which has horses cows pigs 
sheep chickens ducks goats and peacocks but no turkeys yet

business stinks for tom boughner but the 
man who runs skunkbusters wouldnt have it any other way 
it started out kind of as a big joke boughner a former 
sheriffs deputy in otsego county in northern michigan said of his 
family business we were having big problems with them here 
when boughner found out the department of natural resources 
doesnt make skunk calls he decided he would do it at first he 
picked up the skunks for free 
it started more or less as a community service helping people 
who couldnt get help anywhere else he said 
in four years boughner estimates hes removed as many as 100 
skunks from beneath houses inside barns and a variety of other 
places once he evicted 17 skunks from the yard of a lawyer 
another time he had to shove from the front of course a 
skunk stuck in a basement window 
he claims he has never been sprayed although his traps 
certainly have even so he reserves a special pair of overalls and 
an otterskin hat for the task

the seabrook nh nuclear power plant is 
nearing the end of its long regulatory journey 
friends and foes of the 63 billion plant agreed thursday that 
a decision by the nuclear regulatory commission to take over all 
pending issues confronting the plant will speed it toward a 
fullpower operating license 
if the nrc as expected awards seabrook a license the federal 
courts would be the last forum for opponents to fight the plant 
opening 
on thursday the nrc took out of the hands of the atomic safety 
and licensing appeal board the issue of whether emergency 
evacuation plans for new hampshire residents near the plant are 
adequate the commission said it would decide those issues and then 
proceed with its final review 
it certainly speeds up the final outcome whatever that is 
said rick bornemann spokesman for united illuminating corp which 
owns the secondlargest share of the seabrook plant 
plant spokesman rob williams said we feel that the commission 
will be in a position to issue the license around the end of the 
year 
opponents of seabrook meanwhile reacted angrily to the nrc 
decision 
i am absolutely outraged by its action this morning sen 
john kerry dmass said i will ask for a speedup of the 
congressional investigation of nrc procedures that we called for 
this week

older women were less likely than younger women 
to have had a pap test for cervical cancer in the past year even 
though the risk of the disease increases with age the national 
centers for disease control reported 
a study of women in 15 states showed that 988 percent of the 
women had undergone at least one pap test and 72 percent had 
undergone one within the previous year 
eightyone percent of the women aged 18 to 39 had taken a pap 
test in the preceding year the cdc said compared to just 67 
percent of those 4059 and 52 percent of those 60 and older 
although cervical cancer incidence and mortality increase 
with age pap smear screening decreases with age the 
atlantabased cdc said therefore improving cervical cancer 
screening among older women should be emphasized 
the american cancer society recommends annual pap tests 
beginning with the onset of sexual activity although after three 
negative tests a womans physician may recommend less frequent 
testing 
more black women than white women had undergone a pap test in 
the preceding year by a margin of 82 percent to 71 percent but 
the cervical cancer rate for black women was twice that of white 
women in 1986 the last year for which data were available 
medical care delivery to underserved populations may be an 
especially challenging problem since screening is only one of 
several key components to prevention the cdc said other 
factors influencing incidence and mortality trends include prompt 
notification of pap smear results adequate patient followup and 
appropriate treatment 
higherincome women were more likely to get annual tests 
seventyfive percent of those making more than 20000 a year had 
had pap tests in the preceding 12 months compared to 65 percent of 
those making under 10000 
cervical cancer which kills about 5000 us women each year 
can be prevented with early detection and treatment 
taken in 1988 the survey was conducted with 8741 women in 15

the san franciscooakland bay bridge was to 
reopen to cars tonight at midnight after a celebration of the quick 
repair job on the span that was damaged in the oct 17 earthquake 
singer tony bennett belted out i left my heart in san 
francisco at the close of an open party on the bridge thursday 
but changed the line about coming home to you san francisco 
to make it oaklandsan francisco 
the ceremony featured speeches by gov deukmejian san francisco 
mayor art agnos and oakland mayor lionel wilson lauding the repair 
job on the 53yearold bridge which took exactly one month 
deukmejian called the bridges reopening the first major event 
of the rebuilding process for northern california which was 
struck by a 71 magnitude quake that killed 66 people and caused 7 
billion in damage 
the politicians spoke from a stand just a few yards from the 
spot where the temblor sent one end of a 50foot section of the 
bridges upper deck plunging onto the lower deck one person died 
when the car she was in fell into the gap 
thousands of people walked from both ends of the bridge to the 
ceremony but stopped short of the damaged section where some minor 
work remained to be done 
wilson jokingly reminded agnos that he was sitting in oakland 
now the break was on the alameda county side of the bridge the 
two mayors had carried on a keen rivalry during the world series 
between the oakland athletics and the san francisco giants the 
series symbolized by the bridge on tshirts and other items was 
interrupted by the temblor 
those who marched on the bridge from san francisco included 
susan palumbo 42 who was in a bus on the bridge when the 
earthquake hit 
i didnt feel the quake but it was scary because we were 
waiting for an aftershock to take the bridge down said palumbo 
meanwhile a panel of engineers said the repairs have made the 
bridge as strong as it was before the oct 17 temblor but said 
that another similar quake would seriously damage the span 
mother nature performed an experiment that showed the bridge 
was not designed adequately said geologist robert e wallace 
chairman of the bay conservation and development commissions 
engineering criteria review board 
it failed in a very distant earthquake he said the 
epicenter of the quake was in the santa cruz mountains about 70 
miles to the south 
the bridge one of the mosttraveled in the world carried an 
average of more than 260000 vehicles every work day before the 
quake 
in the past month commuters who normally drove the bridge to 
work had to travel longer slower alternate routes or use mass 
transit

us clergy decried the murder of six jesuit priests in el 
salvador as an unspeakable atrocity with the national council of 
churches urging congress to halt delivery of military aid to el 
salvador 
we fear for the lives of our brothers said the rev joseph 
berra a fellow member of the roman catholic order who knew the 
victims and worked in san salvador before moving to texas in august 
the bush administration readying a new shipment of arms to 
confront a rebel offensive said it will press for an 
investigation and congressmen are threatening cuts in military aid 
unless the murderers are brought to justice 
if the government does not bring to justice those responsible 
we would have no choice but to try to severely limit salvadoran aid 
next year said rep david obey dwis chairman of the house 
appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over foreign aid 
william walker us ambassador to el salvador called the 
slayings a barbaric act and compared them to the 1980 killings 
of three nuns and a laywoman five former salvadoran national 
guardsmen were convicted of those killings 
it is obviously going to have a negative impact on the 
government of el salvador walker said 
the salvadoran government denied responsibility and condemned 
the slayings as savage and irrational president alfredo 
cristiani said he had ordered an investigation 
in austin texas berra held a news conference with two other 
jesuits who also worked in san salvador before coming to the 
university of texas 
the rev doug marcouiller said fellow jesuits in el salvador 
told him 30 armed uniformed men carried out the killings 
their bodies were riddled with bullets and their heads had 
been smashed he said this while an attachment of 80 soldiers 
was encamped about 100 yards away 
marcouiller said the jesuits had been denounced as sources of 
subversion on salvadoran radio and subjected to threats the 
jesuits house was bombed but no one was killed 
the extreme right now in power has for more than a decade 
accused local jesuits and their university of fostering subversive 
ideology 
the national council of churches governing board holding its 
semiannual meeting in pittsburgh unanimously approved a resolution 
urging the bush administration to halt military aid to el salvador 
and do everything possible to end the 10yearold civil war there 
we certainly hope the action we have taken will help prevent 
further atrocities happening there said the rev syngman rhee 
installed thursday night as the councils presidentelect 
the resolution also calls on el salvadors government and rebel 
forces to protect civilians and cooperate with humanitarian 
agencies and asks that churches and religious groups have 
unrestricted access to endangered civilians 
the council americas largest ecumenical body comprising 32 
denominations with a combined membership of 42 million christians 
including most major protestant denominations also advised members 
to be ready to provide emergency aid to churches in el salvador 
seattle roman catholic archbishop raymond g hunthausen called 
the killings an unspeakable atrocity and urged an end to us 
military aid to el salvador 
about 75 people gathered near the salvadoran consulate in 
chicago thursday evening some carrying white crosses bearing the 
names of those killed while the rev raymond baumhart president 
of jesuitrun loyola university said the school was stunned by 
the deaths 
these are men who dedicated their lives to service of others 
they committed themselves to living and serving the poor and the 
uneducated they ministered to men and women who suffered the 
effects of the war in san salvador baumhart said we pray that 
they will not have died in vain 
baumhart noted that one of the slain priests the rev ignacio 
ellacuria rector of jose simeon canas central american university 
received an honorary doctorate from loyola in 1986 
the rev thomas schubeck professor of religious studies at 
clevelands jesuitrun john carroll university interviewed 
ellacuria in april for a book on liberation theology he said the 
jesuits work on behalf of the poor made them targets for the right 
theyve removed a number of important educators good thinkers 
who stood for people he said it was a vengeful kind of 
execution 
the dead included ellacuria university vicerector ignacio 
martinbaro the revs segundo montes amado lopez juan ramon 
moreno and joaquin lopez lopez their housekeeper julia elba 
ramos and her 15yearold daughter celina

an assemblywoman banned from receiving 
communion because of her public advocacy of abortion rights says 
she is troubled by the sanction but will not change her prochoice 
position 
i knew that i was not in agreement with the church hierarchy 
but i thought it all through a long time ago assemblwoman lucy 
kilea said thursday i felt comfortable with it intellectually 
spiritually and emotionally thats where i wanted to be 
bishop leo t maher took the action wednesday one day after 
killea began running a series of prochoice television 
advertisements as part of her campaign for a state senate seat 
it is believed to be the first such sanction imposed on a 
catholic elected official in the united states since a gathering of 
bishops last week in baltimore agreed to intensify the churchs 
antiabortion stand said frances kissling who heads the 
washingtonbased catholics for a free choice 
the bishops have been sorely stung by the large number of 
catholic politicians who publicly disagree with them on the 
question of abortion kissling said and as is typical they 
have chosen to make their first example a woman 
though his authority is limited to his local diocese maher said 
his sanction will prevent killea from receiving communion 
wherever she goes 
were doing this because the politicians have failed to 
recognize their obligation to bring their catholic faith and 
morality into the public arena he said thursday 
killea a democrat is running against republican assemblywoman 
carol bentley in a special election scheduled dec 5 
killea said she would continue going to mass regularly but 
would abide by mahers order and not take communion 
i was surprised at the punitive nature of actually taking 
action against me she said but as he is the bishop ill 
respect his authority and i wont receive communion when i go to 
mass 
maher denied that killea was unfairly singled out 
no catholic can responsibly take a prochoice stand when the 
choice in question involves the taking of a human life he said 
the right to life is a fundamental right without it there are 
no other rights 
killea consistently has voted for abortion rights legislation 
since her 1982 election to the assembly but has not been 
particularly outspoken on the subject until the current campaign

a man convicted of raping and murdering his 
cousin while he was on a brief leave from prison was put to death 
in the electric chair this morning 11 years after the crime 
arthur james julius gave two thumbs up and waved both hands 
nodding in the direction of his brother clarence byrd and prison 
chaplain robert simmons before being executed at 1209 am 
julius 43 of birmingham was sentenced to death for the 1978 
rape and killing of his cousin 29yearold susie bell sanders at 
her montgomery apartment 
in his final words julius said he held no ill feeling toward 
the warden or the two lieutenants that were in the execution 
area holman prison commissioner morris thigpen said he 
understood they had a job to do and did not hold it against them 
thigpen further quoted julius as saying he believed in god and 
knew he would not let him suffer 
julius had pinned a purple ribbon on the shirt of his white 
sweatsuit prison officials said the ribbon is worn by death row 
inmates to protest the death penalty 
he was the fourth inmate to die in alabamas electric chair this 
year and the 119th person put to death in the united states since 
the 1976 us supreme court ruling allowing states to resume use of 
the death penalty 
julius had lost an appeal to the us supreme court about eight 
hours before the execution 
the high court refused by a 72 vote late thursday afternoon to 
spare julius life justices william j brennan and thurgood 
marshall who oppose capital punishment in all circumstances 
supported julius emergency plea for a stay of execution 
julius was serving a life term for a 1972 jefferson county 
murder when he was released on a pass from a prison workrelease 
center near montgomery 
according to court records julius left on an 8hour pass at 11 
am on jan 29 1978 and borrowed a relatives car from 330 pm 
to 625 pm during that time julius turned ms sanders apartment 
into a shambles beating her and dragging her through rooms and 
subjecting her to grotesque sexual abuse before strangling her 
ms sanders body was discovered by her 5yearold daughter 
the victims parents told reporters in january that the 
execution was long overdue her father has since died family 
members declined comment when contacted by phone this week

a radio announcer chattered away 
until he was cut off in midsentence a few moments later he was 
back on the air with an apology sorry folks its a brownout 
power outages are nothing new for manilas 7 million 
inhabitants but since october they have occurred daily fraying 
the nerves of residents who also must cope with rising crime 
horrific traffic and uncollected garbage 
some officials and newspaper commentators say the brownouts also 
are threatening the economy 
when the electricity problem worsened last month president 
corazon aquino ordered the staterun national power corp to end 
the brownouts 
but the corporation which generates power for sale to private 
distributors announced thursday that brownouts will increase 
because of the deplorable state of the luzon island electricity 
network 
until nov 26 electricity will be cut three times a day for two 
hours at a time after that selective cuts will continue until at 
least the end of the year the corporation said 
the prospect does not include unscheduled power failures caused 
by faulty equipment or system overloads 
pat gutierrez spokeswoman for the national power corp blames 
the problem on low water levels this year at hydroelectric plants 
and damage suffered by major power plants during recent typhoons 
however critics also fault the government for neglecting the 
luzon power system since the final years of the late president 
ferdinand marcos administration 
we are now suffering the cumulative effect of neglect poor 
management poor planning and deferred maintenance over the last 
six years said sen john osmena 
the power cuts come without warning in one building near manila 
bay office workers rush to the elevator shaft during brownouts to 
check if anyone has been trapped inside the elevator 
brownouts also snarl the already tenuous operations of the 
philippine long distance telephone co and halt pumps that deliver 
water to many buildings 
the continuing brownouts have reached national emergency 
proportions complained the newspaper tempo it is wreaking 
havoc on every facet of philippine life 
private companies that own their own generators can cope but 
many companies and government agencies simply close when brownouts 
occur in the afternoon 
workers who leave early often find themselves bogged down for 
hours in monstrous traffic jams because traffic lights also are 
turned off 
one official at the department of education speaking on 
condition of anonymity sometimes takes a long siesta during the 
brownouts 
im lucky because my desk is near the window and i can still 
work she said everybody else just sleeps 
no official figures are available on how the power crisis is 
affecting the economy but anneli lagman supervising specialist at 
the national economic development authority said production will 
definitely be affected in the last quarter of this year 
industrial output is down 15 percent due to the long power 
shortage said the manila standard it did not provide a source 
for the figure 
so much for the economic recovery or president aquinos 
pronouncement about the country being an investment haven 
the newspaper said 
mrs aquino has been trying to lure foreign investment with such 
statements 
sport events also have been disrupted by the brownouts 
several games in the maharlika cup tournament of the philippine 
amateur basketball league have been rescheduled because the lights 
went out during play 
one can just imagine the tens of millions of pesos lost in 
terms of wasted manhours because of the daily brownouts 
complained columnnist art borjal in the philippine daily star 
computers conk out factories stop humming classes are 
suspended traffic flow goes awry and people can only cry and curse 
why the dark ages have returned to a place thats supposed to be 
the countrys capital region 
among other things sen osmena called for foregoing the garish 
christmas lights strung up in suburban makati so far city 
officials have refused but have urged individuals to conserve power 
by cutting back on christmas lights at home 
people have begun to joke about dreaming of a black 
christmas in asias only predominantly christian country

hungary has become the first east 
european country to apply for membership in the council of europe 
a western european political organization 
yugoslavia and poland also indicated they would apply 
hungary applied for membership thursday foreign minister gyula 
horn said membership would provide a very good basis that will 
enable us in the near future to enter into close cooperation with 
the european community 
the 12 nations belonging to the european community trading bloc 
also are members of the council of europe but the organizations 
are not formally linked 
horn who met thursday with foreign ministers attending a 
regular meeting of the council in strasbourg said he hoped that 
hungary might even become a member of the european community 
he said he expected his country to join the council of europe 
within six to nine months or at all events in 1990 
catherine lalumiere secretarygeneral of the 23nation council 
of europe said if hungary maintains its pace of political reform 
it could become the organizations first east european member in a 
year or so 
set up in 1949 the strasbourgbased council is particularly 
active on the issues of human rights and legal and cultural 
cooperation 
horn said membership would not be incompatible with hungarys 
position in the warsaw pact the sovietled military alliance 
we dont want to break away from that alliance or even want to 
call our membership of that alliance into question horn said 
foreign minister budimir loncar of yugoslavia said he had 
outlined his nations reforms to the council 
asked if belgrade planned to apply for membership next spring 
he replied it will most likely be as you predict 
polands foreign minister krzysztof skubiszewski said 
poland has the intention to apply but we did not file any formal 
demand today 
he said it was difficult to say when poland could seek 
membership adddingi think its too early for us to do it 
membership is open only to european countries with democratic 
multiparty parliaments 
hungary plans multiparty elections for next year in august 
poland formed the east blocs first government led by a 
noncommunist since they consolidated power in eastern europe after

president mikhail s gorbachev indicated in 
remarks published today that multiparty government might someday 
come to the soviet union but he ruled out private ownership of 
farms and factories 
the soviet leader rejected current calls for allowing political 
parties other than the ruling communist party 
the official news agency tass quoted him as saying there was 
no other political force capable of both renewing the bodies of 
soviet power and consolidating society 
however he also said any constitutional provision including 
the article giving the communist party the leading role in shaping 
soviet society may be subjected to a reassessment 
transformation and editing if the need arises even to its 
deletion from the constitution 
the east bloc has been swept by a wave of political reform this 
year 
poland formed a government led by a noncommunist in august and 
hungary plans to switch to multiparty rule after elections next 
year east germany and bulgaria appear to be undertaking more 
limited reforms 
gorbachevs remarks were made wednesday during a 
questionandanswer session that followed a speech to a national 
forum of students the speech was broadcast wednesday night on 
official media and the questionandanswer session late thursday 
the president said he was open to a large variety of different 
forms of running the economy which would through lease 
cooperation individual farms etcetera make the individual the 
master with authority to manage the means of production 
however gorbachev said that although many changes are possible 
in the era of perestroika he remained committed to the marxist 
concept that the state should own the means of production 
he said he believed in the communist manifesto which calls for 
state ownership of production to ensure that workers get full value 
for their effort without factory owners taking a share as profit 
the manifesto was written in 1848 by karl marx and friedrich 
engels as the blueprint for communism 
the soviet legislature is currently debating bills to define 
various forms of property including proposals that would permit 
private ownership of some property and longterm leasing of state 
farms and industry 
i do not think that at the stage of preparing a law on 
property and ownership we should put forth and lay down the 
advancement toward private property gorbachev told the students 
addressing international issues gorbachev said german 
reunification was hardly realistic today but as to how history 
will turn out in the future we will live and see 
gorbachev and soviet spokesmen have previously expressed strong 
opposition to any possibility of reunification of east germany and 
west germany 
there has been speculation about reunification since east german 
leaders opened their borders to the west earlier this month in 
response to street protests for reform and the exodus of citizens 
to the west

organizers hailed a lastminute decision by the 
national endowment for the arts to fund an art exhibit on the aids 
epidemic as a split decision in favor of free expression 
nea chairman john e frohnmayer who earlier this month had 
rescinded a 10000 grant awarded in may said thursday that he 
would release the grant 
the exhibit at the artists space gallery features paintings 
photographs and sculpture by 23 artists and contains several 
explicit depictions of male genitals and controversial religious 
images 
frohnmayer had disputed the programs catalog which includes 
derogatory references to cardinal john j oconnor roman catholic 
archbishop of new york and to lawmakers who supported a bill 
restricting funding of art considered obscene 
but after seeing the exhibit he relented 
after consulting with members of the national council on the 
arts several of whom have also seen the show i have agreed to 
approve the request of artists space and will release the grant 
for the exhibition only he said 
show organizers accepted the money but stood by the catalogue 
we are pleased to accept the grant that the show is receiving 
the press attention it deserves and the issues of free speech 
free expression public funding for the arts censorship and 
selfcensorship are becoming clear to the american public said 
susan wyatt executive director of the gallery 
she said frohnmayers decision was made possible by a 
technicality the grant was awarded in 1989 before passage of the 
bill banning grants to art deemed obscene 
we were unwilling to compromise and i dont believe we as a 
people should either she said 
the show which had a total budget of 30000 opened to the 
public thursday night 
we won a battle but the war is still on the war against 
homophobia aids phobia and any undermining of our freedom of 
speech said nan goldin organizer of the exhibit witnesses 
against our vanishing 
conductorcomposer leonard bernstein refused to accept a 
national medal of arts in protest when the nea indicated it would 
rescind the grant white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
thursday 
the catalog contained an essay by david wojnarowicz a 
photographer with aids which labeled oconnor a fat cannibal in 
a black skirt he also said he fantasized about setting helms on 
fire and throwing us rep william e dannemeyer off the empire 
state building 
wyatt said she was honored to be associated with the essay and 
said she was moved by its power its truth and its beauty 
the exhibit was intended to show how aids has devastated the 
arts community it includes graphic photographs of naked men and at 
least one woman though most of the works are abstract one 
sculpture shows a christ figure wearing lipstick and mascara 
last week frohnmayer said the show lacked artistic merit 
several artists in the show signed a petition calling for 
frohnmayers resignation 
in a statement taped to the gallery walls goldin said all 
art is political by nature there can be no personal freedom 
without freedom to express oneself sexually and politically in 
ones art and in ones life

up to 6 million soviets would visit aboard or 
emigrate under a proposed law that would ease travel regulations 
compared with 22 million this year a soviet official said 
the official commented thursday at a news conference on a bill 
making its way through the soviet legislature it would lift most 
of the travel restrictions that soviet citizens and international 
leaders have complained about for decades 
soviet officials argued that the more liberal law would 
encourage soviets to stay home instead of fleeing their country as 
east germans have done 
there will be no need to be reckless and go for permanent 
residence abroad first you should go and see said rudolf a 
kuznetsov the head of the soviet agency that issues visas 
the more democratic and liberal the exit rules the less 
people want to leave and this is corroborated by the recent 
example of the german democratic republic said anatoly g 
kovalev a first deputy foreign minister 
he was referring to the nov 9 decision by east germanys 
communist leaders under the pressure of street protests and mass 
emigration through socialist countries to open borders to free 
travel and begin reforms 
most east germans who crossed into west berlin west germany 
through openings in the berlin wall returned after a brief visit 
kuznetsov said 5 million to 6 million of the 287 million soviets 
are expected to emigrate or travel abroad next year he gave no 
breakdown 
legislator fyodor burlatsky said on monday that he expects 
500000 to emigrate next year 
by comparison kuznetsov said that by the end of this year 
200000 people are expected to emigrate and 2 million to travel 
abroad 
us commerce secretary robert mosbacher said in washington the 
easing of soviet emigration laws would open the soviet union for 
mostfavorednation trade status with the united states 
in the past tens of thousands of jews and other soviets were 
refused exit visas a policy the west repeatedly censured 
the soviet legislation would allow emigration for virtually 
anyone who has entry permission from another country and no 
outstanding alimony obligations criminal charges or recent 
knowledge of state secrets 
it would set a limit of five years on the period a citizen can 
be kept from emigrating because of access to secrets 
kovalev and other officials promised that emigration and foreign 
travel would be barred in only very limited cases but in an 
apparent reference to the exodus from east germany he added that 
the kremlin was not in favor of a mass flight to the west 
the soviet state as any other is not interested in 
stimulating the exodus of its people to foreign countries he 
said the brain drain of talent did not strengthen any state 
many of the fleeing east germans are young and skilled 
kovalev bristled at a reporters suggestion that soviets like 
many east germans might become fed up with domestic economic 
troubles and choose to leave each has his own reasons and the 
situation in the german democratic republic is quite different 
he said 
the officials cited several factors that might limit emigration 
the heavy workload of visa officials immigration restrictions 
imposed by other countries the difficulty of obtaining plane 
tickets to fly out of the soviet union and limits on the amount of 
money soviets can convert into foreign currency

hewing to the party line on reforms in the eastern bloc portraying 
them as harbingers of a stronger socialism 
socialism is going through a phase and theres some basic 
changes in its nature gus hall 79 chief of the communist party 
usa for 30 years said thursday that doesnt mean socialism 
is dead 
its becoming what i would call peoples socialism socialism 
in which the communist party is not the sole political leader and 
the communist parties have to share power in building socialism 
hall said 
the notion of communist powersharing is as surprising coming 
from hall as from his counterparts in the east long rigid in his 
ideology hall still expresses admiration for joseph stalin and 
chafes at communist flirtations with private enterprise 
but sudden and remarkable reforms have swept communist eastern 
europe culminating last week in east germanys opening of the 
berlin wall which split communist east berlin and democratic west 
berlin for 28 years 
thats great said hall who has supported moscows moves as 
they ranged through the decades from crackdown to growing openness 
i said long ago that the berlin wall will come down i dont 
think its needed now 
in a telephone interview he expressed views that diverged 
sharply from his hardline history including support for free 
elections in eastern europe and the soviet union he predicted that 
socialists would win them 
it will result in loosening the socalled political monopoly 
that the communist parties have had he said that was 
necessary in the initial stages and in difficult periods of war 
but theyre not necessary now and they havent been for some time 
thats old habits 
halls view left one student of american communism unimpressed 
hall is obviously very upset with whats going on in the 
socialist world said harvey klehr a political science professor 
at emory university in atlanta 
you can keep saying the communist system is reforming itself 
whats really happening is the people of those countries have 
decided to abolish communism said klehr a specialist in 
american radicalism 
thats tough for someone like hall whos been a communist all 
his life to accept that people who live under it cant tolerate 
it 
during the communist scare of the early 1950s hall spent eight 
years in federal prison at leavenworth kan for conspiring to 
overthrow the government by force a charge he rejects 
he said the communist party usa has 20000 members klehr 
said 10000 to 15000 is probably closer

senate democrats say they have the votes to 
defeat president bushs controversial nominee for a top natural 
resources job and will prove it if bush doesnt withdraw the 
nomination 
sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the senate agriculture 
committee said thursday that he would seek a vote before congress 
recesses for the year unless bush acts 
leahy who has led the opposition to james e cason said he 
would like withdrawal or a promise that bush would not appoint 
cason during the recess an action that would circumvent the senate 
confirmation process 
cason who has been a highranking official at the interior 
department since 1982 was nominated to be assistant secretary of 
agriculture for natural resources and soil conservation 
leahy and others opponents say his record at interior showed a 
preference for private development interests over environmental 
concerns 
james cason would lose on the senate floor because both 
democrats and republicans would vote against him leahy said 
the votes are not there to confirm him he said in a 
speech on the senate floor 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine said he was willing to 
go ahead with a vote but minority leader bob dole rkan said 
thursday he wanted to wait 
we totally support the nomination and have no intention of 
withdrawing it said alixe glen white house deputy press 
secretary 
none of us likes to turn down a presidents request for a 
person for a job in his administration leahy said james cason 
is the wrong man for the wrong job at the wrong time 
john tower bushs first choice for defense secretary is the 
only nominee so far to be defeated on a floor vote unlike tower 
however cason was approved by the committee that interviewed him 
the agriculture committee voted 127 to send the nomination to 
the floor despite leahys misgivings 
however sen harry reid dnev then exercised his right to 
put a hold on further action because he opposed cason 
hes a james watt clone said reid in a reference to the 
former interior secretary whose prodevelopment policies angered 
environmentalists 
that gave other senators more time to review casons record 
sen bennett johnston dla the chairman of the energy and 
commerce committee joined leahy in a letter to the other senators 
calling on them to vote against the nominee 
last week sen bob kasten of wisconsin became the first 
republican to oppose cason announcing on the floor of the senate 
his intention to vote against the nominee 
on tuesday sen lloyd bentson dtexas issued a statement 
saying he would vote against cason and thought the president 
should seek out another better qualified nominee for the 
position

the mayor of one town today 
vowed to keep blacks off the local beach but elsewhere there was 
acclaim for the presidents declaration that segregation of beaches 
and other public amenities would end 
whitesonly signs came down on one beach near cape town and 
a black consumer boycott of whiteowned stores was called off in 
the industrial city of boksburg a year after it was launched to 
protest the reintroduction of segregation ordinances by the 
farright conservative party 
our protest had the desired effect said danny cassels of 
the save boksburg committee we have won the day 
in mossel bay a town on the southern coast controlled by the 
conservatives mayor johan ooosthuizen said the local beaches would 
remain whitesonly as long as possible 
but in the strand another coastal town in cape province the 
town council held a special meeting thursday night after president 
fw de klerks announcement and voted to take down their 
whitesonly beach signs immediately in august police used 
whips to chase antiapartheid protesters off that beach 
we are an inextricably mixed country with blacks hugely 
outnumbering whites said an editorial in the citizen a 
progovernment daily welcoming the announcement there is no way 
we can unscramble the races or go on having amenities for whites 
only 
de klerk said thursday that the government would repeal as 
soon as possible the separate amenities act of 1953 which 
allowed local officials to segregate public facilities the act 
cannot be repealed before parliament convenes in february but the 
president urged local officials to open whitesonly beaches 
immediately 
today provincial affairs minister hernus kriel asked the 
administrators of the coastal natal and cape provinces to repeal 
all provincial beach apartheid laws kriel said such a move would 
overrule any local segregation ordinances and make town councils 
liable for legal action if they retained whitesonly beaches 
city councilors in durban the largest city with segregated 
beaches are to hold an emergency meeting this weekend to decide 
their course of action but the mayor derek watterson said he 
welcomed de klerks decision 
the announcement also was priased by the national chamber of 
commerce and tourist industry officials 
otto stehlik chief executive of the protea hotel chain 
recalled an incident where a mixedrace accountant staying with his 
family at the chains mossel bay hotel had been forcibly removed 
from the segregated beach legislation to outlaw such practices 
could not come soon enough he said 
the separate amenities act has empowered white local governments 
to bar blacks from parks libraries swimming pools civic centers 
buses and public toilets 
in many communities most or all public amenities now are open 
to all races but whitesonly facilities exist in the capital 
pretoria in many rural towns and in several small industrial 
cities where the conservative party took power in municipal 
elections last year 
in boksburg one of those conservativecontrolled cities mayor 
beyers de klerk who is not related to the president said the 
time had come to form a whitesonly homeland 
repeal of the separate amenities act would still leave major 
areas of segregation in south africa residential neighborhoods 
medical care and public education 
it also would leave intact the political system that gives the 5 
million whites domination over the 32 million blacks asians and 
people of mixedrace

a white former police captain 
has admitted leading a death squad that he says was responsible for 
assassinating several antiapartheid activists a newspaper 
reported today 
national police headquarters denied the existence of any police 
hit squads but said the wild allegations would be investigated 
dirk coetzee who resigned from the force in 1986 told the 
afrikaanslanguage newspaper free weekly that he participated in a 
police hit squad until august 1982 and described several killings 
in great detail 
coetzee said he had kept in contact with the units members and 
knew of further misdeeds committed after he left the group 
free weekly said it interviewed coetzee on the indian ocean 
island of mauritius after he left south africa last week with his 
family to start a new life 
coetzee said the death squads included former african national 
congress guerrillas who chose to work with police after they were 
captured 
a statement from police headquarters said the minister of law 
and order and the commissioner of police have repeatedly stated 
that no socalled hit squads exist 
topranking police officials and the attorney general of the 
orange free state province will investigate coetzees charges 
police said 
but the statement added it seems strange that capt coetzee 
now makes these unfounded untested and wild allegations from a 
foreign country where he cannot be questioned to verify these 
claims 
police did acknowledge the previously secret unit made up of 
blacks who formerly belonged to the anc the main black group 
fighting to oust the whiteled government they provide the force 
with valuable intelligence and also play a cardinal role in the 
identification of anc terrorists infiltrating south africa 
police said 
coetzee told the newspaper i was the commander of the south 
african polices death squad my men and i had to murder political 
and security opponents of the police and the government 
i myself am guilty or at least an accomplice to several 
murders the newspaper quoted him as saying 
coetzee is the second former policeman recently to admit being 
part of a death squad last month a black former security 
policeman on death row was reprieved the day before his scheduled 
execution when he said he had killed black antiapartheid attorney 
griffiths mxenge in durban in 1981 
the former policeman butana nofomela said he had participated 
in nine police killings of antiapartheid activists 
nofomela was sentenced to hang for a murderrobbery of a farmer 
which took place after he had left the force and had no apparent 
political overtones 
according to free weekly coetzee listed the mxenge murder among 
the acts committed by the squad to which he belonged

housing starts rebounded 12 percent in october 
to their highest level in nearly three years after falling in 
september to their lowest point since the 1982 recession the 
government reported today 
the commerce department said new homes and apartments were built 
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 142 million units last 
month up from a revised 127 million units in september starts 
had fallen 46 percent in september and 64 percent in august 
the october gain was the largest since a 13 percent advance in 
december 1986 
septembers 127millionunit pace was the most sluggish rate 
since new homes and apartments were being built at an annual rate 
of 117 million units in october 1982 during the depths of the 
198182 recession 
the housing construction industry has been one of the economic 
sectors slowed by high interest rates caused by the federal 
reserves grip on credit as it strives to cut inflation 
in addition to its effect on construction jobs and the building 
materials industries the housing industry has an impact on other 
housingrelated businesses such as home appliances and furnishings 
but fixed mortgage rates had fallen from their march peak of 
1122 percent according to the federal home loan mortgage corp 
or freddie mac and some analysts have been looking for an increase 
in construction freddie mac said fixed rates stood at 982 percent 
at the end of october 
economist michael p niemira of mitsubishi bank in new york said 
builders seem less concerned by interest rates than the pace of new 
sales 
niemira noted that while new home sales had fallen 14 percent in 
september existing home sales had risen 43 percent 
this seems to suggest that home buyers are looking for more 
affordable houses which builders are not providing he wrote in 
the banks weekly economic indicator report 
total housing starts during the first 10 months of the year are 
down 6 percent from the same period of 1988 
construction of singlefamily homes in october rose 69 percent 
to an annual rate of 103 million units singlefamily starts had 
fallen 3 percent in september and 35 percent in august 
apartment construction rose 28 percent in october to an annual 
rate of 393000 units it had fallen 94 percent in september after 
dropping 14 percent in august 
the south turned in the sharpest increase up 171 percent to 
562000 units followed by the midwest with a 165 percent gain to 
289000 units 
construction in the northeast rose 6 percent to 176000 units 
and rose in the west 51 percent to 393000 units 
applications for multifamily building permits a barometer of 
future multifamily housing activity were up 05 percent in 
october following a decline of 7 percent in september 
overall applications for building permits rose 07 percent after 
falling 07 percent in september

us military aid to el salvadors government 
will be stepped up in light of its war with leftist guerrillas but 
members of congress are threatening future cuts unless the fighting 
stops and the murderers of six priests are brought to justice 
this is probably another case of rightwing death squad 
activity said rep david obey dwis referring to the brutal 
torture and killing of six jesuits at a university in san salvador 
if the government does not bring to justice those responsible 
we would have no choice but to try to severely limit salvadoran aid 
next year added obey chairman of the house appropriations 
subcommittee with jurisdiction over foreign aid 
there is brutality and murder on both sides said sen 
patrick leahy dvt obeys senate counterpart the right 
justifies it in the name of the lord the left justifies it in the 
name of liberation and the people die in the middle 
in many ways i feel like saying a pox on both your houses 
if our aid means nothing if our influence means nothing everybody 
has to understand that at some point we will leave leahy 
said 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said thursday 
that ambassador william walker was asking salvadoran president 
alfredo cristiani for a full inquiry into this horrendous act 
both the government and the military have denied involvement in the 
killings of the priests and two housekeepers 
we do not know who it was and thats one point i would like to 
emphasize walker said today on cbs this morning 
ms tutwiler said the salvadoran military has asked the united 
states to speed up deliveries of munitions already purchased 
primarily light weaponry and riot control equipment and that we 
are moving to address their needs 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater later said an 
investigation into the killings had already begun and added we 
will be watching this investigation closely 
on capitol hill several lawmakers said the united states should 
join in a red cross call for a 72hour ceasefire to evacuate 
civilians and the wounded it would be a good first step said 
sen nancy kassebaum rkan 
congress is poised to send an additional 85 million in military 
aid and 12 million for police training and equipment to el 
salvador for the current fiscal year but the money has been held 
up by unrelated disputes over other items in a 146 billion 
foreign aid bill 
ms tutwiler said the united states is confident of the 
cristiani governments ability to defeat the guerrillas who began a 
major offensive earlier this week 
we believe the salvadoran government is able to manage the 
situation she said

bombs damaged the homes of two 
legislators who defied a christian leader and participated in 
presidential elections aimed at solving lebanons political crisis 
police said today 
also today the central bank stopped sending cash to banks and 
government institutions in east beirut and the christian enclave to 
the north the move was seen as yet another attempt to pressure the 
christian leader gen michel aoun to drop his opposition to newly 
elected president rene mouawad 
no casualties were reported in the explosions thursday night 
outside the homes of deputies michel sassin a greek orthodox and 
farid serhal a maronite catholic police said but window glass 
was shattered and doors blown out 
neither of the christian parliamentarians was at his residence 
at the time sassin is abroad and serhal is at his hometown of 
jezzine in south lebanon 
similar explosions have damaged the homes of christian deputies 
tarek habshi elias hrawi elias elkhazen and august bakhos as the 
interchristian feud escalated in recent weeks 
the explosions were another violation of a ceasefire that began 
in september after six months of intense fighting in beirut between 
christian forces and syrianbacked moslem militias that killed more 
than 2000 people 
christian legislators have not returned to the enclave to avoid 
aouns wrath after they approved without his consent a peace plan 
to settle the civil war during a special session in saudi arabia in 
october 
mouawad was elected nov 5 one day after aoun head of an 
interim cabinet that had ruled christian regions for 13 months 
declared he had disolved the 99seat parliament but legislators 
said the move was illegitimate because under the constitution only 
a president can dismiss the chamber 
aoun has insisted on a syrian troop withdrawal from lebanon 
before the election of a president he rejected the peace pact 
reached in saudi arabia because it contained no fixed timetable for 
a syrian evacuation syria has 40000 troops in lebanon under a 
1976 arab league peacekeeping mandate 
mouawad designated salim hoss a veteran sunni moslem 
politician to form a cabinet of national reconciliation aoun has 
threatened to cut the throats and tongues who defy his 
rejection of mouawads election and the peace plan and agree to 
take part in hoss government 
central bank governor edmond naim a maronite based in 
syrianpoliced moslem west beirut said in a statement he stopped 
the cash flow to east beirut to force aoun to deposit tax revenues 
collected in the christian enclave 
a source at naims office said aoun has collected about 28 
million in taxes and fees for public services in the past two 
months but refused to deposit them at the central bank however 
the move was also seen as an attempt to force aoun to support the 
new president

east germanys new premier today presented a 
28member cabinet that includes 11 noncommunists and called for 
more private enterprise to help the troubled economy but he 
rejected a freemarket economy 
in his first speech since taking office monday hans modrow also 
rejected the idea of german reunification as dangerous and 
unrealistic 
the 500member parliament met today to approve modrows proposed 
cabinet which will replace the body that resigned nov 7 
east german media said communist party chief egon krenz approved 
the cabinet makeup thursday and no serious opposition was expected 
in parliament which convened a twoday session today 
despite more than a third of the seats being given to 
noncommunists the proposed cabinet includes several holdovers 
from the former hardline leadership of erich honecker and the 
party still dominates 
the noncommunists all come from parties that have been 
communist allies 
after modrows speech however manfred gerlach head of the 
liberal democrats announced his party would no longer run in 
elections in a bloc with the communists and called for true 
sharing of power in free voting 
his party was given three seats in the new cabinet in the past 
the cabinet has been subservient to the communist party leadership 
gerlach has proposed ridding the constitution of the communists 
40year monopoly on power and a parliamentary committee was to be 
set up to study that and other possible changes 
modrow in his speech to parliament outlined hopes for 
improving the lives of east germans while retaining a planned 
socialist economy 
he said the nation is open for proposals on joint ventures 
investment transfer of profits and environmental pilot projects 
all of which address some of the concerns of western business 
looking for openings in the east german market 
the government sees as its most urgent responsibility the 
stabilization of the economy modrow said 
he called for increasing individual responsibility of the 
economic units and the introduction of some private enterprise to 
encourage east germans to produce goods and services to help end 
shortages 
modrow urged improvements in the sometimes stifling planned 
economy but rejected a full freemarket economy 
he called for a better socialism with better supplies of 
consumer goods and a full and varied life for the east german 
population 
modrow also suggested legal and political reforms including 
removal of restrictions that prohibit unauthorized public 
gatherings and free expression authorities have tolerated massive 
prodemocracy demonstrations in east germany in recent weeks but 
such demonstrations remain technically illegal 
east german leaders have been struggling to retain a basic 
socialist system in a nation swept by prodemocracy activism and 
tempted by offers of aid from west germany in return for 
freemarket reforms 
we must have unwavering political and ideological tolerance 
modrow said apparently referring to western appeals for east 
germany to accept some capitalist reforms

a navy boat was swamped as it returned to 
base to participate in an unprecedented servicewide standdown 
for safety none of 10 sailors aboard was injured 
the accident thursday occurred as most of the navy began two 
days of safety exercises for its sailors around the world after 10 
accidents in the past three weeks killed 10 people and injured at 
least 71 
the 36foot navy seafox was swamped in stormy weather on the 
nearby york river a virginia institute of marine science vessel in 
the area picked up the 10 sailors who were not injured said lt 
cmdr steve burnett an atlantic fleet spokesman in norfolk 
at no time was it a lifethreatening situation he said 
for most of the navy whether in port or at sea thursday began 
48 hours of drills lectures inspections and dialogue about the 
services job and how to do it safely 
it gives us a chance to step back from the trees and see the 
forest said lt cmdr mike john another atlantic fleet 
spokesman 
navy secretary h lawrence garrett iii and adm carlisle ah 
trost chief of naval operations on tuesday ordered all navy units 
to complete 48 hours of safety work within 72 hours most atlantic 
fleet units began the standdown thursday morning though some 
began wednesday burnett said 
garrett defended the navys safety record in a speech in 
jacksonville fla in spite of the string of accidents he said 
that although no common problem linked the accidents the 
standdown would be a success simply because of the number of 
people involved 
it is the human error that we will allow them to reflect upon 
during this time garrett told the jacksonville council of the 
navy league 
on the guided missile cruiser uss josephus daniels the seamen 
were gathered in compartments going over the procedures for 
everything from the handling of surfacetoair missiles to the 
electrical safety checking of personal radios 
lt jg paul ward the ships assistant damage control officer 
saw the standdown as a good way to stress safety to all hands 
everyone here has to be a capable firefighter when there is a 
fire on board you cant just run away there is nowhere to 
run ward said 
standdowns are not unusual but capt ferguson norton 
commander of the naval safety center and the navys top safety 
officer said this is the first servicewide standdown in memory

after a while you start equating safety with combat 
readiness lt cmdr ken heimgartner the squadron commander 
said as he watched his young ground crew go over his aircraft 
when you start seeing something unsafe thats an indicator you 
may not be combat ready 
at the miramar naval air station in san diego rear adm phil

is everything still coming up roses for 
gypsy 30 years after the jule stynearthur laurentsstephen 
sondheim musical first opened on broadway 
well almost for those needing proof the evidence is on 
display at the st james theater where a revival opened thursday 
after a long national tour for much of the evening the production 
reaffirms the shows reputation as one of the greatest american 
musical comedies 
gypsy a showbiz saga about the quintessential stage mother 
is a nearperfect amalgam of book music and lyrics the brash 
brassy music is stynes best theater score try listening to that 
overture with those original orchestrations by sid ramin and 
robert ginzler and not shiver sondheims lyrics are playful but 
not simplistic and laurents tough lean book is fast furious and 
funny an affectionate yet never sentimental look at the dying days 
of vaudeville 
so the only question about any major broadway revival is how 
well these elements are served and who plays rose the greedy 
grasping gorgon of a mother whose little girl louise grows up to 
become the stripper gypsy rose lee 
its a difficult role not only because it anchors the whole 
show but because of who has played it in the past the 
largerthanlife ghost of ethel merman hovers over the musical she 
made rose her own in 1959 and if a lot of todays theatergoers 
didnt see her they have the original cast recording to make 
comparisons others caught the 1974 revival starring angela 
lansbury whose acting ability made up for what she lacked in vocal 
power 
now tyne daly best known as the star of televisions cagney 
and lacey has taken up the challenge and she has succeeded 
with one drawback 
the woman is a terrific actress and even has a few mermanesque 
qualities she talks tough and can bully with the best of them in 
scenes when she tries to find jobs in vaudeville for her daughters 
baby june and louise 
and she also has a girlish flirtatious side that her 
predecessors lacked its a quality that makes her scenes with the 
lovestruck herbie the onetime candy seller turned agent work 
better than they ever have before it also helps that herbie is 
beautifully played by jonathan hadary a mournful basset hound of 
an actor 
but any performer playing rose must do more than act much of 
roses fierceness and determination is expressed in song the woman 
has three important solo numbers in the show some people 
everythings coming up roses and roses turn they define 
her character and the musical itself 
daly gets through them adequately but one misses the vocal 
fireworks that make them terrifying hymns of selfdelusion and 
overconfidence 
as a result much of the shows musical pleasure shifts to the 
other songs roses softer numbers such as small world 
youll never get away from me and together stand out as 
well as the tacky vaudeville sequences such as dainty june and 
her farmboys and that ultimate showstopper you gotta have a 
gimmick 
the latter is staged to perfection by bonnie walker who 
recreated jerome robbins original choreography the three aging 
strippers are played by barbara erwin anna mcneely and jana 
robbins never has overthehill been so appealing and funny 
their sexiness is made more apparent by the bland impression of 
the budding gypsy rose lee done by crista moore her strip numbers 
are stiff and unconvincing more as if she is doing her duty than a 
dance but robert lamberts all i need is the girl captures the 
poignancy as well as the exhilaration of the song 
the rest of the cast is fine particularly a gaggle of perfectly 
obnoxious children drilled to military precision by author 
laurents who also doubled as director 
kenneth foys backstage settings are not elaborate and look as 
if they had been made for touring not broadway that goes for the 
costumes by theoni v aldredge too 
but its not the sets or costumes one remembers from gypsy 
its laurents glorious story of show business dreams and those 
wonderful songs if dalys vocal talents dont overwhelm her 
acting ability more than compensates you can understand from her 
performance why the indomitable mama rose would want to get into 
show business in the first place 
what other critics said 
frank rich the new york times ive always had only one 
choice in the category of favorite musical it is gypsy and as 
i sat at its scorching new revival starring tyne daly once again 
swept up in its goosebumpraising torrents of laughter and tears i 
realized why if anything this 30yearold show actually keeps 
improving with age gypsy is nothing if not broadways own 
brassy unlikely answer to king lear it speaks to you one way 
when you are a child then chases after you to say something else 
when youve grown up 
clive barnes new york post daly goes through the motions with 
a trouperlike diligence and loving histrionic care this 
gypsy is not bad it might keep a few camp fires burning but 
it is not as fantastic as it needed to be it is a show that called 
for rethinking rather than reviving 
howard kissel daily news the solidity and power of gypsy 
are clear in the revival directed by arthur laurents tyne 
daly has the energy she has a resilient though not very sizable 
voice but shes not the force of nature you need for the 
monstrous heroic rose

dropped on rebel strongholds 
several hundred guerrillas descended overnight from the hills 
above the northern neighborhood of mejicanos to try to take control 
of the main streets

the sunday correspondent of london was caught in a crossfire and 
wounded early today blundy was shot in the right shoulder and 
taken to rosales hospital where he was listed in serious condition

appeared to have backed down after intense housetohouse combat 
fighting also raged in northern zacamil a neighborhood the 
rebels have held since saturday 
about 1500 guerrillas of the farabundo marti national 
liberation front are thought to be involved in the attack in san 
salvador 
thousands of salvadorans have been forced to flee their homes 
and many have blamed the guerrillas for their misery 
we were caught in the cross fire angel erazo said thursday 
as she clutched a kitten in one hand and a bag of clothes in the 
other it was a horrible night 
residents of one neighborhood who had been without food for days 
looted a marketplace 
we have no food no money nowhere to go sobbed adilia 
hernandez of zacamil 
rebel leaders have acknowledged they cannot win the war the 
guerrillas estimated to have 7000 fulltime fighters and 11000 
backups nationwide are heavily outnumbered by the 56000member 
salvadoran army and other security forces 
the rebels said they attacked to prove the army also cannot win 
they say rightist president alfredo cristiani cannot govern 
without granting a role to their front 
the guerrillas began their attacks saturday three days after 
they broke off peace talks with the usbacked government 
claiming it was not serious about reaching a settlement

aerial assaults of the pesticide malathion to 
fight mediterranean fruit fly infestations have renewed the 
controversy over what some environmentalists and politicians say is 
a health risk 
aerial spraying of a 22squaremile area about 15 miles north of 
downtown was completed early today in the latest effort by 
agriculture officials to eradicate the pest more spraying was 
scheduled over several areas next week 
the latest fertile fly discovery occurred wednesday in hacienda 
heights with the trapping of a male insect earlier this week a 
pregnant medfly was found in north hollywood a previously 
unaffected san fernando valley suburb 
the green party a political group dedicated to environmental 
issues scheduled a demonstration monday to protest use of the 
chemical party chairman randall toler said 
he said the cancercausing potential of malathion remains under 
review by the federal government the group calls for the use of 
sterile medflies instead of pesticides to halt the infestation 
toler said agriculture officials were caught flatfooted 
without adequate supplies of sterile medflies 
millions of the laboratorysterilized flies were released after 
sprayings to fight previous infestations with the goal of breeding 
fertile flies out of existence 
officials authorized double malathion sprayings over infested 
communities including north hollywood burbank studio city and 
toluca lake after a supply of sterile medflies ran out 
city councilman richard alatorre who represents an infested 
district wrote to state food and agricultural director henry voss 
clearly the mediterranean fruit fly is a serious menace to the 
welfare of this region and ultimately the state it is equally 
clear however that one of the weapons used in the battle to 
eradicate this menace malathion is itself of questionable safety 
to the health of humans exposed to it 
carol ward spokeswoman for the los angeles county department of 
health services defended malathions use against the medfly which 
lays its eggs in more than 250 varieties of fruits and vegetables 
threatening the states 16billionayear agriculture industry 
we feel strongly that the doses that are sprayed are not going 
to cause any health problems ms ward said she said less than 
an ounce of malathion is spayed per acre

former president reagan is under orders to 
turn over documents by wednesday to john poindexter who says his 
alleged crimes in the irancontra affair were authorized by the 
president 
in an order issued thursday us district court judge harold 
greene said poindexter may serve upon former president reagan and 
upon the archivist of the united states the subpoenas submitted 
to the court 
the archivist has possession of presidential records of the 
reagan administration reagan took his diary with him when he left 
the white house 
greenes ruling marks the first time in the irancontra scandal 
that a judge has approved a subpoena for documents from reagan 
poindexters lawyers say they want reagans diary as well as 
notes he took at key meetings with his national security adviser 
but it is unclear what the subpoenas demand since greene did not 
disclose their contents 
the judge ruled last month that poindexter who was reagans 
national security adviser is entitled to subpoena specific 
relevant documents bearing on the criminal charges against him 
reagans lawyers who on thursday night declined to comment are 
almost certain to challenge the subpoenas but the justice 
department may be less likely to step into a legal battle 
reagan asked by reporters in cincinnati about the subpoena 
said cases like that before the law i dont comment 
the justice department will examine the reagan subpoena in light 
of the 1974 supreme court ruling on the watergate tapes said a 
justice department source speaking on condition of anonymity 
we are in the process of reviewing greenes order to 
determine what action we should take if any said justice 
department spokesman david runkel 
if it chose to do so the department could object to the 
subpoena on behalf of the former president as it did earlier this 
year in urging that a subpoena be quashed seeking reagans 
appearance at oliver norths irancontra trial 
during the watergate scandal the court ruled that president 
nixon had to comply with a subpoena from the special prosecutor to 
produce tape recordings of 64 conversations the court ruled that 
the specific need for the evidence in a criminal case outweighed 
the presidents rights in the matter 
poindexter says that in regard to his actions that led to his 
indictment in the irancontra affair reagan formulated the 
position on some matters and entertained poindexters plans 
without voicing any objection on others according to a court 
opinion greene issued last month 
it appears that notes were taken by the president and others 
on these conversations said the judge 
poindexter asserts that these notes or presidential diary 
entries made pursuant thereto would support his defense to the 
criminal charges against him greene noted 
poindexter has said he met daily frequently alone with the 
president during the irancontra affair 
poindexter who is scheduled to go on trial jan 22 is under 
indictment on two counts of making false statements to congress 
two counts of obstruction and one count of conspiracy he is 
accused of obstructing congress by denying that the national 
security council staff was offering tactical advice or soliciting 
funds for the contras 
earlier this year us district court judge gerhard gesell 
quashed a subpoena for documents sought from reagan in the case 
against oliver north 
among other topics poindexter said he and the president 
discussed the accuracy of a chronology on the irancontra affair 
the chronology said that no official in the us government 
learned before january 1986 that hawk missiles had been shipped to 
iran in november 1985 
the ciaassisted shipment overseen by north who kept 
poindexter informed on its progress occurred without the existence 
of a presidential finding as required by law reagan signed a 
retroactive finding the month after the hawks were transported to 
iran 
poindexter also said reagan took notes of discussions focusing 
on how to respond to congressional inquiries about whether the 
administration was secretly assisting the contras during a 
congressional ban on the use of appropriations by intelligence 
agencies to aid the rebels

the head of a presidential commission today 
promised a thorough investigation of the government response to the 
bombing of pan am flight 103 and told relatives of its victims 
we wont let you down 
nearly a year after the bombing over lockerbie scotland which 
killed 270 people former labor secretary ann mclaughlin opened the 
first of several hearings planned before the commission reports its 
findings to president bush next may 
we will let the chips fall where they may mrs mclaughlin 
said speaking for the sevenmember commission which includes four 
members of congress and two prominent military figures 
she said the commissions inquiry would evaluate existing 
aviation security procedures the handling of threats against 
airlines and whether the public should be notified of them and the 
governments treatment of victims of aviation terrorism 
four relatives of people killed aboard the boeing747 airliner 
testified at the opening of the hearing including bert ammerman 
president of victims of pan am flight 103 which had called for the 
investigation 
the american government has broken faith with its citizens it 
has turned its back on its responsibility to protect the lives of 
american citizens at home and abroad ammerman said he said 
security measures taken since the bombing have been little more 
than a lot of words 
he said those killed in the flight were caught up in an 
inescapable web of foreign intrigue evil forces unscrupulous 
airline practices government double standards and bureaucratic 
unaccountability 
in emotional testimony victoria cummock of coral gables fla 
described the badly damaged attache case of her husband who died 
aboard the flight and said ladies and gentlemen this is what 
remains of john cummock 
the widow said one of her three children 4yearold matthew 
one morning asked for a gun 
i asked him why he wanted a toy gun she said he said he 
didnt want any toy gun he wanted a real gun to shoot himself so 
we could all shoot ourselves in order to be with daddy 
mrs cummock said she wanted the commission to feel the effects 
of the disaster on her family so it would not be considered just an 
unfortunate isolated incident or an inconvenience in a system 
that occasionally goes on the blink 
we wont let you down mrs mclaughlin promised 
members of the commission include sens frank r lautenberg 
dnj and alfonse damato rny reps james oberstar dminn 
and john hammerschmidt rark former assistant navy secretary 
edward hidalgo and retired air force gen thomas c richards they 
were appointed by president bush last month 
relatives of some of the 189 americans killed returned last week 
from a trip to frankfurt west germany where the dec 21 1988 
flight originated they have been trying to get the german 
government to reveal more details about the flight 
the relatives are asking the presidential commission on aviation 
security and terrorism to fully and thoroughly investigate all 
leads into the cause of the bombing including pan ams security 
procedures 
they also want the commission to find out what the us british 
and west german governments knew about terrorist threats before the 
frankfurtlondonnew york flight 
the explosion over lockerbie scotland has been traced to a 
radio cassette player in the cargo hold but investigators have not 
determined who placed it there 
richard lally vice president of the air transport association 
which represents us airlines cited what he called a serious 
flaw in federal aviation administration security programs 
the faa should impose the same security requirements on 
foreign carriers serving the us as it imposes on us carriers 
lally said in his prepared testimony 
he noted that in 1985 and again after the lockerbie bombing the 
faa imposed extraordinary security requirements on us airlines at 
airports in western europe the middle east and far east while 
foreign airlines dont have to meet the same requirements 
the transportation department has ordered airlines to pay for 
sophisticated explosives detection devices but a bill pending in 
congress would require the government to pay the bill 
lally criticized the government program to install 150 of the 
thermal neutron analysis tna systems in airports by the end of 
1991 saying the equipment needs more testing 
all experts appear to be in complete agreement that tna does 
not present a full or final answer to the problem of explosives 
detection lally said the devices cost about 1 million each 
lally also urged the united states to adopt the montreal 
protocols that would increase the amount of damages victims can 
claim in terrorist attacks on commercial aviation

abandonment 
in 1981 at age 19 launders unwed put her baby up for adoption

kept the child without legally adopting her and named her lisa 
the girl died of brain injuries at age 6 steinberg 48 was

an outside counsel will investigate five 
senators who intervened with banking regulators to help a political 
contributor a source says indicating an intensified probe by the 
senate ethics committee 
the source speaking on condition of anonymity thursday did not 
say whether a counsel had yet been hired to investigate the 
senators who aided charles h keating jr when he was the chairman 
of the failing lincoln savings and loan of irvine calif 
but the new york times reported today the committee had decided 
to hire prominent washington attorney robert s bennett for the 
investigation as well as for an unrelated review involving sen 
alfonse damato rny a source says the senate ethics committee 
is reviewing allegations that damato violated rules in the 
department of housing and urban development scandal 
until now the ethics committees only known interest was a 
letter asking the five whether keatings contributions 13 
million to the senators campaigns or political causes prompted 
them to question regulators about their examination of lincoln 
the senators are alan cranston dcalif dennis deconcini 
dariz john glenn dohio john mccain rariz and donald 
riegle dmich cranston responded to the committee thursday as 
deconcini and riegle did earlier all denying any improprieties 
glenn and mccain have not yet filed formal responses but have 
denied wrongdoing 
also on thursday federal regulators handling the lincoln sampl 
failure seized a luxury resort and a hotel in arizona owned by 
keating 
bennett earlier this year was selected by the committee to 
investigate accusations that sen david durenberger rminn 
laundered 100000 in campaign contributions through a book 
contract 
the ethics committee does not formally announce a decision to 
proceed from an initial expression of interest to the first formal 
stage of a case known as a preliminary inquiry the inquiry 
determines whether theres a reason to believe rules violations 
occurred 
if the committee so decides it would begin an initial review to 
determine whether there is substantial credible evidence of 
violations 
the final step is a full investigation to decide if there is 
clear and convincing evidence that standards were violated and 
whether discipline should be recommended to the senate 
a standing senate order says that ethics committee 
investigations shall be conducted by outside counsel unless 
the select committee determines not to use outside counsel 
the congressional watchdog common cause had urged the outside 
counsel so that the results of the inquiry would be credible and 
accepted by the public 
cranston the democratic whip told the committee thursday that 
no further action is warranted in a formal response 
prepared by his attorney 
in an accompanying letter to committee chairman howell t 
heflin dala and vice chairman warren b rudman rnh 
cranston said his inquiries to the federal home loan bank board 
about lincoln were nothing more and nothing less than what he 
has done for other constituents with credible complaints about 
their treatment by a federal agency 
i am not responsible for loss of taxpayer funds through a 
delay in shutting down lincoln or the losses of innocent california 
bond investors cranston said 
cranstons spokesman murray flander said he had no further 
comment on the decision to hire a counsel adding we have no 
firsthand knowledge of it 
mccains office issued a statement saying i am confident that 
an investigation will vindicate my repeated statements that i never 
abused my office nor took actions that were improper 
riegle said today i strongly support whatever level of 
inquiry the senate ethics committee feels is appropriate their 
review will show my conduct in this matter to have been ethical and 
proper at all times 
deconcini issued a statement saying i welcome anything that 
will establish the facts and i will cooperate fully 
glenns aide dale butland said in columbus ohio the senator 
has not been ntified of this 
cranston mccain deconcini and glenn met with thenbank board 
chairman edwin gray on april 2 1987 and all five senators met a 
week later with regional officials from the boards san francisco 
office about lincoln 
cranston also phoned grays successor m danny wall last 
spring endorsing keatings failed attempt to sell lincoln before 
regulators obtained a court order to seize it 
regulators seized control of lincoln only last april they 
estimate taxpayers will have to cover between 2 billion and 25 
billion in federally insured deposits the thrift lost in the 
biggest sampl failure in history regulators have filed a 11 
billion fraud and racketeering suit against keating and his 
associates 
in addition hundreds of the 22000 bondholders who bought 
highrisk debentures in lincolns holding company american 
continental corp of phoenix through lincoln branches have sued 
keating after losing an estimated 200 million 
in arizona the federal regulators accompanied by fbi agents 
local police and private security guards took control of the 
phoenician a 605room golf resort near scottsdale and the 
344room crescent hotel in phoenix 
keating his wife mary elaine keating two daughters two 
sonsinlaw and 18 other associates were fired from management 
positions at the properties owned by a subsidiary of lincoln

on aug 4 1988 a federal grand jury in 
manhattan handed up the nations first indictment of wall street 
professionals on racketeering charges touching off a still noisy 
debate 
should the fearsome penalties of the racketeer influenced and 
corrupt organizations act so successful in the governments war on 
organized crime be used against criminals of the financial world 
honest businessmen have nothing to fear from the rico law 
said michael goldsmith a brigham young university law professor 
instead of worrying about rico with its stiff penalties and 
threat of asset forfeiture wall street ought to be saying 
lets come up with a remedy to our problems with fraud 
goldsmith said 
added joseph digenova former us attorney for the district of 
columbia no one seems to have a problem with applying rico to 
the colombo organized crime family or the genovese organized 
crime family they do have a problem apparently applying rico to 
people whose names dont end in vowels 
passed by congress in 1970 rico was designed to make it easier 
for prosecutors to root out mobsters by attacking seemingly 
legitimate businesses associated with organized crime 
prosecutors can win a rico conviction with unrelated crimes such 
as loansharking or mail fraud if they can convince a jury those 
charged were linked through a pattern of racketeering activity 
the law did not define any new crimes 
defendants convicted of rico violations are subject to maximum 
penalties of up to 20 years in prison hundreds of thousands of 
dollars in fines and possible forfeiture of illegal profits into 
the millions 
it is ricos forfeiture provisions that have caused most of the 
uproar through them prosecutors can obtain temporary restraining 
orders to freeze a defendants assets before trial to ensure the 
funds are available in the event a jury orders them forfeited as 
part of a verdict 
opponents of the law say it has been turned into a club to scare 
defendants into plea bargains and cooperation agreements 
it gives prosecutors a terrifying weapon said alan 
bromberg a securities law expert at southern methodist university 
im not sure our justice system should be getting people to plead 
guilty when they dont feel theyre guilty 
the case of princetonnewport partners lp involved the first use 
of the law against securities professionals last week a federal 
judge sentenced the six defendants to prison sentences of six 
months or less 
while the case achieved convictions the prison time imposed was 
minimal and the judge also reversed the jurys forfeiture verdict 
against four defendants ruling the harshness of the penalty did 
not match the gravity of the crimes 
the jury had awarded 38 million of the 21 million sought by 
prosecutors in forfeitures 
rather than confirm the effectiveness of rico in the prosecution 
of securities cases the judges actions only highlighted the 
problems inherent in the tactic 
defense lawyers contend the governments initial demands for an 
order freezing the firms assets even though it was not charged 
with wrongdoing destroyed princetonnewports ability to raise 
money and forced it out of business 
in response to such criticisms the justice department recently 
issued new guidelines for freezing rico defendants assets and also 
sharply limited the use of racketeering charges in tax cases 
the underlying crime charged in princetonnewport was mail fraud 
for a phony stocktrading scheme to generate bogus tax losses 
the justice departments tax division has since warned 
prosecutors that congress did not include tax offenses in the rico 
statute and charging a tax offense as a mailfraud charge could 
be viewed as circumventing congressional intent unless unique 
circumstances exist 
what could be more telling of the abusive nature of the 
charges than the new justice department guidelines that there 
cannot be another princetonnewport case asked paul grand a 
defense attorney at the trial 
bruce baird former head of the securities fraud unit in the 
manhattan us attorneys office that prosecuted princetonnewport 
said the case complied with guidelines in place at the time charges 
were brought 
in addition he said princetonnewports assets were never 
actually frozen the firm failed he believes because of the 
indictment itself not the battle over the assets 
but gerald lefcourt another defense lawyer in the case said 
that until a judge approved a bond to guarantee the defendants 
funds the whole firms assets were under a cloud 
thats like restraining general motors because the government 
wants your 1000 shares he said 
the racketeering law was used most prominently as a basis for 
indicting some of the 48 people charged in chicagos commodities 
pits as well as former drexel burnham lambert inc junkbond chief 
michael milken total forfeitures against milken and two 
codefendants could approach 12 billion 
drexel then the nations fifthlargest securities firm last 
year said it agreed to plead guilty to six felony charges and pay 
650 million in fines and restitution to avoid a racketeering 
indictment that could have frozen its assets and crippled its 
operations 
theres no question rico is effective smus bromberg said 
but steamrollers are effective too 
g robert blakey a university of notre dame law professor and 
one of the architects of the rico statute said drexel may have 
lost far more if it had been convicted of racketeering 
drexel got a good deal just like a street offender who plea 
bargains he said

a decision by france to return three mirage 
fighterbombers to libya is raising concern at the state department 
the partial lifting of a french arms embargo was linked by the 
department to an accord libya signed in august for a peaceful 
settlement in chad 
libya and france were on opposite sides in a war in the african 
country 
the department said libya is supporting rebels in violation of 
an explicit prohibition in the agreement 
also the department said in a statement distributed friday 
libya continues to pursue development of chemical weapons and to 
support terrorism 
france decided this week to return to libya three fenchmade 
supersonic mirage fighterbombers that had been held after being 
returned to aerospatiale factories for repairs in 1986 
foreign ministry sources in paris requesting anonymity said 
the return of the three aircraft one mirage f1 and two 
mirage5s purchased in 1970 did not conflict with a decision by 
the european community in 1986 ruling out the delivery of new 
armaments to libya 
the sources said the return of the planes was authorized 
following the aug 31 agreement for a peaceful solution to the 
border dispute between libya and chad 
but the state department said we are quite concerned and 
disappointed with this decision we do not believe that now is the 
time to weaken sanctions against libya 
the statement said libya had not demonstrated concrete changes 
in its policies of supporting terrorism and destablization

president bush has sent a cable to soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev expressing hopes for a calm and 
peaceful period of change in eastern europe as democratic reforms 
are adopted the white house said today 
the message echoed the theme of a cable that gorbachev sent to 
bush last friday 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater told reporters the 
president indicated his support for the changes in eastern europe 
and the reforms under way in the soviet union 
he said the united states wants a calm and peaceful period of 
change in eastern europe as poland hungary and east germany seek 
to implement their reforms the spokesman said 
the president said he believes these historic steps will make 
a positive contribution to a europe that is whole and free 
fitzwater said 
the message was dispatched to moscow on thursday evening and 
will be delivered by us ambassador jack matlock 
the cable was written after a week of consultation between the 
united states and western allies 
a week ago fitzwater had said that gorbachevs message to bush 
underscored the importance of the changes taking place and 
expressed the hope that the situation will remain calm and 
peaceful 
bush and gorbachev will meet dec 2 and 3 on ships off the coast 
of malta for their first summit 
fitzwater said the dominant issue will be the changes in eastern 
europe and their impact on the north atlantic treaty organization 
and the warsaw pact and eastwest relations in general 
bush talked by telephone today with president francois 
mitterrand of france prime minister brian mulroney of canada and 
chancellor helmut kohl of west germany about events in eastern 
europe and the summit 
fitzwater said bush and mitterrand agreed to talk again after a 
meeting of european leaders this weekend and before bush sits down 
with gorbachev bush and mulroney also said they would talk after 
malta 
in preparation for the talks bush planned to confer at the 
white house today with four former us ambassadors to the soviet 
union george kennan malcolm toon thomas watson and arthur 
hartman 
on saturday the president will hold two meetings with 
thinktank experts and other soviet specialists concerning domestic 
politics in the soviet union and eastwest relations in general 
fitzwater said the structure of the summit calls for general 
discussions rather than specific of pinpoint kinds of proposals 
he said the united states was not concerned that gorbachev might 
spring a surprise on bush as he did with thenpresident reagan 
when he proposed sweeping arms cuts during the reykjavik summit 
fitzwater said obviously if president gorbachev makes a 
proposal the president will say well thats very interesting 
why do you feel that way and whats your reasoning and hell 
give him his points of view and his ideas and say well take 
these matters up with the allies and well talk about them again at 
our next summit 
fitzwater added we dont anticipate any negotiating going on 
there or the emergence of any specific agreements in any kind of 
formal fashion

accepting defeat on their main abortion 
battleground this year prochoice house members today set up 
future fights by introducing a bill that would write into law the 
1973 supreme court ruling that legalized abortion 
the bill also would in effect overcome a highcourt decision 
last summer that gave states greater leeway to impose restrictions 
on abortions supporters said 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo a sponsor said the bill would 
forbid states to limit a womans right to have an abortion before 
the time her fetus becomes viable for life outside the womb 
although no action was expected until next year abortionrights 
backers said the bill could become the central focus of future 
congressional and political debate on the abortion issue and 
could thrust the abortion issue even further into the 1990 
congressional races 
this bill is the moral equivalent for women of the 1964 civil 
rights act said rep les aucoin dore 
a version also will be introduced in the senate supporters said 
abortionrights supporters in the senate on thursday ended their 
efforts to overcome president bushs veto of a bill that would 
extend medicaid abortions to women who are victims of rape or 
incest 
i leave it on the conscience of the president that poor women 
will continue to be denied their right of choice when they become 
pregnant by an act of extreme sexual brutality sen tom harkin 
diowa said thursday 
the senate followed the house by a day in acceding to bushs 
demands when he vetoed a bill that would have permitted federal 
money to pay for medicaid abortions for poor women who are victims 
of rape or incest 
both chambers gave voicevote approval to a 157 billion 
spending bill for labor health and education programs that 
included language insisted upon by bush it continues the 
prohibition on federally financed abortions in all cases except 
when the life of the mother is in danger and she cannot afford to 
pay for the abortion 
the president last month vetoed a similar version of the 
appropriations bill that contained a provision expanding the 
abortion financing to cover rape and incest the house failed by 51 
votes to override 
although the rape and incest provision would cover a relatively 
small number of additional abortions by most estimates the issue 
became a symbolic battleground in the political struggle over 
abortion 
that struggle has taken on increased intensity since the supreme 
court last summer gave states more leeway to regulate abortions 
and proponents of abortion rights won key elections last week in 
virginia and new jersey 
the action ended for now the main congressional fight over 
abortion although there were other abortionrelated skirmishes as 
congress pressed toward adjournment 
in another abortion issue a 146 billion foreign aid bill was 
stymied by differences over a provision giving 15 million to the 
un population fund the house reversed itself and voted down a 
move by abortion opponents to strip the money out of the bill 
because the agency operates in china where a onechildperfamily 
policy has led to forced abortions 
both sides also were watching to see whether bush would sign or 
veto a spending bill for the district of columbia he vetoed an 
earlier version because it permitted funding of abortions congress 
passed a new version that prohibits the dc government from using 
federal money on abortions but permits the city to use local money 
for abortions 
if he signs it it will be a victory for us aucoin said

twentytwo physicians learned that the fbi 
still makes house calls when agents arrested them for allegedly 
trying to steal medicaid money by prescribing expensive equipment 
for nonexistent patients 
the doctors as well as several physicians assistants office 
managers physician impersonators and a pharmacist were accused of 
demanding kickbacks in return for writing bogus prescriptions for 
items such as oxygen tanks and wheelchairs 
the distributor of such equipment in this case a businessman 
who was working undercover for the authorities would then be free 
to bill medicaid for an item he never had to provide to a patient 
william doran head of the criminal division of the bureaus new 
york office said such a scheme was as much a moral violation as 
a legal violation fraud like this drives medicaid costs even 
higher 
most of the physicians were arrested in a series of raids 
thursday by state and federal agents they are now painfully 
aware of the fact that the fbi still makes house calls doran 
said 
kickbacks in the case ranged as high as 29000 according to 
us attorney andrew maloney only one of those accused was a 
firsttime violator he said 
edward j kuriansky a state special prosecutor said the 
accused physicians most of them foreigners were part of an 
influx of foreign nationals from places such as pakistan 
indonesia and haiti who have come here principally to rip off the 
medicaid system 
such doctors have few community ties and frequently flee before 
they can be caught he said

parliament today ousted former communist 
party leader todor zhivkov as head of state and replaced him with 
petar mladenov the new party leader who promised radical 
political and economic reforms 
lawmakers also approved a series of government changes that 
drove out some hardliners loyal to zhivkov and put reformers into 
positions of power 
the lawmakers removed article 273 of the penal code which was 
broadly used to punish anyone deemed to have slandered the state or 
communist party this means that independent groups which have in 
the past have been harrassed by authorities will have more freedom 
the national assembly also created an ecology ministry to 
address enviornmental concerns raised by one of those groups 
ecoglasnost 
todays moves along with harsh criticism of zhivkov came 
during the first live television broadcast of a parliament session 
in the history of bulgaria 
they continued the dizzying pace of reform that began in 
bulgaria on nov 10 when the hardline zhivkov was suddenly ousted 
as party leader after a 35year tenure and replaced by mladenov 
who was the foreign minister 
after the parliament meeting 10000 chanting bulgarians 
attended a statesponsored rally in downtown sofia to support the 
leadership changes and call for zhivkov to be tried in court 
they loudly cheered lawmaker slavcho trnski who launched an 
unprecedented attack on zhivkov during todays parliamentary 
session 
mladenov in his acceptance speech today said he would 
implement sweeping political and economic reforms but he did not 
give specifics 
the new socialist bulgaria will have more respect for 
rights and freedom for all bulgarians said mladenov 
the new leader also called on the unicameral parliament 
traditionally as in other soviet bloc countries a rubberstamp 
body for party decisions to take a more active role in 
controlling party and government work 
dropped from the government today were petko danchev a deputy 
premier and stoyan ovcharov minister of economy and planning 
both were zhivkov men who were ousted as nonvoting members of the 
politburo on thursday 
stoyan mihailov a reformer who was removed from the central 
committee and stripped of his ideology portfolio under zhivkov last 
year was made minister of eduction and culture the post could 
prove to be important as mladenov seeks to garner support from 
intellectuals in carrying out reforms 
nikolai dankerov was appointed to head the new ecology ministry 
an voyko dimitrov was named mladenovs successor as foreign 
minister 
the 400member national assembly voted unanimously by a show of 
hands to oust zhivkov as head of state and to replace him with 
mladenov deputies praised mladenov for his enthusiasm for 
perestroika soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs reform program 
trnski delivered a scathing attack on zhivkov to the stunned 
deputies accusing the former leader of having led the country into 
deep economic crisis while leading a flamboyant lifestyle 
he called for the real truth to come out about zhivkov who 
he said owned 30 homes around the country not even the richest 
countries in the world could stand those expenses he said 
he also charged that zhivkov was hungry for fame and held 
onto power by pursuing a policy of divide and rule 
zhivkov often carried out personnel changes in the top party and 
government echelons to consolidate his power 
trnski called for an investigation into what he described as 
misuse of funds by zhivkovs son vladimir he was purged from the 
central committee thursday and was rumored to be involved in 
several scandals 
also thursday the central committee ousted three hardline 
politburo members and promoted four liberal communists who are 
expected to back mladenovs reforms 
in other changes today 
andrei lukanov who was elevated to politburo member and 
central committee secretary thursday was relieved of his duties as 
minister of foreign trade observers speculated he would be 
mladenovs no 2 man in the party his deputy georgi pirinski 
replaced him 
kiril zarev was named minister of economics and belcho belchev 
was named finance minister a new post 
mincho yovchev who was promoted to the politburo on thursday 
was named to head a new ministry of industry and technology 
under zhivkov this balkan nation had been one of moscows most 
loyal allies during the rule of former soviet leader leonid 
brezhnev despite a program outlined by zhivkov in july 1987 which 
seemed to call for reforms little was done to implement them and 
those who tried were removed from power 
mladenov is considered a wellconnected politician with good 
relations in moscow where he was educated state media have said 
mladenov has already been in contact with gorbachev who greeted 
his appointment as party leader 
mladenov has emphasized the continued leading role of the party 
but at the same time has initiated direct dialogue with prominent 
nonconformist intellectuals who belong to independent groups 
he has moved quickly to secure his position in the party 
informed sources said further toplevel changes were expected in 
the party and government to clear communists loyal to zhivkovs 
rule

beginning a reporting trip to east germany 
associated press correspondent hanns neuerbourg shared a train ride 
with some east german visitors returning home from west germany 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the animated chat about a shopping 
spree just completed in the west came to a sudden halt as the 
nurembergleipzig express crossed into east germany 
in the border zone where communist guards with submachine guns 
once shot to kill wouldbe escapees the watchtower stood empty 
as the train drew to a halt at probstzella the first stop in 
east germany only a bearded man in a windbreaker holding a 
halfempty bottle of beer kept talking 
any official check gives me an uneasy feeling something like 
going to the dentist said a middleaged woman returning from her 
first trip to the west in 34 years but maybe this time it will 
be different 
it was a smiling east german policewoman looked only passingly 
at the identity papers these included a passport stamped with a 
visa that authorized a reporter to make five days of unlimited 
travel in east germany 
a second policeman followed then a woman customs official 
there were no questions and no checks of the luggage the 
parcels and the shopping bags piled up to the compartments ceiling 
the police officer did not react when the man with the beer 
bottle slapped him jokingly on the shoulder 
they are completely insecure now said the man later they 
have no instructions so they just dont do anything 
it is really the new beginning said a woman in her mid30s 
peeling an orange as the train resumed its voyage 
i still have my doubts countered her neighbor there are 
too many wendehaelse she added using a word that is used to 
refer to turncoats 
i feel a bit embarrassed said another woman as the talk 
returned to shopping 
taking those 100 marks 54 welcome money makes you almost 
feel like living on the dole she said of the money provided the 
visitors by the west german government 
dont worry she was reassured all that money stays in 
west germany anyway but how will things look back here in the 
east 
prices will go up replied a woman who said she was the wife 
of a baker we are told that bread will go up from 93 pfennigs to 
280 marks in january 
east german marks are nominally equal in value to west german 
marks which are worth about 54 cents but on the black market or 
at west german currency exchanges the east german currency only 
goes for onetenth the nominal rate 
its evident said another woman that these subsidies 
will have to go imagine i pay 60 marks per month in rent for a 
5room apartment 
and i paid 36 marks for a pair of designer stockings in the 
exquisit chimed in another referring to a stateowned chain of 
east german luxury stores its completely crazy 
as the train rolled into saalfeld the bearded man emptied his 
last bottle and put it carefully into the shopping bags where it 
joined several others empty bottles can be returned for five 
pfennigs in east germany 
a woman said i am homesick it was an amazing experience in 
this consumer temple but now i am glad to be back 
the bearded man started singing what was once a popular tune 
in der heimat angekommen faengt ein neues leben an 
back home a new life begins

a quick stop for pastries cost 4000 
friday when a car rolled from its parking spot and hit one 
building then changed direction and slammed into a restaurant no 
one was injured 
ive been a policeman for five years and this by far and above 
is the most unusual thing ive ever seen said patrolman mark 
waggamon 
ramona wagner 52 of wallace parked in front of a bakery and 
left her cars motor running while she went inside waggamon said 
the transmission apparently slipped from park into reverse and 
the car traveled backward and up the street across three lanes of 
traffic and struck the front of the galleria mini mall the 
patrolman said 
he said the force of the collision then shifted the transmission 
into either neutral or drive and the car rolled off in another 
direction 
the car struck a newspaper vendor rack which fell over and 
hit a parked van and traveled on eastward and through the front 
window of mccrorys restaurant waggamon said 
the buildings are within 75 yards of each other 
sandra cunningham 41 of clarksburg was the only person in the 
restaurant 
i was putting money in the cash register getting ready to open 
up when the car came through cunningham said i couldnt 
hardly go anywhere there was glass flying everywhere all i could 
do was stand and scream 
wagner remained in the bakery during the incident she didnt 
even know it happened until she came out and said thats my car 
waggamon said 
he estimated damage to each store at 2000 with just 100 
worth of damage to the car no charges will be filed

chinas troubled attempt to control the largest 
population on earth will be further disrupted by its political 
turmoil this year a united nations population expert said friday 
there has been quite a bit of slippage in delivery of the 
family planning program since 1985 said aprodicio laquian 
director for china of the un population fund 
he said the slippage will accelerate following the military 
crackdown on prodemocracy dissent in june and there will be a 
significant slowing down in the program 
laquian said chinese officials have become more bureaucratic and 
cautious since then requesting documents in triplicate for matters 
that previously could be handled over the telephone 
he said the new governments stress on central planning has had 
an effect citing the case of a unfunded contraceptive factory 
in the coastal city of tianjin that had to close down because it 
hadnt received a production target from beijing 
they cant buy materials and cant hire laquian said with 
the result that more than 1 million in unsupplied equipment was 
standing idle 
he said some contraceptive factories were working only three 
days a week because the government austerity program has cut them 
off from raw materials and foreign exchange needed for imports used 
in production 
laquian said the problems have not yet changed longterm 
prospects for chinas population which the un predicts will grow 
from more than 11 billion at present to 1285 billion in the year 
2000 
he said the un estimate could be low chinese officials who 
originally hoped to hold the population to 12 billion acknowledge 
it could go as high as 13 billion in 2000 due to missteps in the 
planning program 
laquian said chinas ability to reduce the natural growth rate 
from 24 percent to 14 percent in the past decade has been a 
fantastic accomplishment but he said the program based on the 
onechildperfamily principle has run into serious problems since 
1985 
a major factor in the rise in births in recent years is that the 
360 million people born between 1962 and 1976 have reached 
childbearing age 
among other problems were the success of economic reforms 
giving peasants the money to pay fines for having extra children a 
floating population of up to 50 million migrant workers who are 
more difficult to monitor a more sexually active young population 
and a breakdown in social and health services with the dismantling 
of the communes 
the health system is in disarray and deteriorating since 
1985 because of the lack of a coordinated welfare system laquian 
said barefoot doctors are leaving the profession in droves they 
can earn more raising chickens and pigs 
another shortcoming is the poor quality of contraceptives 
produced in china he said intrauterine devices used by 52 
million women in china have a 10 percent failure rate one reason 
why there were 1268 million abortions last year more than one for 
every two live births 
laquian also pointed to the relaxation of the onechild policy 
since 1985 with some 19 different kinds of exemptions including 
permission for rural families whose first child is a girl to try 
again for a boy 
but he said that eight chinese provinces experimenting with 
twochild policies rather than insisting on one child per couple 
have received more cooperation and obtained better results 
laquian said a fiveyear us boycott on funding for the un 
program because of concern the money would contribute to forced 
abortions has affected the political image of the program but has 
not caused economic hardships 
the organizations budget has risen from 136 million in 1985 
when the united states was the biggest donor with 36 million to 
180 million in 1990 as a result of increased contributions from 
japan and europe 
about 10 million a year goes to china for contraceptive 
production maternal and child health care population research and 
educational programs 
laquian said the chinese government officially opposes forced 
abortion but with 190000 family planning workers and 13 million 
volunteers and pressure from beijing for good results its very 
easy for local party officials to be overzealous 
he said female infanticide among peasants wanting sons appeared 
to be very negligible although there was a tendency for girl 
infants who are regarded as less important than males to be 
neglected in breastfeeding and health care 
laquian said chinas ability to feed onefifth of the worlds 
population has been a great contribution to mankind but that china 
could lose that ability if it has 13 billion mouths to feed at the 
end of the century 100 million more than the original goal 
that would be the first dam to break he said

president bush today formally proclaimed next 
thursday as thanksgiving then bestowed a presidential pardon 
on a noisy 50pound turkey at an annual white house ceremony 
come on this is serious stuff bush said as the squawking 
turkey several times interrupted his rose garden speech marking the 
200th anniversary of thanksgiving proclamations 
this annual observance of thanksgiving was a cherished 
american tradition even before our first president george 
washington issued the first presidential thanksgiving proclamation 
in 1798 said bushs proclamation 
as is the custom bush was presented with a live tom turkey by 
the president of the national turkey federation john wickliffe 
and his wife eleanor from detroit lakes minn 
bush called the turkey our special guest and noted that the 
first familys dog millie who likes to chase squirrels and 
pigeons on the white house grounds has been put upstairs 
he said the gift turkey will not end up on anyones dinner 
table and was being granted a presidential pardon and sent to 
a petting zoo in the washington area 
bush then left the podium to pet the turkey which was standing 
on a table he called two children from the audience to join him in 
petting the bird which was more subdued than it was during his 
remarks 
at a similar ceremony several years ago the turkey lunged at 
thenpresident reagan the following year the turkey was sedated 
this years turkey was not sedated but was presented live and 
kicking said presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater

residents volunteered to give blood at 
hospitals and schools were closed in mourning today after a 
cafeteria wall collapsed in a violent wind killing seven 
elementary schoolchildren 
school and town officials spent most of this morning in private 
meetings about 100 of the 150 town employees met to bring the 
family of this town together said town supervisor robert 
kirkpatrick 
the wall about 30 feet high and 50 feet wide caved in on a 
group of first second and thirdgraders as they were eating 
lunch thursday at the east coldenham elementary school in newburgh 
about 60 miles north of new york city 
the wall was last inspected in 1984 and rotten wood was found 
around some windows valley central school superintendent james 
coonan said today but he said the rotting wood was replaced and 
it was as strong as it could be 
while school was closed today for about 4000 students in the 
district coonan said he was already worrying about next week 
when we have seven funerals to deal with and children sitting 
next to empty seats 
were just overcome by this tragedy said bob kirkpatrick 
supervisor of the town of about 23000 residents 
between 113 to 125 students were eating in the cafeteria when 
the brick cinderblock and glass wall blew in said police chief 
john kulisek the dead and injured children were between 6 and 9 
years old three children were in critical condition today 
kulisek said that witnesses reported a tornado but the national 
weather service said it had no evidence an actual twister was 
responsible for the damage 
firefighters and police arrived at the scene of the disaster 
within 15 minutes and began freeing children trapped under bricks 
and cinder blocks 
a lot of the kids were crushed said robert markisello one 
of the first paramedics at the scene 
mayor donald presutti praised emergency workers saying they 
were treating this like they were members of their own families 
it was a very moving experience 
st lukes hospital spokeswoman debra sgroe said many people 
came to give blood to help victims crisis counselors were meeting 
with parents at the hospital in rooms set aside for families of the 
dead and injured 
police lt john j mahoney said he arrived at the school ten 
minutes after the wall collapsed to find children calling out from 
under the rubble 
some were screaming some were lying there very quiet 
mahoney said you could hear them under the debris calling for 
help calling take me home take me home 
the children were freed from the rubble within half an hour 
children wandered in a daze around the school grounds calling 
for their parents markisello said 
a woman arrived at st lukes shouting i want my daughter i 
want my daughter she later learned her child was not among the 
dead 
one boy who approached the wreckage saw food on some of the 
tables and milk spilled on the floor 
theres two lunch boxes still sitting there 12yearold 
shawn dearborn said 
state education department spokesman christopher carpenter said 
the state would send counselors to help survivors deal with the 
grief 
there are two things we now have to deal with one is the 
physical aspect of getting the children into school the second is 
dealing with the emotional and psychological problems he said 
carpenter said the state would send a structural engineer and an 
architect to the site to help determine why the wall collapsed

easterners should lose their complacency about 
earthquakes because it can happen here rep sherwood boehlert 
rny warned friday 
the san francisco quake brought home to all americans the 
power that such an event can unleash but it may not have shaken us 
from the complacency that views earthquakes as a west coast 
phenomenon boehlert said at a hearing on the hazards of quakes 
east of the rocky mountains 
the most severe earthquakes in the recorded history of the 
united states occurred in the region of new madrid mo in 
18111812 said rep john tanner dtenn 
i dont want this hearing to instill stark terror in the minds 
and hearts of the people who live there tanner said however 
we must take this opportunity to appraise ourselves of that threat 
and begin taking appropriate actions 
funds invested today may be much cheaper than the money needed 
to respond to devastation and destruction in the event of a major 
earthquake in the central united states said tanner 
another great quake in the new madrid area could affect the 
heavily populated region from memphis tenn to st louis mo 
disrupting transportation systems natural gas and electric lines 
and communications and endangering millions of lives tanner said 
in addition quakes in the east cause damage over a much wider 
area than those along the west coast because of differences in the 
earths crust dallas l peck head of the us geological survey 
told the house science subcommittee on investigations 
a repeat of the 19th century quakes in the new madrid area could 
have a devastating impact on residents of missouri arkansas 
mississippi tennessee kentucky indiana and illinois peck said 
and that area is not the only one in the east that faces a 
threat serious tremors have occurred in the past in charleston 
sc boston along the st lawrence river and in several other 
eastern regions 
the geological survey is establishing a network of seismological 
stations in the east to help measure ground movement peck said 
however arch c johnston of memphis state university said funds 
for earthquake research have dwindled in recent years adjusted for 
inflation federal quake spending now is only about 60 percent of 
the 1980 level he said 
johnston said tremors dont occur as often in the eastern states 
as in the west but the threat remains serious because easterners 
are relatively unprepared for the quakes when they do come people 
are unaware of the dangers and there are few building codes 
designed to ensure quake resistant structures he said 
the state of knowledge about the dangers of quakes in the east 
is currently about the same as awareness of the dangers in 
california before the great san francisco quake of 1906 johnston 
said

four police cars rushed in lights flashing 
and officers with guns drawn ordered the suspects out of their car 
three women one nine months pregnant and two children one a 
3yearold boy with a cap pistol 
it was like miami vice kayron foster 31 of salem said 
after the encounter at a us bank branch wednesday i thought 
for a minute that they were going to shoot me 
police who followed and then surrounded her car acted on a 
reliable tip from a bank employee who apparently saw the boys cap 
pistol earlier and feared a robbery might occur said sgt dan cary 
but foster said it was frightening and unnecessary 
they could see the children bouncing around in the back when 
they were following me she said 
cary said it didnt take long for officers to realize that 
jessie myers toting a toy pistol was not a bank robber 
but foster said police continued to treat them as suspects long 
after it was apparent they were no danger to anyone she said she 
was handcuffed and her sister janet easter 20 whose second baby 
was due tuesday was ordered to crawl across the cars gearshift to 
get out of the front seat 
their younger sister diane easter 18 fosters 12yearold 
son trace mills and jessie janet easters son were in the back 
seat 
when they saw a pregnant woman and a child step out they 
should have known she said they are supposed to be trained to 
read people and situations 
foster said she had driven to her bank but realized she had 
forgotten her bank book she drove home to get it and returned to 
the bank 
meanwhile the bank employee had seen the cap pistol and called 
police 
sgt dan smith defended the officers actions saying police 
have no way of knowing what kind of situation they are entering

peace talks between the nicaraguan government 
and the contra rebels recessed for the weekend today after a 
twohour session that participants said failed to narrow 
differences over terms for a cease fire 
the negotiations will resume monday afternoon 
officials from the rival factions met at midmorning following 
four hours of talks thursday that left them looking exhausted and 
disappointed that their efforts apparently had made little headway 
spokesmen for both sides said the principal sticking point was 
the refusal by the contras to agree to a sandinista demand for the 
withdrawal of rebel forces inside nicaragua to base camps in 
honduras 
the sandinistas are linking their consent to a ceasefire to a 
rebel withdrawal while the contras are insisting on maintaining 
their present positions once a truce goes into effect 
one positive sign after the talks recessed was the absence of 
kind of strident criticism of each others position that 
characterized their public comments 24 hours earlier 
cardinal miguel obando y bravo an official witness to the 
discussions left the talks wednesday night to keep an appointment 
elsewhere he said he rejoined the negotiations thursday night on 
orders from the holy see 
after his departure wednesday the atmosphere for the 
discussions deteriorated markedly 
contra spokesman bosco matamoros told reporters he had noted a 
hardening of the governments position on the cease fire 
the chief rebel negotiator col enrique bermudez said the 
sandinistas showed no interest in agreeing to a cease fire as a 
first step in a confidence building process 
his sandinista counterpart vice foreign minister victor hugo 
tinoco said that for a real and effective ceasefire to take 
place the contras should go back to their camps in honduras 
there are an estimated 5000 rebels inside nicaraguan territory 
tinoco seemed mystified about the contra refusal to return to 
honduras noting that ussupplied food and shelter is available 
to them there 
beyond that he said the contras could take their arms with 
them back to honduras and they would reserve the option to return 
with their arms to nicaragua if the peace process falters 
the talks are being mediated by officials from the united 
nations and the organization of american states one official said 
after the 10 pm recess that the negotiations were inching 
along 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega suspended the ceasefire 17 
days ago citing what he said were repeated terrorist activities by 
the contra forces 
reviving the truce is considered an important goal because 
national elections are set for nicaragua on feb 25

senate leaders today called on their 
colleagues to approve a congressonal pay raise plan similar to the 
30000plus increase that just passed the house 
it is a sound reasonable accountable piece of legislation 
said senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine citing ethics 
reforms contained in the house legislation it merits the support 
of every senator 
it doesnt take any courage to vote against a pay raise 
said minority leader bob dole rkan my view is if the voters in 
our states look at what we do if we work hard have a complete 
disclosure of our assets our speaking fees then they can make the 
final judgment 
mitchell and dole made their statements after an unusual caucus 
of both parties behind closed doors on whether to accept the pay 
raise the house approved 252174 thursday for itself and other top 
government officials 
the leaders said the essential elements of the house package 
would remain in the senate proposal including the elimination of 
speech honoraria as a source of outside income for lawmakers 
the house voted to raise its pay and that of government 
executive and federal judges by more than 35 percent in less than 
14 months house salaries would soar from the current 89500 to 
more than 120000 
with the higher pay house members would be barred beginning in 
1991 from pocketing honoraria checks for speeches before interest 
groups they also would be subject to other new rules in the first 
major overhaul of its ethics rules in 12 years 
the house plan doesnt include a raise for the senate unless the 
senate votes to include itself dole and mitchell did not say 
whether their proposal would make it identical 
enemies of the pay raise were trying to turn up the pressure 
against it ralph nader the consumer advocate who helped kill a 
proposed 51 percent pay raise just 10 months ago called the new 
plan a legislative paygrab wolf in a minor ethical reform 
sheeps clothing 
the senate could vote to give itself no raise but let the house 
and others get theirs or it could buy into the whole deal kill it 
or choose something in between 
the leadership is pushing hard for us to adopt the house 
package sen bob packwood rore said thursday apparently 
it must be a close vote 
mitchell has said he favored the house plan but speculated the 
senate might go for a more modest pay package and a more gradual 
elimination of honoraria 
senators now may keep speaking fees equal to 40 percent of their 
salaries compared to 30 percent in the house so the house plan 
actually could be an income cut for some senators the senate also 
has its own ideas about ethics rules including restrictions on 
lobbying after lawmakers leave office 
the house plan would raise salaries in a series of steps for a 
total minimum 35 percent raise by jan 1 1991 on top of that 
lawmakers and the other officials would get whatever costofliving 
adjustment is given to rankandfile government workers on that 
date 
president bush eager to raise pay for his top staff and the 
federal judges has already said he would sign the bill 
house members who took the politically unpopular plunge and 
voted for the pay raise thursday were watching the senates moves 
carefully for fear the other chamber would kill it 
the senate in the next 24 hours needs to think about what is 
politically possible said rep vic fazio dcalif cochairman 
of the task force that drafted the house plan 
another house democrat said the pressure his chamber would put 
on the senate would approach white heat 
in a similar situation seven years ago the senate let the house 
scoot ahead in salary but senators reconsidered six months later 
and gave themselves a catchup raise 
besides the ban on keeping honoraria the house bill includes a 
broad range of changes in its rules and in federal ethics law 
outside earnings besides honoraria would be limited to 15 
percent of salary and severely restricted in scope rules governing 
the acceptance of gifts and travel from people outside the 
immediate family would be tightened 
the rules also would require more detailed disclosure of 
personal assets 
the most recent congressional pay raise was in 1987 and it 
hasnt been raised since then primarily because members fear the 
political consequences

a propane fire shot flames at least 100 feet 
into the air and prompted the evacuation of about 500 people before 
it was put out late this morning 
no injuries were reported in the blaze which began thursday 
morning lighting up the southwest missouri sky and visible at 
least 25 miles away 
charlotte coates a jasper emergency services dispatcher 
estimated that 500 people from the town of 1100 had to leave their 
homes overnight 
i would say the flames are 100 to 150 feet in the air she 
said at the height of the fire you can see it from all over 
its like in the movies 
the fire at a williams pipe line co terminal about two miles 
south of jasper fed on a 17acre underground storage cavern 
burning propane at the rate of 300 gallons an hour said ray 
pullen a williams official 
jim gipson a company spokesman said the cavern fire was 
extinguished late this morning but some small fires remained from 
nearby pipeline valves 
kenneth graham a williams executive from houston arrived early 
today to coordinate the effort to put out the fire said judy 
johnson civil defense director for joplin and jasper county 
about 20 tanker loads of water were trucked in during the night 
highway 71 which runs north and south through the middle of 
jasper was closed in both directions the jasper county sheriffs 
department said a rail line was closed and aircraft were warned 
not to fly in the area 
evacuated residents were asked to go to nearby carthage and 
lamar and williams bused some people to hotels in joplin about 10 
miles south of jasper 
the fire started as a work crew was performing routine 
maintenance on a pump said gipson propane escaped and somehow 
ignited when it reached the surface gipson said 
an attempt was made thursday to stop the fire by injecting 2000 
gallons of water into the cavern but the gas erupted again to 
shoot flames 200 feet into the sky 
officials then decided to order the evacuation and let the fire 
burn through the night until graham and other company fire control 
experts arrived

the us ambassador said today 
he will personally investigate the brutal massacre of six jesuit 
priests and he offered protection to any witnesses who come 
forward to testify 
hours after the killings thursday uniformed security officers 
raided a lutheran church office and arrested 12 missionary workers 
including four americans a canadian consular official said 
also today sporadic fighting was reported six days after 
leftist rebels launched their biggest offensive in a 10yearold 
civil war a british journalist was wounded in crossfire between 
rebels and government troops in the mejicanos district of san 
salvador and later died in a hospital 
us ambassador william walker said the united states is 
pressuring the rightwing government of president alfredo cristiani 
to investigate the killings of the six jesuit priests their cook 
and her daughter 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
the united states would closely monitor the salvadoran governments 
investigation of the killings but did not plan to assist in the 
inquiry 
walker however offered protection to citizens providing 
information he also said in an interview i will try to find and 
solicit the testimony of people who are or who claim to be 
witnesses 
he said he planned to contact officials at the jesuit university 
who have said two witnesses saw about 30 men in army uniforms enter 
the priests residence just before the shooting began 
he described the massacre as a blot on the image of el 
salvadors government that could only be erased by a full 
investigation and punishment of the guilty 
the government which relies heavily on us aid denied 
responsibility and said the murders were savage and irrational 
the rev jose maria tojeira the jesuit provincial for central 
america said the victims were tortured before they were slain 
although the bodies were found mutilated the torture allegations 
have not been confirmed 
tojeira said terrified witnesses had gone into hiding and did 
not trust authorities because troops were implicated in the 
killings 
el salvador only recently emerged from a period of repression 
during which death squads and rightist elements of the military 
were accused of killing thousands of people the salvadoran right 
considers church activists and church intellectuals to be 
subversives 
an annual reported presented today at the united nations said 
accused el salvadors government of presiding over a resurgence 
of torture this year and a crackdown on trade unions and 
organizations 
the annual report by jose antonio pastor ridruejo a special 
representative of the un commission on human rights criticized 
both the government and rebels for kidnappings and assassinations 
cristiani who took office june 1 told reporters thursday the 
government was not involved in the priest slayings and that he had 
ordered an investigation the killers will jeopardize further the 
critical situation in our country he said 
the guerrillas of the leftist farabundo marti national 
liberation front who have been waging a 10yearold war with the 
government called the slayings an absurd massacre 
uniformed security officers on thursday raided a downtown office 
of the lutheran church and arrested 12 missionary workers said 
michel gagne a consular officer at the canadian embassy 
he said they were being detained at treasury police 
headquarters police refused to confirm the report 
the detainees included four us citizens a canadian and a 
spaniard the rest were west germans 
the americans were identified as paula brentlinger a physician 
from seattle thomas gabriel a nurse from seattle bradley fields 
a social worker from san diego and paul fitch a us volunteer 
whose hometown was not known 
the rev william dexheimer a pastor of the evangelical lutheran 
church of america said he had received a telephone call tuesday 
threatening him with death if he didnt leave after the slayings 
thursday he flew home to florida 
at the vatican pope john paul ii today decried the murder of 
the jesuits calling it an act of abominable violence in a 
telegram to the archbishop of san salvador monsignor arturo rivera 
damas 
rivera damas compared the killings to the slaying of his 
predecessor oscar arnulfo romero in march 1980 romero had been 
denouncing years of killings by rightwing death squads and 
kidnappings by guerrillas 
on dec 2 1980 troops killed us maryknoll nuns ita ford and 
maura clarke ursuline sister dorothy kazel and lay worker jean 
donovan 
more than 800 people have died and twice as many have been 
wounded since government forces and the guerrillas began fighting 
saturday according to reports by the military and hospitals 
michael blundy 44 a correspondent for a british newspaper the 
sunday correspondent died at rosales hospital where he had been 
rushed by fellow reporters after he was shot in the shoulder today 
british viceconsul adele taylor said blundys body will be sent to 
london for burial 
col rene emilio ponce the armed forces chief of staff late 
thursday appealed to people to return to work but a dusktodawn 
curfew a state of siege declared by the government and a ban on 
traffic decreed by the rebels made it seem doubtful many would heed 
his call 
the guerrillas are estimated to have 7000 fulltime fighters 
and 11000 backups nationwide the guerrillas are heavily 
outnumbered by the 56000strong salvadoran army and other security 
forces

the air force is defending its purchase of 173 
custommade facsimile machines under contracts that amount to 73 
million contending friday they are not your normal fax and 
are designed to withstand the dirt havoc and extremes of 
battlefield duty 
the service was inundated with queries about the machines after 
a published report said they cost the air force 421000 apiece a 
figure computed by dividing the 73 million cost by 173 
air force spokesman maj lou figueroa disputed the figure 
saying the service was paying 76000 for each unit 
he said the machines were being purchased from litton industries 
under a contract for 33 million and that an additional contract 
for some 40 million covers a very extensive list of diagnostic 
equipment laser assemblies and other items such as power 
supplies training for use of the units and the paper which 
costs 100 a roll 
figueroa said the high cost of paper was due to the fact that it 
came in 400foot rolls and is specially coated to handle the 
highresolution images the machine is designed to transmit 
the spokesman said the custommade units were ordered to 
withstand the rigors of the battlefield and to be used under a 
variety of conditions that might be encountered in wartime 
this isnt just a normal fax that sits in your office and does 
its thing figueroa said these are not machines made to sit in 
a wing commanders office they are designed to be deployed off a 
dirt runway he said 
he said the machines which weigh about 115 pounds and are the 
size of a small compact television are built to transmit 
sensitive intelligence data over a variety of phone lines 
the data can be transmitted in what is called in military jargon 
as near real time which means almost instantaneously he said 
we are talking about a machine that is capable of allowing a 
commander in a battle field situation who is managing fighter 
aircraft to get transmissions from satellites to tell him what 
targets are out there that need to be taken out figueroa said 
the average fax machine in an office would not be sufficient 
for such a task the spokesman said 
we are talking wartime conditions we are talking about 
targets that may or may not be camouflagued we need high quality 
resolution for this type of imagery he said 
figueroa said the unit was ordered so that it could operate 
anywhere in the world at any time and with a variety of power 
sources such as batteries power generators or commercial power 
sources from around the world 
it is able to withstand dust rain sand and salt work in 
temperatures from minus 25 degress to 125 degrees fahrenheit and 
work over public telephone lines as well as the military phone 
lines protect sensitive information from electronic eavesdroppers

here is the text of president bushs 
thanksgiving day proclamation issued friday 
on thanksgiving day we americans pause as a nation to give 
thanks for the freedom and prosperity with which we have been 
blessed by our creator like the pilgrims who first settled in this 
land we offer praise to god for his goodness and generosity and 
rededicate ourselves to lives of service and virtue in his sight 
this annual observance of thanksgiving was a cherished american 
tradition even before our first president george washington 
issued the first presidential thanksgiving proclamation in 1789 
in his first inaugural address president washington observed 
that no people can be bound to acknowledge and adore the 
invisible hand which conducts the affairs of men more than those of 
the united states he noted that the american people blessed 
with victory in their fight for independence and with an abundance 
of crops in their fields owed god some return of pious 
gratitude 
later in a confidential note to his close adviser james 
madison he asked should the sense of the senate be taken on 
a day of thanksgiving 
george washington thus led the way to a joint resolution of 
congress requesting the president to set aside a day of public 
thanksgiving and prayer to be observed by acknowledging with 
grateful hearts the many and signal favors of almighty god 
through the eloquent words of president washingtons initial 
thanksgiving proclamation the first under the constitution we 
are reminded of our dependence upon our heavenly father and of the 
debt of gratitude we owe to him 
it is the duty of all nations wrote washington to 
acknowledge the providence of almighty god to obey his will to be 
grateful for his benefits and humbly to implore his protection and 
favor 
president washington asked that on thanksgiving day the people 
of the united states 
unite in rendering unto god our sincere and humble thanks 
for his kind care and protection of the people of this country 
previous to their becoming a nation for the great degree of 
tranquility union and plenty which we have since enjoyed for 
the civil and religious liberty with which we are blessed and 
for all the great and various favors which he hath been pleased to 
confer upon us 
two hundred years later we continue to offer thanks to the 
almighty not only for the material prosperity that our nation 
enjoys but also for the blessings of peace and freedom our nation 
has no greater treasure than these 
as we pause to acknowledge the kindnesses god has shown to us 
and indeed his gift of life itself we do so in a spirit of 
humility as well as gratitude when the united states was still a 
fledgling democracy president washington asked the american people 
to unite in prayer to the great lord and ruler of nations in 
order to 
beseech him to pardon our national and other transgressions 
to enable us all whether in public or private stations to perform 
our several and relative duties properly and punctually to render 
our national government a blessing to all the people by constantly 
being a government of wise just and constitutional laws 
discreetly and faithfully executed and obeyed to protect and guide 
all sovereigns and nationsand to bless them with good 
government peace and concord 
today we too pause on thanksgiving with humble and contrite 
hearts mindful of gods mercy and forgiveness and of our continued 
need for his protection and guidance 
on this day we also remember that one gives praise to god not 
only through prayers of thanksgiving but also through obedience to 
his commandments and service to others especially those less 
fortunate than ourselves 
while some presidents followed washingtons precedent and some 
state governors did as well president lincoln despite being 
faced with the dark specter of civil war renewed the practice of 
proclaiming a national day of thanksgiving this venerable 
tradition has been sustained by every president since then in 
times of strife as well as times of peace and prosperity 
today we continue to offer thanks and praise to our creator 
that great author of every public and private good for the 
many blessings he has bestowed upon us in so doing we recall the 
timeless words of the 100th psalm 
serve the lord with gladness come before his presence with 
singing 
know ye that the lord he is god it is he that hath made us 
and not we ourselves we are his people and the sheep of his 
pasture 
enter into his gates with thanksgiving and into his courts 
with praise be thankful unto him and bless his name 
for the lord is good his mercy is everlasting and his truth 
endureth to all generations 
now therefore i george bush president of the united states 
of america do hereby proclaim thursday november 23 1989 as a 
national day of thanksgiving and i call upon the american people 
to gather together in homes and places of worship on that day of 
thanks to affirm by their prayers and their gratitude the many 
blessings god has bestowed upon us and our nation 
in witness whereof i have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth 
day of november in the year of our lord nineteen hundred and 
eightynine and of the independence of the united states of 
america the two hundred and fourteenth

a secret plan allowing the cia to encourage a 
coup against panamas manuel antonio noriega was approved by the 
administration despite congressional objections to overthrowing 
foreign leaders without a clear threat to us security 
intelligence sources said friday 
the plan was presented about three weeks ago to congressional 
overseers in a presidential legal document known as a finding 
the sources said 
house intelligence committee chairman anthony beilenson 
dcalif and two others on the 19member panel matthew mchugh 
dny and robert kastenmeier dwis responded with a letter of 
objection to president bush said government sources who spoke only 
on condition of anonymity 
when a president tells congress of such a plan and presents a 
legal finding lawmakers have no direct power to deny him though 
members can make whatever case they see as appropriate if they 
disagree 
neither beilenson nor mchugh would comment on the letter friday 
calls to kastenmeiers office seeking comment were not immediately 
returned 
some officials suggested privately that the us government 
might not have been upset to see the covert plan publicly leaked 
asked about it on thursday bush said he would neither confirm nor

a un envoy trying to restart the peace 
talks between iran and iraq failed to break the deadlock but 
scheduled more meetings next month iranian media said friday 
jan eliasson ended his 17day shuttle and left tehran for new 
york the islamic republic news agency said and iranian president 
hashemi rafsanjani blamed the missions failure on iraq 
rafsanjani said iraq was still not ready to accept un 
resolution 598 a plan aimed at reaching a peace accord between the 
two counties that ended eight years of fighting nearly 16 months 
ago 
irna monitored in cyprus quoted eliasson as saying he arranged 
for separate meetings between the foreign ministers of the two 
countries and un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar in new 
york next month 
not surprisingly the positions of iran and iraq are in some 
respects wide apart he told the news agency he declined to 
elaborate 
eliasson said iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz and his iranian 
counterpart ali akbar velayati would meet separately with perez 
de cuellar 
in a statement released in iran and iraq on thursday eliasson 
said he had 12 meetings with officials of both countries focusing 
on how to implement un security council resolution 598 
in the course of my talks with the representatives of both 
governments i suggested ways to move the talks forward within the 
framework of resolution 598 in order to achieve a comprehensive and 
lasting peace in the region he said 
the resolution which halted the eightyear war on aug 20 
1988 calls for troop withdrawals to internationally recognized 
borders the exchange of prisoners of war and a settlement of the 
conflict through unsponsored negotiations 
rafsanjani in a friday prayer sermon said iraqs insistence 
that a release of prisoners of war should come before other parts 
of resolution 598 was a mere excuse by baghdad for failing to 
carry out the resolution 
the iranians want the resolution to be followed pointbypoint 
in the order listed in the document insisting the first step 
should be an iraqi withdrawal from iranian territory they seized in 
the final weeks of the war 
the exchange of pows should come next followed by clearing war 
debris from the shattalarab waterway iraqs main outlet to the 
gulf 
obviously both sides are against the resumption of the war 
under any circumstances rafsanjani said 
but he stressed that iranians should remain vigilant we have 
to preserve our combat readiness 
among the sticking points in the talks has been iraqs claim on 
the shattalarab waterway which formed part of the frontier 
between the two nations before the war the iraqis want the border 
redrawn to include all of the strategic waterway in iraqi territory 
an estimated 100000 pows are held by both sides and iraq has 
offered that they be swapped outside the framework of the 
resolution iran refused insisting on an iraqi withdrawal first

the transplant of a heart to a palestinian from 
an israeli soldier killed by arab guerrillas has angered rightwing 
israelis who called it a reward for violence 
the arabs cut out our hearts literally and we give them ours 
were outraged that the murder of jews means so little in the 
jewish land said shifra hoffman who represents a group of 
victims of palestinian guerrilla attacks and their families 
the heart recipient hanna khader 54 of the arab sector of 
east jerusalem was in stable condition friday at hadassah hospital 
in jerusalem 
the donor sgt zeev traum 40 was buried friday in yodfat a 
collective farm the army said 
traum an army reservist died wednesday of a head wound 
suffered when arab guerrillas attacked his jeep with automatic 
gunfire in the occupied gaza strip 
his heart was flown by army helicopter from soroka hospital in 
beersheba to hadassah hospital and the fourhour transplant was 
immediately performed 
it was the first known case since the start of the palestinian 
uprising of an israeli donating an organ to a palestinian 
a group calling itself victims of arab terror said the 
transplant shows cooperation between people of culture and 
gangs 
the transplant also was criticized by yoel israeli whose 
brother yehiel died in december after the family of a palestinian 
shot to death by an israeli soldier refused to donate the heart 
where were all the arabs when we looked for heart we came 
with a humanitarian request and offered the family a large sum of 
money we were almost killed there they refused for political 
and nationalist reasons he told the weekly yerushalaim newspaper 
ultraorthodox jewish rabbi yeshayahu scheinberg supported 
israeli telling the daily maariv that as long as the arabs dont 
donate to jews there is no need to donate to them especially when 
we talk of a fallen soldier who died glorifying gods name 
traum was the 42nd israeli killed in the 23monthold 
palestinian uprising against israeli rule of the gaza strip and 
west bank at least 615 palestinians have died of israeli gunfire 
in the rebellion 
only one arabic newspaper mentioned the operation and 
palestinian reaction was mixed 
ali jadeh a palestinian who spent 16 years in jail for security 
offenses said the story should have been published to show the 
human side of israelis 
but he also said israeli authorities were exploiting the issue 
they are not making it public as an example for arabs and jews to 
follow but want to say that israelis are human and palestinians 
are savage he alleged 
controversy also erupted over publication of the names of those 
involved in the transplant operation 
the khader family said they were concerned palestinian 
extremists would attack them for accepting the heart 
our policy is not to reveal the names of the donors 
haddassah hospital spokeswoman ruth mekel said we hope it wont 
harm transplants in the future 
chaim reuveni director of soroka hospital where traum died 
said doctors had promised traums wife brenda of baltimore that 
her husbands identity would be kept secret he said the hospital 
would no longer participate in transplants until there was a law 
guaranteeing donor anonymity 
the director of the health ministry dr moshe mashiah told 
israel radio there is no legal means to prevent publication of the 
name of a donor or recipient 
i fear very much that as a result of what happened we will 
have to look for a way to protect these wishes by law mashiah

a dogged entrepreneur has produced a 
hightech solution for canine owners who feel guilty leaving their 
pets at home alone a videotape to entertain housebound hounds 
doggie adventure a 25minute video for the wetnosed set 
is designed to stimulate fido not turn him into a couch canine 
filmed from a poochs perspective the tape portrays a nonstop 
romp through city streets parks and a barnyard teeming with 
animals its creator hopes that dogs will sniff howl and slobber 
along 
the vcr still must be turned on by humans or activated by a 
timer 
writing and producing a video geared for dogs just seemed 
natural to harley toberman a minneapolis businessman who says his 
recently deceased dog miss piggy was responsible for the project 
the halfterrier halfdachshund mongrel doesnt appear in the film 
but her bark is featured on the soundtrack 
shes just been such a part of my life toberman said in an 
interview last week i guess this tape we put together is 
basically a biography of her 
toberman 44 said he is talking to some national retail outlets 
to try to bring the 1495 tape to stores by christmas meanwhile 
its available by mail order 
toberman who runs a twin cities recording studio said the idea 
came to him after an outing with miss piggy to a friends farm two 
years ago the cows sent the dog into a frenzy and toberman filmed 
the scene with his portable camera 
every time she saw that tape shed start barking furiously 
he said 
guilt also played a role in the videotapes creation 
many times when wed go out and do something and wed tell 
her she had to stay shed have a real sad look on her face said 
toberman it broke your heart 
filmed on location in minneapolis and hinckley minn during 
the dog days of august natch the tape cost about 15000 to 
produce 
stereophonic sound gives canine viewers an earful a collar 
jangles grass crunches underfoot er underpaw and water is 
slurped up from a dish the crunch of dog biscuits adds to the 
ambiance 
toberman says a pet therapist recommended recording a variety of 
sounds to keep the dogs attention the therapist also suggested 
that the pet owner turn the volume up louder than normal to give 
the dog more of a sensation of being there 
technical problems were numerous said toberman most notably a 
scene that entailed taking the camera through pig slop 
it was really grueling stuff especially in august he said 
the video has been tested already on a few neighborhood dogs 
and according to toberman nearly all gave it a pawsup rating 
these dogs would walk right up to the tv and put their nose 
right up to the tube and just stare at it he said it was 
uncanny 
added his wife kim they dont get to fall asleep thats it 
they may be distracted for a moment but they always come back 
toberman realizes his video must appeal to human eyes as well 
so he made the tape in color dogs see only in black and white 
a cat video hasnt been ruled out but toberman said it might be 
less effective because cats have a shorter attention span 
however the entrepreneur is confident enough of doggie 
adventure to be planning a longer sequel

relationship with a male prostitute will continue over the yearend 
congressional recess an official involved in the probe said friday 
the house ethics committee has no meetings scheduled at present 
but committee staff will continue working on the frank case said 
mark davis a staff member 
its still open and ongoing davis said the adjournment 
of congress has no impact on what the staff does or will be doing 
the ethics panel initially hoped to complete its investigation 
of frank dmass by the end of the year davis had no comment on 
a report in the washington times that the investigation was being 
extended while members await publication of a magazine article 
about frank 
the newspaper reported friday that members want to see what male 
prostitute stephen gobie told penthouse magazine in an interview 
expected to be appear in the february issue 
penthouse spokeswoman leslie jay said the february issue is 
slated to be published jan 2 but that no decision has been made on 
whether the frank article will appear in that issue 
frank spokesman doug cahn said the question of timing of the 
ethics committee is not a question for barney frank barney is 
cooperating with the ethics committee 
frank who is homosexual has admitted paying gobie 80 for sex 
in 1985 and subsequently hiring him with personal money to serve as 
a housekeeper and driver from july 1985 through august 1987 
gobie made public the relationship in august and claimed the 
congressman knew he was running a prostitution ring from franks 
capitol hill apartment gobie also accused frank of engaging in sex 
with him in the house gymnasium frank has denied the charges

maines attorney general said friday his 
office knows of no way the state could legally force an end to 
cruise missile test flights over the state an action approved by 
voters 
the results of the nonbinding referendum on nov 7 prompted 
gov john r mckernan to send letters to federal and congressional 
officials urging them to recognize this opposition and reassess 
the need for test flights of the unarmed missiles over maine 
maine is one of five states where tomahawk missiles are flown by 
the navy missiles are launched from submarines off the coast and 
fly at 500 to 6000 feet above the ground to the navy survival 
school at rangeley 
there have been three tests over maine 
state attorney general james e tierney releasing a letter to 
mckernan said that under the supremacy clause in article vi of the 
us constitution the states are without constitutional power to 
interfere with such actions 
but tierney also said the states inability to take legal action 
against the federal government over the tests was undoubtedly in 
the minds of advocates of the ban because their resolution 
specifically called on the governor to intervene with the federal 
government to stop the testing 
tierney said mckernans letterwriting appears to be clearly 
what was contemplated by the resolution and satisfies your legal 
obligation under it 
consequently tierney said the department urges you to 
continue to pursue that course in the hope that through such 
forceful advocacy the views of the citizens of maine on the matter 
may prevail 
eric johnson campaign manager for proponents of the 
antitesting measure did not respond immediately friday to a 
telephone request for comment on tierneys letter 
the deputy director of public affairs for the navy project said 
friday there had been no change in status 
yes we are going to continue to go with our plans as always 
until were ordered to do otherwise susan boyd said in a 
telephone interview from project headquarters outside washington 
boyd would not comment on details of future tests saying 
planned flight dates are kept secret 
in unofficial tallies of the nov 7 balloting the issue was 
approved by 52 percent of the voters opponents of the testing had 
presented 66142 valid signatures to force their advisory question 
onto the ballot

pardon friday on a noisy 50pound turkey whose gobbles punctuated 
a rose garden speech declaring next thursday as thanksgiving 
come on this is serious stuff bush scolded the turkey 
unlike the bird that lunged at president reagan several years 
ago this years turkey quieted and bobbed his head calmly as bush 
left the podium to stroke its back 
bush was presented the 28weekold turkey at a ceremony marking 
the 200th anniversary of presidential thanksgiving proclamations 
before signing this years proclamation bush observed two 
hundred years ago george washington signed the original 
proclamation for a day of thanksgiving a day of thanks for the 
bounty we enjoy 
from that point bush continued haltingly as both the turkeys 
gobbles and the crowds laughter rose in volume 
bush told his audience which included a group of 30 elementary 
school children our special guest seems understandably 
nervous 
but let me assure you and this fine tom turkey that he will 
not end up on anyones dinner table not this guy hes granted a 
presidential pardon as of right now 
bush said the turkey would live out his days on a childrens 
petting zoo in the area 
the turkey was raised in detroit lakes minn by john 
wickliffe the president of the national turkey federation and his 
wife eleanor 
wickliffe told bush the turkey weighs 50 pounds one for every 
state in the union 
the federation said in a fact sheet that this years white 
house turkey notwithstanding americans next thursday will consume 
45 million turkeys 
the president said that the family dog millie who loves to 
chase squirrels and pigeons on the white house grounds had been 
dispatched upstairs looking wistfully out of the window im 
sure 
bush called two children from the audience third grader 
shannon duffy 8 and fifth grader danny benyam 10 both from 
brenmar park elementary school in fairfax county va to join him 
in petting the turkey 
at a similar ceremony several years ago the turkey lunged at 
and startled reagan the following year the turkey was sedated 
this years turkey was not sedated but was presented live and 
kicking said presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
a bit later addressing an arts ceremony bush said ive been 
out there trying to calm the national turkey it all worked out 
pretty well 
the tradition of presenting a live turkey to the president goes 
back 42 years to the administration of president truman

lizard love can be helped along by a few 
months in the fridge a zoo official says 
wichitas sedgewick county zoo and the oklahoma city zoo are two 
of the few zoos in the nation that have successfully hatched gila 
monsters in captivity said eric rundquist a herpetologist 
formerly with the oklahoma zoo and now with the wichita zoo 
the trick is making the gila monsters think they have 
hibernated he said which is accomplished by putting the lizards 
in a refrigerator the zoos six adult gila monsters went in a 
large commercial refrigerator in december and were taken out in 
march after hibernation the warmer temperatures stimulated the 
males sperm production the lizards bred in may 
two months later the zoos three females laid 13 eggs about 
half of which turned out to be fertile 
the six baby gilas hatched earlier this month go on display this

senate leaders agreed friday to send back to 
president bush the nomination of james cason for a top natural 
resources job and ask that someone else be selected 
it was the first time since the vote against john tower for 
defense secretary earlier this year that a nomination got as far as 
the senate floor only to be turned back 
it will mark the first time that any assistant secretary 
nominee would be defeated after being reported out of committee 
with a favorable recommendation said republican leader bob dole 
of kansas 
cason a highranking official at the interior department since 
1982 was nominated to be assistant secretary of agriculture for 
natural resources and soil conservation 
after two days of hearings the agriculture committee voted 127 
to send the nomination to senate floor despite vocal opposition 
from committee chairman sen patrick leahy dvt and some other 
committee members 
cason was strongly opposed by environmentalists because they 
said he showed a preference at interior for private development 
over environmental concerns 
sen harry reid dnev called cason a james watt clone in 
reference to the former interior secretary who favored development 
of government land 
dole expressed disappointment at the mounting opposition saying 
a campaign of distortion has successfully poisoned the debate 
a cheap way to get a good environmental vote is to vote down 
this nominee whether he deserves it or not said dole i can 
see the handwriting on the wall 
after conferring with agriculture secretary clayton yeutter and 
the white house dole requested that the senate not act on the 
nomination 
leahy said friday the nominee would have been defeated by a 
20vote margin with opponents including more than five 
republicans if a vote had been taken 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine agreed to send the 
nomination back to bush with a strong urging that this nominee 
not be made the subject of a recess appointment or that he be 
resubmitted when congress comes back in january 
im sure theyre practical realists said leahy im sure 
they wont send the name back up here

the house armed services committee said friday 
it will hold hearings next month on the navys inquiry and 
subsequent finding that a troubled sailor apparently caused the 
fatal explosion aboard the uss iowa 
we have unearthed significant new evidence that casts new 
light on the navys conclusion that gunners mate clayton hartwig 
committed suicide and mass murder in the gun turret rep 
nicholas mavroules chairman of the armed services subcommittee on 
investigations said in a statement 
mavroules said his panel has been reviewing several aspects of 
the navy investigation especially its technical competence and 
its psychological analysis 
questioned later about his comments mavroules declined to 
provide specifics but expressed concern about a question of 
interpretation of the evidence 
the massachusetts democrat has said he seriously questioned 
the navys report and cited an fbi report that said its laboratory 
investigation on the incident was inconclusive 
i want documentation mavroules said in an interview 
unless the navy does that its a discredit to the investigation 
the investigation was thorough but the conclusion was not 
thorough 
congressional sources who requested anonymity said the new 
evidence centers on the fbis psychological analysis of hartwig and 
the forensic evidence compiled by the fbi and the navy 
the house hearings scheduled for dec 12 and 13 will include 
witnesses from the navy and fbi mavroules said 
lets get it all out on the table he said 
the house announcement of hearings came one day after the senate 
amed services committee held the first in a series of hearings on 
the iowa incident 
navy officials on thursday defended their conclusion that the 
april 19 blast in gun turret no 2 was most likely caused by 
hartwig who had the responsibility of inserting the detonator into 
one the battleships 16inch guns 
hartwig and 46 shipmates died in the explosion on the world war 
iiera battleship 
rear adm richard milligan who oversaw the navys technical and 
criminal investigation into the blast testified thursday that 
additional technical tests conducted since he issued his report 
sept 7 found unique foreign material on the projectile from 
the exploding gun barrel that would not have been present during a 
normal firing 
the new tests identified the material as iron wires coated with 
calcium chlorine and oxygen which would be produced by some 
types of nonelectronic explosive devices milligan said in his 
statement 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee said in a statement that the navys conclusion is based

chancellor helmut kohl appealed friday 
for the trust of all our neighbors in dealings with beleaguered 
east germany 
speaking to the bonn diplomatic corps on the eve of a european 
community summit of western european leaders in paris kohl also 
called for help in making sure east german reforms do not collapse 
kohl said he realizes anxious questions are being put to the 
germans as east germany heads into an uncertain future among 
them the question of prospects for german reunification 
our countrymen in the german democratic republic east 
germany must be able to state clearly which course they want to 
take whatever their decision is we will respect it kohl said 
we need the trust of all our neighbors in east and west on 
this question 
he sought to allay any fears that prospects of evercloser 
relations with struggling east germany could result in the rebirth 
of german nationalism 
this is not the birth of a new german nationalism as some 
suspect kohl said 
kohl said west germany will be consulting with east german 
leaders about what kinds of financial assistance bonn might provide 
to help support east germanys sputtering economy 
helping the reform process in east germany poland and hungary 
should be the concern for all europeans kohl said 
there has been concern among some west europeans that events in 
east germany might sidetrack the european communitys moves to 
strengthen itself by creating a single barrierfree market in late 
1992 
but kohl pledged west germany will continue its efforts in 
close cooperation with france and all other european partners to 
enhance european integration 
us ambassador vernon a walters who attended the diplomatic 
corps reception said the united states would not be averse to 
german reunification if thats what the east germans choose but he 
stressed that others view on the matter are also important to 
consider including the soviet unions 
walters said president bush has said very clearly the united 
states has no problem with this providing it can be done 
peacefully which means with some sort of consent from the soviets 
and through the free choice of the people walters said 
after all they have 16 divisions stationed in eastern 
germany he said

the state department on friday praised an 
organization of american states resolution calling for early 
elections in panama and condemning the serious violations of 
human rights occurring there 
the resolution was approved 25 to 2 shortly before midnight 
thursday by the oas general assembly only panama and nicaragua 
voted in opposition 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the 
resolution repudiates and isolates the government of panamas 
gen manuel antonio noriega and is the strongest oas statement to 
date on that issue 
at a separate news conference the new us ambassador to the 
oas luigi einaudi expressed regret that the resolution did not 
mention noriega by name but added that the isolation of the 
panamanian leader is now visible for everyone to see 
the bush administration which considers the noriegaled 
government to be illigitimate was pleased that at no point in the 
resolution was there any reference to the panamanian government 
ms tutwiler said the resolution deprives noriega of any 
pretext of legitimacy we applaud the firm stand taken by the 
organization of american states which can only serve to encourage 
a return to democracy for the people of panama support for human 
rights and an end to the brutal noriega dictatorship

burroughs wellcome co is 
seeking federal approval to market its antiaids drug azt to 
people who have the aids virus but do not yet show signs of the 
disease the company said friday 
permission for wider sales is being sought from the food and 
drug administration after clinical studies released in august 
showed that azt slows the onset of aids in people infected with the 
virus said company spokeswoman kathy bartlett 
fda approval for broader use would greatly expand demand for the 
drug by extending it to several thousand hivinfected people she 
said 
azt the only fdaapproved drug for treatment of aids in the 
united states can be used now only on patients who show symptoms 
of aids and those who are critically ill 
officials said there was no timetable for when the fda might 
approve the request 
meanwhile wellcome plc the british parent company of burroughs 
wellcome in london reported dramatic increases in sales of azt 
also known as azidothymidne or retrovir up 49 percent to 225 
million 
in september north carolinabased burroughs wellcome announced 
a 20 percent price cut that effectively reduced the drugs retail 
price from 8000 per year per patient to 6400 
but ms bartlett said there are no plans for another price cut 
even if use of the drug is extended 
aids activists have criticized wellcome for reaping huge profits 
from azt but the company has never disclosed financial results 
from the drug 
our research work with this drug is by no means over and it 
will continue to absorb substantial research and development 
resources the company said in a statement thursday 
in the past year wellcome spent 3175 million on research and 
development about 36 percent of the researchanddevelopment 
budget was spent on antiviral drugs such as azt up from 31 percent 
in the previous year 
wellcome plc reported thursday it had posted sales of 24 
billion in the year ended aug 26 up from 22 billion the 
previous year the company reported net income of 2792 million 
or 33 cents per share up from 2237 million or 27 cents per

a national english teachers group on friday 
gave its doublespeak award to exxon corp for calling some 35 
miles of alaskan beaches environmentally stable after an oil 
spill cleanup earlier this year 
william lutz of rutgers university told a convention of the 
national council of teachers of english that the committee on 
public doublespeak selected exxon the winner from among 18 nominees 
officials of the george bush presidential campaign received 
second place lutz said for claiming that they disapproved of 
the famous willie horton commercial while they did little to stop 
it 
third place went to former interior secretary james watt who 
was paid a 300000 consulting fee for making eight phone calls 
to samuel pierce then secretary of housing and urban development 
and for one 30minute meeting with pierce lutz said 
lutz said the annual doublespeak award calls attention to 
conspicuous examples of public language that in the committees 
view are deceptive evasive euphemistic confusing or 
selfcontradictory and have the potential for pernicious social 
or political consequences the committee bases its awards on news 
reports 
lutz said exxon claimed it had cleaned some 35 miles of alaskan 
beaches where the supertanker exxon valdez ran aground in late 
march and then declared them environmentally clean and 
environmentally stabilized 
lutz pointed to various news reports on the visible presence of 
oil along the coast in the area he said that after exxon was 
challenged by the news media it no longer refers to the beaches 
as being cleaned but as being treated 
exxon spokesman bill smith had this response i think the 
people who made this award should be aware that 12000 men and 
women worked throughout the summer in difficult and dangerous 
conditions to treat and clean the beaches of prince william sound 
and that the coast guard officer with responsibility for the 
cleanup has said that no company or government could have done a 
better job than exxon 
the bush campaign lutz said used commercials that featured a 
police photograph of a glowering willie horton a black man who had 
committed rape while on furlough from a massachusetts prison the 
commercial was produced by the national security political action 
committee bush campaign officials disavowed the ad 
lutz said other nominees for the doublespeak award included the 
us airline industry for insisting a united plane that crashed 
near sioux city iowa experienced an uncontained engine 
failure and the fbi for its library awareness program which 
asks librarians to report suspiciouslooking people who might be 
soviet spies

the polish ambassador to washington is 
expected to leave by the end of the year to make room for someone 
who better symbolizes the changes taking place in poland 
according to a senior solidarity figure traveling with lech walesa 
there are a number of names under consideration but nothing 
is settled yet said the official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity because of our need for us assistance it is felt 
that we need in washington a figure who better symbolizes the 
changes taking place in poland 
the current ambassador former deputy foreign minister jan 
kinast is a holdover from the communist administration that was 
replaced in warsaw last august by the solidarityled government 
westerners in warsaw also have picked up signals that kinast may 
be replaced by the end of the year but say that the solidarity 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki plays cards very close to his 
chest and has said publicly that there will be no purge of the 
diplomatic corps 
walesa during his visit this week to washington went out of 
his way to reassure kinast and other communist party members 
working at the embassy that the solidarity government has no plans 
to withdraw him 
but because of kinasts association with the previous communist 
government he is likely to be replaced said the solidarity figure 
who accompanied walesa on his weeklong visit to the united states 
polish embassy officials interviewed during the walesa visit 
said communist party members assigned to the embassy were bending 
over backwards to faithfully represent the interests of the first 
noncommunist government in the soviet bloc 
the embassy officials who also spoke on condition of anonymity 
said solidarity had not assigned watchdogs to monitor the 
activities of polands overseas embassies 
they also noted that mazowiecki had said repeatedly in public 
that communist party officials employed in the diplomatic corps and 
other branches of government would be given a chance to show 
loyalty to the state and would not be purged simply because of 
party membership

east germany was on the brink of a 
crackdown on prodemocracy protesters in leipzig on oct 9 but it 
was averted at the last minute east german conductor kurt masur 
said friday 
masur 62yearold leader of the renowned gewandhaus orchestra 
said blood would have flowed that day if he and five others a 
satirist a churchman and three party officials had not banded 
together and issued an appeal for peace at the last moment 
security forces and troops were massed in the streets and young 
people were ready to die masur said at a news conference 
civil war would have broken out he said 
satirist berndlutz lange added but only one side would have 
been armed it would have been a military attack on the poeople 
recalling that east german leader egon krenz issued statements 
last summer backing the chinas bloody crackdown on prodemocracy 
demonstrators in june masur said we were on the brink of that 
two days earlier scores of demonstrators were beaten and 
arrested when they marched peacefully in leipzig on the 40th 
birthday of east germany 
hundreds more were arrested in east berlin that weekend while 
300 others were jailed after battling riot police in dresden oct 
34 
according to an article in leipzigs newspaper on friday and 
masurs own account the conductor telephoned the communist partys 
local cultural official kurt meyer around 230 pm oct 9 to 
express his anxiety 
meyer got together roland woetzel now leipzigs communist 
party chief and another party official juergen pommert as well 
as lange and a churchman peter zimmermann and all met in masurs 
home 
by 430 pm they had prepared a statement calling for calm and 
promising dialogue which was read out in all the churches where 
peace prayers occurred and also broadcast on a leipzig radio 
station 
the troops and security forces withdrew to side streets and 
leipzigs demonstration passed off peacefully a signal to east 
germans that they could start protesting without fear 
masur and the communists were locked in sharp controversy friday 
over the role played by krenz 
at the news conference woetzel refused repeatedly to say 
whether the troops that day had the order to shoot as leipzig 
opposition groups assert 
he also tried to suggest that krenz a decisive role by giving 
orders from berlin that all should proceed peacefully 
be honest here interrupted masur threatening to walk out 
i am not prepared to play the role of making egon krenz look as 
if he was responsible for the lack of bloodshed masur added 
woetzel then admitted it was only in a later phone call after 
the demonstration started that krenz who was then responsible 
for security on the politburo had given instructions for all to be 
peaceful 
you sometimes find it hard to tell the truth masur 
concluded 
leipzigs communist newspaper leipziger volkszeitung on friday 
praised what it called the historic deed of the six 
particularly lauding the three party men 
they were aware that they had to act independently or bear 
part of the guilt for the final burial of socialism on german soil 
and for a catastrophe which would have endangered european 
security wrote werner bramke a respected east german historian

two federal agencies agreed to curtail the 
loss of wetlands through a unified policy on development the 
administrator of the environmental protection agency announced 
friday 
the epa and the us army corps of engineers share federal 
oversight responsibility for wetlands but their rules have not 
always jibed 
we have had over the years some differences in policy 
reflected in different definitions in different approaches to 
consideration of a proposal to develop a wetland or alter a wetland 
resource william reilly told reporters 
reilly said previous policies have confused the public and 
perhaps contributed to less than a stellar performance in wetlands 
conservation 
he made the announcement after addressing an epa conference 
titled environmental challenges of the 90s the agreement was 
signed wednesday 
under the agreement wetlands development proposals will be 
assessed first in terms of whether alternatives exist reilly said 
after that question has been resolved the agreement calls for the 
two agencies to address questions of compensation in carrying out 
development in the least destructive ways 
reilly said the agreement grew out of president bushs pledge 
that there would be no net loss of wetlands under his 
administration 
the no net loss of wetlands policy does not result in the 
shutdown of all wetlands development opportunities reilly said 
much wetlands decisionmaking is in the hands of state and local 
governments the principal federal power is the corps which grants 
permits for putting fill in waterways and wetlands the epa has 
certain veto powers over the process 
reilly is former president of the conservation foundation which 
sponsored a study group in november 1988 that made similar wetlands 
recommendations 
about 95 million acres of swamps marshes and other wetlands 
exist in the lower 48 states with more than 200 million acres of 
tundra in alaska said cliff rader of the epas wetlands protection 
office in washington 
reilly said 300000 to 500000 acres of wetlands is lost each 
year in the united states because of drainage pollution and 
development 
wetlands once thought to be breeding grounds of disease are 
considered important to water purification and storage habitat for 
wildlife including many endangered species and in the 
productivity of marine life including commercially important 
species

senior administration officials disagreed in 
congressional testimony friday on whether to end the energy 
departments practice of paying all environmental fines incurred by 
companies that run its nuclear weapons plants 
critics of the practice say it weakens the companies incentive 
to comply with environmental protection rules thereby undermining 
efforts to clean up the weapons plants which produce tons of 
radioactive and hazardous wastes each year 
the 17 major facilities that make the nations nuclear weapons 
are owned by the energy department but run by private corporations 
under government contracts 
in a related development senior department officials briefed 
representatives of six states on energy secretary james d watkins 
blueprint for opening the first permanent dump for radioactive 
waste from the weapons plants 
a department official who asked not to be identified said no 
major decisions were made on plans for opening the waste 
isolation pilot plant near carlsbad nm by july 1990 at the 
earliest no firm date is expected to be set until next spring 
the states represented in the meeting washington idaho new 
mexico colorado tennessee and south carolina have rejected a 
watkins proposal that they temporarily store some of the weapons 
waste until the new mexico dump is opened existing storage 
capacity in colorado may be exceeded as early as next april and 
failure to find alternative storage sites could force a halt to 
weapons production 
nevada also has rebuffed watkins urging to take some of the 
waste but was not represented at the meeting the session did not 
resolve the temporary storage problem the official said adding 
that further talks with the state governors would be needed 
the general accounting office the investigative arm of 
congress said in a report released friday that the energy 
department recently paid 295000 in penalties against two 
unidentified weapons plant contractors for violations of laws 
governing hazardous wastes plus 529000 in related legal costs 
of the companies 
stephen a wakefield the departments general counsel urged 
defeat of a house bill to outlaw such indemnification of 
contractors but christian b holmes an acting assistant 
administrator of the environmental protection agency said it was 
completely appropriate to hold the contractors fully 
accountable 
if a contractor violates these laws the contractor should be 
held accountable in the same manner and to the same extent as an 
operator of a private facility holmes told the house energy 
subcommittee on transporation and hazardous materials 
wakefield however said shielding the contractors from 
financial liability is necessary because of the unusual risks they 
assume in running the plants 
while we want to aggressively demand greater management 
accountability and fiscal responsibility from our contractors we 
also have to realize that there may not be many countervailing 
incentives to keep the contractors from walking away 
altogether he said 
wakefield said the department was reviewing the issue and was 
sending letters to members of congress to seek advice on what if 
any policy changes are needed 
the gao in its report said that in addition to picking up the 
tab for the two recent fines imposed against contractors the 
energy department plans to pay all costs resulting from epa and 
state actions pending against four other contractors 
rep ron wyden dore the main sponsor of the house bill that 
would outlaw such payments told the subcommittee its an 
absolute outrage that taxpayers are footing the bill for the 
environmental violations of private companies 
every time the epa gets the contractors where it really hurts 
in the wallet doe soothes their pain by liberally applying 
cash wyden said its no way to hold contractors accountable

a former police captain said 
highranking members of the national police were part of a death 
squad that killed government opponents and staged terrorist attacks 
in six countries a newspaper reported friday 
antiapartheid figures said they were not suprised at the 
allegations published by the afrikaanslanguage free weekly 
newspaper since there have been dozens of unsolved killings of 
activists and bombings of antigovernment organizations in the past 
10 years 
dirk johannes coetzee who left the police force in 1986 was 
quoted as telling the free weekly i was the commander of the 
assassination squad of the south african police my men and i 
killed and eliminated political enemies of the government 
coetzee said five death squad units were formed in 1980 all 
based at a farm near pretoria where the government acknowledged 
that former guerrillas were housed and made part of an antiterror 
unit 
coetzee said he left the squad in 1982 and that its activities 
continued after he left the police force 
the interview was conducted in mauritius where coetzee said he 
fled a week ago after being named by a former black security 
policeman butana nofomela as being part of the death squad 
nofomela was spared from death row after giving information 
about the operation and the longunsolved killings of political 
activists 
coetzee corroborated nofomelas story that a police unit killed 
black antiapartheid lawyer griffiths mxenge in durban in 1982 
poisoning his guard dogs mutilating his body and trying to make it 
look like a robbery 
the newspaper also quoted coetzee as saying 
security police smuggled explosives into britain that were 
used to blow up the african national congress offices there in 1982 
the death squad was responsible for the 1982 assassination of 
ruth first wife of south african communist party leader joe slovo 
and the highest ranking white member of the anc 
several prisoners were poisoned with a special concoction 
developed by a police general 
prisoners were shot or stabbed to death then their bodies 
were burned and the ashes scattered into rivers 
bombs were set in public places and in one case killed a 
child 
he said actions were carried out in lesotho botswana 
swaziland mozambique britain and south africa 
maj gen herman stadler head of the police public relations 
division said it seems strange that capt coetzee who several 
years ago was suspended from the south african police now makes 
these untested and wild allegations from a foreign country where he 
cannot be questioned to verify his claims 
stadler said the allegations would be investigated 
while stadler said coetzee was suspended the newspaper said 
coetzee left under a medical discharge and that it had seen the 
discharge papers 
i know all the secrets of this unit which is above the law 
coetzee was quoted as saying i myself am guilty or at least an 
accomplice to several murders 
regarding the murder of ms first coetzee said his union broke 
into a un office in swaziland stole an envelope with an official 
seal on it and used it to mail a letter bomb that killed ms first 
in maputo mozambique 
he identified more than a dozen other officers including the 
former head of the security police a current police general 
brigadiers and others who have since been promoted to high ranks 
in the police force as having knowledge of or participating in the 
death squad activities 
the south african council of churches whose headquarters was 
blown up in a case that remains unsolved said in a statement that 
coetzees story comes as no surprise to us we have repeatedly 
called for the police to include themselves in whatever 
investigations they may conduct on the attacks of antiapartheid 
people and their property 
the antiapartheid democratic party called for a judicial 
commission recommended that all the officers named by coetzee be 
suspended from duty and said the charges undermine completely 
the credibility of the police 
the african national congress office in london said coetzees 
report of the 1982 bombing there requires immediate action by the 
british government it called for the south african embassy to be 
closed 
the british foreign office said it would await the results of a 
south african investigation

the food and drug administration chief told 
congress on friday the agency needs more authority to punish 
generic drug companies that cheat on safety tests and misrepresent 
data to win product approvals 
fda commissioner frank young also gave a qualified endorsement 
to generic drugs saying the agencys investigation of the 30 
topselling generics provides good assurances about their 
overall safety 
are the generic drugs on the market safe and effective the 
answer appears to be a qualified yes our job is not done 
though and we will keep that qualification until we are done 
young told a house subcommittee 
he added patients using generic drugs should continue using 
them 
young testifying before the energy and commerce investigations 
subcommittee said he will work with lawmakers to beef up fdas 
ability to remove problem generics from the market quicker and to 
take stronger action against the companies that violate fda rules 
he noted that problems have been found with certain 
manufacturers including several that switched their products for 
brandname drugs in tests required to win fda approval 
so far he said none of these cases nor instances of company 
executives attempting to bribe fda employees have compromised the 
safety of any generic drugs that were sold to the public 
as a result of the fdas investigation generic drug companies 
have recalled a total of 83 drugs because of problems ranging from 
manufacturing deficiencies to cheating on safety tests 
in addition the fda has started the lengthy process of 
withdrawing drug approvals for five generic drug makers 
the fda began investigating after the subcommittee turned up 
evidence of fraud so far three former fda employees have been 
convicted of receiving illegal gratuities and three generic drug 
manufacturing executives have been convicted on bribery charges 
the investigations by fda the subcommittee and the us attorneys 
office are continuing and more charges are expected 
the fda does not have broad authority to recall drugs in most 
cases the agency relies on companies to comply with fda requests 
for recalls 
several subcommittee members brought up the possibility of 
giving fda authority to bar future drug approvals from companies 
that are shown to have committed criminal acts to win previous 
approvals 
asked if he felt fda needed that authority young said i 
absolutely do 
young is leaving after more than five years as head of the fda 
next month to take another position within the public health 
service which is part of the department of health and human 
services 
in an interview during a break in the hearing young denied 
speculation that he is being forced out because of the generic drug 
scandal 
if i left last march they would say it was because of the 
chilean grapes imports of which were halted temporarily after a 
poisoning threat he said if i leave now its the generic drugs 
theres always some problem at fda he said adding that 
theres no way to dismount from the tiger without stirring 
speculation 
at the hearing rep john dingell dmich subcommittee 
chairman praised youngs efforts to clean house at the fda and 
warned the generic drug industry that although young is leaving 
the subcommittee will continue its investigation and will make 
sure that a flood light is in place 
an interim report on the fdas investigation into generic drugs 
submitted to the subcommittee said that among 11 generic drug firms 
suspected of wrongdoing inspections found problems at nine of the 
companies including fraudulent drug approval applications 
cutting corners in the manufacturing process and other 
manufacturing deficiencies 
the fda wants to withdraw drug approvals for four of those 
companies bolar pharmaceuticals of copiague ny par 
pharmaceuticals of spring valley ny superpharm corp of central 
islip ny and vitarine pharmaceuticals of springfield gardens 
ny 
among 20 other companies inspected later one firm quantum 
pharmics of amityville ny was found to have falsified records 
for a number of its products and manufacturing deficiencies were 
found at other companies the fda wants to withdraw drug approvals 
for 11 quantum products 
tests on more than 2500 samples of the 30 topselling generic 
drugs are nearly complete and so far have found that nearly 99 
percent of the drugs sampled comply with fda standards 
young said this is consistent with the rates routinely found for 
brandname and generic drugs

two women returned from a trip to africa with a 
new avenue for their social and political connections saving 
elephants from slaughter 
trisha moseley and susanna colloredo founded international tusk 
force a fledgling group devoted to banning international ivory 
trade 
their goal is to make the buying and wearing of ivory as 
politically unfashionable as eating california grapes during the 
united farmworkers boycott of the 1960s and 1970s 
one of the members of the tusk force saw an ivory product in 
the catalog of a major department store moseley said she was 
so mad she cut up her credit card and sent it back to them 
the group formed in may puts out a monthly newsletter with a 
mailing list of about 300 names 
african elephants are threatened by poachers who kill the older 
ones for their tusks which often are shipped to the far east for 
processing into ivory products since june the united states 
japan the 12nation european economic community switzerland and 
canada have banned ivory imports 
but moseley contends plenty of ivory products are still found in 
stores creating a continuous demand and fueling poaching 
the general message is dont buy ivory and dont deal with 
stores that do moseley said 
as the wife of former state rep james moseley she knew how to 
get the attention of politicians colloredo also had clout as the 
wife of ferdinand colloredo who is the former head of a large 
boston real estate firm and president of the influential boston 
business organization known as the vault 
the two women used their connections to organize a boston panel 
discussion thursday on banning the ivory trade featuring

project moseley said 
the women and their families went on safari in africa and 
learned from their guides of diminished elephant herds due to 
poaching

attorney general dick thornburgh said friday 
he wasnt concerned that the justice department would be trying to 
protect widely known information if it blocked the release of 
classified evidence at an upcoming irancontra trial 
the attorney general made the comment when asked about 
widespread speculation that the justice department is preparing to 
block the release of classified information in the case of former 
cia agent joseph fernandez 
administration officials speaking on condition of anonymity 
have indicated the justice department is poised to take that step 
such a move could result in dismissal of charges that fernandez 
lied about his covert involvement in shipping arms to the 
nicaraguan contras when he was cia station chief in san jose costa 
rica 
without saying what the government planned to do thornburgh 
said our responsibility under the congressional directions 
contained in the classified information procedures act is to 
reconcile the need to go forward with a particular criminal case 
with the protection of vital national security information 
thats a responsiblity we take seriously and any action that 
is taken under that act is designed to balance those needs and 
carry out our responsibility 
if we do so im not concerned thornburgh said when asked 
whether he was concerned that if the department took such action in 
the fernandez case it would be blocking the use of information 
about cia operations in central america that is already widely 
known to the public 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh whose office is 
prosecuting fernandez has contended that the bush administration 
would be maintaining a diplomatic fiction by refusing to allow the 
disclosure of cia stations in honduras and el salvador 
the judge in the fernandez case has ruled that the former cia 
agent is entitled to disclose the specific locations in his defense 
as well as the existence of several cia programs 
walsh has conceded the governments desire to protect the cia 
programs saying he could narrow the charges against fernandez if 
that information were suppressed 
us district judge claude m hilton has already rejected 
proposed substitutions for the information and it is not known if 
he would consent to narrowing the charges if that issue were 
presented to him 
thornburgh also dismissed suggestions that the bush 
administration would be merely trying to prevent the disclosure of 
politically embarrassing information 
it is national security information he said we arent in 
the political business we are charged by congress with protecting 
national security information that if disclosed would prejudice our 
national security 
he called it a responsibility which we wont hesitate to carry 
out in a proper case 
but walsh has accused thornburgh of trying to duck that 
responsiblity delaying the start of the trial since july with 
appeals of hiltons secrecy rulings and his refusal to let the 
justice department intervene directly in the case 
at one point the independent counsel accused thornburgh of 
using unannounced procedural maneuvers designed only to tie this 
case in a knot of endless litigation 
earlier this week the justice department said it wont press 
any further appeals of a 4th us circuit court of appeal ruling 
that it cannot intervene in the fernandez case that leaves the 
justice department with the option of filing an affidavit to block 
release of secrets

romanian leader nicolae ceausescu appears 
to have set the tone for next weeks meeting of his communist 
party blasting what he called reactionaries who want reform 
there were also reports that the government bucking a tide of 
political and economic reform in the soviet bloc was taking 
measures to prevent any upheaval during the fiveday party congress 
that begins monday in bucharest 
the maverick ceausescu was the only warsaw pact leader to defy 
the soviets in the 1960s and 1970s by not permitting joint military 
exercises in his country and by not participating in the sovietled 
invasion of czechoslovakia 
such independence in foreign policy decisions earned him 
admiration in the west while drawing attention away from 
repression at home coupled with a personality cult around the 
conducator or leader as ceausescu is called that has 
become unique in europe 
now with democratization reshaping most of the soviet bloc it 
is ceausescus steadfast refusal to introduce political and 
economic freedoms that increasingly have isolated him within the 
warsaw pact 
even hardline leaders in czechoslovakia have paid at least 
lipservice to the need to introduce some market forces and 
plurality of opinion to economies and societies directed from the 
top 
but the romanian communist party totally controlled by its 
ironwilled leader considers any reform of the stalinist model 
treasonous 
romanian diplomats in vienna said ceausescu was expected to 
endorse continuation of the status quo monday in a keynote speech 
at the opening of the congress 
the thursday issue of the party daily scinteia quoted the 
71year old ceausescu whose 24 years at the helm of romania make 
him the longestserving soviet bloc leader in comments that 
presaged the tenor of the congress 
in a blanket condemnation of reforms as violating the basic 
principles of socialism ceausescu also accused reactionary 
circles of exploiting confusion in the communist camp 
a scientia banner headline proclaimed the aim of the congress 
the reelection of the most beloved son of our nation comrade 
nicolae ceausescu as party leader a historic option of the entire 
party and people 
ceausescus grip on the party means he does not have to fear the 
kind of overt grassroots discontent that led to the recent ouster 
of his hardline east german and bulgarian counterparts and their 
replacement with reformminded leaders 
recent meetings in 40 counties named ceausescu proteges as 
delegates to the congress and nominated his wife two sons and 
three brothers for election or reelection to some of the top party 
posts 
but there are signs of fear that opposition could come from 
another quarter the military which is said to be restive after 
years of forced duty in the fields mines and other civilian areas 
producing for export or for the shortageplagued domestic sector 
a romanian emigre in west germany said thursday a dissident 
source in bucharest told him of rumors that senior officers had 
been sent on leave for the duration of the congress apparently out 
of fears of a possible coup attempt 
there were unconfirmed reports in 1983 that a group of generals 
had tried to topple ceausescu the reports were strengthened a few 
months later by a rash of promotions to generals ranks 
romania which owed foreign banks and governments 11 billion in 
1981 declared itself debtfree last spring after an accelerated 
program of producing for export that left store shelves bare 
apartments cold and private cars idled because of gasoline 
rationing 
shortages persist however as romania continues to export much 
of what it grows or makes in an attempt to shore up its 
convertable currency supplies rationing of energy was announced 
early this month for the sixth winter in a row while staples such 
as meat butter white flour cooking oil and eggs are rationed all 
year 
in a rare move probably provoked by growing restiveness because 
of the catastrophic food shortages ceausescu last month toured 
poorly stocked markets in bucharest and promised better supplies 
the source who spoke on condition of anonymity also reported 
unusally strict security measures in bucharest 
in the past week roadblocks were erected on all main roads 
leading to bucharest with armed officers checking identification 
he said 
the main railway station and otopeni airport were being 
patrolled by police squads while the area near the 5000seat 
palace hall site of the congress was declared off limits to all 
but residents who had to show identification 
on the agenda of the congress is approval of a fiveyear 
economic plan as well as the election of the central committee 
the politburo and the party leader

hundreds of thousands of east germans snacked 
in the streets and gazed into the windows of electronics stores 
friday night as they began a second weekend celebrating 
theirnewfound freedom in west berlin 
although the city was busier than usual as the visitors from the 
east began pouring in there was little of the tumultuous street 
party atmosphere that engulfed the western sector a week ago 
city officials said 500000 east germans had arrived in west 
berlin by friday night 
wed like to stay all night and make a party said 
18yearold east berliner ellen eversberg but already we can see 
a party here costs a lot of money 
ms eversberg and two friends were picking up free maps set out 
in the lobby of a bank they planned to go home after a look around 
and return in the morning to line up at banks for their 100 marks 
54 in welcome money 
for the second straight weekend west berlin banks will open 
saturday and sunday to dispense the welcome money 
electronics stores in the kurfuerstsendamm the main shopping 
street were closed like most other stores by evening but they 
attracted the biggest groups of windowshoppers 
the aroma of grilled bratwurst drifted across the sidewalks from 
steet stalls 
on the steps of the bombscarred church of remembrance two men 
each clutching a can of beer chanted east berlin there is no 
wall 
outside the offices of berliner morgenpost the main daily 
newspaper staffers dispensed free coffee to lines of east 
berliners 
wed like east germans to get to know us one said as the 
new arrivals started curiously at the displays of fridays edition 
at checkpoint charlie on the berlin wall a steady trickle of 
trabbi cars and pedestrians moved through 
at a us army base at mariendorf in the west of the city 
american troops set up a soup kitchen at the requst of the west 
german authorities to feed 1400 east german families who want to 
stay permanently 
the families were being sent to government reception centers for 
the night 
as west berliners girded for the influx there were signs that 
the welcome mat might be wearing a bit thin 
of course its a wonderful thing they are free to come 
here said gertie starke manager of an upmarket clothing store 
heinemann on the kurfuerstendamm 
but commercially its a disaster our customers are simply not 
prepared to come into town with these sort of crowds theyve been 
driven out and if this keeps up we can forget christmas 
last week immmediately after east germanys abrupt decision 
nov 9 to let its citizens travel freely 13 million east germans 
poured in and west berlin already crowded home to 2 million 
turned into a giant street party 
this weekend it could be even better or worse depending on 
ones perspective 
heinemann where a cashmere jacket costs about 680 has the 
sort of customers who dont need to go where shopping means 
fighting for space on the sidewalk 
and it has absolutely nothing for customers whose spending power 
consists of the onceayear welcome money from the west german 
government 
but others were adapting street stalls selling nail polish 
trinkets oranges and bananas proliferated 
electronic goods stores spent the week organizing stock of cheap 
items they dont stock normally such as nofrills portable stereos 
at 25 
and there were are the levi jeans posters for those who cant 
afford to go home with the real thing the ultimate badge of 
western consumerism 
ron marcus who runs a large jeans store stocked up with 
several thousand levi posters he said he was opening an additional 
section on saturday selling tshirts and for east germans only 
halfprice jeans at 35 
they just freaked out over the jeans last weekend said 
marcus but most of them havent got money for anything so we 
thought of the posters as something we could do 
fastfood chains which are within the range of east german 
pockets were laying in for a seige 
mcdonalds manager martin meissner ran job ads for parttime 
helpers through the week but got a poor response he said he was 
offering double time to keep the regular staff on 12 and 24 hours 
shifts 
the east germans have turned our worst month of the year into 
the best said meissner 
hurbert plura who has a pretzel stall on the sidewalk was also 
prepared last weekend plura was home an hour after he set up the 
stall the time it took to sell his days supply of 500 pretzels 
hes ordered 4000 for this weekend

regulators said friday they will dissolve the 
federal asset disposition association after an unsuccessful attempt 
to sell the quasiprivate agency established to manage and sell 
loans and real estate from failed savings institutions 
almost since its creation in 1985 fada has been the target of 
harsh criticism from members of congress who charged that the 
federally owned but privately controlled financial institution 
had grown into a bloated inefficient bureaucracy mired in 
political favoritism and inside dealing 
legislation enacted aug 9 ordered a new agency the resolution 
trust corp to sell fada if it could or dissolve it if it 
couldnt 
the 3 billion portfolio of loans and real estate managed by 
fada will revert to the government 
the rtc was offering to sell fadas offices in washington los 
angeles atlanta denver and dallas and its computer system and 
office furnishings however regulators were unwilling to sell the 
agencys name charter as a financial institution cash or rights 
to asset management contracts 
steven seelig rtc director of fada oversight said the three 
bids received for fada all had conditions attached that made them 
unacceptable one bidder for instance wanted to retain asset 
management contracts but also have the right to buy the assets a 
violation of the rtc conflict of interest policy he said 
the three bidders were je robert companies an alexandria 
va real estate management firm ncnb texas national bank dallas 
and real estate advisory services corp denver 
fadas 275 employees will be offered jobs with the rtc or with 
the federal deposit insurance corp seelig said a few highly paid 
senior employees of fada may opt to quit when the dissolution 
becomes effective at the end of january rather than accept a job at 
government pay 
previously the fdic announced it would try to sell 428 million 
in fadamanaged properties in a block the package includes 150 
properties located in texas california colorado arizona and 
florida

peace plan aimed at ending the insurgency members of the tamil 
minority claim discrimination by the sinhalese majority and tamil

at a heated meeting friday with premier nikolai i 
ryzhkov striking coal miners said the government is not keeping 
its promises to improve their working and living conditions the 
tass news agency reported 
it said that during the meeting in the kremlin the miners 
demanded that officials responsible for the lack of progress be 
punished 
tass said ryzhkov told the miners each side must bear its 
share of responsibility it indicated the premier stopped short 
of directly asking the 15000 miners from the soviet arctic to 
return to work 
miners began the walkout oct 25 at 12 of the 13 mines near 
vorkuta 950 miles northeast of moscow to press the government to 
fulfill promised increases in pensions and wage differentials for 
hazardous working conditions and improvements in living conditions 
the government made the promises to end strikes that affected 
virtually all the countrys coalfields in july 
in renewing their walkout the vorkuta miners added political 
demands including removing language in the soviet constitution 
making the communist party the leading force of society they also 
demand that power be turned over to local governing councils land 
to farmers and factories to workers 
they have defied earlier appeals by ryzhkov president mikhail 
s gorbachev and other officials to return to work even though the 
strike is depleting fuel supplies as the country heads into winter 
tass reported ryzhkov told the miners at the meeting held in a 
heated atmosphere that the strikes have caused a shortfall of 
14 million tons of coal 
he said pension increases for miners and longer vacations were 
provided for in legislation now before the soviet legislature 
according to tass 
it reported the miners representatives said significant 
changes in the coal sphere and the solution of social problems of 
miners have not yet occurred 
more than once at the meeting demands were heard to punish 
those who hinder or delay improvements tass said

press to visit vorkuta an area long closed to foreigners 
on tuesday the miners lost an appeal of a court ruling that 
their strike was illegal the decision by the supreme court of the 
russian federation the republic where the miners are from means 
the strike organizers face firing from their jobs and fines of 
1620 each

attorney general dick thorburgh returned 
nearly 46 million in confiscated drug revenues to the houston 
police department on friday saying booty of the drug trade can 
be turned into offensive weapons for law enforcement 
thornburghs decision personally to present a check for the 46 
million to assistant police chief dennis storemski sends a 
signal that houston is being recognized as one of the major 
points for illegal drugs entering the country said rep jack 
fields rtexas 
but thornburgh declined to say whether the justice department 
would recommend houston and the texasmexico border be declared a 
highintensity drug trafficking zone which would make the region 
eligible for increased federal help in attacking the narcotics 
trade 
the 46 million returned to houston was seized in a joint 
investigation earlier this year involving the internal revenue 
service and houston police 
a twoweek aroundtheclock surveillance led to raids on two 
stash houses in which 4 million in cash was seized another 
169 million was taken from a vehicle the federal government gets 
to keep part of such seized cash in this case slightly more than 
1 million 
were here to illustrate a new twist on an old maxim that 
is to illustrate the notion that crime does pay for effective law 
enforcement thornburgh said 
storemski said the money would be used to pay informants and to 
buy vehicles surveillance equipment and other equipment 
since its creation in 1985 the asset forfeiture fund has shared 
more than 290 million with local and state agencies

a ustrained team of salvadoran forensic 
experts has begun an investigation of the slaying of six jesuit 
priests and two others in el salvador the state department said 
friday 
regardless of who the perpetrators are we want punishment for 
those attempting to hinder the process of peace and democracy in el 
salvador said spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
she noted that salvadoran president alfredo christiani had 
assured us ambassador william walker that even if members of the 
salvadoran armed forces were involved they will feel the full 
weight of the law 
the united states expects him to meet that commitment said 
ms tutwiler 
she said us officials will certainly be forthcoming in our 
help if asked by the salvadoran government to assist directly in 
the investigation 
the special investigative unit is equipped and trained and 
funded by the united states ms tutwiler told reporters it is 
conducting a forensic examination of this crime and they have 
its my understanding already taken samples from the scene and 
will conduct the autopsies 
she said the unit was formed about six years ago 
when it has been deployed it has been effective ms 
tutwiler said recalling that in one case its investigation had led 
to the arrest of two army officers and seven soldiers who are in 
jail awaiting trial 
she said she was unable to confirm or deny reports that 
witnesses had said they had seen men in uniform enter the jesuit 
rectory before the slayings 
she said there were no american advisers out in the field with 
the investigative unit 
ms tutwiler said the state department had heard reports that 
threats were made against the jesuits in a national radio callin 
program before the slayings 
we condemn that call for violence as we condemn in the 
strongest possible terms the tragic killings themselves she 
said

a judge ordered the british 
broadcasting corp on friday to give police the television film of 
a rally at which moslems allegedly raised their hands in favor of 
killing novelist salman rushdie 
the bbc had refused the police request but said it would comply 
with the ruling by judge michael sachs of the manchester high court 
the film showed a rally in manchester last month at which 
moslems were allegedly asked to vote on whether rushdie should die 
for the blasphemy against islam contained in his novel the 
satanic verses and some raised their hands in favor 
manchester police asked prosecutors to consider criminal 
proceedings and the prosecutors asked police to obtain transmitted 
and untransmitted film of the rally 
the judge viewed a section of the tape and ruled it was 
relevant he ordered it to be handed over and the bbc will comply 
with that order said a spokesman for the bbcs manchester office 
he would not say the material to be given to police had been 
included in a report the bbc broadcast oct 21 the hearing before 
the judge was closed 
the spokesman who requested anonymity said the standing policy 
of all british broadcasters was to refuse to provide film to 
authorities 
if the bbc was to allow automatic access to untransmitted 
material our own staff could become victims in hostile actions 
and we have a duty to protect our staff and thereby safeguard 
our ability to cover the news he said 
rushdie has been in hiding since february when the late 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini of iran declared that he had committed 
blasphemy in the satanic verses and ordered his followers to 
kill the novelist

federal reserve policymakers decided to keep 
interest rates unchanged early this fall but agreed to ease their 
grip on credit if developments warranted according to minutes of 
their october meeting released friday 
in fact the central bank surprised everyone on nov 7 when it 
permitted a key interest rate the federal funds rate to drop from 
875 percent to 85 percent 
manipulation of this rate the interest banks charge each other 
for overnight loans is the primary lever the fed uses to control 
shortterm interest rates 
the initial decision to keep rates unchanged was reached on a 
92 vote at an oct 3 meeting of the feds open market committee 
composed of fed governors in washington and five of the 12 fed 
regional bank presidents 
the committee met again last tuesday but minutes of that 
session will not be released until late december the committee 
gathers in secret eight times a year to formulate monetary policy 
and confers by telephone as needed 
the washington post reported nov 8 the latest decision to ease 
rates was made during a telephone conference call nov 6 among 
members of the open market committee 
the quarterpoint drop was the fifth small decline that has 
occurred since late may when the central bank began to reverse a 
yearlong effort to drive interest rates higher as a way to fight 
inflationary pressure 
at its oct 3 meeting the committee noted that underlying 
inflationary pressures were likely to ease a little over the next 
several quarters while economic activity continued to expand at 
a moderate pace in the third quarter 
as a result the minutes said all but two of the members 
indicated that they preferred or could accept a directive that 
called for maintaining the current degree of pressure and that 
provided for giving particular weight to potential developments

the new east german premier said friday his 
country is open to private enterprise and foreign investment to 
meet the needs of frustrated consumers but warned of hard economic 
times ahead 
in his first speech to the east german parliament as head of the 
government hans modrow recommended greater cooperation with 
economically powerful west germany while rejecting reunification 
the official news agency adn released a letter from president 
bush telling the new leadership the united states is interested in 
closer relations 
by friday night about 12 million east germans had entered all 
of west germany including west berlin presaging a second wild 
weekend of shopping and sightseeing since east germany opened its 
borders nov 9 
although east germanys economy inspires envy in the soviet 
bloc communist party chief egon krenz and his new leadership have 
made clear that debts and a dwindling labor force will prevent it 
from catching the west anytime soon 
more than 200000 east germans nearly 1 percent of the 
population have moved to west germany the past several months 
most are young skilled workers vital to the countrys industry 
modrow sketched a blueprint for economic recovery that mixes a 
few freemarket principles into the state plan for the nation of 
165 million 
he said talk of reunification was dangerous and unrealistic 
and instead directed attention toward a course of reform similar to 
that set for the soviet union by president mikhail s gorbachev 
gorbachevs model aims at social renewal through democratic 
freedoms of speech assembly and the press and at allowing workers 
to produce goods or provide services privately in their free time 
east german economists have rejected the more marketoriented 
reforms embraced by poland and hungary whose economies are in far 
worse condition 
predicting hard times ahead modrow said continued budget 
deficits will be necessary and the government must bring prices 
into line with production costs which will be hard on the nations 
disproportionate number of pensioners 
he blamed the current deficits on squandering of state money 
and excessive administrative outlays 
modrow also revealed his proposed cabinet at the beginning of a 
twoday session of parliament eleven of the 28 places were given 
to noncommunists members of four small political groups allied 
with the party 
the 44member cabinet forced out nov 7 had only four members 
from the allied parties which were formed to create a semblance of 
open government and have become more independent since the 
prodemocracy movement began 
east germany is open for proposals on joint ventures 
investment transfer of profits and environmental pilot projects 
modrow said all of which address concerns of western business 
leaders interested in the east german market 
he said the government sees as its most urgent responsibility 
the stabilization of the economy 
talking with journalists after the session modroww urged east 
germans not to trade their nonconvertible marks on the black 
market in order to buy goods in west germany he conceded one west 
german mark costs 20 east german on the black market although the 
official rate set by east germany is 1for1 
relations with west germany should be strengthened by agreements 
dealing with security cooperation environmental protection and 
other matters of common interest modrow said in his parliament 
speech 
by means of a new reality of life in the german democratic 
republic east germany the dangerous and unrealistic talk of a 
reunification will be clearly rejected he said to long applause 
bonns reaction to agreements was wary west germany does not 
recognize the nations division and volker ruehe of the christian 
democrats chancellor helmut kohls political party said signing 
treaties could be tantamount to such recognition 
modrow and krenz are fighting time to improve the economy and 
stem the tide of emigration and also face increasing demands for 
free elections 
manfred gerlach of the liberal democrats one of the four 
parties allied with the communists is a leading voice for free 
elections 
gerlach whose party has three ministries in modrows cabinet 
told the 500member parliament the liberal democrats no longer 
would run their candidates in a bloc with the communists and called 
for true sharing of power in free choice by the voters 
his proposal for free elections and new legislation on voting 
and campaign procedures did not address the question of recognizing 
new forum and other prodemocracy groups that have agitated for a 
role in government 
earlier this week gerlach said he would ask the parliament to 
remove the constitutional provision of a leading role for the 
communist party that guarantees its supremacy he did not mention 
it in his speech friday but the session still has a day to run

eleven months after the bombing of pan am 
flight 103 over scotland the government and airlines still are 
endangering lives with lax aviation security relatives of the 
flight victims told a presidential commission friday 
the confidence of the public has been badly shaken and will 
not return until the truth is told and remedies are put into 
place said paul hudson whose 16yearold daughter was one of 
270 people killed in the dec 21 1988 bombing 
the sevenmember presidential commission on aviation security 
and terrorism held the first of several hearings into government 
conduct before and after the destruction of the boeing 747 airliner 
by plastic explosives concealed in a radiocassette player british 
investigators blame the bombing on terrorists whom they have not 
identified 
we wont let you down commission chairwoman ann mclaughlin 
told relatives of americans who died in the crash the former labor 
secretary said the commission would evaluate aviation security the 
handling of terrorist threats against air travel and whether the 
public should be told of them and the governments treatment of 
terrorists victims 
we will let the chips fall where they may mrs mclaughlin 
said the commission is to make recommendations to president bush 
in may the panel which has a 1 million budget for six months 
includes four members of congress and two prominent military men 
the panel also is considering the similar destruction of a 
french uta dc10 over the african country of niger on sept 19 
which killed 174 people including seven americans the goal is to 
find ways of protecting us citizens who fly on foreign carriers 
alexander alimanestianu of new york city whose father mihai 
died aboard the chadparis flight compared aviation terrorists to 
serial murderers we know the next one is being plotted right now 
another bomb another plane its just a matter of time he 
said 
in other testimony at the daylong hearing 
richard lally vice president of the air transport association 
which represents us airlines said the government should pay for 
improved bombdetection devices and asked for ratification of a 
treaty that will give us victims of air terrorism greater 
compensation 
christopher witkowski of the aviation consumer action project 
said aviation security is inadequate because it has been planned by 
a closeknit group of industry representatives and the faa 
without passenger involvement 
billie h vincent former faa security director said aviation 
security is seriously deficient in highthreat areas such as 
europe and the middle east 
peter reiss of the air line pilots association said a thermal 
neutron analysis device like the ones the faa has ordered us 
airlines to install at airports throughout the world would not have 
detected the flight 103 bomb without disrupting airline schedules 
with false alarms he said the technology has to be improved before 
it can be used widely 
relatives of the more than 180 americans killed in the pan am 
bombing have formed a nationwide group that had asked for a 
fullscale congressional investigation 
mrs mclaughlin said she had ties to three victims of flight 
103 a cousin bernie mclaughlin jd flynn a son of a college 
classmate and karen noonan a college student who worked in her 
office when she was secretary of labor 
mrs mclaughlin said this gave a personal dimension to her 
interest in aviation security but said she had never joined the 
relatives organization she said she was picked to head the 
commission because of her government experience 
the american government has broken faith with its citizens it 
has turned its back on its responsibility to protect the lives of 
american citizens at home and abroad said bert ammerman 
president of the group he had a brother aboard flight 103 which 
had just left london en route from frankfurt to new york city when 
it blew up 
victoria cummock of coral gables fla held up the badly 
damaged attache case of her husband who died aboard the flight 
and said ladies and gentlemen this is what remains of john 
cummock 
mrs cummock said she wanted the commission to feel the effects 
of the disaster on her allamerican family so the bombing would 
not be considered just an unfortunate isolated incident or an 
inconvenience in a system that occasionally goes on the blink 
members of the commission include sens frank r lautenberg 
dnj and alfonse damato rny reps james oberstar dminn 
and john hammerschmidt rark former assistant navy secretary 
edward hidalgo and retired air force gen thomas c richards

multiparty system and some independence said friday that president

party told lithuanian television the meeting thursday went well

the national partys ruling politburo in moscow 
kestutas zalauskas party chief in the vilnius the lithuanian 
capital told the republics presidium that when the meeting 
began gorbachev was sitting with a very angry face but at the 
end of the meeting everything calmed down said longinas

communists must have a program that is acceptable to the people 
and understandable to them for local elections scheduled in 
february 
sajudis the lithuanian peoples front trounced regular 
communist party candidates in the soviet unions first multiple 
candidate elections last spring sajudis candidates including 
communist party dissidents won 36 of the 42 parliamentary seats in 
the lithuanian republic

dec 19 to prepare for the election and consider a program designed 
to make the party a political force in the creation of an 
independent lawgoverned lithuanian state 
a draft of the program endorses a multiparty system and creation 
of a democratic socialist society it does not call for secession 
from the soviet union but would establish a sovereign lithuanian 
state that has cultural and economic ties with the ussr it 
makes no mention of political ties 
the congress also will consider splitting the lithuanian 
communist party from the soviet communist party a move strongly 
opposed by gorbachev 
brazauskas said in the television interview that the lithuanian 
partys entire central committee will face election at the congress 
to ensure that it represents party members

be no immediate split but the lithuanians also told the kremlin 
leaders that democratization has gone so deep in lithuania that 
not everything depends on the communist party anymore

communist parties in the various republics naming its own man to 
the number two spot and influencing the selection of the first 
secretary 
a report by the tass news agency said thursdays meeting 
stressed the special responsibility which rests on the lithuanian

to the cheers and song of thousands of 
onlookers friday workers toppled a statue of felix dzerzhinsky 
the polish aristocrat who organized the soviet secret police after 
the 1917 bolshevik revolution 
as the metal statue came crashing down breaking into three 
sections many in the crowd hammered away at it hoping to take 
home a piece the heavy metal did not bend or break under their 
blows 
move back move back the foreman told the crowd well 
give him dzerzhinsky to you 
under dzerzhinskys rule the cheka forerunner of the kgb was 
responsible for a wave of terror against opponents of the new 
soviet regime in poland he was nicknamed bloody felix 
on thursday city workers started breaking apart the concrete 
pavement around the base of the statue in the center of warsaw 
slogans painted since thursday on the base of the statue said 
felus tirana is waiting a reference to the capital of 
albania which still pursues hardline stalinist policies felus is 
a diminutive of felix in polish 
other slogans said beijing is all yours and dont come 
back here another in english said simply go away 
many poles despised the large metal statue of dzerzhinsky who 
founded the cheka on orders from soviet leader vladimir i lenin 
dzerzhinsky died in 1926 
the monument was erected in 1951 at the height of stalinism in 
poland on the prewar bank square which then became known as 
dzerzhinsky square city authorities say the prewar name will be 
restored 
a similar monument and square dedicated to dzerzhinsky are 
located in moscow not far from the kremlin 
the decision to tear down the monument in warsaw was taken by 
jerzy boleslawski the communist mayor and announced monday the 
government newspaper rzeczpospolita quoted him as saying it would 
make way for construction of a new subway system 
other monuments in poland to communist leaders of the stalinist 
era have been torn down since the independent solidarity trade 
union was made legal again in april

parties tried to form a joint government friday but failed 
increasing the possibility that a third election will follow two 
that have ended in deadlock 
the political consultations will continue on monday at noon 
conservative leader constantine mitsotakis of the new democracy 
party told reporters afterward 
he met with andreas papandreou the former socialist premier 
and communist leader harilaos florakis since the nov 5 elections 
each has failed in a separate effort to form a coalition with a 
majority in the 300set parliament 
none of the three indicated whether progress was ade on friday 
if the three leaders cannot get together president christos 
sartzetakis is expected to call another election 
police meanwhile fought running battles friday in central athens 
with youths who rioted on the fringes of a march commemorating a 
student uprising nov 17 1973 
three riot policemen and a reporter were slightly injured by 
stones thrown by about 200 rioters who firebombed a police bus a 
department store and the entrance of an apartment block 
more than 20 young people were killed in the revolt at the 
athens polytechnic the military regime collapsed in 1974 after 
seven years in power 
during fridays melee the rioters built burning roadblocks and 
smashed the windows of six banks police said no one was arrested 
political observers believe the results of the next election 
would be the same no one party would win enough seats in the 
300member parliament to govern alone 
in the nov 5 balloting new democracy took 148 seats three 
short of an absolute majority papandreous panhellenic socialist 
movement won 128 and the coalition garnered 21 two independents 
and an environmentalist took the remaining three seats

conservativecommunist government led the country until the 
november elections 
all three political leaders have said they want to avoid new 
elections but differ on its goals and duration 
mitsotakis and florakis said they favor an allparty government 
that would govern until march when presidential elections will make 
another poll mandatory if no candidate receives at least 180 votes 
in parliament 
according to the constitution new elections are called if 
parliament fails to choose a president the newly elected 
parliament can then pick a president with a simple majority vote 
papandreou agrees with florakis the electoral system should be 
replaced by simple proportional representation but mitsotakis says 
such a change would create unstable governments 
the three parties are also divided over negotiations with the 
united states on the continued presence of their military 
installations in the country a usgreek defense accord expired 
in december 
despite 17 rounds of negotiations with a pasok government before 
it failed to be reelected in june after eight years in office the 
bases issue remains unsolved 
papandreou said he wants one more round of negotiations before 
the draft agreement is put to a national referendum the 
communistled coalition said it would support an allparty 
government only if the us bases were shut down while mitsotakis 
said retaining the bases is vital to greeces security

about 10000 people rallied outside 
parliament friday to demand that ousted leader todor zhivkov be 
tried on allegations he amassed a fortune and new communist party 
chief petar mladenov said he favored free elections 
the statesponsored rally followed a shakeup in the communist 
party and government leadership that forced out several zhivkov 
supporters mladenov who replaced zhivkov last week as party 
chief was named friday to succeed him in the largely ceremonial 
role of head of state 
mladenov told french television friday that free elections were 
certainly possible 
as far as i am concerned i am for free elections mladenov 
said in the interview 
however he added that the leadership wanted first to study the 
reform course of other east bloc countries we must look study 
and afterward we must make decisions he said 
at the rally the crowd loudly cheered deputy slavcho trnski 
who launched an unprecedented attack on zhivkov during the 
parliament session marchers carrying banners for perestroika and 
waving bulgarian flags chanted zhivkov to court 
mladenov in his acceptance speech to the parliament or 
national assembly leveled harsh criticism at zhivkov without 
mentioning him by name 
he said the parliament which has been a rubberstamp body for 
party policy was deprived of its legal rights and turned 
into a facade of peoples power such kind of situation cannot 
be qualified otherwise but as an insult to the whole nation 
this refers to a most drastic deformation one of the greatest 
sins which our people and society will probably never forgive 
mladenov said according to a text of the speech carried by the 
state bta news agency 
the structures of the command and bureaucratic system are 
beginning to shake mladenov was quoted as saying the 
administrative idols of yesterday are going to pieces 
mladenov formerly foreign minister also spoke of radical 
political and economic changes but was not specific 
the crowd estimated at 10000 by western journalists booed 
official speakers they apparently associated with zhivkov 
after the onehour rally in front of the national assembly 
ended about 500 people gathered at an unofficial rally and 
chanted we want democracy and down with the murderers 
they called out the names of soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
and mladenov marched down the street and then dispersed calling 
see you tomorrow to one another 
an unofficial rally planned for saturday appears to have been 
given official approval 
on thursday the communist party central committee dismissed 
three hardline politburo members and installed four men likely to 
support mladanov 53 in implementing reforms 
trnskis attack was the first harsh public criticism of zhivkov 
78 who gained power two years after josef stalins death with the 
aid of the soviet dictators supporters and ran the country in a 
rigid stalinist fashion 
the televised national assembly session was the first glimpse 
for most bulgarians of the closed corridors of power from which 
their lives have been controlled for two generations 
in a hint of impending reform under mladenov legislators also 
voted to strike article 273 of the penal code which was used to 
punish anyone deemed to have slandered the state or party that 
means the countrys new proreform groups may suffer less 
harassment from police than before 
an independent group called committee 273 was formed this year 
to press for the change 
the national assembly also removed some old guard communists 
from the government and created an ecology ministry to address 
environmental concerns the led to formation of the independent 
group ecoglasnost 
parliament dismissed petko danchev a deputy premier and stoyan 
ovcharov minister of economy and planning from the government 
both of are zhivkov allies who were dropped thursday as nonvoting 
members of the ruling politburo 
stoyan mihailov a reformer who was removed from the central 
committee last year and fired as party ideologist was named 
minister of education and culture an important post in mladenovs 
quest for support from intellectuals 
nikolai dankerov was given the new ecology ministry and voyko 
dimitrov succeeds mladenov as foreign minister 
the 400member national assembly voted unanimously by show of 
hands to dismiss zhivkov as head of state then again to replace 
him with mladenov 
in an unusually frank debate deputies praised mladenovs 
enthusiasm for reform and cricized zhivkov 
trnski accused the former communist party chief of indulging in 
a flamboyant lifestyle while bulgaria fell into economic crisis 
he said zhivkov owned 30 homes was hungry for fame and had 
retained power through a policy of divide and rule 
the deputy also demanded an investigation of alleged misuse of 
funds by zhivkovs son vladimir who was removed from the central 
committee on thursday and is rumored to be involved in several 
scandals 
at the official demonstration outside the national assembly 
building trnski told the crowd sofia has not seen such an 
emotional meeting in 45 years since the soviet army occupied the 
country in september 1944 
cheers rose for defense minister dobri dzhurov considered a 
leading proponent of reform he told the crowd the leadership 
changes were made in the name of the people 
after an hour the demonstrators sang the bulgarian national 
anthem and dispersed

back to west germany 
ok ok the 62yearold swami replied he shoved a 
homemade peace passport nd retraced his steps

those that didnt burst on the branches of a tree floated right 
back 
at the brandenburg gate the wind was wrong again more 
balloons this time trailing pictures of his kite floated 
stubbornly westward 
ever resourceful the swami tried his luck with a dozen doves 
most of them flew west 
moving right along in the quest for something workable the 
swamis party arrived at the tiny airstrip on the edge of west 
berlin from which he took off in 1983 
then the real trouble started a model plane supposed to fly 
around trailing a small peace banner wouldnt start then did but 
crashed twice when it finally was airborne the banner was twisted 
and unreadable 
it was too late by then for the the highlight of the plan 
crossing into east berlin to present a letter of thanks to 
communist leader egon krenz for answering the swamis prayers to 
open the wall 
was that the end of the swamis tale of woe nope his followers 
discovered during the week that his kite had been destroyed 
what can you do he said and shrugged well go tomorrow 
id like to thank them anyway for being so nice when i was 
arrested they gave me a cheese sandwich and a subway ticket 
in 1983 the indianborn swami landed his kite in a field 
outside east berlin was sent back to the west after six hours of 
interrogation he leads the svinanda yoga vendata sect based in

soldiers shot and wounded 15 palestinians in 
the occupied lands friday and palestinian militants stabbed and 
injured two fellow arabs they suspected of collaborating with 
israeli authorities 
the army prepared to call up two reserve units of jewish 
settlers to serve in the occupied west bank and gaza strip israel 
radio and the independent maariv newspaper reported 
maariv said the units would begin deployment in early december

began 23 months ago 
the scheduled deployment caused a furor among leftwing 
legislators who said units of rightwing settlers could increase 
violence in the occupied territories 
critics also said deployment of the reserve regional defense 
units which in the occupied territories are primarily comprised 
of setters could politicize the army 
in israel all jewish men through age 54 serve up to 40 days 
annual reserve duty until a spate of settler attacks against arabs 
several years ago settlers often were assigned to reserve duty by 
their homes 
at least 615 palestinians have been killed by israelis in the 
uprising and 42 israelis have died twentyfour of the arab deaths 
have been attributed to settlers and the rest were killed by 
soldiers 
in the occupied west bank four palestinians were wounded by 
army gunfire and one arab was shot in a clash with settlers arab 
reporters said 
the army confirmed one wounded in the west bank by army gunfire 
and said the military was investigating reports that a palestinian 
in the town of ramallah was shot and wounded by settlers 
in the gaza strip 10 palestinians were wounded in clashes with 
troops 
two arabs in gaza city were stabbed and beaten by palestinian 
activists on suspicion of cooperating with israeli authorities 
at least 146 arabs have been killed by fellow palestinians

gov robert p casey on friday signed a 
bill giving pennsylvania the most restrictive abortion law in the 
country 
the action makes pennsylvania the first state to take advantage 
of a us supreme court ruling in july that gave states more leeway 
in making their own abortion laws it takes effect in 60 days 
casey said he believes the bill is constitutional and will not 
provide a test case to challenge the supreme courts 1973 roe vs 
wade ruling which gave women the constitutional right to an 
abortion 
in a statement he said the provisions of the law are 
appropriate and reasonable given the enormity of the decision any 
woman faces when she considers having an abortion the overwhelming 
votes in the state house and senate convince me that the vast 
majority of our people will agree 
the state house of representatives passed the bill by a vote of 
143 to 58 the senate approved it 33 to 17 
the law bans abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy except 
to save the life of the mother or prevent substantial and 
irreversible harm prohibits abortions based on the fetus sex 
requires women to inform their husbands if they plan to get an 
abortion regulates the medical use of tissue from aborted fetuses 
and mandates that women wait 24 hours to get an abortion 
also under the law doctors will have to inform women about the 
procedure before performing an abortion and tell her the likely age 
of the fetus as well as explain risks and alternatives 
the law carries stiff penalties for doctors who violate the 
regulations a conviction under the sexselection ban or 24week 
provision could mean up to seven years in prison and 15000 in 
fines 
the signing came on the same day that abortionrights supporters 
in congress announced their intention to push a bill that would 
write roe vs wade into law 
sponsors of that bill said their aim was to take the fight over 
rights to abortions away from state legislatures allowing them to 
impose only those restrictions that are medically necessary to 
protect the life or health of the mother 
meanwhile however spirits were high among pennsylvanias 
antiabortion activists rep stephen freind the pennsylvania 
republican who led the legislatures antiabortion fight called 
the new law a great victory 
it gives a tremendous shot in the arm to the national prolife 
movement and it may well be used as a vehicle for the supreme 
court to once again visit roe vs wade he said 
jenny daughtry executive director of the national abortion 
rights league pennsylvania chapter criticized the bill as cruel 
and demeaning and a direct attack on womens constitutional 
rights 
governor caseys signature on this bill is an affront to the 
health welfare and interest of all pennsylvanians pennsylvanians 
will express their outrage over this attack on their rights at the 
voting booth next november she said 
casey a democrat is expected to seek reelection next year

the house passed legislation friday that would 
exclude payments from an agent orange lawsuit settlement from the 
income measure used to determine eligibility for federal programs 
without such legislation veterans who received money from a 
civil court settlement with the makers of the herbicide agent 
orange will continue to lose or suffer a reduction in food stamps 
supplemental security income and other federal benefits 
the senate passed a companion measure june 9 and fridays voice 
vote sends the measure to the white house for the presidents 
signature 
a classaction suit was brought by veterans or their survivors 
against the makers of agent orange a dioxincontaminated herbicide 
used to remove ground cover in vietnam 
under the settlement approved in us district court in 
brooklyn in july 1988 the manufacturers agreed to pay 180 million 
to totally disabled veterans who whose health problems inluding 
cancers and birth defects in their offspring resulted from 
exposure 
the court estimated the average payment per veteran would be 
5700 over six years or 950 a year the maximum individual 
payment is 12800 
earlier legislation had eliminated means testing for eligibility 
for veterans programs the new legislation deals with the host of 
other assistance programs provided by the government 
the veterans affairs department has yet to grant disability 
benefits for veterans suffering from agent orange exposure on 
grounds there is no proof of a connection and no way to determine 
who was exposed 
va has begun reexamining that stance as the result of a court 
order in san francisco last may

the afghan government keeps prisoners 
penned like animals in deplorable cells forced to stand or 
squat for up to seven months while they await trial according to a 
un human rights investigator 
malnutrition and infant mortality meanwhile are running 
rampant in areas held by the islamic rebels and in their refugee 
camps in pakistan reported felix ermacora a special 
representative of the un commission on human rights 
both sides are using weapons against civilians and any such 
use must be qualified as terrorism he said 
ermacora visited afghanistan pakistan and iran in september and 
october to review human rights conditions and the plight of 
refugees from the 10yearold afghan war 
in kabul he found opponents of the regime are still being 
tried by special security courts and the procedural guarantees of 
the accused are not in conformity with international human rights 
instruments 
ermacora said there are still more than 3000 political 
prisoners in afghanistan and the conditions of those awaiting 
trial are deplorable 
they are kept like animals in small cells or rooms where they 
have to stand or squat for an unspecified period of time often as 
long as seven months behind iron bars often with insufficient 
light he said 
ermacora also found what he said were serious human rights 
violations by the islamic rebels who call themselves the 
mujahedeen or holy warriors 
he criticized the rebels for their use of usmade cluster 
bombs each of which contains 97 smaller time bombs they 
constitute one of the most frightening types of weapon currently 
being used in the conflict 
in rebelheld areas and in their camps in pakistan ermacora 
said he was informed of increasing cases of malnutrition in 
particular among the children due to food shortages 
he said 80 percent of the women and children seeking treatment 
at the kuwaiti hospital for afghans in peshawar are suffering 
from malnutrition 
ermacora estimated 5 million afghans have become refugees most 
of them in pakistan or iran 
the 23 million afghan refugees in iran mostly live in the major 
cities where they are integrated into the population and hold jobs 
he said 
they are in much better condition than the refugees in pakistan 
or the displaced afghans still in their own country who generally 
live in overcrowded camps with little opportunity to become 
selfreliant he said

astronomers have discovered a gigantic 
collection of galaxies that they say is the biggest structure ever 
seen in the universe 
the structure which they call the great wall is so difficult 
to explain that it raises new questions about theories of the 
origin and structure of the universe 
the researchers reported their discovery in fridays issue of 
the journal science 
the galaxies that make up the great wall form a sheet that is at 
least 500 million light years long or 3000 billion billion miles 
and it is 200 million light years wide and 15 million light years 
thick 
by comparison the earths milky way galaxy is 100000 light 
years across the entire universe is thought to be between 10 
billion and 20 billion light years across 
the great wall was discovered by margaret geller and john huchra 
of the harvardsmithsonian center for astrophysics in cambridge in 
a detailed threedimensional map they have been compiling of a 
section of the heavens the structure is so big that it appears to 
run off the edges of the map 
geller said no one knows of a force that could have produced a 
structure so big in the time since the universe was formed 
my view is its something really missing something we really 
dont understand said geller its not just a more complex 
version of something we already know 
astronomers say each new survey of skies turns up still bigger 
structures 
this is the latest chapter in a saga thats been going on 
since the late 1970s said edwin turner of princeton university 
we keep being surprised that we keep seeing something bigger as 
we go out farther 
he said theories about how the universe arrived in its current 
form already have been stretched by earlier discoveries and it is 
not clear whether the great wall will be the straw that broke the 
camels back virtually all current theories hold that the 
universe began with a big bang about 15 billion years ago and 
expanded rapidly into a highly uniform mix of matter and energy 
in their report the cambridge scientists suggested building a 
national observatory to extend the exploration of the universe 
they proposed a telescope with a lightgathering mirror four 
meters or 160 inches across giving it six times the 
lightgathering power of the telescope used to find the great wall 
with a telescope that size you can not only look nearby but 
you can look at large enough distances where you can begin to see 
how these structures really evolve geller said thats one 
thing we really have in our favor that as we look out to greater 
distances we look back in time

a gas explosion and fire in a coal 
mine friday trapped workers nearly a halfmile underground and 
about 90 miners were feared dead the tanjug news agency reported 
it said 73 miners had escaped unharmed 
a methane gas explosion and fire erupted at noon at the 
aleksinacki rudnici mine 120 miles south of belgrade as equipment 
was being welded in a shaft about 2300 feet underground mine 
director branislav mandusic told tanjug 
the state news agency quoted him as saying flames blocked the 
mines main access shaft and it was believed the miners perished 
because of poisonous fumes 
white smoke rising from the mine was visible from a distance of 
at least one mile late friday and police kept relatives and 
reporters well away from the pit which is one mile outside the 
town of aleksinac 
rescue teams including special units from other mines in the 
region were trying to extinquish the fire and reach the site of 
the disaster 
tanjug reported mandusic said all of the miners were equipped 
with oxygen tanks but in the exceptionally grave circumstances 
these could not be used he did not elaborate 
mandusic said 73 miners left the pit safely but they worked in 
a different part of the mine earlier reports had said 104 miners 
were trapped by the flames 
a methane explosion at the same mine in 1983 killed 38 workers 
scores of people including relatives of the missing miners 
gathered in freezing temperatures to await news of the missing 
miners several survivors agreed there was little hope for their 
trapped colleagues 
the fire is still burning and the temperatures were too high 
for us to get all the way through said zivorad stojisavljevic a 
member of the rescue team 
coal dust and methane gas are still burning fiercely and it 
could take a long time to put it out said another rescuer 
slobodan stefanovic who was carrying breathing equipment 
yugoslavias worst coal mining accidents were at the bosnian 
mine at kakanj and both were blamed on explosions of methane gas 
in 1934 an explosion and fire killed 127 miners and 128 miners 
were killed in 1965

among poles the editorial staff of the largest polish daily 
newspaper outside poland 
he got the usual heros welcome at nowy dziennik a 10foot 
banner over the entrance to the midtown manhattan building 
resounding applause as he entered the reception room a plaque and 
even a rubystudded 18karat gold ring from a polishamerican 
jeweler 
the ring was big and polands bestknown citizen received it 
with the usual string of jokes 
i like it a lot he said it looks very pretty and its 
very heavy so it speaks a lot about the greatness of walesa 
the 50 or so people in the room laughed walesa looking 
fatigued then begged for the gifts and praise to end for some 
poletopole talk 
how did you feel in congress 
oh my god he said to another chorus of mirth 
the gdansk shipyard worker whose deft negotiating skills helped 
turn a labor movement into the political force that dominates 
polands government took his nowfamiliar im just a simple 
electrician tack 
i have a complex standing next to all those greats he said 
of the political figures he met in washington walesa has said he 
was weakkneed during his address wednesday to a joint session of 
congress 
but you too are great offered boleslaw wierzbianski 
longtime publisher of the 23000circulation nowy dziennik daily 
news 
the paper has worked hard on solidaritys behalf raising about 
200000 for the spring electoral campaign that led to the free 
trade union movements victory in all but one of the races in which 
it fielded a candidate 
when he arrived walesa thanked the staff for all its efforts 
but asked them not to expect wisdom 
this is my 10th meeting today so im worn out and im going 
to speak to you without any deep thought he said for the first 
time all week a translator was not needed 
walesa squirmed out of an answer when asked what three things he 
would do first to revive his countrys devastated economy im 
not the government im lech walesa who makes connections 
when asked if he didnt fear that the solidarityled government 
would alienate the very workers who have been its core of support 
by closing down huge obsolete factories he presented his vision of 
polands future 
i must open tens of thousands of small manufacturers butcher 
shops bakeries he said that would offer people more than they 
currently are paid working for stateowned enterprises 
with foreign investors pouring in to do business well solve 
the problem he said well turn the old factories into museums 
to marxismleninism 
one questioner asked walesa why he had not yet found a half hour 
to talk to the thousands of poles in new york who not only have 
sent millions of dollars to poland but also voted for solidarity in 
the june elections 
walesa appeared a bit hurt but defended his priority for his 
first visit to the united states meeting with bankers 
industrialists and politicians in search of direly needed 
investment our political victory will be for naught if i dont 
cement it economically he said 
i apologize to the workers added walesa who was to take

a rare document in which george washington 
proclaimed the nations first thanksgiving holiday 200 years ago 
was recently discovered and went on display friday 
the proclamation dated oct 3 1789 is one of 13 president 
washington sent to the states but it is the only original known to 
exist today said herman darvick a new york auctioneer of 
autographs and historical documents who confirmed its authenticity 
peter f paul president of the nonprofit american spirit 
foundation said he found the proclamation among a collection of 
his mothers historical documents and maps about a month ago 
i was so moved by it when i read it i asked around and 
learned this really is something extraordinary paul said 
in his proclamation washington called for a day of public 
thanksgiving and prayer to give thanks to god for giving americans 
an opportunity peaceably to establish a form of government for 
their safety and happiness 
the 18by26inch document was put on display friday at the 
huntington library a prestigious institution in san marino 
calif a los angeles suburb with it is a letter signed by 
washington that was sent with the proclamation to gov thomas 
mifflin of pennsylvania 
mary robertson curator of manuscripts at the huntington said 
the museum tries to highlight holidays with historical displays 
this was a little bit unusual in that its a rare 
proclamation she said 
darvick confirmed the documents authenticity based on 
comparisons of the paper size and printing quality with other 
government proclamations of the period he estimated it is worth 
between 80000 and 100000 
but both darvick and paul said the documents real value lies in 
what it can teach americans on the 200th anniversary of the holiday 
not many americans know where thanksgiving originated paul 
said its one of the most moving and articulate documents to be

former philippines first lady imelda marcos is 
under government orders not to leave the island of oahu but she 
plans to go to san francisco next month to help prepare her 
defense her attorney said friday 
the us government cannot interfere with her right to assist 
in her defense and i dont believe they have any interest in doing 
that san francisco attorney john bartko said in a telephone 
interview 
mrs marcos faces federal criminal fraud and racketeering 
charges and her trial is scheduled to begin march 14 in new york 
her husband exiled former philippine president ferdinand marcos 
faced the same charges but died sept 28 
they were accused of siphoning nearly 200 million from their 
countrys treasury and stashing it in the united states 
mrs marcos has lived here since february 1986 when a popular 
revolt ended her husbands 20year rule and sent them into exile 
she is under an immigration and naturalization service order 
that prohibits her from leaving the hawaiian island of oahu she is 
also required to meet weekly with a probation officer 
bartko said he was in the process of submitting a formal 
request to us authorities to allow the trip and said he was 
confident it would be granted 
theyll want to know where she is who shes with where shes 
staying bartko said shell have to check in but thats not a 
problem 
bartko said mrs marcos needed to review more than 300000 
prosecution documents her defense team has compiled she would also 
help compile witness lists review testimony and generally prepare 
for her trial 
bartko said mrs marcos also might seek to meet with attorneys 
in new york and that no return date was set 
the government turned over an additional 6000 documents last 
week and the defense has petitioned prosecutors for more he said 
the sheer task of understanding all of the documents demands 
more than putting this stuff in your briefcase and flying to 
hawaii bartko said 
it would be mrs marcos first trip to the mainland since her 
october 1988 arraignment in new york she pleaded innocent and was 
freed on 5 million bail 
donald radcliffe the ins district director here said the 
request must be submitted at least two days before the planned 
departure he refused to say if he thought it would be approved 
roger peyuan mrs marcos spokesman said she would stay with 
her daughter irene araneta in woodside calif and hoped to be 
back in honolulu by christmas 
bartko refused to discuss any defense team negotiations with 
government prosecutors 
i just wouldnt tell you about that he said for those 
negotiations to be productive they must be kept private

conservatives and leftists jockeyed 
friday to form alliances for a runoff election next month and 
officials worked to finish counting the votes from the first round 
of balloting 
conservative fernando collor de mello led the 21candidate field 
with 276 percent of wednesdays vote the superior electoral court 
said with 6428 percent of the ballots counted 
collor de mello of the centerright national reconstruction 
party appeared to have guaranteed first place in the first free 
balloting for president since a 21year military regime ended in 
1985 
in the runoff dec 17 he appeared likely to face off with one 
of two leftist candidates who battled for the no 2 spot 
rep luis inacio lula da silva of the radical left workers 
party was in second place with 164 percent leonel brizola of 
the centerleft democratic labor party was third with 141 percent 
however more than half the votes from the heavily populated 
southern states of rio de janeiro and rio grande do sul brizola 
strongholds had not yet entered the governments computers the 
superior electoral court said in a statement 
collor de mello reportedly was seeking support on the left to 
shake an image as the representative of conservatives and the 
wealthy he has made contacts with top advisors of sen mario 
covas the candidate of the leftcenter brazilian social democracy 
party who was running a strong fourth 
anyone we eventually negotiate with must be committed to our 
program which gives priority to industrial development economic 
growth a fairer distribution of income social welfare and 
strengthening the domestic market collor de mello said in a 
televised interview at his home in brasilia the capital 
brizola and lula pledged to forget the personal rivalry that 
marked the campaign and support the winner of their battle for the 
second spot 
brizolas political advisor rep vivaldo barbosa said the 
candidate would seek alliances with all progressive forces and 
with lucid conservatives 
workers party president rep luiz gushiken said the party would 
hold a national convention nov 25 to discuss alliances 
we will deepen the ideological debate and show that collor is 
the candidate of the right he said 
as brazilians awaited the outcome financial markets reflected 
uneasiness 
on thursday the rio stock market fell 10 points with news of an 
advance by lula a former union boss who has scared businessmen 
with promises to nationalize banks and limit profits

abortionrights supporters in congress 
setting the stage for a political battle next year announced their 
intention friday to push a bill that would write into law the 1973 
supreme court ruling that legalized abortion 
the bill they introduced would in effect overcome the supreme 
courts decision last summer in the socalled webster case that 
gave states greater authority to impose restrictions on abortions 
supporters said 
just a few lines long the bill would forbid states from 
restricting a womans right to have an abortion before the time her 
fetus becomes viable for life outside the womb or at any time when 
necessary to protect the life or health of the mother 
sponsors said their aim was to take the fight over rights to 
abortions away from state legislatures allowing them to impose 
only those restrictions that are medically necessary to protect the 
life or health of the mother 
although no action was expected until next year abortionrights 
backers said the bill would become the central focus of future 
congressional and political debate on the abortion issue 
a result they said would be to thrust the abortion issue even 
further into the politics of the 1990 house and senate races 
this bill is the moral equivalent for women of the 1964 civil 
rights act said rep les aucoin dore 
a leader of the abortion opponents rep christopher smith 
rnj said he welcomed the bill because it would bring a full 
debate on abortion he said he was confident the house would defeat 
it 
i hope they bring the bill to the floor very quickly he 
said the question will then be very squarely will we permit 
abortion on demand for the whole nine months of pregnancy 
the house bill had 88 sponsors and a version introduced in the 
senate carried 19 sponsors 
the bill was aimed at writing into law the landmark 1973 roe vs 
wade decision establishing a womans right to an abortion and at 
reversing the webster case abortionrights supporters contend the 
webster decision eroded rights established 16 years earlier and 
signaled a possible further erosion in future highcourt decisions 
the webster decision however has energized abortionrights 
leaders and raised the temperature of the abortion debate in many 
states democrats won elections in new jersey and virginia last 
week in outcomes credited to increasing public sentiment for 
abortion rights 
on the other hand the pennsylvania legislature passed a bill 
imposing new restrictions on abortion including requirements for a 
24hour waiting period and that women notify their husbands 
beforehand gov robert p casey signed the bill into law on friday 
the webster decision forced us to go back to the legislative 
basics said rep vic fazio dcalif now the focus is on the 
basic right i look forward to this being the centerpiece of the 
abortion fight next year 
this bill is going to be the rallying point said rep 
claudine schneider rri an abortionrights supporter who met 
with president bush on the issue this week and who is weighing a 
1990 race for the senate bush is appearing at a fundraising event 
for her monday despite their differences on abortion 
sen robert packwood rore predicted passage by both the 
house and senate but acknowledged supporters would probably not be 
able to override a presidential veto 
abortionrights supporters in the senate on thursday ended their 
efforts to overcome bushs veto of a bill that would extend 
medicaid abortions to women who are victims of rape or incest both 
the house and senate agreed to provisions keeping the current 
prohibition on federal payment for abortions except in cases where 
the life of the mother is endangered 
both sides also were watching to see whether bush would sign or 
veto a spending bill for the district of columbia he vetoed an 
earlier version because it permitted federal financing of abortions 
in cases of rape incest or danger to the life of the mother 
congress passed a new version that prohibits use of federal funds 
except to save the mothers life but would permit the city to use 
its own funds in all other cases 
if he signs it it will be a victory for us aucoin said

president bush on friday signed a bill that 
will raise the minimum wage from 335 to 425 an hour by the 
spring of 1991 formally accepting the compromise that ended a year 
of disagreement with congressional democrats and organized labor 
bush praised the measure which he said would protect jobs and 
put more money into the pockets of our workers but sen edward 
m kennedy dmass said it merely marked progress to the 
50yard line on the issue 
the increase the first since 1981 would bring the wage to 
425 an hour by april 1991 after going to an intermediate 380 
on april 1 1990 
the new law also includes a lower training wage for new 
workers who are teenagers a provision sought by bush but 
initially opposed by congressional democrats 
bush in june vetoed a bill that would have increased the minimum 
wage to 455 over three years 
at an oval office signing ceremony attended by congressional 
leaders and sponsors bush called the new act a good example of 
what we can do in the future on other matters 
i have called for an increase in the minimum wage that would 
protect jobs and put more money into the pockets of our workers in 
my view this bill does exactly that im pleased to sign it 
bush said 
however kennedy dmass who supported a higher minimum said 
after the ceremony i think weve arrived on the 50yard line on 
this 
its not as much as the working poor deserve but it was a 
real compromise and it brought the presidents position to one of 
not saying take it or leave it kennedy chairman of the senate 
labor and human resources committee told reporters 
kennedy said a democraticled effort to boost the wage further 
in 1992 a presidential election year was a live option 
under terms of the new law young people 16to19 years old who 
have never worked could be paid 85 percent of the minimum wage for 
90 days employers with a training plan in place could pay the 
young workers a training rate for 90 days more 
the training wage can be paid to workers 1619 years old for 
their first three months of work experience and for three 
additional months provided they are in certified training programs 
the training wage would be 335 an hour after next april 1 
when the minimum wage increases to 425 a year later the 
subminimum would increase to 361 an hour the provision allowing 
for the subminimum expires in april 1993 unless extended by 
congress 
bush called for a 425 minimum wage during his campaign 
also at the signing ceremony were labor secretary elizabeth 
dole senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine house 
speaker thomas s foley dwash senate minority leader bob dole 
rkan house minority leader robert michel rill house majority 
leader richard gephardt dmo rep austin murphy dpa and rep

bernstein also said it has been called to my attention that 
in declining the onceaccepted invitation to lunch at the white 
house i may have offended my hostess in which case i sincerely 
apologize to mrs bush

had done so after viewing the exhibition witnesses against our 
vanishing 
as he read the awards citation in the east room of the white 
house on friday frohnmayer made no mention of the controversy

complexity of life in todays america 
eisenstaedt who is 90 was not at the ceremony and his award 
was accepted for him 
the president and mrs bush shook hands with each recipient 
art defines our civilization said the president you can 
see and hear and even feel life through the mind of someone else 
for new perspectives instead of seeing a single world we can see 
as many worlds as there are artists writers dancers and

the assassination of six 
jesuits thursday was the latest attack against their order in latin 
america where conservatives have viewed them as dangerous 
revolutionaries for the past two centuries 
it was not the first attack on the society of jesus in this 
massachusettssized country which is wracked by a decadeold civil 
war that has claimed more than 70000 lives 
the revs ignacio ellacuria rector of jose simeon canas central 
american university vicerector ignacio martinbaro and educators 
amado lopez juan ramon moreno and joaquin lopez lopez were slain 
and mutilated early thursday 
two witnesses said government soldiers in uniform were involved 
according to the rev jose maria tojeira the jesuit orders 
superior for central america the government denied the charges 
the jesuit university one of the regions most prestigious 
institutions of education had been the target of two previous 
attacks this year 
on april 29 and july 22 bombs exploded at the entrance of the 
university and in the printing shop where it publishes its academic 
tracts and monthly review of social and political issues 
no one was injured in those two bombings but damage to property 
was considerable the university blamed rightist elements within 
the military 
this attack is the latest in a long chain constantly incited 
by an insidious campaign of calumny and libel against this 
institution and the jesuits who work here said a statement put 
out by the university july 22 
once more physical violence follows moral violence and the 
bomb is precipitated by libelous accusation the impunity and 
treachery with which these deeds are done cannot hide the 
responsibility of those who incite them pay for them and cover 
them up the statement added 
the april and july bomings followed publication in rightist 
newspapers of several private advertisements labeling ellacuria 
martinbaro and montes apologists for leftist rebels of the 
farabundo marti national liberation front 
in 1977 the rev rutilio grande another jesuit was slain by 
a rightist death squad as he drove to the poor rural parish of 
aguilares where he was teaching people to fight for civic and 
human rights 
attacks and criticism of the society of jesus one of the 
continents most controversial and socially active groups date 
back to the spanish colonial times 
in 1767 the vatican pressured by south american landowners and 
businessmen expelled the jesuits from the continent as a result of 
their theocraticsocialist missionary work among indians in 
what today is paraguay 
in recent years the liberation theology movement has been 
viewed as subversive by conservatives in power in latin america in 
many countries jesuits have been in the fore of the movement which 
expresses a preferential option for the poor

increased chemical attacks on pockets of 
cropthreatening mediterranean fruit flies are drawing fire from 
politicians and environmentalists citing potential health risks 
discovery of a fertilized medfly in a previously unaffected san 
fernando valley suburb prompted agriculture officials to schedule 
aerial pesticide spraying over the infested 12squareblock area 
next monday 
spraying with the pesticide malathion also was planned thursday 
night for a 22squaremile swath of east los angeles and the san 
gabriel valley with a second application over the same area 
scheduled in two weeks 
city councilman richard alatorre who represents an infested 
district wrote a letter to state food and agricultural director 
henry voss stating fears about the pesticide 
clearly the mediterranean fruit fly is a serious menace to 
the welfare of this region and ultimately the state alatorre 
wrote it is equally clear however that one of the weapons used 
in the battle to eradicate this menace malathion is itself of 
questionable safety to the health of humans exposed to it 
a protest was planned monday by the green party a political 
group that stresses environmental issues 
the greens intend to put pressure on public officials to 
outright ban the use of malathion said party chairman randall 
toler the group is calling for the use of sterile medflies instead 
of pesticides to battle the infestation he said 
toler said agriculture officials were caught flatfooted 
without adequate supplies of sterile medflies he said the 
cancercausing potential of malathion remains under review by the 
federal government 
the sterile flies were normally released after sprayings to 
breed any remaining pests out of existence 
a county official and a spokesman for gov george deukmejian 
defended malathions use against the medfly which lays its eggs in 
more than 250 varieties of fruits and vegetables threatening the 
states 14billionayear agriculture industry 
we feel strongly that the doses that are sprayed are not going 
to cause any health problems said carol ward spokeswoman for 
the los angeles county department of health services she said less 
than an ounce of malathion is spayed per acre 
governor george deukmejian fully supports current efforts 
and believes that the public is supportive because of the clear 
damage that the medfly can bring to californias top industry 
said his spokesman kevin m brett

the us supreme court rejected a final 
appeal from a man who was slated to be executed at 1201 am 
friday for raping and murdering his cousin while on an 8hour pass 
from a prison workrelease center in 1978 
the high court refused by a 72 vote late thursday afternoon to 
spare the life of arthur james julius justices william j brennan 
and thurgood marshall who oppose capital punishment in all 
circumstances supported julius emergency plea for a stay of 
execution 
julius 43 was condemned to die in the electric chair at holman 
prison for raping and strangling his cousin 29yearold susie bell 
sanders at her montgomery home he was serving a life term for a 
1972 murder at the time of the violent sexual assault 
defense attorney tommy goggans of montgomery argued in 
lastditch attempts to halt the execution that the prosecution 
withheld evidence during julius trial in montgomery but a federal 
district judge and a federal appeals court rejected the plea before 
goggans took it to the supreme court 
in january julius received a stay of execution less than 48 
hours before he was scheduled to die in the electric chair on that 
occasion gov guy hunt denied clemency pleas saying he would not 
interfere with the verdict of the judicial system 
according to court records julius left on an 8hour pass from 
draper prisons workrelease center at 11 am on jan 29 1978 
and borrowed a relatives car from 330 pm to 625 pm during 
that time according to court records julius turned ms sanders 
apartment into a shambles beating her and dragging her though 
rooms and subjecting her to grotesque sexual abuse before 
strangling her 
her nude body was discovered by her 5yearold daughter 
the victims parents told reporters in january that the 
execution was long overdue her father has since died family 
members declined comment when contacted by phone this week 
the last person executed in alabama was herbert lee richardson 
who was put to death aug 18 for the pipebomb slaying of a dothan 
child his was the sixth execution in the state since the us 
supreme court reinstated the death penalty in 1972

for all of mikhail s gorbachevs reforms the 
soviet health system with its ossified bureaucracy confused new 
directives backward industry and lack of funds remains unable to 
fill an array of health needs 
this was evident recently at a gathering of 10 core members of 
the newly formed moscow diabetes association 
one member larisa krupinyova said a specialist had recommended 
that her diabetic son roman be given a highquality insulin 
i said fine where do i get it she told the group she 
told me thats your problem 
around the small circle heads nodded in empathy 
elvira gustova mother of a 15yearold diabetic said that in 
five years she has been able to buy only 50 strips used for the 
bloodsugar tests that are supposed to be taken daily 
pravda the communist party newspaper reported recently that 
president gorbachev had told a meeting of the partys ruling 
politburo the medicine shortage was so severe it had become a 
political problem that should be taken under tough party 
control 
he had previously denounced what he called the mismanagement 
that fuels shortages of pharmaceuticals and equipment he also 
singled out by name the officials he said ordered millions of 
disposable syringes without ensuring there would be needles to go 
with them babies and children in several soviet hospitals have 
contracted aids from unsterilized needles 
the government recently pledged an additional 781 million to 
buy imported medications in all the soviet union expects to spend 
about 32 billion from its precious hardcurrency reserves to 
import medicines this year but pravda said the situation still is 
not improving 
speakers at the politburo meeting blamed the soviet 
pharamaceutical industry for the shortage as well as the refusal 
of several localities to allow new chemical factories to be built 
within them 
alexei moskvichev head of moscows health services estimated 
that only 400 of the 2800 permissable medications are in short 
supply in the soviet union and said he knew of no deaths brought on 
by the lack of a particular medication 
if i knew it was needed it would be obtained somehow whether 
by plane from europe or otherwise he said in an interview 
but the soviet press imparts a bleaker picture 
a recent article headlined why are children dying in the 
newspaper sovietskaya kultura described how the lack of proper 
medicine in soviet drugstores led to a rise in infant mortality 
the government newspaper izevstia advised in a headline 
youre sick breathe deeper 
the labor newspaper trud titled a story the shortage that 
costs lives 
we can get along without meat and sausage retiree s 
katayev wrote in a letter to pravda and we can even live with 
just 15 kilograms 3 pounds of sugar a month we wont die from 
that but we cant get along without medical help 
the longest line at the biggest pharmacy in the soviet union 
leads to the information booth where people try to find out where 
they can get the medicine they need if they can get it at all 
on a recent afternoon in pharmacy no 1 anfisa kremlyova a 
retired doctor came away from the information window emptyhanded 
she had been told no drugstore in the district had the 
anticoagulant or sedative she needed ill just have to search 
some more she said 
sometimes there are scenes said tamara pogromova assistant 
director of the pharmacy a short walk from red square after all 
people have to get cured 
this past spring recalled rima goffman whose grandson has 
diabetes there was an insulin panic and calls started pouring in 
saying supplies of topgrade imported insulin were getting 
dangerously low 
members of the moscow diabetes association appealed to moscows 
communist party committee the party chiefs pressured the health 
ministry and within two weeks supplies improved 
that was a battle won but it cost health and tears and 
nerves goffman said 
in some ways things are better now if not for gorbachevs 
reforms the moscow diabetes association would never have been 
allowed to form gain official recognition and push its own 
interests 
but the gorbachev years have also witnessed a drop in reserves 
of hard currency and dwindling supplies of everything from soap to 
socks with medicine increasingly hard to get especially imported 
medicine 
diabetes association members took turns telling tales of woe for 
more than two hours at their meeting 
they complained that there are virtually no bloodsugar 
measuring devices in soviet hospitals that there is a shortage of 
specialists and most of those who do practice are poorly trained 
that it is difficult to get the kinds of food diabetics need that 
when diabetics are hospitalized they often get hepatitis from 
contaminated needles or suffer more due to the poor diet 
igor rivkin whose son has diabetes said gorbachevs reforms 
eventually may improve conditions but the problems are so deep 
they cant be solved right away and you cant conserve the patient 
until they improve every day every hour the disease does its 
work

more than 400 art deco furnishings and objects from 
one of the worlds largest private collections go to the auction 
block next month in what experts are calling the sale of the season 
the collection estimated at about 10 million includes a pair 
of gilded bronze fire dogs sculpted by gustav miklos 14 lacquer 
panels by jean dunand and 66 pieces of furniture crafted by master 
cabinetmaker emilejacques ruhlmann 
there is no collection like this in private hands anywhere in 
the world said auctioneer jacques tajan who is to hold the 
gavel on dec 13 at the hotel georges v the objects can be 
previewed nov 2730 at the theatre des champs elysees 
the collection was assembled over 25 years by alain lesieutre a 
59yearold former dealer who admits hed rather buy than sell 
lesieutre said parting with his treasures among the worlds 
rarest and most beautiful objects from the 1930s is not easy 
yes its a heartbreak to see my house emptied of all these 
things he said in an interview at his left bank apartment which 
looks more like a museum than a private home but its a chance 
for me to pursue my other passions which are collecting paintings 
from 1890 to 1950 
lesieurtre was among the first french collectors to appreciate 
art deco in his the spirit and splendour of art deco 
published by paddington press ltd he described the style as the 
last attempt made in europe to create a fullblooded perfectly 
coherent decorative style with its own completeness its own 
internal logic and its own dream 
i love the quality of the materials and the purity of the 
lines he said at its best the furniture has the clean 
simple grace of the louis xvi style without the fussiness 
the collection includes a oneofakind coiffeuse and a rolltop 
desk in makassar ebony bordered wtih ivory inlay both by ruhlmann 
art deco aficionados will love the gold jewelry by surrealist 
artist max ernst glassware by galle and daum drop necklaces by 
lalique and bellshaped tiffany lamps 
art deco designers were way ahead of their times the design of 
lesieutres eggshaped chairs by carlo bugatti was a forerunner of 
forms that came of age in the 1960s 
art deco reached its culmination in the 1925 exposition des arts 
decoratifs scheduled originally to take place in 1914 and called 
off because of world war i the show also gave the style its name 
the delay gave art deco time to mature and prosper ebony 
ivory shagreen rawhide leather lacquer enamel were the 
preferred materials of art deco artists and craftsmen who tried to 
get rid of the gilded prettiness of earlier styles as they 
sought a more massive opulence with a cleancut simplicity 
lesieutre admits that he may never get over his passion for art 
deco 
im putting my gorgeous ruhlmann card table in the sale but 
since im a gin fanatic i need another card table what did i buy 
another ruhlmann he said

the riots on st croix that followed hurricane 
hugo and the racial unrest that threatens this city today grew 
from centuriesold seeds sown in a paradoxical region as detailed 
in james a micheners latest novel caribbean 
the pulitzer prizewinning author spent three years traveling 
among the chain of lovely jewels and researched more than 400 
books to put together a 667page novel that chronicles more than 
six centuries of civilization and destruction in the region 
the idyllic portrait is only partly true said michener 82 
as he and his wife mari prepared to set sail on a farewell cruise 
to the islands he described in his book 
there were undoubtedly fine blackwhite relationships and many 
were friendly and yet each one of the islands had eight or 10 
insurrections he said theres a dichotomy there that i think 
we all are engaged in 
michener explores the contradictions of the region using his 
patented blend of fact and fiction historical figures such as 
christopher columbus adm horatio nelson fidel castro and gen 
toussaint louverture who outfoxed french spanish and british 
armies in what is now haiti brush against imaginary characters 
that range from a mayan priestess to a jamaican rasta 
how the caribbean islands can be so beautiful and yet so violent 
is the central question of the book in scene after scene men and 
women of ambition build dreams only to be crushed by tyrants 
in the short run brutality always wins it takes longer for 
amity to prevail he writes after describing how the carib 
indians cannibalized the primitive arawaks who as the islands 
first residents were satisfied with planting vegetables and 
watching the sun set each day 
the message resonates throughout the islands history 
demonstrating how the legacy of harsh colonial rule provides both a 
charm and a curse for the islands of today michener draws clear 
lines from the slave rebellions to contemporary scenes in which 
povertystricken blacks prey on tourists even though the visitors 
provide desperately needed cash to their island economies 
the history of this land and of all the islands spain has 
captured in this lovely sea will involve the slow and even 
reluctant admission that the big black man down there has a soul 
says a rather forwardlooking 16th century priest of micheners 
invention ruminating on the atrocities columbus ordered against 
indians and the oppression his descendents would force on slaves 
michener a lifelong quaker says he grew to love and fear for 
the people of the islands during his research which brought him to 
back streets and poorer areas american tourists rarely see on their 
caribbean vacations 
i see people beating their brains out to figure out what 
theyre going to do for money said michener who has several 
characters suggest all the islands would prosper if the united 
states inflated the price of caribbean cane sugar 
but because the us sugar industry wont allow it the region 
is headed for revolution or worse according to a haitianamerican 
professor who flees her island as a child and returns the same way 
michener did this week as a guest lecturer on a cruise ship 
so we stagger along toward a disaster whose timing we cannot 
predict but whose coming is inevitable were a fleet of 
magnificent islands lost in the sun she says in the book 
michener also examines miami the destination of refugees from 
every wave of unrest in the area through the eyes of a 
cubanamerican doctor trying to reconcile his two cultures 
the doctor admits that he and other white cubans secretly 
despise the cubans who came to florida later in the 1980 mariel 
boatlift because many of the newcomers are black and yet he 
despairs when his white nonlatin friends suffer hispanic 
panic and flee to palm beach 
michener who traveled to havana in search of a sugar plantation 
to describe in caribbean and cowrote six days in havana 
as a spinoff of the larger novel also sends the doctor to havana 
on a mission from president reagan to discuss normalizing relations 
between the united states and cuba 
the issue is considered incendiary in south floridas cuban 
exile community but micheners feelings are clear 
miami perched at the tip of a great continent striving to 
retain its anglosaxon character and havana located on the edge 
of a glorious island and determined to protect its spanish 
heritage they should have enjoyed a symbiotic relationship of 
mutual reward 
he blames the castro revolution for making intercourse between 
the two natural neighbors impossible to the grave detriment of 
each 
michener has published 36 books since winning the 1947 pulitzer 
prize for tales of the south pacific and despite a quintuple 
coronary bypass operation in 1986 and a hip replacement the next 
year he plans to keep working as a professor emeritus 
emeritus at the university of texas 
im feeling good im a little unsteady on my pins but i take 
a long walk every night said michener who swears he hasnt 
decided what the subject of his next book will be 
it will probably be a novel all fiction its a pretty big 
decision to jump into another book another state another society 
another set of problems and contradictions its really quite 
complicated

its been more than two years since garrison 
keillor left gentle lake wobegon but public radios favorite 
storyteller says hes not worried about stepping up to the 
microphone again even if the stage is in roughandtumble brooklyn 
i hope to become nervous you know at the right time i count 
on it said keillor who returns to the airwaves this month on a 
new weekly program but i hope that it doesnt raise the pitch in 
my voice i think im counted on to sing bass parts 
garrison keillors american radio company of the air which 
premieres on public radio stations nov 25 will once again feature 
keillors soft voice im going to sing just ever so slightly 
less than people would like me to 
but he insists the new live show will not be a continuation or 
spinoff of a prairie home companion which attracted 4 million 
listeners each week on american public radio 
what im doing is taking 13 years of experience doing one kind 
of live radio variety show in one place and im using that to 
create a different one a different one in a different place he 
said in a recent interview sitting behind a desk stacked with 
books at his manhattan office 
keillors plans for this seasons 20 shows include classic 
american music of all kinds from aaron copland to duke 
ellington country music to broadway singer eileen farrell 
pianist james tocco and opera star marilyn horne are scheduled to 
guest star 
and the humorist says his monologues will return but with less 
of a focus on the midwest 
ive a lot of things i want to talk about some of which have 
to do about new york or take place here he said but i dont 
have any need to do a routine on new york tell new york jokes 
will he be telling tales again about the norwegian bachelor 
farmers and other residents of the mythical minnesota town of lake 
wobegon 
i dont believe i will he says with a smile unless of 
course i heard something i would pass it on 
keillor 47 left his home base of st paul minn with his 
wife for denmark in 1987 and settled in manhattan later that same 
year 
since then he has done occasional specials for cable 
television appeared on tour with orchestras and continued to spin 
yarns about the town he made famous on the earlier show and in such 
bestsellers as lake wobegon days and leaving home 
keillors return to radio was sparked he says by an elderly 
georgia man he met during a trip last year to gettysburg pa 
he said when are you coming back and that was the first 
time anybody had asked me that question when are you coming 
back not are you or why dont you 
he just said when are you coming back i said pretty 
soon 
he also received encouragement from his wife ulla skaerved a 
career counselor shes a professional in this field of advising 
middleaged men on their career plans he said 
after discussions with minnesota public radio which also 
produced a prairie home companion keillor announced plans for 
his return in may 
he put together his company this summer after scores of 
auditions where he made a point of not looking at the performers 
i wanted to find radio actors who can also sing he said 
and i really was bowled over by the people who i got 
the brooklyn academy of music will house the show except for 
two weeks next year when it travels to st paul 
the urban neighborhood where the academy is located is a far cry 
from mildmannered st paul and keillor expects the house to be 
filled with a lot of people from connecticut and new jersey who 
will be uneasy thinking about the fact when the shows over 
itll be dark 
but he says well reassure them theyll be brave when they 
leave 
as for his friends back home he suggests they wait until hes 
able to put them up for the weekend before they come out to see the 
show 
they dont even want to know what hotel rates are people from 
lake wobegon he said i dont think they should even look into 
it

since early october 
the students who once did their artwork in the shade of the 
trees have organized protest marches to the governors mansion la 
fortaleza demanding reforestation of el morro 
conservation groups have taken up the cause which has provoked 
a stream of letters in the san juan star including one containing 
joyce kilmers most famous poem trees 
wp crawford the national park service superintendent in 
puerto rico said hugos 140mph winds left only few trees standing 
at el morro and most of the rest were too badly mangled to be saved 
taking them out was only thing to do he maintained 
besides crawford said a 1983 general management plan approved 
two years later by the us and commonwealth governments said the 
broad grassy slope leading to the fort should be treeless the way 
it was originally 
maybe with a superhuman effort some of the trees could have 
been saved he said but because the general management plan 
calls for removing all the trees i didnt think it was worth the 
time and effort of nursing a dozen or so along 
what we are trying to do is protect the historic scene as 
mandated by congress for all us historic sites crawford said 
the historical context has got to be no 1 by law 
archaeologist guy pantell who has asked the presidential 
advisory council on historic preservation in washington for an 
investigation said the historical argument did not justify the 
destruction of trees not damaged by the storm 
if this was so parts of el morro would have to be eliminated 
its construction occurred during several centuries pantell said 
in an interview with the star 
the walled fort which overlooks san juan harbor was built 
mostly between 1589 and the 1650s to guard the city against 
seaborne attack today it is by far puerto ricos most popular 
tourist attraction with 25 million visitors a year 
tourists approach el morros tiered batteries across a 200yard 
esplanade which is a popular place for picnics and flying kites 
historians say the esplanade was purposely kept clear of vegetation 
to give el morros defenders a clear line of fire 
but during the 1940s soldiers planted about 50 sea pines and 
coconut palms along the road in front of el morro which at that 
time had a us army officers club other trees were planted 
nearby on land controlled by the commonwealth government 
gov rafael hernandez colon who had endorsed the tree removal 
has reversed his position and appointed a committee to work out a 
compromise 
committee member enrique marti founder of the conservation 
group pro bosques urbanos or pro urban forests said the panel had 
agreed to selectively plant trees at el morro to keep the main 
esplanade clear he said the landscape would look better than it 
did before the hurricane 
but not everybody is satisfied 
our children will see the trees but we wont said lourdes

this may be a shock to anyone 
whos heard her soaring voice but singer maria mckee nearly quit 
the business just before recording her solo debut album 
i went through a lot of soulsearching before doing this 
album said the 25yearold mckee i had moments when i 
thought is this worth it i had moments of sheer desolation 
about it 
the depression stemmed from her experiences fronting lone 
justice a highly touted countryrock band from los angeles that 
fell far short of expectations 
plucked from the garages in time to put out a record in 1985 
lone justice found friends in high places jimmy iovine who 
produced john lennon sat behind the controls for them tom petty 
gave them a song u2 invited them on tour but neither of lone 
justices two records sold very well and the supposed cantmiss 
stars missed 
the experience scarred mckee but didnt fatally wound her her 
solo debut an amalgam of rock country and gospel filled with 
messages from the lovelorn isnt setting any sales records 
either but its been received with the kind of quiet respect for 
which mckee is longing 
ever since i was a little kid i wanted to have a rock n roll 
band to put a band together and be successful at it she said 
i had to let that go and realize that it wasnt going to happen 
i was beginning to wonder if i really wanted to make music 
like many rockers before her lone justice was disillusioned by 
the realization that the pop music merrygoround was controlling 
them instead of the other way around 
there was no way lone justice could live up to the advance 
billing she said 
the hype was so completely absurd without really the 
substance to back it up and thats very dangerous she said 
even if you are as great as everyone expects you to be it can 
never really work out because people like to discover for 
themselves something to like about your music 
she blamed the bands failure on the usual litany of rock n 
roll excuses bad chemistry between band members business naivete 
and a sense they were writing songs to fulfill the expectations of 
others instead of themselves 
mckee took some time off the band dispersed to various parts of 
the country but they didnt immediately learn their lessons lone 
justice actually regrouped and started work on a third album before 
mckee decided to pack it in 
the solo record is largely a collaboration with keyboardist 
bruce brody and producer mitchell froom with several session 
players added the sound is more sophisticated and airy than the 
lone justice records highlighting mckees extraordinary voice 
i wanted to have the freedom to write whatever i wanted to to 
record with whoever i wanted to she said it could be an 
acoustic band it could be a jug band it could be a string band 
maybe i took liberties that im too young to take or too 
inexperienced to take but i thought i should be honest with 
myself 
although the album sounds like its coming from a woman whose 
heart has been broken a few times mckee insists that isnt the 
case 
love is used as a metaphor for some of her career uncertainties 
during the song ive forgotten what it was in you that put the 
need in me 
im not really experienced in the art of love and all of 
that she said im sort of an idiot savant when it comes to 
love ive been on the road since i was 18 and i havent really had 
any boyfriends 
on compact disc the downer spell of her album is broken by the 
last song drinkin in my sunday dress the twisted tale of a 
hard drinking yet churchgoing woman features some of mckees most 
uninhibited vocals and a wild guitar that marc ribot plays with 
his car keys 
mckee said the song was left off the album because it didnt 
really fit the theme but its a highlight of her live shows she 
opened a series of dates for neil young this summer accompanied by 
brody and her acoustic guitar singing no lone justice songs 
although geffen records was initially concerned that her album 
didnt have a natural single mckee said shes not that worried 
about having hits a career role model for her now is elvis 
costello she said 
i really admire the way hes gone about it she said he 
makes album after album and some are better than others but hes 
always onto something hes always on the edge and always 
experimenting with n and new musicians and stretching his writing 
it 
after a few tours with lone justice s really didnt believe 
shes recaptured the sp music business in the first place 
mckeesalfway through her 20s 
im 25 years old and even though ive been doing this for 10 
years there was soof that time that was spent trying to figure out 
what i wanted to do she said now that i know im on the 
right track again

seated in his workshop where he has 
meticulously transformed elephant tusks into intricate ivory 
artwork for four decades wong cheonglam knows the days of his 
craft are numbered 
im the only one left he sighs looking around the the 
workshop where six carvers once worked 
the artwork crafted by the 55yearold wong and the 1200 or so 
other ivory carvers in hong kong has long been popular 
wholesalers from the united states europe and japan have 
eagerly snapped up tons of ivory worked in hong kong shop windows 
in tourist districts display works ranging from panormaic 
landscapes carved from an entire tusk to delicate earrings 
but now the centuriesold craft may be doomed 
in octber the convention on international trade in endangered 
species cites adopted a ban on world ivory trading to save 
africas dwindling elephant population which has dropped from 15 
million in the 1970s to an estimated 600000 now victims of 
poachers after their tusks 
the ban gives ivory traders until jan 18 to sell their stocks 
but hong kong companies say they will need much longer to sell 670 
tons of ivory the worlds largest known stockpile worth about 
128 million 
wong estimates the value of his own uncarved ivory at about 
25600 and said he has no idea what to do itll take at least 
five years to carve it all 
local traders are lobbying the government in this british colony 
to allow them to continue sales past the january deadline and are 
scrambling to figure out how to save their industry 
between the elephants and the carvers who do you think should 
be protected asked an angry dominic ng a leading ivory trader 
ng suggests the government forbid the import of more tusks but 
allow the carving and export of the existing stockpile until the 
ban is reviewed in 1991 by cites 
but since the united states japan and other major ivory import 
markets are upholding the ban it is not clear how much such a 
policy would help the industry in hong kong the only legal market 
for traders would be smaller countries that do not belong to cites 
or refuse to go along with the ban 
the hong kong government has indicated it will abide by the 
trade ban and officials are considering vocational training for 
carvers thrown out of work 
but wong is skeptical about retraining workers 
ivory carvers usually do not have much education he said 
it is too late for them to learn another skill and doing other 
odd jobs will barely make ends meet 
the government also has promised to seek support for the 
creation of an international fund to buy up the ivory stockpile in 
hong kong 
local traders are demanding compensation for their stockpile 
which they say consists of ivory that was purchased with approval 
by cites before it imposed the ban 
a government survey found 93 percent of the ivory in hong kong 
contains valid cites certification but conservationists argue much 
of the stockpile comes from the tusks of poached elephants that the 
convention has nonetheless allowed onto the market 
nicholas pirie chairman of the local branch of the royal 
society for the prevention of cruelty to animals says the hong 
kong ivory must be destroyed 
if ivory exports were permitted to continue it would be easy 
for more poached ivory to be smuggled into the colony and claimed 
as part of the original stockpile pirie argues 
i sympathize with the workers but i dont sympathize with the 
bosses he said 
at his workshop in an old residential building wong 
methodically works on a sixinchhigh elephant figure using a tiny 
drill to carve wrinkles in the animals feet the project will take 
up to three weeks 
such craftsmanship has been an integral part of chinese art for 
centuries but wong believes the long history of ivory carving in 
hong kong now the main center for such work is reaching an end 
with or without the ban 
who wants to learn how to carve ivory nowadays he said 
explaining it takes five years of apprenticeship and pays only 
about 500 a month

sculptor isabel mcilvain is closing in on the 
moment of truth for her 8foottall portrayal of john f kennedy 
her clay statue is about to be cast in bronze the final step 
before its unveiling outside the massachusetts capitol as the 
formal memorial to a beloved native son 
for older generations the heroic image will recall the optimism 
and vigor embodied by kennedy for generations born since the young 
president was slain on nov 22 1963 the statue offers a glimpse 
of the era known as camelot 
my wish is to portray somebody who was a magnetic leader and 
who had a lot of youth a lot of hope about his role and the 
possiblities for america said mcilvain a professor of sculpture 
at boston university 
mcilvains work which will take about six months to cast 
depicts kennedy in a classic pose striding into a breeze eyes 
forward elbows bent with his left hand tucked into his suit pocket 
there are some people who have the carriage but they are stiff 
and pompous where theres nothing stiff about kennedy said the 
artist who has spent thousands of hours studying her subject i 
think you can see the mans wit the glint of humor in his eye 
the finished 175000 sculpture which has been paid for through 
donations from citizens groups and schoolchildren is scheduled 
for unveiling may 29 which would have been kennedys 72nd birthday 
it will be displayed outside the statehouse near a statue of 
henry cabot lodge the republican whose son kennedy defeated in 
1952 in the us senate campaign that launched his national career 
the john f kennedy memorial commission was established by the 
state legislature in 1983 to create a suitable tribute the 
commission sponsored a yearlong competition for memorial designs 
which drew 300 entries from around the country 
judges debated the former presidents stance demeanor and 
whether both coat buttons should be buttoned the way kennedy 
preferred despite the dicates of style 
history and mcilvain won after it was established kennedy 
had indeed appeared in more than 200 photographs with his 
twobutton coat buttoned contrary to sartorial custom 
i tried to catch his spirit so its not my thinking imposed 
on him as much as its a reflection of him said mcilvain who 
won the commissions approval in april 1988 
he was an extremely charming man but i didnt want the 
superpolished stereotypical person she added citing again the 
hand in the pocket im sure his mother told him endlessly not to 
do it because it sags the pocket out but thats the real john 
kennedy

smirnoff vodka will be pitching a literacy 
campaign rather than bottles of booze this christmas 
tobacco beer and consumer products giant philip morris 
companies inc is spending 60 million on ads celebrating the bill 
of rights 
burger king corp dumped its regular fastfood ads over the past 
month and aired commercials appealing for money for disaster relief 
efforts 
whats going on here have these companies lost their heads 
shucking the pursuit of profit in an altruistic frenzy egged on by 
president bushs vision of a kinder and gentler society 
or have they discovered there is prestige to be gained 
attention to be grabbed and money to be made by linking their names 
to fashionable causes 
the answer may lie somewhere in between although some marketing 
experts warn that trying to use altruism as a screen for 
bottomline objectives risks a consumer backlash 
there is a limit to how much you can wrap yourself in the 
flag said mike hughes vice chairman and creative director at 
the marhat other liquor brands 
have used in their christmas ads he said backing a cause also 
would appeal to smirnoff drinkers traditional values 
smirnoff is contributing 100000 outright paying for ads that 
solicit donations and setting up special displays with a canister 
in liquor stores for contributions 
two of the groups 370 chapters in baltimore and charleston 
wva declined to participate saying they did not want to accept 
money from a liquor company 
its a hard choice to make when you are desperate for money 
said sister mary judith who heads the baltimore community group 
affiliated with literacy volunteers 
miamibased burger king already had begun promoting its bk 
double hamburgers when an earthquake struck the san francisco bay 
area last month 
chief executive barry gibbons told his admakers that burger king 
should give something back to communities struck by earthquakes 
and hurricanes the ads pledge to donate 25 cents to the red cross 
for each bk double sold through nov 23 
the appeal raised 3 million in the first two weeks of the 
fourweek promotion 
still the approach doesnt sit well with critics like hughes 
while what burger king was doing was good it wasnt 
completely noble when they told me i had to buy a whopper he 
said

foreseeing another takeover battle avon 
products inc has issued a declaration of war against a crop of 
raiders and pledged to fight for the cosmetics companys 
continued independence 
avon has beaten back three unsolicited takeover efforts in the 
last year we were prepared to fight to keep avon independent then 
and were prepared to fight again the companys board of 
directors said thursday in a letter to shareholders 
the letter to be published in newspapers across the country on 
friday was released in advance by the new yorkbased direct sales 
company it attempts to slam the door shut on an investment group 
that recently disclosed it owns 69 percent of avon stock and may 
consider making a takeover proposal 
the group a limited partnership called chartwell associates 
includes a senior executive of mary kay corp the privately held 
parent of doortodoor marketer mary kay cosmetics others in the 
investment alliance include the gordon p getty family trust and 
the fisher real estate family of new york 
the avon board blasted the group for engaging in double talk 
by promising not to merge avon with dallasbased mary kay nor to 
join the two companies sales forces 
this crop of raiders says it has no intention of merging avon 
with mary kay or otherwise interfering with the operations of the 
company the letter said but thats double talk because at 
the same time they say they will immediately install a financial 
man from mary kay as avons chairman and chief executive officer 
the letter bearing the headline enough is enough urged 
avons sales representatives to write to the investment group on 
the companys behalf it said sales reps have told avon that they 
cant be sold and that they wont go to work for mary kay to our 
representatives mary kay is the enemy 
the board said the attention of the company and its salespeople 
is once again being diverted unproductively by unwanted suitors 
these distractions have already cut measurably into the 
productivity of avons salespeople the attacks on avon are 
undermining our business said the boards letter 
earlier this year avon rejected outright takeover proposals from 
the rival direct sales company amway corp of ada mich and from 
minneapolisbased investor irwin jacobs avon also fended off 
takeover feelers from mary kay amway offered 21 billion for avon 
and jacobs offer was worth 285 billion

cineplex odeon chairman garth drabinsky says he 
will continue to work on a proposed bid to buy the major theater 
chain which he founded after missing a deadline to obtain 
financing for the deal 
drabinsky and his partner cineplex vice chairman myron 
gottlieb were to have secured financing by wednesday for their 
proposed bid of 1640 canadian per share for cineplex valued at 
more than 700 million 
the pair said in a statement thursday that adverse market 
conditions and a difficult financial climate were partly 
responsible for their inability to find a backer 
but they also said they were still negotiating with a special 
committee of the cineplex board that was set up to examine offers 
for the company which operates one of the largest movie theater 
chains in the united states 
we are discussing possible extensions and revisions to the 
proposed bid committee spokesman sandra kolber confirmed 
possibilities under consideration include an offer at a lower 
share price and a restructuring under which certain company assets 
would be sold to chip away at 750 million in longterm debt 
kolber said from montreal 
cineplex stock which fell 50 cents to 1263 wednesday on the 
toronto stock exchange was off another dollar thursday closing at 
1163 
in their statement drabinsky and gottlieb said they remain 
highly confident that financing would be arranged for an 
alternate buyout proposal 
the success of such a deal could depend on whether mca inc of 
los angeles and claridge inc of montreal cineplexs two top 
shareholders are willing to accept less than 1640 per share for 
their stock said marianne godwin an analyst with merrill lynch 
canada 
drabinsky is likely having trouble financing a deal because of 
the companys poor financial record she said 
on tuesday cineplex reported a net loss of 84 million for the 
third quarter that ended sept30 compared with a profit of 172 
million for the same period a year earlier 
cineplex odeon corp is north americas secondlargest theatre 
chain with 500 locations and 1870 screens 
drabinsky a 41yearold lawyer founded the company in toronto 
a decade ago he proposed buying the business oct25 and got mca 
and claridge to agree to sell their stock if a nov15 financing 
deadline was met 
drabinsky and gottlieb were also to be reimbursed by cineplex 
for up to 10 million in expenses related to their bid if they met 
the deadline

the new york stock exchange said computerized 
program trading declined in october but analysts cuationed that 
the data should not be interpreted as a direct response to recent 
market gyrations 
program trading strategies accounted for 97 percent of an 
average total daily volume of 1824 million shares or 177 million 
shares a day in october on the nyse the nations largest stock 
exchange 
that marked a decline from 209 million shares or 138 percent 
of a total of 1518 million shares traded daily in september the 
nyse said thursday that was the largest percentage since the big 
board began tracking the numbers in july 1988 
the numbers are interesting as a statistic but they dont 
really provide any insight into what program trading does to the 
marketplace psychology said jack barbanel president of first 
global asset management inc 
this 9 percent may cause the market to generate another 5 
percent in volume he said 
the big board defines program trading as any order for the 
purchase or sale of 15 or more stocks a strategy known as index 
arbitrage which links stock and stockindex futures trading has 
been blamed widely for heightening market volatility 
barbanel also said the nyses calculations are not limited to 
index arbitrage and have come under criticism for possibly 
overstating the amount of actual program trading activity the nyse 
said index arbitrage accounted for 538 percent of its october 
program trades 
several wall street brokerages abandoned index arbitrage for 
their own and customer accounts in late october and the lower nyse 
figures may somewhat reflect the exodus analysts said 
debate over program trading intensified after a 190point drop 
by the dow jones industrial average on oct 13 and a rapid 80point 
rise during the oct 24 session 
investors and corporations complained that the strategy was 
scaring away individual investors and making it harder to raise 
capital in the stock market 
the nyse earlier this month instituted a series of measures 
limiting program trading during times of market volatility and 
encouraged member firms to avoid the strategy when the markets 
surge a bill that would limit some aspects of program trading is 
pending before congress 
the big board reported that program trading on all markets 
averaged 208 million shares a day in october down from 240 
million the previous month it said 849 percent of octobers 
trading took place on the nyse with 134 percent abroad and 17 
percent in other us markets 
among brokerages morgan stanley amp co was the largest program 
trader in october with 587 million shares traded during the month 
followed by salomon brothers inc with 572 million shares and 
kidder peabody amp co with 569 million shares a small philadelphia 
investment management firm susquehanna investment group was the 
fourthlargest program trader up from ninth in september 
morgan stanley and kidder peabody said they ceased index 
arbitrage trading for their own accounts late in october several 
other firms followed with similar steps

federal management hasnt seemed to affect the 
ambiance for guests of the phoenician a 270 million resort hotel 
owned by charles keatings failed lincoln savings and loan 
keating and 23 family members and associates were dismissed 
thursday from their managerial positions at the phoenician and 
lincolns other upscale property the cresent hotel in phoenix 
they were replaced by managers hired by federal regulators 
regulators accompanied by fbi agents phoenix police officers 
and private security guards seized the properties at 130 am 
according to alan j whitney a spokesman for the resolution trust 
corp the federal agency created this summer to handle failed sampls 
few of the guests staying at the 605room phoenician seemed 
particularly aware of the change in management life went on at the 
resorts sprawling golf tennis and golf complex carved from the 
base of a mountain overlooking phoenix and scottsdale 
aj stoll of oregon who was vacationing with his wife sally 
said he had noticed new faces and was aware of the rtcforced 
change in management 
we see them all over with their walkietalkies the feds the 
people who work here all smile at you the feds dont smile he 
said 
jayne glenn who lives in one of the phoenician cottages said 
the new management could only be an improvement 
its not run very good she said the food is bad and the 
service is bad they just cant get their act together 
weve not heard a thing and weve been here all day said 
paul hertz of miami as television news helicopters buzzed over the 
resort and camera crews roamed the marbled lobby 
room rates at the phoenician featured by robin leach on his 
television special the rich and famous 1989 worlds best 
range from 200 to 3750 a night 
travel agents were unsure what effect the action would have on 
reservations at the palatial phoenician which paid 25 million for 
original art to hang in its hallways and ordered more steinway 
pianos at one time eight for a total of over 350000 than any 
private company in history 
i think we would have to kind of study what the impact is 
going to be before we would advise our customers said rob 
wunsch a travel agent with the american express travel service in 
denver 
an agent for ask mr foster travel in denver who refused to 
give her name said her office had been told a week ago not to book 
customers at the 344room crescent which targets business 
clientele 
one person who will be discouraged from returning to the 
pheonician is keating himself who used to have an office there 
regulators said 
a spokesman for keating denounced the seizure as the most 
despicable outrageous blatant act of terror we have ever seen by 
our us government 
the gestapolike tactics used on employees and management of 
the resort are just unconscionable added bradley boland senior 
vice president of lincolns parent company american continental 
corp of phoenix and keatings soninlaw 
keatings continuation as manager of the phoenician had galled 
members of the house banking committee which is investigating the 
collapse of the irvine califbased thrift the debacle is 
expected to be the nations largest savings and loan failure 
costing taxpayers an estimated 2 billion 
although keating drew no salary as manager of the phoenician he 
continues to receive 400000 a year as chairman of american 
continental he is scheduled to testify before the house banking 
panel tuesday 
american continental filed for federal bankruptcy protection 
april 13 and federal regulators seized lincoln and its 
subsidiaries including the phoenician the next day 
they later filed a 11 billion lawsuit against keating and his 
associates alleging fraud and racketeering 
however they could not dismiss keating until they obtained the 
approval of the kuwaiti investment office which has a 45 percent 
interest in the resort and the right to block management changes 
whitney said the office based in london makes real estate 
investments on behalf of the kuwaiti government he said

south korea is manipulating its currency to 
gain advantages in foreign trade the us says and the bush 
administration will press for progress by april in negotiations 
aimed at stopping the practice a senior treasury official says 
informal talks since the summer of 1986 have had some result in 
persuading the south koreans to allow their currency the won to 
appreciate against the dollar david c mulford treasury 
undersecretary for international affairs said thursday 
but the korean system remains inherently manipulative and 
the united states hopes in january to begin a round of formal talks 
with seoul aimed at changing it mulford told the senate banking 
subcommittee on international finance and monetary policy 
sen paul s sarbanes dmd chairman of the panel warned that 
congress was growing impatient with south korea and would press to 
tie the currency question to other uskorean trade matters if 
progress wasnt evident soon 
the largest us trade deficits are with japan and west germany 
but in recent years the deficit has soared with newly 
industrialized countries in asia such as south korea and taiwan 
in october 1988 the united states charged both south korea and 
taiwan with manipulating their currencies to maintain their trade 
surpluses efforts by the two countries to keep their currencies 
weak make their goods cheaper on us markets and make american 
products more expensive for their consumers 
however mulford noted with approval that taiwan changed its 
system in april and said there is no evidence that its central bank 
continues to intervene in currency markets the new taiwan dollar 
has strengthened by 5 percent since april in contrast with the 
won which has weakened slightly he said 
meanwhile at a separate hearing a private economist told a 
house banking subcommittee that south koreas shrinking trade 
surplus indicates there is no basis for the currency manipulation 
charges the surplus has shrunk 28 percent in the first nine months 
of this year compared with the same period last year 
john williamson senior fellow at the institute for 
international economics said the administration was attempting to 
deflect attention from its own failure to live up to international 
monetary agreements by shrinking its budget deficit 
however sarbanes said i think the currency manipulation has 
to be straigtened out the fact that south koreas surpluses 
may have dwindled somewhat does not eliminate that problem 
in a related matter federal reserve board vice chairman manuel 
h johnson in response to a question from sarbanes acknowledged a 
rift between the central bank and the treasury department over 
exchange rate policy 
unlike treasury officials johnson said he and other fed members 
do not believe in massive currency sales to drive the dollar lower 
when market forces are driving the value higher fed members favor 
such sales only to stabilize a disorderly market he said 
sarbanes faulted the fed for allegedly undermining a sept 23 
agreement among the united states and its major economic allies 
that sought to drive the dollar lower 
however both johnson and mulford played down the significance 
of the dispute and said policy coordination was working smoothly

federal regulators handling the nations 
largest savings and loan failure have seized a luxury resort in the 
arizona desert from phoenix millionaire charles h keating jr the 
sampls owner 
the regulators accompanied by fbi agents local police and 
private security guards on the 130 am raid thursday took 
control of two keating properties the phoenician a 605room golf 
resort near scottsdale and the 344room crescent hotel in phoenix 
keating his wife mary elaine keating two daughters two 
sonsinlaw and 18 other associates were fired from management 
positions at the properties owned by a subsidiary of lincoln 
savings and loan association irvine calif 
later thursday a source said the senate ethics committee would 
hire an outside counsel to investigate five senators who received a 
total of 13 million in campaign contributions from keating and 
intervened with regulators on his behalf 
there was no indication from the source who spoke on condition 
of anonymity whether the committee had decided on an individual to 
investigate sens alan cranston dcalif dennis deconcini 
dariz john glenn dohio john mccain rariz and donald 
riegle dmich 
in related developments 
cranston became the third senator to formally respond to the 
senate ethics committee inquiry into the allegations that the five 
senators intervened with regulators on behalf of keating 
a top aide to sampl regulator m danny wall complained that 
securities and exchange commission chairman richard c breeden in 
criticizing the thrift agency gave sworn testimony to the house 
banking panel that was simply not true 
a keating representative called the seizure of the phoenician 
the most despicable outrageous blatant act of terror we have 
ever seen by our us government 
the gestapolike tactics used on employees and management of 
the resort are just unconscionable said bradley boland senior 
vice president of american continental corp lincolns parent 
company 
they walked in they locked offices they locked desks 
then they went out into the community to the homes of the core 
management group and posted severance notices on their front doors 
these guys are gutless ruthless faceless bureaucrats trying to 
carry out their ongoing vendetta against charlie keating boland 
said 
keatings continuation as manager of the phoenician had 
particularly irked members of the house banking committee which is 
investigating the thrifts collapse expected to cost taxpayers 2 
billion 
a recent newspaper advertisement for the resort said robin leach 
featured the phoenician on his television special the rich and 
famous 1989 worlds best room rates range from 200 a night to 
3750 for the most expensive suite according to the house panel 
alan j whitney a spokesman for the resolution trust corp 
created in august to handle failed sampls said regulators had been 
trying to take over the resort since april when they seized 
lincoln 
the government filed a 11 billion fraud and racketeering suit 
against keating and his associates but officials were delayed in 
taking over the resort because its minority owner the kuwaiti 
investment office had the authority to block changes in management 
obtaining approval from the londonbased kuwaiti office was 
awkward and cumbersome whitney said 
although keating was not paid as manager of the phoenician he 
continues to receive a 400000ayear salary as chairman of 
american continental which has filed for protection under 
bankruptcy laws 
keating is scheduled to testify before the house banking panel 
on tuesday 
meanwhile cranston said in his written response to the ethics 
committee that he violated no laws ethical standards or senate 
rules in two april 1987 meetings with regulators examining 
lincolns finances 
i never attempted to derail any investigation of wrongdoing at 
lincoln nor did i ever suggest that an investigation be 
delayed cranston wrote 
riegle and deconcini provided material to the committee earlier 
glenn and mccain have not filed formal responses but have denied 
wrongdoing 
the sec is investigating the accuracy of financial statements 
filed by american continental and breeden told the house banking 
committee earlier this week that walls agency undermined the probe 
in 1988 by accepting lincolns financial statements as accurate 
thrift office senior deputy karl t hoyle said in a letter to 
the banking panel that regulators ultimately rejected much of 
lincolns financial statements and in any event did nothing that 
would have prevented the sec from pursuing its investigation

martin marietta corp has been awarded a 1566 
million contract by nasa to launch the first us spacecraft to 
mars since 1976 
the contract awarded thursday to the companys denver 
astronautics group is seen as an important victory in the 
competitive commercial space market where martin marietta competes 
with mcdonnell douglas corp general dynamics corp and the french 
arianespace program to launch private communications satellites and 
military payloads 
the contract calls for martin to build a 155foot titan 3 launch 
vehicle and an upper stage booster to propel nasas mars observer 
out of earth orbit nasa is scheduled to launch the spacecraft in 
september 1992 
the spacecraft will orbit mars 13 times a day for two years 
studying the planets geology and climate 
martin officials said the contract could be the first of many in 
which nasa orders not just rockets but the manpower and expertise 
to launch them nasa is encouraging the commercial space industry 
by choosing to launch some government payloads through private 
carriers 
it may well be an example of future us government 
procurement approaches said edward browne president of martin 
marietta commercial titan inc 
until recently the commercial titan program was a problem area 
in martins otherwise profitable rocket business the company 
originally expected to reap up to 300 million annually launching 
private payloads but later scaled back expectations becasuse the 
demand for launch services was below the combined supply of rockets 
the 450 million mars observer mission was one of four high 
priority missions recommended by a nasa advisory board in 1983

resorts international inc bondholders have 
played a game of lets make a deal with owner merv griffin 
trading some of the money theyre owed for resorts stock while 
betting he can revive the sickly casino company 
one of the advisers to the bondholders calls the agreement 
announced last week a model for how the parties to a nearbankrupt 
company can work together 
this had the potential for five years of litigation said 
arthur b newman a chemical bank investment banker and bondholder 
adviser and no one wins in five years of litigation except 
of course the lawyers 
newman represents investors who own the 600 million in resorts 
bonds issued before griffin bought the company from developer 
donald j trump last year the second group of bondholders are 
those who bought the 325 million worth of junk bonds that gave 
griffin the money for the takeover 
under the agreement griffin will give bondholders 78 percent of 
the stock in the company which he owns outright in exchange for 
their going along with a resorts bankruptcy filing on friendly 
terms 
griffin the entertainment magnate and former talk show host 
also agreed to inject 30 million in fresh cash to rehabilitate the 
companys aging atlantic city casino and other properties 
resorts which stopped paying interest on its bonds in august 
will operate under protection of a bankruptcy court for a brief 
period according to the plan before emerging as a presumably 
healthier company early next year with much lower debt 
the plan will also provide bondholders with new bonds or notes 
in the company it must be approved by owners of twothirds of the 
bonds 
newman said the two bondholder groups along with griffins 
people hammered out the agreement in just one week 
everybody worked very very hard he said last week 
everybody hurts a little he said referring to compromises 
that were made 
newman said the resorts case is the first to his knowledge in 
which a major nearbankrupt company and its creditors agreed to a 
reorganization plan before the actual bankruptcy filing it is 
called a prepackaged bankruptcy 
newman advised the main creditors group in the texaco inc 
bankruptcy case which was bitterly fought and expensive citing 
the smooth resorts deal he said i think people are just getting 
smarter 
some analysts said the resorts deal it appears to be a fair 
compromise said steven eisenberg an industry analyst for bear 
stearns amp co inc 
but others said the bondholders may see little of the money they 
invested unless the company stages a dramatic turnaround 
gamblers at merv griffins resorts have more odds of seeing 
their money repaid than the junkbond holders said paul getman 
an economist for wefa group an economic consulting firm in bala 
cynwyd pa 
getman had little sympathy for either griffin or the 
bondholders he characterized resorts as another overleveraged 
takeover that was based on unrealistic projections of a companys 
ability to sell assets and pull in money 
these bonds are what a year old is this what were coming 
to that you cant trust a promise to repay principle and interest 
that is a year old he said of the resorts highyield bonds it 
is just another chapter in what i think is going to be a long sad 
spectacle in junkbond ownership 
however the bond market cheered the deal prices of resorts 
bonds surged the day the agreement was confirmed 
griffin bought resorts a year ago after a heated takeover battle 
with trump who owns several other atlantic city casinos another 
aspect of the reorganization plan is that bondholders expect to 
file a fraudulent conveyance lawsuit against trump 
such a suit would claim that something of value was transferred 
to trump in the buyout without him giving a fair return to the 
company one such asset is the huge incomplete taj mahal casino in 
atlantic city which trump bought for 273 million as part of his 
deal with griffin after resorts spent about 500 million on it 
griffin avoided becoming a target of such a suit by agreeing to 
the reorganization plan according to those involved in the deal 
in a statement trump said griffin should accept full 
responsibility for resorts problems instead of pursuing wholly 
baseless and ultimately wasteful claims against me

a market reform bill allowing the securities 
and exchange commission to halt trading during stock market 
emergencies with the presidents consent has cleared the senate 
banking committee 
the proposed market reform act of 1989 passed by the panel on 
thursday would give the sec authority to take temporary emergency 
action in response to a major market disturbance 
but the president would be required to state that he does not 
disapprove of any action before it could take effect 
meanwhile a similar bill is stuck in committee on the house 
side and appears unlikely to make it to the floor before congress 
adjourns for the holidays 
house staffers said the bill stalled after rep norman lent 
rny the ranking republican on the energy and commerce committee 
proposed adding amendements that would limit provisions requiring 
brokerdealers to report large trades and the financial status of 
their parent companies 
on the the senate side however the banking housing and urban 
affairs committee also approved an amendment proposed by sen 
alfonse damato rny that would require the sec to report back 
three months after enactment on whether it has enough authority to 
address the potential for manipulation and fraud involving 
computerized program trading 
this legislation contains important reforms dealing with sec 
emergency powers said sen john heinz rpa one of the bills 
sponsors these reforms are not going to change the way the 
markets operate but they will help the sec better understand and 
cope with them 
the house bill also would give the sec the power to curtail 
practices deemed manipulative or abusive including program 
trading during periods of high volatility 
that measure pending before the house energy and commerce 
committee went farther than the pending senate bill 
the senate bill which now goes to the full senate would give 
the sec authority to 
halt trading during stock market emergencies like the crash of 
1987 or the 190point drop last month 
require large securities transactions to be reported 
require the parent and affiliated companies of securities and 
investment firms to verify their financial stability 
coordinate the clearance and settlement of stock option and 
future trades with the commodity futures trading commission the 
federal agency that oversees the futures markets 
the senate bill was introduced in march by sen christopher 
dodd dconn and heinz at the request of the sec 
the bill seeks to prevent some of the problems that contributed 
to the stock market plunge in october 1987 
its absolutely critical that we pass this before we go 
dodd told the panel which approved the bill by a voice vote after 
leaders said they would oppose attempts to include amendements that 
would limit takeovers or leveraged buyouts

boyd l jefferies the governments star witness 
in the gaf corp stock manipulation trial has testified for the 
first time that he assumed the companys chairman knew about the 
alleged crimes 
jefferies under crossexamination said thursday that gaf 
chairman samuel j heymanplayed a role in the 1986 transactions 
that form the basis of the governments case against gaf two 
subsidiaries and vice chairman james t sherwin 
heyman has not been charged in the case which is in its third 
trial in us district court in manhattan following two mistrials 
i felt that mr sherwin and i had been set up by mr heyman 
jefferies said on his fourth day on the stand i assumed that mr 
heyman had instructed mr sherwin what to do 
it was the first time in the three trials that jefferies 
indicated he was acting under instructions believed to come from 
heyman under questioning from sherwins attorney stephen kaufman 
jefferies said he wasnt changing his testimony but only making 
an assumption 
defense lawyers this week have sought to attack jefferies 
credibility pointing out several times that he had altered his 
testimony from the first two trials 
the government has charged that sherwin asked jefferies to buy 
shares of union carbide corp in october 1986 in an attempt to 
raise the companys stock price at a time when gaf wanted to sell 
millions of carbide shares 
in a deal with the government jefferies agreed to testify in 
several cases and plead guilty to two felonies jefferies who was 
implicated in securities crimes by nowjailed speculator ivan f 
boesky was sentenced last summer to probation and a 250000 fine 
the subject of heyman arose wednesday when jefferies was asked 
why he didnt discuss with heyman his purchase of 190000 carbide 
shares on oct 29 and oct 30 1986 when the two were together in 
tucson ariz 
i knew that mr heyman did not want to be associated with 
it he said

a stock manipulation trial involving gaf corp 
has resumed but without the packed courtroom and media attention it 
drew the first time around before two mistrials took the steam out 
of the case 
i think theres just a boredom factor said alan bromberg a 
securities law professor at southern methodist university how 
many times do we want to see this movie 
when the trial opened almost a year ago the judge had to move 
the proceedings to a larger courtroom at us district court to 
accommodate a crush of reporters lawyers and other spectators 
now theres plenty of room available at the lower manhattan 
courthouse reporters drop by occasionally but few stories are 
filed 
the testimony earlier this week of boyd jefferies who once 
packed the house as governments star securities fraud witness 
drew scant attention even when he testified for the first time 
that he assumed gaf chairman samuel j heyman directed the alleged 
scheme it was the trials first nugget of news 
much of the third trial of the wayne njbased chemicals maker 
and a top executive which started nov 1 has been rehash despite 
the mistrials one due to a procedural error one to a hung jury 
the substance hasnt changed 
the proceedings began last december as the first criminal trial 
stemming from the insider trading scandals of the mid1980s on 
wall street it was seen as a test of whether the government could 
win securities convictions before a jury 
the case also marked the first courtroom appearance of 
jefferies a los angeles stockbroker linked to jailed speculator 
ivan boesky who agreed to testify in several cases as part of a 
plea deal with federal prosecutors 
gaf two subsidiaries and vice chairman james t sherwin were 
charged with stock manipulation for allegedly trying to boost union 
carbide corps share price in 1986 shortly before selling a large 
block of its stock 
they also were charged with securities fraud wire fraud and 
conspiracy and the government made the case the opening act of a 
half dozen planned whitecollar fraud trials 
but gaf i ended in a january mistrial after he government 
unintentionally withheld a key piece of evidence in march the 
jury in the second trial deadlocked after 12 days of deliberations 
since then gaf has lost its luster amid a series of flashier 
cases the government has won jury convictions of florida investor 
paul bilzerian and six executives in the princetonnewport partners 
trial plus several guilty pleas and the racketeering indictment of 
former junk bond financier michael milken 
speculation over whether jefferies testimony would earn him a 
lenient sentence also ended jefferies who testified against 
bilzerian was sentenced in july to probation for his guilty plea 
to two felonies 
its no longer the first said john j coffee jr a 
columbia university securities law professor most of the other 
cases have been resolved i think the world will focus on milken 
and will not remember gaf 
on wednesday for instance three reporters attended part of the 
proceedings in courtroom 705 smaller than the site of the first 
two trials where gaf attorney arthur liman crossexamined 
jefferies a second day one reporter filed a story 
liman attacked jefferies credibility by raising contradictions 
in earlier trial testimony about when he talked to sherwin when he 
made union carbide stock sales and where he kept yellow note pads 
in his office 
jefferies appeared flustered this time around when he told 
liman to be honest with you this thing happened a long time ago 
and i put it out of my mind 
but after a break he turned assertive saying i had a 
contract with mr sherwin to perform a certain duty at the request 
of the customer i think he was very very pleased 
jefferies said sherwin asked him in october 1986 to inflate the 
stock price of union carbide and agreed to cover any losses the 
purpose of the alleged deal was to maximize gafs gain from the 
sale of union carbide stock after a failed takeover of the larger 
chemical company 
sherwin of princeton nj said in a courthouse interview this 
week that he has been working normally at gaf which he joined in 
1960 while the media and lawyers may be uninterested associates 
say the lengthy case remains an ordeal for him 
once a top us chess player sherwin talked eagerly about a 
15yearold soviet boy gata kamsky who lived with sherwins 
family briefly after a highly publicized defection in april 
we played ping pong and chess said sherwin who is 
president of the american chess foundation i could beat him in 
ping pong

the edsel the car that has come to symbolize 
failure in modern automaking may be gone but its not forgotten 
there was a time when owners of edsels named after henry fords 
son were laughed at and questioned about their mental condition 
when they drove the car 
but three decades after ford motor co stopped making the car on 
nov 19 1959 folks still get together and talk about those 
funnylooking cars with the horse collar in the grille 
according to the old cars price guide a 1958 twodoor edsel 
citation hardtop in mint condition could fetch up to 13000 or 
almost four times the original price of 3500 
thats not keeping up with the rate of inflation but its not 
bad for a car that has a reputation as a marketing disaster 
paul yount said he and his wife ethel buy edsels out of 
affection they have owned 53 of them at their farm in polo ill 
when you go crazy you go crazy he said 
yount said it was the edsels high price not its puckerfaced 
appearance that led to its demise a recession struck in 1957 and 
dealers didnt lower their sticker price while they lowered the 
other sticker prices he said 
the name didnt help either historians have written that the 
name taken from the original henry fords son edsel bryant ford 
initially was thrown out it was adopted later after thousands of 
other names were rejected 
edsel buffs even blame the cold war for hurting the edsels 
changes 
the public was in a blue funk because at the very time we 
introduced the car the russians were successful in launching an 
intercontinental missile said gale warnock who handled public 
relations during the edsels 1957 launch 
he recalled an early edsel joke that appeared in the new yorker 
magazine showing one person talking to another saying something 
like great the russians have an intercontinental missile and we 
have an edsel 
that really fries me warnock said of edsel jokes 
however he acknowledged the word edsel has become a synonym 
for loser every comedian uses it when they want to describe 
something horrible 
the only edsel at ford these days is edsel b ford ii 40 head 
of the companys marketing staffs he has been on the ford board of 
directors since last year 
the sept 4 1957 public introduction of the edsel capped a 
launch program that began in march 1956 during those 18 months 
ford teased the public with magazine advertisements that showed a 
blur of an edsel roaring down a rural highway 
lately some mysterious automobiles have been seen on the 
roads read an advertisement in the july 22 1957 issue of life 
the edsel is on its way 
when showrooms opened up crowds were big a telegram to edsel 
executives from a c pickrell of beacon edsel in inglewood calif 
described showroom traffic 
reception to car fantastic have written seven orders 
delivered five cars had approximately 2000 people through our 
showroom went through 45 gallons of coffee 26 dozen doughnuts 
darndest coffee and doughnut town ive ever been in 
from there things quickly went downhill 
ford projected sales of 290000 by 1960 but production which 
is based on sales fell far short of that the company made 63100 
edsels for the 1958 model year 44891 for 1959 and just 2846 for 
the 1960 model year before stopping the edsel assembly line 
the edsel had a number of unique features some of which died 
with the car and some that live on only in expensive models today 
edsel featured a teletouch transmission which had 
pushbutton shifting on the steering wheel hub thats no more 
anywhere 
but it also offered as accessories a compass a stationseeking 
radio and thermometers to show inside and outside temperatures 
sophisticated versions of which are on todays cars 
those kinds of features helped the car get some rave reviews 
from auto journals of the day 
the edsel could very well be an indication of things to 
come read a review in motor life a magazine that ceased to 
exist on its own in december 1961 when it was absorbed by sports

there is one thing above all others that 
insurance buyers must do says joe mintz and that is compare the 
offerings of various companies before paying a nickel 
the reason incredible price differences for the same coverage 
mintz a former insurance broker has only one goal these days 
that is to educate the public and accountants financial planners 
insurance agents elected officials and others who have 
responsibilities to the public 
an example a 54yearold nonsmoking male friend of mintz 
sought a 325000 term life insurance policy recently he checked 
with three of the biggest companies in america about annual costs 
over a 10year period 
the results one company quoted 30539 another 22882 and the 
third 21010 
the lowestpriced company guaranteed the price the 
secondlowest said it might raise annual premiums after three 
years the highest said annual premiums might rise after just one 
year it didnt guarantee anything after that time 
joe a mintz 71 is a legend in insurance circles a hero by 
some accounts a notorious pest by others working from a dallas 
apartment he and his computer delve deep into the the mysterious 
workings of the industry 
from it comes material for seminars testimony before congress 
and state boards of insurance educational speeches before 
accounting and financial planning groups assistance to friends 
and material for a monthly newsletter 
the nroca news letter 72 a year 45 for six months 27 
for a fourmonth trial dept r box 12066 dallas texas 75225 
is jammed with personal finance items some startling and all aimed 
at getting the most for a dollar 
if joe is sometimes contentious it is in an affable way because 
he prefers evidence to conflict what he says therefore usually 
is revealing and convincing and often deeply irritating even to 
professional practioners 
here is another example a real one as of a month or so ago 
that shows not just the variety of options and products but the 
necessity for shopping before buying 
you are 65 in a 28 percent tax bracket and concerned about the 
future your 100000 nest egg must go a long way so you consider 
some of the options a certificate of deposit a life annuity and a 
refund annuity 
at age 65 that 100000 in a cd would earn you 6480 a year 
after taxes the life annuity would pay 8847 a year for nine 
years then 7500 for life the refund annuity would pay 8325 a 
year for l0 years then 7025 for life 
the certificate of deposit would be fully taxable 
the life annuity would be partially taxable until you had been 
repaid the 100000 then it would be fully taxable it would pay 
you as long as you lived but if you died tomorrow your investment 
would be gone 
the refund annuity would pay you for life but if you died 
before recovering your investment your heir would receive the 
remainder of the 100000 
mintz point is this you cannot just accept what is available 
you must shop around until you find the product designed for you 
and then seek comparisons doing so could mean thousands of 
dollars difference a year 
like all insurance products payments vary all over the lot 
he says making it necessary for the buyer o insist that the agent 
shop or better still ask more than one agent to quote bids 
among questions to ask your agent how many companies do you 
represent can you go into the open market do you give all your 
business to a single company 
a company that is competitive one week will not be so the next 
says mintz and he says it isnt much different with savings 
acocunts and certificates of deposits at banks savings and loan 
and credit unions 
watch your pennies says joe small amounts saved are the same 
as money earned invested wisely that money can grow and make your 
working years and retirement better thats what nroca acorn

rochester telephone corp is finding 
itself a long way from home these days 
the name may not ring bells in most parts of the country but 
rochester telephone has become one of the countrys fastestgrowing 
and most aggressive telephone companies this year alone rochester 
telephone has scooped up 11 midwestern companies in places like 
mondovi wis mt pulaski ill and fairmount ind capitalizing 
on moves toward deregulation that have turned small phone companies 
into big moneymakers 
in the last five years rochester telephone has grown from a 
onestate operation with a few scattered subsidiaries to the parent 
company of 23 telephone companies in six states it is the 16th 
largest telephonecompany in the country including the seven former 
baby bells 
when all pending acquisitions are completed the company will 
have 620000 phone lines with nearly 30 percent of them outside 
its base in the rochester area in the glassandmarble lobby of 
the companys downtown headquarters a colored map showing 
rochester telephones subsidiaries is perpetually out of date 
stock analysts have been touting the value of the nonbell phone 
companies for years that enthusiasm has grown as deregulation 
appears to be spreading in the industry 
the 1990s will be to the independent telephone companies what 
the 1980s were for cable said kenneth berents of butcher amp 
singer in philadelphia 
rochester telephone has its own vice president for acquisitions 
john purcell he said prices of small companies have risen 30 
percent in the past 18 months pushed up competition by from other 
expansionminded companies 
nobodys stealing telephone companies today he said the 
competition wont allow it 
the phone business is a very healthy business said joel d 
gross of donaldson lufkin amp jenrette securities corp in new york 
the price is obviously going to go up because the value has gone 
up 
small companies many of them serving only a few thousand 
customers have an excellent track record of providing 
highquality service and keeping customers satisfied many of them 
have been owned by the same family for generations without the 
bureaucracy of a larger operation to slow them down they have been 
able to install the latest digital technology often before even 
the bell companies have made the switch purcell said 
the small companies are becoming increasingly profitable as many 
states relax regulation and experiment with setting price caps 
instead of controlling the profit margin gross said 
wisconsin where rochester telephone acquired five companies 
this year has been one of the most aggressive experimenters 
small companies are adding customers as suburbanites spill out 
into rural areas making them very attractive to companies such as 
rochester telephone with bases in mature markets 
despite the success of the small phone companies rapid advances 
in technology and changes in the telephone business are making it 
harder for them to stay independent among other things they are 
are vulnerable to being bypassed by tie lines that allow 
companies to connect farflung operations without going through the 
local phoe company 
rochester telephone persuades small companies to sell out by 
allowing its subsidiaries to remain essentially autonomous purcell 
said in many cases the owners stay on and run the operation 
rochester telephone prides itself on never making hostile 
takeovers he said 
were not a bank were not a holding company were a 
telephone company purcell said our people are very 
experienced telephone people 
rochester telephone once said it would not expand west of the 
mississippi but today there are no limits purcell said company 
officials have paid calls on 95 potential acquisitions in 18 states 
in the last year he said 
but despite the ravenous appetites of companies like rochester 
telephone small phone companies are not yet a disappearing breed 
analysts said the number of small phone companies has shrunk by 
nearly 10 percent since 1980 and will continue shrinking but 
there are still about 1200 left 
for one thing the pool of potential buyers of telephone 
companies is limited said james j stork vice president of duff amp 
phelps inc in chicago 
the former bell companies have not shown much interest in 
takeovers and most nontelephone companies probably dont want to 
get involved in a regulated business stork said corporate raiders 
would be unlikely to find much favor with industry regulators he 
said 
acquisitions by rochester telephone and other large independents 
such as contel corp and century telephone enterprises inc are 
just part of the way phone companies have always operated gross 
said 
if you go back to the 60s and 70s thats the way a lot of 
the companies were built in the first place he said thats 
the way the bell companies were built at the turn of the century

when the mud dauber wasps at the 
wooster ranch build nests on the telephone lines cutting off 
service all patty wooster does is contact her friend cheryl at the 
phone company 
like ms wooster many of the 1800 customers of the calaveras 
telephone co ask for service representatives by name a repairman 
is quickly dispatched to knock down wasp nests repair cut cables 
or install new lines 
in an era of communication conglomerates and impersonal service 
the familyrun calaveras telephone co gives residents of this 
remote cattleranching community in the sierra foothills a personal 
touch 
where other employers give their staff cash bonuses company 
president howard tower 66 goes to the calaveras county fair and 
buys 4h cattle and pigs then has them butchered packaged and 
divided between the 21 employees 
yet the rural charm and small size of the calaveras telephone 
co mask a modern hightech enterprise 
tower an unassuming man with a full head of brown hair keeps 
telephone memorabilia in a hutch in his office but he proudly 
shows off his ibm computer system and would rather talk about the 
companys future than its colorful past 
located in a part of the gold country immortalized by mark twain 
in his 1865 story the celebrated jumping frogs of calaveras 
county the calaveras telephone co is a typical example of the 
independent phone industry 
these small independents were never a part of the atampt bell 
system which was forced to divest itself of regional subsidiaries 
in 1984 
familyowned rural and normally serving less than 3000 
customers calaveras and the 1200 or so companies like it in the 
united states have survived both the building up and breaking up of 
the bell system 
gone are the days of local switchboard operators and even 
mechanical switching centers they have stateoftheart digital 
equipment offering such sophisticated services as call waiting and 
voice mail 
state regulators require telephone companies to give rebates to 
customers if profits go above a certain level calaveras has been 
refunding money to customers even though it has what tower claims 
are the lowest rates in california 
operating revenue last year was just over 2 million 
despite their success independent phone companies are declining 
in number around the country according to dolores donnelly 
executive vice president of the western rural telephone 
association the organization oversees financing for phone 
companies in 22 states 
in some cases the companies are bought out by bigger 
acquisitionminded independents like rochester telephone corp in 
other cases small neighbors merge for greater efficiency she said 
with a lot of familyowned companies the kids just dont want 
to take over the company the owners want to retire so they sell 
the next generation of the howard tower family in the telephone 
business is assured however all three of the tower children will 
help run the company when howard passes the handset 
sons james 28 and john 26 work the companys field 
facilities maintaining the cable and switching centers daughter 
mary 29 is the secretarytreasurer and their mother ellen 
tower is vice president 
calaveras telephone began in 1896 just a few years after 
alexander graham bells patents expired towers father james then 
16 hooked up some mouthpieces to the barbedwire fence that ran 
between his and his uncles house a mile down the road 
within weeks the local copper mines and neighboring ranchers 
were clamoring for service the young entrepreneur nicknamed 
barbed wire jim recruited windmills barns and trees as early 
telephone poles to connect the 200squaremile area 
the tower family is active in preserving the countys gold 
rushera buildings recently family members purchased the old 
copperopolis general store and mining claims office and plan to 
restore them 
although the boom years of copper and gold mining in 
copperopolis are over the future of calaveras telephone is bright 
the cheap housing and rustic setting are attracting commuters who 
work in stockton 35 miles to the west or even the san francisco 
bay area more than 80 miles west 
the company has grown steadily throughout the 80s and tower 
sees no end in sight were laying cable as fast as we can he 
said we are bound to serve people as best we can

will the next generation of asians shun 
curbside noodles curries and other indiginous food in favor of 
american burgers and fried chicken 
although the answer is still inconclusive a recent united 
nations report says american fast food has made major inroads 
across asia 
fast food is the latest megatrend in asia where it is 
definitely making an impact on the culture and lifestyles of the 
people as the people begin to have less and less time for a formal 
meal says the report the socioeconomic impact of 
transnational corporations in the fast food industry 
the report quoted one australianbased executive as saying 
asians are vulnerable towards fads from the west and some 
franchisers regard asia and other unexplored markets as potential 
dumping grounds for franchises 
according to the study us fastfood chains are most prevalent 
in japan where there are 350 mcdonalds franchises and 649 
kentucky fried chickens outlets among others 
hong kong follows close behind while popularity is growing in 
the philippines singapore malaysia and taiwan thailand is a 
relative latecomer but business is booming 
overall kentucky fried chicken does best in asia with 
mcdonalds second 
the first two attempts in thailand to introduce fast food were 
unsuccessful the british chain wimpys arrived in 1964 followed 
by kentucky fried chicken in 1970 both closed soon after us 
soldiers returned home from the vietnam war 
however mister donut broke into the market in 1978 and paved 
the way for six other usbased franchises 
at the time of the report bangkok had 60 fastfood outlets 
including 25 dunkin donuts 14 mister donuts seven pizza huts 
four kentucky fried chickens two mcdonalds and one dairy queen 
more are planned 
polls of customers at mcdonalds in bangkok showed they chose to 
eat there because of brand loyalty persuasion by their children 
convenience and atmosphere 
the study notes that world war ii played a major role in 
introducing american fast food to asia 
den fujita a mcdonalds franchise operator in japan is quoted 
as saying postwar changes in japan such as the introduction of 
bread and milk into the schools by americans enabled the japanese 
to adapt more easily to hamburgers and milkshakes 
in the philippines the american gi diet became a new status 
symbol after world war ii a whole generations of middleclass 
filipinos in the postwar years were raised on hot dogs pork and 
beans corned beef and vienna sausages 
china is one of the few major countries in asia that has not 
readily taken to the fastfood industry an exception is the 
successful twostory kentucky fried chicken restaurant on beijings 
tiananmen square 
as for the future of american fast food the report provided one 
clue having experienced the clean and cool atmosphere of 
fastfood restaurants children refuse outright to eat at hawkers 
stalls though the food there is much more delicious and priced 
more cheaply

dunkin donuts inc which fought off a hostile 
takeover attempt earlier this year said friday it has agreed to be 
acquired by the british food and beverage group alliedlyons plc 
for 325 million in cash 
we think this is the best possible deal said robert 
rosenberg dunkin donuts chairman we fit right in 
dunkin donuts had decided in september to accept friendly bids 
after dd acquisition corp a canadian partnership mounted a 
hostile 43ashare bid which later was raised to 45 a share 
under terms of the deal with alliedlyons the londonbased 
concern will pay 4725 a share for all outstanding common dunkin 
donuts shares 
they were the highest bidder rosenberg said it worked 
out well for our stockholders for our management for our 
franchises 
rosenberg declined to comment on the number of offers his 
company received 
dunkin donuts based in randolph has 1600 us outlets and 
250 abroad 
rosenberg said joining alliedlyons would strengthen his 
companys position as the worlds largest coffee and doughnut 
chain and he said the british company supports the goals of 
dunkin donuts to expand 
alliedlyons which already owns a number of north american food 
companies including the baskinrobbins ice cream franchise and the 
tea and coffee group tetley inc said dunkin donuts is a 
natural strategic fit with our existing strengths 
richard martin alliedlyons chief executive said the 
acquisition shows the companys determination to expand its food 
division and develop the successful dunkin donuts core franchise 
business with its strong cash flow 
roger lipton an analyst with ladenburg thalmann amp co inc in 
new york described alliedlyons as the right kind of buyer 
this is strategic rather than financial he said 
but he also said dd acquisition still would be a good buyer for 
dunkin donuts 
the canadian partnership was comprised of cara operations ltd 
a restaurant franchise company and kingsbridge capital group the 
merchant banking arm of toronto investor george manns unicorp 
canada corp 
lipton said despite the buyout agreement the canadian group 
could raise its offer and force the dunkin donuts board to 
consider a higher price 
eric evans a spokesman for dd acquisition said his group had 
no comment on fridays announcement and he would not say if the 
partnership might raise its bid 
rosenberg said he could not speculate on the possibility of a 
higher offer 
dunkin donuts in august reported a 34 percent drop in 
thirdquarter earnings much of it attributed to the battle against 
the hostile takeover

housing starts bounced back 12 percent in 
october from septembers sevenyear low the government reported 
friday and analsyts said they expect the construction rate to 
remain stable through the first quarter of 1990 
the housing market seems to have bottomed out said david 
seiders chief economist for the national association of home 
builders but he and other analysts said they do not foresee any 
surge in building just hanging in there 
the commerce department reported that new homes and apartments 
were built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 142 million 
units last month 
the 12 percent rebound from september was the sharpest gain 
since a 13 percent advance in december 1986 starts had fallen 46 
percent in september and 64 percent in august 
although septembers pace was revised up from the 126 million 
reported earlier it still was the most sluggish since new homes 
and apartments were built at an annual rate of 117 million units 
in october 1982 during the depths of the 198182 recession 
many analysts attributed the september construction drop to a 
spike in mortgage rates and said the october advance followed a 
subsequent decline 
the housing industry has been among the hardest hit as the 
federal reserve drove up interest rates to slow economic growth and 
lower inflation 
but the fed has slowly eased rates over the summer and except 
for the blip in september mortgage rates have fallen from marchs 
1122 percent peak to 982 percent by the end of october according 
to surveys by the federal home loan mortgage corp 
the higher rates stifled sales and boosted inventories of 
singlefamily homes to an 81month supply by last march said 
richard peach an economist for the mortgage bankers association 
as rates have fallen he said inventories have dropped to a 
6month supply which by historical standards are in good 
shape 
but even though many analysts expect mortgage rates to drop 
another half of a percentage point in coming months peach said he 
does not expect a major surge in building 
construction of singlefamily homes in october rose 69 percent 
to an annual rate of 103 million units singlefamily starts had 
fallen 3 percent in september and 35 percent in august 
apartment construction rose 28 percent in october to an annual 
rate of 393000 units it had fallen 94 percent in september after 
dropping 14 percent in august 
total housing starts during the first 10 months of the year were 
down 6 percent from the same period of 1988 
the south which posted a 147 drop for the steepest regional 
decline in september turned in the sharpest increase in october 
up 171 percent to 562000 units it was followed by the midwest 
with a 165 percent gain to 289000 units 
construction rose 6 percent in the northeast to 176000 units 
and 51 percent in the west to 393000 units

east germany on friday established a minister 
of tourism apparently to draw more visitors 
premier hans modrow in presenting his new 28member cabinet 
selected liberal democrat bruno benthien to head the ministry for 
tourism a post that didnt exist previously 
the move is seen as a strong indication east germany plans to 
expand tourism to earn sorely needed hard currency now that its 
borders have been thrown open for its own citizens to travel west 
freely 
while east germany always has permitted visitors to travel and 
drive through its territory it has also imposed strong 
restrictions that discouraged many tourists 
included in the restrictions is the mandatory exchange of the 
equivalent of 25 west german marks 14 per day per person while 
staying in the country 
officially east germany has insisted in the past of exchanging 
on a onetoone basis its marks for west german marks western 
prices for the east german marks fluctuates but in west germany is 
normally about one west german mark to 10 east german marks 
the mandatory exchange rate has long been a sore point with west 
germans traveling to visit relatives in east germany 
cornelia schmalzjacobsen secretarygeneral of west germanys 
businessoriented free democratic party said east germanys 
requirements for visitors were absurd 
through increased tourism the german democratic republic could 
earn much more than through the current mandatory exchange mrs 
schmalzjacobsen said 
another factor affecting tourism is east germanys strictly 
enforced 62 mph speed limits and the police practice of imposing 
onthespot fines if it is exceeded even slightly the fines for 
western visitors must be paid in dollars or west german marks and 
range from 11 up depending on the seriousness of the infraction 
in addition hotels are few in large cities and practically 
nonexistent in the rest of the country

a group of three sci television inc bondholders 
has filed a court petition to force the company into involuntary 
bankruptcy in move that could result in the sale of its six 
television stations 
the chapter 7 petition filed thursday in us bankruptcy court 
in delaware also asks that a trustee be appointed to oversee the 
company and bring any appropriate suit against any third parties 
responsible for scis condition 
sci television controlled by businessman george gillett and the 
buyout specialist kohlberg kravis roberts amp co has been 
struggling under the weight of heavy junk bond borrowing incurred 
in its 13 billion buyout in 1987 
it missed payments of principal and interest last month and 
proposed a restructuring under which bondholders would be given a 
39 percent equity stake in the company in exchange for some debt 
forgiveness 
in a statement the denverbased sci called the filing an 
unfortunate diversion from its talks with other bondholders about 
the restructuring 
it said the filing will not in any way impair or affect the 
operations of its tv subsidiaries nor does it affect gilletts 
interest under a separate company of the vail and beaver creek ski 
areas 
a chapter 7 bankruptcy petition would require sci television to 
sell off its assets to satisfy creditors sci has 20 days to 
respond to the petition 
sci television owns wsbktv in boston wjbktv in detroit 
wjwtv in cleveland wagatv in atlanta knsdtv in san diego and 
wititv in milwaukee 
the petition was filed on behalf of the investment firm sn 
phelps amp co based in greenwich conn and two individuals who 
said sci television failed to pay scheduled interest last month on 
about 180000 in bonds that they hold 
sci said in its statement that the missed interest payments to 
the three creditors amounted to less than 15000 
the filing came hours after the end of a 30day grace period for 
sci to find a way to pay an oct 15 interest payment or restructure 
its debt 
the company said it has had constructive discussions about 
its proposed restructuring with a bondholders steering committee 
and other bondholders who represent 95 percent of the companys 
public debt the three creditors filing the petition were not among 
those involved in the talks it said 
a lawyer for the petitioners i walton bader said his clients 
feel the tv stations should be sold because a liquidation could 
generate more value than a reorganization of the company or a 
restructuring of its debt 
sci television was once part of storer communications a company 
acquired in a leveraged buyout by kohlberg kravis in 1985 the 
storer tv stations were sold in a second deal for 13 billion in 
1987 
gillett owns about 55 percent of sci television and kohlberg 
owns the rest

british defense manufacturer ferranti on friday 
said it lost more than 157 million in cash because of fraud in its 
acquisition of the us company international signal amp control 
in total ferranti said its loss was the equivalent of 338 
million as a result of what it called a serious fraud involving 
bogus contracts which it unwittingly inherited when it bought the 
american company in november 1987 
ferrantis deputy managing director charles scott told a news 
conference about half the loss represented cash spirited out of the 
american firm the vast majority before the ferranti takeover 
in a rewritten version of its annual report ferranti 
international signal plc said iscs assets and profits were 
substantially inflated by a serious fraud which had been running 
for some years prior to the merger 
ferranti chairman sir derek alunjones said at the news 
conference that the fraud involved the creation of false contracts 
and the circulation of money to and from nonexistent customers 
through various vehicles including some panamanian and 
swissregistered companies i think most of the companies have 
been liquidated he said 
ferranti paid 660 million for the lancaster pabased defense 
contractor but it said it now believes the american company had no 
net worth at the time of the merger even though iscs audited 
balance purported to show a net worth of 320 million 
alunjones said the company expects to initiate legal 
proceedings soon to try to recover some of the money but he said 
there was a chance it would never recover anything 
scotland yards serious fraud office and the us federal bureau 
of investigation have said they are investigating alunjones 
refused to say who the company believed was responsible or where 
the money had gone 
ferranti has renegotiated a 471 million loan package with its 
bankers to keep afloat and has been looking for either a rescue 
merger or a substantial injection of capital from a new partner 
alunjones said he was holding talks with between 10 and 15 
people about a possible merger or takeover of the company he 
refused to identify them citing confidentiality agreements 
in the meantime he said the company will continue to dispose 
of businesses which arent central to its strategy 
he said the company was nearing completion of the sale of the 
maintenance and service division of ferranti computer systems ltd 
and the disposal of marquardt co in the united states a maker of 
propulsion technology and ordnance products the combined asset 
sales are expected to bring ferranti around 157 million 
in its revised report ferranti provided numerous figures 
updated to reflect its writeoff of assets related to the 338 
million value previously assigned to the phantom contracts at isc 
the writeoff was foreshadowed in ferrantis report to 
shareholders at the end of september when it said it had uncovered 
the full extent of suspected contract irregularities at the 
american subsidiary at that time the company estimated it might 
have to take a writeoff of 2705 million 
ferranti was alerted to the isc problems in august and sent a 
team of accountants to examine the true worth of isc after it 
emerged that contracts the company claimed to have secured with 
pakistan china and a middle eastern country didnt exist 
ferranti previously had no reason to doubt the validity of iscs 
audited accounts and only discovered the fraud in august after some 
trading and management problems had emerged in isc earlier in the 
year alunjones said

the beer gridiron is going to be a busy and 
expensive place on television this january 
the nations two largest brewers anheuser busch cos inc and 
miller brewing co are gearing up to sell their beer with by 
staging mock football games in television commercials in 
conjunction with super bowl xxiv in new orleans 
executives from both companies say theyre attempting to take 
advantage of the weeks of hype surrounding the game both 
beermakers claim their packages are the largest super bowl 
promotions ever with each planning to spend upwards of 7 million 
anheuser busch is staging a bud bowl ii ad campaign that 
culminates during the jan 28 super bowl with a game featuring 
animated teams of budweiser and bud light beer bottles rattling 
around on a pintsized football field the first such game was 
staged during the last super bowl 
were starting a month earlier weve added an extra promo 
spot and were going to have a lot more display materials in the 
stores said tom sharbaugh group brand director for budweiser 
miller based in milwaukee wont say exactly how much it is 
spending on its 12week presuper bowl campaign centered on a 
football game between a tastes great team and a less 
filling squad 
those teams will be made up of current and former national 
football league players such as bert jones lc greenwood and joe 
klecko 
were spending more than 7 million i can tell you that 
said richard burton advertising manager for lite beer were 
talking about reallife talent

a french court canceled its hearing friday on the 
purchase of pathe cinema by italian film mogul giancarlo parretti 
after the government withdrew its objections to the sale 
the paris tribunal of commerce dropped the case after 
determining that the finance ministry and parretti were nearing 
agreement to end their dispute over the venerable cimena chain 
court officials released no details of any moves toward a 
settlement and repeated calls by the associated press to the 
ministry and pathe were not returned 
french financial newspapers reported friday that the ministry 
would no longer contest the sale of pathe to max theret 
investissement mti the parrettiheaded group whose origins have 
been debated for months 
the government has contended that mti acted as a front for the 
genevabased sasea holding company while parretti who owns the 
ailing us cannon film group said his funds came mostly from a 
string of successful business ventures in italy 
the distinction became crucial after mti purchased majority 
shareholdings in pathe last year because switzerland the home of 
sasea is not a member of the 12nation european community 
french law requires that nonec investors seek government 
approval to purchase more than 20 percent of a french concern but 
mti bought a 52 percent stake in pathe directly from the banque 
rivaud and increased its holdings with further purchases from 
minority shareholders 
several scheduled court appearances were postponed over the past 
four months as finance ministry investigators tried to build a case 
against parretti and divine the origin of the funds behind mti 
parretti meanwhile created a new amsterdambased holding company 
called pathe europe and promised to put pathe cinema under its 
control its shareholders include two parretticontrolled 
luxembourg holding companies 
negotiations followed between mti and ministry officials and 
the government reportedly promised to abandon its case if an ec 
character could be established for pathe cinema 
the proposals also involved having the bulk of pathe stock 
revert to previous owners leaving the parretti group with a 
holding of under 20 percent 
last month the european commission in brussels rebuked france 
for blocking the pathe deal and scheduled a hearing before the the 
european court of justice to see what evidence of illegal 
activities french officials could bring against parretti

as one of the nations top stockbrokers boyd l 
jefferies made millions keeping his numbers in the best possible 
order he may have a little more trouble with words 
jefferies finished his stint as a prosecution witness this week 
by saying for the first time in three gaf corp stock manipulation 
trials that he assumed the alleged scheme was directed by gaf 
chairman samuel j heyman 
defense lawyers pounced on the surprise statement as an example 
of numerous discrepancies in testimony by the former los angeles 
broker who cut a deal with federal prosecutors in exchange for 
lenient treatment 
and in an article in the december issue of esquire magazine 
jefferies bluntly states that heyman ordered the alleged 
manipulation and derides the quality of the prosecution 
its such a chickenshit case jefferies is quoted as saying 
based on information from jefferies the government charged gaf 
two subsidiaries and vice chairman james t sherwin with stock 
manipulation and other crimes they allegedly tried to boost union 
carbide corps share price in 1986 shortly before selling a large 
block of carbide shares 
jefferies has waffled sweated stammered and failed to 
recollect during lengthystretches of testimony especially under 
crossexamination from gaf lawyer arthur liman the first two 
trials ended in mistrials 
its very difficult for any man to go through that many 
examinations for that long jefferies lawyer james linn said 
friday he is frustrated and very tired of it i think it showed 
a little 
but linn said theres no real discrepancy on his fundamental 
story that sherwin called jefferies in late october 1986 and 
asked him to raise carbide stock to close at 22 a share 
barring another mistrial jefferies is done testifying he also 
appeared at the trial that convicted investor paul bilzerian and 
provided information for charges against speculator salim b lewis 
who pleaded guilty to stock manipulation on the eve of his trial 
in exchange jefferies pleaded guilty to two felonies after the 
government praised his assistance he was spared jail sentenced to 
probation and fined 250000 the multimillionaire is running a 
golf clinic for youngsters in aspen colo 
jefferies also has a home in palm springs calif where he 
returned friday he didnt immediately return telephone calls 
seeking comment 
in all three gaf trials defense lawyers have attacked 
jefferies credibility calling him an admitted felon testifying to 
save his skin 
the crux of this trial is whether boyd jefferies is or is not 
a truth teller sherwins lawyer stephen kaufman said in a 
closed session in us district judge may johnson lowes chambers 
this week 
in the esquire article jefferies said that after he was 
implicated by nowjailed speculator ivan boesky he remembered 
thinking if theyre going to bring me down for something like 
this im going to bring down a lot of other people with me 
jefferies also was quoted as saying about heyman and the alleged 
gaf manipulation the whole thing was all sams idea sherwin 
doesnt even go to the bathroom without sam telling him to 
liman read some of the quotations in court and jefferies said he 
couldnt recall having made them 
jefferies testified in the second trial that during 
conversations with heyman in tuscon ariz he had no indication 
sherwin was acting on heymans instructions he said the same thing 
this tuesday 
but on wednesday jefferies suddenly said heyman called him to 
see if he could talk to sherwin and discuss something that mr 
heyman knew was illegal and he did not want to have any 
association 
mr heyman is smart he testified he knows the conniving 
and the way to do an illegal transaction and not provide any 
trail 
on thursday he wavered saying he merely assumed heyman knew 
and had instructed sherwin what to do i felt that mr sherwin 
and i had been set up by mr heyman he said 
heyman has not been charged although he was named in the second 
trial as an unindicted coconspirator it was unclear what effect 
jefferies latest testimony would have on the case though some 
lawyers believe it could help sherwins chances of acquittal but 
hurt gaf

seven months after putting its firearms 
division up for sale colt industries inc said friday it had found 
a prospective buyer 
new yorkbased colt didnt identify the potential buyer for its 
two manufacturing plants in hartford and west hartford but there 
was an indication workers who have been on strike since january 
1986 against colt might become the new owners with state assistance 
in making its announcement about a possible buyer colt warned 
950 employees who have replaced the striking unionized workers that 
they face dismissal in january 
negotiations among the parties involved in possible 
acquisition of colt firearms division of colt industries are 
continuing with all due dispatch and vigor and all the parties are 
pleased at the progress of the talks to date past that we have no 
further comment the united auto workers region 9a said in a 
prepared statement 
the statement was signed by region 9a director phil wheeler and 
assistant director robert madore the two leaders in the bitter 
strike at the firearms plants that began on jan 24 1986 
the workers went on strike after failing to obtain a new 
contract about 1050 workers had gone 10 months without a new 
contract before striking since then some of the workers have 
crossed the picket lines and others have found new jobs leaving 
about 800 on the picket line replacement workers were hired to 
fill their jobs 
sturm ruger co of fairfield which had expressed an interest 
in the firearms division said it was defenitely out the the 
picture 
its certainly not us said steve sanetti general counsel 
for sturm ruger he declined further comment citing a 
confidentialy agreement signed by his company when it considered 
making a bid 
officials at smith amp wesson corp a division of tompkins plc in 
srpingfield mass werent immediately available for comment 
richard carr president of tompkins us unit has said his company 
would consider purchase of the colt division 
the value of the potential deal wasnt disclosed by 
privatelyheld colt industries but analysts have said a sale could 
fetch colt betwen 150 million to 200 million the analysts have 
estimated that colt firearms has annual sales at between 75 
million to 100 million with a profit margin at about 17 percent 
in a short announcement colt industries said it had advised 
employees that the company is near agreement to sell the assets 
of the firearm division 
if the sale goes through colt said its two gunmanufacturing 
plants would stop production on or about jan 16 1990 effective 
with the halt of production all workers will be dismissed colt 
said 
the company said however that the new owner plans to resume 
production at the plants and many of the affected employees will 
be contacted by the prospective buyer during the next several weeks 
concerning the availability of jobs 
jon sandberg a spokesman for gov william a oneill said the 
governors office was following the developments sandberg said the 
governor was working to keep the colt jobs in connecticut but 
declined further comment 
colt was founded in hartford in 1836 by samuel colt who 
invented the revolver the firearms division is a leading 
manufacturer of handguns and rifles for military and commercial 
uses products include the wellknown colt 45 pistol the king 
cobra magnum revolver ar15 sport rifle and the m16 military 
rifle 
the company lost its contract with the army to produce the m16 
last year the loss of that contract coupled with the strike 
apparently figured in colts decision to sell the division 
although company officials have denied that the lost contract was a 
factor 
analysts also have estimated that colts debt at around 18 
billion the bulk of the debt was incurred when management mounted 
a 660 million leveraged buyout in 1988 analysts have said 
when the company announced in april that it was seeking a buyer 
the union and firearms division management in connecticut combined 
forces with the state of connecticut and private investors to make 
a bid for the business 
in the past two years more than 300 us companies have been 
acquired by their employees according to joseph r blasi a 
business professor and expert on employee ownership 
the largest employee buyout on record is the one engineered by 
workers at avis who paid 175 billion for the car rental company

transportation secretary samuel skinner on 
friday reiterated his departments opposition to high levels of 
debt in airline takeovers which have swept the industry this year 
many recapitalizations are good they put new blood into the 
company they set standards for performance skinner told an 
airline industry gathering in new york he added however that he 
is concerned that excessive debt resulting from takeovers could 
negatively affect an airlines safety 
while conceding that some foreign investment is essential 
skinner said we have to make sure that national security is not 
compromised by foreign control of us airlines 
under us law foreign airlines arent allowed to own more than 
25 percent of the voting stock of domestic carriers 
last month skinner used his authority to force klm royal dutch 
airlines the foreign partner in the 365 billion buyout of 
northwest airlines parent nwa inc to cut its 400 million 
investment by 225 million 
despite his concern about takeovers skinner said friday he 
doesnt need the new authority to deal with buyouts that a bill in 
congress would give him 
the house recently passed a bill to require government rejection 
of any airline takeover that might affect safety hinder 
competition cut a carriers size affect jobs or result in foreign 
control of an airline 
under the legislation now before the senate the transportation 
secretary would determine whether transactions meet the standards 
before they are completed he also would have the power to approve 
any airline merger if he believes it is in the public interest 
skinner said he would recommend that president bush veto the 
bill if it is sent to him the house vote exceeded the twothirds 
majority necessary to override a veto 
the transportation chief also criticized new proposals in 
congress to reregulate the airline industry 
the concept of reregulation is not a concept i agree with 
skinner told the airline executives and analysts 
he said a study of airline competition by his department due to 
be completed in january will show that such drastic action is not 
warranted although there are small pockets of 
anticompetitiveness 
skinner urged the airlines to forge the same sort of cooperation 
between labor and management that exists in the auto industry 
the days of adversarial striking to the degree it has 
occurred in the past are over he said 
he didnt specifically mention the strike against eastern 
airlines which has continued since early march although the 
carrier has hired replacement workers skinner and bush have 
refused to intervene in the strike as the unions have asked them 
to do

the federal agency that regulates the nations 
futures exchanges said friday it will ask those exchanges to 
restrict the controversial practice of dual trading 
the commodity futures trading commission also released its 
longawaited study of dual trading which involves traders who 
execute trades for themselves and their customers on the same day 
the study found dual traders are not a critical ingredient in 
providing liquidity and lowcost trade execution 
critics of dual trading which is not illegal claim it poses 
conflictofinterest problems for traders who might try to make a 
profit trading for themselves ahead of their customers 
this practice known as frontrunning is banned 
frontrunning is among the many fraud schemes alleged in the 
indictments of more than 40 traders at the nations twolargest 
futures exchanges in chicago this past summer 
based on the study as well as the chicago indictments the cftc 
said its staff was preparing proposed rules that would require 
exchanges to restrict dual trading on a provision phasedin 
basis 
cftc chief economist steven manaster said however that 
developing those rules will be a lengthy process 
legislation that would severely limit dual trading is pending 
before congress 
dual trading exists in all markets the chicago mercantile 
exchange said in a prepared statement adding that the exchange 
after its own study has proposed to deal with any real or 
perceived problems with dual trading through the enhancement of the 
audit trail both the house and senate have also adiopted this 
approach 
an audit trail is an antifraud device to reconstruct a trade to 
determine when it occurred and who was involved 
we will review the cftcs report on dual trading and make 
comments to any proposed rules at the appropriate time the cme 
statement concluded 
futures contracts are agreements to deliver a quantity of goods 
at a specified price at a certain time in the future futures 
contracts are used by producers of such commodities as soybeans or 
gold to lock in a favorable price down the road 
and speculators in turn buy and sell those contracts to profit 
from constantly changing price differences 
supporters of dual trading claim it helps keep trading costs 
down and keeps the markets liquid when there is little trading 
especially in small lowvolume markets 
it had been argued that dual traders might be superior 
providers of liquidity or that dual traders might be superior in 
terms providing customer service and on that basis were kind of 
super traders they were absolutely essential to whatever was 
going on in these markets said manaster 
but he noted the 47page study conducted by the cftcs division 
of economic analysis found that the vast majority of dual 
traders tend to specialize in trading either for themselves or for 
their customers dual trading is really a sideline for most floor 
traders constituting only about 10 percent or less of their 
business 
the study also found that 
there is no statistical support for claims that dual trading 
increases in lowvolume months 
dual traders do not on average get better quality trades 
for their cusrtomers than brokers who trade only for customers 
dual traders do not help make the market any more liquid than 
exclusive traders or those who dont engage in dual trading 
on the basis of the study i think we have a reasonable idea 
of what may happen and in particular dual traders are not a 
unique super trader and it seems reasonable that their 
contribution to the market organization could be substituted for by 
exclusive traders or brokers said manaster

precious metals futures prices rose broadly friday supported by 
continued investor buying of gold silver and platinum and by 
supply fears in the palladium market linked to reports of problems 
at soviet nickel refinery 
gold closed near its high for the week prompting predictions by 
analysts that it will test the psychologically important 
400anounce level next week 
on other commodity markets copper sank to fourmonth lows

on the new york mercantile exchange platinum futures settled 
520 to 6 higher with january at 52660 a troy ounce palladium 
ended 325 to 4 higher with december at 14560 a troy ounce 
the latest gains fit with a bullish trend in precious metals 
prices that began last month and which analysts have attributed 
largely to buying by investors fleeing the turbulent stock market 
the rally which began on the london market before the new york 
markets opened defied expectations for a drop in prices following 
thursdays weak finish 
what impressed me is that the market wasnt taken lower

general electric co on friday announced a 
shareholderpleasing plan to spend excess cash on the biggest 
single stock repurchase program in us corporate history 10 
billion over five years 
the action coupled with a 15 percent increase in dividends was 
aimed at satisfying investors who complained the company has not 
been using the money it generates to benefit shareholders 
weve looked at all the alternatives and reached the 
conclusion that ge stock is the best investment we can make john 
f welch jr ges chairman said in a statement 
ge rose 2 a share to 5950 on the new york stock exchange 
helping to support the overall stock market the stock had already 
risen about 3 a share earlier in the week on speculation of some 
kind of announcement to benefit shareholders 
the repurchase authorized by the board of directors would amount 
to about 20 percent of ges stock at current prices taking stock 
off the market benefits shareholders because profits are spread 
over fewer shares 
this affirms to us that the company really believes that the 
stock is cheap said robert spremulli an investment officer for 
the college retirement equities fund a major pension fund and ge 
stockholder 
ges 10 billion total buyback is by far the biggest announced 
at one time but it is spread out over five years other companies 
have announced a succession of shorterterm buybacks that total 
billions of dollars the closest in a single announcement was 
atlantic richfield co with 4 billion in 1985 
ges announcement caps a decade of massive and successful 
restructuring in which the company has sold off numerous businesses 
and bought others in order to focus on 13 key industries from 
lighting broadcasting and medical equipment to financial services 
aircraft engines and plastics 
welch the chairman said ge was not ruling out another 
multibilliondollar acquisition in the 1990s but he said the 
company was much more likely to stick with the businesses it has 
adding bits and pieces to them 
the only acquisition that could halt the buyback he said would 
be one on the order of rca which ge bought for 64 billion in 
1986 that is a massive acquisition that fit exactly right down 
the pipeline 
ge said shares would be repurchased in the open market with 
funds from a combination of borrowings and cash generated by its 
businesses it said the company reserved the right to halt or slow 
the buyback at any time 
ge said it had reviewed the share repurchase plan with the 
rating debtrating agencies and that they had confirmed ges triple 
a debt rating 
at moodys investors service inc analyst alfred pastore said 
theyre pretty sharp people and we feel theyre going to do the 
right thing with the money not spend it foolishly 
the huge buyback provoked questions about whether ge was being 
too conservative with its money when it could be using it to buy 
other companies or build existing businesses 
but analyst linda shuman of prudentialbache securities inc 
said ge had come under heat from institutional investors for the 
exact opposite reason putting money into risky investments instead 
of returning it to shareholders 
theres inherent risk in acquisitions the risk that you 
overpay the risk that it doesnt work out she said 
they will still have enough funds available to grow 
internally said russell leavitt of salomon brothers inc in 
the products that ge is involved in i think they will remain fully 
competitive on a world scale 
the dividend increase brings the quarterly dividend to 47 cents 
a share and ge said it would keep raising dividends in line with 
increases in earnings per share

design changes on a new antisubmarine 
patrol plane will force lockheed corp to report a pretax loss of 
about 300 million in the fourth quarter and possibly a loss for 
the year lockheed said friday 
the big aerospace company has been building fixedwing maritime 
surveillance planes since world war ii for the navy which plans to 
spend between 4 billion and 5 billion to buy 125 of the new p7a 
planes 
lockheed said the cost of developing the p7a had risen because 
its design will be less like that of its predecessor lockheeds 
p3c orion than expected 
despite big changes in the wings body and engine the new 
planes wingspan is 7 feet longer than the old one for example 
and top takeoff weight is 156600 pounds up from 139700 pounds 
the company had hoped it would be able to keep many parts of the 
structure unchanged 
we originally had thought that something over 50 percent of 
the structure might be common to the p3 said lockheed spokesman 
jim ragsdale 
stress analysis proved different we dont know what the 
actual percentage is going to be but its going to be far lower 
than that ragsdale said 
lockheed stock fell 212 a share to 3950 in trading on the 
new york stock exchange 
lockheed has been building p3s since 1962 and is to deliver the 
last p3 to the navy in mid1991 it had hoped to have the p7a in 
production by late 1992 ragsdale said it was unclear how much the 
design changes would delay production 
the writeoff of about 300 million covers all the extra 
development costs that are expected over the next several years 
and lockheed expects to show a profit once production of the p7as 
gets under way said daniel m tellep the companys chairman 
tellep said in a statement that the exact amount of the writeoff 
wouldnt be known until after more studies and review by the navy 
he didnt say how long that would take but in a memo from the 
aerospace companys burbank facilities to p7a workers lockheed 
said it would immediately launch a threemonth to fivemonth 
reassessment of the program 
the p7a is now viewed as an almost new design the memo 
said 
some activities will be temporarily suspended until revised 
plans can be set in place and approved by the customer lockheed 
told the workers we are confident the program will be continued 
and will meet its objectives 
for its third quarter ending sept 31 lockheed lost 32 million 
on sales of 21 billion compared to a profit of 123 million on 
sales of 23 billion for the same quarter a year earlier for the 
first nine months of the year lockheed earned 108 million on 
sales of 66 billion compared to 333 million on sales of 72 
billion in the same period in 1988

lj hooker corp unable to find a buyer for 
its b altman department stores said friday it would close six of 
the chains seven branches 
hooker said the move which will include the companys flagship 
manhattan store was approved by the us bankruptcy court 
overseeing the companys reorganization 
hooker is owned by the australian developer hooker corp which 
has been unable to handle its massive debt load and been forced to 
liquidate itself 
last month lj hooker said it had received a 409 million cash 
offer from an investor group for the companys three regional 
shopping malls shopping centers a large atlanta office building 
and undeveloped land in several states it also included lj 
hooker international inc a commercial real estate brokerage 
the offer did not include the altman stores and hooker had said 
it would close the chain if it did not find a buyer for them by 
friday 
we just couldnt wait any longer given our fiduciary 
responsibility to the companys creditors and other business 
entities said sanford c sigoloff hookers chief executive 
hooker said the altman store in a hooker mall outside cincinnati 
would remain open the company also owns the bonwit teller 
specialty store chain and has said it would keep those stores open 
hooker had been trying to sell the altman branches while several 
other big us department stores also were on the block 
canadas campeau corp another developer that has run into 
financial trouble because of its retail acquisitions plans to sell 
its bloomingdales chain meanwhile bat industries plc plans to 
sell its marshall field and saks fifth avenue chains as part of its 
defense against an unwanted takeover bid in britain 
retail industry analysts have said hooker and campeau took on 
too much debt and underestimated the volatility of the us 
retailing industry when they made their acquisitions 
campeau chairman robert campeau was forced to surrender control 
of his company to fellow developers olympia amp york recently in 
return for financial aid to keep his company afloat campeau paid 
34 billion for allied stores corp and 66 billion for federated 
department stores inc going heavily into debt to finance the two 
deals 
the retailing industry has had a generally disappointing 
performance in recent years and hooker and campeau stores have 
been unable to generate the cash flow the companies needed to pay 
their debts 
when both companies made their acquisitions analysts said the 
firms were more interested in the real estate they acquired rather 
than the retailing businesses 
the investors bidding for most of hookers assets are led by the 
shidler group and the simpson organization inc the group was 
assembled by the londonbased investment banking company hoare 
govett a subsidiary of security pacific corp 
besides the manhattan store located in a landmark building 
across from the empire state building the altman branches being 
closed are in white plains and manhasset two new york city 
suburbs paramus and short hills nj and st davids pa

a federal appeals court friday cleared the way 
for restoration of rules designed to prevent cable tv systems from 
showing syndicated programs that local tv stations also might be 
showing 
the unanimous ruling by a threejudge panel of the us circuit 
court of appeals for the district of columbia could mean that tv 
viewers will get fewer chances to view some of their favorite 
syndicated shows starting jan 1 
syndicated shows are those not controlled by a network but made 
available by their producers to stations independently frequently 
they are reruns of previous network hits like mash 
the court upheld a 1988 decision by the federal communications 
commission to reinstate its socalled syndicated exclusivity rules 
that the agency had lifted in 1980 to help boost the cable tv 
industry 
the rules allow local overtheair stations to contract with 
program suppliers for the exclusive rights in their broadcast areas 
cable operators retransmit local broadcasters signals while 
also importing the signals of national superstations such 
as wtbs of atlanta new york citys wor in new york and wgn from 
chicago in some cases that means a cable system will be showing 
green acres for instance from a superstation as well as a 
local tv station 
cable operator steven j simmons chairman of simmons 
communications inc said in an interview last month that 
broadcasters around the country have indicated they will claim 
exclusvity for the oprah winfrey show whos the boss 
wheel of fortune mash i love lucy golden girls 
donahue and other programs 
broadcasters claim program duplication reduces their audiences 
and their advertising revenues while giving broadcasters less 
incentive to develop syndicated programming 
the appeals court in an opinion written by chief judge patricia 
m wald denied challenges to the rules from cable companies and 
industry organizations that claimed they were arbitrary and 
violated federal law and cable operators first amendment rights 
the petitioners also said the copmmission had not compiled 
adequate statistics to back up its decision to bring back the 
syndication rules 
wald in a stinging rejection of the first amendment argument 
said the cable companies were claiming that they have a first 
amendment right to express themselves using the copyrighted 
materials of others 
she said the fcc was surely justified in concluding that 
duplication of programming diverts a substantial portion of the 
broadcast audience to cable 
the commission reasonably inferred that diversion lessened the 
value of the programming by lowering advertising revenues wald 
wrote she noted that cable programmers themselves boast of the 
exclusive rights they have to certain programs and that the 
evidence is that all stations broadcast and cable want 
exclusivity 
wald said the fcc was justified in changing its mind on syndex 
from 1980 to 1988 during that period the fraction of homes with 
cable grew from 19 percent to 51 percent while cable advertising 
revenues climbed from 455 million to more than 1 billion 
john cole an attorney for united video one of the challengers 
said he was disappointed 
national association of broadcasters president edward o fritts

the senate ethics committee will hire an 
outside counsel to investigate five senators who received large 
campaign contributions from the head of a failed thrift institution 
and intervened with regulators on his behalf a source said 
thursday 
there was no indication from the source who spoke only on 
condition of anonymity whether the committee had decided on an 
individual to investigate sens alan cranston dcalif dennis 
deconcini dariz john glenn dohio john mccain rariz and 
donald riegle dmich 
the new york times said in friday editions the committee had 
chosen prominent washington lawyer robert s bennett for the job 
and also for another investigating sen alfonse damato rny in 
an unrelated case bennett was hired earlier this year for yet a 
third committee investigation 
bennett was away from home for the evening 
the five senators in the sampl case intervened with banking 
regulators examining lincoln savings and loan of irvine calif 
whose chairman charles h keating gave the senators direct and 
indirect campaign contributions in the mid1980s 
a standing senate order says that ethics committee 
investigations shall be conducted by outside counsel unless 
the select committee determines not to use outside counsel 
the congressional watchdog common cause had urged the outside 
counsel so that the results of the inquiry would be credible and 
accepted by the public 
earlier this year the house ethics committee hired an outside 
counsel to press its case against thenspeaker jim wright dtexas 
that lawyer richard phelan of chicago became the focal point of 
wrights counterattack to try to save his job wright resigned in 
june 
over the summer the senate panel appointed bennett to look into 
accusations that sen david durenberger rminn laundered 
100000 in campaign contributions through a book contract 
according to a durenberger announcement in august 
first word of the decision to seek a counsel thursday came from 
cbs news 
meanwhile cranston told the ethics committee thursday he 
violated no laws ethical standards or senate rules in meeting with 
federal regulators on behalf of lincoln 
the committee should determine that no further action is 
warranted the senate democratic whip said in a formal response 
prepared by his attorney to a monthold inquiry by the ethics 
committee 
in an accompanying letter to its chairman and vice chairman 
cranston said his inquiries to the federal home loan bank board 
about lincoln were nothing more and nothing less than what he 
has done for other constituents with credible complaints about 
their treatment by a federal agency 
cranston is the third of five senators to respond to the ethics 
panels inquiry the five received a total of 13 million in 
contributions to their campaigns and other political causes from 
keating 
cranstons spokesman murray flander said he had no further 
comment on the committees thursday decision we have no 
firsthand knowledge of it flander said 
telephones for spokesmen for riegle were not answered 
mccain said in a statement i think the appointment is a 
positive step and i am confident that an investigation will 
vidictae my repeated statements that i never absued my office nor 
took actions that were improper 
deconcini issued a statement saying i welcome anything that 
will establish the facts and i will cooperate fully 
glenns aide dale butland said in columbus ohio the senator 
has not been notified of this 
cranston was among four senators who met with then bank board 
chairman edwin gray on april 2 1987 and five senators who met a 
week later with regional officials from the boards san francisco 
office about lincoln 
cranston also phoned grays successor m danny wall last 
spring endorsing keatings failed attempt to sell lincoln before 
regulators obtained a court order to seize it 
the ethics panel was asked last month by common cause to 
initiate the inquiry after midlevel sampl regulators told the house 
banking committee their efforts to shut lincoln down in early 1987 
were thwarted by keatings political influence 
regulators seized control of lincoln only last april they 
estimate taxpayers will have to cover between 2 billion and 25 
billion in federally insured deposits the thrift lost in the 
biggest sampl failure in history and have filed a 11 billion fraud 
and racketeering suit against keating and his associates 
in addition hundreds of the 22000 bondholders who bought 
highrisk debentures in lincolns holding co american continental 
corp of phoenix through lincoln branches have sued keating after 
losing an estimated 200 million 
cranston received 35000 in direct campaign gifts from keating 
and his associates keating also contributed another 850000 to 
california voter registration campaigns headed by cranstons son 
and cranston was instrumental in raising nearly 89000 through 
keating for the california democratic party 
i am not responsible for loss of taxpayer funds through a 
delay in shutting down lincoln or the losses of innocent california 
bond investors cranston said in his letter to sens howell 
heflin dala and warren b rudman rnh the chairman and vice 
chairman of the ethics panel 
i never attempted to derail any investigation of wrongdoing at 
lincoln nor did i ever suggest to chairman gray chairman wall or 
any other official that an investigation be delayed cranston 
said 
deconcini and riegle have sent similar responses to the ethics 
panel glenn and mccain have not yet filed formal responses but 
have denied any wrongdoing 
cranston said he attended the april 2 meeting with gray because 
keating had told him lincoln was being treated unfairly by the bank 
board in a yearlong examination 
bolstering keatings complaint cranston said were statements 
by lincolns auditor and alan greenspan now chairman of the 
federal reserve board but then a private consultant retained by 
keating that the thrift and its investments were sound
