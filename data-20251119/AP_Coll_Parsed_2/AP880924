as a student recruiter for the american civil 
liberties union young michael dukakis found an unwitting and 
unlikely ally in sen joseph mccarthy 
the place was swarthmore college the time was the mid1950s 
and mccarthys redbaiting rampages his fulminations about 
cardcarrying communists had galvanized civil libertarians 
mccarthy was our greatest membership recruiter dukakis 
recalled in an interview last may with the los angeles times 
no one is likely to describe george bush as an aclu recruiter 
but officials of the civil liberties union say he too is helping 
draw members money and mail to the organizations cluttered times 
square headquarters 
bush has persistently attacked dukakis for being a member of the 
aclu and has turned dukakis tongueincheek description of 
himself as a cardcarrying member on its head 
the organization is fighting back it is planning an advertising 
campaign featuring actors michael tucker and jill eikenberry of 
la law and burt lancaster to battle what it says are 
misrepresentations by the bush campaign 
theres a smell of mccarthyism about those kinds of attacks 
aclu executive director ira glasser said in a recent interview 
and while that has happened from time to time from people like ed 
meese and jesse helms and strom thurmond it has never before 
been leveled during a presidential campaign by a major party 
candidate 
should membership be an issue in a presidential race 
aclu officials say no in their view the aclu is a 
nonpartisan nonideological organization whose sole function is 
to defend the constitution and the bill of rights an attack on the 
aclu they say is an attack on the very foundations of democracy 
but others mainly conservatives say the aclu is not the 
politically neutral organization it claims to be but a leftwing 
criminals lobby to use the phrase favored by former attorney 
general edwin meese iii 
they are probably one of the most rigidly ideological 
organizations in the country said dan casey executive director 
of the american conservative union 
attorney general dick thornburgh stung by a newspaper column 
which noted his past membership in the aclu issued a statement 
thursday saying he left the organization because it had a 
separate political agenda many portions of which i strongly 
disagreed with 
the aclu and the reagan administration tangled frequently 
the aclu for the first time took a position on the 
appointment of a supreme court justice when it opposed the 
nomination of robert bork 
the aclu strongly supports the supreme court decision which 
established a womans right to abortion 
the aclu was on the losing side in a 1987 case in which the 
supreme court on a 63 vote supported pretrial detention of 
suspects who are determined to be dangerous 
the aclu lost again this year when the supreme court upheld 
the adolescent family life act aclu attorneys had objected that 
money was given to groups which were promoting religious positions 
but the reagan administration is not the first to battle the 
aclu the organization was founded in 1920 in response to the 
palmer raids the name given to attorney general a mitchell 
palmers efforts to deport immigrants for their radical beliefs 
the organization has defended all sorts of radicals from the 
communist party to the nazi party from the black panthers to the 
ku klux klan to hold and espouse their beliefs 
the aclu has successfully argued that poor people have the right 
to a lawyer and that police should inform criminal suspects of 
their right to remain silent 
meese often attacked the supreme courts 1966 miranda decision 
that required police to read suspects their rights meese once said 
the ruling only helps guilty defendants 
one past supreme court case which figures in this presidential 
campaign is one in which the aclu sided with jehovahs witnesses 
who challenged a law which compelled them to join in the pledge of 
allegiance the supreme court in 1943 struck down the law and 
that decision was cited by dukakis when he vetoed a massachusetts 
bill that required teachers to lead the pledge every day 
the courts decision in the pledge of allegiance case contained 
probably the most ringing language of any supreme court decision 
on why the constitution forbids the state from telling people to 
take oaths glasser said 
the words are fine liberty justice indivisible we love 
those words those words might be the motto of the aclu 
many of the aclus causes have been unpopular glasser said 
because the government tends to target unpopular groups 
you know we dont choose our clients he said if we are 
representing more people on the left its because the government 
is prosecuting more people on the left 
casey however believes the aclu has a mindset of blaming the 
actions of criminals on society its a mindset where the system of 
justice favors criminals over the lawabiding citizens its a view 
of an extraordinarily libertine society that could probably best be 
summed up by the phrase if it feels good do it and dont make it 
illegal 
glasser puts it this way if i were to asked to characterize 
what the constitution means in a single line i would say its 
the right to be let alone its the notion that the government has 
power to do certain things like protect us against foreign 
domination maintain the streets tax us for various things but 
they dont have the right to tell me how to live

fishermen preparing to catch alaskas 
premium crab next week face a harvest projected to be 40 percent 
below last years which could produce a quantum jump in prices and 
put a pinch on restaurant owners 
state biologists said they were surprised to discover data 
showing a shortfall of red king crab after anticipating a 
burgeoning harvest for the bristol bay fishing grounds this year 
they had projected a 20 percent to 30 percent increase in the 1988 
haul over the 1987 take of 123 million pounds 
but when the harvest opens sunday it will draw at least 200 
boats competing for an estimated 75 million pounds of crab said 
ken griffin an alaska department of fish and game biologist the 
harvest will likely last less than seven days he said 
the crab industry is 30 million business griffin said 
biologists suspect a variety of causes for the instability in 
the population of the red king crab which is available only off 
the alaska coast 
the bristol bay fishing area off alaskas southwest coast 
yielded a peak harvest of 139 million pounds in 1980 but for 
reasons still not understood the crab population was decimated in 
1982 and the fishery was not opened that year 
the harvest that begins this weekend will be the years major 
catch of the seafood which vies with coldwater lobster tails as a 
premium item on restaurant menus in the united states and abroad 
demand is very strong both domestically and in japan said 
john martin a shellfish promotion specialist for the alaska 
seafood marketing institute 
but a massive increase in prices could scare restaurateurs to 
the point that they substitute less costly seafood as 
topoftheline fare martin said 
the best thing thats happened in the king crab business in 
the last two years has been the stability of the prices he said 
thursday 
as long as we offer a highquality product at competitive 
prices red king crab is very popular he said it brought 10 
to 12 a pound wholesale in 1987 
brown and blue king crabs also are harvested off the alaska 
coast but are valued less than their red cousin 
griffin said biologists dont know exactly why the supply 
plunged influences that have been examined include interference 
from bottomfishing disease increased water temperature and 
harvests of undersized crab 
officials are combatting the harvest of the smaller crabs with a 
state law requiring monitors to travel aboard vessels processing 
crab at sea where previously they had been been unable to observe 
the catch that law similar to a federal measure for some of the 
vessels in foreign fleets requires observers to verify the 
quantities and sizes of crab caught 
but some fishermen balked at the law and unsuccessfully sought 
an injunction to block the requirement for monitors an attorney 
for the association of atsea crab processors said thursday that 
the refusal to grant the injunction this week was not appealed and 
processors were preparing to carry monitors 
attorney mike stanley of juneau estimated that contractors who 
provide the monitors will pass on about 9000 in costs to each 
processor required to use one

the four antiapartheid 
activists who have taken refuge in the us consular offices are 
testing the diplomatic skills of their hosts 
since the first three activists escaped 12 days ago to consular 
sanctuary 11 stories above downtown johannesburg the activists 
have demanded the release of all detainees and an end to south 
africas state of emergency 
the whitedominated south african government in contrast to its 
usual confrontational tactics has waged a public relations 
campaign to make itself appear reasonable 
it says the first escapees wellknown antiapartheid leaders 
who were in custody at least 14 months without charge are free to 
walk away without fear of arrest 
they are free men and we have no further interest in them 
whatsoever said leon mellet the law and order ministry 
spokesman 
police say the fourth man who escaped last wednesday faces a 
possible charge of illegal weapons possession 
each of the four escaped from johannesburg hospital where 
police kept them under guard through use of national emergency laws 
that give authorities powers to limit among other things freedom 
of speech press and assembly 
so far us diplomats have said the activists can remain 
indefinitely but they also have barred them from direct contact 
with journalists 
john dugard a human rights lawyer in johannesburg supported 
the activists demand for written assurances they will not be 
harmed but doubted the government would hold to its pledge to leave 
them alone 
i dont believe that for a moment dugard said but it 
might be argued that by staying in the consulate they are 
restricting themselves 
mellet said tthe three have become an embarrassment not only 
for themselves but for the americans as well 
south african officials have issued one mild complaint about the 
us decision to provide temporary refuge but stronger comments 
have come from black activist winnie mandela and sen edward 
kennedy 
kennedy said thursday in washington the escapees provide 
compelling evidence that the people of south africa in their 
struggle to end apartheid still look to the american people for 
support 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services 
the escapees are murphy morobe and mohammed valli moosa senior 
leaders of the banned united democratic front a nationwide 
antiapartheid coalition and vusi khanyile chairman of the banned 
national education crisis committee 
they were joined wednesday by clifford ngcobo an activist from 
soweto who alleges he was assaulted by police following his 
detention in april 
this is the first publicized sanctuary case at a us mission in 
south africa although there have been comparable cases at other 
missions 
six activists stayed at the british consulate in durban for 
several weeks in 1984 before emerging to face arrest for high 
treason the charges later were withdrawn 
in 1987 south africa allowed a dutchman klaus de jonge to 
return to the netherlands after being holed up in a dutch embassy 
office in pretoria for two years de jonge escaped into the office 
after being arrested for aiding the outlawed african national 
congress 
the us embassy has expressed high regard for the activists 
and promised they would not be forced out of the consulate but 
subsequent us statements have been politically neutral 
belittling neither the activists nor south african authorities 
edward perkins the first black us ambassador to south africa 
has engaged in behindthescenes negotiations about the standoff 
but has made no public comments in keeping with the low profile he 
has maintained throughout his two years here 
supporters of the escapees while grateful for the sanctuary at 
the consulate have voiced annoyance at the americans efforts to 
minimize controversy 
said mrs mandela wife of jailed african national congress 
leader nelson mandela we would like to see the americans a 
little more committed than they are 
one us official said the americans relieved because the 
criticism from militants could have been a lot stronger

an uneasy ceasefire in the iraniraq war 
has held for more than a month despite daily claims of violations 
by both sides 
although the guns have fallen silent after one of the longest 
conventional wars this century both sides remain on a war footing 
and the bloodshed continues as they turn on internal opponents to 
settle old scores 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini told his countrymen aug 30 that 
we must take it that we are still at war and urged them to man 
the frontlines against constant plots by our enemies 
diplomats say iraqi president saddam hussein who used the war 
to consolidate his power and eliminate any challenges will have to 
keep the lid on tight to curb any dissent that might emerge 
he has already taken advantage of the aug 20 ceasefire to turn 
his army toward the longrebellious kurdish guerrillas who fought 
on irans side 
the autonomyseeking kurds say the iraqis have killed at least 
4300 civilians in poison gas attacks in a major offensive in 
northern iraq the guerrillas say it is aimed at wiping out kurdish 
resistance 
irans sudden acceptance on july 18 of the un ceasefire has 
intensified political friction between rival factions in tehran 
that is part of a power struggle that has been building up over 
who will take power when ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 88 and 
reported ailing dies 
not all iranian leaders particularly hardline radicals wanted 
to end the war many iranians were bewildered by tehrans sudden 
turnaround after eight years of sacrifice destruction and more 
than 1 million casualties 
khomeini who said that endorsing the ceasefire was more 
deadly than poison clearly sought to head off a political 
backlash by defending government leaders 
they enjoy my confidence he said do not blame them for 
the decision which they have adopted for them too such a 
suggestion has been difficult and unpalatable 
philip robbins an iran specialist with londons royal institute 
for international affairs said that with the ceasefire unity in 
iran is likely to disappear 
with peace talks in geneva stalled by the deep distrust and 
hatred between iran and iraq some western analysts fear the 
conflict could flare up again if negotiations do not produce a 
comprehensive settlement 
neither side has made any move to demobilize their armies 
irans official media reports almost daily that fresh units of 
volunteers have been sent to the front 
diplomats in baghdad say the iraqis remain deeply skeptical of 
irans acceptance of the ceasefire after a year of prevaricating 
and believe tehran is only buying time to rebuild its forces for 
another round of fighting 
analysts believe iran would need at least two years to do that 
they said that when the fighting stopped iran was desperately 
short of aircraft tanks tank engines and even artillery shells 
iran accepted the ceasefire only after baghdad in a chain of 
lightning offensives between april and july recaptured all the 
land iran had seized in the previous six years 
that robbed tehran of an important bargaining chip in peace 
negotiations and left the iranian military in disarray 
don kerr an analyst with the londonbased international 
institute for strategic studies said in a telephone interview 
while the talks go on the iranians are regrouping and rearming 
their forces as best they can 
if they see no particular indications that the truce will do 
something for them id expect to see them starting up the war 
again somehow 
but that may depend on who comes out on top in tehran at 
present parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani who seeks to end 
irans selfimposed isolation appears to have the upper hand 
but he is opposed by hardliners led by prime minister hussein 
musavi and interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi who fear the 
truce has weakened irans revolution

iraq claims it won the persian gulf war 
with iran but officials increasingly suspect they are losing the 
peace 
a string of iraqi battlefield victories this year devastated 
irans war machine and apparently forced the islamic republic to 
accept a un ceasefire it had rejected for nearly a year 
but iraqs demand for a permanent settlement of the 8yearold 
conflict is stalled in unmediated peace talks international 
condemnation of iraqs alleged use of outlawed chemical weapons 
against kurdish rebels has put the oountry on the diplomatic 
defensive 
the present situation is in irans favor not iraqs 
defense minister adnan khairallah complained last week during a 
news conference with foreign reporters last week diplomats agree 
the only card they have on the iranians is military advantage 
and how do they use it one western diplomat commented 
theyre in a dilemma 
iraq claims iran does not want peace just a breathing space to 
rebuild its army before resuming efforts to spread its islamic 
revolution 
the nopeace nowar situation also leaves iraq unable to use 
its only seaports deeply frustrating iraqi rulers who have made 
renewed shipping a priority 
iraqi suspicions were roused by irans wartime vows to spread 
its fundamentalist revolution throughout the moslem world and by 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis remark that accepting the ceasefire 
was more deadly to me than poison 
ironically iraq and its arab allies demanded the un 
ceasefire measure when iraq was on the defensive and iranian 
troops were hammering at the southern port city of basra 
between april and july iraqi troops recaptured all the 
territory they had lost to the iranians over the previous six years 
and even pushed into iran they claimed to have captured half of 
irans tank force 
iraqi negotiators headed to the unsponsored peace talks in 
geneva vowing to negotiate on the basis of victory but their 
efforts to capitalize on military success has been frustrated 
the iranians have given nothing absolutely zero at the 
peace talks the western diplomat said 
the talks have bogged down over iraqs demand that its two 
southern ports be put back in business immediately and that 
sovereignty over the shattalarab waterway the southern border 
between the two countries be renegotiated 
silt and the hulks of halfsunken ships block both the ports at 
basra and umm qasr which lies west of the shattalarab and the 
political deadlock is delaying the lengthy task of clearing them 
khairallah said that leaves iran free to use its other ports 
further south down the gulf while iraq is deprived of its own a 
situation that leaves iraq worse off than it was before the war 
broke out in september 1980 
president saddam hussein said recently that if iraq cannot use 
its ports iran should not be able to use its ports 
khairallah said that while renewed warfare was unlikely if the 
deadlock in talks persists this might lead to fighting 
the ceasefire also gave iraq a free hand against kurdish 
insurgents deprived of their iranian ally 
that iraqi military operation against the kurds succeeded but 
at the cost of rousing massive international condemnation of iraq 
over allegations it used chemical weapons 
the criticism fueled iraqs obsessive fear that the superpowers 
and other nations will tilt their policies toward iran bolstering 
its foe in future military or political clashes 
the chemical weapons furor also threatens to torpedo improving 
iraqi relations with the united states and the west which iraq had 
hoped can help rebuild it warbattered economy 
said one diplomat theyve just seen all that shot out from 
under them

the prodemocracy campaign has made daily 
life a constant struggle in the capital where residents try to 
cope with triggerhappy soldiers and the spiraling price of the 
staple food rice 
i lived in rangoon before world war ii during the war and 
after the war up to now this is the worst period in my life 
said aye maung about 65 life in rangoon is now like hell 
residents have heard gunfire nearly every night presumably 
soldiers fighting protesters since military commander gen saw 
maung seized power one week ago 
the government said 263 people including 238 civilians have 
been killed since sundays coup western diplomats put the death 
toll as high as 400 
with soldiers looters and others roaming the lawless streets 
residents have been cordoning off their homes and few dare violate 
the 8 pm to 4 am curfew 
even in daytime people are afraid to go out for strolls 
said one resident who spoke on condition of anonymity 
rangoon has not been asias most comfortable capital since gen 
ne win ended burmese democracy in a 1962 coup and began a ruinous 
26year path along the burmese way to socialism 
graceful buildings from the british colonial era have decayed 
from neglect the primitive transportation system was overtaxed and 
only a thriving black market kept the economy afloat a un report 
has described rangoon as asias most ratinfested city 
ne win resigned on july 23 after a wave of prodemocracy 
demonstrations and a quick succession of three new leaders long 
associated with him has failed to quell the antigovernment 
sentiment 
a general strike since aug 8 has closed most businesses and 
paralyzed the government as civil servants symphathetic to the 
protesters stayed off the job 
residents who have gone weeks without a paycheck are preoccupied 
with scraping together enough money for rice 
the price of a kilogram 22 pounds of rice has tripled since 
july to 250 forcing perhaps more than half of rangoon 
populations to eat rice porridge or sweet potatoes instead of rice 
gasoline prices have shot up as refineries closed and military 
and government departments stock up virtually the only way to get 
gasoline is through the black market a gallon costs about 21 
five times the price in august 
ironically the capitals supply of electricity has become less 
erratic because government factories that are major users have been 
shut by the general strike 
all banks have been closed so even the rich have problems 
getting by hawkers of black market goods who previously ran 
thriving businesses have trouble getting customers even with big 
discounts other businessmen such as small manufacturers and 
repairmen also find they no longer have a market for nonessential 
goods and services 
people dont come to repair their cars theres no gasoline 
said chein an automobile mechanic i had to terminate the 
services of my four assistants i tried to sell my car at any price 
because i need money but nobody is buying the car is now 
useless 
only small roadside foodstalls seem to be doing some business 
most popular forms of entertainment have disappeared the 
usually packed downtown cinemas have been eerily quiet since early 
august when troops fired on demonstrators in the area large 
restaurants also are closed 
staterun radio and television have featured military songs and 
war documentaries since the coup sunday and popular american 
television programs such as starsky and hutch and hart to 
hart have been taken off the air 
but some people say they will put up with the hardships in the 
struggle for democracy 
sein aye who works at the government port authority said he 
last drew his 50 monthly salary in august he says he will defy 
the new governments orders to return to work by oct 3 on threat 
of dismissal 
i dont know whether i will get it this month with the banks 
closed with food prices rising and no security in town life is 
horrible he said 
but i wont go back to work even if they sack me i will get 
it back when a new government comes

here is the text of the democrats response to 
president reagans weekly radio address 
this is dale bumpers senator from arkansas 
democracy only works if people demand an accounting of those 
elected officials in whom they have placed their trust based on 
their promises if we allow ourselves to be deceived allow our 
attention to be diverted or simply engage in the cynicism that 
political promises arent made to be kept anyway then we all lose 
you recall ronald reagans big promise in 1980 that he would 
double defense spending cut taxes by 30 percent and balance the 
budget a broken promise 
in 1984 they said its morning in america and it sure is 
every morning the us treasury has to print 575 million in new 
money just for interest to keep the government afloat that day and 
if you dont remember anything else i say remember this the 
deficit will be 150 billion this year and 135 billion of that is 
just for interest on that part of the national debt added by this 
administration 
now comes george bush betting he can fool 51 percent of 
americas voters until election day that they wont know or care 
that todays prosperity has come at an unbelievable burden to our 
children 
and he wants more debt he says he wants billions more to deal 
with the drug problems and you and i agree that the drug problem is 
enormous but when you ask him where the moneys coming from he 
says read my lips no new taxes 
he wants billions more for defense including star wars at a 
possible cost of 1 trillion but when you ask where the moneys 
coming from he says read my lips 
after this administration steadfastly opposed a day care bill 
that would give working mothers the peace of mind that comes from 
knowing their children are well cared for while theyre at work 
george bush read the polls saw the gender gap and quickly proposed 
his own 2 billion day care bill and when asked where the money 
was coming from he said read my lips 
he says he wants to be known as an education president yet you 
will remember this administration wanted to make ketchup a 
vegetable on school lunches and vigorously attacked student loans 
and grants that give less fortunate children an opportunity for a 
college education 
now george bush holds himself out as an environmentalist and 
conservationist but where was he while this administration 
indulged james watts rape ruin and run policies until he 
became an unbearable political burden this administration just 
discovered acid rain three months ago for george bush to pose as 
an environmentalist is like bonnie and clyde posing as bank 
examiners 
george bush says judgment is everything in the oval office and 
democrats agree wholeheartedly so when this country was secretly 
selling arms to the ayatollah and cynically warning every other 
nation not to while we were trying to ransom hostages with arms 
and telling the world wed never deal with terrorists george bush 
sat in the oval office absolutely mute so far as we know 
and our question of george bush is why didnt he pound the 
table like george shultz and cap weinberger who called it a 
cockamamie idea 
there are 240 million people in the united states and only five 
or six people thought selling arms to the ayatollah was a good 
idea and they all just happened to be in the white house at the 
same time 
george bush said thursday in boston that he would be tough on 
crime but he couldnt even hear the shredders in the basement of 
the white house when they were running at white hot speed 
apparently his toughness on crime will depend on whos committing 
the crime 
and when he told us he was liberated and was now his own man 
and made his own very first unfettered decision he chose j 
danforth quayle as his running mate and that decision speaks 
volumes about his judgment 
the people of this nation know we have problems and theyre not 
afraid to face them george bush says elect me and ill give you 
more of the same more debt more tax relief for the rich less 
income for working people 
michael dukakis says he believes that men and women should be 
allowed the dignity of a decent job an affordable home in which to 
raise their families a clean environment oceans free of 
unspeakable trash an educational system that will get us out of 
last place in international competition health care for the 
havenots an end to the nuclear arms race and the beginning of a 
strong national defense in fact not one just where the only 
criterion is how much money we spend on it not one where we buy 
weapons whether we need them or not or whether they work or not 
never in our history has this nation needed so much leadership 
and received so little 
we can deal with every one of our problems i agree with barry 
goldwater when he says george bush ought to talk about the issues 
no problem has ever been solved by ignoring it and no nation has 
ever achieved greatness by electing those who would divide us on 
the issue of who loves america more and well never make it by 
continuing to elect those who break their promises 
so we democrats plead with you america dont read their lips 
look at their record
