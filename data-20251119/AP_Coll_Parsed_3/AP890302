the united nations agreed to resume food shipments 
to somalia after the government pledged to stop arming refugees and 
resettle them away from areas affected by civil war a un official 
said wednesday 
somalia has been accused of arming refugees from neighboring 
ethiopia to fight rebels of the somali national movement in the 
north somalia says ethiopias marxist government is aiding the 
rebels 
the accord announced wednesday paved the way for un food 
shipments via the somalian port of berbera to resume this week after 
about a twoweek suspension said arthur e dewey a un deputy 
high commissioner for refugees 
the un agency plans to have observers in a new resettlement 
camp to guard against rearming of refugees dewey told a news 
conference after completing negotiations with somali officials last 
week 
the pact sets a threemonth deadline for continued un food 
shipments for six camps before all refugees there must be disarmed 
and relocated to safe areas dewey said 
us officials said last month that reports of widespread human 
rights violations in somalia prompted a cutoff of us military aid 
last summer and that 55 million in economic assistance is being 
withheld 
dewey said the somali government has pledged its best efforts 
to stop the flow of weapons to refugees but he warned that 
detection of arms could trigger a un aid cutoff in the future 
the un agency expects the resettlement of 7000080000 
refugees mostly ethiopians to take six weeks once detailed plans 
are set later this week he said 
following government wishes the most likely resettlement site 
will be near the city of boroma near the ethiopian border and about 
90 miles northwest of the current camps along the road from berbera 
to hargeisa inland he said 
many ethiopians began fleeing into neighboring somalia in the 
early 1980s following a border dispute between the two countries and 
more arrived during the 198485 drought in ethiopia

a federal appeals court on wednesday upheld a 
lower court ruling that vacated the 1977 convictions of former 
maryland gov marvin mandel and five others in a political 
corruption case 
the tie vote by the full 4th circuit court of appeals in 
richmond va could be the final stop for a political scandal that 
turned into a prolonged legal battle for the exgovernor as he 
sought vindication from charges that he misused his powers to help 
his associates horse racing business 
however us attorney for maryland breckinridge willcox said he 
would ask the justice department to authorize an appeal to the us 
supreme court 
it encourages me to think that theres enough uncertainty over 
this very issue that it needs supreme court review willcox said 
the appeals court voted 55 on a prosecution request to rehear 
an appeal that had been denied by a threejudge panel of the court 
in december willcox said a tie vote means rejection of the request 
we are gratified that after more than a decade the mandel case 
now appears to be over mandels baltimore attorney arnold 
weiner said in a statement 
in 1975 while he was still governor mandel was charged with 
helping five men obtain extra racing days for marlboro race track 
he also was accused of accepting 350000 in gifts and financial 
help in a divorce settlement 
indicted on the mail fraud charges halfway through his second 
fouryear term mandel remained in office until the day he was 
sentenced 
he won a reversal on appeal allowing him to regain the 
governors office for the last days of his term which expired in 
1979 but another appeals court reinstated the conviction forcing 
mandel to serve 14 months at a federal prison camp 
in november 1987 us district judge frederic smalkin set aside 
the mail fraud convictions on grounds that mandels trial jury was 
improperly allowed to consider a theory of mail fraud law that has 
since been overturned by the us supreme court 
the supreme court ruled in june 1987 that the federal mail fraud 
statutes cannot be used to prosecute public officials for defrauding 
citizens of their intangible rights to honest government 
in december three judges of the appeals court agreed with 
smalkin

south carolina on wednesday barred 
hazardous waste from 32 states and puerto rico and put extra 
inspectors at the states only commercially operated landfill to 
turn away trucks from the banned states 
the federal environmental protection agency expressed concern 
about the ban and called for an equitable solution two of the 
banned states florida and north carolina began efforts to regain 
access to south carolinas single privately owned landfill 
south carolinas department of health and environmental control 
announced tuesday that only 17 other states and the district of 
columbia would be allowed to continue disposing hazardous waste in 
the state beginning wednesday 
the ban was the result of a jan 18 executive order by gov 
carroll campbell who said south carolina would stop taking 
hazardous waste from any state that prohibits hazardous waste 
dumping within its own borders 
campbell said the ban was meant to encourage other states to 
locate disposal sites within their own borders rather than relying 
on south carolina 
ten extra inspectors stood ready wednesday at the gsx services 
landfill on the shore of lake marion about 40 miles southeast of 
the state capital of columbia but all loads that arrived on the 
first day of the ban were from approved states according to health 
department spokesman bill culler 
it looks like the word got around and there havent been a 
whole lot of problems culler said 
the site accepts 135000 tons of hazardous waste annually 
including solvents acids and other chemical garbage about 70 
percent of the waste comes from out of state about 45 percent from 
the banned states 
the gsx site is one of only two commercial hazardous waste 
landfills in the southeast the other is in emelle ala 
south carolina officials said they would consider dropping states 
from the banned list if the states prove theyre willing to dump 
hazardous waste on their own soil 
officials from both florida and north carolina the two largest 
contributors to south carolinas dump said they hoped to take that 
pledge 
the head of floridas department of environmental regulation 
dale twachtmann has written south carolina officials asking them to 
reconsider the decision according to raoul clarke an administrator 
with the florida agency 
north carolina gov jim martin said legislation has been proposed 
to repeal north carolinas ban on a hazardous waste landfill he 
added that he understood campbells irritation with other states 
inaction on hazardous waste 
the federal epas southeastern administrator greer tidwell 
issued a statement saying the south carolina ban underscores the 
need for the states to work towards an equitable solution of the 
problem

president george vassiliou of cyprus said thursday 
that the greek majority in his country was willing to make 
substantial concessions to the islands turkish minority 
vassiliou met with prime minister margaret thatcher to discuss 
his talks with turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash 
vassiliou said the greek cypriot majority is willing to make 
very extensive concessions to unify the island 
in a lecture to the royal institute of international affairs he 
said the partition of a small island such as cyprus made no sense 
it is not a solution economically 
vassiliou and denktash will hold an intensive series of meetings 
between march 6 and march 28 in an attempt to find a formula to 
reunify the island into a twostate federation 
the unmediated talks so far have deadlocked on several issues 
including withdrawal of about 30000 turkish troops stationed in 
denktashs breakaway turkish republic of northern cyprus and the 
authority of the two states in the federation 
vassiliou said greek cypriots were willing and ready to make 
very extensive concessions in the field of powersharing with the 
turkish cypriot community 
the idea of demilitarization envisages the total withdrawal of 
all noncypriot forces from the republic of cyprus and the 
disbanding of all cypriot armed forces he said 
a united and stable cyprus under a federal constitution would 
pose much less of a threat to turkey than a divided embittered and 
hostile cyprus he said 
the island was unofficially partitioned in 1974 when the turkish 
army invaded after a greekinspired coup intended to unite the 
island with greece

faced with a public 
outcry west germany is about to tighten up its liberal asylum law 
that has attracted refugees from as near as czechoslovakia and as 
far away as sri lanka 
more than 27600 asylumseekers arrived last year at the 
schwalbach camp just outside frankfurt roughly one quarter of the 
nationwide total 
and they are still coming at a record pace despite the 
controversy surrounding them and charges that many come not in 
search of freedom from political persecution but for their own 
economic betterment 
germany is good and maybe they will grant me political 
asylum said a 28yearold nigerian standing in the crowded halls 
of the tidy modern camp here 
he explained that fighting between christians and moslems in his 
country led him to come 
a 21yearold tamil said indian troops sent to his native sri 
lanka prompted his departure 
marem taraky a 40yearold teacher from kabul in afghanistan 
said she will stay out of her country until peace returns 
most of the asylumseekers arriving at the frankfurt airport are 
driven by bus to the camp which is at the end of a mudcovered 
road but some usually people who arrived with tourist visas take 
the subway in frankfurt to the end of the line and walk the rest of 
the way 
west german officials say some people cross on foot over west 
germanys southern borders 
some poles come here directly with their cars and say here i 
am said volker moeser the camp director 
so far this year the largest number of refugees arriving at the 
staterun schwalbach camp have come from turkey followed in order 
by sri lanka poland iran afghanistan india ghana yugoslavia 
somalia and lebanon 
moeser said some of the refugees mainly the ones who speak some 
english or german are aware of the heated political debate 
surrounding the political asylum issue 
asylumseekers throughout the country occasionally are the 
targets of violence 
on feb 14 unknown assailants firebombed a home for 
asylumseekers in the northern bavarian town of memmelsdorf damage 
was minor and none of the 15 poles and hungarians inside were 
injured 
a similar attack took place at a home for asylumseekers in 
nearby bamberg the following day about the same time as that 
attack five socalled skinheads picked a fight with an indian 
asylumseeker in the hesse state town of schluechtern injuring the 
refugee and two skinheads 
while violence still is limited general dissatisfaction among 
germans with the number of asylumseekers continues to grow after 
the number hit 103076 last year 
that was reflected by the surprisingly strong showing by the 
rightwing extremist republican party in west berlin elections in 
january the party ran on a platform calling for expulsion of 
asylumseekers as well as foreign workers whom west germany 
welcomed in the early years of its postwar economic boom 
the rising negative sentiment has led chancellor helmut kohls 
christian democratic union cdu to set up a committee to work out 
measures for the prevention of massive abuse of the asylum laws 
under the current system anyone who claims that he or she faces 
persecution back home generally is entitled to seek asylum along 
with immediate family members 
kohl says his coalition government is most interested in 
excluding economic asylum seekers people who are mainly 
interested in escaping poverty back home other reported abuses 
include cases of east europeans who come in search of asylum but 
occasionally go back home for visits 
the chancellor promised quick action but did not outline any 
timetable 
were looking into steps that can be taken without a change in 
the constitution cdu member of parliament michael maiworm told 
reporters in bonn 
the chairman of the group is johannes gerster a christian 
democratic member of parliament who already has called for hearings 
on asylum requests within 48 hours of arrival in west germany a 
shortening of the appeals process is also under review 
the free democrats the junior partner in kohls coalition have 
already signalled a willingness to tighten up the political asylum 
procedures in this country of 613 million people 
while generally less than 10 percent of the asylumseekers are 
granted such status lengthy legal proceedings and other policies 
often allow the refugees to stay in west germany almost 
indefinitely that includes a ban on sending people back to regions 
wracked by war or other widespread violence 
as a general rule the asylumseekers are barred from working in 
west germany for either one year or five years depending on their 
status that means they live at government expense often lodged in 
hotels or guest houses 
the bild am sonntag newspaper published an article recently 
claiming that asylumseekers will cost west germany 28 billion 
this year

liu guangyong squatted next to her 
possessions outside the main canton railway station one of the 25 
million peasants who have descended on this prosperous region in 
search of good jobs at good wages 
she and a group of 16 people from her village in central sichuan 
province arrived monday in this capital of guangdong province after 
riding the rails for three days and three nights by the following 
day however it was clear they could not get the garment factory 
jobs they thought were available 
we got no jobs so we just slept on the road outside the 
factory liu a mother of two said as she guarded a meager pile 
of clothing and toiletries 
her group was among legions of disappointed job seekers who 
returned to the train station tuesday to try to obtain tickets to go 
back to their villages 
why dont they add more trains to take us home the woman 
asked 
peasants from the interior of china have long flocked to coastal 
guangdong province to work the textile toy and other factories set 
up largely with capital from the neighboring british colony of hong 
kong 90 miles to the southeast of canton 
chinas official statistics bureau said the average annual wage 
in guangdong last year was 586 per worker or about double the 
national average 
but the crush in february in which an army of itinerant workers 
roughly equal to the population of the city of atlanta descended on 
the province clearly surprised authorities who said guangdong did 
not have work for so many people 
guangdong officials claimed the onslaught estimated by official 
media at 25 million people occurred when migrant laborers who 
briefly returned home for the chinese lunar new year that began feb 
6 and convinced fellow villagers they could strike it rich in the 
province 
the official xinhua news agency said public security transport 
and hygiene in guangdong were strained by the influx crime was up 
and begging was expected to rise it said 
the guangdong government ordered factories not to hire new 
employees from other provinces issued an urgent appeal to the rest 
of china to prevent people from coming and threatened to kick out 
the itinerants who did not leave on their own as of tuesday 20000 
people reportedly were leaving the province daily and guangdong 
officials said the situation was improving 
ma shenwu a 38yearold peasant who arrived with five friends 
from hunan a province on guangdongs eastern border was back at 
the canton station tuesday after failing to find a job in four towns 
we have to borrow money to go home he said 
liu qian 18 also was at the station trying to return to her 
village in neighboring hunan province after she failed to get a job 
at an electronics factory in shenzhen a special economic zone next 
to hong kong 
she said the factory boss refused to employ her and five friends 
she had brought from home because they did not have the proper 
permits 
when i was in hunan the government office was off for the 
festival so i could not renew my permit she said 
rural peasants were not the only ones who rushed to guangdong 
sitting next to a group of peasants at the railway station were 
several fashionably clothed women from shanghai wearing makeup and 
earrings 
we were deceived they told us we could earn 700 yuan 188 a 
month in shenzhen but we found it was less than 300 81 and 16 
hours work a day we were cheated one of them said 
we worked for two weeks and decided to leave another added 
unlike the jobseekers from the countryside the shanghai women 
kept smiling as they told their story because they had jobs waiting 
for them in a clothing factory back home 
when we left shanghai our boss asked us not to leave and 
said he would welcome us back we can even charge this trip to him 
so we see this trip as a holiday the first girl said 
chinas migrant labor force estimated at 20 million is a 
byproduct of the nations easing of travel restrictions and of 
marketoriented reforms which have encouraged labor mobility 
the influx of peasants to the cities has helped solve problems of 
surplus labor in the farming areas and provided workers for 
factories and the booming construction industry 
last fall the government announced a cutback on investment 
credit and a halt to thousands of construction projects to reduce 
inflation and cool the overheated economy

inside the house where ferdinand marcos 
grew up an open casket containing the body of his mother is still 
displayed nearly a year after her death 
a slip of paper resting on the glass that covers her face marks 
the number of days since her death 
although the paper does not mention president corazon aquino its 
message is clear the body of josefa edralinmarcos would have been 
buried long ago if the president had allowed marcos to return from 
exile 
but mrs aquino citing national security has refused to permit 
the ailing 71yearold marcos to return from hawaii where he fled 
after being ousted as president in a popularmilitary uprising three 
years ago 
and so the house of marcos has become more a mausoleum than a 
museum 
gone are the large crowds that turned out to view dona josefa 
when the body was brought last year from manila to this town in 
ilocos norte province 240 miles north of the capital 
national newspapers in manila as well as most of the countrys 58 
million people have all but forgotten the endless wake for dona 
josefa except for the occasional crude joke in the capital about 
marcos mummy 
but a curious mix of tourists relatives marcos loyalists and 
religious fanatics still gather daily to view the body and a display 
of marcos furnishings newspaper clippings and war medals 
they offer prayers not only for the soul of the former school 
teacher but for the return of marcos from exile 
although mrs edralinmarcos died may 4 in manila at age 95 her 
family postponed burial indefinitely in the hope that mrs aquino 
would relent and allow marcos to return home for the funeral 
relatives say a mortician visits the museum every two months to 
inject mrs edralinmarcos with embalming fluid the body is dressed 
in a white embroidered gown that covers all but her face which is 
heavily made up 
masses were said in several churches in the area on feb 15 mrs 
edralinmarcos 96th birthday residents said 
she looks so fresh said marcos niece cynthia pobletechan 
as she gazed at her grandmothers body were just waiting for 
their marcos word when to bury her in the family plot at the 
eastern edge of this town 
banners with slogans such as the whole filipino nation is 
condoling hang on the walls of the family home along with 
pictures of marcos his wife imelda and other mementos of his life 
three times a day a small group of marcos supporters gathers 
around the bier to pray the rosary 
residents have been joined recently by members of a religious 
sect the alphaomega who believe that the return of marcos is 
part of a divine plan for the philippines cult members dressed in 
red and blue shirts printed with the words alphaomega keep an 
almost daily watch by the bier 
when mrs pobletechan appeared during a recent wake cult 
members knelt before her and kissed her hand reverently 
teresita maglahus a spokeswoman for the group said the cultists 
followed mrs edralinmarcos body to batac after their leader 
known only as mama rose received a vision from god 
lola mrs edralinmarcos needs prayers for her soul miss 
maglahus said nothing can stop god and the return of marcos if 
people only knew who marcos is they would kneel down in front of 
him 
in a town where marcos is still revered officials say the wake 
could go on indefinitely until the former president himself gives 
the word for burial 
personally i want her to be buried so her soul can rest 
said vice mayor rodolfo yadao a member of marcos new society 
movement party 
meanwhile he said the number of visitors to the town and its 
chief attraction the marcos museum has doubled since the body was 
brought here

weeks after the sixth body was discovered but no more have been 
found 
bristol county district attorney ronald pina said as many as four 
other missing females may also be victims 
like the other five victims mcconnell who had a drug record 
had ties to new bedfords seedy weld square district an area known 
for the availability of drugs and prostitutes pina said

said pina 
deborah mcconnell knew at least one of the other murder victims 
nancy paiva of new bedford and also may have known two others 
pina said 
forensics expert dr douglas uebelaker of the smithsonian 
institution said weeks ago before mcconnell had been positively 
identified that the woman was killed sometime in march 1988 
identifying the body was delayed because no one reported 
mcconnell missing last year and investigators could not find her 
dental records 
late last year when the investigation was gaining wide 
publicity mcconnells father came forward and said he had not seen 
her in months pina said eventually xray records enabled 
uebelaker to identify the woman 
pina said he plans to go before a grand jury for the first of two 
days of testimony on thursday and he said he was planning to use 
the grand jury as an investigative tool and expected no indictments 
pina has said his list of suspects remains at three or four and 
that not all of the suspects are from massachusetts

a controversial exhibit using an american flag 
spread on the floor at the school of the art institute will go back 
on display but not for public viewing officials said wednesday 
the display will be only for students faculty and staff of the 
museum school but the move drew immediate protest from veterans 
groups which filed a lawsuit late wednesday to remove the flag 
what were objecting to of course is that it is the 
american flag and the flag is being disgraced walked on said 
john mahoney of the american legion 
this is totally unacceptable to the veterans groups said 
joseph a morris general counsel for the midamerica legal 
foundation which represents the veterans of foreign wars disabled 
american veterans and the military order of the purple heart among 
others 
the work by student scott tyler titled what is the proper way 
to display a us flag last week sparked demonstrations by angry 
veterans and threats of violence countered by student concerns 
about freedom of expression 
school officials canceled weekend classes and closed the gallery 
where tylers work is displayed after meetings with students 
faculty and veterans representatives officials said the gallery 
would reopen thursday for inhouse viewing only and under 
additional security 
the school will continue to ensure that the first amendment 
rights and the safety of its students are protected 
to fulfill its responsibility to viewers the school will post 
a sign advising persons of the intent of the police and prosecutors 
offices should a viewer choose to step on the flag officials said 
in a written statement 
police have determined it is legal to display the work but says 
trampling or otherwise desecrating the flag is a felony the school 
has said previously 
in the work a flag is spread on the floor in front of a 
photomontage of flagdraped coffins south koreans burning the us 
flag and other scenes visitors are invited to comment in a ledger 
on a shelf in front of the exhibit 
the veterans complain that in doing so most will step on the 
flag 
it is not necessary for the viewer to walk on the flag to write 
in the book said the schools statement wednesday there is 
sufficient room to stand on either side of the flag for those 
viewers who choose to write comments in the book 
its the second time in a year that an exhibit at the school has 
stirred controversy black aldermen stormed its halls last year to 
take down a portrait of the late harold washington the citys first 
black mayor who was depicted by a student wearing frilly womens 
underwear

army commander gen michel aoun is 
whittling down the power of his main rival in a fight for control of 
lebanons christian enclave and has opened the door a crack for a 
settlement with moslems to end 14 years of civil war 
aoun heads the countrys christian government which is vying for 
legitimacy with a rival moslem cabinet 
last month he scored a military victory over samir geagea 
leader of the rightwing lebanese forces militia in the fiercest 
street battles between christian factions in four years 
but aoun has not completely crushed the messianic geagea a 
maronite catholic like himself and christian political leaders 
expect more bloodshed before the power struggle is finally resolved 
you cant have two roosters in one yard one former christian 
cabinet minister warned there may have to be more fighting 
although geageas forces remain largely intact aoun has forced 
him out of his strongholds in east beirut opening up the 
possibility of reuniting the divided capital for the first time 
since the civil war erupted in april 1975 
the stumpy 53yearold general has driven the lebanese forces 
the christians main militia out of the socalled 5th basin in 
beirut port 
that robbed the militia of one of its main sources of revenue and 
allowed the port to be reopened after a fiveyear closure enhancing 
hopes of reuniting the battlescarred capital 
the port straddles the citys green line which divides christian 
east beirut from moslem west beirut 
by taking over control of the midcity museum crossing one of 
the main green line gateways and other customs posts on the borders 
of the christian sector controlled by the dominant maronite sect 
aoun has stripped geagea of an estimated 400000 a day in revenue 
he also has ordered that no taxes be paid to the lebanese forces 
in areas under army control cutting geageas income by another 30 
percent 
aouns military success has made him the most likely next 
candidate to succeed amin gemayel as president gemayels term 
expired sept 22 with no successor elected because the lebanese 
forces opposed syrianbacked candidates 
the lebanese forces however remain largely intact because aoun 
reined in his troops after only two days of fighting in response to 
appeals by maronite religious leaders 
both sides are regrouping and fortifying their positions 
he should have gone all the way said a moslem government 
official who sympathizes with aoun speaking on condition of 
anonymity geageas been left with a chance to hit back and hell 
be merciless if he does 
an aoun aide said the ceasefire was a risk the general had to 
take hes perfectly aware of the consequences he knows hell 
either be the next president or dead 
electing aoun would make possible an accomodation with syria 
the main power broker in lebanon and its lebanese moslem and 
leftist allies and avert the threatened formalization of partition 
into sectarian cantons 
aoun has taken a more moderate stand toward the syrians since he 
attended arab league talks in tunis aimed at defusing the political 
crisis and has made it clear he is prepared to take syrian security 
interests into account if elected president 
the syrians have signalled theyre ready to deal with him and 
their staterun press has openly supported him 
removing the fiercely antisyrian antimoslem geagea has long 
been a key demand of syria and its lebanese allies who charge the 
militia commander has close ties with israel 
geagea says the 40000 syrian troops in lebanon under a 1976 arab 
league peacekeeping mandate are an occupation force he demands 
their unconditional withdrawal as a precondition for a 
christianmoslem settlement based on a loose federal system 
aoun wants geagea out of east beirut and isolated north of the 
city so the capital can be reunited and parliament convened to elect 
him president on a reunification platform 
for their part the syrians are understood to be willing to 
withdraw their forces from west beirut to the hills overlooking the 
city and turn over security to moslem units of the lebanese army 
under maj gen sami khatib 
the syrian scenario for a lebanese settlement hinges largely on 
eliminating the extremists on both sides of the sectarian divide to 
give more moderate elements a chance to work out an agreement 
through their main surrogates the shiite moslem amal militia 
the syrians have weakened the the iranianbacked shiite hezbollah 
or party of god which seeks to create an islamic republic in 
lebanon 
however like geageas fighters hezbollah has not been totally 
crushed 
no one in lebanon believes that an end to lebanons agony in 
which some 150000 people have been killed is just around the 
corner given the deeprooted divisions but with arab pressure 
growing for a settlement there may at last be a light albeit 
flickering and faint at the end of the tunnel

treasury secretary nicholas f brady is blaming 
newspaper headlines and television reports for causing billions of 
dollars in withdrawals at savings and loan associations so far this 
year 
federal savings and loan regulators on wednesday revealed that 
depositors withdrew at least 1 billion last month after publication 
of a list of institutions targeted for government takeover 
brady appearing before the senate budget committee said its 
our conviction that the outflow is due to the stories on the nightly 
news and the black headlines on the front of the business pages or 
page 1 almost every day for the past two months 
he said sampls have been forced to increase interest rates on 
savings by an average of threefourths of a percentage point to hold 
deposits following the increase in public attention to the 
industrys problems he predicted that the rates would drop once 
president bushs plan to bail out the industry is approved and 
public confidence is restored 
we feel growth in deposits will be strong in the future he 
said 
m danny wall chairman of the federal home loan bank board said 
the nations 2950 sampls suffered net withdrawals of 4 billion to 5 
billion in february 1 billion to 2 billion of it at the 220 
institutions earmarked for takeover by the federal deposit insurance 
corp 
wall in a separate appearance before the senate banking 
committee said the bulk of the withdrawals were a normal response 
to rising interest rates other investments offering a better 
return such as money market mutual funds lure bank and sampl 
customers away he said 
also shaky and rescued sampls under orders from regulators to 
scale back their operations represented another substantial 
portion he said 
roger martin another member of the bank board told reporters 
that withdrawals throughout the thrift industry totaled 7 billion 
in january 
that represents a continuation of the socalled silent run 
that began gathering steam with a 7 billion outflow in november and 
a record withdrawal of 81 billion in december 
the withdrawals add up to 26 billion to 27 billion over the 
four months all sampl deposits at the end of 1988 totaled 970 
billion 
in january public attention to the industrys problem soared 
after the administration revealed it was considering a controversial 
proposal since dropped to charge depositors a fee the industrys 
problems received another dose of publicity in early february when 
the president proposed his rescue plan 
the fdic which regulates commercial banks has been assuming 
control of the worstoff savings institutions as a preliminary step 
before enactment of bushs plan 
so far the agency has taken over only 36 of the targeted 
institutions in a legal arrangement called a conservatorship the 
agency plans to have about half of the 220 under control by the end 
of next week and the rest by the end of the month 
the affected institutions while still privately owned are 
controlled by the government they remain open and all accounts 
continue to be protected up to the 100000 insurance limit 
martin said the high withdrawal rate at the 220 insolvent 
institutions has since stabilized 
we had a temporary aberration but that has subsided 
tremendously he said i just think it was something that hit 
the press the word conservatorship i think people thought about 
it in terms of bankruptcy but thats all stopped 
last week the bank board and the federal reserve board announced 
a joint lending agreement with the treasury to pump cash if 
necessary into any sampl that needed it wall said however that he 
expected little use of the agreement 
you put a mechanism like that into place and the basic purpose 
is you dont have to use it wall said its there everybody 
knows its there they have the confidence that thats the case so 
as to make no call on it

congressional budget writers say they are 
edging closer to negotiations with the bush administration even as 
the house appropriations committee warns it is unhappy with the 
presidents 1990 spending plan 
the democratic chairmen of the two congressional budget 
committees and the topranking republicans emerged from a session 
with administration budget director richard darman to say their 
series of informational meetings together seems to be nearing an end 
house budget chairman leon panetta dcalif and rep bill 
frenzel of minnesota the panels ranking republican said talks 
might be held next week between darman and the four top members of 
the budget panels about how negotiations among administration 
officials and congressional leaders might proceed 
we might sit down without staff and talk about where to go 
frenzel said 
panetta said the sessions would examine whether there are 
approaches congress and the white house could agree to on deficit 
reduction 
panetta said that meanwhile in a twotrack approach his 
committee probably will begin writing a budget resolution in 
midmarch with a goal of finishing its work by april 1 
darman and congressional budget writers have already met several 
times recently during these sessions congressional leaders have 
tried to learn more details about bushs budget plan which they say 
is vague 
the administration has been seeking highlevel talks on its 116 
trillion fiscal 1990 spending plan many democrats have been leery 
however arguing that it would be a better strategy for democrats to 
write their own plan or wait until bush spells out where he would 
make spending cuts necessary to meet his overall budget goals 
meanwhile democrats and republican on the appropriations panel 
in a report to the house budget committee said bushs 116 
trillion fiscal blueprint does not deal adequately with essential 
national needs and said they will make changes in his spending mix 
the committee will adjust priorities as it deems necessary to 
provide for essential national needs panel members wrote in a 
required annual report 
republicans on the committee submitted a statement saying they 
favored reducing the deficit by raising new revenues and by saving 
money in socalled mandatory programs these programs are usually 
benefits for which people automatically qualify such as medicare 
assistance for the elderly and handicapped 
clearly the first step is to see if we can find enough 
mandatory program savings and new resources to pay for any new 
initiatives said the gop statement submitted by the panels 
ranking republican rep silvio conte rmass and supported by at 
least 21 of the 22 gop members 
the best way to seek agreement on this fundamental issue is to 
convene a leadership group to negotiate the republicans said 
asked if he was suggesting new revenues and mandatory spending 
cuts beyond those recommended by bush in his budget conte said 
that has to be considered 
the views of the appropriations committees members though 
important are not surprising because the panel oversees all 
spending programs except for the mandatory ones 
the grammrudman law requires a deficit next year of no more than 
100 billion every dollar collected in taxes or saved by reducing 
mandatory programs is another dollar the appropriations committee 
can spend on the programs it controls 
the committee expressed doubt over whether congress will grant 
the 303 billion in military spending or the 147 billion for 
foreign affairs that bush seeks 
the committee also said it believes bush has sought insufficient 
spending for housing environmental protection and medical care for 
veterans

under lenins dour gaze from a giant portrait 
soviet officials uncorked their new export supervodka and hustled 
american guests like bornagain capitalists with grins backslaps 
and heaping bowls of caviar 
glasnost was in full flower wednesday night at the soviet 
embassy and warm feelings of openness were stoked by frequent 
gulps of stolichnaya cristall the ultrapremium russian vodka that 
will appear on liquor store shelves in 10 american cities this week 
you might ask what is the difference between stolichnaya and 
stolichnaya cristall soviet ambassador yuri v dubinin smilingly 
told the happy throng i suspect the effect is just the same but 
stolichnaya cristall is better for your health 
if dubinin and his marketing comrades get their way stolichnaya 
cristall will be good for the health of the soviet economy which 
suffers from a shortage of hard western currencies 
the commerce department says united states imported a record 17 
billion in soviet goods last year compared with us exports of 
nearly 28 billion to the soviet union the us export figure 
representing largely grain was up 87 percent from the previous year 
but below the record 36 billion in 1979 before the soviet invasion 
of afghanistan prompted a us embargo 
stolichnaya cristall like the older stolichnaya brand is bought 
by pepsico inc for resale in the united states under a 1972 
agreement that allows the soviets to produce pepsi cola at 21 
bottling plants under a newly negotiated deal 26 additional pepsi 
cola plants will be opened within the next few years 
its an oldfashioned barter deal said pepsico chairman 
donald m kendall who received the first bottle of stolichnaya 
cristall from dubinin at the embassy reception 
stolichnaya cristall is named for the cristall distillery in 
moscow one of the two plants that produces the prestige export 
vodka the latest version developed in 1982 is made from the 
finest winter wheat and the purest spring waters from the moscow 
region said suren s santurian senior engineer of amtorg trading 
corp the soviet governments export marketing agency 
drawn from the finest 5 percent of the alcohol that trickles 
through three sets of activated charcoal filters stolichnaya 
cristall is like taking the cream off the top of the milk 
kendall said 
retail us prices will be ultrapremium as well a bottle of 
stolichnaya cristall will sell for 18 to 20 retail that will be 
about 5 more than regular stolichnaya which is billed as the 
only authentic russian vodka available in the united states 
the new vodka served in brimming shot glasses from silver trays 
by waiters in black ties was a hit among the several hundred 
american representatives of the wine and spirits trade members of 
congress and journalists who attended the reception 
the guests also feasted on iced bowls of petrossian caviar 
norwegian smoked salmon grilled beef filets and chicken breasts 
lime bavarian cream charlotte and black russian tea 
one reporter observed after downing a shot glass of cristall 
its real smooth compared to the cheap rotgut i buy its like a 
sipping whiskey theres no burn it just goes straight down 
stolichnaya is extremely difficult to obtain in the soviet union 
where it is reserved for export foreigners and the soviet elite 
who have access to special consumer goods stores in moscow

the state departments annual report on 
international drug trafficking is likely to spark controversy in 
congress over its praise for mexico which ranks as the single 
largest source for heroin entering the united states 
in a letter accompanying the report secretary of state james a 
baker iii acknowledged on wednesday that the worldwide battle 
against narcotics is clearly not being won and might even be 
slipping backwards 
the report serves as president bushs annual update for congress 
on global drug trafficking 
in contrast to last years report which said corruption in the 
mexican government was endemic this years lauded usmexican 
cooperation and points to increased drug seizures and arrests it 
also takes note of a new agreement on fighting drug trafficking 
last year the senate voted 6327 to punish mexico for its lack 
of cooperation in the battle against drugs but the attempt was 
killed in the house this year congress has 45 days to decide 
whether it agrees with the presidents findings 
the report lists 17 countries or territories as major narcotics 
producers or transit points yet finds that their governments may 
receive us assistance to continue the effort against illicit drugs 
bush recommended that burma and laos be added to the list of 
nations ineligible for us aid because of their support for drug 
trafficking but the two nations dont receive any us aid anyway 
nor do the other nations on the list afghanistan iran syria 
and panama but the action does permit the government to impose 
tariffs or tighten custom rules against certain imports 
some of the reports most striking language came in the dim view 
taken by baker on the international drug fight 
both here and abroad the international war on narcotics is 
clearly not being won in fact in some areas we appear to be 
slipping backwards baker said 
ann wrobleski assistant secretary of state for international 
narcotics matters said bakers assessment was based on worldwide 
increases in marijuana opium and coca production as well as a 
worldwide increase in drug abuse 
these twin increases fuel an increase in power of drug 
trafficking cartels and that worries us said ms wrobleski 
baker noted that of the 17 countries found to be cooperating with 
the united states six of them can and must do more in the future 
to end the drug trade 
they included 
the bahamas which was praised for a combined law enforcement 
operation with the united states but was cited for possible 
government corruption and urged to make stronger unilateral 
efforts to curb drug trafficking and consumption 
bolivia which was lauded for a good effort with its coca 
eradication program but the report said more must be done 
colombia which was praised for strong action against 
cocaine refining and resistance to violent drug traffickers but the 
report noted that the countrys judiciary remains intimidated by 
drug traffickers 
mexico which was cited for president carlos salinas strong 
public stance against drugs as well as the efforts of his new 
deputy attorney generals office but corruption was seen as a 
continuing problem and the nation remains the united states top 
source for heroin and its no 2 source for marijuana 
paraguay which was praised for a stronger commitment in 
1988 but was still termed a significant drug transit point and 
money laundering center former gen alfredo stroessner was ousted 
by a military coup in february although reports have surfaced that 
the new president andres rodriguez has links to the 
drugtrafficking industry the report says the department does not 
yet know what type of actions will be taken by his government 
peru which was lauded for some real progress in antidrug 
programs but was urged to adopt an even stronger crop control 
effort in the coming year 
one country lebanon was certified for us aid under a special 
waiver because the major drugproducing area of the country is 
occupied by the syrian military 
the other nations that were certified included belize brazil 
ecuador hong kong india jamaica malaysia morocco nigeria 
pakistan and thailand

budget cuts have forced the national 
weather service to eliminate a forecasting unit widely used by the 
news media to supply public information the director said 
the public service unit of the national severe storms forecast 
center will be eliminated by sept 30 as part of systemwide cuts 
necessitated by a budget crunch fred ostby the centers director 
said wednesday 
one of the main duties of the fivemember unit is writing four 
daily summaries of the nations weather conditions it also answers 
queries from reporters about weather developments and provides the 
nations highest and lowest temperatures of the day and information 
on any record temperatures for the date 
it looks like were going to have to bite the bullet here 
ourselves ostby said fortunately the center for a long time 
has been relatively immune from this the part of our service that 
deals with lives and property will stay intact 
the severe storms forecast center has been based in kansas city 
since 1954 it has a staff of about 70 people whose prime mission is 
to forecast severe weather developments and issue watches and 
warnings 
ostby said that as now envisioned the center would retain two of 
the five jobs now assigned to the public service unit but the 
duties of the remaining positions would be expanded 
the number of daily national weather summaries will be trimmed 
from four to two but no one will be available to take queries from 
news reporters provide the nations highest and lowest readings or 
any record temperatures he said

health and human services secretary louis 
sullivan soon will have to come up with answers on some of the most 
difficult issues facing his department including fetal tissue 
research and planned medicare spending cuts 
sullivan goes into the job of secretary of a department that 
spends a third of the federal budget with the confidence of the 
senate which approved his nomination 981 on wednesday 
i think hes well equipped to meet these challenges sen 
lloyd bentsen dtexas said during debate on the nomination 
sullivan who stepped down as president of the morehouse school 
of medicine in atlanta to take the hhs job has avoided taking 
positions on some of the hot issues he faces and one of those cost 
him a vote in the senate 
sen jesse helms rnc cast the lone vote against the 
55yearold atlanta doctor as a matter of conscience because 
sullivan had declined to support the antiabortion position against 
use of federal funds to back medical research using aborted fetuses 
at his confirmation hearing last week before the senate finance 
committee sullivan said he would not do anything to encourage 
abortion in order to get fetal tissue for research however he 
said he wanted to review an advisory committees recommendations 
before stating a final position on what conditions if any such 
research could be allowed 
the advisory committee concluded that research on tissue from 
intentionally aborted fetuses now under a moratorium at the 
national institutes of health be resumed under guidelines that 
assure women would not be encouraged to have abortions to produce 
the tissue 
abortionrelated questions have been the most controversial for 
sullivan indeed the doctors introduction to the washington 
political scene was rocky because of his comments in a newspaper 
interview favoring individual choice on abortion he later told sen 
bob packwood rore he favored retaining the supreme court 
decision that legalized abortion 
but at two committee hearings before his confirmation sullivan 
declared that he like the president opposes abortion except in 
cases of rape incest and danger to the mothers life and wants the 
court decision reversed 
packwood a prochoice advocate appeared to hold no grudge 
against sullivan either for his abortion views or his flipflop on 
the court issue and the senator said abortion has received too much 
attention already 
dr sullivan fully realizes that the major things his 
department has to do relate to medicare medicaid social security 
and the tremendous budget restraints he said 
sullivan was asked in the confirmation process about president 
bushs proposal to trim medicare spending by 5 billion in fiscal 
1990 but he has deferred on the specifics of that question saying 
he was not involved in the administrations detailed budget 
discussions 
generally sullivan has said the department must evaluate 
utilization of medical procedures funded by the federal health 
insurance program for the elderly and disabled which has grown at 
more than twice the rate of general inflation for several years 
as part of an overall strategy for cutting the increase in 
soaring medical costs in the federal budget sullivan has said that 
focusing more on preventive medicine is ultimately more humane and 
economical than merely treating illnesses 
but one senator cautioned him against optimism on this front 
saying the burgeoning federal deficit has stalled previous efforts 
to promote prevention 
youve got to spend money to save money and you cant do that 
in this system sen david durenberger rminn said during 
sullivans appearance before the finance committee last week

fbi agents who arrested accused hijacker fawaz 
younis say they advised him of his rights but did not provide him 
with a lawyer or allow him to make a telephone call 
two of the fbi agents involved in operation goldenrod in 
which younis was captured on sept 13 1987 said they read him his 
rights twice in arabic and that he waived his right to an attorney 
francis d carter younis courtappointed attorney on wednesday 
sought to show that younis did not have an adequate understanding of 
the us legal system to grasp what was happening and that some 
legal lines were blurred in an arrest that was carried out in the 
mediterranean sea with help from the navy 
four eyewitnesses have identified younis as the leader of five 
heavily armed men who stormed aboard royal jordanian airlines flight 
402 at beirut airport on june 11 1985 no one was killed in the 
incident which ended 30 hours later with the release of the 
passengers and crew 
younis 30 has pleaded innocent he is on trial under a 1984 
statute which asserts longarm jurisdiction for the united 
states in cases involving american hostages taken abroad 
in testimony wednesday fbi agents said younis told them after 
his arrest that he hijacked the plane on orders from a senior 
official of lebanons amal militia two of the agents testified 
wednesday 
younis told the fbi that the military commander of amal aql 
hamiyya gave him the orders and that they were approved by nabih 
berri the head of amal 
berri is lebanons minister of justice amal is a shiite moslem 
party 
fbi agents thomas hansen and dmitri droujinksi told the jury at 
us district court that younis recounted the hijacking in detail 
during four days aboard the navy ship uss butte after his arrest 
younis was later transferred to the aircraft carrier uss saratoga 
and flown nonstop to andrews air force base near washington 
arriving four days after his arrest the agents said 
carter sought to show that the government took inordinately long 
in transporting the suspect and interrogated him while he was 
suffering from two broken wrists inflicted during his arrest 
carter asked droujinski whether there was an attorney aboard the 
butte 
i dont think so said the agent 
did you give him a chance to use the radio to contact anybody 
at home the proverbial telephone call did you offer him that 
carter asked 
no sir replied the agent 
droujinski an arabic speaker who acted as interpreter during the 
interrogation testified that younis gave his confession orally and 
signed a written arabic language version of it making two changes 
younis corrected the spelling of one word and rephrased one 
sentence to say that berri approved rather than ordered the 
hijacking 
droujinski read the altered sentence aloud translating it into 
english 
on the day before the hijacking of the plane a highly placed 
representative of amal got in touch with me and informed me that the 
head of amal approved the hijacking of a plane from the airport of 
beirut 
carter has said that he will attempt to prove that his client was 
acting under the equivalent of military orders when he led the 
hijacking 
two other fbi agents described how they arrested younis aboard an 
80foot sailboat in international waters 13 miles off cyprus 
six members of the fbi hostage rescue team including two women 
in twopiece bathing suits were visible on board the boat as younis 
approached in a launch testified david w johnson head of the 
group 
another agent george gast testified that he and another male 
agent led younis to the back of the yacht slammed him to the deck 
told him he was under arrest and handcuffed him 
johnson said he had planned the takedown as a precaution 
i was concerned for the safety of my team testified johnson 
i didnt know whether he might be a karate expert or a judo 
expert i didnt know whether at the time of the arrest we would 
have a doublecross 
i had a bad experience with an arrest on a boat several weeks 
before in which the subject jumped overboard it caused a great 
deal of trouble he said it could get tricky and somebody 
could drown

ben johnsons coach says the sprinter who was 
stripped of olympic gold last year for steroid use had used the 
performanceenhancing drugs since 1981 because it is virtually the 
only way to stay competitive 
coach charlie francis told an inquiry wednesday that he had 
turned the canadian sprinter on to steroids because johnsons 
competitors were taking them and it was thus necessary 
he said sterioids had been worth a meter to johnson who won 
the gold medal and set a world record in the 100 meters at the seoul 
olympics only to be stripped of both the record and medal after 
testing positive for steriod use 
the 27yearold johnson has maintained that he never knowingly 
used drugs 
francis johnsons coach since 1977 told the canadian inquiry 
board that he first approached johnson about anabolic steroids and 
other performanceenhancing drugs in the summer of 1981 
he said johnson was not sure of the advantages but had during 
the fall decided he would go on 
if he wanted to compete its pretty clear that steroids are 
worth a meter at the highest level of sports francis said i 
think he understood that his competitors were on them 
francis only previous statement since the olympics was that the 
sprinters urine test may have been sabotaged 
in four hours of testimony francis said johnson was among 
several canadian athletes who had received steroids from george 
astaphan the st kitts doctor accused of administering the steroid 
found in johnsons urine sample taken after johnson set the world 
record in seoul 
astaphan has denied the charge 
francis said toplevel international competition is virtually 
impossible without steroids which have harmful sideeffects 
he cautioned against believing any claims from toplevel athletes 
that they are clean and that their records are the result only of 
hard work 
it just isnt true not at the highest level francis said 
he said repeatedly that steroids are not a short cut but the 
reason toplevel athletes are able to train as hard as they do

consumers shouldnt be afraid that aflatoxin is 
going to show up in their food even though the recent drought 
created conditions under which the carcinogen thrives says 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter 
any time we have a drought we are going to see more aflatoxin 
problems yeutter said wednesday before the house appropriations 
subcommittee on rural development agriculture and related agencies 
that doesnt mean were going to have more in the food supply 
or any that slips in is going to hurt anyone 
in answer to a question from rep richard durbin dill yeutter 
said a recent article in the wall street journal reporting that 
aflatoxintainted corn is moving through the nations food chain 
focuses on the worst case scenarios 
it articulates a viewpoint that has scare dimensions to it 
he said 
everyone is going to do their best to minimize the risk of 
letting aflatoxin into the food supply he said nobody in the 
food chain wants it 
he said the government cannot guarantee a riskfree world but 
there arent people trying to slip aflatoxinladen products into 
the food supply 
the heat and drought that year were ideal for the fungus that 
produces aflatoxin which researchers have linked to the development 
of liver cancer in laboratory rats 
on tuesday the food and drug administration said about 6 percent 
95 samples out of 1650 of the field corn tested in recent 
months had higher levels 
that corn cannot be used for human consumption but can be 
diverted to feed nondairy cattle the fda said 
fda tested about 263 samples of corn flour and corn meal and 
found 2 percent or six samples to have more than 20 parts of 
aflatoxin per billion fda policy requires that these products be 
removed from the market 
yeutter also discussed international trade reform with the 
committee saying the climate for change is better than it has been 
in a decade 
he said that there are some hurdles the united states and 
european community must work out before talks in the uruguay round 
resume next month in geneva 
im cautiously optimistic well get that worked out between now 
and april he told the committee 
the united states has been seeking removal of government 
subsidies on exports worldwide but its position has been unpopular 
with other nations 
what happens in the uruguay round will determine what we should 
have in farm legislation yeutter said 
he said he doesnt anticipate any significant changes from the 
1985 farm bill that is due to expire in 1990 he said congress could 
extend the 1985 law until the uruguay talks are complete or pass a 
new bill and amend it as necessary after the negotiations

john tower is challenging the senate to live up 
to the same standards by which it is judging him saying senators 
sometimes vote after drinking alcohol and that he doubts he is alone 
in having broken his marriage vows 
nobodys perfect the secretary of defensedesignate seemed to be 
saying in his speech wednesday to the national press club 
even before tower spoke the leader of the senates democratic 
majority george mitchell of maine said in a speech that it is 
not moral perfection or the qualifications of senators that are at 
issue here 
the things that are at issue are far different than they used to 
be however 
tower devoted his press club speech to defense policy questions 
saying these are the subjects that normally occupy the mind of the 
nominee of secretary of defense 
they are not the subjects that have dominated his confirmation 
proceedings 
nor for that matter did these or similar dry subjects force 
gary hart from the race for the democratic presidential nomination 
or sidetrack president reagans nomination of douglas ginsburg to be 
a supreme court justice 
hart who served on the senate armed services committee when 
tower was its chairman withdrew from the white house contest in may 
1987 after a newspaper story that he had spent a night with a 
parttime actress while his wife was out of town 
were all going to have to seriously question the system for 
selecting our national leaders that reduces the press of this nation 
to hunters and presidential candidates to being hunted hart said 
at the time 
ginsburg withdrew from contention for the supreme court seat in 
november 1987 saying his views on the law had been drowned out 
in the clamor over his admission that he smoked marijuana as a 
student in the 1960s and a harvard law school professor in the 1970s 
in towers case opponents have zeroed in on his drinking and 
relations with women as well as his activities as a consultant to 
defense contractors the nominee says he has cut out all drinking 
except for wine with meals and will eliminate that too if he is 
confirmed 
tom korologos a lobbyist and former nixon white house official 
who has guided a number of republican nominations through the 
senate said he could remember no confirmation battle so dominated 
by personal issues 
this one has no constituency out there nobody rising up and 
down over a policy over an environmental or a strategic issue 
korologos said this is all personal and its unfortunate that 
the senate has come to this 
mitchell announcing his opposition to tower saw it differently 
public officials have a right to a private life he said 
they do not have a right to engage publicly in behavior which 
could interfere with the discharge of their public duties 
a single lapse in judgment or perhaps even a few should not 
disqualify an individual from public service mitchell continued 
but when the lapses in judgment form a pattern of many 
incidents spanning many years and when there is insufficient 
evidence to demonstrate that the pattern has been broken then there 
are reasonable grounds to question whether the individual possesses 
the qualities necessary for the uniquely demanding job of the 
secretary of defense 
tower said he agreed that the nominee for the top pentagon job 
should be held to a high standard but also asked whether it is 
acceptable for members of the senate who had a few drinks in 
hideaways to come onto the floor late in the evening and vote on 
vital issues of nuclear deterrence 
then when he was asked whether he had ever broken wedding vows 
the twicedivorced and now single exsenator said as a matter 
of fact i have broken wedding vows i think i am probably not alone 
in that connection 
it was an extraordinary confession for an american political 
figure hart although he admitted poor judgment said he did not do 
anything immoral during his night with actressmodel donna rice and 
refused to answer questions about whether he had ever committed 
adultery

conservative activists are trying to generate 
grassroots support for john tower but republican party officials 
around the nation concede they havent seen much of a groundswell of 
support for president bushs pentagon nominee 
senator tower is being victimized by a partisan power play on 
the part of some democrats in the united states senate said a 
newspaper ad run wednesday by conservative future pac 
an exercise in rumormongering and the most vile form of 
partisan politics was how l brent bozell iii director of the 
conservative victory committee described the opposition to the 
former texas senator 
the conservative groups that are making the tower confirmation a 
partisan confrontation may be suffering from the early damage done 
by one of their own paul weyrich of the free congress foundation 
testified against tower last month before the senate armed services 
committee raising allegations of drinking and womanizing 
on the party level mark goodin communications director for the 
republican national committee said efforts were under way to 
generate support for tower but local gop officials said they hadnt 
been contacted 
no one has called me from the rnc to talk about the tower 
situation at all said dwight adams chairman of the south dakota 
republican party sen larry pressler of south dakota was among the 
wavering republicans 
another undecided republican senator was charles grassley of 
iowa his state party chairman rich schwarm said i dont think 
anyone would want to pressure sen grassley by generating a 
groundswell 
i havent been asked to do anything said jean sullivan a 
republican national committeewoman from alabama the state has two 
democratic senators richard shelby has announced his opposition to 
tower and howell heflin is among the undecided 
mrs sullivan said she thought republicans could generate some 
pressure on heflin but i dont like pressure tactics we 
could beat him up pretty good 
but she went on national party officials better tell us what 
they want us to start doing 
in north carolina robert jones spokesman for the state 
republican party said he knew of no effort to generate a 
groundswell for tower 
we personally havent done anything he said 
that was in sharp contrast to the effort made last year on behalf 
of the nomination of robert h bork to the supreme court 
we did quite a bit of work on that said jones there was a 
strong matter of principle involved 
asked if the tower nomination was a political issue in his state 
fred logan the kansas gop chairman replied i dont think so 
senate gop leader bob dole of kansas has been leading the fight 
for confirmation but his kansas colleague nancy kassebaum is among 
the undecided 
mary alice lair a national committeewoman from kansas said 
certainly our sen dole is doing his part 
asked if there was any effort to convince kassebaum to support 
tower mrs lair said we are trying but you know she has a 
mind of her own which i respect 
i have not been asked by anyone to have any contact with her 
said fred logan the kansas republican party chairman nancy 
kassebaum is going to make up her own mind and i trust her 
judgment

the california resort community of palm springs 
sizzled into first place as the nations warmest community in 1988 
while the small town of gunnison colo held on as the coldest spot 
for the fourth year in a row 
rankings based on the number of times a community was the hottest 
or coldest in the 48 contiguous states gave gunnison nestled in the 
rockies a wide lead over all competitors with 93 daily lows during 
1988 
palm springs calif won a narrower victory with 43 daily highs 
according to the report in weatherwise magazine 
geography professor david h hickcox of ohio wesleyan university 
in delaware ohio compiles the annual rankings his study covers 
inhabited cities and towns with national weather service stations 
excluded are such extreme locations as alaska death valley calif 
and mount washington nh 
hickcox reported the nations mean temperature last year at 53 
degrees fahrenheit calculated by averaging the highs and lows from 
the reporting stations that average was the same as the year before 
and 1 degree colder than in 1986 
palm springs topped the 1988 hotpoint list by moving up from 
fourth place a year before hickcox reported 
second in both years was bullhead city ariz it was a close 
competitor in 1988 recording the nations warmest reading 41 times 
mcallen texas which had been no 1 in 1987 fell to third 
place with 31 days as hottest in 1988 
placing fourth in 1988 was laredo texas which was the national 
hotspot 29 times fort myers fla rounded out the top five with 27 
appearances as the warmest community in america 
just five states accounted for 97 percent of the nations daily 
high temperatures last year california texas arizona florida

dry soil and poor stands of winter wheat in 
parts of the nations breadbasket are pushing up prices and adding 
to the jitters of farmers and grain traders who nervously watch the 
agriculture departments daily price averages 
if prices are pushed much higher millions of bushels of wheat 
that farmers have locked up in storage bins could be released for 
sale on the market 
the watchfulness involves the farmerowned reserve of grain 
popularly called for in which growers store their product and 
collect 265 cents per bushel annually from the government as a 
storage fee the grain is technically stored under price support 
loan arrangements 
as part of the agreement the wheat must remain in storage and 
off the market until market prices rise enough to trigger release of 
the grain 
at that point the for grain can be redeemed without penalty and 
used or sold as farmers see fit or growers can leave it in the for 
and continue collecting storage payments subject to monthly review 
the trigger level for release of for wheat is 423 per bushel 
as of feb 29 the average price was 412 per bushel only 11 cents 
below the trigger level the price is a 5day average 
carl schwensen executive vice president of the national 
association of wheat growers said here wednesday that the price 
increases are welcomed by farmers but he had not heard any great 
concern about the for being triggered imminently 
one immediate factor he said is the usdas monthly adjustment 
of the formula used to determine the 5day wheat price average this 
adjustment which will reflect march 1 computations is expected to 
take as much as five cents off the 412 that was reported for feb 
28 
even so tight wheat supplies and uncertainties about the 1989 
us harvest are big factors in the price situation and will be for 
many weeks 
the departments economic research service says in a new analysis 
that the for wheat inventory as of feb 8 stood at 379 million 
bushels 
about 97 million bushels of that wheat is stored under loan 
arrangements expected to mature through may farmers have the option 
of paying off the loans or forfeiting the wheat to the departments 
commodity credit corp 
loan repayments can be made in cash or with certificates issued 
by the department in partial payment under commodity programs the 
certificates are redeemable in ccc commodities 
another factor that could reduce inventories would be if wheat 
market prices rose to the release level of 423 per bushel the 
report said the 5day average rose to 415 on feb 1 slipped to 
408 by feb 21 but then regained strength 
if the for were triggered farmers could either redeem their 
loans without penalty or leave their grain in the reserve the 
report said storage payments would continue but we reviewed on 
the first day of the second month following the initial trigger 
if the 5day average farm price held at or above the 423 level 
storage payments would end and the loans would begin to bear 
interest which the farmer would have to pay the government 
the report said that if storage payments end some farmers 
would have little incentive to leave their grain in the reserve 
particularly if they were accruing interest charges

an agriculture department analysis says last 
years settlement of a trade dispute with south korea cleared the 
way for rapid growth in us sales of cigarettes and leaf tobacco to 
that country 
cigarette manufacturers have clearly won by gaining access to 
this market which earned them 564 million in 1988 and holds 
promise for even greater annual earnings in the future the 
departments foreign agricultural service said 
shipments of unmanufactured leaf tobacco to south korea last 
year were valued at less than 10 million but that was the most 
since us leaf exports were about 40 million in 1981 the 564 
million in cigarette shipments was the most ever 
us cigarettes have historically faced stringent trade 
restrictions in this market the report said prior to 1986 it 
was illegal for korean citizens even to possess foreign cigarettes 
this prohibition was lifted in 1986 but us cigarettes continued 
to face tought trade restrictions 
the restrictions led the us cigarette export association to 
file a complaint with the us trade representative on jan 1 1988 
charging that south korea violated section 301 of us trade act 
under the 1974 law the president can take action including 
retaliation to obtain the removal of any foreign barrier in 
violation of international agreement or deemed discriminatory 
negotiations produced a record of understanding signed with 
south korea on may 27 1988 which eased restrictions on us 
cigarettes carried out by the korean monopoly corp or komoco 
soon after the agreement was signed us manufacturers began 
to sign sales agreements with korean firms and us cigarette 
exports began to explode the report said 
in june 1988 us cigarette shipments to south korea increased 
30fold from may for the entire year sales totaled 24 billion 
cigarettes or pieces a 670 percent increase from 312 million 
pieces in 1987

the chief democratic architect of ethics 
legislation in congress is pleased that president bushs commission 
decided the basic conflictofinterest law cannot be applied to 
senators and representatives but he describes another panel idea as 
terrible 
i welcomed the panel agreeing with us on the conflict 
question said rep barney frank dmass who drafted the house 
version of ethics legislation that president reagan vetoed last 
year reagan based his veto in part on differences in the way the 
bill treated congress and the executive branch 
but frank did not approve of the way the bush panel resolved its 
most divisive issue limits on moonlighting income for judges 
members of congress top federal officials and senior aides in all 
three branches 
bush had launched his eightmember commission in january with 
instructions to come up with standards equitable across all three 
branches of the federal government 
nevertheless bushs commission decided that the basic law which 
prevents executive officials from taking government action affecting 
their financial interests could not be applied to members of 
congress for constitutional and other reasons 
they recognized the big difference between the executive and 
congress in saying that you cant apply the basic conflict statute 
to congress because everybody up here works on everything when they 
vote frank said in an interview wednesday 
frank also hailed the panels decision to call for officials in 
all three branches to take a oneyear coolingoff period before they 
lobby or appear before their former colleagues on any issue we 
had the oneyear coolingoff period in last years legislation but 
had to give up on it because of opposition said frank who has 
reintroduced a version of last years bill 
with a series of decisions at its fifth meeting wednesday the 
commission wrapped up all but the final drafting of a report it 
hopes to give bush late next week most of the recommendations 
require approval by him and congress 
the bush panel was unable to agree tuesday or wednesday on what 
types of outside work do not raise ethical issues or interfere with 
the full performance of official duties they wanted to exempt these 
pursuits from any limits on moonlighting income 
former white house counsel lloyd cutler suggested listing 
teaching by judges among others but former attorney general 
griffin bell who wanted to exempt royalties from books or 
inventions objected to exempting teaching by judges 
when you get above 15 percent of salary for teaching youre 
not a fulltime government worker bell said youre not in your 
office when youre teaching and you need to be there so other judges 
can talk to you 
so they decided the president should be empowered by a new law to 
designate categories of work that would be exempt from any limits on 
outside earnings for all three branches 
frank rejected that notion out of hand 
for the president to set rules for what outside work the 
congress can do i dont understand that at all frank said 
thats just a terrible idea it would be better to have each 
branch set the rules for the other branch 
other conclusions of the bush panel were 
congress should set the overall limit on outside earnings at a 
percentage of an officials salary most of the group favored a 
figure closer to the 15 percent which now governs the executive 
branch the judiciary has no limit the house limit is 30 percent of 
salary the senate limit 40 percent 
lesser penalties should be introduced for violations of 
conflictofinterest laws which now carry felony sentences by 
providing alternative prosecutorial tools that can be more carefully 
tailored to the offense these sanctions may expand the number of 
enforcement actions bell said

a national research council report that said 
vitamin pills and some other dietary supplements are useless and 
perhaps harmful was denounced as a disservice to all americans 
by a trade group 
the group called the council for responsible nutrition said 
that the nrc report released wednesday failed to acknowledge what it 
called emerging research on benefits from supplements of 
vitamins fiber and calcium 
the nrc report provides only a shallow review of the evidence 
on the benefits of nutritional supplements and fails to reflect the 
tide of research that supports those benefits the trade 
association said in a prepared statement 
the nrc on wednesday released a 1300page report that is a 
compilation by 19 experts of research from many sources related to 
diet and health the threeyear study concluded that health is best 
maintained by a balanced diet of a variety of foods in a diet that 
is reduced in fat and salt and enriched with fruits vegetables and 
complex carbohydrates 
the study said the nrc committee found no conclusive evidence 
that taking doses of supplemental vitamins fiber or calcium would 
provide protection from cancer heart disease embrittlement of 
bones or other ailments 
annette dickinson a nutrition expert and a spokeswoman for the 
trade group said the nrc finding is unrealistic because it did not 
recognize that the food eaten by many americans does not include all 
the nutrients in the recommended dietary allowance developed by the 
federal government 
people simply are not getting those required amounts said 
ms dickinson we believe that it is better that they get them 
nutrients somewhere than not at all 
she said the nrc study is backing away from the use of a 
number of supplements that have been shown to be quite 
effective she said that the report springs from a bias against 
supplements in favor of a balanced diet 
ms dickinson acknowledged that research reports on the value of 
supplements have had mixed results historically and admitted that 
there is a lot of bias on both sides about their use 
the nrc study said that dietary supplements was a 3 billion 
business in 1987 and that many doctors nurses and nutritionists 
take multivitamins and other supplements it said many people 
selfprescribe supplements containing nutrients far in excess of the 
rda set by the federal government 
a daily dose of multiple vitamins with 100 percent of the rda 
is not known to be harmful or beneficial the report said 
however vitaminmineral supplements that exceed the rda and other 
supplements such as protein powders single amino acids fiber and 
lecithin not only have no known health benefits but their use 
may be detrimental to health 
though the study recommended foods high in calcium it noted that 
the potential benefits of calcium intakes above the rdas to 
prevent osteoporosis or hypertension are not well documented and do 
not justify the use of calcium supplements 
fiber supplements by themselves the report said did not confer 
any protection against disease but fiber taken with fruits 
vegetables grains and legumes are beneficial the study recommended 
five or more servings daily of fruit or vegetables and six or more 
servings of bread cereals or legumes

a man whose capital murder conviction has 
been overturned after he spent 13 years behind bars says he wont be 
satisfied until his innocence is proven through a new trial 
if the case is dropped where does that leave me randall dale 
adams told the associated press on wednesday after a state appeals 
court overturned his conviction it leaves me on the courthouse 
steps with nothing 
the texas court of criminal appeals ruled that adams whose 
conviction for the 1976 slaying of a dallas police officer was 
questioned in the film the thin blue line had been denied a 
fair trial because witnesses lied and the prosecutor suppressed 
evidence 
it ordered the 40yearold adams transferred from the eastham 
unit state prison to the custody of dallas county where he will be 
entitled to release on bond said his attorney randy schaffer 
this is what ive been asking for for 13 years im happy to 
have a second chance adams said 
i felt from the beginning i would win this case he added 
its taken 12 13 years i have never had a doubt this would 
come 
the case attracted attention last year with the release of errol 
morris documentary morris said from los angeles he was delighted 
and relieved and hoped people realized that adams was not getting 
off on a technicality 
randall adams is truly an innocent man morris said and 
there was a terrible miscarriage of justice 12 years ago 
the dallas county district attorney will decide soon whether to 
pursue a retrial said assistant prosecutor norm kinne 
although adams said he does not believe the state will retry him 
schaffer predicted prosecutors will insist on a new trial for 
political reasons 
i am certain the state does not have evidence to persuade a 
jury beyond a reasonable doubt that adams committed this crime he 
said every witness in the case has been totally and completely 
discredited 
asked whether he was bitter adams said ive had 13 years 
taken from my life can the state replace that 
adams has worked as a clerk in the prison maintenance office and 
earned an associate degree in general studies while imprisoned 
prison is not the life i would have wanted to live but it is a 
life and i think i have used it wisely he said i have a 
college education and many more job skills than when i came here i 
like the person i am today 
in 1979 adams was within three days of death when his execution 
was stayed the next year his death sentence was commuted to life 
you do not come three days from execution without changing 
adams said i am a different man from the one who was locked up in 
december 1976 i have grown in my own way as much as possible to 
build my inner life my family life 
if i could change anything i would never have been in dallas 
in texas 
the appellate judges said prosecutor doug mulder suppressed 
evidence and knowingly allowed perjured testimony during adams 1977 
trial 
mulder did not return phone calls for comment 
it is the fundamental constitutional purpose of this court to 
insure that a convicted defendant received a fair trial wrote 
judge mp duncan when deceit produces court rulings that have 
the effect of denying one a fair trial then the conviction should be 
vacated 
the court said the state knowingly suppressed evidence that 
witness emily miller had failed to identify adams in a police 
lineup that a police officer advised her she didnt identify adams 
and that the officer told her the person she should have identified 
it also said ms miller committed perjury by testifying she had 
identified adams in the lineup 
the film suggests that david harris who was the chief accuser in 
the 1977 trial committed the slaying 
harris recanted his testimony in the movie and again during a 
december hearing before state district judge larry baraka harris is 
on death row for another slaying 
we would have won this case without david harris but i 
appreciate the fact that he was willing to talk adams said 
i would like to say i forgive david harris but that is very 
hard to do david harris has to pay for his crimes he said 
on nov 28 1976 adams ran out of gas while driving home from 
work harris a 16yearold at the time who had stolen a car helped 
adams get gas and spent part of the day with him 
officer robert wood was fatally shot that night by a motorist he 
had pulled over on a traffic violation harris testified in 1977 
that adams killed wood adams said he and harris then 16 parted 
company long before the shooting 
adams mother mildred adams of columbus ohio was overjoyed at 
the news of the ruling 
we had planned on going down to tdc over easter break to see 
him she said now i just dont have the words to express 
myself were just as happy as can be up here

nasa plans to land robot probes on a comet and 
on a moon of saturn early next century in new programs that would 
cost 16 billion over the next seven years 
in testimony prepared for a budget hearing before the house 
committee on science space and technology national aeronautics and 
space administration scientist lennard a fisk said wednesday that 
the unmanned spacecraft would allow the united states to maintain 
world leadership in exploration of the solar system 
fisk the associate nasa administrator for space science and 
applications said a mission called comet rendezvous asteroid flyby 
or craf would be launched in 1995 and would streak through space 
for five years before meeting in space with the comet kopff and 
dropping a probe to its surface 
he said the probe from the spacecraft would penetrate to the core 
of the comet and study the chemistry of material that may date from 
the beginning of the solar system 
a second mission called cassini would be launched in 1996 and 
arrive in an orbit of the planet saturn in the year 2002 
once there fisk said the craft would drop a robot lander to the 
surface of titan one of saturns moons and conduct a chemical 
analysis 
this study said the scientist could provide a fundamental 
understanding about the origins of life 
the chemistry that gave rise to life in the past is no longer 
available for us to study on earth he said however we 
believe that a chemistry similar to that on the early earth 
exists today on titan 
the two missions said fisk will both study primordial pristine 
matter the material from which the solar system formed the 
material from which life on earth formed and the chemistry which 
gave rise to that life 
fisk said that the missions will require an appropriation of 30 
million in fiscal year 1990 with increases every year that follows 
for a total of about 16 billion by the time the spacecraft are 
launched 
he said the opportunity to fly the missions may be lost if the 
money is not approved this year because the planetary alignment will 
change and make the missions impossible

leaders of a second major education group have 
gone on record opposing the idea of beaming commercials into the 
classroom as part of a televised news program designed for 
teenagers 
the national parentteacher association said wednesday its 
22member executive committee took the position this weekend in 
response to a venture called channel one proposed by whittle 
communciations lp a tennesseebased media concern 
whittle has proposed giving thousands of high schools about 
50000 worth of television sets and other electronic equipment each 
to beam to them a daily 12minute news show that would include up to 
two minutes of commercials 
the show would be sent by satellite to participating schools 
which would be expected to show the program to the entire student 
body each school day 
we applaud the efforts to bring new technology and creative 
means of instruction into our schools national pta president 
manya ungar said 
however we are opposed to making the availability of that 
technology and programming contingent upon subjecting a captive 
student audience to the promotion of commecial products or 
services 
the pta has 64 million members in 26000 local units across the 
country 
on monday leaders of the national association of secondary 
school principals voted without specifically mentioning channel 
one to urge schools against participating in ventures in which 
commercials are inserted into educational programs 
whittle plans to begin testing its service in six schools 
starting next week its chairman christopher whittle showed a 
prototype of the program to pta leaders last weekend before the vote 
im sorry they feel that way said william s rukeyser 
editorinchief of whittle communications to say the commercials 
are unacceptable while the program is acceptable is begging the 
question 
he said educators have said for a decade that a televised news 
program could benefit students but have never found a way to pay 
for it 
wed be delighted to produce all this and send it to the 
schools but that is a fantasy he said 
he said critics of the program should withhold judgment until the 
pilot tests are completed the test is expected to run through april 
the 5 million test of the channel one program starts monday at 
eisenhower middle school in kansas city kan mumford high school 
in detroit central high school in knoxville tenn billerica 
memorial high school in billerica mass withrow high school in 
cincinnati and gahr high school in cerritos calif

the city is saturated with aliens denied 
jobs because of the new immigration law possibly leading to this 
weeks arrests of 175 suspected illegal immigrants smuggled east on 
airlines officials said 
a year ago wed average five men a night sleeping in our 
church we now have 90 we also have 40 women and children in our 
convent said the rev gregory boyle pastor of mission dolores a 
roman catholic parish that has become a refuge to illegal immigrants 
from mexico and central america 
us immigration and naturalization service agents on wednesday 
arrested 27 more suspected illegal aliens aboard a piedmont airlines 
flight during a stop in charlotte nc between phoenix and new 
york 
the journey of the salvadorans ecuadorans mexicans and 
brazilians began with an america west flight from los angeles to 
phoenix authorities said 
on monday 79 suspected illegal aliens taking eastern airlines 
red eye from los angeles to new york were arrested during a stop 
in atlanta late monday 69 were arrested while boarding the same 
flight in los angeles 
the 1986 immigration control and reform act hits employers with 
sanctions if they hire illegal aliens on wednesday a california 
farm labor contractor accused of more than 330 violations of the law 
became the first agricultural business in the nation to be fined 
under the law 
sampa farm contractors of madera was fined 153250 for employing 
27 illegal aliens who were arrested during border patrol sweeps in 
january said j william carter chief of the border patrol office 
in livermore 
some officials say the law may be the reason why illegal 
immigrants are turning away from their longtime destination los 
angeles and california farms 
neil jacobs the assistant ins director for investigations in 
atlanta described los angeles as literally saturated with 
aliens and said word has gotten around that they cant get jobs 
boyle agreed and said it stems from the immigration law reform 
my feeling is there is a saturation here he said noting 
that movement into the agricultural san joaquin valley evaporated 
months ago 
smugglers use of airlines is not new although it is not 
considered commonplace the charlotte arrests were the third for 
that piedmont flight since october 
apparently theyve been using the flight for the last three 
months pretty regularly said david carmichael ins supervisor in 
charlotte 
in the case of easterns red eye flight 80 the ins believes 
several smugglers were taking advantage of low fares to move the 
aliens who are subject to deportation if caught 
this flight we are hopeful will be closed to smugglers of 
aliens but we expect there will be other flights in the future 
said donald h looney acting district director of the ins in los 
angeles 
airlines say they cooperate with the ins but do not have policies 
of trying to determine if any passengers might be illegal immigrants 
we dont engage in trying to detect these types of 
passengers said eastern spokeswoman virginia sanchez in miami 
thats what the ins is there for if they wish to enforce their 
immigration regulations thats part of their job 
america west reserves the right to ask any passenger for 
identification but that would not be operationally possible 
considering the airline carried 13 million passengers last year 
said spokesman dick shimizu 
im sure you would be able to see the enormous delays 
delta a major airline serving los angeles also doesnt check 
identification said spokeswoman glenda hatchett johnson in atlanta 
boyle the parish pastor is not convinced that large numbers are 
leaving los angeles especially by the smuggling schemes that the 
ins said cost aliens up to 4000 the concept of 4000 i cant 
even wrap my mind about that one he said 
he is certain however that illegal immigrants will continue to 
come 
as hopeless as things are becoming here its even more so from 
where they come boyle said 
nightly now theres not a single square foot of place left 
where a person could lie down

two federal agencies hope to fight aids among 
heroin addicts by making methadone treatments available to more 
addicts sooner and thus reducing exposure to aids through 
needlesharing 
the plan to be published in todays federal register was 
proposed by the food and drug administration and the national 
institute on drug abuse it would allow interim methadone treatment 
in cities where comprehensive treatment programs have waiting lists 
intravenous heroin addicts often share needles and in doing so 
become infected with the virus that causes the deadly disease 
methadone which is used to help relieve an addicts craving for 
heroin is taken by mouth which eliminates the risk from needles 
although methadone is best used as part of a comprehensive 
treatment program that includes counseling and other vocational and 
rehabilitative services many clinics have waiting lists of six 
months or more the agencies said

a common domestic cat served as a surrogate 
mother to give birth to a wildcat in a technique that researchers 
say can help save endangered species 
the embryo of an endangered indian desert cat was implanted into 
the house cat by in vitro fertilization cincinnati zoo officials 
said wednesday the offspring was born feb 7 
there are millions of domestic cats and so few of these exotic 
cats said betsy dresser research director at the zoos center 
for reproduction of endangered wildlife 
zoo officials said they believed it was the first time a common 
domestic cat was used as the surrogate mother 
the university of florida veterinary school has implanted embryos 
from the endangered florida panther in texas mountain lions and in 
vitro fertilization involving a leopard cat has been used at the 
national zoo in washington dc 
the cincinnati center has made breakthroughs during the past few 
years with its work in embryo transplants from one species to 
another researchers successfully have frozen embryos thawed them 
and transplanted them into other animals 
the aim is to develop the technology and techniques for 
transplanting embryos from endangered species into more common 
animals thus increasing the chances of the species survival 
the center has successfully transplanted the embryos of an exotic 
species to a common one with different types of antelope and cows 
ms dressers work was praised by an official at the san diego 
zoo which also has been researching how to help reproduction of 
endangered animal species 
we salute this type of work because there are so many species 
in dire straits today any method devoted to the enhancement of 
production of endangered species our organization wholeheartedly 
supports said tom hanscom spokesman for the san diego zoo wild 
animal park 
ms dresser said the center has been studying cats for several 
years to learn more about their reproduction for such a transfer 
eggs and sperm were gathered from desert cats the eggs were 
fertilized in a glass dish and the embryos were implanted in the 
domestic cat two embryos survived but one of the kittens was born 
dead 
the desert cat is a close relative to the domestic cat with 
similar size and appearance 
the mother is treating the kitten like a regular offspring but 
the kitten wont take on characteristics of the mother 
she thinks she had the ugliest kid on the block dresser 
joked every time you pick up the desert cat and put it back she 
gives it a bath 
the researchers decided to use two closely related types of cat 
for the first transfer they are not sure which other cat species 
are close enough to permit such transfers 
we dont know in the relationships how far away you can go 
ms dresser said 
the next round of work at the center will involve transfers of 
jungle cat and golden cat embryos the work also will help them 
understand the similiarities and differences between cat species 
this is a new way to allow us to look at the physiological 
side ms dresser said

subway gunman bernhard goetz who comes up for 
parole sunday should remain jailed for his full oneyear term 
because early release would encourage recidivism the prosecutor 
said 
assistant district attorney gregory waples in a letter wednesday 
to the state parole board chairman said goetz had shown no remorse 
for his dec 22 1984 shooting of four youths on a subway train 
conditional release would increase the likelihood of 
recidivism by signaling to goetz if only in some subtle and 
unintended way that the law does not truly mean what it says 
wrote waples 
the prosecutor also cited goetzs outspoken advocacy of arming 
citizens with handguns 
one of the four youths remains paralyzed from the incident goetz 
was sentenced jan 13 on a weapons conviction

freezing temperatures for the season 
she spent her first 13 winters at sea worlds in orlando fla 
and in san diego but comes from hardy stock she was captured off 
iceland 
this has perhaps been her coldest weather said stan w 
searles curator at the 90acre sea world marine park 30 miles 
southeast of cleveland 
during past winters shamu a stage name shared by killer whales 
at other sea worlds has been transported to orlando or san diego 
because of research or breeding needs 
this has been a very mild winter for ohio searles said in an 
interview in his office tucked inside the back of shamus 4000seat 
stadium it is not a problem for her she has a huge blubber 
layer 
six inches in all according to searles 
he adjusts shamus winter diet to provide her with more calories 
because she must expend more energy to keep warm amid the cold air 
even if the water in her openair pool is kept at about 55 degrees 
yearround 
shes certainly aware that its colder he said because 
shes breathing colder air 
on a recent day when snow was swirling in the wind and the 
temperature dipped to 14 degrees shamu was active and ready to play 
when trainer beth riegelmayer appeared in a multicolored wet suit 
with a bucket of fish 
searles whose staff feeds shamu 140 pounds of frozen fish daily 
sometimes cuts back the rations of herring smelt and squid to 130 
pounds if shes less interested 
we can just tell shes not as hungry said seales who 
increases calorierich herring portions when shamu requires more 
food to stay warm on cold days

leftist rebels have rejected the 
armys unilateral ceasefire as a publicity maneuver and stepped 
up attacks saying they will only accept a negotiated truce in the 
9yearold civil war 
later wednesday prospects improved for arranging peace talks 
with the guerrillas who are trying to negotiate participation in 
national elections 
president jose napoleon duarte secured the support of ricardo 
alvarenga president of the oppositioncontrolled legislature for 
direct talks with the rebels and called on them to cease hostilities 
as a sign of good will 
the legislative assembly is controlled by the rightist republican 
nationalist alliance or arena which has rejected guerrilla demands 
that the march 19 presidential vote be postponed so they can 
organize a campaign arena of which alvarenga is a leader is 
leading in the presidential polls 
the rebels have offered to take part in national elections 
which they have previously boycotted and respect the outcome if 
their demand for postponement until september and securityrelated 
concerns are met 
after a fivehour meeting wednesday duarte and alvarenga told 
journalists they had agreed to form a government commission for 
talks with guerrilla commanders 
there must be a cessation of hostilities in order to begin 
conversations alvarenga said 
duarte whose government is backed by the united states urged 
the rebel faribundo marti national liberation front to take such a 
step but also said it is not a prerequisite 
the rebels on wednesday ignored the armys threemonth unilateral 
ceasefire and attacked a garrison town in la union the easternmost 
province just before the army truce began at midnight tuesday 
rebels attacked a coffeeprocessing plant six miles north of san 
salvador 
the rebels reported killing 67 soldiers and wounding 25 in the 
attack on the garrison at santa rosa de lima 110 miles east of san 
salvador the army said two soldiers two rebels and a civilian were 
killed and seven soldiers wounded in a twohour attack 
a ceasefire not negotiated between opposing forces is not 
real said a statement issued by the rebel general command we 
demand a serious response from the government to our communique 
regarding negotiations in the capital 
on sunday duarte proposed that direct negotiations with the 
rebels begin in guatemala city on tuesday and that a ceasefire 
first take effect 
the rebels insist any talks be held in san salvador among and 
in full view of all salvadorans beginning saturday duarte 
reiterated guatemala as his personal preference on wednesday 
once we agree on a date for a meeting in the capital we will 
declare a cessation of offensive operations according to the 
rebel commands wednesday statement 
we consider that the supposed unilateral ceasefire of the 
armed forces does not halt repression in the cities nor does it 
withdraw troops from operations in the countryside it is a 
publicity maneuver to give the impression of flexibility 
state department spokesman charles redman said wednesday in 
washington this decision by president duarte and the salvadoran 
armed forces addresses the most critical issue that of bringing 
peace to el salvador 
president duarte recognizes the crucial fact that violence and 
democracy dont mix we are now waiting for the guerrillas to 
demonstrate that they are willing to do the same by ceasing their 
ongoing campaign of terrorism and assassinations 
the war has claimed more than 70000 lives

some emergency powers introduced by britain in 1978 
to curb guerrilla action in northern ireland are not being renewed 
because they were found to cause widespread resentment northern 
ireland secretary tom king says 
king on wednesday asked wparliament to drop measures that compel 
crowds to disperse impose directions on the conduct of funerals and 
close drinking places 
parliament must renew the emergency powers annually for them to 
stay in effect 
lord colville a barrister who reviews the operation of 
counterterrorist laws in the britishruled province reported last 
month that rudeness on the part of police and soliders was stoking 
longterm resentment toward security forces 
he gave as an example the case of an unidentified man in 
londonderry who had been stopped 33 times last summer under 
emergency powers and detained each time for between 15 and 45 
minutes 
colville said winning hearts and minds should be a paramount 
preoccupation for the security forces 
king said in a house of commons written reply that he welcomed 
the recommendations

the entire town of bolan iowa took the stage of 
david lettermans show knowing the joke was on them but the 16 
residents say the last laugh was theirs 
they were wined and dined and eventually maligned during a 
threeday allexpensespaid adventure that saw them plucked from 
quiet obscurity in the corn and soybean fields of the midwest for a 
sudden assault on their senses in the big apple 
the moment in the sun for the entire population of bolans 
metropolitan area six bolanites and 10 from the suburbs came 
on nbctvs late night with david letterman 
they watched offstage on a monitor as comedian jeff altman the 
first guest told letterman and the audience that he walked past the 
bolanites to get on stage and one of them said who the hell is 
that 
larry nydegger 21 immediately defended himself 
it was me but i didnt say hell 
letterman whose show was taped late wednesday and broadcast 
early today held nothing back 
do you have like a town slut he asked 73yearold ruth 
hansen and if so when she comes up point her out 
mrs hansen a 50year resident chuckled 
also put on the spot was nydeggers 23yearold sister lori a 
weekend resident who admitted that she spends most of her week away 
from town 
so youre just here for the free trip letterman asked as 
she blushed and shook her head lets string her up 
lori nydegger was the one who helped draw attention to bolan 
during a 1986 centennial celebration 
she formed a standstill parade of floats marching band members 
on lawn chairs and grand marshals on cars all on the villages 
single street the spectators marched around it while the parade 
stood still 
the town is 130 miles north of des moines and consists of an 
antique shop a methodist church and the bolan store inc a farm 
equipment and supplies store that owns threefourths of the towns 
property and is for sale 
a 16acre property with a threebedroom home one of eight in 
bolan and its suburbs is also on the market for 42000 
the 103yearold community at one time had 75 residents as well 
as a general store a blacksmith a train depot a post office 
lumber yards stock yards and a creamery 
but the automobile changed everything and bolans population has 
remained relatively stable and small the last 20 years 
while they were away the bolanites arranged for friends or 
relatives to stay at each of their homes and hired additional 
security officers to protect their belongings 
letterman prompted by a staffer intrigued by bolan paid for the 
iowans trip they stayed at the mayflower hotel where they held a 
party after the taping and watched themselves on television 
earlier they toured manhattan and every corner seemed to bring 
something to turn their heads 
a man cursing loudly for no obvious reason passed near lori 
nydegger 
oh my she said they get kind of mad dont they 
her 17yearold brother loren said he was asked for money 
twice in one block 
im glad i grew up where i did he said 
comparing motorists in bolan and manhattan 59yearold daryl 
mccready said we wave at everybody they give each other the 
bird 
but mccready said the town was enjoying the trip even if some 
people were poking fun at them 
we have to laugh at ourselves too he said main street is 
720 feet long and it ends in a dead end in a corn field 
these people who might laugh at us would like to be in our 
place too mccready said were in the enviable position of 
being the only town that was flown for free to new york 
says mrs hansen the town of bolan got put back on the map 
especially after nbc and david letterman

a primary victory in his pocket democratic 
mayoral nominee richard m daley has taken a florida vacation as one 
foe hit the streets for the april 4 election and another wondered if 
hed make the ballot 
daley sought comfort in the sand leaving behind a tumultuous 
scene especially with the republican primary winner still 
undetermined and jesse jackson and his former presidential campaign 
manager national democratic party chief ron brown backing 
different candidates in the general election 
depending on how things shape up in the coming weeks said 
tom roesser a veteran political observer active in republican and 
civic circles there could be a lot of blood on the floor not to 
mention political futures by the time this thing is over 
for openers the chicago board of election commissioners planned 
to announce late today the winner of tuesdays republican primary 
edward vrdolyak who launched a lastminute writein campaign or 
herbert sohn the partys endorsed candidate 
the gop winner advances to next months contest against daley 
son of the legendary boss of chicago politics and alderman timothy 
evans a black who is mounting a thirdparty bid 
jackson who supported mayor eugene sawyer in the primary has 
shifted his allegiance to evans daley however received a pledge 
of support wednesday from brown although it was not known whether 
the chairman who like jackson and sawyer is black would actively 
campaign for daley 
daley headed south after two morning campaign stops surpising 
sleepyeyed commuters by showing up at a downtown train platform to 
shake hands just hours after vanquishing sawyer then squeezing into 
the front booth of a nearby deli for breakfast 
daley whose victory made chicago the first among the largest 
us cities to have a black incumbent mayor defeated by a white 
challenger appeared confident of getting a second victory next 
month 
he shrugged off predictions that vrdolyak who also is white 
would draw off many of the ethnic votes that form the core 
constituencies of both men and said he planned to ask sawyer for his 
endorsement 
he may have to do some armtwisting sawyer suggested he would 
not back daley or evans who is accused by many sawyer admirers of 
keeping blacks at home tuesday and sabotaging the primary 
my general sense is that i will not endorse anyone sawyer 
said i am thinking it through and ive got a lot of people to 
talk to before i decide 
evans began his day shaking hands at a train station then 
stopped at restaurants in the hispanic and white wards where daley 
rolled up impressive vote totals in the primary 
evans resumed his earlier criticism of the daley machine 
suggesting the younger daleys election would shut minorities out of 
city government and revive a closely controlled political and 
patronage system his father used to govern during six terms as mayor 
he campaigned in daleys home ward wednesday a predominantly 
white neighborhood called bridgeport and declared tim evans came 
and discovered people who are already committed to a progressive 
vision right in the belly of the beast 
evans said he would seek sawyers endorsement in a bid to reunite 
the coalition of voters who made the late harold washington the 
citys first black mayor in 1983 and four years later the first 
mayor to win reelection since the elder daley 
the war was fought hard and fought gallantly he said of 
sawyers supporters we offer them an opportunity to fight again 
but successfully 
a fight was virtually guaranteed on the republican side as well 
with 98 percent of the 2911 precincts reporting unofficial 
returns showed vrdolyak with 10711 votes or 45 percent to 10234 
votes or 43 percent for sohn two other candidates each had 5 
percent 
both have indicated they may seek a recount 
ive got a feeling this thing is far from over said tom 
leach election board spokesman

hundreds of students crowded the 
corridors and stairwells of their university to cheer the son of the 
last hungarian king who was giving his first public speech in 
communist hungary 
the unprecedented event occurred wednesday in a hall of the karl 
marx university of economics which proved too small to accommodate 
all who wanted to hear otto von habsburg the former hungarian crown 
prince 
von habsburg a 76yearold west german citizen arrived tuesday 
to join a visiting delegation of the european parliament 
the multilingual intellectual who is still addressed your 
majesty by some of his friends in austria and germany is a deputy 
to the strasbourg parliament from the bavarian christian social 
union 
his father emperor charles i of austria was crowned king 
charles iv in budapest dec 30 1916 two years before the 
austrohungarian monarchy collapsed 
the visit unthinkable only a few years ago comes as hungarys 
communist leaders are cautiously enacting a series of reforms under 
pressure from independent political groups which are demanding 
multiparty democracy 
von habsburg a symbol of nationalism for many hungarians was 
fully aware of the uniqueness of the occasion 
it marks a progress in the sense of a freer democracy that the 
oldest son of the last crowned king of hungary can deliver a lecture 
as representative of germany in the european parliament he said 
his lecture on hungarys place in contemporary europe 
delivered in faultless hungarian was the highpoint of his fourday 
visit and also a personal triumph 
the onetime pretender to the austrian and hungarian thrones was 
originally slated to speak to 50 or so members of a special 
university college at karl marx in a hall with a capacity for about 
250 
reporters covering the event estimated the crowd at about 700 
after his lecture von habsburg answered questions for at least 
45 minutes his busy schedule during his first official stay in 
hungary called for 20 different interviews speeches and meetings 
on wednesday he met with senior communist party and government 
officials including rezsoe nyers a leading economist and politburo 
member who is also a state minister in the government istvan 
huszar the general secretary of the hungarian peoples front a 
mass organization and laszlo kovacs a deputy foreign minister 
in his lecture von habsburg said he felt that rapprochement 
between the european community and hungary will become ever 
stronger 
one thing i want to assure my hungarian friends of we hold the 
door wide open for hungary in the european community he declared 
to applause 
von habsburg also pleased the audience by noting that on several 
occasions he had used hungarian in the european parliament to 
underscore that the the soviet bloc country has the right to be 
present in europe 
earlier in the day he attended part of a screening of a 
hungarian film that traces his life from his birth in 1912 to 
strasbourg and has been a boxoffice hit in budapest theaters for 
weeks

daughter in which she also gives some insights into her father 
the former president 
she writes that deaver the former deputy chief of staff came 
to my fathers administration not because he believed in ronald 
reagans conservative movement but because reagan was a 
political train that happened to be leaving the station and mike 
deaver wanted to be on board 
her opinion of former white house chief of staff regan is no 
higher he seemed to suffer from that rare snobbery of the greedy 
rich 
she said regan had his office remodeled to include an outdoor 
patio like the presidents and kept referring to him as cousin 
until reagan joked he would be accused of nepotism if regan didnt 
knock it off 
the official publication date of first father first daughter 
is april 3 but copies of the book will be in some stores near the 
end of next week jennifer kittredge a spokeswoman for publisher 
little brown amp co said wednesday

injuries to people from things flying around in the cabin there 
were ice buckets racks of glasses cartons of juice and bins of 
things around 
during the ordeal she said she instructed the passengers to 
tighten their seat belts grab their ankles and stay down until 
you know were back on earth and weve stopped 
when the captain announced that the plane was two minutes from 
the end of the runway people kept unfastening their seat belts 
and standing up to look out the windows she said im sure that 
they wanted the reassurance they wanted to see those honolulu city 
lights 
thats why im hoarse i screamed for two minutes grab your

a mother who wanted to bring her 
terminally ill 3yearold daughter home to die got a judges order 
granting her custody and read it aloud in the childs hospital room 
but little candice dutchak never made it home she died five 
minutes later 
it was almost like she was waiting for me to hand that order to 
her parents said sara rahdert an attorney who helped cheryl 
dutchak win back her daughter from state custody i know that 
sounds strange but that was what it was like 
mrs dutchak spent nearly a year fighting to bring candice home

fluid during her mothers pregnancy doctors had recommended an 
abortion 
complications kept the newborn in the hospital for two months 
she lost her right leg at the knee because of circulation problems 
and later her kidneys began to fail 
last march candice suffered brain damage after a seizure which 
doctors said occurred when mrs dutchak withheld medication mrs 
dutchak said an emergency room doctor told her to withhold the 
medicine 
in april the florida department of health and rehabilitative 
services charged mrs dutchak with child abuse and took the baby 
away 
the charge was dropped but the state retained custody and agreed 
to work out a compromise stating that the mother could take the 
baby home if she proved she was fit 
the babys condition worsened and on monday doctors called mrs 
dutchak and said candice was close to death 
ms rahdert sought an emergency custody order and a hearing was 
scheduled but department of health and rehabilitative sservices 
district administrator michael becker agreed for humanitarian 
reasons to release the girl to her mother 
circuit judge jack page signed the order transferring custody 
about 1245 pm the attorney said 
i dashed from the courthouse to the hospital cheryl

ms rahdert said about five minutes after mom read this order out 
loud to everyone in the room including the child the child died

state foresters who battled a fourday fire that 
scorched 17000 acres of the droughtparched everglades have offered 
1000 for information leading to the arrests of those who sparked 
the blaze 
the wildfire was finally doused wednesday afternoon as heavy 
rains moved into the area but firefighters planned to fly over the 
burned area today to check on any new fires said state forestry 
division duty officer phil deangelis in fort lauderdale 
we dont expect any problems with the fire restarting but it 
was an arson so you never know whats going to happen said 
deangelis 
investigators today still tried to pinpoint the origin of the 
massive fire which threatened power lines and forced some road 
closings because of thick smoke deangelis said 
another wildfire in southeast florida burned 4100 acres of 
cypress and palmetto trees and engulfed six camp buildings used by 
hunters in collier county before a brief shower helped firefighters 
contain it wednesday morning said duty officer roberta smith in 
fort myers 
it seemed like it rained right over the fire ms smith said 
that helped us out an awful lot 
the two blazes were the largest of more than 50 brush fires the 
forestry division has fought since monday with about 400 
firefighters said charles maynard the agencys spokesman in 
tallahassee 
were probably in better shape than we have been all week 
state forestry division spokesman jim whitson said wednesday it 
looks like weve got some moisture coming into the state right now 
the everglades fire finally stalled at a canal near the 
browardpalm beach county line after firefighters set backfires with 
incendiary bombs dropped from a helicopter 
their strategy managed to keep a 10milelong wall of flame away 
from power lines serving more than 3 million south florida 
residents in 1985 an everglades fire that burned more than 100000 
acres engulfed power lines and caused massive blackouts in south 
florida 
we got it out with a little help from mother nature 
deangelis said some of our boys suffered exhaustion from working 
the fire so long but there were no serious injuries 
in central florida however two volunteer firefighters 
responding to a wildfire monday were killed when a tractortrailer 
slammed into their smokeshrouded fire truck 
the extent of last months hot dry weather became clear 
wednesday when the weather service released temperature and rainfall 
data

law and order minister adriaan 
vlok said today that 280 detainees more than a quarter of those 
being held without charge will be free by this weekend 
however vlok who arranged the releases over a twoweek period 
as part of an effort to end a widespread hunger strike said the 
government had no plans to lift the 32month state of emergency that 
allows indefinite detention without trial 
an antiapartheid newspaper new nation said today that more 
than 50 people had been detained in the two weeks since vloks 
pledge of largescale releases prompted most of the hunger strikers 
to suspend their fast 
hunger strikes continue at prisons in natal province the exact 
number of participants is not known but laywers say at least 18 
have been hospitalized 
vlok in a statement said although the release of detainees 
is an ongoing process i will not hesitate to take whatever steps 
necessary to prevent renewed violence and unrest 
the revolutionary climate is still very high he said the 
present state of emergency is still very necessary 
he cited continuing blackonblack factional violence in natal 
province instability at schools in the township of soweto and a 
persistent rent boycott by blacks in several townships 
vloks statement came a day after he conferred with anglican 
archbiship desmond tutu and other antiapartheid church leaders 
most of the clergymen had met with vlok on feb 16 at the height of 
the hunger strike and emerged to call for suspension of the protest 
because vlok had promised to free a substantial number of

they made headlines when they broke the 
law but now they write headlines in prison publications across the 
country 
we consider ourselves professionals said 33yearold robert 
taliaferro who edits the prison mirror at the minnesota 
correctional facility in stillwater as he serves a life sentence for 
murder 
the prison mirror recently was named best newspaper for 1988 
in the 25th annual american penal press contest sponsored by 
southern illinois universitycarbondale taliaferros paper won the 
title for the third consecutive year 
there is so much passion and intensity in corrections 
journalism said walter jaehnig journalism school director at 
siu he said the schools competition is the only penal press 
contest in the nation 
you can see it in their work ive been real impressed with 
what ive seen he said we feel its important to encourage 
journalism wherever you find it in high schools or prison or 
anywhere else 
vienna in progress the newspaper at the vienna correctional 
center in southern illinois captured second place in the prison 
press contest and the echo of the texas department of corrections 
in huntsville came in third 
i think it shows the world that certain inmates are capable of 
extracting the good from themselves said david patin editor of 
vienna in progress since october 
its an outlet here that lets them express themselves on a 
different level added patin 35 of chicago who is serving a 
fiveyear sentence for robbery 
here theres not much opportunity for intellectual exchange 
he said wednesday 
i would be very happy taliaferro told a reporter to send 
my guys out there and compete with any one of you guys 
both editors said their publications focus on the positive side 
of prison life including educational and vocational programs as 
well as on problems and issues in prison like aids neither editor 
has had formal journalistic training 
taliaferro said he looks for good aggressive writers for his 
fivemember staff people who can get information in a place known 
for its reticent residents 
he also said prison newspaper work has its perks like freedom to 
roam the institution 
john levesque publisher of the edwardsville intelligencer and 
judge of the best newspaper category said he reviewed about 30 
entries that ranged from good to dreadful 
there are some good writers in prison said levesque i was 
encouraged that these people are getting some worthwhile experience 
in prison 
the contest offers 10 other categories in addition to best 
newspaper including best magazine picture sports poetry 
editorial feature cartoon fiction art and news story 
but most importantly taliaferro and patin said prison 
publications give inmates an opportunity to learn a trade bettering 
their chances of getting a job after prison 
what it comes down to is a sense of pride said taliaferro 
speaking about the newspapers firstplace award some of these 
guys have not won anything in their lives its something 
progressive for once

drug abusers who are infected with the aids virus 
and tuberculosis bacteria should be treated with medicine to prevent 
fullblown tb says a study published today 
doctors have noticed a growing prevalence of tuberculosis in 
recent years among people at high risk of aids especially drug 
addicts 
in the study published in the new england journal of medicine 
the tb usually resulted from activation of lingering tuberculosis 
infections not new exposures to the bacteria in people who also 
are infected with the aids virus 
the doctors warned that besides being at risk of getting 
tuberculosis themselves aidsinfected addicts who carry the tb 
bacteria also may pass the germs to people they live with to health 
care workers and other people 
the aggressive identification and treatment of hivinfected 
intravenous drug users with latent tuberculous infection is 
therefore of both clinical and public health importance wrote dr 
peter a selwyn of montefiore medical center in new york 
people may carry either the aids virus or tuberculosis bacteria 
for many years without getting sick while most people with the aids 
virus eventually go on to get acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
people who carry the tuberculosis bacteria ordinarily have only 
about a 10 percent lifelong risk of getting tb 
hiv the aids viurus weakens the bodys defenses against 
disease the study suggests that it lowers resistance to the 
tuberculosis bacteria putting people at much higher risk of tb 
the study was conducted on 520 drug users who were in a methadone 
program when the study began 42 percent already were infected with 
hiv twentythree percent of those with hiv also carried tb bacteria 
as did 20 percent of those who were free of the aids virus 
during almost two years of followup active tuberculosis 
developed in eight of the aidsinfected people but in none of those 
who did not have hiv seven of the eight tb cases occurred in people 
who were already infected with tuberculosis bacteria before the 
study began 
the doctors noted that 13 people who carried hiv and tb bacteria 
were treated with the drug isoniazid and none of them went on to 
get active tuberculosis however seven of 36 people with both 
infections who did not take the medicine got tb 
the doctors said that the drug is now administered along with 
daily methadone doses at the clinic where the study was conducted

the lack of mental health care in the largest 
cambodian refugee camp in thailand is leading to violence and 
depression among its residents according to a report released today 
mental health needs are neglected and there is a total lack 
of capacity in the community to provide for their own members 
said dr richard mollica chairman of the world federation for 
mental health and coauthor of the report 
mollica the director of the indochinese psychiatry clinic at 
bostons st elizabeths hospital said levels of domestic violence 
and suicide are escalating 
the federation filed its report with the united nations 
representatives of the groups committee on refugees and migrants 
conducted a field survey from sept 26 to oct 6 1988 at a camp 
said to be representative of conditions in all refugee camps on the 
thailandcambodia border 
about 300000 people have lived in the camps since 350000 
cambodians fled their country during pol pots khmer rouge regime 
the camp studied is the largest with about 170000 people 
although medical and educational services at the camp have 
improved in recent years cultural norms have broken down to 
dangerous levels with the ultimate outcome a major disintegration 
of the khmer cambodian culture the report said 
the report said the residents have been subject to psychiatric 
disorders not only because of the refugee flight and subsequent 
arrival in the camps but because of the trauma of the vietnam war 
approximately 60000 people died in the us bombing of cambodia and 
about 1 million were killed during the khmer rouge regime from 1975 
to 1979 
the rate of suicide increased last year at the camp the report 
said more than 90 percent of attempts were by women ages 15 to 30 
usually using an overdose of medication 
one factor characteristic of the mentally ill is the tiing moong 
or dummy personality a state of psychological withdrawal 
fashioned by refugees from the brutal pol pot regime in order to 
survive 
refugees acted as if they were deaf dumb confused or stupid 
since many of those who had behaved intelligently or asked many 
questions in cambodia were usually tortured or executed 
while originally an act to appear submissive the mental health 
federation found that many khmer people especially children would 
maintain this attitude to mask depression 
unless their problems are adequately addressed they will 
become dysfunctional adults and eventually enormous economic and 
social burdens on their future communities the report said 
the report calls on the thai government internal organizations 
in the camp and the united nations to help deal with the mental 
health problem 
the federation recommended that technical assistance and training 
be provided by khmer mental health professionals and religious 
leaders to promote khmer selfmanagement but the intervention of 
administrators would probably diminish the effectiveness of the 
selfhelp initiatives the report said 
other recommendatons included an allencompassing mental health 
system 
our ultimate hope is that the environment in the camp will 
improve so that the khmer will be able to make a contribution to 
their own society mollica said now and when they are finally 
repatriated

the launch of discovery and its five 
astronauts has been delayed at least two days until march 11 because 
of a crushed electrical part on a main engine officials said 
the delay apparently will resolve a conflict that had been 
brewing when a classified military launching threatened to bump the 
shuttle from its march 9 target date 
the national aeronatics and space administration said wednesday 
that during a readiness test of discoverys three main engines a 
control mechanism on engine no 1 shut down prematurely the problem 
was traced to a crushed solenoid on a valve but its cause was not 
known immediately 
a replacement part was flown here and installed late wednesday 
officials said the installation and checkout of the new unit will 
mean a slip of at least two days in the launch 
shuttle managers scheduled the start of a twoday flight 
readiness review today it is to end friday with the selection of a 
firm launch date 
during five days in orbit discoverys astronauts are to deploy a 
large communications satellite and conduct scientific experiments 
on monday the air force informed nasa it had scheduled a 
critical military launch next week and that it would not be able to 
support a discovery liftoff until march 11 the space agency relies 
heavily on air force tracking facilities for a shuttle launch 
the military mission has launch priority for national security 
reasons but nasa said before the solenoid problem it was ready to 
negotiate the launch date with military officials 
the air force launch is believed to involve a satellite to test 
sensors for the strategic defense initiative the star wars missile 
defense shield another mission scheduled soon that also would have 
priority over the shuttle is the first firing of a trident 2 
intercontinental range missile from a submerged submarine

the state has agreed to settle the 
largest desegregation case in its history by paying out 118 
million including naacp attorneys fees dating back to the landmark 
courtordered integration of 1957 
the proposed settlement which ends six years of litigation 
involving the state and the three school districts in pulaski 
county was signed by attorneys for all the parties before us 
district judge henry woods on wednesday 
we knew that we were going to have to pay a sizable amount of 
money and i think all things considered this is the best possible 
deal the state could have gotten state education director ruth 
steele said 
the little rock school district which is mostly black had sued 
the state and the neighboring mostly white north little rock and 
pulaski county school districts in federal court alleging the 
defendants caused illegal segregation in little rock schools 
woods found north little rock and pulaski county liable and 
ordered the districts merged but the 8th us circuit court of 
appeals while affirming woods liability ruling said his proposed 
countywide consolidation was too severe 
instead the appeals court ordered the boundary line between the 
little rock and pulaski county districts redrawn moving large 
mostly white sections of the city of little rock which were in the 
county district into the city district north little rock was not 
affected 
the appeals court then asked the district judge to consider how 
much the state would have to pay for compensatory education programs 
in the three districts including magnet schools in little rock 
the agreement calls for the payment of 59 million to the little 
rock district 197 million to the pulaski county district and 27 
million to the north little rock district for compensatory programs 
among other payments the state would make is 31 million in 
attorneys fees for the legal defense fund of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people for work going 
back to 1956 involving the original little rock desegregation case 
and the 1957 school crisis 
in 1957 enforcing a landmark supreme court decision president 
eisenhower sent federal troops into little rock to protect the 
courtordered rights of nine black students to attend the otherwise 
allwhite central high school 
if wednesdays agreement is approved by woods the state would be 
released as a defendant in the case final approval is needed from 
woods all three school boards the legislature and the state board 
of education no hearing was set 
the little rock school board quickly became the first public 
group to approve the settlement 
the settlement is more than just dollars its many concepts 
and successful programs that will work when implemented correctly 
school board president robin armstrong said 
the payments would total 118 million over the next decade the 
most in a desegregation case in the states history 
a bill filed in the legislature wednesday would add a 5 percent 
surcharge on the income taxes of residents of pulaski county to 
defray the desegregation costs

the federal environmental protection agency 
intends to monitor south carolinas ban on hazardous wastes from 32 
states and puerto rico to determine its effects on the states own 
hazardous waste program 
greer tidwell the epas southeastern administrator said the 
agency is concerned about the states action and urged eight 
other states in the region to look at cooperative efforts in 
handling hazardous waste 
the epa can take away any states authority to handle its own 
hazardous waste program if it is removed all related permits for 
that state would have to be issued by the regional office and 
accompanying federal money could be reduced epa spokesman carl 
terry said 
terrys comments came as south carolina began its ban on 
hazardous wastes and two of the most affected states florida and 
north carolina tried to regain access to the states privately 
owned landfill 
ten extra inspectors stood ready at the landfill to turn back 
loads from banned states wednesday but all of the 25 trucks came 
from approved states state health department spokesman bill culler 
said 
it looks like the word got around and there havent been a 
whole lot of problems culler said 
state department of health and environmental control officials 
announced tuesday that only 17 states plus south carolina and the 
district of columbia would be allowed to continue disposing 
hazardous waste in the state as a result of gov carroll campbells 
executive order of jan 18 
campbell announced that south carolina would prohibit beginning 
wednesday the disposal of waste from any state that refused to 
dispose of the waste itself he said it was meant to encourage other 
states to locate disposal sites within their own borders rather than 
relying on south carolina 
in a statement wednesday the epas tidwell said the agency 
will monitor the situation closely to determine what effect the 
states action as a result of that executive order may or may not 
have on its authorized hazardous waste program 
the ban affects the gsx services landfill on the shore of lake 
marion in sumter county near pinewood the site annually accepts 
135000 tons of hazardous waste such as solvents acids and other 
chemical garbage about 70 percent of the waste comes from out of 
state 
the gsx site is one of only two commercial hazardous waste 
landfills in the southeast the other is in emelle ala 
the head of floridas department of environmental regulation 
dale twachtmann has written south carolina officials asking them to 
reconsider the decision according to raoul clarke a department 
administrator 
we do recognize that we generate hazardous wastes and we cant 
rely on the other states clarke said 
north carolina gov jim martin said he also sent campbell a 
letter wednesday advising him of pending state legislation that 
would repeal north carolinas ban on a hazardous waste landfill 
until a hazardous waste treatment plant could be built 
martin said he could understand campbells irritation with other 
states inaction on hazardous wastes 
would we have been that tolerant had other states been shipping 
their hazardous wastes here martin asked i doubt it we 
probably would have run out of patience sooner

romanias embassy declined comment today 
on a newspaper report suggesting the east bloc country is secretly 
trying to sell off western shipments of humanitarian food aid for 
hard currency 
neue zuercher zeitung a conservative zurich newspaper reported 
it received a letter and copies of documents from romania 
indicating the state foreign trade agency in bucharest offered ally 
north korea a discounted shipment of 18 staple goods under false 
pretenses for payment in us dollars 
the sender accuses romanian authorities of seizing western aid 
shipments for the starving freezing population and bartering them 
away for hard currency the newspaper said tuesday in a 
correspondents report from copenhagen denmark the sender was not 
identified 
an official at the romanian embassy in bern said he had not seen 
the story and could not comment 
im not aware of a problem said the official who declined 
to give his name the embassy concerns itself with other 
questions 
the newspaper said one document was a fake bill from a danish 
mail order company to the romanian embassy in bonn west germany 
for an alleged shipment worth about 66000 
the fake dated dec 21 listed 18 items including cooking oil 
spaghetti rice flour yeast sugar honey milk powder butter and 
margarine 
in the second document dated jan 19 the romanian state foreign 
trade company refers to the purported danish bill and offers the 
same goods to north korea at a 40 percent discount 
it says a hard currency shortage forced the embassy to resell its 
order at a loss according to the paper 
the two documents raise the suspicion that the ceausescu regime 
is depriving its suffering population of aid shipments from western 
humanitarian organizations and tries to sell them to friendly 
foreign countries at deep discounts but for hard currency neue 
zuercher zeitung said 
president nicolae ceausescus is the most repressive government 
in the soviet bloc and his attempt to rid romania of foreign debt 
has left the country financially strapped food and power shortages 
are commonplace

solidarity leader lech walesa and his 
senior advisers met a government team led by interior minister gen 
czeslaw kiszczak today in an apparent bid to overcome obstacles 
after nearly a month of talks 
government spokesman pawel byra said the meeting at the secluded 
magdalenka residence in a forest south of the capital was of a 
working character it is no extraordinary meeting 
state radio said a communique would be issued after the meeting 
walesa smiled at reporters but declined to answer questions as he 
left for the meeting he has over the past few weeks been traveling 
the country pleading with people to hold back protests and give the 
talks more time to succeed 
the unprecedented roundtable talks on seeking a way out of 
political and economic turmoil began feb 6 with the banned 
solidarity free trade union movement seeking first and foremost to 
have its legal status restored 
the government said it is willing to legalize solidarity if a 
broad agreement is reached on economic and political reforms and on 
opposition participation in parliament 
but several sticking points have arisen including the form of 
elections to parliament 
solidarity has accepted the principle that a majority of seats 
would be reserved for the ruling communist party and its allies but 
wants the rest freely contested 
another sore point is the banned independent students association 
students have become increasingly restive about the fate of the 
organization known by the polish initials nzs especially after 
signs that solidarity and the farmers rural solidarity would be 
legalized 
communist authorities apparently regard the independent students 
association as more of a threat but walesa has defended the 
organization 
no table can stand on less than three legs and those three 
legs are solidarity of workers nzs and rural solidarity he has 
said 
the independent students association was banned along with 
solidarity and other independent groups after the dec 13 1981 
martiallaw crackdown 
the government and opposition also remain far apart on creating a 
state presidency that would help guarantee continuation of a 
communist system in poland on the degree of oppositions access to 
the mass media and on the framework for an economic reform program 
the meetings have occurred as economic unrest continues over 
workers declining wages high inflation and the 39 billion foreign 
debt 
walesa was accompanied to the meeting by a platoon of advisers 
including historian bronislaw geremek journalist tadeusz 
mazowiecki union organizers zbigniew bujak and wladyslaw frasyniuk 
roman catholic church spokesman the rev alojzy orszulik and gdansk 
bishop tadeusz goclowski

aetna life insurance co the fund administrator 
families getting checks from wednesdays mailing may get an 
additional check later afer the total number of eligible applicants

one year after smoking was outlawed in 
the josephine county jail the inmates are fuming but the jailers 
are smiling 
jail commander mark dickson said inmates are fighting less and 
are much healthier since cigarettes jailhouse currency for 
generations were taken away 
in fact i have had far more inmates come up to me since this 
was issued and thank us for the policy because it forced them to 
quit smoking dickson said tuesday 
inmate ron wise wasnt one of them 
its unconstitutional deprivation in my way of thinking he 
said the sheriff has taken it upon himself to decide whats good 
for us 
dickson said the jail was the first in oregon to outlaw tobacco 
but others have followed suit he estimated 95 percent of the 
inmates smoked when they entered jail 
inmates found smuggling in tobacco arent punished the goods are 
merely confiscated dickson said 
blackened electrical outlets are evidence that some cigarettes 
are getting in inmates who can find something to smoke but dont 
have matches put a paper clip in the outlet then draw a spark with 
another paper clip dickson said 
one inmate was so desparate for a smoke he rolled herbal tea in 
toilet paper and lit up the commander said 
with cigarettes out of the way the jail is cutting back on 
caffeine coffee with caffeine is no longer available at lunch and 
will soon be gone from the dinner table 
i think we have an obligation to maintain the healthiest 
environment possible dickson said

some of the miami areas biggest employers are 
making the fight against drugs their business 
fiftyfive corporations and public employers accounting for 16 
percent of metropolitan miamis work force have joined in a campaign 
to administer urine tests to job applicants and to current workers 
suspected of drug use 
this campaign will tell those entering the work force that if 
you use illegal drugs dont bother applying for a job here ted 
hoepner chairman of sunbankmiami said wednesday at the same 
time it offers help to those who may have a problem 
business against drugs could be the biggest program of its kind 
in the country hoepner said the companies involved represent 
137000 employees 
the program sponsored by the greater miami chamber of commerce 
calls for drug screening as a prerequisite for employment testing 
of employees suspected of drug use and assistance to workers found 
to have substanceabuse problems 
workers who fail to respond to the assistance programs would face 
probable loss of their jobs hoepner said 
among the employers involved are burger king corp knightridder 
inc the university of miami and dade county public schools 
charter members of the chamber can take part in an employee 
assistance plan for 1850 per worker annually and receive a reduced 
group rate for the urine tests 
the most effective means of controlling something bad is a 
forceful move something that will create fear in the person said

south koreas first lady today sent 
money to a griefstricken family whose four girls took rat poison so 
their parents would have enough money to send their brother to 
school 
the girls aged 6 to 13 were found unconscious monday the 
youngest girl died immediately police said the others were in 
critical condition today 
korean newspapers gave the story prominent display and 
editorials on the childrens plight criticized public policies that 
some said do too little for the young or the poor editorials also 
blamed a maledominated social structure that often leads to 
discrimination against girls and women 
the sad story touched the man in the street wrote the korea 
times 
police said the eldest of the four girls soonmi told 
authorities the children made a suicide pact to ease their parents 
financial burden and leave enough money for the education of their 
3yearold brother 
money for schooling has traditionally been provided first to boys 
the father yang taebun 44 is a factory worker who supports 
the family on the equivalent of 362 a month police said 
the story led to an outpouring of sympathy led by first lady kim 
oksook wife of president roh taewoo she sent the family 
condolences and an undisclosed amount of money officials said 
opposition politician kim daejung visited the girls parents at 
the hospital i am griefstricken i feel a great burden as a 
politician and i will focus on ways to promote the livelilhood of 
alienated people he said 
kim jongpil head of the new democratic republican party 
attributed the suicide attempt to the faults of politicians who 
have failed to hammer out appropriate steps for a balanced income 
distribution 
seoul newspapers quoted the girls teachers as saying they 
studied hard and were quiet model students 
a neighborhood shopkeeper said soonmi told him she could not 
afford 580 worth of notebooks and pencils for school and asked to 
pay later 
the korea times quoted a composition written by soonmi that said 
on christmas eve they rang the bell the helping neighbor 
campaign i searched my pocket and found a 500 won coin worth 74 
cents i was supposed to buy school things with this money but i 
put it into the charity pot hoping that the money would be used for

the government today rejected an iranian proposal 
to discuss the controversy over the satanic verses saying there 
is nothing to talk about until iran renounces violence 
news reports said a television newsman was being guarded after 
threats from an anonymous caller who accused him of insulting 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
an iranian newspaper called for a worldwide day of disgust so 
moslems can demonstrate their hatred against the enemies of 
islam 
an arab writer who last year won the nobel prize for literature 
urged moslem countries to condemn khomeinis death sentence against 
author salman rushdie but also proposed publishers of the satanic 
verses be boycotted 
the soviet news agency tass suggested khomeini may have had no 
choice under the law of islam but to denounce rushdie 
a spokesman for britains foreign office said there were 
telephone calls at an official level wednesday and again today 
proposing a meeting in geneva 
the foreign office did not identify its iranian contact but bbc 
television said it understood the contact was mohammad mehdi akhoond 
zadeh basti who until this week was irans topranking diplomat in 
london 
we saw no merit to a meeting at this stage said the foreign 
office spokesman who demanded anonymity the first step must be 
for iran to renounce violence 
khomeini sentenced rushdie to death feb 14 for his novel which 
some say insults islam rushdie a briton who was born into a moslem 
family in india apologized for distress the book caused but 
khomeini rejected the apology 
iranian leaders have offered a 52 million bounty for rushdie 
who since feb 14 has been in hiding and reportedly under police 
guard 
news reports said channel four newsman peter sissons was also 
under guard after a man claiming to represent a proiranian group 
guardians of the islamic revolution threatened him 
the anonymous caller telephoned news agencies in london last week 
claiming sissons insulted khomeini in a program friday peter 
sissons of channel four will pay the price of insulting the imam 
khomeini the caller said 
during the program sissons interviewed basti and asked do you 
understand that we dont regard it as civilized to kill people for 
their opinions do you understand that people in this country fought 
a world war to protect themselves and others from being murdered for 
their beliefs 
more than a dozen european countries have recalled ambassadors 
from tehran in response to khomeinis threat and some including 
west germany have cut back on their commercial dealings with iran 
tass suggested such treatment was too harsh 
any acts of violence or calls for it obviously arouse 
indignation at the same time one cannot fail to notice that the 
world press has been presenting the conflict in black and white 
terms as iran having thrown down a gauntlet to the west 
wednesdays commentary said 
but perhaps imam khomeini the supreme religious authority in 
iran had no choice proceeding from koran teachings other than 
denouncing a man who has insulted islam 
last week foreign minister eduard shevardnadze met with khomeini 
in tehran in a bid to improve relations with iran in addition the 
soviet union has a large population of moslems 
the iranian newspaper jomhuri islam today said it is important 
that moslems keep the initiative in the dispute over the satanic 
verses it described khomeinis death order has a a brave and 
timely blow that had disturbed the balance of the west 
in cairo nobel laureate naguib mahfouz said he believed khomeini 
had harmed islam and moslems with the death order 
but he also said he supports boycott or confiscation of the book 
for the sake of social peace and on condition this not be used as 
a pretext to suppress thought his commentary appeared in the 
stateowned newspaper alahram 
in another development switzerlands ringier media concern said 
it gave three months notice to ahmed huber a wellknown swiss 
journalist and convert to islam the berner zeitung newspaper on 
feb 17 quoted huber as saying he supports the death sentence 
for rushdie because there can be no other punishment for this 
blasphemy based on selfishness and profiteering 
huber made similar statements in a television interview

the soviet union has formed another 
commission to determine whether thousands of bodies found in a mass 
grave outside this ukrainian village were killed by the nazis or 
josef stalins secret police 
three previous soviet investigations have blamed german forces 
who occupied the area from 194143 but elderly residents of this 
village near kiev recently broke 50 years of silence on the matter 
they blamed their government for the bodies up to 300000 by one 
unofficial estimate buried in the forest 
one witness petro z kukovenko says he summoned the courage to 
speak after a soviet commission reburied the bones and erected a 
memorial in may blaming the nazis for the killing 
when they put up this monument i became ashamed that they were 
blaming this on the wrong people said kukovenko 74 
my father may be buried there said kukovenkos wife halyna 
my father was a collective farmer and they killed him for 
nothing she sobbed 
western historians estimate 20 million soviets were killed under 
stalin particularly during the great purge of the late 1930s 
but it was only in 1987 the soviet government as part of the 
reforms instituted under president mikhail s gorbachev began to 
admit that stalin was responsible for even thousands of deaths 
mikola g lysenko a retired economist is crusading to end what 
he considers a conspiracy of lies in december he succeeded in 
forcing the government to form a fourth commission to find the 
murderers 
lysenko said that 50 villagers say the bodies were killed before 
the german occupation 
all four commissions have involved officials with connections to 
the secret police lysenko said 
kukovenko lived through that terrible time from 1936 to 1941 
when canvascovered trucks hauled their mysterious cargo to the 
greenfenced compound in the darnitsia forest 
he first saw the horror when a german officer forced him and four 
other men to exhume one of the graves just four days after nazi 
troops occupied the area in september 1941 
i know that this pit we dug up was a fresh grave maybe the 
people had been buried there a week earlier just before the red 
army retreated kukovenko said since that time further excavation 
has found the remains of thousands of soviets in the pits stacked 
like canned sardines 
government estimates range from 6000 to 68000 bodies but 
lysenko said there are five to eight victims in every two square 
yards of the 80000squareyard site that amounts to 200000 to 
300000 people 
the first government investigation of bykovnia was conducted by a 
war crimes commission in 1944 lysenko said stalin was alive 
then and any talk that these were crimes of stalins men was out of 
the question he said 
in 1971 a second government commission was named to investgate 
the deaths but kukovenko said he was afraid to go there and tell 
them 
lysenko discovered bykovnia in may 1987 by autumn he had 
gathered 10 witnesses to the massacre with support from the 
ukrainian writers union he wrote to the city of kiev and the 
communist party within days a third commission was formed 
the kgb went to the witnesses i mentioned in my letter people 
became afraid and said no i didnt see it lysenko says 
on may 6 1988 the government erected a monument to 6329 
soviets killed by the fascist occupiers in 194143 
i thought did i make a mistake said lysenko so i went 
back and found 20 other people and they all said it happened 
before the war 
in december he took witnesses to testify before the writers 
union the next day the fourth commission was formed 
but col gen ivan hladush the ukrainian minister of interior 
is still the chairman oles shevchenko head of the helsinki watch 
group in the ukraine believes hladush has covered up the crimes of 
his predecessors 
attempts to reach the ukrainian ministry of internal affairs were 
unsuccessful 
kukovenko says hes offended by constant references to the 
myth that stalins secret police killed the victims at bykovnia 
am i a myth are my friends a myth he asks

the two busiest airlines at ohare international 
airport began an experiment today in staggering their flight 
arrivals in hopes of reducing delays and congestion at the nations 
busiest airfield 
the federal aviation administration had prodded united airlines 
which runs the most flights out of ohare and american airlines 
into working out a solution 
under the agreement neither airline will schedule more than 
three arrivals during a twominute period and more than seven 
arrivals in a fiveminute period said united spokeswoman sara 
dornacker 
ms dornacker said she did not know how many flights had 
previously been crammed into those time periods 
in most cases schedule changes of five minutes or less are 
involved in the experiment 
united will still have 396 arrivals and departures daily at 
ohare 240 united flights will be affected by the agreement 
dornacker said 
nearly 37 percent of united arrivals at ohare were delayed in 
december the latest month for which figures were available said 
dornacker 
figures from american were not immediately available american 
officials did not return telephone calls 
the agreement worked out in december as a twoyear experiment 
also forbids either airline from increasing daily arrivals between 
715 am and 1044 am and between 415 pm and 844 pm the 
united spokeswoman said 
the purpose of these actions is to reduce the delays now 
occuring at ohare she said its one step in a program and we 
feel as a company that more work is needed to solve the chicago 
areas congestion problem

four of the five original members of the 
jefferson airplane are reuniting 17 years after it disbanded a 
publicist says 
grace slick paul kantner jorma kaukonen and jack casady are 
in the process of signing a major record contract said mitchell 
schneider 
marty balin who left the band after the volunteers album was 
released in 1969 is not part of the agreement according to a 
statement but it added no doors are closed 
the jefferson airplane was formed by balin and kantner who added 
slick as the vocalist after original lead singer signe anderson left 
because of pregnancy the groups second album surrealistic 
pillow was the first to feature slick 
she brought with her two songs from her former band white 
rabbit and somebody to love that became the quintessential 
haightashbury sound during san franciscos summer of love in 1967 
other albums included after bathing at baxters crown of 
creation bless its pointed little head volunteers 
bark and long john silver 
in the early 1970s kaukonen and casady formed the acoustic blues 
band hot tuna a side job that eventually removed them from the 
airplane slick and kantner did several projects together and in 
1974 formed jefferson starship 
it was loose it wasnt planned slick said about the 
reformation she said kantner recently had been doing some shows 
with hot tuna and she was asked to sing a few songs at the fillmore 
in san francisco 
the reaction was more striking than we planned so we thought 
wed make a record she said the band will begin recording an 
album of new material in the coming weeks produced by ron nevison 
kantners departure from the jefferson starship in 1984 led to a 
bitter legal battle with slick over money and the bands name a 
settlement in 1987 gave the band the right to use only the latter 
part of the name starship and gave kantner 250000 
kantner and slick once lived together and the two have a daughter

immigration agents will not single out 
hispaniclooking people to see if they are illegal aliens under a 
settlement reached in federal court 
the settlement tuesday ended part of a lawsuit brought by 
hispanics who accused agents of routinely stopping them on the basis 
of their appearance 
the immigration and naturalization service also agreed to make 
payments of 1000 to about 3000 to six people who were stopped by 
agents the largest amount will go to robert mireles of eau claire 
who was stopped three times 
in settling the suit the government admitted no wrongdoing said 
edwin w earl chief patrol agent for the ins in michigan 
the settlement applies only to the federal court district 
covering the western half of michigans lower peninsula and all of 
the upper peninsula 
the classaction suit filed in 1981 alleged that immigration 
workers unfairly targeted the 50000 to 100000 hispanics in 
southwestern michigan with traffic stops interrogations handcuffs 
and nighttime household searches 
youre driving to the store or to get a haircut and youre 
stopped by marked cars said philip riley an attorney the 
plaintiffs for migrant workers its embarrassing 
many of the migrant workers stopped were residents of california 
and texas who were in the state for seasonal work riley said 
us district judge richard enslen said the ins appeared to be 
violating a constitutional ban on unlawful search and seizure 
earl said today that the government promised not to stop cars of 
suspected aliens based on appearance alone but that was never 
done anyway we always have other reasons for stopping vehicles that 
we stop he declined to be specific 
the government agreed to a settlement to prevent the suit from 
dragging out and to save the cost of defending it he said 
the settlement requires the ins to keep detailed written records 
of any traffic stops earl said ins agents would begin doing that 
across michigan but he didnt know if it would be done in other 
states 
the agreement bars border agents from stopping vehicles 
containing people of hispanic origin or appearance at places other 
than border checkpoints or more than 25 miles from the border 
without a search warrant or without reason to suspect that a person 
in the vehicle is an illegal alien 
another part of the suit in which several plaintiffs allege they 
were roused from their beds and illegally searched at migrant camps 
may go to trial in july when the plaintiffs return to michigan to 
work

a threatened strike by eastern airlines machinists 
this weekend has sent travelers scrambling for other carriers and 
eastern warned a sympathy walkout by pilots could bury the company 
in the corporate graveyard 
ticket agents reported a surge in sales at eastern competitors as 
a strike appeared increasingly likely at the miamibased airline 
which carries an average of 100000 passengers a day and says it is 
losing 1 million daily 
eastern wants to cut salaries to save 150 million the 
machinists union representing 8500 eastern baggage handlers and 
other ground services workers wants 50 million in salary increases 
company chairman frank lorenzo in a videotape sent wednesday to 
the pilots union warned that if the pilots and other employees 
support the machinists picket line and dont show up for work 
eastern cannot survive 
im afraid eastern is going to go through this juncture and 
perhaps end up in the corporate graveyard said lorenzo the 
chairman of texas air easterns parent company 
easterns rivals also have been mapping strategy to keep 
operating in the event of a secondary boycott by the machinists 
union which has asked a federal court judge in washington to allow 
its members to picket other airlines ships and other modes of 
transportation 
while most airlines arent commenting on contingency plans in the 
event of an industrywide strike some of easterns fiercest 
competitors are moving to cash in on the passenger spillover 
pan american corp which vies with eastern in the lucrative east 
coast shuttle routes already has said it would double its flights 
linking new york to boston and washington during a strike 
and delta said it can handle easterns surplus to florida and 
puerto rico without putting more planes in the air 
nonunion continental airlines also owned by texas air has 
downplayed the effect of a strike at eastern despite vows by 
machinists union members to close it down as well 
we are two totally separate carriers said continental 
spokesman ned walker in houston we do not expect any impact at 
continental from the eastern situation there will be no service 
disruption whatsoever 
eastern says it is doomed unless its pilots continue flying 
during a strike set to begin at 1201 am est saturday unless an 
agreement is reached in the machinists 17monthold contract 
dispute 
lorenzos videotaped message offered pilots sweeter pay raises 
and job security but leaders of the pilots and flight attendants 
unions have urged members to honor picket lines 
lorenzo who bought eastern in 1986 earned a unionbusting 
reputation when he broke labor contracts with continentals workers 
after taking that airline into bankruptcy reorganization in 1983 
the 3500member pilots union said the new offer does not 
guarantee job security contains 64 million in pilot concessions 
and would require the union to drop lawsuits and grievances worth 
250 million 
in his videotape mr lorenzo made a fine theatrical 
performance the pilots executive council said in a statement to 
its members dont be misled much work still needs to be done 
the machinists also appealed for solidarity in the days before 
the strike 
we would hope the pilots would remember that lorenzo has made 
agreements before and contracts mean nothing to him hes not to be 
trusted said frank ortis vice president of the machinists miami 
local 
the white house meanwhile is giving no hint of whether 
president bush will meet the request of federal mediators and stop a 
strike white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush will 
make his decision on whether to step in before the midnight friday 
deadline 
as to a proposal to stop the strike for 60 days no decision 
has been made fitzwater said today 
eastern ran fullpage advertisements in some newspapers today 
quoting editorials across the country that urge bush not to call in 
federal mediators 
eastern has promised passengers full refunds or seats on other 
airlines at no extra cost if flights are canceled but several 
competitors remain wary of accepting tickets a bankrupt eastern 
might not be able to pay for

wild animal park says 
the egg was examined wednesday under a highintensity lamp by the 
parks lead condor keeper don sterner said park spokesman tom 
hanscom 
he will leave the egg in the incubator for two more days in the

at this point we dont believe the egg to be fertile 
the egg was among three laid at two southern california zoos 
since feb 20 in a program to save the endangered species one of 
the eggs was previously declared infertile a second egg is expected 
to hatch between april 17 and 21 
all 28 of the california condors known to be alive are in 
captivity half at the los angeles zoo and half at the san diego 
park 
scientists hope to breed enough of the condors north americas 
largest land birds to reintroduce the vulturelike species to the 
wild 
the fertile egg was produced by the same breeding couple that 
gave birth last april to the first condor conceived and hatched in 
captivity molloko

surgeons put a 20yearold female gorilla under the 
knife to repair a grapefruitsized hernia that could have been life 
threatening 
it went better than anybody could have hoped for zoo 
veterinarian richard cambre said after the twohour operation 
wednesday surgeons are confident this will heal well and she 
wont have any recurrence of the hernia 
a team of doctors led by veterinary surgeon robert taylor 
performed the operation on the anesthetized 214pound lowland 
gorilla bibi surgeons stitched goretex the material that keeps 
skiers warm around the herniated area 
the goretex will act as a latticework for new fibrous tissue to 
grow through and will give a lot of strength to the area cambre 
said 
by early wednesday afternoon bibi was awake and hungry but it 
will be a month before the animal gets to rejoin her fellow 
gorillas veterinarians dont want to take the chance that some 
rough gorillaplay will rip out her stitches 
the hernia was discovered during an operation for colon disease 
in 1986 doctors removed part of the gorillas intestines at the 
time but feared the risk of infection was too high to repair the 
hernia

israeli paratroopers patrolling southern lebanon 
shot and killed four palestinian guerrillas today who were en route 
to attack targets in israel the army said 
a fifth guerrilla escaped and troops were searching the area 
said a military source speaking on condition of anonymity 
no israeli troops were injured an army spokesman said 
the clash occurred about three miles north of the 
israelilebanese border in the western sector of israels 
selfproclaimed security zone said the spokesman who cannot be 
identified under military regulations 
this was definitely an infiltration attempt he said 
the spokesman said documents found on the bodies of the 
guerrillas identified them as members of the democratic front for 
the liberation of palestine a radical marxist faction of the plo 
a security source in lebanon said the clash occurred in the 
israelicontrolled security zone near the lebanese village of al 
jibbayn 
it was the second infiltration attempt attributed to the 
democratic front since feb 23 when israeli soldiers killed three 
palestinian guerrillas in the six to 10milewide buffer zone 
israel created the security zone in 1985 when it pulled the bulk of 
its forces out of lebanon after a threeyear occupation 
israel radio said the guerrillas killed today were armed with 
sovietmade kalashnikov assault guns grenades and missiles 
maj gen yossi peled head of the armys northern command said 
leaflets were also found in the possession of the guerrillas 
the leaflet speaks of carrying out a hostagetaking mission in 
israel peled said on israel radio it speaks of military action 
to support the political activities of the plo leadership 
earlier today the foreign ministry gave reporters photocopies of 
two democratic front identification cards it said belonged to two of 
the three guerrillas killed feb 23 a ministry spokesman who is by 
tradition not identified noted that the democratic front is a full 
member of the plo 
israel has tried to persuade the united states to end a dialogue 
it began with the plo after its chief yasser arafat said in 
december that he recognized israels right to exist and renounced 
terrorism 
prime minister yitzhak shamir who maintains the plo will never 
give up terrorism said in an interview published wednesday that the 
us talks with the plo are useless 
on tuesday us officials met with plo representatives in tunis 
where the organization has its headquarters and asked them to put 
an end to all attempts by its guerrillas to infiltrate israel 
but the state department also criticized an israeli retaliatory 
air raid on tuesday against a democratic front post in lebanon 
southeast of beirut 
on wednesday a state department spokesman charles redman said 
the us talks with the plo will continue despite israels pleas

seventyfive vietnamese who fled their communist 
homeland in search of a better life returned to vietnam in a 
chartered jet today in the first largescale repatriation of boat 
people 
the boat people were among about 11000 vietnamese who have 
sailed into this british colony since it adopted a tough new policy 
last year that for most of them rules out resettlement 
many of the boat people waved and smiled as they boarded the hong 
kong dragon airlines boeing 737 jet but some appeared 
apprehensive a few carried cassette tape recorders others were 
emptyhanded 
the 46 men 19 women and 10 children were accompanied by two un 
officials and an interpreter on the 2hour flight to hanoi 
when they touched down in hanoi they were met by vietnamese 
un and british officials hong kong radio reported 
the boat people were to be briefed and taken to a transit camp 
about six miles from hanoi airport the radio said 
this is an important start security branch official michael 
hanson told reporters in hong kong 
the hong kong government hopes the successful repatriation of the 
first group will convince other boat people to return home from the 
colonys crowded camps now bulging with nearly 26000 vietnamese 
the repatriation was arranged under an agreement reached by 
vietnam and the un high commissioner for refugees hanoi promised 
not to prosecute its returning citizens and to allow the 
international organization to monitor their treatment back home 
the unhcr agreed to provide assistance to the repatriated 
vietnamese returning adults received 50 and their children 25 
according to un officials and other unspecified assistance will 
be offered 
the un agency which has offices in vietnam has vowed to 
closely monitor the fate of boat people who return home 
i would tend to say if too many of them get into trouble it 
will be known alexander casella one of the two un officials on 
the flight said wednesday he was expected to remain in vietnam one 
week and accompany the boat people to home villages after their 
brief stay in hanoi 
vietnamese have sailed by the tens of thousands to ports of 
asylum in noncommunist southeast asia since the vietnam war ended 
in 1975 but only a handful had previously asked to go back 
this british colony about 500 miles north of vietnam long 
classified all arriving vietnamese as refugees who could stay in the 
colony until resettled elsewhere less than two dozen of the more 
than 120000 vietnamese who have come to hong kong returned home 
between 1979 and 1988 
but to stem the growing influx of boat people the colony adopted 
a new policy effective last june under which vietnamese are 
considered refugees only if they can prove they fled their homeland 
because of persecution 
the vast majority do not meet that standard under a government 
screening program and are classified as illegal immigrants hong 
kong wants to forcibly send them home but hanoi insists it will 
only accept those who want to return 
vietnam originally approved repatriation applications from 145 
boat people in hong kong but when hanoi officials arrived in the 
colony to issue travel documents last month only 81 still wanted to 
go home 
six backed out at the last minute 
despite the harsh new policy boat people continue to sail to the 
colony with 356 arriving last month up from 114 for january and 91 
in february 1988 
meanwhile resettlement of the approximately 15000 vietnamese in 
hong kong camps granted refugee status received a recent boost with 
several countries including the united states agreeing to increase 
the number they accept 
officials believe 4000 refugees may be resettled this year from 
hong kong up from 2772 last year and 2212 in 1987

the chilean navy today floated a ring 
of booms around a grounded peruvian ship in an effort to contain an 
oil spill that has created a slick more than a halfmile long in the 
antarctic a spokesman said 
the navy spokesman lt cristian carbone said in a telephone 
interview that our priority task at this point is to contain the 
spill 
floating the humboldt comes next said carbone who was in 
punta arenas 1500 miles south of santiago 
he said divers plunged into the frigid waters to evaluate the 
damage to the humboldts oil tanks and begin sealing them 
frogmen from nearby uruguayan and south korean antarctic stations 
also are participating in the operation according to a navy 
communique 
the 1980ton humboldt ran aground shortly before midnight sunday 
at the entrance of marion cove on king george island all 64 
scientists and sailors aboard were rescued by the british royal 
navys ice patrol ship endurance 
on wednesday however a group of sailors were back on the ship 
to start planning the operation to float it and await for the 
arrival of the chilian cutter yelcho to coordinate the cleanup the 
yelcho arrived today 
carbone said the barrier installed around the humboldt is the 
same type used successfully a month ago to contain a mayor oil spill 
caused by the bahia paraiso an argentine navy vessel that run 
aground off the antarctic peninsula 
the oil slick created by the humboldt had grown to more than a 
halfmile long and 150 feet wide by wednesday afternoon more than 
double its size of a day earlier according to the chilean navy 
peruvian officials however claimed the spill is minimal 
carbone stressed that the priority was to clean up the spill and 
then try to float the ship 
the floating operation will be undertaken earlier only if 
experts consider it is necessary to contain the oil spill he said 
the navy said the damage sustained by the humboldt which is 
stable sitting on rocks and sand does not seem serious and 
officials are confident they will be able to float it soon 
winds up to 80 mph on wednesday prevented efforts to right the 
humboldt and clean up the diesel oil leaking from two fuel tanks 
the navy said

a b52 bomber flew over northern canada 
today in a test of the first us cruise missile containing the new 
stealth technology 
the missile was to remain attached to the b52 in what is called 
a captivecarry test flights where the missile remains attached to 
the aircraft are used to check guidance systems 
as far as we know everything is proceeding well said maj 
jan martinsen at the cold lake base in northeastern alberta near 
the tests target site the aircraft was to return to the united 
states later today 
the b52 headed north from edwards air force base in california 
late wednesday the test had been scheduled for wednesday morning 
but was delayed for 24 hours because of weather problems 
the decision to allow testing of the advanced cruise in canada 
drew protests from peace groups 
they said the missile equipped with stealth technology so it can 
better avoid detection is an offensive weapon that will fuel the 
arms race and ultimately create a need for a costly and complex 
canadian air defence system 
the canadian and us governments have said the weapon is too 
slow to be a firststrike offensive weapon 
the stealth cruise is an improved version of the airlaunched 
missiles that have been tested over northern canada for several 
years in addition to stealth technology it also has increased range 
and better accuracy 
cruise testing in canada is carried out under an agreement first 
signed with the united states in 1983 and renewed last year

congress celebrated the 200th anniversary of 
its first session today with a joint meeting of the house and senate 
and a look back at two centuries of achievement and high hopes 
the antique gavel of the senate and the historic mace of the 
house were carried into the floor of the house and the designs of 
bicentennial postage stamps and coins were unveiled 
howard nemerov the poet laureate of the united states read a 
poem about congress at the beginning of its third century 
here the million varying wills get melted down get hammered 
out until the movies reduced to stills that tell us what the laws 
about he read 
so its a republic as franklin said if you can keep it 
and we did this far and hope to keep our quarrel funny and just 
though with this moral 
praise without end for the goahead zeal of whoever it was 
invented the wheel but never a word for the poor souls sake that 
thought ahead and invented the brake 
senate majority leader george miitchell dmaine recalling the 
11200 men and women who have served in congress since the first 
session in 1789 told the assembly we stretch out our hands 
across two centuries and we say to them if we have not matched your 
record of accomplishment we hope at least we have been worthy of 
your trust 
todays celebration commemorated a date on which a process was 
begun but nothing of importance really happened 
when congress convened in new york city in march 1789 it took a 
month and more to achieve the house and senate quorums that enabled 
both chambers to get down to actual work 
as a matter of convenience congress is celebrating the day of 
its birth on the wrong date 
the first session took place on march 4 1789 not march 2 
but the actual 200th anniversary falls on saturday the congress 
of 1989 the 101st congress will not be in session that day 
march 4 1789 was a day of celebration in new york city complete 
with waving flags the ringing of church bells and the firing of 
cannon salutes 
but the senate journal for that first day was less joyful 
only 13 of the 59 representatives and eight of the 22 senators 
showed up 
the journal entry read the number not being suffience to 
establish a quorum they adjourned 
sen robert c byrd dwva in his new collection of speeches 
on the history of congress notes that the continued lack of a 
quorum which continued day after day led to nervousness that the 
new congress established under the constitution would continue the 
pattern of absenteeism and paralysis set by the defunct congress 
which operated under the articles of confederation 
appeals went out for members to attend 
rep fusher ames of massachusetts was worried as late winter 
turned into early spring 
we lose credit spirit everything he recorded in his 
journal the public will forget the government before it is born 
but finally the appeals were heeded 
on april 1 thomas scott came over the alleghenies from western 
pennsylvania to give the house its first quorum but it was not 
until april 6 when richard henry lee arrived from virginia that 
the first quorum of 12 senators was secured byrd wrote 
once that quorum was established the senate and house 
accomplished work and set precedents that have stood the test of two 
centuries 
that first congress adopted the bill of rights the first 10 
amendments to the constitution established the supreme court and 
other divisions of the federal court system counted the first 
electoral ballots that seated george washington as the first 
president passed the first tariff legislation to provide an income 
for the federal government and created the structure and committees 
of both houses 
but dr raymond smock the historian of the house says a certain 
unfortunate aspect of it all lingers on 
i wish the house had begun its official work on march 31 or 
april 2 or on any day other than april 1 he says 
i can already see the jokes and media madness during this 
bicentennial year that will focus on how the house finally got down 
to business on april fools day and how nothing has changed 
since

the bhopal compensation case became 
entangled in legalities today when the supreme court agreed to hear 
a petition challenging the governments authority to reach a 
settlement with the union carbide corp 
the court also agreed to hear four other petitions that called 
for either an increase in compensation or asked for court guidance 
on how relief should be distributed among victims of the worlds 
deadliest industrial disaster 
the decision came two weeks after the supreme court announced a 
settlement with union carbide 
in february the usbased company agreed to pay damages of 470 
million to victims of the dec 3 1984 leak of methyl isocyanate 
from the pesticide plant operated by union carbides indian 
subsidiary in bhopal 
union carbide whose headquarters are in danbury conn has 
already deposited the money with the court 
the key petition filed today challenged the indian governments 
authority to represent the 3300 people who died in the tragedy or 
the estimated 20000 others injured by the deadly gas 
under a 1985 act the indian government was given sole authority 
to represent all victims of the tragedy after hundreds of indian and 
us lawyers said they would represent victims in separate cases 
i have a very strong case said charanlal sahu a bhopal 
attorney who said he and his family were affected by exposure to the 
gas the act goes against the indian constitution the victims 
have no confidence in the ability of the union of india 
you cant snatch away an individuals fundamental right to be 
heard in a court of law he said but the indian government by 
a stroke of a pen became the sole representative of all the 
victims 
chief justice rs pathak said he would hear sahus case 
there is urgency in the matter it is a case involving the 
countrys constitution pathak said 
a court official speaking on condition of anonymity said four 
other petitions from two gas victims associations and two human 
rights lawyers may come up for hearings friday 
we do not want to delay the matter any more the official 
said 
but sahu said if the court agrees to give the petitions a full 
hearing it will take at least six months to reach any decisions 
one petition suggested the indian government pay the difference 
between the 3 billion for which the indian government originally 
sued and the 470 million settlement other petitions asked for an 
increase in compensation as well as jobs for victims and their 
families

republicans and democrats alike lined up in 
near unison on the senate floor on june 23 1967 to take the 
extraordinary step of censuring one of their own 
on a day that would spell the eventual end of his political 
career and leave deep scars on his family thomas dodd the veteran 
connecticut democrat accused of misusing campaign funds could count 
his advocates on a single hand one of the few a young republican 
senator from texas named john tower 
now dodds son who followed in his late fathers political 
footsteps is faced with a personally agonizing decision whether to 
vote with his democratic colleagues against towers nomination for 
defense secretary or support a man who backed his father even when 
longtime friends and political allies wouldnt 
the two senate dramas separated by 22 years have become 
inseparably linked for sen christopher j dodd a potential swing 
vote on the tower nomination 
dodd who according to aides remains undecided has said towers 
support of his father will not be the deciding factor in his 
decision on the nomination but towers actions which included 
several lastminute attempts to water down the elder dodds 
punishment weigh on the mind of the son 
of course i havent forgotten how john tower voted what kind 
of son would i be if i did dodd said 
dodd spokesman jason isaacson called the past tower connection a 
minor consideration more important to dodd according to 
isaacson is deciding for himself about the propriety of towers 
activities as a defense consultant after leaving the senate 
he will cast a vote as a united states senator and not simply 
as tom dodds son the aide said 
but others familiar with the senators thinking believe the 
painful memory of his fathers political demise could be a powerful 
factor 
he definitely feels his dad got railroaded and feels a loyalty 
to those who defended his father said one democrat who requested 
anonymity 
it is easy to remember those who were in tom dodds corner in 
june of 1967 because there were so few 
voting against censure were dodd sen russell b long dla 
fellow connecticut democrat abraham ribicoff sen strom thurmond 
rsc and tower 
long spearheaded dodds defense on the senate floor and gave a 
sixhour speech defending his longtime friend but tower also played 
a key role 
a week into the emotional floor debate tower offered a 
compromise amendment that would have changed the censure to a 
reprimand removed the word dishonor and rephrased contrary to 
accepted morals to contrary to accepted standards of conduct 
that was defeated 879 
the next day another tower proposal that would have modified the 
language to a lesser degree was defeated 7818 before the senate 
voted 925 for a censure resolution that said dodd had engaged in 
conduct which is contrary to accepted morals derogates from the 
public trust expected of a senator and tends to bring the senate 
into dishonor and disrepute 
the vote was based on evidence that dodd took 116083 from 
testimonial dinners for his personal use he argued that the funds 
were not intended for his campaign but were personal gifts and he 
should have been allowed to use the money any way he pleased 
tower said he felt censure was unfair since at the time there was 
no code of ethics 
in a floor speech during the nine days of debate tower recalled 
a story about prescott bush the onetime connecticut senator and 
late father of president bush 
it has been said that we have a pretty clubby atmosphere around 
here tower said a young lady rushed up to prescott bush and 
said senator bush is it true that the senate is a very exclusive 
club that the members are very courteous and deferential to each 
other regardless of differences of political belief 
he replied yes young lady it is true but when one of us 
breaks a leg we eat him

sales of new singlefamily homes posted their 
biggest gain in seven months during january the government reported 
thursday but analysts said the 49 percent increase was due in part 
to unusually mild winter weather 
sales reached a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 704000 in 
january following a 2 percent increase in december the commerce 
department said new sales were bolstered by strong activity in the 
midwest 
dave seiders chief economist for the national association of 
home builders said much of januarys increase probably occurred 
because warm weather brought more people out to shop for homes 
borrowing sales from future months 
the increase also may reflect a temporary dip in mortgage 
interest rates during the month which gave home buyers a window 
of opportunity to move into the market seiders said 
januarys strong showing aside analysts still are forecasting a 
decline in construction of singlefamily homes this year based on 
expectations that mortgage rates will rise during the first half of 
1989 and the economy will slow 
new home sales had edged up a slim 09 percent during 1988 after 
plunging 105 percent in 1987 when the drop was blamed on increased 
interest rates and a slowdown in demand after five strong sales 
years 
after temporarily sliding during january fixedrate home 
mortgages resumed their climb in february and last week were 
averaging 1078 percent up from 987 percent a year earlier 
according to a national survey by the federal home loan mortgage 
corp 
economists predict rates could reach 12 percent this year 
although the increasing popularity of adjustablerate mortgages that 
offer lower initial interest rates could mitigate damage to the 
singlefamily housing market 
as the federal reserve board continues to push up interest rates 
in an effort to slow economic growth and restrain inflation higher 
rates are really going to bite into the housing market said 
economist richard peach of the mortgage bankers association 
we are going to start to see some modest declines in housing 
market activity once we get the numbers for march april and may 
peach predicted 
seiders said that with financial troubles plaguing the nations 
savings and loans which are the largest lenders of adjustablerate 
mortgages were kind of worried about the funds situation as we 
go out through 1989 
januarys increase in home sales was the biggest monthly jump 
since a 54 percent increase last june 
the strength was concentrated in the midwest where sales rose 
222 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 110000 
seiders said the increase was largely due to mild weather in that 
region although the midwests housing market also has been aided by 
the strength of manufacturing industries experiencing rising export 
sales 
sales last month were up 8 percent in the west and rose 09 
percent in the northeast but declined 19 percent in the south 
the median price for a new home meanwhile declined 69 percent 
in january to 113000 meaning half the homes sold for more and 
half for less the average price which is pulled up by sales of 
very expensive homes also was down falling 82 percent to 137100 
peach said the drop in price probably was linked to the shift of 
sales toward the lessexpensive midwest rather than any trend toward 
declining prices nationally

president bush voiced doubts in talks today 
with guatemalas president about the recent central american peace 
agreement that would disband the contra forces as he mulls keeping 
them alive with us aid bushs spokesman said 
bush told president vinicio cerezo the united states is concerned 
about the commitment of the ruling sandinistas to live up to their 
promises of democratic reform in nicaragua in exchange for 
demobilizing the 11000strong contra army said white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater 
fitzwater said no decison has been made on what the 
administration will propose to congress when the current 27 million 
contra aid package runs out at the end of this month 
but he indicated some new humanitarian aid likely will be sought 
in the meantime the central american presidents still must work out 
details of their new peace agreement 
in the general agreement last month they said they would come up 
with specifics on how to disband the contras and impose the 
accompanying conditions in nicaragua within 90 days a deadline that 
falls after the congra aid package expires 
were reviewing the matter now with a view toward the 
humanitarian aid fitzwater said in his daily press briefing he 
did not mention military aid saying we would like a diplomatic 
solution 
cerezo speaking to reporters after the session said we have 
talked in the central american countries about humanitarian aid at 
least in this moment to keep the contras organized while nicaragua 
works out conditions to repatriate them 
us officials have expressed concerns about likely timetables 
and enforcement mechanisms by which the sandinistas will be kept to 
their promises 
bush joined by secretary of state james a baker and numerous 
aides in his oval office session with cerezo declined to answer a 
question on whether he feels the contras should be kept together for 
a year or so as has been proposed in some quarters 
baker is considering proposing aid to keep the rebel forces 
intact while waiting to see if the sandinistas keep their word 
according to sources quoted in todays washington post 
cerezo met wednesday with vice president dan quayle on the same 
topics aides said 
cerezo told reporters that nicaragua should make democratic 
reforms such as freeing of political prisoners before and at the 
time of a final agreement to demobilize the contra forces that have 
battled the sandinistas for more than seven years but cerezo was 
not specific on what reforms should be made when 
cerezo said administration officials still have reservations 
about the peace agreement reached two weeks ago by the presidents of 
the five central american nations costa rica el salvador 
guatemala honduras and nicaragua 
us officials have said that the diplomatic approach should be 
given a chance but that they are skeptical of the sandinistas 
commitment to live up to their promises unless there are adequate 
enforcement mechanisms 
in the past the usfunded contras were said to constitute such 
a mechanism 
previous peace talks have collapsed in disagreement over what 
should occur first disarmament of the rebels or internal 
democractic reforms in nicaragua 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega pledged in the agreement last 
month to free political prisoners hold early elections with united 
nations observers allow opposition parties access to the media and 
repatriate the contras 
the agreement contained no timetable for such actions and the 
presidents said such details would be in a plan they would work out 
by the end of 90 days 
cerezo during a photo session with quayle said the sandinistas 
should implement the reforms before and at the same time when we 
affirm the plans for the contras demobilization 
cerezo said he assured quayle the contras would disarm in an 
orderly manner 
the vice president also brought up guatemalan human rights with 
cerezo said an official speaking on condition of anonymity and 
revealing no further details 
state department sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
said that guatemala has a continuing pattern of human rights abuses 
and that the government must bring those responsible for politically 
motivated crimes to justice 
americas watch a private human rights group has said that 
guatemalas record on the rights issue is far worse than the 
administration is willing to concede 
juan mendez the groups executive director told congress last 
month that guatemala continues to have one of the worst human 
rights records in the western hemisphere 
one state department official said us officials do not share 
that dismal assessment and that it was unlikely the americans would 
hit cerezo very hard on human rights

the mcdonnell douglas corp increased its 
military business last year despite an overall decline in pentagon 
spending retaining the title of americas largest defense 
contractor 
releasing today its annual rating of the top 100 military 
contractors the pentagon said mcdonnell douglas substantially 
widened its lead over general dynamics corp and general electric 
co in fiscal 1988 because contract totals declined for the the 
second and thirdranked contractors 
st louisbased mcdonnell douglas received military contracts 
worth 8 billion in fiscal 1988 up from 77 billion in fiscal 1987 
and far ahead of the 65 won by no 2 general dynamics 
ge received military contracts worth 57 billion in fiscal 1988 
general dynamics pentagon business declined from 7 billion in 
fiscal 1987 to 65 billion last year while ges business declined 
from 58 billion to 57 billion 
the remainder of the top 10 in fiscal 1988 included tenneco inc 
with 51 billion raytheon co with 41 billion martin marietta 
corp with 37 billion general motors corp with 36 billion 
lockheed corp with 354 billion united technologies corp with 
351 billion and the boeing co with 3 billion 
the report entitled 100 companies receiving the largest dollar 
volume of prime contract awards covers the fiscal year ending 
last sept 30 and is considered the most definitive gauge of how 
major military contractors are faring each year 
the report discloses the pentagons contractors were fighting 
over a smaller pie in fiscal 1988 with prime contracts totaling 
137 billion being parceled out that is 55 billion less than the 
total awarded in fiscal 1987 
the top 100 companies as a group saw their share of those 
contracts decline last year the 100 firms received 901 billion of 
the contracts or 658 percent of the total compared to 954 
billion and 669 percent in fiscal 1987 
the smallest total amount received by a company in the fiscal 
1988 list was 129 million compared to 122 million in fiscal 
1987 the pentagon added 
the biggest change in the fiscal 1988 rankings was the rise of 
tenneco a company that ranked 13th in fiscal 1987 tennecos jump 
to fourth in the rankings was based on orders from the navy for two 
nuclearpowered aircraft carriers received by the newport news 
shipbuilding amp drydock co a wholly owned subsidiary 
this was the second consecutive year that mcdonnell douglas 
ranked first mcdonnell douglas reclaimed the no 1 ranking in 
fiscal 1987 after being shouldered aside the year earlier by general 
dynamics 
some of mcdonnells larger contracts include the fa18 hornet 
fighter for the navy the f15 eagle for the air force the ah64 
apache helicopter gunship for the army and the av8b harrier jump 
jet for the marine corps the company also builds tomahawk and 
harpoon missile systems

william j bennett assured senators today he 
would defend the civil liberties of americans as coordinator of the 
governments antidrug fight although this war is not for 
delicate sensibilities 
in his second day of confirmation hearings as director of 
national drug control policy the former education secretary 
defended his support of school officials who set up metal detectors 
and take other measures to control violence and drug abuse in the 
schools 
this war is not for delicate sensibilities he told the 
senate judiciary committee this is tough stuff 
however during a philosophical discussion with committee 
chairman joseph r biden jr ddel bennett said i cant 
imagine circumstances in the near future that would require us 
to suspend civil liberties in the cause of fighting drugs 
they are the base they are the cement they are the anchor 
they sometimes cause us difficulties in this war but these are 
the ends you cant destroy the fabric of the country in order to 
defend the country bennett said 
he said he opposed some who were arguing for universal drug 
testing of students 
when biden asked his reason for that resistance bennett replied 
because im sensitive to the constitution the fourth amendment 
which prohibits unreasonable search and seizure 
the hearing concluded today after representatives of the league 
of united latin american citizens and the association for 
supervision and curriculum development offered testimony critical of 
bennetts nomination 
biden who said wednesday that my intent is to move this 
nomination as quickly as possible scheduled a committee vote for 
next thursday 
among the committee members only sens howard metzenbaum 
dohio and paul simon dill indicated they might vote against 
bennett 
the senators praised bennetts assertions that he would handle 
the job aggressively tackling all the nittygritty details of 
coordinating the antidrug efforts ending turf battles between 
agencies and focusing on treatment and prevention as well as law 
enforcement 
but sen edward m kennedy drew bennett out on whether he would 
support a ban on semiautomatic combatstyle weapons used by drug 
traffickers 
a host of drugrelated shootings and the killing of five 
california schoolchildren have prompted calls for a ban on 
militarystyle semiautomatic weapons with highcapacity ammunition 
clips president bush has said he opposed such regulation while 
mrs bush supports a ban 
at wednesdays hearing kennedy pulled out a memo bennett had 
written march 14 1988 to then attorney general edwin meese iii in 
which he asked meese to considering support of legislation to 
better manage the production importation and sale of automatic 
weapons and other firearms 
when kennedy asked him whether he now would support legislation 
limiting access to such weapons as ak47s and uzis bennett said 
it depends on what it is and added that it would be part of the 
national drug control strategy that he will be called upon to put 
together within 180 days of taking office 
the weapons in question are semiautomatic adaptations of ak47s 
and uzis the tightly regulated military versions can switch back 
and forth from semiautomatic to automatic 
i will admit a personal reservation about private ownership of 
ak47s bennett said im not a gun owner the president 
knows i have my concerns 
metzenbaum questioned bennett about how many minority group 
members he had hired to the new office and how many he planned to 
hire and simon criticized bennetts failure to file a minority 
hiring plan with the equal employment opportunity commission when he 
headed the education department 
bennett said he would stand on his record on employment of 
minorities when he headed the education department and the national 
endowment for the humanities saying i have a record as good as 
anybody 
we will make every effort to fill the positions with the best 
people we can find bennett said will i hire someone to a job 
just because hes a minority no thats an insult to that person 
bennett told the committee that he felt he could do the drug czar 
job well although there will be no quick victories in the war 
against drugs 
it will take more than 180 days to turn the tide around he 
said 
bennett said he would use the job both as as bully pulpit and as 
a way to coordinate and direct the drugfighting activities of 
government agencies and he said he has been getting cooperation 
from the heads of agencies hell be dealing with as drug czar 
ive been getting my calls returned he said im even 
getting some calls returned that i didnt make

a miami man today described how oliver north 
ran a 1985 meeting that focused on the contra rebels opening a southern 
front in their war against the leftist government of 
nicaragua 
rafael quintero a cubanamerican who helped coordinate the 
contra arms supply effort testified at the trial ocwhe former 
white house aide that basically mr north was in charge of the 
june 28 1985 meeting at miami international airport 
also attending the meeting he said were contra leaders adolfo 
calero and enrique bermudez as well as retired air force maj gen 
richard secord and his associate thomas clines an excia official 
who were involved in obtaininbbrms and shipping them to the contras 
at the meeting it was norths suggestion to open a southern 
front quintero told a jury in us district court 
he added that north also discussed the possibility of sinking a 
barge to obstruct the rama river in order to cut off a military supply 
line that nickrfguas sandinista government was using eighty 
percent of the supplies passed across the river quintero said 
quintero also testified he once heard north say that president 
reagan backed the clandestine effort to resupply the contras 
this quintero said at a 1986 meeting in el salvador when a 
high el savadoran official tried to get a commitment for continued 
aid this high official was not going to stick his neck out and 
have it cut off said quintero 
mr north pointed out the president was very much aware of the 
efforts this high salvadoran official was doing that the president 
wanted these efforts to continue he added in broken english 
further quintero testified north told the salvadoran that when 
aid resumed legally as it did in 1986 that the 
salvadorans position would become much easier than now 
quintero said that in 1985 he returned from an inspection tour of 
contra operations in central america while in the vienna va 
offices of secord the retired general telephoned north telling him 
the little man from the south just came by with a report 
quintero testified 
quintero a veteran of the 1961 bay of pigs invasion of cuba who 
did work for the cia said secord had enlisted his help in assisting 
the contras and that he was paid some 228000 over two years for 
his efforts including expenses 
quintero also described an incident in 1986 in el salvador when 
north settled a dispute bettween factions over which should receive 
air drops of supplies douth decreed that col james steele former 
commander of us forces in el salvador and joe fernandez cia 
station chief in costa rica should have the final word said 
quintero he said he made 16 trips to central america from january 
to june 1986 to oversee construction of an airstrip designed to 
bolster a southern military front for the contras 
the prosecution team in the north trial put quintero on the 
witness stand after defense attorney brendan sullivan said he had no 
questions on crossexamination for the previous witness retired 
army maj gen john singlaub 
on wednesday singlaub testified about a series of contacts with 
north from 1984 to 1986 when congress had banned us military aid 
to the contras 
the government is trying to prove that north lied to congress 
about his efforts to help the contras during the aid ban 
prosecutors introduced a letter that singlaub sent to thencia 
director william casey a few days before north then a national 
security council aide told a house panel he hadnt had any contact 
with singlaub for 20 months 
singlaubs letter to the cia suggested otherwise and singlaub 
testified that he in fact met with north maybe six times from 
the summer of 1985 to august 1986 
in addition singlaub said he had contacts perhaps one or two 
times a month with north through robert owen norths courier to 
the contras during the period and said he spoke to north on the 
telephone on four to six occasions 
the letter to casey included a list of weapons available for 
shipment to the contras the letter said the list was developed in 
conjunction with a member of the national security council who 
is knowledgeable of the urgentness of the united nicaraguan 
opposition with which the us has a continuing interest singlaub 
testified that he was referring to north

sen alan cranston said thursday that there 
have been two instances in the past in which defense secretaries 
decided not to carry out a presidential order because they felt 
that the president had had a bit too much to drink 
the california democrat did not identify the occasions except to 
say they had occurred under different secretaries and different 
presidents 
the senate democratic whip made his comments at a breakfast 
meeting with reporters in which he discussed john towers troubled 
nomination to become defense secretary a spokesman later said 
cranston will oppose the nomination which is is jeopardy of being 
rejected by the democraticcontrolled senate 
cranston mentioned the two incidents to reporters saying they 
were indications that the nation cannot afford to have a secretary 
of defense who might be under the influence of alcohol and unable 
to make a thoughtful and wise quick decision on a matter of life 
and death for our country 
tower has been buffeted by questions about his drinking habits 
cranstons office issued a partial transcript of the breakfast 
session and the senator said his information on the two incidents 
came from what i consider an unimpeachable source thats familiar 
as anyone is with military matters 
he said there have been two instances since the position of 
defense secretary was created in which the pentagon chief decided 
not to carry out presidential orders because he felt that the 
president had had a bit too much to drink at that time and decided 
to wait until the president was sober before seeing if that was 
still what the president wanted to do 
cranston was later asked whether the orders were renewed when the 
unknown president woke up no i do not he said i believe but 
i do not know that the order was not repeated in wiser moments 
cranston said neither of the incidents he was referring to 
involved a widely rumored incident in 1974 when defense secretary 
james schlesinger issued an order to the armed forces not to execute 
any orders he had not personally approved richard nixon was 
president at the time and in the throes of an impeachment crisis 
spawned by watergate

an art exhibit that appears to invite people to 
step on the american flag reopened on a limited basis today and a 
judge later dismissed a lawsuit by veterans demanding that the 
banner be removed from the floor 
the school of the art institute closed the gallery friday 
following protests by veterans but announced wednesday the show 
would reopen for students faculty and staff only the exhibit was 
closed to the press and public 
the school cited the students right of free expression in 
reopening the exhibit 
a majority of students intensely dislike the way the flag is 
displayed but they take a strong stand on first amendment rights 
said peter brown the schools vice president they want their 
rights protected because someday it may be them 
students at the institute today immediately demanded that the 
exhibit be opened to the public 
only in a space open to the public does freedom of expression 
truly exist said luis browne a student spokesman restricted 
viewing is censorship 
the decision to reopen the exhibit drew protests from veterans 
groups who filed a lawsuit wednesday seeking to remove the flag 
from the floor but the suit was dismissed today by cook county 
judge kenneth gillis after a 90minute hearing 
what were objecting to of course is that it is the 
american flag and the flag is being disgraced walked on john 
mahoney of the american legion said wednesday 
this is totally unacceptable to the veterans groups said 
joseph a morris general counsel for the midamerica legal 
foundation which represents the veterans of foreign wars disabled 
american veterans and the military order of the purple heart among 
others 
the flag placement invites people to participate in flag 
desecration in violation of federal and state statutes morris 
said there are some things you cant do using art as an excuse 
the work by student scott tyler titled what is the proper way 
to display a us flag features a flag spread on the floor in 
front of a montage depicted in the photographs are flagdraped 
coffins south koreans burning the us flag and other scenes 
visitors are invited to comment in a ledger on a shelf in front of 
the exhibit 
the veterans complain that in doing so most will step on the 
flag morris said a viewer would have to be an acrobat or an 
extremely tall person to write comments without trampling on the 
flag 
but in a statement wednesday school officials said it is not 
necessary for the viewer to walk on the flag to write in the book 
there is sufficient room to stand on either side of the flag 
for those viewers who choose to write comments in the book 
tyler has said that although the us flag symbolizes freedom to 
some people it represents domination and oppression to others 
its the second time in a year that an exhibit at the school has 
stirred controversy black aldermen stormed its halls last year to 
take down a portrait of the late harold washington the citys first 
black mayor who was depicted by a student wearing frilly womens 
underwear

a palestinian youth his chest wrapped in a 
bloody bandage dies of a plastic bullet wound his relatives scream 
and bang their fists on hospital doors to express their grief 
the dramatic scenes in the occupied gaza strip are part of a new 
israeli army instruction film shown to foreign journalists 
thursday that commanders say is intended to counter a tendency by 
soldiers to use too much force when quelling arab rioters 
this death oils the wheels of the uprising the narrator 
says summing up one key message of the film at a time when israel 
is coming under increasing criticism for harsh treatment of 
palestinian stonethrowers 
at least 388 palestinians have been killed during the nearly 
15monthold rebellion against israeli rule most by army gunfire 
and several from beatings seventeen israelis including six 
soldiers also have died 
brig gen ehud gross the armys chief education officer said 
the 40minute movie reflects concern in the military about soldiers 
using excessive force against protesters 
you know about the use of excessive power we have some 
problems with it you have a small unit with a mission in the gaza 
strip someone loses his temper and uses too much power gross 
said 
we try to reduce the feeling of trying to use excessive power 
when you get into a situation where you are humiliated or hurt to 
teach them to cope with it bury it put it behind you he added 
disciplinary action for these breaches have been taken against 
several hundred troops during the uprising about 50 have been put 
on trial 
gross indicated that illegal use of force was even more 
widespread because troops hesitated to report on their colleagues 
because they dont want to violate the value of solidarity 
excessive beating has raised particular concern among officials 
after scenes of soldiers clubbing palestinians began appearing on 
foreign tv newscasts 
this problem was dramatized this week at the trial of four troops 
accused of beating a man in jebalya refugee camp to death last 
summer while conducting an arrest in the occupied gaza strip 
israels chief of staff lt gen dan shomron who testified at 
the trial wednesday said the policy of beating was intended to 
subdue rioters not inflict punishment but he noted there is a 
gray area where the soldiers must use their own discretion 
gross said the film was made partly to address this issue we 
understand there is some confusion so we dont want to leave so 
much open to interpretation 
the movie shows scenes of soldiers using clubs against rioters 
and a narrator points out which beatings were illegal 
shomron is also shown saying it must be clear that at the 
moment when your goal is completed there is no use of force for 
punishment or revenge 
the film also shows tank battles in an attempt to point out the 
difference between regular combat and confronting civilian violence 
we are trained to destroy our enemy but today we are fighting 
on a different kind of front what kind of a battleground is this 
the narrator says as a jeep is shown cruising through a dusty 
refugee camp 
another segment shows a soldier firing his rifle repeatedly at 
about a 45 degree angle on a street after being stoned by protesters 
this is wrong it is indiscriminate shooting it causes many 
casualties sometimes innocent people the narrator says 
we need to maintain our selfcontrol the narrator adds 
after a scene in which a soldier says i felt this incredible 
anger they were cursing at us throwing stones and we couldnt do 
anything to stop it i just wanted to grab someone and do 
idontknowwhat to him 
gross said the film has been shown to all reservists sent to 
patrol in gaza since december and that a second film was being 
produced about the west bank 
soldiers also undergo two or threeday sessions in which they 
are taught how to deal with rioters gross said 
although the main goal is to reduce casualties the troops also 
are urged not to shy away from confrontations with protesters he 
added 
we are trying to help soldiers cope with the dilemmas they 
face how to deal with morals and fulfill their mission best 
gross said we also dont want to avoid contact or they the 
protesters will gain ground and you find youselves pushed out to 
main roads

the senate began its formal debate on john 
towers troubled nomination as defense secretary today as two 
additional democrats joined the ranks of the opposition and a key 
republican insisted that confirmation is still winnable 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater conceded that 
despite two days of personal lobbying president bush had not 
yet been able to persuade any democrats to line up in favor of 
confirmation 
sen sam nunn led off the longawaited floor debate on the 
nomination and the georgia democrat who chairs the armed services 
committee said he was acting with a sense of sorrow in leading 
the opposition to his former senate colleague 
nunn said that when the committee began its hearings into towers 
nomination he expected that he would in good faith support the 
nominee my mind was changed by the facts presented to the 
committee he said adding he was concerned over towers drinking 
habits his work for the defense consulting industry and his 
behavior toward women 
sen john warner rva in rebuttal for the republicans 
extolled tower for incalculable contributions to the united 
states in 24 years in the senate and later service on an arms 
negotiationg team 
he said 70 current senators served with tower and not one has 
come forward to challenge in any way the discharge of his duties as 
a united states senator not one 
nunn predicted some vigorous debate over the next several 
days a forecast almost certainly to be accurate with republicans 
trying to spend time marshaling public support on behalf of the 
nomination 
no senate vote is expected until next week 
tower has been battling questions of drinking habits allegations 
of womanizing and questions over possible conflicts of interest 
stemming from his work as a defense industry consultant 
the debate began as aides to sens alan cranston of california 
and terry sanford of north carolina said both men would vote against 
the nomination bringing the number of democrats in opposition to 
38 
appearing on abcs good morning america several hours 
earlier warner said i think its winnable in the sense that we 
get the american public involved in this 
and as soon as this debate starts im confident that theyll 
communicate with the members of the senate its important that we 
not have a soap opera or a civil war in the senate but a fair and 
factual debate said warner the ranking republican on the armed 
services committee 
cranston the senate democratic whip said through an aide that 
he would vote against the nomination 
an aide to sanford rafe greenlee said his boss had come to the 
same conclusion after closely following the hearings and reading 
the fbi report on towers background check 
an associated press tally at midday showed 43 democrats and 
republican larry pressler of south dakota either solidly opposed or 
leaning in opposition and 40 republicans either solidly or leaning 
in favor 
democrats hold a 5545 majority in the senate 
at the white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
president bush still believes all allegations against tower are 
unfounded 
he praised the nominees combatative appearance on wednesday at a 
questionandanswer session at the national press club 
we thought senator towers performance yesterday was excellent 
it showed that hes a fighter and a scrappy guy and just the man to 
take over the defense department the spokesman said 
fitzwater said the white house is in full accord with senate 
republican leader bob doles plans to delay a final vote on tower 
we think everybody should have a chance to register their vote 
and you never know you might change some at the last minute 
fitzwater said but when asked if the white house could name one 
democrat who had been won over he said not yet 
tower meanwhile attended a meeting this morning at the white 
house with bush adm william crowe chairman of the joint chiefs of 
staff and acting defense secretary william h taft iv 
fitzwater said the meeting dealt with pentagon management reforms 
and an ongoing review of strategic issues and not specifically with 
towers confirmation battle 
the developments came against a backdrop of the republicans 
determination to wage a lengthy and vigorous senate debate over 
tower while the man at the center of the storm said he has no 
intention of giving up 
never surrender or retreat the former texas senator said at 
his press club appearance wednesday quoting the commander of the 
texas forces at the alamo 
tower renewed his vow to abstain from drinking if he is 
confirmed asked if he had ever broken any previous pledges 
including wedding vows the twicedivorced tower said he had broken 
marital vows 
i think i probably am not alone in that connection he added 
tower also said he would not return to the defense consulting 
industry even if his confirmation fails 
sen william cohen rmaine said there would be a vigorous 
debate on the senate floor adding that the issue involved is more 
important than a single nomination 
bush met at the white house on wednesday with additional senators 
in his effort to win democrats over to support the nomination he 
summarized his appeal this way 
do what youve got to do but remember fair play remember 
decency and honor and then remember also historically the concept of 
advice and consent where reasonable doubt is given historically to 
the president of the united states who after all is responsible for 
the executive branch of this government 
but if bushs lobbying was paying dividends there was no public 
evidence of it 
sen william armstrong rcolo complained in a speech that 
information about tower should be made public rather than kept 
hidden in a confidential fbi report one senior administration 
official c boyden gray traveled to the capitol during the day to 
meet with key senators to discuss whether any of the information 
could be made public 
some of the specific allegations against tower have surfaced in 
news reports the washington post today quoted a retired air force 
sergeant as saying tower appeared drunk and fondled women on two 
visits to bergstrom air force base in texas in 1976 and 1978 
fitzwater the white house spokesman dismissed those allegations 
as more innuendo and rumor

a senate committee voted 100 today to confirm 
edward j derwinski as the first secretary of veterans affairs 
although the chairman criticized derwinski for tipping off south 
koreans 12 years ago that one of their agents was about to defect 
i conclude that what he did in 1977 was wrong and that the 
entire record demonstrates that he has often not been candid or 
forthcoming about it said sen alan cranston dcalif chairman 
of the veterans affairs committee 
however when weighed against 30 years of service in congress and 
the state department i do not find his indiscretions as to this 
one incident to be disqualifying cranston said 
i am optimistic about mr derwinskis potential to rise above 
this unattractive episode to put it behind him once and for all 
cranston said 
derwinski was questioned at length about his remarks on the 
korean defection in a private session of the committee on tuesday 
and again in public wednesday 
derwinski 62 a former congressman and state department 
official was the ranking republican member of a house committee 
investigating the koreagate scandal in september 1977 when he 
was told by the committee staff that a korean official was going to 
defect 
derwinski said he encountered a korean embassy official that day 
on the steps of or near the longworth house office building 
in the process of the conversation and without giving the 
matter any serious thought i casually observed something to the 
effect that the next problem they would have with our committee was 
one of their officials as a witness he said 
derwinski said there was nothing malicious or intentional to 
what i did and contended i honestly do not believe i ever 
endangered anyone 
i also acknowledge it wasnt a very wise thing to do in fact 
a rather stupid thing to do derwinski said 
the senate foreign relations committee has examined the korean 
agent question twice before in derwinskis 1983 and 1987 
confirmations for state department posts then the incident 
attracted little attention 
the veterans committee was unable to obtain information from a 
grand jury that investigated the incident derwinski under 
questioning by cranston said that on the advice of his attorney he 
had declined to answer questions from the grand jury citing the 
speech and debate clause of the constitution on grounds of 
possible interference by another branch into his duties as a 
congressman 
cranston said subsequent court rulings have narrowed the 
interpretation of that clause so that it would no longer be 
available as grounds to avoid answering questions in such a case 
derwinski had also faced allegations about links to alleged 
former nazi collaborators through his service on the national 
republican heritage groups council a gop group aimed at attracting 
ethnic voters cranston said that after reading a special fbi report 
he was satisfied that the nominee has done nothing wrong 
derwinski said he was unaware of the backgrounds of his 
associates on the heritage committee 
derwinski a 12term republican congressional veteran from 
illinois was appointed counselor to the state department in 1983 
and later became under secretary for security assistance science 
and technology 
though the korean affair attracted most attention money problems 
with veterans programs were also a key topic for derwinski and the 
committee va officials have testified that they will be 600 
million to 1 billion short in their medical care budget this year 
and derwinski pledged to be an advocate for the va budget before the 
white houses office of management and budget

gary busey his head scarred from a 
nearfatal motorcycle crash says he still opposes mandatory helmet 
laws a position ridiculed today by a government physician 
the 44yearold actor in his first public appearance since the 
crash dec 4 said wednesday he could be a vegetable if he had 
been wearing a helmet 
dr jeffrey saks of the centers for disease controls injury 
control division said 4000 motorcycle riders are killed each year 
and 360000 injured most of the deaths and serious disabilities 
are due to head injuries and helmets significantly reduce the 
chances of a head injury he said 
about buseys continued opposition to helmets sacks said im 
assuming he doesnt have residual brain damage that led to what he 
said 
busey said he plans to help raise money to fight helmet laws as 
he did before his accident during a news conference wednesday 
buseys publicists distributed a pamphlet extolling helmetless 
riding 
in the crash buseys unprotected head struck a curb and he 
underwent brain surgery to remove two blood clots he was 
hospitalized for two months 
a scar starting near the top of buseys right ear and continuing 
to the top of his scalp was visible underneath his short hair 
busey who won an oscar nomination as best actor for the title 
role in the 1978 film the buddy holly story said he favored a 
law mandating helmets only for motorcyclists ages 16 to 21 i felt 
that way before the accident he said 
in fact busey insisted i could have been more seriously 
injured with a helmet i could have broken my neck if id had on 
a helmet 
helmets cut down your peripheral vision they cut off your 
hearing and they stop your neck from rotating he said 
busey looked fit and walked without any visible problems 
although he said he was suffering some posttraumatic amnesia 
busey reported that his recovery was nearly 100 percent complete 
he blamed his accident on excessive speed and an oil puddle he 
has yet to resume riding his motorcycle which he said has been 
repaired 
busey had just completed hider in the house at the time of 
the crash another film howling at the moon has been put on 
hold pending his recovery

scientists industrialists and government officials 
from around the world gather sunday to discuss how to eliminate 
synthetic chemicals that are destroying the earths ozone shield 
more than 110 countries have accepted britains invitation to 
attend the threeday conference saving the ozone layer said 
environment secretary nicholas ridley 
scientists say compounds known as chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs 
are destroying the layer of ozone that shields the planet from the 
suns cancercausing ultraviolet rays 
they also trap heat and reflect it back to earth which gradually 
warms the planets surface and changes global weather patterns in a 
phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect 
if you could stop the use of cfcs you stop two major evils 
ridley said this week 
the compounds invented in 1930 are widely used in refrigerator 
coolants foam insulation fastfood packaging solvents and 
propellants for aerosol spray cans 
thirtyone countries have agreed to reduce chlorofluorocarbon 
emissions by 50 percent by the end of the century 
on thursday ministers of the european economic community decided 
to empower the 12nation bloc to seek a complete ban by 1999 
britain has already vowed to halve its emissions by the end of 
this year and to reduce total emissions by 85 percent by 1999 
several countries including the united states have banned the 
use of the compounds in aerosol propellants and prime minister 
margaret thatcher said thursday that britain will soon require all 
new refrigerators to contain substances that would not harm the 
ozone layer 
britain will lobby other nations to follow suit ridley said 
emphasis will be placed on developing countries such as india and 
china which are gearing up for mass production of refrigerators and 
other consumer goods containing the compounds he said 
the conference to be opened by kenyan president daniel arap moi 
will hear first from scientists studying ozone depletion then from 
industrialists developing safe alternatives for some compounds 
the big race now is on in industry because the first industry 
that can produce cfcfree products has the world as its oyster 
said lord caithness a junior environment minister 
government officials and ministers will conclude the conference 
by discussing proposals to reduce the compounds ridley said mrs 
thatcher an oxford universityeducated chemist will address the 
conference and william reilly designated head of the environmental 
protection agency will represent the united states 
the compounds and related chemicals known as halons which are 
used in firefighting equipment can last more than 100 years they 
are stable and nontoxic at lower levels but when they reach the 
stratosphere 1525 miles up they are broken up by ultraviolet 
radiation and their chlorine atoms destroy the ozone 
over the antarctic an ozone hole an area where ozone has been 
seriously depleted is worsening according to the british 
governments stratospheric ozone review group the group reported 
that ozone concentration was reduced by more than 95 percent in some 
parts 
an international expedition warned in february that the 
atmosphere over the arctic region is also primed for a large 
destruction of ozone 
the us national aeronautics and space administration reported 
last year that annual ozone depletion over the northern hemispheres 
midlatitudes is also much higher than thought the protective 
shield appears to have shrunk by about 23 percent since 1969 over 
the area which includes most of the united states and canada nasa 
said 
scientists have also warned that a thinning of the ozone layer 
would increase the numbers of skin cancers according to the 
greenpeace environmental group each 1 percent depletion is 
estimated to increase the incidence of skin cancers by around 4 
percent 
ridley said the london conference will end without a formal 
agreement or signed declaration but we want them to accept the 
political urgency of cooperating worldwide 
we are trying to get everybody to sign up to the concept that 
we should get rid of them as soon as possible

the soviet unions ambassador casting his 
country in a mediators role said thursday that the furor over 
salman rushdies novel the satanic verses was extremely 
dangerous and depended for a solution on respect for everyones 
religious feelings 
these are general human rights and they should be respected 
yuri v dubinin the soviet ambassador said at a news conference in 
which he steered clear of the widespread condemnation of iranian 
death threats against the author 
but he stressed that the soviets feel the whole situation is 
very very dangerous and that in trying to defuse it the skill 
the science the art is to be balanced and to avoid all kind of 
conflicts 
dubinin acknowledged there was widespread condemnation of the 
threats by the ayatollah ruhollah khomeini and other iranian clerics 
who consider the novel to be heretical to islam but he said 
actions and reactions are very very dangerous and we think also 
that if we continue not to be active it would be very harmful to the 
whole atmosphere 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze paid a recent 
visit to tehran relations with moscow which iran had denounced in 
the past along with the united states as the great satan 
are improving 
dubinin fielding questions for more than an hour also said 
secretary of state james a baker iii probably would visit the 
soviet union in late april or early may 
the soviet ambassador said he hoped arrangements would be made 
next week in vienna at a meeting between baker and shevardnadze 
prior to the opening of new arms control negotiations between the 
north atlantic treaty organization and the warsaw pact 
it will be their first meeting and dubinin said we hope it 
will serve to establish a good personal contact and pave the way to 
a visit to the soviet union 
the soviet diplomat said ussoviet relations had improved and 
we shall not be found wanting in further moves to reduce 
tensions there is a strong realization that military solutions 
are not possible dubinin said 
on another subject dubinin renewed a soviet offer to restore 
diplomatic ties with israel after a 22year break if israel agreed 
to negotiations with the palestine liberation organization 
he urged un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar to 
appoint a special mediator to spur talks on the arabisraeli 
conflict and dubinin said the middle east should be declared a zone 
free of nuclear and chemical weapons as well as terrorism 
in the twoweek furor over the rushdie book baker has publicly 
denounced the threats as regrettable while charles e redman 
the state department spokesman called them abhorrent 
on wednesday redman said the state department had asked 
shevardnadze before he went to tehran to raise concerns with the 
iranians referring to the public outcry redman said we believe 
its high time the soviets speak up 
at the same time the us spokesman seemed to question the 
soviets diplomatic intercession as far as one can see there is 
nothing here that involves mediation redman said what is 
required is a condemnation of a death threat its clearly 
unacceptable and shouldnt exist 
dubinin said shevardnadze would discuss the situation in moscow 
with spanish foreign minister francisco fernandezordonez who will 
meet with him in behalf of the 12nation european community and 
then in vienna with baker and other foreign ministers 
our position is that the situation is viewed in the soviet 
union with concern dubinin said unless a reasonable solution 
is found the consequences could be unpredictable

an arbitrators ruling barred georgia power co 
from randomly testing 6400 electrical workers for drug use but said 
the company may be allowed to randomly test employees with 
particularly dangerous jobs 
arbitrator richard bloch said the decision tuesday is the first 
such ruling to affect a utility companys employees other than those 
working in nuclear power plants 
the ruling was in response to a complaint last fall by the 
international brotherhood of electrical workers the complaint made 
to the national labor relations board was referred to binding 
arbitration 
howard winkler georgia powers coordinator of labor relations 
said the company would evaluate all jobs and decide which jobs are 
dangerous enough to justify drug screening 
however union attorney j michael walls said any new policy 
would likely be challenged again 
the company began random urinalysis tests of its 2600 
supervisors in december and was to start screening the rest of its 
workers wednesday but the company will now postpone the program for 
the 6400 unionized workers covered by the decision and the 6000 
other employees who were not winkler said

the commander of moslem units in the 
lebanese army which like the country is divided on sectarian lines 
says he will send a mechanized infantry battalion to fight israel in 
the south 
maj gen sami khatibs intention to dispatch the 500 soldiers 
friday represented a policy shift by the military which has kept 
out of israels battle with palestinian and moslem guerrillas in 
south lebanon where israel occupies a strip of land just north of 
its frontier 
israel is much stronger than we are we dont have the weapons 
israel has we dont have their technology and their army outnumbers 
us but we should confront israel he said in an interview 
wednesday at his home in moslem west beirut 
khatib commands about 22000 soldiers based in moslem territory 
south of beirut and along the coast and gen michel aoun has 20000 
christian troopers in christian territory north and east of the 
capital 
the army divided when moslem militias drove christian units from 
west beirut in february 1984 nine years into lebanons sectarian 
civil war aoun technically commanded the entire army however 
until a dispute over the presidential succession created two 
governments last fall 
khatib 55 did not say whether his troops would initiate action 
against the israelis but indicated they would have a greater part 
in defensive operations when the israelis and their predominantly 
christian surrogate militia penetrated beyond the border security 
zone 
although army units have been caught in crossfire several times 
the lebanese military has not fought a major engagement with israel 
for more than 16 years 
we have our strong belief in our homeland khatib said we 
have our dignity and we should honor our belonging to the arab 
nation we should confront israel 
this doesnt mean that we have to commit suicide but we cant 
be indifferent toward israel well fight and try to hamper the 
enemys advance as much as we can 
he declared with a shake of his fist for emphasis this is our 
destiny as we see it 
khatib said he was moving the reinforcement battalion to south 
lebanon to support the approximately 3000 soldiers deployed in the 
area 
i expect an israeli operation at any time said the general 
a former inteligence officer who trained in the united states in 
1967 the lebanese army can only regain its confidence and justify 
its existence by confronting our traditional enemy israel 
lebanons military split became complete when president amin 
gemayels sixyear term ended with no successor elected because 
rightwing christians opposed candidates chosen by syria the 
countrys main power broker 
christian and moslem governments emerged from the crisis with 
the christian cabinet led by aoun a maronite catholic chosen by 
gemayel as caretaker prime minister when his term expired 
moslems refused to accept aouns authority and acting prime 
minister salim hoss a sunni who heads the moslem cabinet appointed 
khatib commander of moslem army units 
by longstanding agreement lebanons president is christian the 
prime minister sunni moslem and the parliament speaker shiite 
syria which has 40000 soldiers stationed in lebanon supports 
khatibs command 
in the interview khatib said his troops would coordinate with 
the un interim force in lebanon the peacekeepers sent to south 
lebanon to implement security council resolution 425 
the resolution was passed after israeli forces withdrew from 
lebanon in 1978 after an invasion intended to crush palestinian 
guerrillas it calls for unconditional withdrawal of israeli forces 
and deployment of the 5800 peacekeepers along the border 
the un forces whose operational area overlaps the israeli 
buffer zone have not been able to patrol the border because israel 
refuses to pull back 
israel invaded again in june 1982 and established the security 
zone which ranges in depth from six to 10 miles when its army 
withdrew three years later 
moslem army units are based in the southern coastal towns of 
sidon zahrani and tyre their closest positions to the israelis are 
around zaghdraya about 12 miles north of the zone 
the lebanese army did not resist the invasions its last major 
clash with israel was in september 1972 when it faced tank columns 
chasing palestinian guerrillas in south lebanon thirteen lebanese 
soldiers were killed

the us army said thursday it is 
baffled by the disappearance of a good cleancut american 
soldier who had access to classified information and vanished near 
the east german border 
an army spokesman lt col jake dye said there was not enough 
information to say if spec 4 michael a peri had defected dye 
acknowledged a portable computer was missing from an intelligence 
office where peri worked 
peri of laguna niguel calif has been listed as absent 
without leave since he failed to show up for work feb 21 at the 
11th armored cavalry regiment in fulda 65 miles northeast of 
frankfurt 
two days later officials searching for peri found his us army 
vehicle undamaged near the border town of obersuhl about 35 miles 
northeast of fulda 
peri was authorized to drive the vehicle and had logged it out 
properly dye said 
stars and stripes the armys unofficial newspaper quoted dye as 
saying the circumstances of that vehicle being found so close to 
the border are definitely suspicious 
dye told the associated press later the newspaper was putting it 
a little too strongly but he didnt deny making the statement 
peri worked as an electronics warfare signal specialist and was 
responsible for operating equipment that identifies and locates 
noncommunications signals such as radar he has been stationed in 
west germany since march 4 1988 
asked about the possibility peri defected dye said we 
certainly have no reason to believe that there were no signs of 
distress according to his colleagues and family we just dont have 
any indications 
peri had an active normal social life and a perfect record 
as a good cleancut soldier dye said 
in fact he had been promoted and nominated for soldier of the 
month twice in the year he has been here dye added thats 
what makes it so baffling from all indications everybody in his 
unit has the same feelings theyre all very surprised 
dye confirmed the stars and stripes report that a portable 
computer was missing from the office where peri had worked but dye 
said peri had not progressed very far in computers except for 
basic word processing 
a search of peris living quarters showed he had left his 
personal belongings behind dye said 
the spokesman said investigators are looking into all 
possibilites including foul play 
in march 1987 former us pvt wade e roberts defected with his 
west german girlfriend to the soviet union from a us army unit in 
giessen about 40 miles north of frankfurt roberts returned to the 
united states in november 1987 and was courtmartialed as a deserter

four months after voters passed official 
english amendments in colorado arizona and florida the effect is 
far from clear with supporters and opponents remain split over the 
measures legal meaning 
in arizona a state employees lawsuit challenging the 
constitutionality of the amendment is pending in us district court 
the author of the colorado amendment has criticized the governor 
and denvers mayor for issuing executive orders directing that 
bilingual government information still be provided theres also a 
lawsuit filed by opponents pending seeking to get the measure 
thrown out on technical grounds 
in florida the furor has subsided somewhat since a miamiarea 
grocery clerk was fired for speaking spanish in front of customers 
the store agreed to rehire the clerk and the legislature has taken 
no steps to pass laws to put the ballot measure into effect 
all this law has done is take support away from other issues 
that really need it said dorothy j porter director of the 
colorado civil rights division we should be spending money to 
improve relations between the races and i dont think this has done 
that 
the colorado measure which won the approval of 64 percent of 
voters asked simply shall there be an amendment to the colorado 
constitution to delare that the english language is the official 
language of the state of colorado 
supporters believe that means official government business should 
be conducted in english and say the amendment could be be used as 
ammunition in lawsuits aimed at changing private conduct such as 
employers who require spanish language facility for some jobs they 
say the law is necessary because of complaints from some people that 
their rights were being violated because they could not speak a 
foreign language 
opponents say the law is unclear and unnecessary they see it as 
an attack on their heritage and fear it will force them to renounce 
their language and learn english 
colorado attorney general duane woodard said i have no idea 
what that law means 
the amendment is very short it says english is the official 
language of colorado if thats the case what about federal laws 
that override it he asked federal laws limit discrimination 
against minorities in such areas as housing and jobs and 
requirement some government documents such as ballots to be 
multilingual 
opponents say there have already been several incidents in which 
citizens took the law into their own hands and tried to enforce it 
porter said there was the public school bus driver in grand junction 
who ordered children to stop speaking spanish and the fastfood 
restaurant worker who was fired for translating a menu into spanish 
but state rep barbara phillips who led the campaign to pass the 
amendment in colorado says those were regrettable 
misunderstandings that had nothing to do with official english 
those things happened before the amendment was passed and they 
will continue to happen she said our concern is with 
government actions our amendment was designed to prevent 
discrimination not cause it 
phillips says the measure has been a success because there have 
been no major complaints of discrimination since it was passed 
but she has accused colorado gov roy romer and denver mayor 
federico pena the citys first hispanic mayor of violating their 
responsibilities by issuing executive orders that bilingual 
government information still be provided 
that was the whole purpose of the amendment in the first 
place she said sixtyfour percent of the people in this state 
said they dont want that we want to make sure the governor 
complies with the constitution 
pena who issued an executive order warning city officials that 
the issue is potentially dangerous said the purpose of the 
executive order was to make sure no one was the victim of 
discrimination 
if the sponsors of the englishonly initiative find that 
troubling then that means the commitment and promises they made 
during their campaign were not correct pena said during their 
campaign they said the amendment was not to discriminate against 
anyone or deprive them of their rights but only to ensure that some 
other language would not be made the official one 
floridas measure passed by an overwhelming majority even though 
it was opposed by most state officials from the governor on down 
the measure empowers the legislature to implement it but so far 
there has been no enacting legislation without such a measure the 
amendment has no legal effect 
however the florida amendment also has caused problems a 
miamiarea grocery store clerk lost his job for speaking spanish in 
front of customers the store eventually agreed to rehire him 
because of negative publicity 
in arizona the official english measure is more specific but 
also contains broad exceptions it calls for state and local 
government actions and documents to be in english except for 
certain cases such as to comply with federal laws to protect rights 
of criminal defendants and victims of crime and to protect public 
safety 
within days of passage a state employee challenged the arizona 
measures constitutionality in a lawsuit claiming she feared she 
could be disciplined if she spoke spanish while working a state 
legislator later joined the suit saying the law could prevent him 
from communicating with his constituents in spanish the lawsuit is 
pending although the state has asked a judge to dismiss it 
phillips said the purpose of official english is not to divide 
the community but to unite it behind a common language 
thats not divisive thats unity its the law she 
said after all we won

because they have no food clothes and medical care the rev 
francis exavi ocaya was quoted as saying by the newspaper munno on 
thursday 
munno said ocaya who works in northern uganda was speaking at 
wednesdays opening session of church information officials from 
ugandas 14 dioceses in entebbe about 17 miles south of kampala 
bishop joseph mukwaya speaking at the same meeting appealed to 
all ugandans regardless of their faith to send food to the 
displaced people whom he described as brothers and sisters in 
need

after peace had been restored only to find their homes crops and 
granaries had been destroyed in fighting between president yoweri 
musevenis troops and the rebels

rebel holy spirit movement in november officials have acknowledged

spirit movement in 1986 government troops halted her poorly 
equipped warriors southward march a year later she fled to kenya

the environmental protection agency again asked 
congress thursday for authority to act faster in ordering dangerous 
pesticides off the market 
john moore acting deputy epa administrator told the house 
agriculture committees government operations subcommittee that he 
frequently hears remarks made in a tone of incredulity about epa 
pesticide decisions such as you want to cancel its use but cant 
get around to it for four years 
weve got to find a process that can be done in real time the 
current process doesnt comport with real time moore said 
repeating a complaint by the agency that current law permits 
excessive delays in regulatory actions 
currently the agency proposes pesticide actions for public 
comment receives comment for a month or two studies the comments 
and comes to a final decision this can take 15 to 18 months 
the licenseholder typically the manufacturer may appeal to 
an administrative hearing and then to the federal courts though 
use restrictions are frequently accepted by manufacturers orders to 
end use are almost always appealed 
during those hearings which may last years the pesticide stays 
on the market and the hearing officer does not build upon what 
has gone before moore said forcing epa and all other parties to 
start over from square one 
epa could declare an emergency and force an immediate end to use 
but the data rarely show a large enough danger to justify it he 
said 
excuse the pun but the registrant gets three bites at the 
apple the comment period the agency hearings and the courts 
moore said 
the subcommittee and its parent committee included a streamlined 
hearing process in a proposed overhaul of pesticide law two years 
ago but set the topic aside as too controversial in last years 
package of changes 
that package did eliminate one bar to emergency action by 
dropping the requirement that epa buy up inventories when its rare 
emergency bans are imposed 
rep george e brown jr dcalif who heads the subcommittee 
and rep pat roberts of kansas the senior republican member were 
sympathetic to moores complaints roberts said he soon would 
introduce legislation 
moore took the opportunity of his testimony to denounce again a 
study by the natural resources defense council released monday that 
said pesticide residues on food pose a significant risk of cancer 
for young children at the time the agency said it was taking into 
account the facts of young diets that the group said it was ignoring 
some calls to the agency from parents border on hysteria 
moore said 
in my opinion the public is being misled by the ominous 
rhetoric of these reports its way out of proportion to 
reality 
he said a detailed examination of the nrdc work showed that the 
group had used in its calculations outofdate residue and other 
data for one pesticide that epas independent scientific advisers 
judged useless for estimating risk epa estimates the risk of this 
pesticide the apple growth regulator daminozide at only 1 percent 
of what nrdc estimates and half the difference in estimates is 
accounted for by the outofdate data 
the agency has said it expects in 18 months or so to order a ban 
on daminozide which it has been studying since 1979 because of its 
cancercausing potential

stonehenge the ancient monument that is thronged 
with latterday druids every summer will be closed to the public 
for the summer solstice it was announced thursday 
english heritage said it was taking the action reluctantly on the 
advice of police who have had to cope with thousands of rowdy 
celebrants each june 
it is like closing westminster abbey at christmas protested 
rollo maughfling arch druid of the glastonbury order 
francis golding head of english heritage properties said 
stonehenge would probably be closed for 24 hours 
in the last 10 years the problems associated with convoys of 
travelers have disrupted the salisbury plain last year 1300 police 
were involved in a 700000 operation to escort and restrain the 
celebrants who call themselves hippies there were 67 arrests and 
10 injuries on the day of the solstice 
wiltshire chief constable walter girven said any convoys of 
travelers entering the county would be warned there was nowhere for 
them to go if they persisted in gathering near stonehenge they 
would be arrested he said 
unfortunately over the last 10 years there has been an 
increasing amount of violence occuring at the occasion of the 
solstice girven said 
the solstice has been used as an excuse for moving into the 
county camping illegally committing offenses and creating a 
considerable amount of disturbance to the inhabitants of wiltshire 
maughfling called the decision a gross violation of religious 
freedom 
he said his group intended to seek a judicial review and take the 
issue to the european commission of human rights 
they were also taking legal advice on whether a private action 
against the authorities would be possible 
we and other members of the druid orders of great britain feel 
that a great mistake may well be made here and leading to much worse 
consequences than keeping the monument open maughfling said 
closing stonehenge we feel will only add fuel to the fire 
inciting further unnecessary violence at even greater cost to both 
tax and ratepayer

a newspaper said today that state department 
officials have held secret talks with guerrillas in el salvador in 
an attempt to resolve the conflict in that country us officials 
denied the report 
spains leading daily el pais also said state department 
officials and representatives of the leftist farabundo marti 
national liberation front or the fmln will meet again this week in 
washington the paper based its report on unidentified sources in el 
salvador and mexico 
the united states does not have talks or negotiations with the 
fmln state department spokesman charles redman said in 
washington the united states supports el salvadors government in 
its 9yearold war with the front 
el pais correspondent antonio cano quoted the sources as saying 
the talks began in january and were the first between us officials 
and the guerrilla leaders since the war began it said the talks had 
substantially influenced recent developments in el salvador 
but the report said the talks did not solve the conflict in part 
because of president bushs lack of a clear foreign policy in 
central america 
redman said the united states maintains contacts with all 
political parties in el salvador he noted that a leftist 
presidential candidate guillermo ungo has been in washington this 
week for talks with administration officials and congressional 
leaders 
the paper said the first contacts took place in washington from 
jan 2023 between middlelevel guerrilla leaders and members of the 
bush administration and congress the paper said the guerrillas 
promised they would no longer consider us interests in el salvador 
military targets 
state department officials said the el pais report apparently 
referred to an appearance by fmln representatives at the department 
six weeks ago when they dropped off a peace proposal the department 
officials read the document asked for some clarifications then 
told the visitors they should discus it with the salvadoran 
government said the officials who asked not to be identified 
they said there have been no contacts with the fmln since then

students strickter safety monitoring also was ordered 
to some extent they must have learned their lesson said 
mireckis sister lynn johansen of appleton 
she and other relatives have filed a 20 million claim against 
the navy accusing officials of intentionally inflicting emotional 
distress by first reporting the drowning as an accident and of 
negligence in letting mirecki continue the class even though he had 
been diagnosed as having a phobia about being held under water 
the claim is intended to make the navy more responsive ms 
johansen said were just trying to make sure that it doesnt 
happen again 
criminal charges were filed against six navy men one instructor 
was convicted of negligent homicide and sentenced to 90 days in the 
brig while four other people were given administrative punishments 
of fines or rank reductions 
the officer in charge of the school was acquitted of dereliction 
of duty in a separate courtmartial but his commanding officer was 
given a letter of reprimand just prior to retiring 
since the changes were made last june 187 students have 
graduated with 18 more scheduled to complete the course friday said 
capt jw dickson who became commanding officer of the naval 
aviation schools command after mireckis death 
we think the quality of the students is every bit as good 
dickson said 
but attorneys at the courtmartials had argued that nowbanned 
practices including physically forcing scared or tired students to 
participate in drills was necessary for realistic training to make 
students ready for emergencies navy rescuers must be prepared to 
jump from hovering helicopters to rescue pilots downed at sea 
no real assessment can be made until new graduates are required 
to make rescues dickson said 
but most have only recently reached their duty stations and 
statistics show only about half of the navys 1200 rescue swimmers 
make a single rescue every three years dickson said the rest of 
the time they do other work while awaiting an emergency call

former sen barry goldwater accused john 
towers senate critics of hypocrisy thursday claiming thered be 
no government if everyone guilty of drinking or womanizing was run 
out of town 
people who live in glass houses should never throw rocks the 
always outspoken goldwater told reporters after he met with 
president bush and discussed the troubled tower nomination 
there are some strange things going on down in that old 
senate said the former arizona senator who retired in 1986 after 
a career spanning more than three decades 
goldwater who served with tower on the armed services committee 
and chaired the panel in 1985 and 1986 said that no one had yet 
come forth with proof that tower had ever been incapacitated with 
alcohol 
yeah he drank i had a few with him goldwater said that 
he chased a few women hearsay i dont give a damn whether he did 
or not but i dont like the senate working on innuendo on facts 
that have never been proven 
ive been around this town a long long time if they chased 
every man or woman out of this town who shacked up with somebody 
else or gotten drunk thered be no government so i think that the 
senate better start looking at facts 
the 1964 republican presidential candidate voiced particular 
displeasure with sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed 
services committee and a leading opponent of towers nomination 
im amazed at sam nunn im one of those republicans who had 
been hoping hed run for president but to come out as he has 
against tower and only on the basis of drinking i cant believe 
it 
im frankly shocked that they could allow partisan politics 
creep into this thing he added 
i would say theres a lot of hypocrisy in it goldwater said 
if they start investigating 100 members of that senate as 
theyve investigated john tower you people are going to have a 
ball goldwater told reporters outside the white house

americans cannot make up for poor dietary 
habits by loading up on megavitamins and other food supplements from 
the drug store experts said thursday at a national research council 
conference 
all of the money that people are spending on these dietary 
supplements would be far better spent on making better food choices 
thats the bottom line said anthony b miller a university of 
toronto nutrition scientist who headed an nrc committee that studied 
the issue 
theres little indication that they dietary supplements are 
doing harm but theres no proof that they are doing the good that 
people hope they will he said vitamins are not an adequate 
substitute 
miller said though some people are comforted by their belief that 
vitamin pills fiber powders or calcium tablets correct any 
nutrition deficit in their diet this may be a false sense of 
security 
he was elaborating on a study released wednesday by the national 
research council soundly rejecting the concept of taking food 
supplements such as vitamins fiber or calcium to make up for 
deficits in the diet manufacture and sale of such supplements is a 
3 billion business the study said and up to 60 percent of 
americans take such supplements 
in the councils 1300page report a 19member committee of 
experts said they found no proof that such supplements actually 
provided a health benefit for people on the average american diet 
instead said miller the diet itself is the problem 
the committee called for americans to cut their fat consumption 
to 30 percent of all calories consumed reduce cholesterol intake to 
300 milligrams and eat more complex carbohydrates vegetables and 
fruits 
if you change your diet in the direction that we recommend you 
will not need these vitamins said miller 
dr dewitt s goodman of columbia university a member of the nrc 
committee said he was particularly concerned about people taking 
vitamins in huge doses 
under no circumstances should americans take megadoses of 
anything he said that is highly undesirable that we strongly 
recommend against 
large doses of some vitamins can be poisonous said goodman 
goodman conceded that vitamin pills do have uses for some people 
but he said they are not needed by the general population and 
certainly not 60 percent of all americans 
individuals who for some reason have diets that do not meet 
their individual needs then multivitamins might be appropriate but 
that should be dealt with through a health professional said 
goodman 
even days when a persons only food is just a quick sandwich 
said goodman are not a reason to take vitamin pills or other 
supplements 
there is an enormous cushion in these rda recommended dietary 
allowances to allow for not meeting the requirement for one day or 
two days or three days he said 
goodman miller and other members of the nrc committee said what 
is important is the pattern of foods that a person eats the 
studies they said show that healthful and diseasecombatting 
effects come from diets that include a variety of foods not from 
concentrating on certain elements such as vitamins fiber or calcium 
the comments came during a conference of nutrition experts 
assembled to discuss the nrc report 
elaine lanza a scientist in the cancer prevention branch of the 
national cancer institute praised the position taken by the 
committee 
people need fruits vegetables and whole grains in their diets 
not supplements she said

space shuttle managers met thursday 
for two days of discussions to select a launch date for space 
shuttle discovery 
an announcement is expected friday afternoon 
nasa officials said wednesday the launch of discovery and its 
five astronauts would be delayed until at least march 11 because of 
a crushed electrical part on one of the shuttles three main engines 
until then the space agency had been targeting march 9 for 
liftoff but that date became questionable monday when the air force 
announced that it planned to launch a highpriority military rocket 
on that date and could not support a shuttle flight with its 
tracking facilities until the 11th 
the electrical part problem apparently resolved that potential 
conflict however a delay in the military flight could affect the 
shuttle launch on a daybyday basis 
the air force mission believed to be a satellite launch for the 
strategic defense initiative has priority for national security 
reasons 
during a readiness test of discoverys three main engines a 
control mechanism on engine no 1 shut down prematurely nasa said 
the problem was traced to a crushed solenoid a coil of wire that 
acts like a bar magnet when carrying an electrical current 
officials believe the solenoid was damaged when hit by equipment 
being used to install a new turbopump in the engine 
a replacement part was flown here and installed late wednesday 
the installation and checkout meant a slip of at least two days in 
the shuttle launch nasa said 
during five days in orbit discoverys astronauts are to deploy a 
large communications satellite and conduct scientific experiments

soviet jews staged their first protest in half a 
year thursday gathering within sight of the kremlin to accuse their 
government of violating international human rights agreements by 
barring their emigration 
a police major repeatedly told about 20 protesters they were 
breaking the law by holding a demonstration without a permit but 
uniformed and plainclothes officers who swarmed around the steps of 
lenin library made no move to halt the halfhour protest 
were hearing many words about how we are observing the vienna 
human rights agreements but they are not being fulfilled in 
deeds said protest organizer yuri semenovsky who has sought for 
three years to obtain a soviet exit visa we have been deceived 
semenovsky and other refuseniks who unfurled signs and banners at 
6 pm on the library steps within sight of the kremlins towers 
said soviet jews had not demonstrated for six months because of 
hopes raised by increased emigration figures and the vienna 
negotiations that resulted in a 35nation agreement on human rights 
in january 
but for us nothing has changed semenovsky said 
although more than 20000 soviet jews were allowed permission to 
emigrate in 1988 semenovksy said 80000 others had their 
applications refused 
he and the other demonstrators are members of a jewish refusenik 
group called the poor relatives who say their departure is 
prevented because of a soviet requirement that family members 
certify that they have no financial claims on a wouldbe emigrant 
he said 700 people were members of the poor relatives 
the group says such a requirement violates the vienna agreement 
adopted by the soviet union which mandates that acts or omissions 
by members of the applicants family do not adversely effect the 
rights of the applicant to emigrate 
the document was adopted in january at a meeting attended by 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze and envoys from 34 
other nations including the united states it is not legally 
binding but the 35 nations who adopted it undertook to abide by it 
the uniformed police major who gave his name as lebedev walked 
up to the demonstrators seconds after they displayed their banners 
and signs one of which called for a world without missiles and 
refuseniks 
lebedev said authorities in moscows kiev district had refused to 
grant the protesters request for a demonstration permit and that 
the city had outlawed all demonstrations at the library and nearby 
kalinin prospekt once the frequent site of protests by dissidents 
i call on you to end this illegal demonstration lebedev said 
but semenovsky replied he had never received an answer to his 
request from city authorities for a demonstration permit which he 
said he sent by registered mail 12 days ago 
he told lebedev that president mikhail s gorbachev has said 
that everything thats not forbidden is to be allowed 
lebedev repeated his demand at least 10 times that the refuseniks 
end the protest then he walked away 
that treatment was in sharp contrast to the way police dealt with 
a refusenik demonstration in august which was broken up in two 
minutes seven jews who were denied permission to emigrate were 
sentenced to up to 10 days in jail or fined for holding an 
unauthorized protest 
semenovsky said two other protests held in september also ended 
with the arrest of participants 
semenovsky said the refuseniks decided it was time to protest 
again because a new law easing emigration requirements has not 
appeared he said refuseniks were promised such a law would be 
enacted last month by yuri reshetov a foreign ministry official who 
received a group of jews in january 
in february soviet authorities allowed 2236 jews to leave 
according to the genevabased agency that helps resettle them that 
figure marked the second straight monthly drop in emigration but 
was still sharply above the monthly average in 1988 according to 
the intergovernmental committee for migration 
the number of jews allowed to emigrate soared to an eightyear 
high of 3510 in december and dipped to 2616 in january last 
years exodus of soviet jews totaled 20082 the most since 1980

the sun will be partly obscured for millions of 
americans next wednesday morning the us naval observatory 
reported thursday 
residents of hawaii and about the western twothirds of the 
united states and canada will be able to see the eclipse which will 
be at its maximum at about 10 am pst according to the 
observatorys calculations 
for residents of alaska about 70 percent of the sun will be 
covered during the eclipse while less of the sun will be obscured 
for viewers in other areas according to astronomers at mcdonald 
observatory of the university of texas at austin 
the eclipse will occur as the new moon passes between the sun and 
the earth 
the amount of sun covered will vary widely the texas astronomers 
reported from the 70 percent obscured in alaska it will diminish to 
about half in the pacific northwest with 30 percent covered along a 
line from san diego in southern california to winnipeg in canada 
at the easternmost limit of the eclipse along a line from 
central texas through missouri illinois and michigan only a small 
dent will appear in the sun 
even though a portion of the sun is obscured during the eclipse 
astronomers and eye doctors warn against looking directly at the 
phenomenon staring at the sun for more than a couple of seconds can 
burn and scar the retina potentially leading to distorted vision or 
blindness 
for groups of people who want to watch astronomers recommend 
using a pinhole mirror system to cast an image of the sun on an 
indoor wall 
this can be done by cutting a onequarter inch hole in a piece of 
black paper and taping the paper over a small mirror 
open a southfacing window and use the mirror to reflect the 
suns image on the opposite wall of the room modeling clay can help 
hold the mirror in place the room should be as dark as possible 
the spot reflected on the wall is am image of the sun and it will 
show every aspect of the eclipse 
it is a good idea to experiment with the paper and mirror ahead 
of time trying out different sizes of holes in the paper a large 
hole makes for a fuzzy but bright image while a smaller hole makes 
it sharp but dim

violinist yehudi menuhin in bonn to be 
honored for promoting germanjewish reconcialition urged the world 
thursday to condemn current atrocities as well as hitlers slaughter 
of european jews 
we will not draw the lesson so long as we condemn only the 
nazis who should be condemned he said if we condemn them we 
must condemn by the same token many of the acts which are happening 
now in many other countries 
as examples the 72yearold musician mentioned torture and 
slaughter in parts of africa central america and south america 
and events in the middle east 
menuhin dressed in a gray cardigan wellworn trousers and a 
fading paisley tie spoke to the associated press in a cramped 
lounge during a break in rehearsals for a concert he will conduct 
saturday 
soon after world war ii menuhin came to germany on a benefit 
concert tour that included a heartwrenching performance for fellow 
jews and other survivors of the bergenbelsen death camp 
he also played for germans americans and concentration camp 
survivors in berlin in 1947 two years after the war ended 
on sunday west germanys societies for christianjewish 
cooperation will give him the buberrosenzweig medal for those 
performances and his efforts to bring about dialague between jews 
and christians the award established in 1968 commemorates the 
jewish philosophers martin buber and franz rosenzweig 
menuhin who was born in new york city and became a british 
citizen in 1985 spoke at length of the relationships among crimes 
against humanity from various historical epochs 
i think that however tragic terrifying unspeakably horrible 
the third reich was that a nation that feels guilty a nation that 
knows it has committed a crime is a nation better for that he 
said 
the only sad sad thing today is that the crimes are going on 
not in germany but in many other parts of the world and until we 
can look upon them as crimes of mankind collectively until we can 
rise above the condemning of one people we will never overcome 
these crimes 
unless we can join our neighbors in the act of sharing and 
of protecting our childrens future we will all be destroyed he 
said 
i feel we are living now in the last epoch of the caveman 
although i sometimes feel the caveman couldnt have been as horrible 
as the modern man because he probably only killed to survive like 
the animals do 
in his book unfinished journey published in 1977 menuhin 
recalled the performances he gave at bergenbelsen 
the inmates of the camp had been liberated some weeks earlier 
the prison huts burned down and the exprisoners transferred to the 
adjoining ss barracks which had among other comforts a theater 
he wrote 
men and women alike our audience was dressed in army blankets 
fashioned by clever tailors among them into skirts and suits no 
doubt the few weeks since their rescue had put a little flesh on 
their bones but to our unaccustomed eye they seemed desperately 
haggard and many were still in hospital 
he wrote of facing boos hisses and imprecations when he went 
to the deuttel center a berlin camp for displaced persons in 1947 
but of winning over the audience with the declaration 
we jews dont beg we work we are the best cobblers the best 
tailors the best doctors the best musicians thats what it means 
to be a jew i have come to germany to restore that image to show 
how false was hitlers caricature 
menuhins benefit tours also took him to italy austria hungary 
britain and the netherlands in 1946 and 1947 during the war he 
played more than 500 benefit for allied soldiers and the red cross

a bachelor who bought one of englands great 
mansions has unusual plans for the 300room estate on 83 acres 
hell live in it 
most owners of stately homes turn them into inns or tourist 
attractions wensley haydonbaillie said thursday he has saved 
wentworth woodhouse for posterity and will make it his private 
residence 
he bought the 18thcentury mansion in south yorkshire from his 
distant cousins the fitzwilliam family for an undisclosed price 
the fitzwilliams nearly sold the lease last year to a developer 
but when they learned of his plans to put a golf course on the deer 
park and turn the building into a hotel the deal fell through 
i am delighted to be able to secure the future of wentworth 
woodhouse haydonbaillie said in a joint statement with the 
fitzwilliam estate which represents the family 
haydonbaillie 45 is an economist and chairman of two 
companies optical and medical international plc and porton 
international plc 
to provide for the restoration and maintenance of the house 
haydonbaillie has created an endowment trust said the statement 
lord montagu of beaulieu chairman of english heritage the 
statefunded body for preserving historic houses and monuments 
described wentworth woodhouse as one of the greatest historic 
houses in england 
the securing of its permanent future as part of britains 
future will be welcomed by all as of outstanding importance said 
montagu who acted as an adviser to the deal 
the statement said wentworth woodhouse with its 660footlong 
facade is the largest classical house in england the building near 
rotherham in central england is unique in that the back facade is in 
the baroque style 
haydonbaillie told the daily telegraph he was unsure how many 
rooms his new home had saying it depends what you count as a 
room the estate official said there were about 300 rooms 
in calling it home haydonbaillie will follow in the footsteps 
of the earl of strafford minister to king charles i and the 
marquess of rockingham prime minister at the time of americas 
revolutionary war 
the statement hinted haydonbaillie wont keep the mansion 
entirely to himself saying he intends to allow appropriate access 
when and where possible after restoration 
the public will also be allowed to walk through the estates 83 
acres of parkland which is owned by a fitzwilliam family trust 
following postworld war ii legislation enacting heavy taxes on 
inherited wealth many owners of stately homes have been forced to 
open them to the public some turned over houses to the national 
trust charity while others turned them into museums with commercial 
attractions on the side and lived in one corner 
the historic houses association britains largest group of 
private owners doesnt criticize the commercial ventures 
using houses in this way is a way that collections can stay 
together and be viable under private ownership said victoria 
merrill executive secretary of the group the great thing is to 
have them used

william j bennett indicated thursday that he 
envisions a war on drugs against casual users as well as drug 
dealers but he assured senators that he would defend the civil 
liberties of americans 
the socalled casual user has to realize hes an accessory 
to everything thats going on in this country bennett nominated 
to become the first director of national drug control policy told 
the senate judiciary committee 
during the second and final day of his relatively uncontentious 
confirmation hearings bennett said he intends to enlist the help of 
such people as television writers and commissioners of sports 
leagues to change the countrys attitude on drug use 
he said hes bothered by sports announcers introducing a player 
on the field who has just returned from his third round of treatment 
for drug abuse 
how many shots do you get to still continue to appear as a role 
model to children bennett said 
committee chairman joseph r biden jr ddel scheduled a 
committee vote on the nomination next thursday only two senators 
howard metzenbaum dohio and paul simon dill have indicated 
they might vote against bennett 
the former education secretary called for a hard line against 
drug traffickers and defended his support of school officials who 
set up metal detectors and take other measures to control violence 
and drug abuse in the schools 
this war is not for delicate sensibilities he said this 
is tough stuff 
however he assured biden that he is concerned about civil 
liberties 
they are the base they are the cement they are the anchor 
they sometimes cause us difficulties in this war but these are 
the ends you cant destroy the fabric of the country in order 
to defend the country bennett said 
as education secretary he said i resisted some who were 
arguing for universal drug testing of the students because im 
sensitive to the constitution the fourth amendment which 
prohibits unreasonable search and seizure 
biden raised anew the issue of whether there should be a ban on 
semiautomatic combatstyle weapons used by drug traffickers the 
subject was debated extensively wednesday when sen edward m 
kennedy dmass pulled out a memo bennett wrote a year ago urging 
consideration of legislation limiting access to such weapons 
bennett told biden on thursday that he believes theres a 
correlation between easy access to weapons and the violence of drug 
dealing 
i dont think theres any doubt about it bennett said but 
added you still have to take the peoples right to bear arms 
seriously 
a host of drugrelated shootings and the killing of five 
california schoolchildren earlier this year have prompted calls for 
a ban on semiautomatic assault weapons with highcapacity ammunition 
clips president bush has said he opposed such regulation while 
mrs bush supports a ban 
bennett resisted taking a position on any specific legislation 
pending completion of a comprehensive national drug control strategy 
due six months after his confirmation but he left open the 
possibility that he ultimately may disagree with bushs position 
the fact that its been spoken about by the president does not 
mean its off the table he said adding that bush agrees with 
that view 
sen arlen specter rpa urged bennett to examine closely the 
state departments method of certifying countries overseas for 
foreign aid that department determines whether those countries have 
done all they can to battle illegal drugs and the list of certified 
countries issued wednesday included colombia the base of several 
notorious drug traffickers 
specter said the certification of colombia is a shock to me 
because colombia has refused to negotiate with us an extradition 
treaty in effect saying the drug cartels have taken over the 
country 
bennett said he would look into the certification procedures but 
defended the inclusion of colombia on the list 
the government in colombia has made some efforts he said 
we know what happened to the supporters of the extradition treaty 
they got most of the members of the supreme court blown away by 
machinegun fire 
specter said continuing foreign aid to colombia probably would 
encourage its antidrug efforts but i think we have to expect 
some results colombia is really in a state of anarchy how they 
can qualify for foreign aid is a mystery to me 
the hearing concluded after representatives of the league of 
united latin american citizens and the association for supervision 
and curriculum development offered testimony critical of bennetts 
nomination although a lulac spokesman said he believed committee 
approval of bennett was inevitable

the commerce department said thursday it has 
lifted export restrictions on a variety of goods and technology that 
had been controlled for national security reasons for more than 25 
years 
the technology and materials many of them commonly available 
now can be shipped out of the country without prior approval by the 
commerce department they include general industrial equipment such 
as lathes and presses photographic equipment servocontrol units 
synchronous motors and a broad range of industrial chemicals 
this brings our export controls more closely in line with those 
of our allies and improves the competitive position of us 
exporters said michael zacharia assistant secretary of commerce 
for export administration 
these changes focus controls on equipment with real potential 
for military use by our adversaries while at the same time reducing 
unnecessary burdens on american businesses that export technology 
products he said 
the action was required under the 1988 omnibus trade act which 
directed the commerce department to remove restrictions on items 
upon which only the united states imposed national security 
controls unless the united states was the only source or was 
seeking similar controls from its allies 
some items will continue to be controlled because of regulations 
related to nuclear nonproliferation and foreign policy concerns

solidarity leader lech walesa said thursday 
he is a bigger optimist after a meeting with the interior 
minister to iron out problems that have arisen during three weeks of 
negotiations 
the meeting came at a key moment in the unprecedented talks that 
began feb 6 between the government and the opposition aimed at 
reaching national accord and legalizing the banned solidarity union 
after more than seven years 
participants agreed the talks various committees and 
subcommittees should speed up their work allowing the final plenary 
meeting to be held in late march a joint statement said afterward 
then the process of implementing key decisions could start 
as soon as possible the statement carried by the official pap 
news agency said 
the two sides have brought their positions closer together in 
many areas although controversies and difficulties remain the 
statement said 
the meeting of walesa and interior minister gen czeslaw kiszczak 
began at 930 am at the magdalenka governement villa in a forest 
south of warsaw and ended after 6 pm walesa appeared weary but 
satisfied on his return to warsaw 
we were successful with some things and less successful with 
others he said but i hope that we are moving forward 
he said the session left him a bigger optimist than before i 
went to it 
according to the solidarity leader the meeting with kiszczak was 
to remove some barriers some political obstacles he 
declined to elaborate 
walesa was accompanied by advisers including historian bronislaw 
geremek journalist tadeusz mazowiecki union organizers zbigniew 
bujak and wladyslaw frasyniuk the rev alojzy orszulik and gdansk 
bishop tadeusz goclowski 
among those on the government side with kiszczak were deputy 
prime minister ireneusz sekula sports minister aleksander 
kwasniewski and communist party politburo member janusz reykowski 
after three weeks of talking both sides appear eager for 
agreement 
walesa faced with a rising tide of worker and student 
discontent has been traveling the country pleading with people to 
hold back protests and give the talks three more weeks to succeed 
although the talks have yielded progress in some areas including 
agreement in principle to legalize solidarity and the farmers 
independent union rural solidarity several sticking points have 
arisen including the form of upcoming elections to the sejm or 
parliament this year 
solidarity has accepted the notion that a majority of seats would 
be reserved for the party and its allies as a temporary step on 
the road to full democracy but it wants the rest to be freely 
contested the party would like to see the remaining seats assigned 
to oppositionindependent candidates 
another sore point is legalization of the banned independent 
students association students are increasingly agitated about the 
fate of the group known by the polish initials nzs 
authorities seem to regard nzs as a greater threat than 
solidarity or rural solidarity especially in light of the communist 
partys weak support among youth and have mounted a strong 
propaganda campaign against the group in the past week based on 
protests in krakow 
a group of krakow students met with local solidarity activist 
mieczyslaw gil on wednesday and asked him to speak up for nzs at the 
meeting with kiszczak 
at a meeting with students wednesday at warsaw university walesa 
said he would defend nzs no table can stand on less than three 
legs and those three legs are solidarity of workers nzs and rural 
solidarity he said 
nzs was banned along with solidarity and other independent groups 
after the dec 13 1981 martiallaw crackdown in poland 
the two sides also remain apart on creating a state presidency 
that would help guarantee continuation of a communist system in 
poland on the degree of oppositions access to the mass media and 
on the framework for an economic reform program

a college president who resigned after two male 
students accused him of sexual assault continues to draw a 63000 
salary while on extended salary despite being certified capable of 
returning to work 
former westfield state college president francis j pilecki plans 
to appeal the doctors ruling according to officials at fitchburg 
state college where pilecki worked after leaving westfield 
pilecki 55 was examined by a doctor at the request of the 
schools faculty union and was judged fit to return to work 
fitchburg spokesman michael shanley said 
pilecki went on sick leave in 1987 and has exhausted the benefits 
he was entitled to as a professor faculty members complain that now 
his pay is depleting a college sick bank which was created by 
deducting days from each employees unused sick time and pooling 
them for the use of colleagues suffering from extraordinary ailments 
under the appeal process pilecki will be examined by three 
doctors one of his choice one selected by the college and another 
agreed upon by the school and pilecki 
a grand jury indicted pilecki in 1986 and at trial he was found 
innocent of the sexual assault charge leveled by one student the 
remaining charges were dropped after a settlement was reached in a 
civil lawsuit brought by the other student

an electronics industry group said thursday it 
was urging largescale reentry by us companies into the global 
market for computer memory chips 
the initiative which could involve outlays of billions of 
dollars to regain a significant share of a market that up to now has 
been largely conceded to the japanese was announced by the board of 
the semiconductor industry association 
a stable and reliable source of drams dynamic randomaccess 
memory chips is essential to meet the critical technology needs of 
the us electronics and defense industries the group said in a 
statement 
it added that reentry of the us semiconductor industry into 
largescale dram production is important to the nations economic 
and security interests 
gordon moore of intel the boards chairman told a news 
conference that the initiative represented a significant and 
important change from the level of rhetoric weve had previously 
the action called for developing a plan and structure for 
recommended collective efforts by the us semiconductor industry 
asked whether that could mean formation of a consortium on the 
model of sematech moore said collective efforts could well 
involve something like consortia 
the board of the association which is based in cupertino 
calif also approved a resolution saying we request that access 
to the japanese semiconductor market be among the highest 
administration trade priorities 
it complained that the japanese are still failing to comply with 
marketaccess provisions of the september 1986 usjapanese 
semiconductor agreement under which tokyo agreed to boost american 
companies share of the japanese semiconductor market 
we express deep concern that foreign participation in the 
japanese market may be declining from already depressed levels 
the us electronics group said 
in april 1987 the us government imposed 300 million in tariff 
sanctions against japanese computers power tools and televisions 
seven months later 135 million of the sanctions were lifted after 
the japanese stopped dumping lowpriced computer chips in the united 
states and third countries

the mcdonnell douglas corp cemented its 
position as americas largest military contractor last year and 
california easily retained first place as the state receiving the 
most defense payroll and pension dollars pentagon officials said 
thursday 
releasing two annual reports that chart the flow of military 
dollars the officials said the st louisbased mcdonnell douglas 
widened its lead over no 2 general dynamics corp and no 3 general 
electric co by bucking a national trend and increasing its military 
business in fiscal 1988 
general dynamics and ge both saw their defense business drop last 
year the pentagon reported 
on the geographic front california easily maintained its top 
ranking receiving almost 13 billion in defense department payrolls 
and pensions that figure does not include the 235 billion in 
contracts won by california companies in fiscal 1988 for future 
business 
nationally the pentagon paid out 854 billion in payroll and 
pensions during the year to people working or retired inside the 
united states up 1 billion from the previous year 
of that total 273 billion went to pay civilian employees 
345 billion went to activeduty personnel 5 billion went to pay 
reservists and national guard members and 186 billion went to 
retirees 
the new figures are contained in two statistical reports 100 
companies receiving the largest dollar volume of prime contract 
awards and the department of defense atlas both cover the 
fiscal year that ended last sept 30 
last month the pentagon released a report that provided a 
breakdown of military contracts by state the list of rankings 
released thursday however is the first to show how individual 
companies fared during the year 
the atlas meantime shows how the pentagons payroll and 
military pensions are being dispersed around the nation 
according to the corporate rankings mcdonnell douglas received 
contracts worth 8 billion in fiscal 1988 up from 77 billion in 
fiscal 1987 and far ahead of general dynamics 
general dynamics saw its business decline from 7 billion in 
fiscal 1987 to 65 billion last year while ges business declined 
from 58 billion to 57 billion 
the remainder of the top 10 included tenneco inc with 51 
billion raytheon co with 41 billion martin marietta corp with 
37 billion general motors corp with 36 billion the lockheed 
corp with 354 billion the united technologies corp with 351 
billion and the boeing co with 3 billion 
the report shows the pentagons contractors were fighting over a 
smaller pie in fiscal 1988 with prime contracts totaling 137 
billion being parceled out that is 55 billion less than the total 
awarded in fiscal 1987 
moreover the top 100 companies as a group saw their share of 
those contracts decline last year the 100 firms received 901 
billion of the contracts or 658 percent of the total compared to 
954 billion and 669 percent in fiscal 1987 
the biggest change in the fiscal 1988 rankings was the rise of 
tenneco a company that ranked 13th in fiscal 1987 tennecos jump 
to fourth place was based on a navy order for two nuclearpowered 
aircraft carriers received by the newport news shipbuilding amp 
drydock co a wholly owned subsidiary 
as for the pentagons payroll and pension payments california 
was followed in the rankings by virginia with 92 billion in total 
compensation texas with 65 billion florida with 5 billion and 
north carolina with 32 billion 
the remainder of the top 10 included georgia with 31 billion 
washington state with 29 billion maryland with 27 billion 
pennsylvania with 25 billion and south carolina with 24 billion 
breaking down those figures to focus on pension payments 
military retirees most favor california florida texas virginia 
and washington state in that order

actor gary busey was sharply criticized by an 
injury control authority thursday for continuing to oppose 
motorcycle helmets even after receiving a serious head injury in a 
motorcycle crash 
mr busey is darn lucky to even be alive to make the statements 
he makes said dr jeffrey sacks a medical epidemiologist at the 
injury control division of the us centers for disease control in 
atlanta 
im assuming that he doesnt have residual brain damage that 
led to what he said sacks said 
each year 4000 people are killed in motorcycle accidents and 
360000 injured seriously enough to require medical care sacks said 
in a telephone interview 
busey who said he plans to help raise money to fight mandatory 
helmet laws met reporters wednesday for the first time since 
receiving a serious injury dec 4 that required brain surgery to 
remove two blood clots 
busey said that if he had been wearing a helmet he could have 
broken his neck 
sacks said im reminded of how people say wearing a seat belt 
may be dangerous because maybe ill get thrown clear of a car that 
gets crushed if i dont wear it 
i think the same kind of logic applies here there may be rare 
instances where wearing a helmet or wearing a seat belt may do harm 
but in the vast majority of situations theyre going to save lives 
sacks said the case is clear compelling and overwhelming that 
helmets reduce head injuries not only in motorcycling but also for 
many sports and even for bicycling 
in july dr frederick rivara of the university of washington in 
seattle reported that it costs an average of 25764 to care for a 
motorcyclist hospitalized for injuries sustained on a motorcycle 
rivara studied 105 hospitalized motorcyclists and found that 
public funds covered more than 63 percent of their 27 million in 
medical costs 
several studies have shown that a very high proportion of 
motorcyclists lack insurance to pay for their medical care which 
means taxpayers pay for it said sacks 
busey may well be able to afford his medical care and see that 
he gets the best but such is not the case for many of those who 
will suffer a serious head injury for which we the public will 
have to pay sacks said

south korea and north korea failed 
thursday to set terms for an unprcedented meeting between their 
prime ministers but both sides agreed to try again in april 
officials said 
the fivemember delegations exchanged hostile statements after 
north korea refused to withdraw demands for an immediate halt to 
annual joint ussouth korea military exercises 
they agreed to meet again on april 12 
korea showed no sincerity at all in considering our just 
proposal for an end to the exercises north koreas chief 
delegate paik nam jun said after the meeting 
the seoul delegation canceled a scheduled news conference and 
chief delegate song hanho said he had nothing to add to the 
meeeting which he described as selfexplanatory 
the meeting held at this border village 35 miles north of seoul 
was a repeat of the feb 8 talks which collapsed after the 
communist delegation made the same demands 
paik said there would be no progress toward a meeting between 
presidents of the two nations unless seoul agreed to cancel the 
maneuvers paik said the military exercises were preparation for a 
nuclear attack on the communist nation 
he said south korea could hold reduced exercises but without 
us participation and he said any american military units en route 
to south korea for this years maneuvers should turn back 
immediately 
song has said the exercises known as team spirit are 
defensive and no threat to north korea 
i urge that your side discuss procedural matters in a sincere 
manner for the sake of the early realization of a southnorth 
highlevel officials meeting he said 
the team spirit exercises have been conducted annually since 
1976 to test joint military preparedness in the event of a north 
korean attack north korea invaded south korea in 1950 starting a 
threeyear war 
the two nations archrivals since the division of their land 
have made efforts recently to improve relations although neither 
side so far has been willing to make substantial concessions

him for the 1989 nobel peace prize 
the protesters in voeroesmarty square denounced human rights 
abuses in neighboring czechoslovakia 
police did not interfere in the peaceful rally which has only 
recently become permitted in hungary 
writer gyoergy konrad compared the banning of havels books and 
his jail sentence to irans death threat against salman rushdie for 
his book the satanic verses 
the czech government must free vaclav havel from prison and 
the 1989 nobel peace prize should be given to him one speaker 
said to the cheers of the assembled crowd he said organizers of the 
rally would send the nomination to the nobel committee in norway 
havel was convicted last month on charges of incitement and 
obstructing police for his role in a january rally in prague and he 
was sentenced to nine months in jail the january rally honored jan 
palach a student who set himself afire to protest the sovietled 
invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 
organizers read a letter addressed to the czechoslovak embassy in 
budapest calling on the government in prague to adopt political 
reforms similar to those under way in hungary and poland 
a government that imprisoned a man who was taking flowers to 
the place where jan palach died cannot have a future in presentday 
europe the speaker said 
pictures of havel were pinned to loudspeaker cables throughout 
the square 
speakers also read letters sent to demonstration organizers by a 
czechoslovakian human rights group and by havels wife olga 
she thanked the protesters for their show of solidarity with 
her husband and with others who have been imprisoned or are 
persecuted for their views

congress celebrated its bicentennial on 
thursday with trumpets with poetry and reflecting the nature of 
the place with speeches galore 
the house of representatives and the senate of the united states 
gathered for a joint meeting in the house chamber for a ceremony 
calling attention to that latewinter day in 1789 when congress 
assembled for the first time in new york city eventually to breathe 
life into the newly ratified constitution 
actually thursdays session took place two days before the 
anniversary the 1st congress met on march 4 1789 but the actual 
anniversary falls on a saturday and the 101st congress will not be 
in session that day 
at the bicentennial celebration the mood was both serious and 
irreverent 
since reverence has never been americas thing this verse in 
your honor will not begin o thou said howard nemerov poet 
laureate of the united states reading a poem dedicated to congress 
as it begins its third century 
even some of the words about congress quoted in the printed 
program had an irreverent air 
congress is so strange a man gets up to speak and says 
nothing nobody listens and then everbody disagrees boris 
marshalov a soviet visitor in 1946 
we cuss congress and we joke about em but they are all good 
fellows at heart and if they wasnt in congress why they would 
be doing something else against us that might be even worse 
will rogers 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said that in the 
age of television the presidency is perceived by most americans as 
the primary branch of government 
i do not claim that congress is the primary branch of 
government mitchell said i do remind all it is a coequal 
branch 
david mccullough a prizewinning historian gave the principal 
address and sounded the same theme 
in contrast to the presidency he said congress seems to roll 
on like a river someone said you can never cross the same river 
twice congress is like that always there and always changing 
individuals come and go the stage is constantly crowded the 
talk and the rumpus go on and there has been a lot of humbug and so 
much that is overwhelmingly boring 
mccollough added congress for all its faults has not been the 
unbroken parade of clowns and thieves and posturing windbags so 
often portrayed what should be spoken of more often are the 
great victories that have been won here the decisions of courage 
and vision achieved the men and women of purpose and integrity 
and yes at time genius who have served here 
the first congress adopted the bill of rights the first 10 
amendments to the constitution established the supreme court and 
other divisions of the federal court system counted the first 
electoral ballots that seated george washington as the first 
president passed the first tariff legislation to provide an income 
for the federal government and created the structure and committees 
of both houses 
although that first congress convened on march 4 it took weeks 
for each chamber to gain a quorum april 1 for the house and april 6 
for the senate 
thursdays ceremony was a bit reminiscent of the initial 
difficulty congress had in assembling a quorum neither the 435seat 
house nor the senate had a quorum of its members present only 20 
of the 100 members of the senate were to be seen

the head of amtrak said thursday that the 
commuter railroad would continue limited operations for only a few 
days if picketed by workers supporting any strike against eastern 
airlines 
w graham claytor jr president of amtrak also said that if 
eastern is struck and sympathetic workers do not picket the 
railroad amtrak would add trains between new york and washington 
and possibly between new york and boston 
claytor told the senate transportation appropriations 
subcommittee that based on public statements by union leaders he 
considered it likely that a strike against eastern would result in 
picketing against the railroad by union members seeking to disrupt 
transportation 
outside the hearing room he told reporters that management 
personnel would operate the trains and that amtrak would be able to 
provide limited service on its routes for at least a day or two 
and then shut down altogether 
he said the railroad could not function for much longer because 
of rules regulating the number of hours railway employees can work 
asked which amtrak workers could be expected to cross a picket 
line he said nobody 
he said if there were no pickets against amtrak there would be 
three additional round trenvironment0347

environmental officials from the 12 
european economic community nations agreed thursday to sharply 
reduce their use of chlorofluorocarbons the compounds that are 
destroying the earths ozone layer 
the ministers agreed to cut chlorofluorocarbon production by 85 
percent as soon as possible and to seek a total ban on the synthetic 
substances by the end of the century 
chlorofluorocarbons are used in aerosal sprays refrigeration 
coolants and a variety of other products the compounds are blamed 
for depletion of the ozone layer that protects the earth from the 
suns harmful ultraviolet rays 
the ministers agreed to give the eec commission a mandate to 
completely phase out the manufacture and use of chlorofluorocarbons 
by the year 2000 
the commission will represent the 12 nations at the international 
conferences being held this year to discuss the ozone issue and 
monitor application of an international accord called the montreal 
protocol 
this protocol signed by 40 countries and ratified by 32 took 
effect on jan 1 and is intended to reduce the production and use of 
chlorofluorocarbons by 50 percent from current levels by 1998 
the eec ministers also gave a mandate to the commission to 
encourage other countries to sign and ratify the protocol 
the eec member states are responsible for about half the worlds 
annual chlorofluorocarbon production of 1 million tons with britain

the celebrity status of grammy 
awardwinning jazz saxophonist stan getz is worth little because of 
his ill health and his exwife is not entitled to any payment for 
it a judge has ruled 
in a decision rendered last month and made public thursday state 
supreme court justice nicholas colabella denied a motion by getzs 
exwife monica that his celebrity status constituted marital 
property 
getz gained gold record status with his 1966 hit the girl from 
ipanema 
according to the court papers getz 60 suffers from liver 
cancer lymphoma and cirrhosis of the liver 
getzs physician avram cooperman testified that getz probably 
has two years to live and it is unlikely plaintiff will be able to 
pursue his livelihood as a performer in any substantial way 
colabellas ruling came more than a year after getz was granted a 
divorce from his wife of 31 years in a trial in which the couple 
traded allegations of adultery and abuse 
getz an admitted alcoholic testified that his wife put 
antabuse a drug used in treating alcoholics into his food without

only to equal distribution of marital property including the sale 
of their 18 million tarrytown estate property in spain and 
royalties due for records made 1956 when the couple wed to 1981 
when getz filed for divorce

the air force said thursday it had imposed 
flight restrictions on 20 of its 50 new c5b galaxy cargo planes 
until a problem with the engine pylons is corrected 
the service said it had just recently identified a potential 
problem with some inboard engine pylons on some of the c5b fleet 
only 20 c5bs may be affected the service said we have 
found 31 pylons with this potential defect 
the issue had surfaced in public in a report by the delaware 
state news in dover del 
the pylon is the assembly that holds a jet engine to an 
airplanes wing in the case of the fourengine c5b the air force 
said the problem prompting the flight restrictions involved the 
pylons closest to the fuselage on each wing 
the service said in a statement the affected pylons had been 
manufactured differently than originally specified with the result 
that the overall useful life of the pylon had been reduced 
the problem pylons have metal sleeves or bushings at the point 
where the engine mounts to the pylon in order to ensure a tight 
fit the original design calls for directly attaching the engine to 
the pylon under such tight tolerances that a bushing is not needed 
because of the tolerances required these bushings may reduce 
the pylons useful life the service said for example instead 
of lasting 30000 flying hours the mount would only last 
15000to20000 hours 
the service described the flight restrictions as minor because 
they affect maximum performance standards that are rarely touched 
during peacetime training 
the restrictions include a reduction in maximum air speed from 
350 knots 400 mph to 300 knots 345 mph a taxi speed restriction 
of 25 knots 29 mph and orders to avoid sideslipping of the 
aircraft in flight and severe turbulence 
the prime contractor for the c5b is the lockheed corp and the 
air force said thursday it was working closely with the aircrafts 
manufacturer to resolve the problem 
dick martin a spokesman for lockheedgeorgia the subsidiary 
that makes the c5b in marietta ga said thursday the company was 
well aware of the situation and we will correct the problem 
martin said the bushings had been made for lockheed by a 
subcontractor rohr industries of chula vista calif and that 
lockheed and rohr would work together to resolve the matter at no 
cost to the air force 
my understanding is that the suggested fix will be to install a 
different style of bushing martin said adding the repairs might 
be completed in less than two months 
maj fran tunstall an air force spokesman in washington said 
the service did not have an estimate of the cost of fixing the 
pylons nor any timetable for the repairs 
but we do expect lockheed and rohr to make the repairs 
tunstall said 
dick dalton a spokesman for rohr agreed his company would be 
working with lockheed to correct the problem dalton also noted 
however that rohr industries does not have design responsibility 
for the c5 pylon

senators fired their opening volleys thursday 
in a partyline floor battle on john towers faltering nomination 
while the white house conceded that president bush has failed to 
convince a single democrat to support his chosen defense secretary 
not yet responded white house press secretary marlin 
fitzwater when asked to provide the name of one democrat the 
administration had won over after two days of intensive lobbying 
sen sam nunn dga the chairman of the armed services 
committee began the longawaited debate saying he was acting with 
a sense of sorrow in leading the opposition against his former 
colleague whom he had expected to support when the hearings began 
but the georgia democrat said towers record of alcohol abuse 
cannot be ignored 
were not talking about the secretary of interior were 
talking about someone next to the president at the very top of the 
nuclear chain of command nunn said 
sen john warner rva in rebuttal for the republicans 
extolled tower for incalculable contributions to the united 
states in 24 years in the senate and later service on an arms 
negotiating team 
he said 70 current senators served with tower and not one has 
come forward to challenge in any way the discharge of his duties as 
a united states senator not one 
in defense of the nomination sen william cohen rmaine urged 
his colleagues to weigh personal experience against the evidence 
presented to the senate armed services committee 
cohen described the evidence included in the fbi report on tower 
as so weak no prosecutor would even bring a case like this before 
a court of law 
the maine republican recalled allegations that surfaced about the 
personal lives of presidents john f kennedy and lyndon b johnson 
after their deaths and stressed that they failed to stop the two 
leaders from successfully guiding the nation 
did these character flaws prevent lbj from successfully pushing 
through some of the most important domestic legislation in the 
history of our country did they prevent jfk from forcing the 
missiles from out of cuba or negotiating a nuclear test ban 
treaty cohen said theres a double standard at work here 
meanwhile the ranks of opposition democrats continued to grow as 
sen terry sanford of north carolina a southern democrat the 
administration hoped to see in its corner said he would vote 
against the nomination sen alan cranston dcalif and sen paul 
sarbanes dmd also said they would oppose the nomination 
raising the number of opposition democrats to 39 
democrats hold a 5545 majority in the senate an associated 
press tally at showed 43 democrats and republican larry pressler of 
south dakota either solidly opposed or leaning in opposition and 40 
republicans either solidly for tower or leaning in favor of the 
nomination 
no senate vote is expected until next week 
despite the obvious numbers bush is still pleased with the 
candidate and still believes hes the best man for the job said 
fitzwater 
tower meanwhile met at the white house with bush adm william 
crowe and deputy defense secretary william h taft iv who is 
serving as acting defense secretary 
the nominee has been dogged by allegations of excessive drinking 
womanizing and questions about his ties to defense contractors over 
a 2 year period tower received more than 1 million in consulting 
fees from such defense industry giants as rockwell and martin 
marietta 
tower has said he has no intention of giving up the fight for 
confirmation and has vowed to give up drinking if he becomes defense 
secretary 
two wellknown republicans former sen barry goldwater and 
former president nixon weighed in with their support of the 
embattled nominee with the 80yearold goldwater issuing a 
blistering attack of his former colleagues 
the arizona republican who served in the senate for 29 years 
accused towers senate critics of hypocrisy and said that if 
everyone who was guilty of excessive drinking or womanizing was 
forced out the nation would have no government 
if they chased every man or woman out of this town who shacked 
up with somebody else or gotten drunk thered be no government so 
i think that the senate better start looking at the facts 
goldwater said following a white house meeting with president bush 
goldwater chided the senate for working on innuendo on facts 
that have never been proven 
yeah he drank i had a few with him goldwater said of 
tower that he chased a few women hearsay i dont give a damn 
whether he did or not 
nixon in a statement issued by his spokesman john taylor said 
unless there is conclusive evidence against the nominee the 
senate should respect the right of a new president to choose the men 
and women he believes are best qualified to serve in his cabinet 
some of the specific allegations against tower have surfaced in 
news reports the washington post on thursday quoted a retired air 
force sergeant as saying tower appeared drunk and fondled women on 
two visits to bergstrom air force base in texas in 1976 and 1978 
fitzwater conceded that the incident was not part of the fbi 
report on tower seen by bush but rejected it as more innuendo and 
rumor

police have arrested three local 
officials and several other people accused of inciting unrest by 
ethnic albanians in kosovo province authorities and news reports 
said thursday 
the arrests followed widespread protests against planned 
constitutional changes that ethnic albanians fear will limit their 
autonomy in the southern province which borders albania 
the official tanjug news agency said authorities arrested azem 
vlasi one of the most popular communist party leaders among ethnic 
albanians in the province and two directors of a mine whose 
workers strike helped set off the wave of protests the report did 
not say when they were detained 
tomislav sekulic the secretary of kosovos communist leadership 
announced thursday that police began arresting an unspecified number 
of ethnic albanians who allegedly organized the recent protests 
there 
officials in the republic of serbia of which kosovo is an 
adminstrative part have claimed that the protests were orchestrated 
by alleged albanian separatists whose ultimate aim they say is for 
the region to secede from yugoslavia in order to join neighboring 
communist albania 
serbia claims it needs closer control over kosovo in order to 
protect the slav minority there which alleges constant persecution 
and harassment by ethnic albanians who make up 90 percent of the 
regions population 
the situation in kosovo where emergency measures were introduced 
monday in an attempt to prevent possible intercommunal clashes 
between ethnic albanians and slavs appeared to have returned to 
normal on thursday 
the strikes that have plagued the region for the past two weeks 
ceased as authorities ordered about 23500 employees in essential 
services back to work 
serbias ambitious communist party boss slobodan milosevic 
vowed on tuesday at a counterdemonstration by over 500000 serbs in 
belgrade that organizers of the recent ethnic albanian protest and 
strikes in kosovo would be punished and arrested 
vlasi 41 an ethnic albanian who headed the provincial partys 
ruling politburo from 1986 to 1988 was the chief opponent of 
milosevics push for more centralized government 
for his consistent opposition to serbias policies towards kosovo 
he was voted out of the countrys 165member policysetting central 
committee he is still a member of kosovos central committee 
also detained were two directors of the trepca lead and zinc 
mine aziz abrasi and burhan kavaja the state tanjug news agency 
reported 
the mine was the scene of an eightday sitin last week by over 
1300 ethnic albanian miners who protested planned changes in the 
constitution which would bring kosovo under tighter control of 
serbia 
the miners agreed to come out of their pits only after three 
leading kosovo officials including the current provincial party 
boss rahman morina resigned 
the trio although ethnic albanians are considered supporters of 
milosevics policy of seeking tighter serbian control of the 
province 
a brief tanjug dispatch said that vlasi abrasi and kavaja had 
been arrested on the basis of data indicating that by their 
activities in november 1988 and february 1989 they have committed 
crimes punishable under yugoslav laws 
the three would be handed over to judicial organs for further 
investigation and possible trial tanjug said 
in november up to 100000 ethnic albanians demonstrated in the 
provincial capital of pristina protesting vlasis ouster from the 
kosovo politburo as demanded by serbian leaders 
the direct reason for vlasis arrest was believed to be his 
secret visit to the trepca mine protesters

the soviet union has conveyed a us request 
that ethiopia press sudanese rebels to allow free passage for 
international food convoys to avoid mass starvation a senior 
american diplomat said thursday 
kenneth brown deputy assistant secretary of state for africa 
also urged the embattled sudanese government to sign a ceasefire 
with the rebels so food supplies can get to as many as 2 million 
needy people in governmentcontrolled areas 
brown spoke to a joint session of the house select committee on 
hunger and the subcommittee on africa which adopted a resolution 
calling on the administration to enlist soviet help in resolving the 
sudan crisis 
the resolution and a similar one adopted by the senate foreign 
relations committee also urged the administration to reassess its 
aid to sudan unless the government facilitates food deliveries and 
negotiates peace with the rebels 
brown told the hearing secretary of state james baker iii is 
aware of demands by members of congress that the state department 
appoint a special envoy to mediate between the ethiopianbacked 
rebels and the usbacked government 
that may well be the way to go brown said but right now 
it would not have the effect we want 
the state department will not take any action until the 
government crisis is resolved in sudan he indicated the sudanese 
military has given prime minister sadiq mahdi an ultimatum to sign a 
proposed ceasefire agreement with the rebel sudan peoples 
liberation army 
the military did not say what it would do if mahdi failed to 
comply but mahdi threatened to resign next week unless the army 
promises not to overthrow him and leaders of trade and professional 
unions pledge not to strike 
the spla predominantly christian has been fighting for six 
years for economic and social concessions from the moslemdominated 
northern government 
critics have accused the government of a plan to starve the 
southerners to death whether in rebelheld areas or in refugee 
encampments in the central sector and around khartoum 
the state department which officially attributes the problem to 
government inefficiency has privately expressed increasing 
frustration with the governments neglect of southern refugees in

the health insurance association of america 
said thursday the private sector can meet the demands of the 
countrys longterm health care needs with a minimum of government 
involvement 
the association released two surveys it says show the insurance 
industry can meet longterm care needs at a cost that most americans 
are willing to pay 
longterm care services which cost about 50 billion annually in 
1987 are expected to grow to 120 billion in 2018 as the us 
population ages the association estimated 
in one of the surveys the association determined that the number 
of companies offering coverage for longterm care has grown sixfold 
over four years from 16 in 1984 to 105 last year 
since 1986 the number of policies sold has risen from 150000 to 
more than 11 million as of the end of 1988 the association said 
another survey conducted by the university of marylands center 
on aging found that 60 percent of those polled said 
governmentfunded longterm care programs should be restricted to 
the most needy however threequarters said they would favor the 
government helping people buy private longterm care coverage the 
survey said 
the survey polled 1003 adults living in residential households 
in the continental united states they were questioned by telephone

beijing tv bowed to popular demand and will 
continue showing the american cartoon program the transformers 
even though legislators criticized it as too violent and commercial 
a newspaper said thursday 
the peoples daily said the station decided to keep the 
transformers on the air after conducting a survey of viewers 
last month 20 members of the national peoples congress chinas 
legislature urged a ban on the cartoon saying the absurd 
ideological content of the transformers especially its promotion 
of war as something good will poison the next generation 
the lawmakers also said the program contains disguised 
advertising and called for a ban on transformer toys robots 
that can be altered into cars planes and other shapes 
toy robots modeled after characters in the cartoon are now hot 
items in stores despite prices ranging up to 270 per set 
equivalent to a chinese workers annual wage 
the cartoon is shown in translation in beijing and shanghai and 
several publishing houses have issued picture books of characters 
from the program which features good robots in battle against their 
evil counterparts 
the newspaper quoted a tv station official as saying the station 
attaches importance to the advice of the legislators but that they 
found the cartoon is popular amoung young viewers and many people 
consider it helpful for developing a childs intelligence and 
imagination 
shanghais xinmin evening news said the cartoon was full of 
wisdom enthusiasm and advice to young viewers about the 
distinction between justice and hegemony kindness and bellicosity

the supreme court was asked thursday to delay 
the partial merger of the detroit news and detroit free press to 
give opponents of the business agreement time for further appeal 
attorneys for public citizen a washington advocacy group founded 
by ralph nader said in their motion a delay is justified because 
they have a strong chance of success in their petition asking 
the supreme court to consider the case which would be filed within 
30 days 
the motion was filed with chief justice william rehnquist on 
behalf of michigan citizens for an independent press a coalition of 
newspaper readers and advertisers who have been battling the 
proposed agreement 
bill schultz an attorney for public citizen said the court 
likely would decide in june whether to hear the case if the court 
accepts the appeal a final decision on the newspapers joint 
operating agreement could come as late as next spring schultz said 
the us circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia 
last week rejected opponents request for a rehearing the court 
ruled the newspapers joint operating agreement could go into effect 
late monday or afterward 
under the proposed agreement an exemption to antitrust laws 
under the newspaper preservation act the news and the free press 
would combine their business and production departments while 
maintaining separate news and editorial operations 
the profits from the combined newspapers would be split 5050 for 
most of the 100year life of the agreement 
attorneys for the newspapers said they would file an early 
response to the motion 
the owner of the news gannett co inc of arlington va 
declined comment on the opponents motion a spokesman for the free 
press owner knightridder inc of miami was unavailable for 
comment 
in their motion the opponents argued the case was important 
because the precedent it sets will determine the fate of 
newspapers in the 25 american cities that have competing daily 
newspapers 
they also argued the case would have an impact on the extent to 
which a court can review administrative actions by federal agencies 
the newspapers proposed the agreement in 1986 shortly after 
gannett purchased the news 
thenattorney general edwin meese iii approved the antitrust 
exemption last year and it has since survived a federal district 
court challenge and an appeal 
knightridder has said lack of a joint operating agreement would 
force it to close the free press

it cost at least 6 million and took 
almost 10 years to convict and execute ted bundy but attorney 
general bob butterworth says it was worth the time and money 
i personally believe ted bundy was the type of person that if 
he had escaped or could have been let loose at some point in time 
would have killed again butterworth said wednesday 
bundy was executed jan 24 for murdering a 12yearold lake city 
girl ending nearly a decade of appeals of that conviction and a 
second convicition and death sentence for murdering two florida 
state university students 
ted bundy in his last days admitted killing about 36 
butterworth said i dont believe society had any other choice but 
to make sure that he was convicted that he was incarcerated and 
that he was executed 
death penalty opponents say it would have been cheaper to lock 
him up for life although butterworth disagrees no one has precise 
costs 
state prison officials say it now costs almost 36 a day or 
about 13000 a year to hold each inmate but costs for inmates 
requiring extra security or other extras would be higher on death 
row with the statepaid legal help that is usually provided the 
costs are yet higher 
id personally be surprised if its less than 100000 a year 
for a person on death row butterworth said 
some officials estimate overall costs including investigations 
in other states at up to 10 million in the bundy case butterworth 
spokesman tom hillstrom said estimates in the range of 6 million to 
7 million are credible figures for total costs including prison 
housing legal aid investigation and prosecution 
a washington law firm donated almost 1 million worth of lawyers 
time and 100000 in expenses representing bundy on appeal 
in terms of time and dollars the bundy case would have 
absolutely overwhelmed us said larry spalding director of the 
state office that usually handles such appeals

she underwent a lifesaving but painful bone marrow transplant at 
city of hope in early 1987 doctors told her she had no chance of 
living without the transplant and a 20 percent to 30 percent chance 
of survival with it 
las vegans contributed more than 150000 to help defray costs 
and her brother was the donor 
wednesdays surgery was needed because eight years of radiation 
and other therapy had blocked the blood flow into certain areas of 
the femur or thigh bone in both legs effectively killing the head 
of the bone doctors drilled holes in the bones in an effort to 
restore blood flow 
pida said his daughter refused general anesthesia or spinal tap 
to block the pain opting for local anesthetic 
she has bad feelings about being put to sleep pida said 
she said it was the worst pain shes ever felt 
but shes been through so much pain in her life she probably 
doesnt realize how much she went through she said later she must 
have broken the nurses hand she was holding 
pida said doctors told valerie that if she continues to have pain 
in a month they will know the surgery failed the next step would 
be to replace the bone with plastic parts 
the second anniversary of the marrow transplant considered a 
significant date in the success of the procedure is a few weeks 
away

the jefferson airplane whose soaring vocals 
and political lyrics helped define the psychedelic rock of san 
franciscos flower power era will fly again 
grace slick paul kantner jorma kaukonen and jack casady are 
planning to reunite for the first time in 17 years and are 
reportedly close to signing a recording contract 
marty balin who left the group after the volunteers album in 
1969 hasnt come aboard yet but kantner is still hoping the singer 
will become part of the bornagain airplane 
i think we had all thought about reorganizing the airplane in 
the last few years kantner said after the reunion was announced 
wednesday he said the idea really came together after his own 
group played at the new fillmore auditorium in march 1988 
grace came out to sing at that show and we all felt very good 
jorma and jack seemed to like the idea of us all working together 
again and wed all written new songs and wanted to perform them 
kantner said 
slick whose powerful vocals made white rabbit and somebody 
to love rocknroll classics also sang with kantner earlier in 
1988 at san franciscos great american music hall 
the two once lived together and have a daughter china 
the airplanes albums included surrealistic pillow after 
bathing at baxters crown of creation bless its pointed 
little head volunteers bark and long john silver 
casady and kaukonen formed hot tuna an acoustic blues band 
in the early 1970s and eventually left the airplane slick and 
kantner worked on several projects together and formed the jefferson 
starship in 1974 
kantner left the jefferson starship in 1984 and his departure 
led to a legal battle with slick over money and use of the bands 
name a settlement in 1987 gave the group the right to use the name 
starship kantner got 250000 slick set out on a solo career early 
last year 
grace seems reborn after leaving the starship group shes 
become involved in the world wildlife fund organization and one of 
her new songs is dedicated to pandas kantner said 
the four of us myself grace jorma and jack are planning 
to record with ron nevison producing later this spring he 
said nevison was on our road production crew years ago and now 
hes a big record producer 
we havent signed a contract yet and yes rca our original 
label is interested 
with the record finished and on the market by midsummer we 
hope to go on tour and we hope along the way that marty will 
rejoin us kantner said marty has been involved in his own 
thing for quite a while and we dont know now how he feels about 
joining the bornagain airplane hes very much his own man you 
know 
kantner said each group member will probably have three songs on 
the new album mine will be poeticalpolitical statements like 
falling in love with nicaragua 
slick said the reunion was loose it wasnt planned she said 
the reaction to last years fillmore show was more striking than 
we planned so we thought wed make a record

fossil bones of a planteating dinosaur found in 
the antarctic prove there was a mild climate there 70 million years 
ago a british scientist said thursday 
we discovered jawbones much of the vertebral column and the 
fore limbs which identify the animal as a birdhipped dinosaur 
similar to hypsilophodon which has been found in australia north 
amerca europe and possibly north africa said michael thomson a 
scientist who led an expedition to the area 
there could not have been much ice or snow in the region in 
those days because the dinosaur was a land animal and it wouldnt 
have liked frosty nights 
he said the dinosaur was about 10 feet long and walked on its 
hind legs 
thomson 46 spoke in a telephone interview from cambridge where 
he is head of geology at the british antarctic survey 
he said the expedition also found shells especially ammonites 
fossilized leaves from conifers and broadleaved trees as well as 
tree trunks and ferns proving there was a food source for the 
dinosaur 
thomson said the fossils were found during a sixweek geological 
research cruise this year around the north and east of james ross 
island in british antarctic territory 700 miles from the tip of 
south america 
he said the dinosaur bones were picked up and given to him by 
peter bengtson a swedish paleontologist who joined scientists from 
britain brazil australia and new zealand for the voyage on the 
survey ship john biscoe 
three years ago we found some bones of a marine reptile the 
plesiosaur and as argentine geologists had found fragments of an 
armored dinosaur in antarctica i knew it was a likely place for 
other finds thomson said 
the bones were in shallowwater marine rocks and thomson said the 
beast probably died on land and floated out to sea before becoming 
buried and fossilized 
there were active volcanoes nearby in those times and the area 
would have been something like indonesia is today he added 
thomson described the area as several square miles of bare rock 
with only mosses and lichens and not many of those growing 
there now 
the continents in the southern hemisphere were once a single land 
mass that has been named gondwanaland about 150 million years ago 
it began to split apart eventually to form south america africa 
australia and antarctica 
the newly found dinosaur would have been one of the last of its 
kind because the animals were starting to die out about that time 
when antarctica was still close to south america and australia was 
only starting to break away thomson said 
the bones are now under study at the natural history museum in 
london where they may eventually be put on display

chilean navy frogmen plunged into icy 
antarctic waters on thursday and sealed the tanks of a grounded 
peruvian scientific ship to stop an oil leak that caused a 
halfmilelong slick the navy reported 
the leak ceased entirely by midafternoon and chilean sailors set 
out floating booms around the vessel the humdoldt to stop further 
spread of the oil the navy said in a communique issued in punta 
arenas 1550 miles south of santiago 
a navy spokesman in punta arenas lt cristian carbone told the 
associated press by telephone that our priority task at this point 
is to contain the spill floating the humboldt comes next 
he said the crews are operating out of the cutter yelcho which 
arrived at the site at dawn thursday and that the frogmen are 
working with colleagues from nearby uruguayan and south korean 
antarctic stations 
the frogmen confirmed after completing their inspection that the 
humboldt sustained no serious damage and refloating the vessel 
should not be difficult carbone said 
the humboldt run aground shortly before midnight sunday at the 
entrance of marion cove on king george island all 64 scientists 
and sailors aboard were rescued unharmed by the british navys ice 
patrol ship endurance on wednesday some of the sailors returned to 
the ship to help with the operations 
carbone said the barrier set up around the humboldt is the same 
type used a month ago to contain an oil spill caused by the bahia 
paraiso paradise bay an argentine navy vessel that run aground 
off the antarctic peninsula

a house subcommittee chairman said thursday he 
wont try to block the pentagons request for a trident nuclear 
submarine this year but warned the navy must slow its oneayear 
purchase rate of the missilefiring sub if it wants to create a 
600ship navy 
im in no way running down the trident rep charles e 
bennett dfla told navy officials im just trying to get the 
navy to reach its 600ship goal were very short in other 
ships 
an 18500ton trident at 13 billion is much more expensive 
than most navy ships delaying a trident for a year could free money 
for several surface ships 
bennett chairman of the house armed services seapower 
subcommittee last year successfully had the trident scratched from 
the budget and added two aegis destroyers with the extra money but 
trident money was eventually restored 
last month bennett said he would look at eliminating money for 
the nations 17th trident from the fiscal 1990 budget but he said 
thursday that the timing of an elimination was wrong and he said he 
will support the program the pledge virtually eliminated any threat 
to the trident this year 
vice adm daniel cooper assistant chief of naval operations for 
undersea warfare told the subcommittee a oneyear delay in the 
trident would result in 150 million to 170 million in added costs 
in fiscal 1991 
cooper attributed the projected increase to the added cost of 
breaking the learning curve and halting the governments 
contractual agreements with the electric boat division of general 
dynamics corp electric boat is the sole builder of tridents 
bennett said the navy should avoid longterm contract options so 
the government can skip a trident purchase without suffering 
financially 
rep john g rowland rconn estimated that striking the sub 
funding would result in the loss of 3000 jobs at electric boats 
plants in groton conn and north kingstown ri 
cooper assured lawmakers that despite technological gains by the 
soviets the us submarine force remains the best in the 
world today 
the navy official defended the pentagons newest submarine the 
ssn21 seawolf attack submarine against critics who say it may not 
be able to compete against advanced soviet subs 
the navy ordered the first seawolf from electric boat in january 
cooper said navy officials scrapped plans to order two more 
ssn688 los angeles class attack submarines in 1991 and a final 
ssn688 in 1992 in part to show their commitment to the seawolf the 
navys plan now calls for the final two ssn688 subs to be purchased 
in the fiscal 1990 budget now under consideration by congress 
the seawolf will be faster quieter have the ability to dive 
deeper and have more fire power than the los angeles class sub plus 
it will be big enough for future improvements cooper said the los 
angeles class sub is so packed now that any added improvements would 
entail removal of systems already in the sub he said

a witness in oliver norths criminal trial 
testified thursday he heard north suggest at a meeting of nicaraguan 
rebels that they open a new military front and block a government 
supply route by sinking a barge in a river 
basically said rafael quintero north ran the meeting 
north who was an aide to thenpresident reagans national 
security council is on trial on 12 criminal charges one accusation 
is that he drafted letters to congress saying he had no involvement 
in the contra effort to overthrow the leftist nicaraguan government 
at a time when us law prohibited official aid to the rebels 
the meeting in a miami airport hotel room was in june 1985 
quintero testified north is accused of lying to congress in 1985 
and 1986 by denying involvement 
the defense in its questions brought out testimony from 
quintero about many contacts he said he had with cia people 
stationed in central america and with military officials in 
countries in the area questioning intended to convey to the jury 
that there was widespread involvement by the us government in the 
contra supply effort 
for example quintero said whenever he entered el salvador he had 
to clear with the us military commander there every step of the 
operation and basically everything that was to be done in 
salvador had to be done through him 
the sixth witness in the trial following quintero was richard 
b gadd a retired air force lieutenant colonel who said he arranged 
for aircraft to carry military goods covertly to the contras at the 
request of a north colleague retired maj gen richard secord 
he was still being questioned by prosecutor michael bromwich when 
us district judge gerhard a gesell dismissed the jury until 
monday friday will be devoted to legal arguments on whether new 
rules are required for handling classified documents 
also on friday us district judge aubrey robinson will sentence 
norths onetime boss former national security adviser robert 
mcfarlane who pleaded guilty to four misdemeanors involving 
withholding information from congress mcfarlane who is scheduled 
as a witness at the north trial asked to be sentenced before he 
testified 
quintero said participants at the meeting in miami discussed 
opening a southern front as a way of getting the sandinistas to draw 
away some of the 60000 sandinista troops from the honduran border 
in the north and the possibility was raised of obstructing the rama 
river where the witness said 80 percent of the sandinistas 
supplies crossed 
he used a map and pointer while he spoke and north who had never 
before moved from the defense table during testimony crossed the 
room so that he could follow the demonstration 
who suggested obstructing the river asked prosecution lawyer 
michael bromwich 
mr north did said quintero 
also attending the meeting he said were contra leaders adolfo 
calero and enrique bermudez as well as secord and an associate 
thomas clines an excia official both secord and his associate 
were involved in obtaining arms and shipping them to the contras 
quintero testifying under immunity from prosecution said he got 
involved in the covert contra activities through a call from secord 
he described himself as a combination soldier and logistics 
expert who fought in the revolution that overthrew fulgencio 
batista in cuba he said he became disenchanted when fidel castro 
allied himself with the soviet union quintero said he came to the 
united states was trained by the cia and was back in cuba to work 
with the resistance in the 1961 bay of pigs invasion that failed 
his mission in the north operation he said was to help the 
contras stay alive for the priod of time until congress resumed aid 
to the nicaraguan contras he was hired at 4000 a month plus a 
bonus for each shipment of arms he got to the contras he made 16 
trips to central america from january to june 1986 to oversee 
construction of an airstrip to be used for the southern military 
front 
quintero also testified he once heard north say that president 
reagan backed clandestine efforts to resupply the contras 
this was quintero said at a 1986 meeting in el salvador when a 
high salvadoran official declared he was not going to stick his 
neck out and have it cut off 
mr north pointed out the president was very much aware of the 
efforts this high salvadoran official was doing that the president 
wanted these efforts to continue he added 
speaking in heavily accented english quintero also told of 
another time early 1986 in el salvador when north helped settle 
a dispute between contra factions over which should receive air 
drops of supplies 
north decreed that col james steele former commander of us 
forces in el salvador and joe fernandez cia station chief in costa 
rica should have the final word quintero said 
the testimony was elicited from quintero by the prosecution in an 
effort to show north exercised much control in the contra fight from 
his post in the white house complex north has said everything he 
did was with approval from superiors

a nuclearpowered merchant ship bound for the 
eastern soviet union is spreading alarm and opposition in the region 
where it is heading a newspaper said thursday 
the 850footlong ship sevmorput is on its way to the port of 
vladivostok the government daily izvestia said it said people 
there do not conceal their alarm linked first of all to the 
ships type of propulsion 
government authorities in another port city in the eastern soviet 
union nakhodka supported residents calls to close the harbor to 
the vessel which cost 260 million to build and has no parallel 
in the world izvestia said 
it said port authorities in nakhodka had not yet been told what 
plans exist to counter possible accidents aboard the vessel 
izvestia quoted the government official in the magadan region of 
the far eastern soviet union located to the north of vladivostok 
and nakhodka as opposing the decision of the ministry of merchant 
marine to dispatch the newly built ship to the area 
it seems to me the ministry has allowed a mistake by deciding 
to send the sevmorput without asking the advice of the territory 
g dorofeyev was quoted as saying local coastal zones he said 
are practically not ready to receive it 
anything can happen dorofeyev said in our land the 
extreme north natural cataclysms are not rare 
the soviet union has other atomicpowered merchant ships 
including a fleet of icebreakers based in the port of murmansk 1000 
miles north of moscow 
the icebreakers have functioned safely for decades authorities 
say but in murmansk some residents now are calling for the vessels 
to be moved to a port further away from the city of 440000 people 
opposition to nuclear power has swelled in the soviet union since 
the april 1986 accident at the chernobyl nuclear power plant in the 
ukraine in armenia for example the government has begun shutting 
down the republics nuclear power plant because of the danger it 
might be damaged in an earthquake 
izvestia quoted a soviet nuclear power official a zhuravkov as 
saying the power plant aboard the sevmorput was of a different 
design and less liable to operator error than the reactor that was 
ruptured by a fire and explosion at chernobyl 
sevmorput is a russianlanguage phrase standing for 
northern sea route the sea lane followed by some soviet ships 
along the northern siberia coast between europe and asia izvestia 
did not give details of the giant ships envisioned role but said 
it was a lighter carrier meaning it was designed to transport 
smaller vessels

images from my 1986 visit to avons laboratories still haunt

that no company in the beauty industry has done more to reduce 
animal testing than avon he added that avon hopes to eliminate 
all animal testing within three months 
a company statement said ms rich was told by preston last week 
of the progress the company has made the company can only assume 
that peta called this boycott in a selfserving attempt to take

classroom sex education alone appears to have 
little or no effect on altering sexual activity promoting the use 
of birth control or lowering teenage pregnancy according to a 
review of five studies 
theres nothing unique about sex education as opposed to other 
information transmitted in school said dr james w stout a 
resident at childrens hospital and medical center in seattle and a 
coauthor of the review 
a person can have the information regarding their health but 
it doesnt automatically translate into their behavior he said in 
a telephone interview thursday 
a good example would be the ill health effects of cigarette 
smoking which its probably safe to say most smokers are aware of 
and yet they still smoke 
five studies from 1980 to 1987 examined the effect of classroom 
sexeducation programs at the junior and seniorhigh school level 
on teenagers from a variety of geographical areas and racial and 
socioeconomic groups the researchers said 
the sexed programs had no measurable impact on pregnancy rates 
negligible effect on the use of birthcontrol methods and 
insignificant influence on teenagers decisions about when to 
engage in their first sexual intercourse the researchers reported 
in the march issue of the journal pediatrics 
existing data suggest that a classroom course alone cannot be 
expected to change sexual behavior in a direction that is in 
opposition to the adolescents sexual world as it is molded by the 
television motion picture music and advertising industries as 
well as peer group and adult role models the researchers said 
to place the burden of counteracting the prevailing forces in 
our society toward premarital sex on our schools alone is both naive 
and inappropriate they said 
nancy watzman a spokeswoman for the center for population 
options a nonprofit organization that works to reduce teen 
pregnancy agreed with the reviews conclusion 
we believe in a very integrated approach she said thursday 
in a telephone interview from washington 
the center developed a school curriculum designed to help teens 
learn the consequences of sexual behavior but it also works to 
support schoolbased clinics that provide sexual counseling and 
contraceptives and to get the cooperation of the entertainment 
industry in supporting positive images of sexuality she said 
stout and his coauthor dr frederick p rivara of harborview 
medical center in seattle pointed to 1987 findings from a 
comprehensive communitywide sexeducation program that was much 
more successful than classroom education alone

largescale longterm detention of central 
americans seeking asylum in the united states will not solve the 
refugee problem in texas the chairman of the house immigration 
panel said thursday 
rep bruce a morrison dconn said he will search for 
solutions to problems posed by a flow of central american refugees 
into texas at brownsville he plans to spend two days in the rio 
grande valley next week 
morrison chairman of the house judiciary committees 
subcommittee on immigration refugees and international law said he 
has no preconceived notions on the eve of his trip 
however he said he is concerned about whether it is humane to 
detain central american refugees pending adjudication of their 
petitions for political asylum he also wants to determine how many 
will be held and how long and whether word that refugeeseekers are 
being detained is prompting many to go underground 
the number of refugees slowed last week after the immigration and 
naturalization service announced refugeeseekers would be detained 
while their applications are processed 
largescale detention for any significant period of time is 
never going to be a very good answer for people whose only crime is 
to cross the border illegally in search of sanctuary from either 
political persecution or economic deprivation morrison said in an 
interview 
these people are doing what has been done for a long time in 
this country people coming looking for opportunity we cannot be a 
refuge for every person in central america who would like a better 
life but putting those people in detention for significant 
periods of time is not going to solve the problem either 
morrison said he also wants to assess the impact refugees have 
had on local communities and what can be done about illegal 
trafficking in aliens the smuggling of asylumseekers along the 
route from central america

sudans major political parties met on 
thursday in an effort to end a political and economic crisis that 
threatens to topple the nearly 3yearold regime of prime minister 
sadek mahdi 
mahdi has given the the military one week to endorse his 
government or face the consequences of his resignation he has 
announced a news conference for sunday when the week ends 
foreign minister hassan turabi told the sudan news agency that 
talks were going on between his moslem fundamentalist national 
islamic front mahdis centrist umma party and the democratic 
unionist party on the formation of a new government 
but he said the positions of the rival parties remained far apart 
the democratic unionists quit the threeparty coalition 
government in december to protest mahdis economic policies and his 
refusal to approve a tentative peace treaty signed by the democratic 
unionists and the rebel sudan peoples liberation army 
mahdi formed a new government with the national islamic front 
but last month defense minister abdelmagid khalil resigned and the 
army presented mahdi with a oneweek ultimatum to form a new 
broadbased government and take active steps to resolve the 
6yearold rebellion in the south 
the armys ultimatum passed with no action but the armed forces 
remain on full alert and military leaders have insisted their 
demands be carried out 
mahdi countered the armys demands with a threat to resign unless 
the military gives him a mandate to continue leading the government 
both the armed forces and the democratic unionists want a 
government that will include all political parties as well as 
powerful trade and professional unions the democratic unionist 
party already has urged mahdi to step down 
but turabi on thursday reiterated that his party rejected such a 
government and would accept only the democratic unionists in a 
coalition 
turabi predicted that the political crisis will continue as long 
as the armed forces refuse to heed mahdis requests 
mahdi was elected prime minister following general elections 
april 25 1986 exactly a year after the military overthrew 
president gaafar nimeiri and then handed over the rule to civilians 
he took over a government saddled with a 13 billion foreign debt 
and a civil war that cost 1 million a day his inability to take 
decisive steps either in the economic or military fields has 
prompted criticism both internally and externally 
in washington thursday a senior diplomat said the soviet union 
had conveyed a us request that ethiopia press sudanese rebels to 
allow free passage for international food convoys to avoid mass 
starvation 
deputy assistant secretary of state for africa kenneth brown also 
urged the sudanese government to sign a ceasefire with the rebels 
so food supplies could get to as many as 2 million needy people in 
governmentcontrolled areas 
brown spoke to a joint session of the house select committee on 
hunger and the subcommittee on africa which adopted a resolution 
calling on the administration to enlist soviet help in resolving the 
sudan crisis 
the united states has given sudan the largest country in africa 
about 17 billion over the past 10 years but aid levels have 
dropped sharply since the 1985 peak of 350 million after the ouster 
of gaafar nimeiri a strong prowestern leader who was a personal 
friend of president bush

european economic community 
the confederation said industry and government offered a 25 
percent wage increase this year and that the wage increase in 1988 
was to 14 percent

the bush administration is weighing trade and 
economic incentives to encourage democratic reforms in nicaragua as 
the current contra aid package nears expiration administration and 
congressional sources said thursday 
secretary of state james a baker iii who huddled with members 
of congress on options for approval of new contra aid was said to 
be open to a combination of new incentives and traditional economic 
sanctions 
the united states currently has a trade embargo with nicaragua 
baker in a series of capitol hill meetings circulated a 10page 
document marked secret it contained general objectives for the 
administrations central american policy and outlined political 
objectives for a bipartisan policy according to participants who 
saw it 
the administration is deciding how much aid to propose for the 
usbacked rebels when the current 27 million humanitarian aid 
package runs out at the end of this month and how long to maintain 
funding in light of the recent central american presidents peace 
agreement 
that feb 14 pact calls for disbanding the contra forces as 
nicaragua arranges to repatriate them and makes internal democratic 
reforms such as speeding up elections and freeing political 
prisoners 
president bush met thursday with guatemalan president vinicio 
cerezo and reiterated us doubts about nicaraguas commitment said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
officially the administration has not decided whether to seek a 
new contra aid package fitzwater said 
but privately officials say the state departments efforts are 
geared toward putting together a new aid package that will be 
acceptable to the democraticcontrolled congress 
among us actions sources said baker was considering are trade 
and economic incentives to help nicaraguas failing economy if 
nicaragua lives up to its democratization pledges 
baker is also considering a range of possible us actions that 
could include such things as resumption of normalized relations on 
visas trade foreign aid and exchange of diplomats said one 
administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
fitzwater said that the presidents contra policy is still in the 
formative stages 
were reviewing the matter now with a view toward the 
humanitarian aid fitzwater said 
congressional and administration sources have said there has been 
no substantive talk of renewing military aid at this point to the 
11000member contra force the current humanitarian aid package 
runs out before the 90day deadline for the central american plan to 
be completed 
we are looking at all aspects of this situation said 
fitzwater adding we would like a diplomatic solution in terms of 
some kind of proposal or agreement that all the countries in the 
region can find acceptable and reasonable and so well be looking 
at a lot of different angles 
bakers discussions on capitol hill were seen in part as an 
effort to get moving on central america amid accusations that bush 
is not moving in foreign affairs 
in the case of central america the lack of clear direction has 
sparked complaints by those interested in the region from lobbyists 
to congress to latin americans themselves such people have grumbled 
about the time bush and baker have taken to name middle level 
officials to coordinate the policy 
it has also intensified the spotlight on the peace talks among 
the presidents of costa rica guatemala el salvador nicaragua and 
honduras 
the bush administration wants its concerns addressed in the final 
plan to disband the contras 
part of whats driving them the central american presidents 
is our own policy vacuum said an administration source who spoke 
on condition of anonymity they had no idea what our policy was 
when they met 
bakers discussions with congress were to get us out of this 
vacuum the source said 
key to the administration approach is building a bipartisan basis 
for a policy based on giving diplomacy a chance said state 
department spokesman charles redman 
we are now at a stage where we are engaging in talks in even 
greater detail on that particular policy the focus of the policy 
will be democratization redman said 
bush and baker continue to stress the need for mechanisms to 
ensure that the sandinistas follow through on their promises and 
for timetables tying the realization of their reforms to the 
disarmament of the contras 
cerezo told reporters that the central americans have discussed 
humanitarian aid to keep the contra force alive while nicaragua 
arranges to repatriate them

an iranian diplomat met thursday with un 
officials to begin preparing for a joint meeting of iran and iraqs 
foreign ministers aimed at breaking the deadlock in their peace 
talks 
iraqs foreign minister tariq aziz and his iranian counterpart 
ali akbar velayati agreed feb 10 to meet for unmediated talks 
in late march or early april at an undisclosed site in new york 
irans deputy foreign minister mohammed hussain lavasani opened 
two days of meetings thursday with the secretarygenerals special 
representative to the talks swedish ambassador jan k eliasson and 
other un officials 
next week iraqi representatives will meet with eliasson and the 
un experts to present their views 
aziz meanwhile accused iran of perverse behavior for 
refusing to allow its military officers to meet with their iraqi 
counterparts in an effort to reduce tensions on the 740mile front 
line of the conflict where a tenuous ceasefire has been in force 
since aug 20 
in late january iran and iraq agreed to a variety of 
confidencebuilding measures including establishing a joint 
military committee to discuss allegations of truce violations 
despite their failure to compromise on the fundamental issues of the 
war 
in a letter sent to secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
this week aziz said iran and iraq had agreed to hold the first 
meeting of the iraniraq mixed military working group on feb 22 
the iranian side however broke that agreement and refused to 
hold the meeting as agreed aziz said in his letter 
iran has not offered any official response 
in baghdad a senior un official said thursday that the meeting 
between iraqi and iranian officers can take place as soon as the 
problem over its location is solved 
salim fahmawi chief spokesman for the 350strong un observer 
group monitoring the gulf war ceasefire said that both sides are 
willing to hold the meeting soon 
both iran and iraq have issued bellicose pronouncements prior to 
each round of their peace talks which began in geneva last aug 25 
but immediately deadlocked on the key issues 
iran insists that the next step must be the withdrawal of troops 
to the border iraq still holds about 260 square miles of iranian 
territory 
iraq however maintains that iran must relinquish its right to 
search ships in international waters of the gulf for iraqbound war 
cargo iran has not actually stopped any ships since the beginning 
of the ceasefire but reserves its right to do so 
baghdad also wants the shatt alarab waterway its only outlet to 
the gulf cleared of sunken ships and silt iran refuses to 
cooperate with any plans to open the waterway unless baghdad 
recognizes a 1975 treaty that sets the border in the middle giving 
each nation control of one bank

the citys better air campaign couldnt induce 
motorists to drive any less but it cut carbon monoxide emissions 
through its mandatory woodburning and oxygenated fuels programs 
denvers mayor said thursday 
spurred by the success clean air drive organizers announced 
plans to expand the program next winter to include fort collins 
greeley and colorado springs until now the fiveyearold better 
air campaign has affected only metropolitan denver and boulder 
denver mayor federico pena reported the findings at a news 
conference at which final department of health figures for this year 
were released 
colorado began the program because of health concerns and because 
officials worried that the regions infamous brown cloud was 
making it less attractive to new business 
the better air campaign had no effect on driving this year but 
its mandatory oxygenated fuels program introduced last year 
reduced carbon monoxide emissions by 12 percent and its woodburning 
program cut emissions by 68 percent figures showed 
voluntary driving restrictions on high pollution days are in 
effect from november to january and the oxygenated fuels 
requirement from october to january the better air campaign is held 
during the winter when temperature inversions typically cause air 
quality to decline 
without the better air campaign public acceptance of the 
woodburning and oxygenatedfuels programs would have been more 
difficult to achieve pena said 
the federal carbon monoxide standard was violated only nine days 
during the past year in downtown denver the figures showed 
compared with 110 days in 1971 when the health department began 
keeping records of violations 
pena said the figures for the drivereduction part of the program 
were revised after an error was discovered in january in the 1983 
base year data officials found the number of miles reported driven 
in 1983 was 10 percent too high partly as a result better air 
campaign figures until this year often showed reductions in miles 
driven ranging up to 10 percent 
the 198889 mileage figures which showed no decrease from the 
base year were compiled after a monthlong reevaluation of the 
base year figure the mayor said 
brad beckham director of the colorado air pollution control 
division said that besides expanding the better air campaign to 
other front range cities the program will be revised to target all 
types of air pollution on a yearround basis the new program will 
also narrow its focus to target only schools government and 
businesses instead of being a broadbased effort he said 
he said the program would include having employers provide ways 
for employees to ride the bus more often introduce incentives for 
carpooling and modify existing vehicles to pollute less 
dr tom vernon executive director of the colorado department of 
health said traffic is projected to double by the year 2010 and 
even though a reduction cannot be attributed to driving 
drivingreduction measures must still be included in future 
campaigns 
the better air campaign was begun after studies showed vehicles 
account for 75 percent of the denver areas carbonmonoxide 
pollution while woodburning stoves and fireplaces were blamed for 
15 percent

cbs declared thursday that it has shaken off the 
worst effects of last summers strike by the writers guild of 
america but abc says it is suffering something of a delayed 
reaction 
nbc thanks to the summer olympics and the world series was not 
seriously affected by the 4month strike last summer and remains 
ahead of the competition in the 198889 primetime television season 
by the end of the february sweep one of four months a year when 
local tv ratings are measured for purposes of determining 
advertising rates nbc led with an average ac nielsen co rating 
of 163 cbs had a 147 and abc a 124 the rating is a percentage 
of 904 million us homes with televisions 
the writers strike ended in august and the sporting events 
allowed nbc to delay production of new series episodes the other two 
networks had counted on 
cbs started the season late in a weak position having finished 
third the previous season abc started late too but was soon flush 
with the top10 success of its new roseanne 
abc then suffered a 28 percent decline in february compared to 
february 1988 when it had the winter olympics nbc and cbs showed 
increases this february over last 
the fournight hit miniseries lonesome dove boosted cbs above 
abc in the february sweep and helped put it in a virtual tie with 
its rival for second place this season 
this is the first time in about six of these sweeps where we 
can say were closer to the firstplace network than the thirdplace 
network said cbs vice president for marketing david poltrack 
we were the most negatively impacted by the strike we got off 
last poltrack said we made some changes made some adjustments 
and we think weve turned things around and are going in the right 
direction 
abc got through the november sweep with help from the first 18 
hours of the 32hour miniseries war and remembrance it was 
hardly a ratings blockbuster but it did better than abcs regular 
programming would have the decision to program war and 
remembrance as a november fillin came back to haunt the network 
in february when war and remembrance was to have run 
clearly we had a disappointing sweeps said alan wurtzel 
abcs senior vice president for marketing and research 
we did not have an enormous inventory because we had to play 
war and remembrance early and we had planned to play it in 
february he said the other two networks knew that and planned 
accordingly 
lonesome dove and the competition it attracted kept the 
networks aggregate rating in february from looking like yet another 
example of audience erosion this sweep was about four rating points 
lower than last years but last february there were 16 nights of 
winter olympics 
cbs got a big push both in ratings and morale from lonesome 
dove the highestrated network miniseries in more than four 
years but the western miniseries success pleased abc and nbc too 
i think lonesome dove was beneficial to everybody wurtzel 
said network television needs to have exciting wellmade 
programming 
abc and cbs are looking ahead to a spring when they and their 
viewers can expect to reap one benefit from the effects of last 
summers strike fewer reruns 
then the networks can begin to worry anew the screen actors 
guild contract is up at the end of june and there is talk of a 
possible strike

west germany carried its dispute with the united 
states over shortrange nuclear arms to an international forum on 
thursday urging that eastwest negotiations on reducing them begin 
immediately 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher of west germany told the 
40nation conference on disarmament we consider negotiations on 
shortrange nuclear systems as agreed in the western alliance at 
reykjavik in 1987 to be a top priority 
they should begin without delay he said and there are no 
reasonable grounds for not initiating such negotiations 
the united states wants to modernize the existing nato stockpile 
of shortrange nuclear arms and has opposed early negotiations 
which several other european allies join the west germans in 
supporting 
genscher cited the soviet unions great superiority in 
shortrange systems which have a maximum range of 300 miles and 
said the kremlin should offer to make unilateral cuts 
we are open as far as the framework and the participants are 
concerned he told a news conference later our goal is simply 
to open negotiations 
shortrange missiles are certainly not the central means of 
european security what concerns us is a political concept that 
embodies all aspects of the eastwest relationship so the west can 
respond positively to changes occurring in eastern europe he said 
he welcomed the soviet unions readiness for negotiations and 
declared to the conference what we need are not firebreaks 
against new disarmament negotiations but firebreaks to prevent an 
unbridled arms race 
secretary of state james a baker iii said after touring nato 
capitals last month the answer might be to couple modernization with 
negotiations and he expected the disagreement to be resolved before 
the alliance summit in may

investigators have cracked a major spy 
ring in which west german hackers allegedly acquired sensitive 
military computer passwords and codes and sold them to the soviets 
an official said thursday 
a west german television network said the passwords and other 
information came from key military and research computers in the 
united states western europe and japan 
three west germans have been detained on suspicion of obtaining 
information about access to databanks and to have passed that on to 
soviet intelligence agents said roland bachmeier spokesman for 
the federal interior ministry 
he refused to confirm other details of a report by the 
norddeutsche rundfunk broadcasting network 
the pentagon issued a onesentence statement thursday saying 
until possibly affected components of the department of defense 
have had a chance to analyze the report we have no reaction 
william caldwell a pentagon spokesman said the department would 
have no further comment before friday at the earliest 
one security source in west germany speaking in an interview 
with the associated press on condition of anonymity said the 
hackers tried to break into a large us military computer 
network in west germany but failed to gain access to secret material 
police in hanover arrested two computer hackers on suspicion of 
espionage activities for an eastern european intelligence agency 
said alexander prechtel spokesman for the federal prosecutors 
office in karlsruhe another suspect was arrested in west berlin he 
said 
they are suspected of breaking into foreign computer systems 
and selling information to communist agents prechtel said 
he said investigators still are trying to determine how much 
damage the suspected espionage had caused to western security 
interests 
norddeutsche rundfunk reported the hackers gained access to a key 
us defense department computer and to important research computers 
elsewhere 
they obtained sensitive information that would allow the soviets 
to gain access to the computers the network said 
among the computers was the us defense departments general 
databank known as optimus a nasa computer as well as computers 
tied to nuclear weapons and energy research in new mexico and 
illinois the network said 
those facilities are the los alamos national laboratory in los 
alamos nm and the fermi national accelerator laboratory near 
chicago 
the information also would give the kremlin access to us 
military supply depot statistics and to computers belonging to 
several european institutes that deal with atomic and aerospace 
research the network statement said 
thousands of computer codes passwords and programs were 
delivered to the soviets the network said they opened the door 
for the kgb to gain access to some of the most important computer 
centers of the western world 
norddeutsche rundfunk said three suspects had been detained 
following searches of at least six apartments in west berlin and 
hanover the network also said investigators had seized extensive 
evidence in the searches 
according to the network authorities believe three west germans 
were recruited by the soviet kgb in 1985 and were paid with cash 
and drugs and were later forced to provide the codes and 
passwords to the soviets 
the network also said the three handed over highly sensitive 
information from the united states japan great britain france 
italy switzerland and west germany at a 1985 meeting with two kgb 
agents in east berlin 
bachmeier said the arrests followed an investigation by the 
federal constitution protection office the countrys main 
counterespionage bureau as well as criminal investigators and the 
federal prosecutors office

a philadelphia man who was ordered deported 
following claims that he killed jews during world war ii has fled to 
paraguay the justice department said thursday 
george theodorovich 66 withdrew his appeal of a deportation 
order with immigration authorities after obtaining a visa to travel 
to paraguay the department said 
the retired meat cutter who went to paraguay two months ago was 
ordered deported in 1987 by an immigration judge after the justice 
department produced reports that he had written to account for 
bullets he used to shoot jews 
the justice departments office of special investigations charged 
that theodorovich a member of the ukrainian police during nazi 
occupation in the city of lvov had concealed his activities when he 
entered this country after the war 
the immigration judge had found that theodorovich did assist 
and otherwise participate in the persecution of jews in lvov during 
19421944 
he was a ukrainian policeman for two years when lvov went from 
a city of 160000 jews to a mere handful us immigration judge 
john f gossart jr said in his order 
theodorovich was ordered deported to argentina but the case was 
before the board of immigration appeals when theodorovich fled to 
paraguay on dec 18 1988 
the justice department was not notified that theodorovich had 
fled the country until this week when it received papers filed by 
his attorney with the immigration appeals board 
the evidence in this case particularly the important documents 
keeping track of the bullets expended by theodorovich in killing 
jews showed his direct role in the destruction of one of the 
largest jewish communities in europe neal sher the justice 
departments chief nazi hunter said in a statement 
theodorovich is the second former member of the ukrainian police

retirees who spend their winters at a 
trailer park here are angry over a plan to convert a nearby 
warehouse into a detention center for hundreds of central americans 
trying to enter the united states 
the justice departments community relations service is turning a 
metal building next to the snowbird court trailer park into a 
shelter because space is running out at a center 20 miles away in 
the border city of brownsville said american red cross spokeswoman 
patty garner 
the red cross under a contract with the government is caring 
for the immigrants but the residents of the snowbird court rv park 
primarily retirees from canada and the midwest do not welcome the 
prospect of the new shelter 
you save all summer to come down here and relax and have a good 
time and they pull this kind of number on you said hilda lee a 
snowbird resident from east dubuque ill were being robbed of 
our vacation 
she and other park residents said they were worried the often 
destitute central americans might bring an increase in thefts to the 
area 
you know as well as i know if people are hungry they may go 
ahead and take something thats not theirs said tom wright of 
ontario canada 
the red cross shelter in brownsville is nearing its capacity of 
800 people ms garner said 
if we reach capacity here in brownsville we will be able to 
begin housing people there in san benito also ms garner said 
officials are not sure how soon they can open the new facility 
the san benito building a 31000squarefoot structure 
resembling a large airplane hangar will be equipped to house up to 
600 people she said 
increased border patrol activity and new immigration and 
naturalization service policies have put the ins in a bind for space 
recently 
the ins on feb 21 started holding applicants seeking political 
asylum whose cases were denied in a new oneday adjudication 
procedure it also has stopped releasing those apprehended by the 
border patrol on their own recognizance 
the brownsville shelter and the new one being prepared at san 
benito are for family groups who must report for daily roll calls 
but are not locked up 
pat thompson owner of snowbird court said she fears the new 
neighbors will scare her business away 
this lower rio grande valleys crawling with mobile home 
parks ms thompson said they dont have to stay here 
others are concerned about sanitation problems that prompted the 
city of harlingen to evict the ins from a building last month 
jeffrey weiss associate director for immigration and refugee 
affairs with the justice department said the government will have 
to satisfy county health authorities before moving into the san 
benito building

israeli forces in south lebanon killed four 
guerrillas thursday before they could raid northern israel the army 
said and a soldier in the gaza strip killed a palestinian who tried 
to stab a fellow trooper 
a fifth member of the palestinian guerrilla band escaped and 
soldiers were searching for him in an area about three miles north 
of the border a military source said on condition of anonymity 
an army spokesman said the guerrillas belonged to the radical plo 
faction democratic front for the liberation of palestine and were 
caught near al jibbayn village in israels selfproclaimed 
security zone lebanese police said the encounter occurred 
outside the zone 
israel established the buffer which ranges from six to 10 miles 
deep north of the border in june 1985 after withdrawing most of its 
troops to end a threeyear invasion and occupation of lebanon the 
zone is patrolled by israeli soldiers and a surrogate lebanese 
militia 
from documents and papers it was established that the 
terrorists intended to carry out an attack in one of the 
settlements in the north of israel the army said in a statement 
democratic front statements issued in lebanon and syria claimed 
its men attacked israeli troops in retaliation for an israeli air 
raid tuesday on one of its bases in the chouf mountains southeast of 
beirut 
it pledged increased attacks on israel despite plo chief yasser 
arafats renunciation of terrorism which the statement said did not 
apply to the front 
lebanese police said the four guerrillas were killed in a battle 
with israeli soldiers and their south lebanon army militia allies 
near majdel zoun village 14 miles southeast of tyre and just north 
of the security zone 
this was the second infiltration attempt in a week israel has 
blamed on the democratic front the army reported feb 23 that 
soldiers had killed three of the organizations guerrillas in the 
security zone 
maj gen yossi peled chief of the armys northern command told 
israel radio leaflets found on the men killed thursday referred to 
carrying out a hostagetaking mission in israel 
foreign ministry officials gave reporters copies of democratic 
front identification cards they said belonged to two of the three 
guerrillas killed feb 23 and also provided a copy of an 
arabiclanguage leaflet one of the men allegedly carried 
antiisraeli statements were in the leaflet but no clues to the 
groups mission 
marwan hussein khawaz 24 was the palestinian shot and killed 
thursday in the gaza strip the army said he tried to stab a soldier 
during house searches overnight 
at least 388 palestinians have been killed in the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip since an uprising began nearly 15 months ago 
seventeen israelis also have been slain 
arab reports said six palestinians were wounded in gaza and the 
west bank during stonethrowing confrontations with soldiers 
hospital officials in gaza city said a seventh palestinian 
50yearold fatima kdaih of the jabaliya refugee camp lost her 
right eye when she was hit by a rubber bullet 
soldiers kept a curfew on nablus the west banks largest city 
for the seventh conecutive day confining nearly all its 120000 
residents to their homes the curfew was imposed last friday after a 
soldier was killed by a concrete block dropped from a thirdstory 
window 
in the west bank the army destroyed five houses and sealed 
another that belonged to members of an arab group accused of killing 
a palestinian who cooperated with israeli authorities the military 
spokesman said 
the army said two other houses were destroyed that belonged to a 
second palestinian group suspected of throwing firebombs at israeli 
military patrols and the houses of palestinian collaborators 
israels desire to end us talks with the palestine liberation 
organization which it considers a terrorist organization is likely 
to be reinforced by the latest infiltration attempt 
foreign minister moshe arens said in a television interview 
thursday that he would try to convince the united states to end its 
talks with the plo when he visits new york and washington next week 
the united states opened the dialogue in tunis where the plo has 
its headquarters after arafat publicly renounced terrorism in 
december and recognized israels right to exist 
state department spokesman charles redman said wednesday the 
united states had told the plo attacks against israeli civilian 
and military targets inside or outside israel are contrary to the 
objectives of the dialogue

egyptian author naguib mahfouz on thursday 
urged moslem countries to condemn irans call for the assassination 
of salman rushdie but proposed a boycott against publishers of 
rushdies book the satanic verses mahfouz who last year became 
the first arab to win the nobel prize for literature summed up his 
views on the controversial book in an article in the stateowned 
newspaper alahram 
mahfouz said he wrote the article because some of his remarks to 
foreign reporters had been misinterpreted he said he still has not 
read rushdies book and only recently learned of its contents from 
others 
irans leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini sparked a global 
uproar last month by offering a reward for the death of rushdie 41 
an indianborn british author on grounds his book blasphemes islam 
interviewed by the associated press on feb 18 a few days after 
khomeinis statement mahfouz said he considered the iranian cleric 
guilty of terrorism and that his action had damaged the image of 
islam 
in thursdays newspaper article the 77yearold author said i 
believe khomeini inflicted harm on islam and moslems that is not 
less if not more than what the author of the book intended 
i also have said previously that freedom of opinion should be 
sacred and that thought can be rectified only with thought he 
said islams mission is not terrorism and incitement to murder 
nevertheless he said he is proposing a threepoint plan the 
books publishers should be boycotted moslem nations should reject 
khomeinis call to violence and all nations should be called upon 
to respect religions and sacred beliefs of peoples without prejudice 
to the freedom of research based on scientific standards and subject 
to discussion 
i see now that if rushdie bolted with his imagination the 
moslems misbehaved by staging demonstrations burning the book and 
calling for murder thus turning the situation upside down and 
making the culprit a victim he said 
mahfouz said that if reported accounts of the books contents 
were true then the book is not worthy of discussion and its 
authorship like any action overstepping the bounds of law and 
ethics should be fought in the courts or through deterrent measures 
at the international level 
moslems have complained that the satanic verses blasphemes 
their religion by portraying the prophet mohammeds wives as 
prostitutes and suggesting that he wrote the koran islams holy 
book rather than receiving it from god through the angel gabriel 
rushdie contends his book is fictional and not blasphemous he 
has apologized for the distress it caused to moslems but not for its 
substance

the senate voted 940 confirmation thursday 
night of edward j derwinski as the first secretary of veterans 
affairs despite a statement by one key senator that significant 
ethical questions were raised by derwinskis 1977 tip to south 
korea that one of its agents was about to defect 
mr derwinski made significant mistakes in 1977 in making the 
disclosure and since then on a number of occasions in dissembling as 
to what he had done said sen alan cranston dcalif chairman 
of the veterans affairs committee 
i find that these actions and statements raise significant 
ethical questions cranston said at a committee session on the 
nomination a few hours before the floor vote the dissembling he 
told reporters later continued into 1989 
despite cranstons comments the panel voted 100 to recommend 
confirmation by the full senate hours later the senate went along 
in the final tally those not voting were sens david boren 
dokla david durenberger rminn al gore jr dtenn bob 
packwood rore paul simon dill and timothy wirth dcolo 
derwinski in 1977 was the senior republican on a house committee 
investigating bribery of members of congress by the korean 
government 
he told the veterans affairs committee on wednesday he 
inadvertently mentioned in a conversation with a korean diplomat on 
or near the steps of a house office building that a korean official 
was going to testify before the committee 
derwinski 62 denied being the source of the tip until 
confirmation hearings for a state department post in 1983 after 12 
terms in the house as an illinois republican the hearings and his 
admission attracted practically no public attention at the time 
cranston said he was unable to lay out the reasons for his 
conclusions because they were based on secret information in some 
cases information the white house declined to release to derwinski 
but did allow senators to inspect 
when weighed against derwinskis 30 years of service in congress 
and the state department i do not find his indiscretions as to 
this one incident to be disqualifying cranston said i am 
optimistic about mr derwinskis potential to rise above this 
unattractive episode to put it behind him once and for all 
derwinski himself did not attend the session and in a statement 
read by aide don smith ignored cranstons criticisms i appreciate 
the unanimous endorsement of the committee and will now focus my 
efforts to work for americas veterans 
senators of both parties praised cranston for thoroughness and 
fairness the senior republican frank murkowski of alaska said he 
found that derwinski had answered all questions adequately to the 
issue even though hampered by lack of access to secret information 
asked if he agreed with cranstons comments murkowski said i 
stand on my statement 
cranston scheduled a monday committee appearance on the budget by 
derwinski as expected head of the veterans administration a job he 
will hold only until march 15 when the va becomes a cabinet 
department and derwinski its secretary 
some accounts of the 1977 korean incident have said derwinski 
passed the information to the koreans in a telephone call however 
on wednesday he said the openair conversation was the only such 
discussion which he called inadvertent without giving the 
matter any serious thought and stupid 
we do not know for an absolute fact one way or another 
whether there was also a telephone call cranston said after the 
vote 
refusing to say what he was talking about cranston said there 
was a statement made by a very responsible person five years after 
events where that persons memory was faulty that led us to believe 
that perhaps something had happened that apparently did not happen 
when that was cleared up i took the position i stated 
cranston said the bush administration made available to the 
committee everything it wanted but attorney general dick thornburgh 
declined to petition the courts for the records of a grand jury that 
investigated the leak to the koreans counsel to the senate said a 
suit or petition by senators for access to those records would fail 
derwinski declined to answer questions of the grand jury the 
house ethics committee looked into the matter but declined to pursue 
it on the grounds it might jeopardize intelligence sources and 
methods 
asked if the grand jury records might have made a difference to 
the vote cranston said it depends on whats in it i really 
cant say

the worlds only election for king 
the nine state rulers went onebyone behind a screen and marked 
a yes or no on a ballot with the name of the deputy king 
sultan azlan shah 60 ruler of perak state 
sultan azlan was chosen but a breakdown of the votes was not 
given 
the present king sultan mahmood iskandar 57 will return to his 
duties as ruler of johore state when his fiveyear term ends in 
april 
royalty remained popular in malaysia after the country gained 
independence from britain in 1957 political power however is 
vested in an elected parliament both at the national and state 
levels 
the state rulers are all malays and are the heads of the islamic 
religion in their states

where 55 percent are malays 37 percent chinese and most of the rest 
indians 
the rulers on thursday also elected sultan tuanku jaafar abdul 
rahman 67 ruler of negri sembilan state as the new deputy king a 
statement from the prime ministers department said 
the new terms start april 26 
elections for king take place every five years or if a king 
dies the usual pattern in malaysia has been to elect the deputy 
king as king in at least three previous elections however the 
senior ruler has declined to run and his name was not on the ballot 
in practice the post of king has rotated among the nine states 
the king also can be removed by the nine rulers at a special 
meeting if they feel the king cannot perform his duties 
the kings monthly salary is about 23443 
sultan azlan graduated with a law degree from britains

officials said the two have reconciled 
the new deputy king is the son of malaysias first national king 
tuanku abdul rahman he also graduated in law from nottingham 
university in 1953

european aviation officials on thursday 
accused the united states of using a computerized airline 
reservation system that discriminates against european airlines 
the officials said the system favors us carriers even though 
european airlines fly the same routes to europe in less time 
consumers suffer from not always being given ready access to 
the best flight information by the us systems edward hudson 
secretary of the 22nation european civil aviation conference told 
reporters 
he said he will raise the issue this month in a meeting with us 
department of transportation officials 
there has been a marked reluctance from the us government to 
open its ears to what has been said by the europeans hudson 
complained 
he said reservations made through us computerized reservation 
systems often involve unnecessarily lengthy journey times with 
long overlays at connecting points because the computers favor 
us carriers 
he said they list us carriers on the first screen while flights 
of european carriers are tucked away on remote screens that booking 
agents do not switch to unless travelers specify what hour they want 
to leave 
it is a wellknown fact that the great majority of bookings are 
made from the first screen hudson said 
the five us systems are known as apollo sabre pars datas2 
and sysem1 hudson said none give priority to flights to europe 
where warranted 
as an example he cited a direct nonstop san franciscotoparis 
flight on frances uta airline that is up to 5 hours faster than 
flights on major us carriers which make stopovers 
yet sabre puts the uta flight on screen no 9 rather than on the 
first screen 
flights of air france british airways lufthansa alitalia and 
sas get similar treatment though they get travelers from california 
to europe hours faster than us carriers he said 
hudson said the us systems also list a service involving a 
change of aircraft or change of carrier as a direct flight or 
list connecting flights on us carriers to europe ahead of faster 
and more direct services by european carriers 
he called that misleading passengers 
international services deserve better treatment in the united 
states the conferences deputy secretary kevin kealy said 
hudson said the 22 conference nations will issue next week the 
organizations rules of conduct for west europes two main computer 
reservation systems known as amadeus and galileo these rules he 
said give noneuropean carriers firstscreen priority if their 
flights are more convenient 
he asked the us government to do likewise the rules of the 
game should be set at the government level hudson added

a man divorcing his wife has gone to 
court to keep her from becoming pregnant with fertilized eggs they 
had placed in frozen storage 
junior lewis davis 30 said in a divorce complaint last week 
that he does not want his wife mary sue davis 28 to have the 
embryos he fertilized implanted in her 
the embryos are property jointly owned by the parties davis 
said adding that mrs davis has no legal right to make any 
disposition of them without his express consent 
blount circuit judge w dale young signed an order last thursday 
temporarily keeping mrs davis from having any of her in vitro 
fertilized eggs implantedhe also barred her from removing them from 
frozen storage pending further hearings on the matter 
in the complaint davis said he and his wife both of maryville 
about 20 miles south of knoxville participated in an in vitro 
fertilization program at a knoxville hospital during the past 
several years 
he said his wifes eggs were fertilized outside the womb in a 
laboratory with his sperm and then frozen so that she could have 
them implanted inside her and possibly become pregnant at a later 
time 
despite davis divorce petition and his objection to becoming a 
father mrs davis said she eventually plans to have the eggs 
implanted according to the complaint 
davis said he had no comment on thursday mary sue davis did not 
return a telephone call made to the knoxville company where she 
works 
charles m clifford davis attorney said he would not comment 
on the case 
in vitro fertilization involves removing the womans eggs and 
fertilizing them with sperm outside the womb and then replacing them 
inside the womans body 
the practice was pioneered in great britain where in 1978 the 
worlds first socalled testtube baby was born using the method 
since then other infertile couples have used to the method 
which costs between 4000 and 10000 and has an approximately 15 
percent success rate for each implant

a 97yearold woman imploring congress for a 
boost in aid for the elderly and infirm cut short lawmakers 
questions thursday by shouting from her wheelchair im asking 
you are you going to increase my payments 
blanche brownbey of indianapolis told a house panel that she 
lives on 13 a day while everything is going up everything is 
so high it almost takes my breath 
her testimony sometimes whispered and other times feisty and 
loud came at a hearing by two congressional panels on the 
supplemental security income program a government safety net 
for the aged the blind and disabled children 
she was joined on a panel that included the director of the ssi 
program and several social workers before a joint hearing of the 
house select committee on aging and the ways and means human 
resources subcommittee ssi is operated within the social security 
administration 
rep edward roybal dcalif chairman of the aging committee 
said ssis top beneficiaries live on just 368 a month which is 
about 75 percent of the governments poverty level 
the program he said is in fact characterized by inadequate 
benefit levels large gaps in service insufficient outreach 
activities and overly rigid requirements 
he cited testimony from witnesses who said many elderly people 
were getting far less than the maximum payment and families with 
severely disabled children were being routinely rejected because of 
rigid standards 
michael carozza deputy commissioner of the social security 
administration defended the successful effective program 
ssi is an effective safety net providing the aged blind and 
disabled with a floor of income the value of which is enhanced when 
combined with medicaid food stamps and other assistance 
the poorest ssi recipients have income between 75 percent and 90 
percent of the poverty level he said 
i believe this is appropriate when you consider that ssi tends 
to be an income of last resort he added 
but mrs brownbey her frail frame sunk deep in her wheelchair 
in the middle of the cavernous committee room detailed in a 
nearwhisper how ssi benefits leave her barely able to cover her 
monthly expenses 
i pays 210 for my gas and pays 50 for my electricity she 
said holding a magnifying glass to a handwritten paper 
i have life insurance my life insurance is 35 cents a week 
and my house insurance is 286 i pay that in november 
frustrated finally by trying to read the paper she dropped her 
clipboard to the table and said im telling you my experience 
but i cant remember everything 
im telling you the truth sos you can know about me she 
continued 
she paused before quietly concluding her testimony i have my 
plot paid for in crown hill thats all 
roybal who has introduced one of three bills now in the house to 
strengthen the ssi program tried to assure her that he and others 
on the two committees want to boost the benefits but mrs brownbey 
cut him off 
are you going to increase it thats what im asking you 
if it were up to me roybal tried to assure her 
im asking you are you going to increase my payments she 
interrupted 
ssi provides benefits to about 45 million elderly blind and 
disabled adults and blind and disabled children carozzi said the 
average monthly ssi payments to recipients was about 188 as of last 
december 
one of the three bills the house is considering would raise the 
ssi benefit level to the poverty level over three years and loosen 
some eligibility standards another bill would change the way ssi 
considers elibility for disabled children and the third would 
change the way such income as unemployment compensation is 
considered under the program

banks out of 125 million by falsely claiming they were investing in 
oil and gas drilling projects pleaded guilty thursday to 98 counts 
of fraud and state securities violations 
during a halfhour hearing stephen l smith owner of the 
defunct sh oil and gas exploration switched his plea to guilty and 
polk circuit judge j tim strickland ordered a presentence 
investigation no sentencing date was set 
smith 38 remains free on 225000 bond he had no comment after 
the hearing but his attorney richard d mars said it was a 
fair disposition of the case 
state sentencing guidelines call for a sentence of 12 to 17 years 
in prison for the charges to which smith pleaded guilty two counts 
of organized fraud 48 counts of unregistered securities sales and 
48 counts of securities sales by an unregistered dealer 
each of the 98 charges carries a maximum penalty of 30 years in 
prison and a fine of 10000 
at sentencing prosecutors are expected to seek dismissal of the 
remainder of 262 state criminal charges brought last year which 
include racketeering grand theft and other securities violations 
mars said he could have faced up to 99 years in prison 
investigators claimed that smith over a nineyear period used 
money from new investors in sh oil and gas to pay dividends to 
previous investors they said smith never owned any significant 
interest in oil wells and had no legitimate business to operate 
investors included many prominent people in winter haven such as 
a former mayor top businessmen bankers attorneys and doctors as 
well as retirees 
smiths attorneys said they expect federal prosecutors to charge 
smith with grand theft and fraud in connection with about 2 million 
owed barnett bank which has offices across the state 
more than 170 investors have sued barnett bank claiming it 
failed to scrutinize smith before advising that his company was a 
sound investment no trial dates have been set 
on monday polk circuit judge dennis p maloney ruled in a civil 
case filed by the state against smith that sh oil and gas was a 
fraud the action which smiths lawyers had sought to block because 
of the criminal charges pending was intended to pave the way for 
the controller to seek a court order to distribute assets that are 
in receivership 
authorities closed down smiths 9yearold business dec 30 
1987 and asked for appointment of a receiver to manage the assets 
of the company and smith attorney william h mcbride the acting 
receiver said he has so far located about 55 million in assets 
from the defunct company 
this case will not be concluded until we have recovered every 
possible penny for the victims said state comptroller gerald

a man arrested during a raid on a printing 
plant may be responsible for the millions of dollars in counterfeit 
us currency now flooding mexico the attorney generals office 
said thursday 
the bank of mexico told mexicans on wednesday not to buy us 
dollars from strangers and advised currency dealers to be on the 
lookout for bogus bills

northern chihuahua state last week and arrested a foreigner who said 
he sent counterfeit money to colombia home of the notorious

weekly since december authorities said thursday

resort of acapulco where agents arrested a peasant named jesus 
gomez hernandez as he allegedly tried to change 20 fake 100 bills 
for pesos at a foreign currency exchange house 
gomez said he bought the bills in morelos state from a stranger 
the guerrero state attorney generals office said 
on saturday agents confiscated 5 million in bogus bills and 
arrested at least four people in raids in tijuana across the border 
from san ysidro calif 
authorities suspect the source of the counterfeit may be a 
foreigner arrested during a printing plant raid in chihuahua he and

a b52 bomber carried a cigarshaped 
missile across northern canada on thursday in the first test of a 
us cruise missile designed with stealth technology officials said 
maj jan martinsen of the canadian forces cold lake air base in 
northeastern alberta said the bomber crossed an imaginary target at 
the nearby primrose lake evaluation range at 1115 am and then 
returned edwards air force base in california 
as far as we know everything proceeded smoothly she said 
the americans will obviously be analyzing the data theyve 
collected from this test 
the test had initially been set for wednesday but was delayed 
because of severe blizzard conditions in the northwest territories 
the missile remained attached to the bomber in what is called a 
captivecarry test such flights are used to check guidance systems 
the stealth cruise is an improved version of the airlaunched 
missiles that have been tested over northern canada for years it 
has stealth technology so it can better avoid detection and also has 
increased range and better accuracy 
its standard procedure prior to doing any freeflight rest to 
do a captivecarry mission where the unarmed missile remains 
attached to the b52 martinsen said 
canadas decision to allow testing of the advanced cruise drew 
protests from peace groups they said the missile is an offensive 
weapon that will fuel the arms race between the superpowers and 
ultimately create a need for a costly and complex canadian air 
defense system 
the canadian and us governments say the weapon is too slow to 
be a firststrike offensive weapon 
cruise testing here is carried out under an agreement signed with 
the united states in 1983 and renewed last year

police opened fire on rockthrowing 
mobs in caracas slums on thursday and witnesses said soldiers shot 
and killed at least 20 people in one area after snipers ambushed and 
killed an army major 
president carlos andres perez blamed leftists for continuing 
venezuelas worst unrest in 31 years of democratic rule 
el nacional an independent daily said in its friday edition 
that 300 people had been killed and 1500 injured in four days of 
rioting sparked by bus fare hikes the newspaper said the dead 
included at least four children ranging in age from 3 to 14 
that raised the toll from unofficial estimates thursday of 200 
dead and 800 injured in the rioting in the capital and at least 11 
cities nationwide 
perez said after a helicopter tour of capital thursday that the 
city of 4 million people was returning to normal 
witnesses said troops killed at least 20 people overnight in the 
el valle neighborhood south of caracas in response to the slaying of 
an army major by snipers 
maj felipe acosta carles was leading a group of soldiers in el 
valle wednesday when he followed snipers to a secluded hut next to a 
highway and was shot in a burst of gunfire according to press 
reports 
fransisco solorza a journalist who lives in the neighborhood 
said he saw at least 20 bodies being carried through the winding 
streets of the neighborhood thursday morning following nightlong 
gunbattles 
photographers for el nacional also said they saw at least 20 
bodies from that clash at the central caracas morgue 
about 100 people ran down hills in western caracas to shout 
taunts and throw stones at the police and national guard units the 
authorities opened fire dispersing the protesters 
no report of casualties was given from the clash which briefly 
closed two stations of the capitals subway system 
perez declared martial law and an overnight curfew beginning 
tuesday a day after increases in gasoline prices and transit fares 
touched off the violence 
an estimated 15000 troops and 7000 police maintained order in 
the capital thursday and the president pronounced the emergency 
practically over 
but perez said he was preoccupied and ashamed of the 
absurdity of lost lives 
he said looters were only hurting themselves by destroying small 
businesses that served poor neighborhoods and blamed remnants 
of leftist revolutionaries for continued gun battles in the capital 
these phantasmagorical remnants of subversives are still not 
convinced this is a democratic country said perez who has been 
in office only a month 
he said some acts were induced and this has to be punished 
severely 
on wednesday gabriel puerta a former guerrilla leader accused 
the government of inventing political motives for the disturbances 
which he blamed on the failure of the governments economic policies 
mourners some with black eyes and cuts from street violence 
waited outside the central caracas morgue thursday for the bodies of 
loved ones to be released 
armando rodriguez waited for the body of his 28yearold brother 
francisco who was killed by a stray bullet tuesday while watching 
looters battle the army from the roof of his building west of 
caracas 
we were up on the roof about 20 of us when the army arrived 
and started firing in the air to scare the mob rodriguez said 
i dont bear any grudges but i would like to see an investigation 
into my brothers death 
the unrest is the countrys worst since january 1958 when 100 
people were killed during the uprising that ousted dictator gen 
marcos perez jimenez 
venezuela affluent during the 1970s thanks to its rich oil 
reserves saw its fortunes slide along with petroleum prices in 1981 
real wages have since fallen by onethird inflation is expected 
to hit 70 percent this year double the 1988 figure and the 
foreign debt is 33 billion fourth largest in latin america after 
brazil mexico and argentina 
bus fare increases of 30 percent to 50 percent and price gouging 
by drivers were the immediate cause of the riots and looting 
two weeks ago perez announced a sweeping reform package under 
pressure from international creditors that includes lifting ceilings 
on interest rates doubling gas prices and letting the currency 
float which means higher prices for imports 
also thursday perez announced plans for emergency credits for 
storekeepers who lost millions from the damage and looting

congress should quit complaining about plans to 
close 86 us military installations and provide the money to 
dismantle them the cochairmen of a commission which came up with 
the plan said thursday 
in testimony before house and senate defense appropriations 
subcommittees former sen abraham ribicoff dconn and former 
rep jack edwards rala urged lawmakers to accept the 
baseclosing package even if it does have shortcomings 
once you start chipping away this thing goes down the tubes 
ribicoff told the house subcommittee if you stop the momentum 
from my political experience youre on the way to defeat 
critics of the commissions recommendations particularly 
lawmakers facing closings in their areas have complained that the 
findings are flawed 
for example rep edward madigan rill has said the commission 
erred in its assessment of chanute air force base one of the 
facilities recommended for shutdown 
the commission report suggests that the base has a shortage of 
recreational medical housing and warehousing facilities he 
said but base officials tell me that chanutes recreational 
facilities are among the best in the air force that the commission 
mistakenly underassessed the bases medical and dental capacity and 
that the base actually has a surplus of housing 
but edwards defended the commissions efforts 
we collected a vast amount of data describing conditions at 
thousands of installations we were asked to review he said we 
did not just pluck this list out of thin air 
the panel appointed last year by former defense secretary frank 
c carlucci recommended that the pentagon close 86 installations and 
partially shut five others estimated savings are 56 billion over 
20 years 
congress is scheduled to vote within weeks whether to accept or 
reject the plan it cannot pick or choose among bases to be closed 
and the closings can be blocked only if both the house and senate 
pass disapproval resolutions 
ribicoff acknowledged complaints such as those leveled by sen 
alan j dixon dill who said us overseas bases should have been 
reviewed with an eye toward closing before any domestic bases were 
considered 
my personal thinking is that bases overseas ought to be closed 
first ribicoff said but we were forbidden to undertake it 
he and edwards were making their second day of appearances in 
support of the commissions efforts to solve the politically 
sensitive issue of closing outmoded bases 
they appeared thursday before panels considering a defense 
department request to appropriate 500 million in fiscal 1990 for 
baseclosing expenses

seventyfive vietnamese returned by charter jet 
thursday to the communist homeland they fled and a report from 
hanoi said they were reprimanded upon arrival and told they faced 
prison if they left again 
the returnees were beginning the first repatriation program for 
boat people no longer willing to languish in crowded detention 
centers 
the englishlanguage south china morning post in a report from 
hanoi published friday vietnams director of immigration upbraided 
the boat people for leaving the country illegally 
officials told the group during a meeting at the airports 
immigration hall they could face 30 years in jail if they tried to 
flee again the paper said 
the boat people who were met by about 30 friends and relatives 
spent the night at a makeshift reception center near the vietnamese 
capitals airport the report said 
they were among about 11000 vietnamese who sailed into hong kong 
after this british colony adopted a tough new policy last year that 
for most of them rules out resettlement 
the 2hour flight marked the first largescale repatriation of 
boat people who have sailed by the tens of thousands to seek asylum 
in noncommunist southeast asia 
many of the returning 46 men 19 women and 10 children boarded 
the unchartered boeing 737 jet smiling waving and shaking hands 
with local officials several wore new clothes a few carried 
cassette tape players 
when their plane touched down in hanoi on thursday evening they 
were met by vietnamese british and un officials hong kong radio 
reported relief officials aboard the airplane said there was no 
tension during the flight it said 
im happy to be back lan bun see told reporters as he 
stepped off the plane this is my homeland i feel very 
happy the group was whisked to the passenger terminal by coach 
where they were rushed through immigration reports from hanoi said 
this is an important start said security branch official 
michael hanson who watched the group leave hong kong we hope 
more people will take this route back to vietnam and relieve the 
crowded camps that are home to about 26000 boat people in hong kong 
the repatriation was arranged under an agreement reached by 
vietnam and the un high commissioner for refugees hanoi promised 
not to prosecute its returning citizens and to allow the 
international organization to monitor their treatment back home 
the un commission agreed to provide assistance to the 
repatriated vietnamese returning adults received 50 and their 
children 25 according to un officials and other unspecified 
assistance will be offered 
two un officials flew back with the group and were expected to 
accompany the vietnamese to their hometowns 
hong kong about 500 miles north of vietnam long classified all 
arriving vietnamese as refugees who could stay in the colony until 
resettled elsewhere fewer than two dozen of the more than 120000 
vietnamese who have come to hong kong returned home between 1979 and 
1988 
but to stem a growing influx of boat people the colony adopted a 
new policy in june under which vietnamese are considered refugees 
only if they can prove they fled their homeland because of 
persecution 
the vast majority of the 11000 boat people who have arrived 
under the new policy do not meet that standard under a hong kong 
government screening program and are classified as illegal 
immigrants who fled their impoverished homeland for economic reasons 
hong kong wants to send them home forcibly but hanoi insists it 
will only accept boat people who want to return 
despite the new policy boat people continue to sail to the 
colony with 356 arriving last month up from 114 in january and 91 
in february 1988 
resettlement of the 15000 vietnamese in hong kong camps who have 
been granted refugee status have received a boost with several 
countries including the united states agreeing to increase the 
number they accept

president daniel ortega said thursday 
the violence shaking venezuela this week could happen at any time in 
latin america and urged the third world to deal jointly with the 
foreign debt problem 
ortega wrote venezuelas president carlos andres perez that the 
bloody riots in his country are the result of rigid policies and 
unjust economic relations by industrialized nations toward the 
third world 
today its venezuela tomorrow it could be brazil mexico 
argentina or any of the nations of latin america and the 
caribbean ortega said in his letter all of them are exposed to 
this jolt 
the letter to perez dated thursday was made available to news 
media 
rioting and looting in venezuelan cities have reportedly left at 
least 200 people dead and 1000 wounded violence hit after perezs 
government announced increases in the price of gasoline and public 
transport as part of measures demanded by the international 
monetary fund to restructure the economy 
it is time the governments unite to forge a common policy in 
the face of an onerous and unpayable foreign debt which limits our 
chances of development and the available resouces to satisfy the 
basic needs of our people ortega wrote 
he told perez he was deeply worried about the violence in 
venezuela 
we know this is the result of rigid policies and unjust 
economic relations that the industrialized nations and bodies such 
as the international monetary fund have been imposing on developing 
nations and particularly on the nations of latin america and the 
caribbean ortega said in his letter 
the leftist sandinista governments economic plan for 1989 
includes measures similar to those being put in place by venezuela 
to fight hyperinflation nicaraguan measures call for budget cuts of 
more than 40 percent laying off more than 30000 public employees 
and tightly restricting credit 
nicaraguas currency the cordoba has been devalued six times so 
far this year each time the price of gasoline and consequently 
food prices also rose 
no public protests have emerged because of the economic measures 
ortega on wednesday warned rightwing business executives in 
nicaragua and the yankee empire not to incite the nicaraguan 
people to insurrection saying they would be the first victims 
of an uprising

terry rakolta expected family television on the 
toprated primetime series married with children but was 
so offended by the offcolor humor in a recent episode that she sent 
her children out of the room 
although she thought she would be ignored rakolta was angry 
enough to stay up that night until 4 am writing to complain to 
advertisers about sexual innuendos and the treatment of women on the 
fox broadcasting co show 
now procter amp gamble co mcdonalds corp kimberlyclark corp 
and tambrands inc have told their advertising agencies not to buy 
time on the program which began in 1987 and is the most successful 
show on the fledgling fox network 
the president of cocacola usa ira herbert told rakolta in a 
letter that his company would screen the show more closely in the 
future 
i must tell you that i am corporately professionally and 
personally embarrassed that one of our commercials appeared in this 
particularly unsuitable program episode herbert wrote 
the results surprised rakolta 40 a resident of the affluent 
detroit suburb of bloomfield hills with daughters 18 10 and 9 and 
a son 8 her husband john is president of a construction company 
i am not an activist ive been involved in civic groups 
but nothing causeoriented she said in a telephone interview 
thursday 
that may change she said because she wants to start or join 
groups to organize national boycotts of advertisers with commercials 
on network television shows that have sexually oriented or violent 
scenes 
rakolta said the show she watched one sunday night in january 
with her son and younger daughters depicted a man visiting a 
lingerie store the show included references to vibrators an older 
man walking around in a garter belt and a woman in the store 
removing her bra for strangers she said 
i was thinking it was a family program because it was prime 
time 830 pm i was horrified she said 
fox which tries to attract young adult audiences in its effort 
to build a fourth television network has no trouble selling 
advertising time on the show which airs sunday evenings said fox 
spokesman brad turell in los angeles 
the show is completely sold out he said adding that reports 
of mrs rakoltas campaign have rallied support behind the show 
we have received literally hundreds of telephone calls today 
from across the country from viewers saying that this one womans 
opinion is getting too much attention and hoping that we wont 
change the show turell said 
rakolta says the key issue at stake is viewer choice not 
morality amid what she feels is a proliferation of such shows that 
restrict her familys viewing choices 
one person can really make a difference if they push the right 
buttons and the right buttons are not the producers in hollywood 
theyre the people that pay the money for the show she said 
married with children is a broadly played bluecollar 
comedy about a hapless shoe salesman his vain wife and their two 
borderline juvenile delinquent kids critics have favorably 
compared it to the honeymooners 
other fox officials defend the show don r bay a fox vice 
president wrote that the bundy family is a comedic counterpoint 
to other fictional television families who enjoy above average 
incomes greater opportunities and have more refined tastes 
gary lieberthal chairman of columbia pictures television 
producer of the series called it a parody of american life in a 
lower socioeconomic family 
an occasional episode may offend some people he wrote rakolta 
but hopefully many people though we know not all will be 
entertained by the outrageously absurd lives and offcenter values 
of the bundy family 
the american civil liberties union said thursday that those who 
seek to influence television content through pressure on advertisers 
are attempting censorship 
if you dont want to watch it then dont watch it said carol 
sobel an aclu attorney who has dealt with free speech issues i 
think what is inappropriate is to force your views on anyone else

britain said thursday it would not accept new 
iranian offers of negotiations until the islamic government 
renounces violence in the dispute over the novel the satanic 
verses 
iran however said it was britain that was making the overtures 
and that author salman rushdie remains subject to divine justice 
foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe meanwhile said he 
understood the book was deeply offensive to moslems and that it 
also offends britons by likening their country to nazi germany 
the foreign office said it had been contacted wednesday and 
thursday by the iranian foreign ministry proposing a meeting in 
geneva this week 
the iranians according to a foreign office spokesman said they 
wished to discuss a resolution passed tuesday by the majlis that 
gave britain a week to back away from its defense of rushdie 
otherwise diplomatic relations would be severed 
we saw no merit to a meeting at this stage said the 
spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity they would have to 
renounce violence or the threat of it that is absolutely 
cardinal 
that apparently means britain would expect iran to renounce the 
death sentence pronounced against rushdie by irans spiritual leader 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini on feb 14 iranian clergymen have 
offered bounties up to 52 million for rushdies death 
following the foreign office statements the iranian news agency 
irna quoted a foreign ministry source as saying britain proposed 
talks and was rebuffed 
howe said in an interview on bbc radio that he could empathize 
with moslems feeling offended by book which he said is offensive 
in many other ways as well 
we are not upholding the right of freedom to speak because we 
like the book because we agree with the book he said 
the british government the british people do not have any 
affection for the book the book is extremely critical rude about 
us it compares britain with hitlers germany 
so we are not sponsoring the book what we are sponsoring is 
the right of people to speak freely to publish freely he said 
rushdie is also critical in his book of prime minister margaret 
thatcher and her conservative policies 
howe plans to meet in vienna on monday with soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze who has indicated a willingness to 
mediate 
since khomeini condemned rushdie britain and its 11 european 
economic community partners have withdrawn their envoys from tehran 
and irans top diplomat left london 
the soviets official tass news agency in a commentary 
wednesday acknowledged the concern of western countries about death 
threats but defended khomeini 
perhaps imam khomeini the supreme religious authority in iran 
had no choice proceeding from koran teachings other than denouncing 
a man who has insulted islam tass diplomatic correspondent vadim 
biryukov wrote 
the denunciation was nothing more by the way than the 
position of a religious leader he wrote the iranian government 
has not condemned rushdie to death 
a similar line had been taken by irans charge daffaires in 
britain mohammad basti shortly before khomeini quashed diplomatic 
efforts by reaffirming the death sentence 
at one point iranian president ali khamenei had said that 
rushdie might save himself by apologizing and iranian diplomats 
reacted positively to statements by their british counterparts that 
thatchers government had no role in publishing the satanic 
verses 
the latest overtures from tehran apparently reflect continuing 
divisions within the iranian government between shiite moslem 
hardliners and more moderate elements who seek warmer ties with 
the west 
rushdie a native of india who is now a british citizen is 
reportedly in hiding in britain with his american wife the zurich 
weekly zuriwoche quoting sources identified only as literary 
circles said in its society column that rushdie has fled to 
switzerland 
in cairo egypts nobel prizewinning author naguib mahfouz in a 
newspaper interview published thursday urged moslem countries to 
condemn irans death sentence but proposed a boycott of viking 
penguin which published the satanic verses 
in stockholm thursday swedens nobel prizeawarding literary 
academy defended free speech but did not explicitly support rushdie 
the academy had been under pressure from literary and other 
organizations to take a clear stand for rushdie 
most of its members however have individually expressed strong 
indignation at the campaign against rushdie 
moslem demonstrators blocked roads and burned effigies of rushdie 
on thursday in indias bengal state and the united news of india 
said 50 people were arrested 
the book has been banned in iran senegal lebanon saudi arabia 
jordan syria egypt south africa brunei pakistan bangladesh and 
kenya and 18 people have died in protests in india and pakistan 
moslems say the satanic verses is blasphemous because it 
portrays the prophet mohammeds wives as prostitutes and suggests 
that mohammed not god was the source for the koran islams holy 
book 
at the united nations a security council diplomat said the world 
body would not stand up for rushdie for fear of offending iran and 
jeopardizing forthcoming iraniraq peace talks

former alderman edward r vrdolyak who launched a 
writein campaign less than a week before the republican mayoral 
primary apparently defeated the gopenorsed candidate a city 
election official said thursday 
vrdolyak totaled 11621 votes or 525 percent to 10478 votes 
or 474 percent for dr herbert sohn who had the partys backing 
said ray jagielski one of three members of the chicago board of 
election commissioners 
its a great victory for all of the people that voted for me 
vrdolyak said at the elections board its not a personal victory 
for me 
when youre going over uncharted waters a writein campaign 
you know its going to be hard and you dont know what to expect 
but if the people can spell vrdolyak or close to it it was just 
wonderful 
four of the citys 2911 precincts remained uncounted and all 
ballots must be reviewed before the winner is certified by the board 
on tuesday 
vrdolyak also apparently had a large enough lead to prevent sohn 
from finishing within 5 percentage points which would entitle him 
to a socalled discovery recount an automatic recount of 25 
percent of the precincts 
sohn will ask a judge to order a discovery recount said sohns 
campaign manager chris robling by law the results of such a 
recount may be used only to seek a courtordered recount of all 
ballots 
if we dont get the discovery recount we will look for other 
ways to show a judge the count was improper said burton odleson 
sohns attorney well find and interview election judges 
precinct workers and others if need be 
the gop winner named by the commissioners will face two other 
candidates in the april 4 general election in this traditionally 
democratic city 
richard m daley son of the late legendary boss of chicago 
politics defeated mayor eugene sawyer in the democratic primary 
tuesday sawyers chief black rival alderman timothy evans is 
running a thirdparty challenge on the harold washington party 
ticket named for the citys first black mayor who died in 1987 
during his second term 
daley was vacationing in florida but his press secretary avis 
lavelle dismissed vrdolyaks influence on the general election 
we dont view him as any particular threat lavelle said i 
dont think he will hurt anybody very much 
evans agreed it doesnt mean anything to me frankly he 
said 
both vrdolyak 51 and sohn 61 had said they expected to 
challenge the results in court and had retained seasoned election 
attorneys a court fight conceivably could delay the general 
election 
though both vrdolyak and sohn like daley are white political 
observers said only vrdolyak had the potential to draw off a 
significant number of voters from daleys core constituency of 
ethnic whites 
sohn like most real republicans in chicago has only a small 
following and would barely cause a ripple eddie cant win but he 
could cause some real mischief said tom roesser a veteran 
political analyst active in republican and civic circles 
nearly 25000 republican ballots were cast in the citys 2911 
precincts tuesday about 10000 more than in 1987 
vrdolyak a former county democratic party chairman and alderman 
has lost his last two tries for elected office he ran an 
unsuccessful thirdparty bid for mayor in 1987 and lost last fall as 
the gop candidate for clerk of the cook county circuit court 
but he did receive about 80 percent of the white vote in 1987 
against washington 
one political observer said that vrdolyaks campaign would not 
make much difference to either evans or daley 
daley will win it anyway vrdolyak will only draw white votes 
away from daley if people are sure theyre not endangering the 
chance of a white candidate winning said paul kleppner a 
northern illinois university professor and author of chicago 
divided the making of a black mayor

leftist guerrillas late thursday 
attacked a military post in a residential neighborhood outside the 
capital killing at least three soldiers and two civilians 
the attack comes just one day after the armed forces said it was 
beginning a threemonth ceasefire in the conflict with the rebels 
guerrillas attacked just before sunset firing four antitank 
rockets at the stateowned antel telephone switching station in san 
ramon on the northwestern edge of the city 
the attack on the telephone facility which caused no casualties 
and slight damage to a brick wall appeared to be diversonary 
minutes later about 10 blocks away a firefight erupted at the 
san ramon civil defense post where about 20 soldiers were stationed 
several dozen soldiers from the 1st armybbrigade on duty nearby 
advanced toward the post and the exchange escalated into a fierce 
battle that lasted for nearly an hour 
panicked residents threw themselves on the ground behind walls 
parked vehicles and piles of bricks and cinderblock at a masonry 
supply business along the route of the soldiers advance 
commie dogs show yourselves cowards shouted some of the 
soldiers as they advanced running crouched and pausing every few 
yards to survey the scene aim and fire 
an air force helicopter flew over the battle but did not open 
fire 
journalists saw at least three dead soldiers being loaded onto a 
truck two civilians one of them an adolescent boy also were 
killed 
there are lots of dead said one young soldier to a 
journalist 
several soldiers were wounded but there was no official count as 
of thursday night 
there was no immediate indication of guerrilla casualties 
earlier thursday leftist rebels said the army is violating its 
own ceasefire by moving into territory controlled by the guerrillas 
that demonstrates the falsehood of the supposed ceasefire 
said the insurgents clandestine radio venceremos 
a top colonel said the army has the legal and moral 
obligation to defend against guerrilla attacks despite the 
ceasefire 
radio venceremos did not mention fighting as a result of army 
troop movements in the northern zones of morazan san miguel and 
chalatenango provinces it only said the army had physically entered 
rebel territory 
the northern sectors of the three provinces are dominated by 
leftist rebels waging a 9yearold revolution against the 
usbacked government 
the armed forces on wednesday began what they said was a 
threemonth cessation of offensive operations designed to provide 
conditions for peace talks the government of president jose 
napoleon duarte has called on the rebels to respond in kind 
the rebels said wednesday they were willing to declare a 
ceasefire once a time place and agenda for peace talks is agreed 
upon 
the guerrillas have said they will participate in and respect the 
outcome of this years presidential election if it is postponed from 
march 19 until september 
the guerrillas have accused the government of procrastinating in 
response to their peace overture 
the government and armed forces have lacked seriousness in the 
way they have dealt with our proposal and the expectations it has 
created that could harm prospects for a good outcome of the search 
for peace the rebel broadcast said thursday 
the us state department said the rebels refusal to declare a 
unilateral ceasefire called into question the sincerity of their 
stated desire for peace 
the rebels have continued attacks they wounded three national 
guardsmen wednesday night in an assault in tejutepeque in the 
northern province of cabanas 
a ceasefire does not mean the armed forces relinquishes its 
constitutional duty of defending sovereignty and ensuring security 
tranquility and stability col mauricio vargas commander of the 
eastern region said in a televised interview wednesday night 
if people are up in arms in any part of the nations territory 
we have the legal and moral obligation to fight them he said

hospital 
the two men tried to force grant to open a safe that was in the 
house but he was too nervous the police sources said the safe 
contained about 4000 and some jewelry the sources said

and believed he had money 
grant leaped out the same window as his wife as one of the gunmen 
scooped up the baby said mayronne 
the abductors called the family home three times demanding the 
money and jewelry in the safe a ransom drop at the subway station 
was set up but the kidnapers fled around 730 am minutes before

by a plainclothes police officer exchanged the baby for a bag of 
ranson

the new social democratic party said 
wednesday that hungary should end oneparty rule and turn itself 
into a westernstyle welfare state that is both independent and 
neutral 
demands for a multiparty system greater human rights and 
sweeping reform of the penal code were made at a meeting to recruit 
new members to the party reestablished itself in january after a 
40year pause 
the party was dissolved when the communists came to power in 1948 
the ruling communist party endorsed a multiparty system for the 
first time early last month but stressed the transition to more 
pluralism should be gradual and orderly 
 
about 600 people listened to speeches by members of a provisional 
sixmember presidium in an engineering company meeting hall none of 
the presidium members is well known except the president andras 
revesz 79 
a party program distributed at wednesdays meeting advocates 
parliamentary democracy full human rights elimination of military 
blocs and an independent neutral hungary 
speakers challenged the communist party monopoly in every aspect 
of life particularly its control of the judiciary and media 
presidium member tibor baranyai said the group wants to join the 
socialist international he and others called for trade union 
pluralism and praised social democratic policies developed by willy 
brandt former chancellor of west germany and former chancellor 
bruno kreisky of austria 
several speakers including baranyai warned of communist 
infiltration and influence in the new party 
perhaps because of those fears the leadership has decided that 
until the first party congress late this year or early next the 
presidium will include only people who belonged to the social 
democratic party abolished during communist takeover in 194849 
the hungarian parliament which is increasingly outspoken is to 
pass a bill legalizing alternative political parties by aug 1 if 
hungary implements genuine powersharing it would be the first east 
bloc country to have a bona fide multiparty system 
 
dozens of independent groups have formed in hungary over the past 
year several of which are likely to become political parties in 
addition to the social democratic party the smallholders party also 
announced its return after 40 years

a northwest orient dc10 bound from frankfurt west 
germany to boston with 232 aboard made an emergency landing in 
london wednesday after an engine stalled then continued on when 
mechanics gave it a clean bill of health 
the plane landed at gatwick airport on two of its three engines 
said an airport spokesman who spoke anonymously 
northwest orient spokesman andy plews said the no 2 engine 
stalled on takeoff from frankfurt west germany and instead of 
trying to restart the engine in flight the captain decided to divert 
to london gatwick 
the 222 passengers and 10 crew aboard flight 47 disembarked 
normally after the landing an airline statement said 
mechanics checked out the engine on the tarmac running it up to 
full power in a test and discovered that there was no problem with 
it plews said 
the plane continued on its flight 5 hours after landing in 
london 
he said northwest orient doesnt know why the engine failed but 
it is possible for engines to do this occasionally it could be a 
lack of air flow through the engine which can be caused by an 
atmospheric condition 
in a separate development on wednesday brian lavers an aircraft 
surveyor for britains civil aviation authority criticized airlines 
for paying too little attention to corrosion 
lavers told a conference of about 100 experts at gleneagles in 
scotland that airlines and others responsible for aircraft 
maintenance showed a continuing apparent reluctance to make the 
small extra investment in tackling the problem 
lavers reported that the belly areas of transport planes were 
allowed to remain wet and dirty retaining a mixture which acted 
like wet blotting paper and defeated anticorrosion coatings 
the us air transport association said monday that hundreds of 
repairs were needed on certain aging airliners if more than 1000 
airplanes are to keep flying the repairs would cost hundreds of 
millions of dollars

the massachussetts institute of technology yale university and duke 
university this week he also was to meet with president bush and 
former president reagan during the 14day trip 
it is very regretful and i must apologize for causing trouble 
to the people who invited me nakasone said in a nationally 
televised interview but i guess a politician has to expect 
something like this to happen 
nakasone has been linked to the scandal in which hiromasa ezoe 
founder of recruit co an information and publishing conglomerate 
sold unlisted shares in a subsidiary to more than 150 people at 
bargain prices share prices shot up once they were listed publicly

used to purchase yearend and summer greetings gifts 
nakasones link to the affair was brought to light after it was 
revealed three of his aides earned more than 640000 in profits by 
selling their shares 
opposition parties claiming nakasone played a key role in the 
affair have demanded the government call the former twoterm prime 
minister to parliament for questioning

opposition parties are demanding he be summoned to parliament and be 
questioned said osamu yatabe a parliamentarian from the largest 
opposition group the japan socialist party 
eight people including ezoe have been arrested and accused of 
bribery and violating the securities law

cabinet ministers has caused a public uproar and severely damaged 
the credibility of prime minister noboru takeshitas administration

the state agreed wednesday to encourage 
desegregation throughout arkansas and pay more than 100 million to 
settle a 6yearold federal desegregation case brought by the little 
rock school district 
the proposed settlement involving the state and all three school 
districts in pulaski county was signed by attorneys for all the 
parties before us district judge henry woods 
the mostly black little rock school district sued the state and 
the neighboring mostly white north little rock and pulaski county 
special school districts in federal court six years ago alleging 
the defendants caused illegal segregation in little rock schools 
woods found north little rock and pulaski county liable and 
ordered the districts merged but the 8th us circuit court of 
appeals affirming woods liability ruling said his proposed 
countywide consolidation was too severe 
instead the appeals court ordered the boundary line between the 
little rock and pulaski county districts redrawn moving large 
mostly white sections of the city of little rock which were in the 
county district into the city district north little rock was not 
affected 
the appeals court then asked the district judge to consider how 
much the state would have to pay to fund compensatory programs in 
the three districts especially little rock this led to the 
settlement 
if the agreement is approved by woods the state would be 
released as a defendant in the case final approval would need to 
come from woods all three school boards involved the legislature 
and the state board of education no hearing was set 
robin armstrong little rock school board president said she was 
pleased with the settlement and sheryl dunn a member of the 
pulaski county school board called it a momentous occasion 
the terms of the settlement under which the state will pay out 
more than 100 million include 
the state must pay the little rock district 591 million over 
10 years for compensatory education programs and other desegregation 
expenses and the north little rock district 27 million in seven 
annual payments also for compensatory education 
the state must pay 7 million to the pulaski county district by 
july 1 plus an additional 67 million by july 1 1990 if the 
legislature raises state revenues during the current session if no 
additional revenues are raised the district would get 16 million 
over five years 
the state must block construction of any school in a county 
bordering pulaski county if the new school would hurt desegregation 
of schools in pulaski county 
state officials must recommend to the legislature repeal of all 
laws impeding desegregation and not to propose any new ones that 
would have that effect 
the state must recruit black teachers for all three districts 
and push for legislation to help minority students enroll in 
teachereducation programs at college

less than 30 percent of taxpayers have filed 
their returns halfway into the filing season but the pace is still 
ahead of last years 
the internal revenue service said wednesday that through feb 24 
it had received 308 million returns up 2 percent over the 
comparable period of 1988 when 302 million were received 
the number of taxpayers filing the long form 1040 most of whom 
itemize deductions dropped 42 percent the irs said but the 
number filing the short form 1040a and the onepage 1040ez rose 
75 percent and 68 percent this years figures include 131 
million long forms 85 million form 1040a and 91 million form 
1040ez 
the irs read the figures as suggesting that many taxpayers who 
filed form 1040 in the past may be switching to the simpler shorter 
forms

a national research council report that said 
vitamin pills and some other dietary supplements are useless and 
perhaps harmful was denounced as a disservice to all americans 
by a trade group 
the group called the council for responsible nutrition said 
that the nrc report released wednesday failed to acknowledge what it 
called emerging research on benefits from supplements of 
vitamins fiber and calcium 
the nrc report provides only a shallow review of the evidence 
on the benefits of nutritional supplements and fails to reflect the 
tide of research that supports those benefits the trade 
association said in a prepared statement 
the nrc on wednesday released a 1300page report that is a 
compilation by 19 experts of research from many sources related to 
diet and health the threeyear study concluded that health is best 
maintained by a balanced diet of a variety of foods in a diet that 
is reduced in fat and salt and enriched with fruits vegetables and 
complex carbohydrates 
the study said the nrc committee found no conclusive evidence 
that taking doses of supplemental vitamins fiber or calcium would 
provide protection from cancer heart disease embrittlement of 
bones or other ailments

mayor tom bradley proudly calls los angeles 
the new ellis island where waves of immigrants have produced 
amazing cultural diversity 
but increasingly schools courts and businesses throughout 
southern california are struggling to cope with scores of languages 
that threaten to create a metropolitan babel 
examples abound 
the los angeles unified school district tries to teach most 
courses in the students native languages until they develop fluency 
in english the task is monumental 160000 students have as their 
primary tongues more than 80 languages from afghan afrikaans and 
amharic to urdu yoruba and yiddish 
during last years fire in the citys tallest skyscraper 
emergency announcements were in english and largely useless nearly 
all the 50 people in the building that night were janitors who spoke 
only spanish 
in orange county commonly associated with surfers and 
disneyland minorities make up more than 40 percent of public school 
students and a recent poll found the 100000 vietnamese residents 
felt their top need was englishlanguage classes 
police in the orange county cities of westminster and garden 
grove have recruited vietnamese speakers to investigate tightknit 
asian gangs the santa ana school district had to turn away about 
half the 800 spanishspeakers who waited in line some overnight to 
sign up for english courses 
tens of thousands of soviet armenians and jews have poured into 
the area in recent years as the soviet union relaxed emigration 
policies overwhelmed social workers say the refugees must be 
educated quickly or risk becoming permanently dependent on the 
government 
the number of refugees streaming into los angeles county from 
around the world has tripled since 1985 reaching a high of 19011 
in 1988 but federal funds to help the newcomers dropped from 71 
million in 1985 to 28 million last year 
in glendale for decades another white suburban bastion a 
survey last spring found that 545 percent of the students in city 
schools came from homes where english was not the primary language 
more than 60 languages were spoken 
on rare occasions the problems can be comical glendale teacher 
matilda mardirossian was glad that michael dukakis lost the 
election not because of politics but because of his name which is 
pronounced the same as an offcolor phrase in armenian the first 
language spoken by many of her students 
they were giggling over his name she said i definitely 
didnt want to hear it for the next four years 
most skirmishes in the war of words are more serious 
last month executive life insurance co dropped an englishonly 
rule for employees rather than fight a civil rights suit filed by 
the local chapter of the american civil liberties union and the 
asian pacific american legal center of southern california 
los angeles and california as a state are at a turning point 
as far as being a global center of many cultures said stewart 
kwoh the founder of the legal center and while english is the 
principal language through which we converse it is not going to be 
possible for us to play a leadership role if we cannot accept other 
languages and cultures 
but acceptance can come slowly in cities like monterey park 10 
miles east of downtown los angeles the city of 62000 became known 
as the first suburban chinatown or the chinese beverly hills 
as asians many of them affluent supplanted anglos and hispanics as 
the majority group 
most signs along the atlantic boulevard business strip are now in 
chinese as well as english with ai hoa supermarket and bank of 
canton of california competing for attention with security pacific 
bank and pic n save chineselanguage newspapers outnumber english 
papers in sidewalk news racks 
monterey park mayor barry l hatch has loudly called for a ban on 
immigration into the united states supports a law making english 
the official us language and crusades against nonenglish books 
at the library 
monterey park is a beautiful little suburban town almost rural 
in some parts and now we drive through our little commercial area 
and feel like were in hong kong he said when youre an anglo 
or hispanic and you cant read the signs it makes you feel like a 
secondclass citizen 
other nearby cities have reacted with laws dictating how much 
english must appear on signs temple city 100 percent in english 
downtown 50 percent in outlying areas arcadia 70 percent 
pomona and rosemead 50 percent 
historically immigrants have come to america with the 
understanding theyre going to have to give up their primary 
language hatch said now were looking at floods of immigrants 
who say to hell with the process well do it our way 
inevitably disputes wind up in court 
one lawsuit that failed in state court in 1987 wanted the los 
angeles school district to immediately provide english classes to 
40000 foreign language speakers despite the fact that 200000 
people already were enrolled in such classes and the district said 
state funds for them had run out 
a suit pending in federal court contends aliens are deprived of 
their rights in southern california immigration courts by inept 
interpreters and a practice of translating only parts of deportation 
hearings 
seven people worked as translators for los angeles county courts 
in 1962 today 453 do interpreting 70 languages and dialects with 
257 spanish translators by far the most numerous 
ed johnson director of interpretertranslator services said 
about 300 interpreters work in the countys municipal and superior 
courts on a typical day the 1962 translation budget was about 
30000 he said this years is about 6 million 
sophia zahler who heads the federal court translation service 
here says spanish speakers account for 95 percent of interpreters 
used in federal courts nationwide but in california the other 
category jumps to 20 percent with demand for korean tagalog thai 
armenian cantonese mandarin farsi hebrew and even tongan 
some profit by the linguistic gridlock such as accentreduction 
teachers who charge 60 to 85 a session for a dozen individual 
sessions there are hundreds of takers 
others see benefits in language differences 
at edison elementary school in a hispanic section of santa 
monica kindergarten and first grade pupils are taught in spanish 
except for one oral english class regardless of whether students 
parents speak english or spanish englishlanguage classes are 
gradually added working up to a 5050 language mix in sixth grade 
the edison school project assumes that both hispanics and 
anglos will emerge competent in both languages said russell n 
campbell a ucla linguistics professor 
similar programs may be set up in koreatown little tokyo or 
chinatown but campbell acknowledged they will remain special 
it just isnt possible in a class where a teacher is facing 15 
kids who speak different languages he said and what do we do 
about those classes with the single kid who speaks lao or hmong

this reviewer was under the impression during 
the interminable hours it took to slog through day one that it 
must be a threepart miniseries 
what a surprise to realize its only three hours long day 
one airs on one day sunday on cbs 
certainly a movie about the development of the abomb the 
manhattan project as it was called sounded like it had a lot of 
potential the race against time the dangerous testing and most 
importantly the deep moral questions about developing so 
destructive a weapon 
unfortunately the script by producer david rintels based on 
peter wydens book day one before hiroshima and after is 
deadly dull 
to his credit rintels avoids pat answers and explores complex 
questions was it really necessary to bomb japan to end world war 
ii or did congress just want to see the bang that 2 billion worth 
of taxpayers bucks had bought 
and rintels refuses to junk up an inherently dramatic true story 
with a lot of phony madefortv love interests and subplots 
its just that it takes extremely good writing to turn historical 
accuracy into drama especially when the story is mostly talk and 
little action 
its also difficult following all the characters much of the 
story winds through the washington bureaucracy a narration might 
have helped eliminating the need for awkward unlikely dialogue to 
explain identities such as youre the supreme commander of the 
allied forces that won the war of course hell care what you 
think 
the movie does boast an impressive cast including hume cronyn 
and barnard hughes in supporting roles brian dennehy and david 
strathairn do their level best with the two leads 
dennehy plays gen leslie groves a military disciplinarian in 
charge of the manhattan project who had little use for scientists 
standing around all day kibbitzing about fission and implosion 
there is an interesting relationship between groves and his 
seeming opposite the intellectual dr robert oppenheimer 
strathairn who impresses the general with his bluntness michael 
tucker is admirably sympathetic as leo szilard the german scientist 
who turned against the bomb that he was instrumental in creating 
but pair rintels script with joseph sargents unimaginative 
direction and no acting can save scene after plodding scene of 
talking heads spouting platitudes 
its about our responsibility for the development of this most 
terrible weapon by which modern civilization could be completely 
wiped out secretary of war henry stimson hughes explains to 
president harry truman richard dysart but on the other hand if 
the problem of proper use of this weapon can be solved well have 
the opportunity to save world peace and our civilization 
groves talks to oppenheimer szilard talks to the secretary of 
state oppenheimer talks to szilard oppenheimer and groves talk to 
the cabinet 
this wordiness is relieved only occasionally when the scientists 
at the research center in los alamos stand on a sand dune and blow 
up an iron pipe then run over to examine it 
rintels tries to build suspense leading up to the first test 
detonation a potentially riveting moment with endless discussion 
of the weather which is about as suspenseful as endless discussion 
of the weather 
when the first mushroom cloud ever ignites the desert sky one of 
the scientists exclaims its brighter than a star its 
brighter than two stars groves adds 
the dropping of the bomb on hiroshima is portrayed through use of 
archival footage then there is an almostpowerful scene when the 
scientists who developed the bomb and cheered its success see slides 
of the devastation it has wrought but by then unfortunately 
viewers will be too bored to be moved

david rintels the producer and writer of cbs 
day one was 7 years old in 1945 the year the first atomic bomb 
tumbled out of the enola gay and plummeted toward hiroshima 
what i remember was that the war was ending and that peoples 
fathers including mine were coming home it was wonderful 
rintels recalled and i dont think a lot of people immediately 
thought much beyond that so its kind of startling to realize as 
you go back through the record that a lot of the people who were 
involved in the decision had a very different point of view 
drawn to history with the dirtunderthefingernails 
determination of an archaeologist rintels uses the past not to 
propel steamy chronicles of passion and greed but as day one 
demonstrates to explore what interesting people do when placed in 
difficult circumstances 
day one a threehour cbs movie airing sunday is about the 
building and dropping of the bomb on japan 
rintels focuses on those individuals who both triumphed in and 
agonized over the creation of fat man and little boy the names of 
the abombs dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki we didnt muck it 
up with love stories and red herrings and false drama rintels 
said god knows its an important and dramatic enough story 
without trickery 
for rintels as both an emmywinning writer fear on trial 
clarence darrow and television producer it is a familiar 
approach 
in gideons trumpet he examined the criminal justice system 
through a semiliterate suspects eyes 
with choices of the heart rintels sifted through the life of 
jean donovan an american lay missionary raped and killed in el 
salvador 
and in sakharov he presented a nonideological look at the 
soviet system and its effect on the countrys leading dissident 
if his projects are united by one theme rintels said it is one 
which embraces historical integrity and rejects bias 
the argument over docudrama that is fought so vociferously 
always has to do with accuracy rintels said but that is far 
less important in my way of thinking than is fairness to all sides 
you could be absolutely accurate and be loaded so much on one side 
or another that youve distorted the real truth 
yet you cant know the truth of everything its not known to 
anybody least of all a guy like me whos trying to dramatize things 
where there are frequently conflicting accounts or no accounts 
i dont believe in some kinds of whatif drama like what if 
ruby hadnt killed oswald and there was a trial or what if george 
custer had been courtmartialed i dont like those kinds of shows 
thats makebelieve but heres a show in which there was conflict 
and ambiguity and they came out with a clear decision some people 
think that it was not only the right decision but it was also 
absolutely inevitable 
but it wasnt absolutely inevitable a different president a 
different adviser i think the decision to drop the bomb could 
have come out differently 
day one presents both sides of the atomic bomb dilemma with 
equal fervor 
a lot of people say if youd been there what would you have 
done and i dont know rintels said if i was there in what 
capacity if i was a general or a scientist or a politician one 
of the most interesting things about this show that i found was that 
nobody has a corner on either wisdom or patriotism 
its not the conventional good guybad guy white hatblack hat 
drama it doesnt reduce it to that kind of simplicity at least i 
feel it doesnt ambiguity or complexity is better drama 
in day one gen leslie groves brian dennehy is asked to 
organize a team of scientists to build an atomic weapon j robert 
oppenheimer david strathairn is willing to lead the effort but 
fellow physicist leo szilard michael tucker is haunted by the 
manhattan projects moral implications szilard lobbies to stop the 
weapon he helped start 
what was most surprising to me i guess was that the debate 
about whether to drop the bomb was as dramatic and interesting and 
relevant and human as it really was rintels said it feels like 
a contemporary immediate debate i think most people have the idea 
that there was not a lot of discussion that the bomb was dropped 
to end the war bang 
the definition of drama i love best is to take people you 
really care about and put them in situations that are hard to 
handle because history can be dry but if you get people flesh 
and blood with real emotions with a lot at stake and you can get 
other people involved in that thats a lot better than blackboard 
teaching

in contrast to the conservative 
producedtoapolish and totally predictable managers who occupy the 
executive suite in many mature companies the founder was probably 
simple direct and unpredictable 
that was jb fuqua founder of fuqua industries and until he 
eased himself out of the positions recently its chairman and chief 
executive officer 
jb now 70 is an original which makes his legacy especially 
vital and meaningful today when so many corporate messages are 
crafted by publicists to impress a particular audience or create a 
public image 
this is part of his message distilled from a commencement 
address at oglethorpe university in 1986 and perhaps a rare and 
oldfashioned model for other corporate chairmen now preparing to 
address the 1989 graduating classes 
the subject was success and leadership 
attaining ones goals however modest they may be is success 
for that individual according to fuqua there is no more 
successful a person than one who becomes a good teacher and is 
dedicated to conveying knowledge 
ambition and leadership are much the same although one must 
first be ambitious to become a leader he said he added it 
occurs to me that we have fewer people today than at any time in my 
memory who are actually ambitious 
leaders he said always want to be at the head of the line 
they think big thoughts they avoid a lot of trivia and they just 
dont waste precious time they are curious they learn how to use 
books 
the best way to be a success and a leader is to act like one 
choose those people who are successful and imitate them getting 
ahead of the crowd can be almost that simple 
one thing you will notice about successful people he said is 
that they have better personal habits than the crowd they dress 
better they dont smoke they dont abuse drugs or alcohol they 
are careful of health 
when fuqua started out he had little money moreover he was very 
young he was a radio engineer at 19 part owner of a radio station 
at 21 he learned to dress well 
i dressed better than my peers because i knew i didnt have any 
experience and had a limited education but by dressing better i was 
confident i could make a good first impression he said 
if you dont remember anything else i say today he told the 
students i hope you will remember this youll never have a 
second chance to make a first impression 
leaders work longer hours by working just 10 hours a week more 
than average you gain three months more experience in just one year 
and in only four years youve picked up an additional whole year 
manners count learn to say thank you sincerely every time 
there is any excuse for doing it be punctual be courageous 
one of the great opportunities we have in this country is the 
opportunity to make a mistake 
leaders are accessible ive always said im going to talk to 
everyone who phones me because santa claus might call one day and i 
dont want to miss him 
leaders learn early that we all have two ears and two eyes but 
only one mouth we dont learn anything while we are talking the 
only help your mouth can give you in learning may be in asking the 
right questions 
finally never succumb to the weakness of saying you are just one 
person and dont amount to very much 
individuals are the only important people there are the world 
only recognizes individuals nowhere in atlanta will you find a 
single monument erected to a committee 
but he added being an individual doesnt mean you need to be 
just a common individual an ordinary person 
fuqua personally involved in every operation of his consumer 
products and service business from its beginning in 1968 to is 
present eminence on the new york stock exchange was famous for 
unique leadership 
at one point he faced criticism for shrinking the company when 
growth was in vogue his individuality and courage were vindicated 
however when the profits went up

in the bustling markets that line the 
narrow winding alleys and the muddy kabul river war always seems 
just around the corner 
tanks with their guns fixed and armored personnel carriers block 
intersections 
young soldiers clutching kalashnikov rifles in one hand and 
plastic prayer beads in the other patrol the streets and stand guard 
on rooftops 
helicopter gunships chug along the snowcovered mountains lined 
with radar installations 
the moslem guerrillas battling the forces of afghanistans 
sovietstyle government are hiding beyond the ridges that form a 
bowl around kabul the capital city of 225 million they 
periodically launch a few rockets into the capital 
theres little feeling of imminent danger in the marketplaces 
where merchants wrapped in tattered brown shawls and dingy white 
turbans sit crosslegged on the ground in front of huge piles of 
fruits and vegetables 
but rumor and speculation are as plentiful now as russian caviar 
and vodka were before the soviet army pulled out last month 
its the weather they the guerrillas are waiting for 
spring said one vendor zahir 
its the shura added another ibrahim referring to a 
guerrilla meeting in pakistan and suggesting the fighters are too 
preoccupied setting up a governmentinexile to launch major 
assaults 
moscow pulled out the last of its 115000 troops and ended its 
nineyear military involvement in afghanistan on feb 15 leaving 
the afghan forces alone to battle the usbacked guerrillas 
the departure of the last soviet soldier passed without much 
notice in afghanistan most people seemed more concerned about food 
shortages and the lack of fuel to heat their mud brick homes on the 
freezing winter nights 
there were no official ceremonies and only the barest 
acknowledgment by the kabul government of the kremlins involvement 
in a war that killed 13000 soviet soldiers 
the soviets have worked tenaciously to ensure that a friendly 
government remains in power in kabul and they have backed several 
ineffective measures aimed at drawing the rebels into a coalition 
government 
president najib outlined what he called a government of national 
reconciliation urging unity with the guerrillas who have battled 
the kabul regime since a few party members engineered an april 1978 
coup and began trying to radically alter the economic social 
political and religious life of afghanistan 
the guerrillas rejected najibs peace overtures and vowed to 
destroy his government 
the president has in turn tightened his grip on power 
he declared a state of emergency and suspended many individual 
rights he purged his cabinet of some members who were not from his 
peoples democratic party of afghanistan replacing them with his 
most trusted advisers and he placed the fate of the country in the 
hands of a 21member military council 
the government said the actions did not close the door to 
negotiations with the guerrillas 
we have to move more cautiously now than ever but we still 
want negotiations we want a rainbow coalition that represents all 
segments of afghan society said abdul fatah weidi the foreign 
ministrys information chief 
some diplomats and observers believe the guerrillas may be on the 
threshold of power 
but bitter divisions among the guerrilla factions are evident 
with some supporting establishment of a strict islamic republic and 
others supporting a more broadbased government 
many observers believe a power struggle similar to that which has 
plagued najibs party could break out among the guerrillas 
pressure has been increasing for policymakers from western 
countries to help mold the guerrillas into a more responsible 
coherent group but observers in kabul doubt it will happen 
outside interference in afghanistan has historically been a 
disaster both for the afghans and for the outside powers the 
russians ignored this reality said one un official speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
afghanistan was one of the worlds poorest countries before civil 
war erupted 10 years ago relief officials say it will take years 
and billions of dollars just to restore it to its prewar state 
they estimate they will need 16 billion for the first 18 months 
the country has the worlds lowest average life expectancy 42 
years and the highest child mortality rate 30 percent of all 
children die before the age of 5 according to unicef 
late last year a un convoy carrying wheat seeds and fertilizer 
took off from kabul for the guerrillacontrolled panjsher valley 
where thousands of farmers hoped to begin planting for the first 
time in 10 years 
it was the first such international effort and was a major test 
of whether the country was stable enough to begin rehabilitation 
work 
several hours outside kabul the convoy was hijacked by a rival 
guerrilla group several un staff members were taken hostage 
afghan and soviet troops responded with tanks artillery and air 
bombardments 
no was was injured and the workers were released after four 
days but any illusions relief workers might have had about a quick 
and easy end to the suffering were shattered 
we were anxious to do some real rehabilitation work said 
ross mountain deputy director of the un development program 
but we learned the hard way that there are many many different 
groups out there it looks like things will have to shake down some 
more he said

as national elections move closer 
the biggest bloc of voters remains undecided despite months of 
feverish campaigning by the main presidential contenders 
analysts say the undecided voters are mainly supporters of 
president raul alfonsins radical civil union angry at five years of 
economic stagnation and social unrest peronists unhappy with their 
partys candidate the centerright carlos menem and centerleft 
voters who feel none of the candidates speak for them 
i dont feel represented by any of them said virginia 
dardalla rute 33 the owner of a small public relations company 
none of them will make a good president 
real estate agent sandra reymann 25 voted for alfonsin in 1983 
but has been disappointed and would rather not vote for a radical in 
these elections set for may 14 but at the same time she would 
never vote peronist or socialist and doesnt think a conservative 
could win 
im not uninformed miss reymann said i read the papers i 
listen to the radio but no candidate stands out she said and 
the ballot she casts voting is mandatory in argentina may be 
blank 
at state in the elections are the presidency some senate seats 
half the house of deputies and provincial legislatures 
three surveys conducted over the past two months have put 
undecided voters at 39 percent 32 percent and 325 percent 
menem is 7 to 10 points ahead of the radicals eduardo angeloz in 
those polls and others but the gap has narrowed considerably 
alvaro alsogaray of the rightist democratic center union trails a 
distant third followed by nestor vicente of the united left 
under the constitution alfonsin cannot seek a second consecutive 
term 
menem and angeloz both provincial governors and lawyers have 
traversed the country and made the requisite swing through europe to 
demonstrate their statesmenship abilities 
positions have been staked out on how to restart the economy 
balance the budget curtail urban crime provide housing pay the 
foreign debt and ease relations between the military and human 
rights groups 
menem 53 and angeloz 57 are both centerright but their 
parties are movements that defy political labeling their parties 
along with the armed forces have provided argentinas presidents 
for most of this century 
menem has tried to play down the peronists black legend of 
violence and administrative incompetence which preceded military 
coups in 1955 and 1976 the latter has tried to distance himself 
from an unpopular government without losing the support of alfonsin 
a veteran campaigner and resources like access to state media 
now and again the two snipe at one another angelos says menems 
proposals are simplistic menem says angelos represents a 
government that fulfilled only 5 percent of what it promised 
but each for the moment seems more interested in polishing his 
own public image menem as the charismatic champion of organized 
labor and the downtrodden and angeloz as the honest administrator 
and family man than in demolishing the other 
i wont let you down is the slogan on menem posters which 
show the candidate with his hair to his shoulders and sideburns 
covering most of his cheeks 
it can be done is angelozs slogan he usually appears on 
posters and in person in a blue blazer and opennecked shirt 
wearing thickframed black glasses and a broad smile 
vicente a lawyer and several times a losing candidate for the 
house of deputies lacks a nationwide constituency and is little 
known outside the capital what he really is aiming to do is 
increase the number of leftist legislators in congress 
alsogaray for the same reasons has little chance of winning 
but the 75yearold military engineer and former economy minister 
and ambassador to the united states is a potential kingmaker 
in a scenario that frustrates menem and makes angeloz credible 
despite any poll no candidate will win enough votes to guarantee 
victory in the electoral college and the 600 electors pick a 
president or failing to do that pass the decision onto congress 
in either case the conservative alsogaray may trade his electors 
for political concessions and his party has much more in common 
with the radicals than the peronists 
in 1983 alsogaray supported alfonsin reluctantly to prevent a 
peronist victory 
angeloz and alsogaray insist their electors will vote for them 
more importantly both have rejected peronist suggestions that the 
runnersup support the candidate who gets the most votes 
maria julia alsogaray a national deputy and key adviser to her 
father in an interview published in the buenos aires herald 
acknowledged that in the end either in the electoral college or 
congress her party might provide the winning margin 
she set no specific concessions the party would demand but 
insisted that any candidate wishing to get our votes would have to 
adhere to the partys platform which calls for the privatization 
of state industries and minimal government among other things

next falls college freshmen face some of the 
worst tuition news in years 
the first trickle of announcements from public and private 
universities show tuitions and other fixed fees heading 715 percent 
higher the ninth consecutive year such charges will exceed the 
nations overall inflation rate 
tuitions at both public and private institutions had shot up in 
double digits from 1981 to 84 but had moderated somewhat in the 
last three years in 198889 they were up an average of 5 percent 
at publics and 9 percent at privates according to the college 
board 
but signs are that next fall will bring that moderating trend to 
a halt at many colleges and some students are already protesting 
 
one george washington university said freshman fees will rise 
by 201 percent or 2000 to 11500 while returning students 
will be hit with a smaller 10 percent increase 
by far the worst news is that higher education economists see no 
letup in the cost pressures that have been pushing tuitions up 
throughout the 1980s 
i see trends that have been going on for a decade that are not 
moderating the need for financial aid the rising cost of library 
acquisitions the need to improve salaries said richard rosser 
president of the national association of independent colleges and 
universities in washington 
kent halstead an expert on college finance and director of 
research associates of washington calculates that faculty salaries 
which averaged 37000 in 1988 are still 4000 below 1973 levels 
in terms of purchasing power allowing for inflation he figures 
that even with the huge tuition increases marking most of the 1980s 
faculty salaries have still only recouped half the losses suffered 
due to the inflationary 70s 
catchup is still the rule with faculty salaries said 
halstead 
library costs have likewise soared this past year according to 
several college officials who blame the weak us dollar for 
increasing the cost of acquiring foreignprinted books and research 
journals 
at george washington library acquisition costs rose 3050 
percent last year said robert a chernak vice president for 
student and academic support services such costs along with a 6 
percent rise in faculty salaries were key factors behind the 2 
million operating deficit that led to next falls mammoth tuition 
increase 
princeton university projects a 15 million deficit and recently 
announced a higherthananticipated 69 percent tuition increase 
partly because of soaring library costs said spokeswoman jacquelyn 
savani 
savani added that the 1987 stock market crash had an apparent 
psychological impact on college donors turning them more cautious 
even though the market has since made up the ground it lost changes 
in federal tax law making charitable giving less advantageous have 
put a further damper on college fundraising and are adding to the 
upward pressure on tuitions she said 
one has to scale back ones assumptions about the kind of 
income you can get from fundraising campaigns she said 
among other private institutions rates will rise 125 percent at 
syracuse university 75 percent each at brown university and 
stanford university 83 percent at lehigh university and 85 
percent at lafayette college 
several other schools besides george washington are starting 
twotier tuition systems of whopping increases for freshmen and 
lesser ones for returning students seton hall university will 
charge freshmen 196 percent more next fall while upperclass 
tuition will go up 108 percent 
johns hopkins university citing a projected 36 million deficit 
in its school of arts and sciences set increases of 166 percent 
for freshmen and 83 percent for returning students duke university 
and the university of chicago have established similar twotiered 
structures 
financial aid costs have also soared at private institutions at 
cornell university which will announce a roughly 7 percent tuition 
increase later this month aid costs will reach 178 million next 
fall compared with just 51 million in 1981 according to 
spokesman sam segal 
overall the nations private colleges are spending 35 billion 
on financial aid compared with 900 million in 1979 a fact rosser 
blamed on cuts in federal aid programs 
the first signs arent much better in the public sector which is 
generally slower in announcing its fall tuitions 
during the last three years public universities had moderated 
their average tuition hikes to 56 percent compared with increases 
that reached a high of 20 percent in 19823 but higher education 
officials note growing sentiment in many states especially those 
with budgetary problems to boost students share of the cost of 
public college 
public universities are now such a tremendous deal said 
halstead there is a genuine shift in philosophy in many states 
that there ought to be more of a user tax to support public 
education 
on average tuition and fees cover just 2533 percent of the cost 
of an education at public universities compared to about 80 percent 
at private schools said robert aaron a spokesman for the national 
association of state universities and land grant colleges 
it is fair to say that states in fiscal stress are looking for 
ways to diminish their higher education burden and are looking for 
students and parents to pay a larger share aaron said 
texas public colleges are raising tuitions for residents by 125 
percent and students have protested an oklahoma state regents 
proposal which still awaits legislative approval to raise freshmen 
tuition at the university of oklahoma and oklahoma state university 
by 197 percent 
new jersey state colleges will charge students about 7 percent 
more next fall about 150200 per student according to darryl 
greer executive director of the states college governing boards 
association 
former us secretary of education william j bennett used to 
mince no words in regularly lambasting higher education for raising 
tuitions while doing little to curb what he considered waste and 
mismanagement 
by contrast the current education secretary former texas tech 
university president lauro f cavazos pulled his punches in a 
statement released by his office 
most certainly the projected rise in college tuition costs is 
a concern to me he said acknowledging the challenge for college 
administrators in meeting rising costs while at the same time 
keeping tuition within potential students reach 
at the university of oklahoma about 40 students chained 
themselves in protest to the administration building last november 
when tuition plans were announced 
theres a chance that we may be locked out of an education 
said protest organizer jp blackwood a senior from bartlesville 
it tuition is on the verge of having doubled since ive been 
here

major us airlines bracing for the twin threats 
of a strike against eastern airlines and a disruption of 
transportation nationwide are making two kinds of contingency plans 
several of easterns competitors said wednesday they are 
assembling plans to respond to a possible walkout saturday by the 
machinists union which could send passengers booked on eastern 
scurrying to other airlines eastern carries an average of 100000 
passengers a day 
in addition some carriers are mapping strategy to keep operating 
in the event of a secondary boycott by the machinists who have 
threatened to picket other airlines over the eastern dispute 
to absorb the passenger spillover from a strike against 
miamibased eastern some competitors plan to roll out extra 
sections an extra plane for existing flights 
pan am corp for example plans to operate a double shuttle 
on its service linking new york with boston and washington if a 
strike occurs pan am and eastern compete fiercely with their 
profitable hourly shuttle services 
starting monday morning during peak travel hours the pan am 
shuttle would have flights every halfhour instead of the current 
hourly takeoffs said pan am spokeswoman pamela hanlon at 
prime peak hours even more flights could be added as needed 
she said 
pan am which also vies with eastern in the lucrative florida 
market also plans to put extra sections on some flights and switch 
to larger aircraft on others 
airlines admit though that its difficult to actually add new 
flights to their schedules in a pinch 
we dont have a lot of extra aircraft sitting on the ground 
that we can throw into the schedule said delta air lines

bargain hunters loyalists and skeptics alike were among the 
shoppers who jammed sears stores nationwide to get their first taste 
of the retailers everyday low pricing policy 
the customers are filling their shopping bags said dick 
warner a sears roebuck and co regional merchandise manager who 
was at a store in traverse city mich on wednesday the store 
managers have indicated the traffic they had was better than 
christmas traffic 
the nations largest retailer has switched to more namebrand 
merchandise and discount prices to lure shoppers away from cutrate 
competitors like k mart and walmart which have grown rapidly 
the 103yearold chicagobased sears closed its 824 stores for 42 
hours monday through midday wednesday to slap new prices on the 
50000 items of merchandise 
eva mae dyer of forest park ga wasnt sure how significant the 
price changes were but she said her shopping patterns probably 
wouldnt change 
i really care a lot for sears she said weve been trading 
with them for 41 years and i expect to keep shopping here even if 
the prices arent cut that much 
some politicians joined in celebrations minnesota lt gov 
marlene johnson called sears a good corporate citizen as she 
helped greet 500 shoppers at a store in st paul in peoria ill 
mayor jim maloof took part in a ribboncutting and told about 100 
people who waited in the cold that sears hung in with peoria 
through the bad times earlier this decade 
we have shopped at sears for 57 years said bruce boswell of 
east peoria if they come down on their prices theyll get all 
their old customers back 
some people thought the quality of merchandise would go down 
along with the price 
i think it might cheapen them a little bit but theyre a grade 
higher than k mart said pam cage 31 one of about 3000 shoppers 
who crowded a sears store in miami 
barbara palazzolo spokeswoman for the 2265store k mart corp 
based in troy mich said the nations no 2 retailer planned no 
immediate response to the sears move weve had everyday low 
prices for the past 27 years she said 
prices under the new sears policy may vary among the retailers 
24 regions but sears officials were convinced they will win 
approval from customers 
sears switch to more uniform pricing a strategy pioneered by 
discount chains and adapted successfully last year by montgomery 
ward amp co makes sears comparable to the discounters in price but 
not in looks most goods are still shown in decorative displays 
making sears stores resemble a department store rather than a 
strippeddown discount operation 
a spot check at chicago outlets of sears k mart montgomery ward 
and toys r us and a jc penney co store in schaumburg ill 
found sears with the lowest prices on many items wednesday 
a 48pack of huggies diapers costs 969 at sears 989 at toys 
r us and 1157 at k mart a pair of mens levis 505 blue jeans 
cost 1796 at sears 1999 at k mart and 2299 at jc penney a 
3pack of mens fruit of the loom underwear cost 449 at montgomery 
ward 496 at sears and 899 at k mart 
the strategy marks a departure from the traditional retailing 
technique of hyping goods with periodic sales sears said it will 
still have sales but less than in the past 
not all customers were pleased 
prices seem to be a little lower but i dont see a heck of a 
lot of difference said one woman at the holyoke mass sears who 
declined to give her name but described herself as a regular sears 
shopper 
lynn carver of barkhamsted conn said she drove to a west 
hartford sears store to exchange some sheets and found the price was 
about 20 percent higher than the week before 
operating manager larry glowa said the sheets had been on sale 
last week and were not among the items reduced in price wednesday

defense lawyers have packed a federal courtroom 
looking for signs of the future in the gaf corp stock manipulation 
case the first jury trial to develop indirectly from the 
confessions of insider trader ivan boesky 
they say that conflicting testimony a discredited witness and 
stocktrading complexity has cast doubt on a case which is seen as 
a test of the governments ability to convince juries of wall street 
crimes 
this is a government stretch said gerald lefcourt a 
prominent securities fraud defense attorney its a case that 
probably wouldnt have been brought a few years ago 
so far few signs of government strength in the case have 
emerged a mistrial was declared in january after a prosecutor 
withheld evidence albeit unintentionally the defense has 
challenged the integrity of the star witness testimony hasnt 
exactly captivated jurors who often appear confused or bored 
gaf and its vice chairman james sherwin are charged with 
illegally trying to manipulate the stock of union carbide corp in 
october 1986 to maximize profits from the planned sale of a large 
block of shares the indictment also charges securities fraud 
conspiracy and wire fraud 
the government closed its case tuesday with a witness 
contradicting testimony of brokerage firm founder boyd l jefferies 
an admitted felon who is the governments main source of evidence 
he is expected to testify in other fraud trials as part of a plea 
deal with the government 
it clearly cannot help the governments case that its two major 
witnesses are testifying inconsistently on what appear to be 
important points said robert morvillo another securities fraud 
defense attorney 
the gaf trial is one of the few criminal stock manipulation cases 
to reach a jury involving a company traded on the new york stock 
exchange the last was the trial of edward gilbert convicted in 
1981 he was known as the boy wonder of wall street before 
running into trouble in the early 1960s 
earlier manipulation cases prevalent during boom market years in 
the 1960s typically involved lightly traded stock of small 
companies it is far more difficult to alter the price of a stock 
that trades in large volume 
the gaf case is thorny lawyers said because it involves just a 
few days of trading in union carbide rather than a longterm pattern 
of manipulation also the stock price was only marginally affected 
in the alleged deal and the accused didnt profit 
lefcourt said he believes criminal charges in such a case would 
be logical if somebody is trying to manipulate a stock and makes a 
fortune and clearly is doing something to hurt the public investor 
you dont see that here 
the prosecution also must show that the defendants conspired to 
intentionally manipulate the stock the combined factors have made 
some lawyers wonder why the government made gaf its test case 
the difficult part of this one is youve got one trade and a 
swearing match between the different interested parties on what the 
purpose was said peter romatowski a former head of the 
securities fraud section in the manhattan us attorneys office 
the purpose is everything what was in the peoples minds when 
the trade was conducted said romatowski now a private attorney 
after the defense moved for dismissal tuesday us district 
judge mary johnson lowe said the case posed the problem of 
distinguishing between a manipulative trade and one that 
legitimately causes a stock price change but she refused to throw 
it out 
the gaf case also is important because it tests information 
supplied by boesky the former arbitrager who paid the government 
100 million to settle insider trading charges in late 1986 
boesky fingered among others jefferies who agreed to plead 
guilty to two securities law violations quit his los angeles firm 
and testify against other alleged criminals his testimony is 
considered critical to separate cases against speculator salim b 
lewis and takeover investor paul bilzerian 
the gaf defense led by attorney arthur liman widely known from 
the 1987 irancontra hearings has sought to paint jefferies as a 
felon whose word cant be trusted james melton chief broker at 
jefferies amp co contradicted jefferies on several key points 
including whether sherwin ordered stock manipulation 
some lawyers in boeskyderived cases claim the government is 
abusing its discretion by bringing criminal charges instead of civil 
ones 
i think youve got a new set of rules by virtue of the deals 
the government has made with boesky jefferies and investment 
banker martin siegel and the government needs to justify those 
deals morvillo said

less than 30 percent of taxpayers have filed 
their returns halfway into the filing season but the pace is still 
ahead of last years 
the internal revenue service said wednesday that through feb 24 
it had received 308 million returns up 2 percent over the 
comparable period of 1988 when 302 million were received 
the number of taxpayers filing the long form 1040 most of whom 
itemize deductions dropped 42 percent the irs said but the 
number filing the short form 1040a and the onepage 1040ez rose 
75 percent and 68 percent this years figures include 131 
million long forms 85 million form 1040a and 91 million form 
1040ez 
the irs read the figures as suggesting that many taxpayers who 
filed form 1040 in the past may be switching to the simpler shorter 
forms 
the reason is that the 1986 tax overhaul raised the standard 
deductions and took away or reduced several important deductions 
making it no longer profitable for these taxpayers to itemize 
deductions for twoearner couples and for state sales taxes were 
wiped out by the new law which watered down the deductions for 
consumer interest and for medical expenses the law eliminated the 
individual retirement account deduction for millions of taxpayers 
and reduced it for many others 
at this time last year 454 percent of returns were on the long 
form this year the long form accounts for 42 percent 
however those taxpayers with simpler tax situations normally 
file earlier in the season while those with more complicated 
returns procrastinate it is not clear whether a longrange result 
of the 1986 tax changes will be to sharply reduce the number filing 
long forms 
through last weekend the irs had processed almost half the 
returns it had received and and had approved refund checks for 
almost 83 million taxpayers up 9 percent from last year the 
refunds totaled 68 billion an increase of almost 14 percent and 
averaged 825 up from 793 at this time last year 
taxpayers are expected to file 109 million individual returns 
this year up from 107 million last year the filing deadline is 
april 17 
despite widespread publicity about the irss giving wrong replies 
onethird of the time the agency had received 143 million calls to 
its tollfree answer line through last week still that is down 
from 157 million for the comparable period a year ago 
the agency reported a big increase in the number of taxpayers 
using the tollfree teletax system the system recorded 54 
million calls through last week up from 2 million a year ago 
teletax offers taperecorded generalized advice on more than 140 
tax topics telephone numbers to reach the system are printed in the 
tax packages mailed to most taxpayers by the irs

residents of the northeast and midwest are more 
confident of their drinking waters quality than southerners and 
westerners a survey shows 
seventy percent of northeastern residents and 71 percent of 
midwestern residents felt their drinking water was free of harmful 
contamination according to a survey released wednesday by the water 
quality association 
sixtyone percent of southerners and 66 percent of westerners 
felt that way the survey showed 
maribeth robb the associations director of communications said 
one reason for less concern over drinking water in the northeast and 
midwest may be because of an abundance of water in those areas 
we would probably tend to think less about conservation and 
water problems she said 
the group based in lisle ill said 1000 people were polled in 
the random telephone survey conducted by an independent research 
firm in late january and early february ms robb said she did not 
know the margin of error 
nationally 79 percent of those questioned thought drinking water 
in their homes was acceptable and 20 percent said it was 
unacceptable one percent said they didnt know 
eightyseven percent of those questioned said taste was the key 
factor in the way they judge water quality appearance and odor also 
counted heavily 
the survey also indicated most americans want more personal 
control over the water quality in their homes 
of those questioned 51 percent said they had little or no 
control over the quality and more than 90 percent said they want to 
have more control 
although the survey indicated most people are confident about the 
quality of their home drinking water 61 percent said they would 
feel more confident if they had a water treatment system 
the trade association provides research educational support and 
representation to more than 2400 manufacturers and dealers of water 
quality improvement technology 
the survey was released at the opening of an association 
convention in atlanta

of the west german banks meeting later thursday he said 
securities and currency markets have been cautious watching to 
see whether west german banks would raise interest rates following 
the us discount rate hike last week the us federal reserve 
board raised its discount rate its charge for loans to private 
banks from 65 percent to 70 percent 
trading was moderate with first section volume estimated at 800

the dollar now has gained 207 yen in the last three days 
the us currencys higher opening in tokyo followed its upward 
trend on overseas markets overnight dealers said 
japanese investors were more interested in buying the west german 
mark because of speculation that west german banks might raise their 
interest rates said a dealer with the bank of tokyo speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
if west germany does not raise rates the dollar will probably 
rise because those who were reluctant to hold many dollars today 
will go back to the us money he added

massachusetts residents were allegedly bilked out 
of 100000 by an arizona company promoting a billion dollar 
sunplex amusement park that never saw as much as a building 
permit 
the state securities division filed an administrative complaint 
wednesday against international diversified investment corp of 
arizona and two of its principals james and denise tiberio for 
selling unregistered stocks and investments to people in 
massachusetts 
in 1985 the tiberios contacted about a dozen massachusetts 
residents through a mutual friend and sought investments for the 
sunplex a proposed amusement park secretary of state michael 
connolly said 
the complex was proposed for eloy ariz but the tiberios never 
got so much as a building permit officials said 
the investment company and the tiberios also are under 
investigation by securities officials in arizona 
the case took years to get under way because the couple had 
disappeared for an extended period after living lavishly in a 
mansion with a rolls royce and guard dogs in phoenix they now live 
in a residence without a telephone in fountain hills ariz 
according to pamela merchant an enforcement attorney with the 
massachusetts securities division 
investors in the amusement park were promised profits as big as 
the proposed park for every dollar invested the tiberios allegedly 
promised investors would receive 50 in profit 
the couple estimated that one of three tourists visiting arizona 
would come to the park enabling it to turn a billion dollar profit 
within three years 
they flew these people down to arizona to wine them and dine 
them merchant said apparently it was very fancy wining and 
dining 
investors who lose in such scams have a chance of getting some of 
their money back but in this case its a slim chance she said 
they dont seem to have any money so its unlikely merchant 
said 
among other things the amusement park was to boast the worlds 
largest sun dial which the tiberios promised would land sunplex in 
the guinness book of world records 
it also was to have a bullet train called the sun streak 
linking the desert park to california and nevada visitors would 
stay in airconditioned comfort at a palace of the sun hotel 
according to merchant the tiberios had no particular occupation 
before getting involved with the investment deal after gathering 
possibly as much as a half million dollars from investors in 
massachusetts arizona and texas merchant said the tiberios 
traveled to europe in january 1986 where an associate promised to 
invest the money in foreign currencies 
the investor promptly lost the tiberios money merchant said 
when the couple called some of their investors and asked for more 
money at least one massachusetts investor came up with 30000 
merchant said

while the heated advertising war between diet coke 
and diet pepsi is being fought with celebrities such as madonna 
michael jackson and don johnson massachusetts regulators say the 
companies claims last summer to win consumer taste tests were made 
without substantiation 
in the ads last summer pepsi said it was undisputed champion 
and decisively beat diet coke in taste tests while diet coke 
said it was winner and still champion after beating pepsi four 
times in four years 
paula w gold state secretary of consumer affairs and business 
regulation said wednesday that both companies tests were skewed by 
improper sampling techniques and did not fairly represent a random 
sample of cities across the nation 
coke and pepsi have been competing intensely for the lucrative 
diet soft drink market which is growing at an annual rate of 84 
percent more than twice as fast as sales of soda as a whole 
during 1988 diet coke had 82 percent of the 43 billion soft 
drink market while diet pepsi had 52 percent according to jesse 
meyers publisher of beverage digest in greenwich conn 
gold an aggressive regulator who has previously ordered 
investigations into auto salesmen and bank fees said she decided to 
check on coke and pepsi because of the obvious contradiction between 
their highprofile ads both companies discontinued the ads at the 
end of the summer 
although cocacola is based in atlanta and pepsis headquarters 
are in purchase ny gold said they have operations in 
massachusetts and their advertising has an effect here 
i think if suspect advertising practices are allowed to go 
unchecked then advertisers come down to the lowest common 
denominator she said youve got to look at and enforce the big 
players as well as the little ones 
spokesmen for both coke and pepsi disputed the massachusetts 
regulators findings 
this type of test has been upheld in the past by the courts 
certainly by the television networks and also by the national 
advertisers bureau said tod mackenzie a spokesman at pepsis 
headquarters this quite frankly seems to be a case in which the 
state has stepped into an area thats new to it and i think that 
shows in their report 
gold said she requested detailed information from the soft drink 
companies in july and gave it to an independent evaluator frederick 
wiseman a professor of marketing and statistics at northeastern 
university in boston 
wiseman said wednesday that coke gave taste tests to 999 people 
in 10 eastern cities pepsis test sample was 1000 people in four 
cities seattle los angeles philadelphia and indianapolis 
taste test research does not have to be as exact as a political 
poll where youre really aiming for a national projection 
wiseman said 
but this is a case where the samples were just too far off you 
had coke basically ignoring one half of the country and pepsi 
picking just four cities all within 100 miles of a processing 
plant 
wiseman said he found no evidence that either company 
deliberately rigged its samples to achieve a certain result rather 
he said it appears they were just trying to get it done quickly 
gold said that after the ads had aired coke expanded its sample 
to 27 cities across the country if coke had done the broader 
testing before the ads ran she said it would have been adequate 
substantiation 
but doing it after the fact still doesnt make it right she 
said

share prices were slightly higher on londons stock 
exchange at midday thursday after trading in a narrow range 
throughout the morning on continuing nervousness about future rises 
in british and world interest rates 
the west german bundesbank left its key rates unchanged after its 
fortnightly council meeting thursday easing earlier fears that 
british rates would have to rise simply to keep pace with a west 
german rate hike 
but more signs of sterling weakness and the generally pessimistic 
analysis of wednesdays british trade figures combined to create 
some nervousness about the longterm outlook for british interest 
rates 
players were still considering the conflicting signals on the 
likely trend in british rates dealers said institutional investors 
are likely to remain on the sidelines until the picture becomes 
clear they added 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index was up 1 
point or 005 percent at 20223 at about 115 pm about halfway

the us environmental protection agency 
has filed a lawsuit against the g heileman brewing co for 
allegedly polluting sewers in this southern illinois city for nine 
years 
the lawsuit accused heilemans stag brewery plant of repeatedly 
discharging wastes without adequate treatment into bellevilles 
wastewater treatment system 
the lawsuit filed feb 9 in us district court in alton 
charges that the brewery repeatedly discharged wastes containing 
high concentrations of biochemical oxygen demand and total suspended 
solids 
the wisconsinbased company faces up to 37 million in fines if 
found guilty said anne weinert an epa environmental engineer 
heileman officials could not be reached for comment 
the epa filed a lawsuit nov 22 in federal court alleging 
belleville had violated pollution discharge limits since april 1985 
epa and city officials have been negotiating a fine but have not 
reached a settlement 
ms weinert said wednesday the agency now believes pollutants 
discharged from the brewery are what caused the city to violate the 
federal clean water act 
we believe that stag brewery is one of the major reasons for 
the citys violations ms weinert said 
mayor richard brauer said he believed the lawsuit against the 
brewery could cause the epa to lower the citys fine which could 
have been as much as 125000 
this would be part of our negotiations brauer said 
since stag closed last august the city has been in compliance 
with the clean water act brauer said 
from the time stag began operating in 1979 city officials worked 
to help the brewery comply with epa regulations brauer said 
we were aware of the problem and we were working with the 
brewery he said we proposed a couple of plans to the illinois 
epa and one was accepted but by the time iepa accepted the plan 
heileman decided not to go through with it 
the city offered to build a 29 million pretreatment plant for 
the brewery which would have brought it into compliance with epa 
regulations brauer said heileman would have had to repay the city 
heileman rejected the offer and decided to close the brewery 
instead the plant officially closed its doors in august causing 
the loss of about 230 jobs 
despite the sewage problems and lawsuits brauer said he would 
prefer to see the brewery open again 
brewery officials have said the only thing that could keep the 
stag brewery open was to sell 10 million more barrels of beer each 
year the brewery which had the capacity to brew 253 million 
barrels each year shipped only 1625 million barrels in 1987

a national labor relations board complaint against 
meatpacker john morrell amp co recommends reinstatement and back pay 
for workers at plants which were closed then reopened with lower 
wage scales a union says 
the nlrb office here issued a complaint wednesday saying morrell 
fraudulently concealed an unlawful scheme to circumvent its 
master agreement with the union the united food amp commercial 
workers said 
the union said the nlrb complaint also cites discrimination 
against workers because of their union activities 
back pay and job reinstatement for affected employees from the 
plants in kansas and tennessee are among the sweeping and 
breathtaking recommendations of the nlrb complaint said phillip 
l immesote director of the unions 85000member packinghouse 
division 
the union said the company could be responsible for 100 million 
or more in back pay 
officials of the union in washington and the nlrb office in 
chicago were not available late wednesday 
in june 1982 morrell closed the former rodeo meats inc plant in 
arkansas city kan where nearly 750 ufcw members worked at a base 
wage of 1107 an hour the union said 
the plant reopened in march 1983 under the name ark city packing 
co with 200 workers paid 5 an hour the union said the plant now 
employs more than 500 workers represented by local 340 of the 
union at a base rate of 760 an hour according to the union 
morrell also closed a plant in memphis tenn in july 1982 
which had employed about 400 members of the unions local 242 at a 
base wage of 1069 an hour according to the union 
when the plant reopened under the name memphis packing co in 
september 1983 it employed 250 workers at a base wage of 550 an 
hour when it closed again in june 1986 it employed 300 workers at 
a base wage of 850 an hour the ufcw said the plant has not 
reopened 
the nlrb says a majority of the rehired workers were former 
employees but the company refused to rehire certain workers because 
of their union activities the union said 
david parker an nlrb spokesman in washington was not familiar 
with details of the morrell case but said such complaints are often 
a first step in cases that can be appealed to an administrative law 
judge the fivemember nlrb or federal courts 
a message left with an operator at morrells cincinnati 
headquarters after business hours wednesday was not immediately 
returned 
this process can take a long time unless the parties reach a 
settlement parker said it can take several years 
the union claims to have a company document which spells out 
strategy to break the master agreement and the union 
if the company a subsidiary of united brands co does not fight 
the complaint it must reinstate all employees laid off in 1982 at 
the arkansas city and memphis plants or find them substantially 
equivalent positions the union said

president bush still is weighing whether to 
step in and avert an impending strike against eastern airlines the 
white house said today 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater suggested the 
decision may not come before friday when bush plans to meet with 
top advisers on the situation 
the international association of machinists is set to strike 
eastern at 1201 am est saturday 
a federal judge was considering a motion today to allow the 
machinists union to picket five other major airlines northwest 
usair united piedmont and trans world in the event of a strike 
the union also has said it plans pickets at rail sea and other 
transportation companies along with sister airline continental and 
texas air corp parent firm of eastern and continental 
federal mediators have urged bush to stop the strike which the 
machinists say could disrupt air rail and sea transportation 
nationwide 
civil rights leader jesse jackson and labor leaders have also 
urged the president to use his presidential powers to declare a 
national transportation emergency postponing any strike for 60 days 
while a special panel investigates 
jackson who ran for the democratic presidential nomination last 
year met with bush at the white house on wednesday night 
presumably to discuss the eastern situation however fitzwater said 
he did not know what the two discussed in the private session 
as to stopping the strike for 60 days no decision has been 
made fitzwater said today 
earlier he said bush would make his decision on whether to step 
in before the midnight friday deadline which marks the end of a 
30day coolingoff period after failure of the national mediation 
boards yearlong efforts to resolve the dispute 
eastern which says it is losing about 1 million a day wants to 
cut salaries to save 150 million the international association of 
machinists and aerospace workers which represents 8500 eastern 
baggage handlers and other ground services workers wants 50 
million in salary increases 
eastern opposes presidential intervention which would also delay 
for 60 days the airlines power to make salary cuts the union wants 
bush to act 
the recommendation last week from the twomember board that bush 
call an emergency panel had been received by the white house but 
the president had not yet gotten the benefit of a staff 
recommendation spokesman stephen hart said wednesday 
bush was in asia when the board which mediates labor disputes 
involving railways and airlines proposed presidential action 
the mediation board has the power to call for a presidential 
emergency panel when it believes a sector of the country could be 
or is being deprived of essential transportation services 
under the law bush would appoint three members to the panel to 
examine the matter and make a report within 30 days 
the board has made several requests for emergency panels in 
railway labor disputes in recent years but none involving an airline 
since one that averted a threatened pan american world airways 
strike in 1966 congress ordered a special panel in a weinalaskan 
air dispute in 1978 however 
joseph guerrieri union attorney filed the motion in federal 
court wednesday to get a ruling allowing the union to picket other 
airlines with which it has contracts 
the airlines argue that no strike language in their contracts 
forbids such action the union said guerrieri maintains that a 
1987 supreme court ruling allowing secondary picketing under the 
railway labor act precludes the nostrike provision 
aflcio leaders have vowed to do everything legally possible to 
help the union ground eastern continental and texas air in the 
event of a strike 
easterns pilots have said they would decide after a strike is 
called whether to cross picket lines texas air chairman frank 
lorenzo made a personal appeal to the pilots wednesday to sign a new 
contract and continue working the pilots have separate negotiations 
with the airline 
eastern says it cannot afford further delay before cutting costs 
the union accuses the airline of planning to transfer its 
operations to nonunion continental texas air is awaiting final 
government approval to sell off easterns moneymaking east coast 
shuttle operations to new york real estate magnate donald trump

a judge has approved a 299 million settlement of 
27 lawsuits tied to a 1984 oil refinery explosion that killed 17 
people and injured 10 others 
unocal oil co owner of the romeoville refinery south of 
chicago and nine other companies were sued for negligence by the 
families of those killed and injured in the explosion attorney 
bruce r pfaff said 
pfaff who represents six plaintiffs said the case was about two 
years from trial prompting all sides to reach an agreement 
cook county judge donald p oconnell on wednesday approved the 
settlement after months of pretrial conferences and negotiations 
that at one time involved more than 50 law firms representing the 
plaintiffs unocal and other companies 
lloyd williams who represented unocal and the other companies in 
negotiations said the companies individual contributions to the 
settlement were confidential 
the explosion occurred july 23 1984 in a 55foot vessel 
containing liquid hydrocarbons byproducts of the refining process 
pfaff said 
an investigation later determined that the vessel exploded when 
internal cracks in the inchthick steel broke through the outer 
skin pfaff said 
the lawsuits against unocal and companies involved in the 
vessels design construction and maintenance contended that unocal 
inspectors failed to properly test the vessels walls for stress 
the lawsuits also said repairs made to the vessel by welders made it 
too brittle to withstand inside pressure 
pfaff said the settlement did not require unocal or the other 
companies to admit fault 
after about 100 million in repairs the refinery reopened 16 
months after the explosion

workers at jaguar plc the british luxury car 
maker narrowly rejected the companys final pay offer and have 
scheduled an overtime ban starting this weekend and weekly oneday 
strikes after monday 
the final tally showed 3700 workers rejecting the offer and 
3682 accepting it a jaguar spokesman who wasnt identified in 
accordance with british custom said thursday 
the result was decided by the votes cast late wednesday by 800 
nightshift workers 
the spokesman said jaguar would appeal the outcome which was 
based on votes cast at open meetings and would ask the union to 
stage a secret ballot 
those voting against the contract offer represented only 42 
percent of eligible voters and the company hopes a secret vote 
would increase the voter turnout 
we would like a secret ballot to sort this out the jaguar 
spokesman said this vote is not a sufficient mandate for damaging 
industrial action 
in negotiations last weekend jaguar made what it said was its 
final offer a twoyear deal including raises of 47 percent in the 
first year and 44 percent in the second plus bonuses 
jaguar said its workers earn an average 210 pounds or the 
equivalent of 361 per week

a threatened strike by eastern airlines machinists 
this weekend has sent travelers scrambling for other carriers and 
eastern warned a sympathy walkout by pilots could bury the company 
in the corporate graveyard 
ticket agents reported a surge in sales at eastern competitors as 
a strike appeared increasingly likely at the miamibased airline 
which carries an average of 100000 passengers a day and says it is 
losing 1 million daily 
eastern wants to cut salaries to save 150 million the 
machinists union representing 8500 eastern baggage handlers and 
other ground services workers wants 50 million in salary increases 
company chairman frank lorenzo in a videotape sent wednesday to 
the pilots union warned that if the pilots and other employees 
support the machinists picket line and dont show up for work 
eastern cannot survive 
im afraid eastern is going to go through this juncture and 
perhaps end up in the corporate graveyard said lorenzo the 
chairman of texas air easterns parent company 
easterns rivals also have been mapping strategy to keep 
operating in the event of a secondary boycott by the machinists 
union which has asked a federal court judge in washington to allow 
its members to picket other airlines ships and other modes of 
transportation 
while most airlines arent commenting on contingency plans in the 
event of an industrywide strike some of easterns fiercest 
competitors are moving to cash in on the passenger spillover 
pan american corp which vies with eastern in the lucrative east 
coast shuttle routes already has said it would double its flights 
linking new york to boston and washington during a strike 
and delta said it can handle easterns surplus to florida and 
puerto rico without putting more planes in the air 
nonunion continental airlines also owned by texas air has 
downplayed the effect of a strike at eastern despite vows by 
machinists union members to close it down as well 
we are two totally separate carriers said continental 
spokesman ned walker in houston we do not expect any impact at 
continental from the eastern situation there will be no service 
disruption whatsoever 
eastern says it is doomed unless its pilots continue flying 
during a strike set to begin at 1201 am est saturday unless an 
agreement is reached in the machinists 17monthold contract 
dispute 
lorenzos videotaped message offered pilots sweeter pay raises 
and job security but leaders of the pilots and flight attendants 
unions have urged members to honor picket lines 
lorenzo who bought eastern in 1986 earned a unionbusting 
reputation when he broke labor contracts with continentals workers 
after taking that airline into bankruptcy reorganization in 1983 
the 3500member pilots union said the new offer does not 
guarantee job security contains 64 million in pilot concessions 
and would require the union to drop lawsuits and grievances worth 
250 million 
in his videotape mr lorenzo made a fine theatrical 
performance the pilots executive council said in a statement to 
its members dont be misled much work still needs to be done 
the machinists also appealed for solidarity in the days before 
the strike 
we would hope the pilots would remember that lorenzo has made 
agreements before and contracts mean nothing to him hes not to be 
trusted said frank ortis vice president of the machinists miami 
local 
the white house meanwhile is giving no hint of whether 
president bush will meet the request of federal mediators and stop a 
strike white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush will 
make his decision on whether to step in before the midnight friday 
deadline 
as to a proposal to stop the strike for 60 days no decision 
has been made fitzwater said today 
eastern ran fullpage advertisements in some newspapers today 
quoting editorials across the country that urge bush not to call in 
federal mediators 
eastern has promised passengers full refunds or seats on other 
airlines at no extra cost if flights are canceled but several 
competitors remain wary of accepting tickets a bankrupt eastern 
might not be able to pay for

grain and soybean futures prices turned mixed 
after opening slightly lower today on the chicago board of trade 
possibly indicating the markets attention was turning from weather 
concerns to export activity 
the opening decline extended the sharp selloff that ended 
wednesdays session analysts said the selling was prompted in part 
by reports of beneficial rain in the soybean fields of argentina 
the worlds thirdlargest soybean producer 
but the selling eased shortly after the opening on reports of 
higher cash prices for soybeans and talk of soviet interest in 
purchasing us corn 
export activity has been on the rise lately with the agriculture 
department targeting both china and iraq for large sales of us 
wheat at subsidized prices 
the wave of early buying may also reflect attitudes that 
wednesdays sharp decline in soybean prices was unwarranted 
in early trading wheat was 1 cents to 1 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in march at 437 a bushel corn was 
unchanged to cent lower with march at 271 a bushel oats were 
unchanged to 1 cents higher with march at 204 a bushel soybeans 
were 1 cent lower to 1 cent higher with march at 750 a bushel

company in an effort to block the planned sale of its footwear 
division to an investor group for 4225 million 
the shareholders filed the lawsuit wednesday in hamilton county 
common pleas court alleging us shoe chairman philip barach and the 
companys directors breached their fiduciary duty to shareholders by 
agreeing to sell the division

to increase the companys value for its shareholders 
a us shoe representative declined comment on the suit 
us shoe announced this week it was selling its footwear unit to 
a group led by merrill lynch capital partners 
the planned sale stemmed from a sixmonth search by another

clothing stores such as casual corner and the lenscrafters optical 
stores 
wall street had expected the entire company to be sold and was 
disappointed in the announcement some analysts had predicted sale 
of us shoes individual businesses could be worth more than 30 a 
share

shareholders filing the suit it accuses us shoe directors of 
trying to perpetuate their control of the company rather than 
carrying out their duties to shareholders to get maximum value for 
the company

expecting the entire company to be sold 
wednesday the stock closed in new york stock exchange trading at 
1887 representing a paper loss of 1250 in early trading

mayor federico pena says he will consider yet 
another referendum on denvers proposed 3 billion airport 
there are arguments pro and con and im trying to weigh those 
arguments he told the city council and chamber of commerce on 
wednesday 
the airport which would be the first such major project in the 
nation since the dallasfort worth airport opened in 1974 survived 
an election in may when adams county voters agreed to annexation of 
land outside denver for the project 
pena and others contend the airport scheduled for a july 
groundbreaking will ease a projected air transportation crush and 
boost colorados economy stapleton international airport is flawed 
in design and too small they say 
but opponents have called the project a waste of money engineered 
by fat cats and would rather see stapleton expanded city 
councilmen ted hackworth and bob crider are seeking to put an 
airport question on the ballot 
i just think weve got to make a decision pick a course were 
going to commit ourselves to and then just stick to it pena said 
wednesday 
on sunday the mayor had said a referendum isnt needed because 
the airport wont be financed with local tax dollars 
the city is asking for 500 million from the federal government 
with the rest of the money coming from revenue bonds the sale of 
land at stapleton and revenue from the old airport such as 
concessions fuel taxes and landing fees

a group of mcorp creditors including new york 
investment banker shearson lehman hutton inc has formed a 
committee and started work on its own restructuring plan for the 
troubled dallas holding company the dallas morning news reported 
today 
the newspaper cited sources as saying the committee has met with 
mcorp managers and federal regulators with a goal of submitting a 
plan to rescue the company 
the group also includes another investment firm based in new 
york kleinwort benson inc the newspaper said 
shearson confirmed wednesday the investment firm had joined with 
other mcorp creditors in an informal group 
shearson has much to lose if mcorp cannot successfully 
reorganize the investment firm holds 147 million of mcorp 
securities and suffered losses of more than 110 million in 1988 
from recognizing the plummeting value of those holdings 
any recovery of those losses likely depends on mcorps ability to 
emerge as a going concern the morning news said 
shearson is said to have also taken a leading role in helping to 
convince other mcorp creditors to not force the company which has 
skipped bond payments into bankruptcy 
a group holding bonds from national bancshares corp of san 
antonio has threatened to force the company into bankruptcy if it 
does not resume interest payments this week 
and the trustee for bondholders of texas american bancshares inc 
of fort worth has filed suit against that company also demanding 
overdue bond payments the federal suit was filed in december in 
fort worth by the bank of new york on behalf of bondholders texas 
american said wednesday 
texas american said it is contesting the suit charging that the 
bondholders want preferential treatment in the companys 
restructuring effort 
federal regulators continue to negotiate with minnesota banker 
carl pohlad who has tentatively agreed to buy both texas american 
and national bancshares 
meanwhile hope has faded that mcorp can win government approval 
for the companys own proposal to bail out its 25 subsidiary banks 
last fall mcorp chairman gene h bishop said the firm could raise 
400 million in new capital which it wanted to combine with federal 
deposit insurance corp assistance 
analysts have estimated mcorp would need at least 1 billion in 
government aid 
soon after bishops announcement last october shearson publicly 
supported the companys effort

jesse jackson blaming buccaneer bankers 
for the savings and loan crisis backed a liberal coalitions 
proposal thursday to require institutions to commit money for 
lowand moderateincome housing as a concession for an sampl bailout 
the plan also would include an increase in the top federal income 
tax rate and fees charged to financial institutions to pay for the 
multibilliondollar shoring up of the savings and loan industry 
we applaud president bush for addressing the crisis rather than 
simply ignoring it as his predecessor did jackson said but we 
believe his plan to bail out buccaneer bankers is not adequate 
jacksons rainbow coalition organization was one of about 100 
groups including unions citizens groups churches and political 
groups who are supporting an effort called the financial democracy 
campaign to promote an alternative to the administrations plan 
the coalitions plan would establish a national housing finance 
administration financed by banks savings and loans and other 
financial institutions providing belowmarket interest rates on 
loans to firsttime homebuyers and to developers of low and 
moderateincome housing 
the plan would pay for the bailout of the troubled thrift 
industry through contributions assessed on the financial industry 
including on money market funds and brokerage firms it would raise 
the maximum marginal income tax rate to 38 percent from 33 percent 
with part of the money going to the bailout 
at a news conference jackson said the bush plan would require 
all taxpayers to pay for the industry bailout and would unfairly 
put the cost of the industrys excesses on poor people and 
minorities who already had been hurt by industry discrimination in 
lending 
let those who had the party pay for the party jackson said 
it does not make sense that those who never were invited to the 
party should be asked to pay to clean up the mess only the 
wealthy were invited to the party 
the financial service companies and the wealthiest individual 
americans who benefited the most from soaring interest rates and 
buccaneer banking should bear the burden of cleaning up the mess 
jackson said 
rep henry b gonzales dtexas chairman of the house banking 
committee appeared at the news conference and supported the plan 
jackson blamed deregulation under the reagan administration for 
allowing savings and loans to end their historic commitment to 
small savers and home buyers while leaving buccaneer bankers free 
to gamble without risk facing neither the discipline of a free 
market the risk of bankruptcy nor the discipline of regulation 
the risk of prosecution

news corp ltd the australiabased international 
conglomerate controlled by rupert murdoch said thursday it was 
considering forming a separate company to acquire and develop media 
and communications businesses 
news corp would own at least 20 percent of the new company 
murdoch said in a statement 
in addition news corp would transfer to the new company its 
existing book publishing businesses a substantial portion of the 
proceeds from that transfer would be used to reduce outstanding 
indebtedness of news corp murdoch said 
a spokeswoman at news international plc news corps british 
subsidiary speaking on condition she not be identified would not 
elaborate on murdochs statement 
among the companys major book publishing interests are william 
collins plc which agreed to be acquired by news international for 
about 693 million in january and harper and row publishers inc of 
the united states acquired by news corp in 1987 for 300 million 
murdoch who serves as his companys chief executive said the 
price of news corps book publishing assets to be transferred to 
the new company would be determined by independent appraisal 
news corp has run up substantial debt through the 285 billion 
acquisition of triangle publications inc of the united states the 
publishers of tv guide and other magazines in october 
since then the australian company said it planned to reduce 
borrowings by selling more than 1 billion worth of assets by june 
30 
news corp recently sold the fox plaza building in los angeles 
and its interests in the us and british editions of elle magazine 
market speculation about what else murdoch might sell has centered 
on his australian television interests and various newspapers around 
the world 
the new company would raise capital globally through subsidiaries 
of the cs first boston group murdoch said besides being a major 
shareholder in the new company news corp also would act as adviser 
and provide management services 
although news corp would continue to pursue its own internal 
expansion it is intended that the primary vehicle for acquisitions 
above a certain size would be the new company murdoch said 
news corp chairman richard searby indicated in the statement 
that europe would be the geographic focus for expansion by the new 
company 
the imminent integration of the european market is creating 
vast investment opportunities for wellfinanced media organizations 
and the new company would be an active participant in an industry 
that will witness a decade of rapid change and growth he said 
the 12nation common market is to become one trade barrierfree 
market place by the end of 1992

the royal dutchshell group of companies the 
anglodutch oil giant said thursday its fourthquarter profit fell 
143 percent due mainly to a special charge and weak world crude 
oil prices 
the company based in the hague the netherlands and london 
said net income for the three months ended dec 31 totaled 702 
million pounds or 12 billion on an historical cost basis 
compared with 819 million pounds in the same period a year earlier 
royal dutchshell said it took a special charge of 67 million 
pounds during the quarter for an environmental cleanup of a former 
chemicals manufacturing site at rocky mountain arsenal property in 
colorado 
on a current cost basis which values the companys oil 
inventories at current market prices and is more comparable to the 
american accounting method of last in first out or lifo net income 
fell 19 percent to 765 million pounds or 13 billion from 943 
million pounds 
the pershare conversions into dollars were provided by the 
company 
sales in the fourth quarter fell 72 percent to 142 billion 
pounds or 244 billion from 153 billion pounds 
for the year net income rose 39 percent to 294 billion pounds 
or 51 billion on an historical cost basis from 283 billion 
pounds a year earlier 
on a current cost basis net income rose 128 percent to 317 
billion pounds or 55 billion from 281 billion pounds 
sales in 1988 fell 67 percent to 558 billion pounds or 96 
billion from 598 billion pounds a year ago 
the company said the annual profit improvement was curtailed by 
depressed exploration and production activities principally because 
of the decline in world crude oil prices and lower natural gas sales 
due to mild weather in europe 
however manufacturing marine and marketing earnings increased 
substantially the company said because of higher volumes and 
margins 
the company also reported that chemicals had an excellent year 
with buoyant demand for petrochemicals and high capacity utilization

the government on friday will issue a new 
version of its muchmaligned chief economic forecasting gauge but 
skeptical private analysts expect little improvement in the monthly 
reports track record 
the index of leading economic indicators sometimes derided by 
its critics as the index of misleading indicators is designed to 
foretell future economic activity by evaluating forwardpointing 
business statistics 
government policy makers and private investors watch the index 
closely for indications of strength or weakness in the us economy 
as much as six months in the future 
using data stretching back to 1948 the composite index has 
correctly predicted all eight recessions by dropping for at least 
three months in a row but it also forecast four recessions that 
never materialized 
januarys report to be issued friday will drop two of 11 
components from the index revise two others and feature two new 
indicators of economic activity 
larry moran a spokesman for the governments bureau of economic 
analysis said thursday the changes will make the index less prone 
to afterthefact revision less apt to make false predictions of 
future downturns and more precise at predicting when downturns will 
occur 
this old index is so good that it has predicted 12 of the 
last eight recessions he quipped the new index will be less 
inclined to give us false signals we hope it will be better at 
telling us when they downturns are going to occur 
private analysts said the changes are a step in the right 
direction but expectations arent running high 
economist bruce steinberg of merrill lynch amp co in new york says 
the revised index will be an improvement because it will produce 
fewer revisions but in terms of giving false signals its 
absolutely as prone as the old index to do that 
a bureau study of how the new index would have done if had been 
in the past in fact showed that its performance would have been 
similar to that of the old index 
marie hertzberg a bureau employee who worked on the revision 
said that while the index is not infallible it has been a leader 
its just another piece of information that can be used to analyze 
the economy 
is there anything that you put 100 percent reliance into on the 
economy she asked 
michael evans head of a washington consulting firm said his 
opinion of the leading index in the past has been minus 1 on a 
scale of 1 to 10 
with the revisions evans said his rating could rise maybe as 
high as zero it cant get any worse 
he said a major problem with the index is its failure to take 
into account future foreign demand for us goods 
you really cant predict the direction of the economy unless 
you have some idea of net exports evans said 
the bureau of economic analysis says it is continuing to review 
the index and is looking for ways to add a measure of future 
international activity but it has not yet found a reliable monthly 
indicator 
the two new indicators to be included starting friday are a 
university of michigan survey of consumer optimism and a measure of 
the change in manufacturers unfilled orders 
the two components that are being dropped changes in 
outstanding credit and the change in inventories on hand and on 
order were scrapped because uptodate data has not been available 
when the index first was compiled for a particular month the index 
for that month was later revised to include the updated information 
other factors in the index include average weekly initial claims 
for unemployment benefits an index of stock prices building 
permits and orders for new plants and equipment 
robert dederick chief economist for northern trust co in 
chicago said that while the indexs value is limited its 
something useful to have in the tool kit 
you just cant take it literally dederick said you have 
to apply a heavy dose of judgment to it and you have to do that 
just as much with the new one as with the old one 
economist robert defina of security pacific national bank in los 
angeles said his firm has given little credence to the index in the 
past 
were not going to look at the new index any more closely 
until it comes up with a proven track record defina added

americas borrowing binge is both a curse and a 
blessing to james grant author of an irreverent financial market 
newsletter whos made himself famous by expounding on the evils of 
debt 
his antipathy for deficits buyouts and bad lending practices has 
earned grant a reputation in the business world as a miserly party 
pooper in an era of unbridled excess 
but even people who disagree with him say grant is 
thoughtprovoking entertaining and may one day prove correct in his 
warnings that the system cannot live on borrowed money indefinitely 
i am out of step with the times the writer of the 
twicemonthly grants interest rate observer said in a speech 
last month to the conference of business economists in washington 
today he said it is possible to get a 40year mortgage loan 
a bulletstyle floatingrate homeequity loan a sixyear auto 
loan a sothebys artequity loan a 50 billion zerocoupon 
secured savingsandloan bailout loan and a highyield payment in 
kind lbo loan 
it is hard in fact not to get one or more of those loans if 
you have a functioning mailbox into which credit cards can be 
dropped 
little known six years ago when he started the newsletter grant 
now has 3000 subscribers who pay 375 a year to absorb his wit 
wisdom and statistics readers range from billionaire entrepreneurs 
malcolm forbes and laurence tisch to lbo strategist theodore 
forstmann and painewebber inc chief executive donald marron 
its always a pleasure to read that letter said leon levy a 
partner at odyssey partners a new york investment firm that pursues 
the kind of debtfinanced dealmaking grant routinely rails against 
it is witty lively anecdotal and to the point and i think 
the stories he tells are always quotable levy said and who can 
tell one of these days he may be right 
in recent issues grant has satirized the lousy credit rating of 
duff amp phelps corp a debtrating agency that tripled its own debt 
in a management buyout he termed citicorps new 15minute mortgage 
idea aimed at wooing customers with promises of quick approval for 
their loans the mcmortgage 
when a 20 billionplus bidding war broke out last year for rjr 
nabisco inc with rival suitors promising to finance a takeover 
almost entirely with borrowed money grants newsletter responded by 
printing a mock proposal for a 115 billion debtfinanced purchase 
of international business machines corp 
with these gnpsized deals parody seems more appropriate than 
commentary he said 
grant routinely admonishes against the purchase of junk bonds 
the highyield highrisk securities that evolved into the fuel for 
the 1980s debtfinanced takeover era 
he is equally suspicious of michael milken the drexel burnham 
lambert inc financier who helped transform junk bonds into a 175 
billion business and has been the target of a federal fraud 
investigation for more than two years 
grant once said he considers himself cast in the role of billy 
graham opposite a hugh hefner played by michael milken 
tall lanky with clark kent eyeglasses and selfeffacing smile 
the 42yearold writer works out of a rented office on the 40th 
floor of the woolworth building in southern manhattan an ornate 
skyscraper purchased by the retailing giants founder f w 
woolworth in 1913 for 135 million in cash 
its one of the few prime properties on the worlds most 
expensive piece of real estate that has no mortgage or lien on it 
grant tells visitors adding i wouldnt rent anywhere else 
a native long islander grant got into writing after graduating 
indiana university and the columbia school of international affairs 
he was a creditmarkets columnist at barrons financial weekly for 
eight years before quitting to start the newsletter in 1983 
grant has said he never intended for interest rate observer 
to evolve into a critique of credit but the relentless pace of 
borrowing in the economy increasingly alarmed him and reshaped the 
newsletters focus 
it was the 1984 debtrefinancing of metromedia inc five years 
ago largely though the sale of what then was the largest junkbond 
offering in history that helped convince grant of the dangers 
lurking in such deals 
grant doesnt oppose the concept of debt but he says the greater 
the level of borrowed money greasing the economy the greater the 
chance the debt wont be repaid inciting a chain reaction of events 
that inevitably will mean sharply higher interest rates 
unemployment and recession 
debt magnifies results he said in an interview its 
magnified the business expansion of the past six years bringing in 
marginal consumers and helping employ marginal workers but when 
debt becomes available on more onerous terms well see the 
amplification on the downside 
as for his own financial health grant said the newsletter is 
supporting him and wife patricia kavanagh who quit her job as a 
wall street investment banker to help him publish it they have four 
children aged 1 to 8 
grant and his family arent totally immune from the enticements 
of borrowing the credit cards in his wallet attest to that 
we have a lot of them he said we try not to use too many 
at once

share prices closed higher near their session 
peaks on thursday encouraged by the pounds recovery and a strong 
early trend on wall street 
the market recovered its poise after a nervous morning session 
with players trying to assess conflicting signals on the outlook for 
british interest rates 
the west german central banks decision to leave its key interest 
rate unchanged after its regular council meeting helped ease earlier 
fears that british rates would have to rise simply to keep pace with 
a west german rate hike 
the unchanged west german rates helped the pound recover from an 
early slide which had reportedly prompted the bank of england to 
intervene several times to prop up sterling 
some players still feared another bout of sterling weakness could 
force the britsh government to signal an increase in the british 
commercial banks base lending rate from its current 13 percent 
level 
but many analysts said they believed the government is reluctant 
for political reasons to raise rates ahead of chancellor of the 
exchequer nigel lawsons march 14 budget statement despite the 
release wednesday of another set of poor british trade figures 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index closed 184 
points or 09 percent higher at 20397 
volume was a moderate 4839 million shares down from 5354

federal mediators said thursday that one side 
in the dispute between eastern airlines and the machinists union 
had made a new contract offer and negotiators were hopeful it 
might be the kind of breakthrough we are looking for to avert a 
strike 
walter c wallace chairman of the naional mediation board said 
representatives of the airline and the 8500member union had met in 
washington in the 17month labor dispute 
he declined to say which side had made the offer or what it 
contained 
we are assured by both sides that they want to reach a 
settlement wallace told a news conference 
the board asked president bush last week to call a special panel 
that would delay the strike 60 days beyond a midnight friday 
deadline 
wallace said the parties were evaluating the offer and would meet 
later separately with board mediators in hopes of reaching a 
settlement 
there has been action that hopefully might be the kind of 
breakthrough we are looking for theres been some movement 
wallace said 
harry bickford chief mediator in the dispute said there is 
an amended proposal made from one party to the other and its under 
consideration he said it was the first change in the negotiations 
in several weeks

a snapshot of silicon valley and a look 
at the books of the computer chip makers that dot the landscape 
reveal few signs of the impending trouble suggested by recent 
forecasts 
trade war cries against japan heard so often during the 
mid1980s have mellowed and there is a feeling that the bush 
administration will push japan to open its markets more to us 
companies 
there are indications the bush administration will be more 
forceful than the reagan administration and not just reactive to 
congress said wilfred j corrigan chairman and chief executive 
officer of lsi logic corp i dont think the bush administration 
is just going to lay down and let japan violate the trade agreement 
i think theyre going to force japan to open up 
doomsayers were prominent in the aftermath of a fourthquarter 
earnings decline at valley leader intel corp and losses and 
layoffs at national semiconductor corp and advanced micro devices 
inc 
the layoffs of 2000 workers at national semiconductor in january 
and 2400 at amd last year were interpreted by some people as 
evidence that american chip makers are in fullfledged retreat 
against their japanese rivals 
yet intel remains strong and the other two companies could bounce 
back quickly with a pickup in demand from the computer industry the 
big three in the valley together account for more than 55 billion 
in annual revenue 
meanwhile the good times are rolling elsewhere in americas 
electronic heartland 
unemployment is low barely above 3 percent with 192500 of 
the 813700 workers in santa clara county holding jobs in the 
electronics industry at years end industry figures show 
housing prices up to 600000 for a threebedroom home are 
among the highest in the country posh restaurants are busy and the 
streets are lined with expensive cars 
inside the companies researchers are keeping ahead of the 
japanese in the high end of the microprocessor market with fast 
powerful products such as a new chip from intel capable of 
executing 150 million operations per second 
us and japanese chip makers are spending roughly equal amounts 
of money on researchanddevelopment and capial improvements as a 
percentage of revenue in each industry 
but japans dominance of the giant memory business including the 
dynamic random access memory chips drams that were in short supply 
last year is giving it the edge in semiconductor manufacturing 
techniques the japanese also are adding capacity faster than their 
american counterparts 
for the moment though japanese companies seeking advanced 
highperformance components have to go to us rivals to license the 
technology at least in the critical area of microprocessors 
intel plans to introduce another speed demon later this year 
the 80486 microprocessor an upgrade of the 80386 that is the 
central component of the most advanced personal computers made by 
international business machines corp and many other manufacturers 
intels earnings dipped 10 percent in the fourth quarter but it 
still had a superb year with revenues up 51 percent to 29 billion 
and net income soaring 83 percent to 453 million 
more than a dozen other local chip companies ranging from tiny 
startups to middle tier veterans like lsi logic and cypress 
semiconductor corp also are turning profits in niches of the 
industry 
lsi logic which grew 45 percent last year to 379 million in 
revenues is riding atop the burgeoning field of custom chips 
gazelle microcircuits inc is leaping ahead with highperformance 
gallium arsenide chips 
growth in chip sales overall this year is slow as computer 
companies burn off some inventory and cut back purchases but 
several segments of the industry especially the custom chips and 
highperformance microprocessors are expected to do well 
world to be flat in 89 warned a yearend report from instat 
inc a market research firm in scottsdale ariz analyst forecasts 
for 1989 ranged from minus 12 percent chip sales for the year to 
plus 10 percent quite a comedown from the 35 percent growth in 1988 
and 21 percent in 1987 
forecasting growth patterns is difficult its all black magic 
when you come right down to it said michael boss of dataquest 
inc a market research firm in san jose 
boss who is sticking with dataquests 10 percent growth 
forecast was cheered a little when the january booktobill ratio 
a key gauge of industry health edged up for the first time in four 
months 
yet whether the industry grows or shrinks a little this year 
the superficial picture of health misses a pervasive problem the 
united states is losing worldwide market share and the trend 
suggests that will continue it is not necessarily a doomsday 
scenario but it is worrisome for the valley and the nation 
americas share of the economically and strategically important 
chip industry it invented will drop to about 35 percent worldwide 
within four years says dataquest 
the chip makers whose tiny circuits run electronic products from 
microwave ovens to corporate computers and defense department 
satellites still will have plenty of opportunities to cash in as 
the overall market expands but the bigger problem facing the valley 
and the united states analysts say is the effect of not 
participating at all in key segments of the electronics industry 
high definition television is the latest area of consumer 
technology that has been largely ignored by american companies while 
japan has been making advances 
loss of the spinoff business from a new generation of television 
would be even more disastrous than losses from americas abandonment 
of video cassette recorders and compact disk players according to a 
study by the american electronics association 
in both cases segments of the us semiconductor industry simply 
disappeared because there was no incentive for chip companies to 
invest in those areas if the only buyers were japanese manufacturers 
american chip companies are not going to spend millions of 
dollars developing a product that is uniquely suited for a japanese 
market unless their success in that market is better than in the 
past said boss

soybean futures prices closed with a powerful 
surge thursday on the chicago board of trade as talk of soviet 
buying interest triggered some of the most active trading so far 
this year 
corn and oat futures also advanced but wheat futures retreated in 
reaction to needed precipitation in major us winter wheat areas 
unconfirmed rumors of soviet plans to purchase us corn and 
possibly some soybean meal touched off the late rally in those 
markets analysts said 
the reaction was especially pronounced in the soybean market 
which has become increasingly sensitive to demand factors as soybean 
supplies have tightened a function of last summers drought 
in the face of no current supplies and users all being 
handtomouth the market can blow up on you said cathy leow a 
grain market analyst with thomson mckinnon securities inc in new 
york whenever you get a little demand at all it explodes 
at the close wheat was 2 cents to 4 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in march at 436 a bushel corn was 1 cent to 
3 cents higher with march at 275 a bushel oats were 2 cents to 
6 cents higher with march at 209 a bushel soybeans were 9 cents 
to 20 cents higher with march at 768 a bushel

a mere hint of soviet buying interest sent the jittery soybean 
futures market into a powerful rally thursday on the chicago board 
of trade and sparked some of the most active trading so far this 
year 
corn and oat futures also advanced but wheat futures retreated 
following wednesdays runup on rumors which were confirmed 
thursday that the soviet union had purchased 485000 metric tons of 
us wheat at subsidized prices 
on other markets thursday energy futures surged livestock and 
meat advanced copper futures gained and precious metals were 
narrowly mixed 
soybeans settled 11 cents to 20 cents higher with the contract 
for delivery in march at 767 a bushel wheat was 2 cents to 3 
cents lower with march at 436 a bushel corn was 1 cent to 3 
cents higher with march at 275 a bushel oats were 2 cents to 6 
cents higher with march at 208 a bushel 
unconfirmed rumors of soviet plans to purchase us corn and 
possibly some soybean meal touched off the late rally on the board 
of trade analysts said 
the reaction was especially pronounced in the soybean market 
which has become increasingly sensitive to demand factors as soybean 
supplies have tightened a function of last summers drought 
in the face of no current supplies and users all being 
handtomouth the market can blow up on you said cathy leow a 
grain market analyst with thomson mckinnon securities inc in new 
york whenever you get a little demand at all it explodes 
traders said the rally accelerated after the may soybean contract 
surpassed 775 a bushel triggering waves of computerdriven 
speculative fund buying 
the supply tightness is expected to ease in midapril when the 
south american soybean harvest begins 
but us weather concerns may have taken precedence by then as 
the market weighs the prospects for a second year of drought 
if the weather is good well have trouble going much higher if 
the weathers bad well go a lot higher said victor lespinasse 
a trader with dean witter reynolds inc in chicago 
energy futures rose sharply on the new york mercantile exchange 
following reports that nonopec countries including the soviet 
union and china may cut their crudeoil exports by about 400000 
barrels per day in the second quarter 
the market had been expecting a cutback by those producers of 
less than 200000 barrels per day 
the cutbacks which have not been officially announced would 
support the efforts of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries to bolster oil prices 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 20 cents to 44 cents 
higher with april at 1872 a barrel heating oil was 84 cent to 
138 cent higher with april at 5187 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 45 cent to 65 cent higher with april at 5221 cents a 
gallon 
cattle futures surged on the chicago mercantile exchange as 
continued strong cash prices defied expectations for a decline live 
cattle fetched as much as 79 per hundredweight in kansas

as eastern airlines careens toward what could be 
its final conflict the besieged carriers managers face bitter 
choices like bankruptcy asset auctions or a takeover at a firesale 
price 
the economic impact of those scenarios would be felt deeply in 
florida and across the gamut of 118 cities where eastern operates in 
the united states the caribbean and latin america 
eastern employs around 31200 people including 10200 at its 
miami headquarters 6700 in atlanta and 3200 in new york in south 
florida alone the airline spent 5412 million last year on 
salaries and other employee benefits and 111 million on fees at 
three airports 
as a strike deadline against eastern of 1201 am est saturday 
loomed federal mediators expressed some hope for a settlement of 
the contract dispute between the moneylosing airline and its 
militant machinists union 
president bush still was weighing whether to step in and avert 
the impending strike as the national mediation board has 
recommended 
if there is a strike of more than a few days that will be the 
end of eastern as we know it said louis marckesano an airline 
analyst at janney montgomery scott inc in philadelphia 
his warning reflects the assessment of many analysts and other 
observers 
eastern recently reported a record net loss of 3354 million in 
1988 nearly double its 1817 million loss the year before revenue 
dropped to 38 billion from 44 billion in 1987 
the airline has a crushing 25 billion or so in debt 
its obviously a situation thats heading fast for the edge of 
the cliff i see the prospect of bankruptcy as a real potential 
outcome here farrell kupersmith a financial consultant to the 
air line pilots association recently told a gathering of analysts 
kupersmith an associate managing partner of the touche ross amp 
co accounting firm represented creditors of continental airlines 
after that carrier was put into bankruptcy in september 1983 by 
texas air corp chairman frank lorenzo texas air lorenzos 
houstonbased holding company owns eastern and continental 
after the bankruptcy filing the steelytough lorenzo 
restructured continental and slashed the number of employees to 
around 4000 from 12500 
several observers believe an eastern bankruptcy could follow a 
series of events notably sales of assets such as planes airport 
gates and landing rights after the assets had been stripped off 
they suggest lorenzo could then put the remaining shell company 
under protection from creditors under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy 
laws 
lorenzo would have a tougher time putting eastern into chapter 11 
and sacking employees than he did with continental but he could 
still do it as a result of amendments to the bankruptcy laws passed 
in 1985 the texas air chief would first have to negotiate further 
with the eastern unions and demonstrate that he had no other 
alternative 
i dont see bankruptcy as being an immediate possibility 
said paul karos who follows the industry for first boston corp 
its a very last resort 
another possible scenario is a takeover by outsiders something 
the eastern unions have been trying to engineer for some time 
takeover strategist carl icahn head of trans world airlines 
inc has been lurking in the wings for months as a potential 
acquirer of eastern and is still there according to observers and 
union sources icahn may be hoping to pick up what remains of 
eastern at a firesale price analysts suggest 
icahn has said publicly that eastern with its domestic routes 
would fit nicely as a feeder into twas international network 
other investor groups remain interested in eastern the sources 
say although neither they nor icahn has made a formal offer 
selling eastern as an integral unit is lorenzos ace in the 
hole analyst marckesano said

common market environment ministers 
thursday agreed to try to outlaw production and use of chemicals 
that have been blamed for jeopardizing the earths ozone layer 
the ministers from the 12nation european economic community 
agreed that they would try to obtain a total ban by the end of this 
century on the production and use of chlorofluorocarbon or cfc 
compounds 
they also decided to seek an 85 percent cutback in production as 
soon as possible 
these compounds practically indestructible are found in 
refrigeration fluids foamblowing agents cleaning solvents and 
outside north america and scandinavia aerosol propellants they 
have found wide use because they are nontoxic and do not burn 
cfcs are widely blamed for depleting the ozone a problem which 
greenpeace the international environmental organization claimed is 
out of control 
the ozone layer deflects much of the suns harmful ultraviolet 
rays and protects human health crops sea life and certain 
industrial materials according to greenpeace 
the ministers agreed to give the eec commission a mandate to 
obtain a complete phase out of the manufacture and use of cfcs by 
the year 2000 the commission will represent the 12 nations at the 
international conferences being held this year to discuss the ozone 
issue and monitor application of the montreal protocol 
this protocol signed by 40 countries and ratified by 32 which 
took effect jan 1 is aimed at reducing output and use of cfcs by 
50 percent from current levels by 1998 
the eec ban would only affect cfcs covered by the montreal 
protocol 
the eec ministers also gave a mandate to the commission to 
encourage other countries to sign and ratify the protocol 
the eec member states are responsible for about half the worlds 
annual cfc production of a million tons with britain leading in 
both production and exports according to greenpeace britain 
exported cfcs to 117 countries in 1988 81 of which had not signed 
the montreal protocol 
greenpeace said that between 1979 and 1986 the ozone layer over 
the eec has already been depleted by an average of 3 percent this 
rises to nearly 7 percent in the winter 
scientists have warned that further depletion of the ozone layer 
would warm the earth lead to increasing desertification melt part 
of the polar icecaps raise the sea level and flood parts of 
lowlying countries 
they have also warned that a thinning of the ozone layer which 
lies in the earths stratosphere would increase the numbers of skin 
cancers according to greenpeace each 1 percent depletion is 
estimated to increase the incidence of skin cancers by around 4 
percent 
ministers from countries which have ratified the montreal 
protocol are due to meet in london from march 5 to 7 and a further 
conference is scheduled in helskinki finland from may 2 to 5 to 
monitor the application of the protocol

cooper industries incs buyout of champion 
spark plug co may cost more than the 707 million in cash the 
houstonbased company is offering because of wall street activity 
an auto industry analyst said thursday 
cooper offered on feb 6 to buy champion for 21 a share the 
merger agreement approved by the boards of directors of cooper and 
champion on feb 22 
since cooper announced it would buy champion gabelli group inc 
a new york investment company has reduced its 176 percent stake in 
champion to about 14 percent 
the gabelli group sold off 376650 shares of champion common 
stock at between 2250 to 23 a share between feb 13 and feb 24 
according to securities and exchange commission filing on wednesday 
the group had been managing about 6 million shares of champion stock 
for investors 
in addition champion stock has steadily been trading above 21 a 
share on the new york stock exchange 
cooper may have to increase its 21ashare offer to buy 501 
percent of champion stock said william prebe an auto analyst and 
former vice president for dana corp an automotive giant that had 
made a bid to buy champion 
gabelli could be creating market activity to get the price 
up prebe said cooper might not be able to get 50 percent of 
the shares and if cooper cannot get 50 percent they are going to 
have to increase their tender offer 
if he gabelli is selling at 22 a share someone has got to 
be buying he might be convincing a buyer that the price will even 
go higher he said 
several telephone messages left thursday for mario gabelli 
manager of the gabelli group were not returned 
prebe and other auto industry analysts have said it was unlikely 
that another company would make a bid for champion 
under the terms of the deal cooper is making a 21ashare cash 
tender offer for all of champions 336 million shares of 
outstanding common stock 
the deal including debt reduction legal fees and other 
considerations brings the total purchase price to about 800 
million 
the tender offer which began feb 24 is scheduled to march 22 
with the merger taking place after may 1 cooper spokeswoman ellen 
meyers said the company wont reveal how many shares have been 
tendered until after march 22 
she also declined comment on speculation that the company may 
have to increase its tender offer 
i dont think we want to speculate on what the merger will cost 
the company or the stocks activity she said 
auto analysts say the key to the deal is whether chinook partners 
lp will tender its shares a move that could lock up the deal for 
cooper 
chinook was established in 1986 by the founding stranahan family 
to maintain a dominant voice in champions affairs it controls 35 
percent of champions common stock 
i think the chinook group will wait to the last minute before 
tendering their shares because they want to get the best price 
prebe said 
champion is the worlds leading manufacturer of spark plugs for 
all types of internal combustion engines it has annual revenue of 
about 720 million and employs about 9200 people worldwide 
cooper with 1988 revenue of 43 billion is a diversified 
worldwide manufacturer of products from the electrical electronic 
commercial industrial compression and drilling markets

the farm credit system reported wednesday that 
its fourthquarter net income jumped 51 percent over the previous 
year and that it earned a profit for all of 1988 
the system said it netted 270 million in the three months ended 
dec 31 compared with earnings of 179 million in the 1987 period 
for the year it earned 704 million vs a 17 million loss in 
the previous year 
alan fass president and chief executive officer of the federal 
farm credit banks funding corp the financing arm of the farm 
credit system attributed the improvements largely to fewer loan 
losses also contributing to the positive results were increased net 
interest income and a gain on the sales of certain properties he 
said 
positive trends in the farm economy and the systems own 
efforts to reduce nonearning assets deliver credit more 
efficiently and increase net interest income are making a difference 
in the bottom line fass said in a statement 
net interest income rose to 216 million from 156 million during 
the fourth quarter and to 787 million from 509 million for the 
year 
the system said that net interest income increased throughout 
1988 as a result of higher cash payments on nonaccrual loans and 
reinstatements of nonaccrual loans to accrual status 
when loans are placed on nonaccrual status they are accounted for 
only as they come in rather than when they are due 
offsetting last years positive factors though were 
extraordinary charges of 174 million related to the debt 
restructuring of three farm credit banks 
the 1988 net income also included the recognition of 255 million 
in losses relating to the federal land bank of jackson which was 
placed into receivership on may 20 
the farm credit system is a nationwide system of federally 
chartered agricultural lending institutions serving the rural 
economy and cooperatively owned by their borrowers 
the system took several steps last year to streamline its 
structure following 1987 legislation that included the issuance of 
up to 4 billion in governmentbacked lowinterest loans

the federal trade commission said thursday that 
detroitarea auto dealers broke federal antitrust laws by agreeing 
among themselves to close showrooms on saturdays and most weekday 
evenings 
the dealers were ordered to remain open 64 hours each week for a 
year the dealers association said an appeal would be filed 
the ftcs action overturned a 1987 decision by a federal 
administrative law judge that declared the dealers justified in 
limiting hours because they were seeking peace with their unions 
rather than higher profits 
but ftc chairman daniel oliver said the agreement on showroom 
hours was improper because it was not part of a labor negotiation 
process 
on the contrary he wrote in the ftc opinion the dealers admit 
that to the extent the agreement was motivated by labor concerns 
it was designed to prevent collective bargaining 
an agreement to limit shopping hours is the same as an agreement 
to raise prices oliver wrote the evidence indicates that 
respondents expected the hours restriction to benefit them by 
limiting comparison shopping he wrote 
the ftc complaint charged that the dealers had conspired to limit 
their hours of business since 1960 
most car dealers in the detroit area are open past 6 pm only on 
monday and thursday nights they are closed on saturdays and blue 
laws bar sunday hours 
dealerships elsewhere in the nation typically are open on 
weekends 
evidence heard by the ftc said the saturday closings were 
enforced against recalcitrant dealerships with picket lines 
threats violence and vandalism including gunshots through windows 
at one dealership 
last april six shotgun blasts peppered the large front windows 
of the key motor mall showroom in warren owner leo jerome believed 
the shots were linked to him keeping his business open on saturday 
there have been no arrests despite his offer of a 25000 reward 
jones said thursday he had mixed feelings about the ftc ruling 
he said he was happy because his position was upheld but concerned 
because the government was telling him how many hours he had to be 
open normally his showroom is open 61 hours a week 
now by federal mandate i have to be open another night or 
another three hours on saturday he said already my people are 
stretched out timewise 
under the ftc opinion which named 53 dealerships 78 
individuals the detroit auto dealers association and 16 other 
automotive associations each detroitarea dealer can set its own 
hours as long as the 64houraweek minimum is met 
the hours of operation must be conspicuously posted at each 
dealership 
moreover the detroit auto dealers association will be required 
to place at least four newspaper advertisements a week for at least 
four weeks explaining that the ftc order prompted the extended 
shopping hours 
the dealers have 20 days in which to ask the ftc to reconsider 
its decision a rarely used procedure or within 30 days could 
appeal directly to a federal appellate court

we believe that the following reforms would help resolve these 
problems and improve the congressional budget process 
there is no reason why the congress should adopt a completely 
new budget plan every year a twoyear budget would ease that burden 
and would give the executive branch a better opportunity to achieve 
real savings 
we recommend using current year outlays rather than the current 
services budget as the benchmark for the following years budget 
much of the delay under current procedures can be attributed to 
differences between the two houses of congress replacing the two 
budget committees with a joint committee on the budget would force 
the congress to confront these differences earlier in the year some 
method should be found to reduce the duplication inherent in the 
present system of separate authorization and appropriations 
committees 
at present the president is not a party to the budget 
resolution it is simply an agreement between the two houses 
requiring the presidents signature on the budget resolution if he 
approves would ensure that he was part of the process from the 
beginning 
failure to adopt a budget resolution greatly delays the 
enactment of appropriations bills we support the idea of an 
automatic budget resolution at the grammrudmanhollings sequester 
level to become effective on may 15 if congress has failed to agree 
on a budget resolution 
the use of omnibus fullyear appropriation bills has been 
roundly and justifiably condemned an automatic continuing 
resolution with appropriations at the previous years level with no 
adjustment for inflation would eliminate the use of these omnibus 
bills 
in addition to these measures we believe that steps should be 
taken to enhance the presidents power to rescind appropriations or 
to veto line items the balance of power on budget issues has swung 
too far from the executive and toward the legislative branch 
we also support a constitutional amendment to require a balanced 
budget with limits in revenues that can be collected 
until the process is improved it is evident that budget 
decisions will have to be confirmed through an agreement between the 
president and congress like the agreement reached at the end of 
1987 such an agreement will only be effective if the public and 
financial markets are confident that it will be observed 
we share the growing concern about the treatment of social 
security in the calculation of the deficit we support the principle 
of a unified budget as laid out by the 1968 presidents commission 
on budget concepts however we also recognize that the social 
security surpluses accumulated to pay future liabilities must be 
protected 
toward that end we support the enactment of legislation to 
establish deficit or surplus targets whose purpose would be to 
eliminate gradually the nonsocial security deficit so long as our 
defense and national security interests are not harmed

continuous wear with no cleaning required before being discarded 
the company began selling the lenses last year in boston florida 
and california 
the lenses will be available through selected eye care 
practitioners said company spokesman rick kase 
disposable contact lenses are becoming the latest hot product in 
the eye care industry 
earlier this week the atlantabased ciba vision announced plans 
to begin selling its own brand of disposable lenses called newvue 
johnson amp johnson was the first company to introduce the throwaway 
lenses two years ago 
the three companies and eye doctors tout the disposable trend as 
healthier for the wearers eyes but some industry analysts wonder 
if people are ready to pay the price to have contact lenses they can 
discard 
a pair of soft contact lenses may cost about 100 and last for at 
least a year but a package of disposable lenses may cost between 
300 and 500 and last a year

shamrock holdings inc filed suit 
thursday in us district court in delaware against polaroid corps 
plan to buy back 11 billion of stock 
the complaint alleges polaroid has given its shareholders 
misleading information about its future earnings and possible damage 
payments arising from patent infringements by eastman kodak co 
polaroid denied the allegation the companies agreed to argue the 
case on march 15 before judge caleb wright so that a decision can be 
rendered before the buyback offer expires march 20 
shamrock a radio and television concern based in burbank 
calif has made a 45ashare hostile tender offer valued at 32 
billion for polaroid shamrock is also waging a proxy battle for 
control of polaroids board of directors at the may 9 annual meeting 
polaroid the instant camera and film company based here will 
significantly strengthen its position in the proxy battle if its 
stock buyback plan is upheld by the court 
polaroid is offering 50 a share for 16 million shares or 22 
percent of its outstanding common stock 
shamrock controlled by the roy e disney family asked the court 
to enjoin polaroid from repurchasing any shares 
in describing its buyback plan polaroid projected growth rates 
of 12 percent to 16 percent for both sales and profits from 1990 to 
1995 it also said it could receive several billion dollars in 
damages from kodak but it inserted cautionary language telling 
stockholders not to rely on those figures 
shamrock contends the figures are unduly optimistic and that the 
boilerplate disclaimers are not sufficient it contends polaroid 
is unfairly trying to improve incumbent managements chances of 
winning the proxy battle 
polaroid in response said shamrocks lawsuit is without merit 
and is merely another selfserving attempt by shamrock to further 
its objective of acquiring polaroid at a price the board has 
determined to be inadequate

two big advertisers have quit buying time on 
the racy television comedy married with children and others 
have spurned selected episodes for fear of offending consumers 
executives said thursday 
some advertising insiders expect such decisions to become more 
common as tv entertainment shows carry more raunchy humor and 
profanity and socalled tabloid tv programs delve into kinky sex 
devil worship and similarly salacious subjects 
others say controversy over content is as old as television and 
that recent advertiser defections from married with children 
are no more likely to have a lasting effect than did controversy 
over all in the family a decade ago 
some defectors from married which is the fledgling fox 
broadcasting cos toprated show were influenced by an energetic 
letterwriting campaign by a detroitarea mother terry rakolta 
spokesmen said 
the show a situation comedy about a bluecollar family named 
bundy includes references to sex and bathroom humor and frequently 
portrays the husband berating his wife 
two advertisers procter amp gamble co and american home products 
corp bought some ads on the show but have decided against further 
sponsorship spokesmen said thursday johnson amp johnson and 
mcdonalds corp officials said they decided against running 
national advertising on the show though individual locally 
purchased ads had run 
cocacola usa whose president ira herbert wrote an apology to 
mrs rakolta continues to screen married episodes for content 
but hasnt found one suitable for advertising since her complaint 
jan 15 said spokesman tony tortorici 
advertisers concerns were summed up by procter amp gamble 
spokeswoman kelly gillespie we felt that the whole theme of the 
show is basically one we do not want to be associated with we were 
concerned about the negative portrayal of american family life 
fox which purposefully appeals to the young adult audiences 
sought by advertisers in its effort to build a fourth television 
network hasnt had any trouble selling ads on the show which airs 
sunday evenings said spokesman brad turell 
the show is completely sold out he said adding that news 
reports of mrs rakoltas campaign prompted calls of support from 
viewers 
we have received literally hundreds of telephone calls today 
from across the country from viewers saying that this one womans 
opinion is getting too much attention and hoping that we wont 
change the show turell said 
procter amp gamble which makes hundreds of household products and 
is the nations secondlargest advertiser bought ads on several 
married episodes last year stopped from october through 
december and then sponsored two shows in january ms gillespie 
said after receiving mrs rakoltas letter officials reviewed the 
show and decided against further ads she said 
american home products which makes goods as diverse as jiffy pop 
and woolite had already decided to disassociate itself from the 
show before receiving mrs rakoltas letter said spokeswoman carol 
emerling in new york 
tambrands inc which produces feminine hygiene products such as 
tampax tampons planned to advertise on two married episodes but 
canceled the second after a review prompted by mrs rakoltas 
letters said paul konney a spokesman at the companys new york 
headquarters 
advertisers face a dilemma in deciding whether to sponsor racy 
shows which often attract big audiences but may offend some vocal 
consumers 
tabloid tv shows such as geraldo and foxs a current 
affair have difficulty attracting advertisers because of what many 
see as their exploitation of the weaker side of humanity 
a recent survey of advertisers and ad buyers found resistance to 
such shows topped by the often outrageous the morton downey jr 
talk show said dean mccarthy vice president of harrington righter 
amp parsons a new york firm that helps television stations sell air 
time 
virtually all big companies have guidelines for what kind of 
shows are acceptable for their ads and most hire screening 
companies to check shows in advance for problems 
as television presses the outer limits of conventional taste 
sparked in part by looser federal regulations and increased 
competition among the various media for ads finding an appropriate 
spot for an ad can get difficult said mcdonalds spokeswoman 
stephanie skurdy 
ours is a childrens and family business ms skurdy said 
from the companys oak brook ill headquarters it has become 
increasingly difficult to find family programming on primetime 
television 
i think the amount of sexuality portrayed on television today 
is increasing dramatically said hal katz executive vice 
president of vitt media international inc a new york ad buyer 
as it increases advertisers become more sensitive to it 
but paul isaacson vice president of young amp rubicam a new york 
advertising agency said complaints about shows content dont 
appear any more frequent now than they ever have 
those who seek to influence television content through pressure 
on advertisers are attempting censorship said carol sobel an 
american civil liberties union attorney who has dealt with free 
speech issues 
if you dont want to watch it then dont watch it ms sobel 
said

eastern airlines offered a new contract 
proposal to its machinists union thursday and federal mediators 
expressed hope of averting a friday midnight strike that could 
disrupt travel nationwide 
the union said the company offer was an improvement but still 
called for pay cuts rather than pay hikes and strike preparations 
were continuing further talks also were expected mediators said 
eastern pilots meanwhile rejected a separate company offer 
designed to keep them from staging a sympathy strike with the 
machinists both the pilots and flight attendants said they would 
refuse to cross picket lines if a strike is called after the end of 
a federally imposed coolingoff friday night 
aflcio president lane kirkland said all union workers should 
honor machinist picket lines which other union officials have said 
could be put up at other airlines and transportation companies in 
addition to eastern 
kirkland accused frank lorenzo owner of texas air corp which is 
easterns parent company of finding it worth his while to 
purchase a good company and strip its assets rather than operate it 
fairly and decently 
kirkland asked president bush to follow a national mediation 
board request and call a special panel that would delay a strike for 
60 days 
bush plans to meet with top advisers on the situation on friday 
eastern opposes presidential action saying it is losing 1 
million a day and cant afford delay in making salary cuts it has 
proposed it had originally asked 150 million in cuts but union 
official wally haber in miami said the new offer was less stringent 
the company is still looking for major concessions but its 
not 150 million haber said 
the union has been asking for 50 million in raises 
sen edward kennedy dmass said a letter to bush signed by a 
third of the senate urged him to step in noting that eastern serves 
102 cities throughout north and south america with 60 us cities 
in 27 states dependent on the airline for passenger and freight 
service 
any interruption in this service will result in a major 
disruptin of interstate commerce the letter said 
kennedy noted that no president has ever refused to act on a 
mediation board recommendation to call a special panel 
eastern said its new offer would give mechanics a pay reduction 
that still keeps their salaries 13 percent higher than all other 
employees who took a 20 percent pay cut when lorenzo took over the 
company in 1986 it said baggage handlers would receive no greater 
cuts than other employees 
the company said the offer would give 8500 mechanics baggage 
handlers and other ground workers five years of job security and 
provides a strong financial incentive for eastern to grow and 
avoid further downsizing to cope with its financial difficulties 
weve been seeking a negotiated settlement all along and 
anything that moves us in that direction is welcome and we remain 
hopeful we can work out a negotiated agreement prior to the midnight 
deadline said airline spokesman robin matell in miami 
union president william winpisinger who was not participating in 
the talks said he had not heard of any new offer but added if 
theres movement indicated maybe theres a possibility well get it 
settled 
walter c wallace national mediation board chairman announced 
that a new offer was made in talks thursday but declined to say 
which side made it 
there has been action that hopefully might be the kind of 
breakthrough we are looking for theres been some movement 
wallace said 
he said the parties were evaluating the offer and would meet 
separately later with board mediators in hopes of reaching a 
settlement in the 17month dispute 
we are assured by both sides that they want to reach a 
settlement wallace told a news conference 
wallace said it would be possible for the union and the airline 
to stop the clock if negotiations continued past friday midnight 
easterns 3500 pilots meanwhile who were wooed ardently by 
management hoping they will not cross machinists picket lines 
rejected an eastern proposal the company said included sweetened pay 
and other promises 
the companys proposal and the manner in which they have sent 
it forth proves to us that management is not interested in any 
earnest efforts to resolve the current labor situation at eastern 
said john j bavis chairman of the eastern air lines pilots master 
executive council bavis called the offer a public relations 
gimmick 
the threatened strike has sent travelers scrambling for other 
carriers and lorenzo warned a sympathy walkout by pilots could bury 
the 60yearold company in the corporate graveyard 
mechanics have been taking home personal equipment boxes and 
tools fearing they might be locked out before the strike wearing 
red union tshirts machinists were handing leaflets to travelers at 
miami international airport 
the union contends its members can picket any transportation 
company covered by the railway labor act which includes airlines 
railroads and some shipping concerns the parent union the 
international association of machinists has been seeking an order 
from a federal judge in washington clarifying the unions strike 
rights under that law 
other airlines contend their machinists and fellow airline 
workers would be violating nostrike clauses in their contracts if 
they honored picket lines set up by eastern strikers 
northwest united airlines usair and piedmont airlines all have 
sued to block potential job actions by their machinists 
eastern said it will continue flying during a strike although 
company officials refused to disclose contingency plans the company 
promised passengers would be rerouted or given refunds on any 
canceled flights but ticket agents reported a surge in sales at 
eastern competitors 
some carriers have stopped short of promising to honor all 
eastern tickets fearing the company could declare bankruptcy

the automobile industry and its reliance on 
incentives is being tested this month as car and truck sales 
nationwide show signs of softening compared with last year chrysler 
corps vice chairman said thursday 
gerald greenwald said incentives which have become entrenched in 
automobile selling during the last few years arent as common as 
they were last year 
meantime weve seen some slackening of traffic in dealerships 
throughout the country he said 
some people speculate that normal winter patterns are causing the 
downturn in sales but were about to be put to a test 
here we are in the month of march that is usually a very strong 
selling month he said at a news conference 
february sales figures are due out friday through feb 20 sales 
of cars and trucks had fallen 32 percent compared with last year 
when as greenwald said blockbuster incentives were in effect 
if the overall question is do i expect to see incentives 
continuing yeah i do he told reporters 
greenwalds comments came before he addressed a banquet at the 
annual meeting of the society of automotive engineers 
separately ford motor co said thursday it had extended for two 
months a sales incentive program scheduled to expire thursday and 
will add to it including a rebate of up to 4000 on the imported 
merkur xr4ti 
the nations no 2 automaker offered cashback incentives through 
may 2 ranging from 400 to 4000 for the xr4ti which carries a 
base price of 19929 the highest rebate boosted from 3000 
equals more than 20 percent of the german cars price 
the company also extended lowfinancing offers ranging from 49 
percent interest for twoyear loans to 99 percent for fiveyear 
loans on various models buyers of some of the models covered in the 
offers had the option of taking cash incentives or the low financing 
program 
also thursday chrysler corp said it raised its stock dividend 
from 25 cents to 30 cents a share following the leads of general 
motors corp and ford motor co 
the 20 percent dividend increase is the first for chrysler since 
april 1987 the company said 
the dividend is payable april 17 to shareholders of record on 
march 15 at the end of 1988 there were about 233 million shares of 
chrysler common stock outstanding the nations no 3 automaker said

twenty years ago a deltawinged wonder known as the 
concorde 001 took off on its maiden flight lifting off gracefully 
from an airstrip in southern france and becoming the fastest 
commercial jet in the sky 
about 3000 people gathered in a hangar on thursday to toast the 
event and to promote plans for a secondgeneration concorde to carry 
passengers into the 21st century at twice the speed of sound 
plans for the new jet were unveiled wednesday at aerospatiale 
offices in the southern french city of toulouse the stateowned 
company built the concorde with british aerospace 
sir raymond lygo chief executive of british aerospace and henri 
martre president of aerospatiale said 555 million in government 
backing is being sought for developing the new jet designed to 
carry 280 passengers and travel at 1550 mph 
british airways and air france each owns seven concordes which 
can travel up to 1367 mph and carry 100 to 144 people 
the new design retains the shape of a sleek bird with a 
downturned beak which many aircraft aficionados call the worlds 
most beautiful highflying silhouette 
rolls royce which provides the engines for the present concorde 
fleet announced this week it could design a new engine that would 
be considerably lighter and greatly increase the range and 
efficiency of the jets 
those celebrating thursday included andre turcat the test pilot 
who flew the concorde 001 for 29 minutes over dozens of reporters 
and thousands of people who had jammed roads around the airfield to 
watch 
turcat later elected mayor of toulouse said when he landed 
and so at last the big bird flies and as you can see it flies 
very well 
the british concorde 002 made its first flight guided by pilot 
brian trubshaw on april 9 1969 
six months later the plane broke the sound barrier 
breaking the profit barrier was another matter 
between the first commercial flights in 1976 and 1984 the 
jetliner flew in the red 
the plane was expensive to operate and air france lost 24 
million between 1976 and 1980 annual subsidies from britain to keep 
their concordes aloft were estimated at 30 million yearly 
passenger traffic gradually increased operations were 
streamlined and the concorde showed its first profit in 1986 
in 1987 air france showed a net profit of more than 142 
million from the concordes regular parisnew york run and from 
charter flights figures for 1988 are not yet available 
last year 42379 passengers took the threehour parisnew york 
flight which got them to new york two hours before they left 
the flight is 4856 roundtrip compared to 3986 for a 
regular roundtrip firstclass seat 
faced with the early unprofitablity of the jet the high cost of
